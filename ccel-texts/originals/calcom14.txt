   TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE

   In preparing the First Volume of the Commentary On Isaiah, many
   attempts were made, but without success, to procure the French
   Translation. After much fruitless labor, and some expense, a copy of
   that rare work, which happens to be in the possession of the Parker
   Society, has been kindly lent to the Translator, who takes this
   opportunity of conveying his warmest thanks for this favor. The
   references in the foot-notes of the present and future Volumes will
   give some idea of the assistance derived from that source. But it has
   also supplied materials for a history, more complete than we could
   formerly give, of this Commentary, and of the forms in which it was
   successively brought before the public.

   Various scribes, on some occasions, united their efforts to obtain a
   perfect record of what had been uttered by the Reformer in his private
   Lessons, as they were called, which he delivered to students of
   theology. But, in the present instance, we are indebted almost
   exclusively to the earnest, judicious, and unwearied labors of one man,
   Mr. Nicolas Des Gallars, a minister of Geneva, from whose notes, after
   having been revised by the Author, the first Latin edition was printed
   in 1550. He appears to have executed, under the Author's eye, a French
   Translation, which came forth almost simultaneously with the Latin
   copy, and enjoyed the advantage of being known to be well
   authenticated. After the lapse of several years, Calvin availed himself
   of a season of leisure for re-writing this Commentary, added more than
   a third to its original size, [1] and made such extensive alterations,
   that he ventured to call it "a new work." [2] It bears the date of 15th
   January 1559. The third edition, which is dated 1583, lays claim to
   still greater accuracy; for it professes to have received corrections
   from the Author's Manuscript.

   While the Commentary was thus extensively circulated, [3] the benefits
   of it were chiefly confined to those who were acquainted with the Latin
   language; for even the French reader was left to struggle with all the
   imperfections which belonged to the first edition. At least, it was
   only eleven years before the last mentioned date, and eight years after
   the Author's death, that a new French translation appeared, which was
   printed at Geneva by Francois Perrin, in 1572. There is reason to
   believe that the first French translation would be treated by the
   second translator with great deference, and that he would scarcely
   consider himself to be at liberty to depart from it, except for the
   purpose of introducing the extensive alterations and additions which
   had been made to the original work. Let us hope that some future
   editor, having obtained access to copies now slumbering in the shelves
   of our continental neighbors, or perhaps of our own countrymen, will
   enjoy the satisfaction of collating the earlier and later editions in
   both languages, and will be enabled to reveal the steps by which this
   valuable Commentary passed from the first rough notes of the labourious
   scribe to the form which was imparted to it by the fastidious
   corrections of the Author.

   This Volume contains an "Address to the Readers" by Nicolas des
   Gallars, Latinized Gallasius, (which appears to have been prefixed to
   his French translation of the Commentary,) his Epistolary Dedication of
   the Latin edition of 1583 to a learned author and eminent printer, John
   Crispin, and a short "Address to the Readers" by the latest French
   translator, all of which, it is hoped, will be perused with deep
   interest. The relation in which Gallars stood to Calvin, and to his
   published writings, has thrown around him many pleasing associations;
   and his style, both Latin and French, displays such judgment, and
   taste, and scholarship, as justifies the marked preference given to him
   by the Reformer, and assures the reader that the responsible office
   which he held could not have been committed to abler hands.

   The Notes added to these Volumes shew that it is the aim of the Calvin
   Society not only to give exact Translations, but to aid the
   investigation of dark passages by the labors of modern critics. Among
   the works which have been consulted with greatest advantage may be
   named "The Prophecies of Isaiah, Earlier and Later, by Joseph Addison
   Alexander, Professor in the Theological Seminary, Princeton, New
   Jersey," an exceedingly valuable addition to the stores of exegetical
   theology, and not a little enhanced by the care with which the learned
   editor, Dr. Eadie, has superintended the British edition. Yet we are
   again and again constrained to remark the extent to which the critical
   researches of our own age have been anticipated by the sagacity of the
   Reformer, to whom our greatest men delight in acknowledging their
   obligations. "Calvin," says Professor Alexander, "still towers above
   all interpreters in large commanding views of revelation, in its whole
   connection, with extraordinary insight into the logical relations of a
   passage, even where its individual expressions were not fully
   understood. These qualities, together with his fixed belief of
   fundamental doctrines, his eminent soundness of judgment, and his
   freedom from all tendency to paradox, pedantic affectation, or fanciful
   conceit, place him more completely on a level with the very best
   interpreters of our day than almost any intervening writer."

   Auchterarder, 3d September, 1851.

   PREFATORY ADVERTISEMENT

   BY

   NICOLAS DES GALLARS

   TO THE READERS

   Though in collecting these Commentaries I was astonished, first, at the
   labor and difficulty, and next at the various opinions of men, yet I
   thought, Christian Readers, that I must not refuse to labor or shrink
   from anything, provided that I can be of any service. With respect to
   the difficulties, I quickly surmounted them, through the clear method
   of instruction which the Author has been accustomed to employ, as may
   be seen in his writings, but still more in his speaking. And if some
   obscure passages, of which there are many in that Prophet, made me
   pause, it was not because I had not the benefit of his judgment and
   advice in clearly explaining and revising the whole; for, in
   consequence of the familiar and daily intercourse which I had with him,
   those intricacies which might have retarded or perplexed me were easily
   disentangled and removed. Besides, at any hour when one could go by
   stealth, that is, when he had any relaxation from the weighty affairs
   which almost overwhelmed him, I read to him all that I had written, in
   order that, if he could not closely examine the whole, he might at
   least add, or take away, or give me directions, as far as was
   necessary. All this he did carefully, though hardly ever did I read to
   him two or three verses when he was not immediately called away, either
   by persons who wanted his advice, or by his friends. Yet reviewing
   these things with all the fidelity and diligence that I could, I still
   returned, and frequently put questions to him.

   As to my labor, it was partly relieved by some expository remarks which
   I had collected from his own mouth, while he was preaching; for it is
   now four years and more since he explained that Prophet to us, in a
   highly profitable manner, in public Discourses, before giving us the
   interpretation in the school. At that time, recording not only the
   faithful exhortations which relate to the correction of vices, to the
   condition of that age, and to the restoration of the purity of doctrine
   and of the Church, but also the exact interpretations on which he dwelt
   largely, in order to draw from them a solid doctrine to be applied to
   the use of the people, when I returned to the house, I wrote them down
   in Latin, so far as I remembered and had leisure. That was of great use
   to me in collecting these Commentaries; not that I put into them
   everything that I then wrote, or in the same order and method, but so
   far as I already understood the sentiments, and had been habituated, by
   some practice, to that mode of interpretation, I had not so much
   trouble as if I had come quite raw and ill-prepared to that way of
   writing.

   So far as relates to the judgments of men, who must have very various
   opinions about this labor of mine, I soon foresaw that there would be
   many of them who would take no great pleasure in that which cost me
   pain, because they would have preferred to have this written by the
   Author himself instead of being collected and arranged by me. And
   indeed I am very much of their opinion; for the whole would have been
   sent forth by him in a more complete and finished state. But as he was
   employed in preparing other works, the advantage of which is so evident
   that it is unnecessary for me to proclaim it; and as he was harassed by
   so much business that he scarcely had leisure to read, it would hardly
   have been possible for him to put his hand to that work.

   Accordingly, having been for a long time attached to that Prophet, and
   wishing clearer expositions of many passages, and now enjoying them, I
   thought that I would do what was good and profitable, if, while I
   promoted my own benefit, I had regard also to others whose desire might
   not be less than mine, and whose minds, even supposing that they had
   not so strong a desire, might be aroused by reading this Commentary,
   and might receive from it an increase of knowledge. In order,
   therefore, that you, believing Reader, might enjoy along with me the
   explanation of that Prophet, I suddenly undertook this labor, lest if
   we waited longer for these Commentaries, they might be taken from us by
   some injury or calamity in these wretched times. For we see every day
   what snares are laid by Satan for the Church, which is newly born, and
   for her faithful teachers. We meet with treachery in some, from whom we
   had expected better things; in others we find fickleness and lightness,
   and others are blinded by the glimmering of this age. There are very
   few of them who, in defense of the kingdom of Christ, oppose the
   tyrannical laws of Antichrist.

   Let us therefore welcome those who, through the unspeakable mercy of
   God, are left to us; or rather let us welcome the gifts which God has
   given them, that hereafter, as far as we shall have opportunity, we may
   provide for the Church. While we can enjoy their doctrine, let us seize
   it eagerly as the armor fitted for repelling our enemies; for there is
   great reason to believe that the Lord will take vengeance on the malice
   of men by such punishments as they deserve, and will deprive us of the
   excellent gifts with which in the present day he has adorned his
   Church. Many have great gifts of tongues, while others excel in
   interpretations, and undoubtedly they have strong claims on our
   attention; but this gift of prophecy, which surpasses all others, and
   to which we ought to be especially devoted, is generally despised.
   Hence it arises that many persons are more addicted to ostentation than
   eager to promote the salvation of the Church, and take more pleasure in
   vaunting before the people than in edifying the Church of Christ. St.
   Paul, already perceiving in his time that imminent danger, said,

   "Desire to pursue spiritual gifts, but still more that you may
   prophesy."
   (1 Corinthians 14:1.)

   For in the Christian Church the most important point, and that which we
   ought above all things to desire, is that the hidden meanings and
   divine mysteries of Scripture may be explained to us with some
   advantage. If that is wanting, the rest must gradually be thrown down,
   as we have found it to be in past ages, to the great injury of the
   whole Church.

   We must therefore devote ourselves to this gift above all others, for
   fear of abusing those passages of Scripture which have been turned to a
   wrong purpose, or of being ourselves guilty of torturing those passages
   to a meaning which is foreign to them. And especially we must throw
   ourselves on the doctrine of the prophets; for they who are faithfully
   employed in them open up a road for easily going higher, and lay a firm
   and solid foundation for salvation. Now, if that exercise was ever
   necessary, it is at the present time, when we must make war not only
   against Papists or Jews, but against dreadful monsters which, concealed
   under the appearance of men, endeavor to overturn all religion and
   humanity.

   Among all the prophets Isaiah justly holds the chief place, because he
   gives very clear testimonies concerning Christ, and places before our
   eyes the state and condition of his Church, that is, of his kingdom, as
   the reading will alone clearly shew, so that it will be unnecessary for
   me to make a long preface. He who shall have understood him well will
   be abundantly prepared for reading the other Prophets. The perusal of
   these Commentaries will enable you better to understand how well
   adapted the doctrine of Isaiah is to the present time; and if you are
   diligent and attentive, I am not afraid that you will think that I have
   labored in vain.

   Yet if you compared this work with the Sermons which the Author
   preached on that Prophet, you might well exclaim, as Æschines did with
   regard to Demosthenes, "What would you have thought if you had heard
   him speak it?" He adjusted his sentences so admirably, touched the
   hearts of his hearers, explained every thing by familiar and obvious
   examples, and treated his subjects in so popular a manner, that he
   seemed actually to place it before their eyes. Very frequently, too, an
   opportunity presented itself of discoursing on some passage, when it
   would have been impossible purposely to select out of the whole
   Scripture a passage better adapted to the place, the persons, and the
   occasion; so that all were astonished at it, and clearly understood
   that it had not been directed by the wisdom of a man, but by the Spirit
   of God; and the advantage which afterwards resulted from it fully
   verified that conclusion.

   If these Sermons can ever be published, (which I should earnestly
   desire,) you will know these things better, though the truth of what
   has been said cannot be so clearly perceived by any as by those who
   have seen them with their eyes. Here you have the substance, however,
   both of the Sermons and of the Lessons, from which I shall reckon
   myself to have derived great benefit, if you partake of it as you
   ought. It was my study, it was the object which I proposed to myself,
   not to have any favor from men, but to be of advantage to believers;
   and, so far as my conscience bears me witness, I see not why I ought to
   dread the judgment of men. I hold it to be certain that they who shall
   carefully weigh the whole will judge of me with candour; and that, if
   there be any fault or omission in what I have done, they will
   cheerfully lay in the balance the benefit which they shall have derived
   from the work.

   EPISTOLARY DEDICATION

   BY

   NICOLAS DES GALLARS

   TO HIS ANCIENT FRIEND,

   JOHN CRISPIN

   Whenever I call to remembrance, my dear Crispin, (as I cannot but often
   do,) that eminent and godly pastor of the Church, John Calvin, I have a
   feeling of deep grief, and at the same time of joy. For when I bring
   before my mind the candour and uprightness of that man, his kind
   disposition towards me, and the pleasant and intimate friendship which
   I enjoyed with him for sixteen years, it is impossible that I should
   not be deeply affected by the loss of such a friend, or, I ought rather
   to say, of such a parent. Nor is it only on my own account that I
   grieve, but rather on account of the whole Church, which has been
   deprived of so great a man, and has thus sustained a heavy loss by his
   death.

   What labors, what watchings and solicitudes he endured, with what
   faithfulness and wisdom he attended to the interests of all, with what
   frankness and courtesy he received those who visited him, how ready and
   clear were his replies to those who consulted him even on the
   weightiest matters, how learnedly, both in private and in public, he
   solved the difficult and perplexing questions which were proposed to
   him, with what gentleness he comforted the afflicted and cheered those
   who were faint and sorrowful, with what firmness he resisted
   adversaries, and with what energy he was wont to restrain the haughty
   and obstinate, with what strength of mind he bore adversity, what
   moderation he exercised in prosperity, and, in short, with what ability
   and cheerfulness he performed all the duties of a true and faithful
   servant of God, I certainly cannot find words to express! Lest any one
   should think that the ardor of my regard for him prompts me to make
   these statements, let him consider the actual facts, which truly exceed
   the power both of speech and of thought. Besides the writings and
   records which convey a stupendous testimony of his virtues, many things
   were done and many were spoken by him which cannot be made known to
   all, as they are known to those who were present when he did or uttered
   them.

   When I recall those remarkable events, my grief is alleviated; and the
   advantage which is derived from them, and which is shared with me by so
   many godly men, gives me consolation. My joy is of such a nature, and
   is so steady and full, that it swallows up all my sorrow and
   lamentation however great. And on this ground also do I congratulate
   you, my dear Crispin, that you not only peruse with the highest delight
   the works and writings of that man whom you ardently loved, but labor
   to impart them to others. Those treasures of wisdom are thus enlarged,
   and return with high interest to those from whom they come. You thus
   cause the regret for the loss of so great a man to be alleviated, and
   the grief produced by his lamented and early death to be diminished.

   For the third time, after having been wrought and polished on your
   anvil, this book now comes forth, which I may truly call a treasure,
   because it contains vast riches of heavenly grace, and opens up the
   path to what is greater. Whoever shall give to it a cheerful and
   labourious perusal, let him know with certainty that he will not return
   empty; for he will gather what shall be advantageous with regard not
   only to this Prophet but to all the other Prophets, and to the whole of
   Scripture, and if he attend to the directions which are scattered
   throughout the book, he will undoubtedly possess a strong light for
   beholding and enjoying those things which were hidden and concealed
   from many. By frequently applying your hand, therefore, to this work,
   you not only gratify me, who first sent it forth after long and severe
   toil, but you gratify all those who have perused or even tasted the
   work. You might have sufficiently perceived and actually known this
   from the numerous copies which have been already circulated.

   I have not been disappointed in the expectation which I at that time
   formed, when during the whole period of four years, with unwearied
   toil, having first heard the public Sermons and afterwards the private
   Lectures, but employing my own judgment and style, I returned home and
   committed these things to writing. And whenever I recollect that
   period, during which this Church, which formerly was small and feeble,
   received wonderful accessions, I cannot but feel the utmost joy. You
   also may well remember what was its condition when, banished from your
   native country, you first came hither; and likewise what large
   additions had been made to it when you brought your family, and settled
   down permanently here for the express purpose of assisting the efforts
   of the godly by your skill and industry.

   These things I take pleasure in relating, in order that, by calling to
   remembrance what you have experienced, I may quicken your zeal, and may
   stimulate you to perform those things which you have undertaken, and of
   which it will be impossible for you ever to repent, and may give a
   fresh impulse even to your cheerful and willing exertions. Proceed
   then, my dear Crispin, in assisting by your diligence the efforts of
   those who are devoted to Sacred Literature, and labor not only to
   promote this work, but also to publish others. You see that many
   things, though useful in the highest degree, are passed by and almost
   neglected by those who aim at immediate gain rather than at public
   usefulness.

   The smaller Treatises of this Author were edited by me fifteen years
   ago; and although since that time he wrote many other Treatises, yet no
   one put his hand to that work, so as to bring out a uniform edition, (I
   speak of the Latin copies,) either of those or of others which were
   afterwards added. I therefore earnestly and repeatedly urge my request,
   that you will take charge of those works, and also of others with which
   you are well acquainted, and that you will not allow any of the
   writings of so great a man to be lost; and, in short, that you will
   grant the request made to you by godly and studious persons, and that
   you will fulfill and go beyond those expectations respecting you which
   you have already excited. May God favor your undertakings, and make you
   prosperous and happy!

   Geneva, January 1, 1570

   THE FRENCH TRANSLATOR'S

   PREFATORY ADDRESS

   TO THE READERS.

   It is upwards of twenty years, my dear Readers, since the Lessons of
   Mr. John Calvin, having been collected by Mr. Nicolas Des Gallars, were
   published under the title of a Commentary, and dedicated to that
   illustrious Prince, of blessed memory, Edward VI., King of England.
   Long afterwards, the Author himself, revising that collection printed
   in Latin and in French, was not satisfied with merely revising it, so
   as to elucidate what might be obscure on account of its brevity, and to
   arrange better what was confused, but labored so diligently and so
   successfully, that he enlarged it in Latin, by more than a third, with
   excellent and necessary matter for understanding the text, putting
   everything so completely in its proper order, that if any person will
   take the trouble of comparing the first Commentary, or Collection of
   Lessons, with this second edition, he will find that what we have said
   is true.

   What is more, it was not in the school that this Commentary was
   collected for the second time, but it was written in the house, and
   word for word, under the eye of the Author, who has so skillfully
   arranged and digested the whole, that when you read it, you will
   perceive that in this book, as in others which have already come forth
   from him, he did much good service to the Church of God, and faithfully
   pointed out the road to those who wish to make progress in the study of
   theology, especially by these Commentaries, which, when they are read
   attentively, will not only be very useful for explaining the true
   meaning of the prophet Isaiah, but will not less contribute to throw
   light on many passages of the other books of the Holy Scripture. This
   has induced me to translate them anew into French, in order that those
   of you who do not understand the Latin tongue may not be deprived of
   such an advantage. Read, and profit in the fear of the Lord.

   CHAPTER 17.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Isaiah Chapter 17:1-14

   1. The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a
   city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.

   1. Onus Damasci. Ecce Damascus ablata est, ne sit civitas; nam erit
   acervus ruinæ.

   2. The Cities of Aroer are forsaken; they shall be for flocks, which
   shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.

   2. Derelictæ sunt urbes Aroer, in caulus vertentur; accubabunt, nec
   erit qui exterreat.

   3. The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from
   Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the glory of the
   children of Israel, saith the Lord of hosts.

   3. Et cessabit præsidium ab Ephraim, et regnum a Damasco. Et reliquiæ
   Syriæ, quasi gloriæ filiorum Israel erunt, dicit Iehova exercituum.

   4. And in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob shall
   be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean.

   4. Et erit in die illa, attenuabitur gloria Iacob, et pinguedo carnis
   ejus macrescet.

   5. And it shall be, as when the harvest-man gathereth the corn, and
   reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathereth
   ears in the valley of Rephaim.

   5. Et erit sicut qui colligit messem segitis, qui brachio suo spicas
   metit; similiter ut quis colligit spicas in valle Rephaim.

   6. Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive
   tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or
   five in the outmost fruitful branches therof, saith the Lord God of
   Israel.

   6. Et relinquetur in ea racematio, sicut excussio oleæ; duæ illic aut
   tres baccæ restant in cacumine altioris rami, quatuor aut quinque in
   expansis ramis fructus ejus, dicit Iehova Deus Israel.

   7. At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have
   respect to the Holy One of Israel.

   7. In die illa respiciet homo ad factorem suum, et oculi ejus ad
   sanctum Israelis intuebuntur.

   8. And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither
   shall respect that which his fingers have made, either the groves or
   the images.

   8. Nec respiciet ad altaria opus manuum suarum, non aspiciet quæ
   fecerunt digiti ejus, nec lucos, nec simulachra.

   9. In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an
   uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel:
   and there shall be desolation.

   9. In die illa erunt urbes fortitudinis ejus, quasi derelictio virgulti
   et frondis, quemadmodum reliquerunt coram filiis Israel; et erit
   desolatio.

   10. Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not
   been mindful of the Rock of thy strength, therefore shalt thou plant
   pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange slips:

   10. Quoniam oblita es Dei salutis tuæ, nec memor fuisti Dei
   fortitudinis; idcirco plantabis plantas amoenas, et palmitem alienum
   conseres.

   11. In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the morning
   shalt thou make thy seed to flourish; but the harvest shall be a heap
   in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow

   11. Die plantationis tuæ crescere facies eam, et mane germinare facies
   semen tuum; sed recedet messis in die fruendi, et erit dolor
   desperatus.

   12. Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the
   noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that make a rushing
   like the rushing of mighty waters!

   12. Hei multitudo populorum multorum; instar sonitus maris sonabunt, et
   strepitus nationum; instar strepitus aquarum ingentium tumultuabuntur.

   13. The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but God
   shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as
   the chaff of the mountains before the wind; and like a rolling thing
   before the whirlwind.

   13. Strepent populi instar strepitus aquarum ingentium, et increpabit
   eum, et fugiet procul; fugabitur quasi stipula montium coram vento, et
   quasi globus coram turbine.

   14. And behold at evening-tide trouble; and before the morning he is
   not. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot of them
   that rob us.

   14. Tempore vespertino ecce turbatio; antequam sit mane, nusquam erit.
   Hæc est pars conculcantium nos, et sors eorum qui nos diripiunt.


   1. The burden of Damascus. Here he prophesies against the kingdom of
   Syria, and mentions the chief city in which the seat of the kingdom
   lay. It was proper that this calamity, like others which came before
   it, should be described, that the righteous might confidently believe
   that God would one day assist them, and would not always permit them to
   be oppressed by the wicked without end. The king of Syria had formed an
   alliance with Israel against Judah, as we saw formerly in the seventh
   chapter; and as the Jews were not able to contend with him, and were
   deprived of other aids, they might also entertain doubts about God's
   assistance, as if he had utterly abandoned them. To free them,
   therefore, from these doubts, he threatens the destruction of that
   kingdom, from which they would readily conclude that God fought in
   defense of his people.

   It is uncertain at what time Isaiah uttered this prophecy, for, as I
   have already remarked, he does not follow the order of time in
   threatening against each nation the punishment which it deserved. But,
   as far as I am able to conjecture, he foretold those events at the time
   when those two kings, that is, the kings of Israel and Syria, invaded
   Judea, and entered into a league to destroy it and the whole Church,
   (Isaiah 7:1, 2;) for, by joining together the Israelites and the
   Syrians, he summons them to a mutual judgment, in order to show that
   the only advantage which they had derived from the wicked and
   disgraceful conspiracy was, to be involved in the same destruction. In
   this manner Isaiah intended to comfort godly persons who were of the
   tribe of Judah; for he has his eye chiefly on them, that they may not
   be discouraged, and not on the Syrians, or even the Israelites, whose
   destruction he foretells.

   Behold, Damascus is taken away. The demonstrative particle, Behold,
   seals the certainty of the prophecy. When he expressly mentions
   Damascus, it does not follow from this that the other parts of the
   kingdom are exempted, but it was customary with the prophets to take a
   part for the whole, so as to include under the destruction of the
   metropolis the fate of the whole nation; for what must ordinary towns
   expect when the citadel of the kingdom has been stormed? Yet there is
   another reason why the Prophets pronounce heavier threatenings on the
   chief and royal cities, and especially direct their discourse against
   them. It is, because a polluted flood of crimes overflows from them
   into the whole country.

   2. The cities of Aroer are forsaken. It is not probable that Aroer here
   denotes the city which is mentioned elsewhere, (Numbers 32:34;
   Deuteronomy 2:36, 3:12, 4:48;) but it is rather the name of a country.
   He draws the picture of a country which has been ruined; for he shews
   that those places in which cities had been built will be devoted to
   pasture, and that no habitation will be left there but huts and
   shepherds' tents; for if any inhabitants remained, the shepherds would
   drive their flocks to some other place.

   3. The fortress shall cease. [4] He points out the reason why the Lord
   determines to cut off the kingdom of Syria. Amos (Amos 1:3) enumerates
   additional reasons, but the most important was that which the Prophet
   mentions, namely, that they had drawn the kingdom of Israel to their
   side for the purpose of making war against the Jews. The Israelites
   were undoubtedly allured, by the blandishments of the Syrians, to form
   an alliance with them against their brethren. It was a pretext
   exceedingly fitted to impose upon them, that the Syrians would aid them
   against all their enemies; and hence also the Israelites placed
   confidence in the forces and power of the Syrians to such an extent,
   that they reckoned themselves able to oppose any adversary. All Israel
   is here, as in many other passages, denoted by the name Ephraim, which
   was the chief tribe of that people. Now, "the assistance and kingdom"
   are said to "cease" from any place, when its strength is broken and its
   rank is thrown down.

   And the remnant of Syria. That is, both of these nations, the Syrians
   and the Israelites, shall be brought to nothing; and, for the purpose
   of giving additional weight to the prophecy, he states that it is God
   who declares it; for he immediately adds these words, saith Jehovah of
   hosts Now, when the Lord punished so severely those two kingdoms, he
   unquestionably promoted in this way the benefit of his Church,
   delivering it by the destruction of its enemies. And, indeed, in
   destroying both nations, he employed as his agents the Assyrians, to
   whom even the Jews had applied; and although in this respect they had
   heinously sinned, yet their offense did not hinder the Lord from
   promoting the benefit of his Church, or from delivering it by bringing
   its enemies into conflict with each other. Hence we perceive how great
   is the care which God exercises over us, since he does not spare even
   the greatest kingdoms in order to preserve us. We ought also to
   observe, that though all the wicked enter into a league, and join hands
   to destroy us, yet the Lord will easily rescue us from their jaws.
   Besides, we ought to remark that it is advantageous to us to be
   deprived of earthly aids, on which it is in vain for us to rely in
   opposition to God; for when we are blinded by our prosperity, we
   flatter ourselves, and cannot hear the voice of God. It therefore
   becomes necessary to remove these obstructions, that we may perceive
   our helplessness, as was the case with the Israelites, who were bereft
   of their aid after Syria had been destroyed.

   4. The glory of Jacob shall be diminished. [5] Although he had
   undertaken to speak of Syria and Damascus, he takes occasion to join
   Israel with the Syrians, because they were bound by a mutual league,
   and were united in the same cause. The Syrians, indeed, whom Isaiah
   chiefly addresses, were like a torch to inflame the Israelites, as we
   have already said. But the Israelites themselves were equally in fault,
   and therefore they were justly drawn, by what might be called a mutual
   bond, to endure the same punishment.

   It is not easy to say whether under the name Jacob he speaks of the
   whole elect people, so as to include also the tribe of Judah. But it is
   probable that he refers only to the ten tribes, who laid claim to the
   name of the nation, and that it is in mockery that he describes them as
   glorious, because, being puffed up with their power and multitude and
   allies, they despised the Jews their brethren.

   And the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean. When he next threatens
   them with leanness, his object is to reprove their indolence, as the
   Prophets frequently reprove them for their fatness (Jeremiah 5:28;
   50:11.) On account of their prosperity and of the fertility of the
   country, they became proud, as horses that are fat and excessively
   pampered grow restive. Hence also they are elsewhere called "fat cows"
   (Amos 4:1). But however fierce and stubborn they might be, God
   threatens that he will take away their fatness with which they were
   puffed up.

   5. And it shall be as when the harvest-man gathereth the corn. He shews
   by a comparison how great will be the desolation. "As the reapers," he
   says, "gather the corn in armfuls, so this multitude, though large and
   extended, will be mowed down by the enemies." Now that he may not leave
   a remainder, he adds that at the conclusion of the harvest the ears
   will be gleaned, as if he had said, that when the multitude shall have
   been destroyed and the country laid bare like a field which has been
   reaped, even the shaken and scattered ears will not be left. Besides,
   he employs the metaphor of a harvest because the people, trusting to
   their great number, dreaded nothing; but as the reapers are not
   terrified by the large quantity of the corn, so he declares that their
   vast number will not prevent God from utterly destroying them. This may
   also refer to the Assyrians, but the meaning will be the same, for they
   were God's servants in executing this vengeance.

   We need not spend much time in explaining the word gather, for it means
   nothing else than that the slaughter will resemble a harvest, the
   conclusion of which has been followed by the gleaning of the ears. When
   the ten tribes had been carried away, the Assyrians, having learned
   that they were meditating a revolution, destroyed them also (2 Kings
   17:4). He especially mentions the valley of Rephaim, because its
   fertility was well known to the Israelites.

   6. Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it. This metaphor has a
   different meaning from the former; for as if the name of the nation
   were to be entirely blotted out, he had expressly foretold that nothing
   would be left after the slaughter. He now adds a consolation, and thus
   abates the severity of the destruction; for he declares that, although
   the enemies had resolved to consume and destroy everything, still some
   remnant would be left. In like manner the gleaning of grapes is never
   made so completely as not to allow some grapes or even clusters to
   remain, which were concealed under the leaves, and the olive tree is
   never so thoroughly shaken as not to leave at least some olives on the
   tops of the trees. Consequently, to whatever extent the enemies may
   rage, and even the vengeance of God may be kindled, still he foretells
   that the Judge, notwithstanding his severity, will reserve for himself
   a small number, and will not allow the attacks of enemies to fall upon
   his own elect.

   Hence it follows, that amidst the heaviest vengeance there will still
   be room for mercy. The present discourse relates to the posterity of
   Abraham; and though they had revolted from God so as to deserve to be
   cast off, yet the goodness of God rose above their wickedness. They had
   indeed rendered themselves unworthy of such goodness, but the covenant
   of God must remain firm and impregnable, and a proof of that firmness
   must be given by him in some remnant, though the nation entirely set it
   aside as far as lay in their power. This ought to be carefully
   observed, so that when we perceive no traces of the Church, and when
   the godly appear to be destroyed, still we may not think that the
   Church has perished; for the promise of the Lord stands, that it will
   continue for ever (Genesis 17:7). Some remnant, therefore, will always
   remain, though frequently it is not visible to our eyes.

   7. At that day shall a man look to his Maker. He now shews the fruit of
   this chastisement, and this is the second consolation with which the
   godly ought to fortify themselves amidst their afflictions. Although
   they perceive nothing but the wrath of God, yet they ought to reflect
   that the Lord, who never forgets himself, will continually preserve his
   Church, and not only so, but that the chastisements will be
   advantageous to them. After having spoken, therefore, about the
   continual existence of the Church, he next adds, that men will look to
   God This is the most desirable of all, for when men betake themselves
   to God, the world, which was formerly disordered, is restored to its
   proper order; but when we have been estranged from him, no one repents
   of his own accord, and therefore there is no other way in which we can
   be brought back than to be driven by the scourge of chastisements. We
   are thus reminded that we ought not to be so impatient in enduring
   chastisements, which cure us of the fearfully dangerous disease of
   apostasy.

   To look to God means nothing else than that, when we have turned away,
   we return to a state of favor with him, betake ourselves and are
   converted to him. For how comes it that men abandon themselves to every
   kind of wickedness but because they forget God? Where the knowledge of
   God exists, there reverence dwells; where forgetfulness of God is
   found, there contempt of him also prevails. Yet this relates properly
   to faith, as if he had said, "When chastisements so severe shall have
   tamed the Israelites, they will then perceive that there is no help for
   them but in God." For this reason he immediately adds the expression,
   To his Maker. It was indeed a proof of abominable indolence that they
   did not rely on God alone, who had bestowed on them so many precious
   gifts. The Prophet therefore says, that when they had been subdued by
   distresses and afflictions, they would afterwards return to a sound
   mind, so as to begin to hope in him who had bound them to himself by so
   many acts of kindness. And indeed he calls God their Maker, not as
   having created the whole human race, but in the same sense in which he
   likewise calls him The Holy One of Israel. Although therefore all men
   were created after the image of God, (Genesis 1:27), yet Israel was
   peculiarly his workmanship, because he was his heritage, and his holy
   and chosen people (Exodus 19:6). This repetition, in accordance with
   the ordinary custom of the Hebrew language, is employed to denote the
   same thing. He therefore calls God Holy, not only as viewed in himself,
   but from the effect produced, because he has sanctified or separated to
   himself the children of Abraham. Hence it follows, that the creation
   which he speaks of must be understood to relate to spiritual
   reformation, in reference to which he is especially called the Maker of
   Israel (Isaiah 45:11; Hosea 8:14).

   8. And he shall not look to the altars. This contrast shews more
   clearly that the looking which he spoke of in the former verse relates
   strictly to hope and confidence, for he says that every kind of sinful
   confidence will vanish away when men have learned to hope in God; and
   indeed in no other manner can any one obtain clear views of God than by
   driving far from him all superstitions. We are thus taught that
   obstacles of this kind ought to be removed if we wish to approach to
   God. It is vain to think of making a union between God and idols, as
   the Papists do, and as the Jews formerly did; for that vice is not
   peculiar to our age, but has prevailed in all ages. Every obstruction
   ought therefore to be removed, that we may look to God with such
   earnestness as to have just and clear views of him, and to put our
   trust in him.

   The work of his hands. It is for the purpose of exciting abhorrence
   that he calls the false gods the work of their hands, that the
   Israelites, being ashamed of their folly, may shake off and drive away
   from them such a disgraceful reproach. On this vice, however, he dwells
   the more largely, because they were more chargeable with it than with
   any other, and because none can be more abominable in the sight of God.
   There were innumerable superstitions among them, and in places without
   number they had set up both idols and altars, so that Isaiah had good
   reason for reproving and expostulating with them at great length on
   account of these crimes.

   It might be objected that the altar at Jerusalem was also built by men,
   and therefore they ought to forsake it in order to approach to God.
   (Exodus 27:1). I reply, that altar was widely different from others,
   for although it consisted of stone and mortar, silver and gold, and was
   made like others by the agency of men, yet we ought not to look at the
   materials or the workmanship, but at God himself who was the maker, for
   by his command it was built. We ought therefore to consider the
   essential form, so to speak, which it received from the word of God;
   other matters ought not to be taken into view, since God alone is the
   architect. (Exodus 20:24, 25; Deuteronomy 27:5, 6). Other altars,
   though they bore some resemblance to it, should be abhorred, because
   they had not the authority of the word. Such is the estimate which we
   ought to form of every kind of false worship, whatever appearance of
   sanctity it may assume; for God cannot approve of anything that is not
   supported by his word.

   9. In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough. He
   follows out what he had begun to say about driving out the inhabitants
   of the country; and as the Israelites, trusting to their fortified
   cities and to their bulwarks, thought that they were in safety, he
   threatens that they will be of no more use than if enemies were
   marching through desert places. The view entertained by some, that
   chvrs (chOrEsh) and zvvt (azubath) [6] are proper names of towns, is a
   forced interpretation. I understand them rather to denote unpleasant
   and disagreeable places, or that the walls and ditches will contribute
   no more to their defense than if the Israelites dwelt amidst thickets
   and bushes.

   As they left. [7] Here the particle 'sr, (asher,) I have no doubt,
   denotes comparison; and therefore I have rendered it in like manner as,
   which makes the statement of the Prophet to be, in connection with what
   had been already said, that the people would tremble and flee and be
   scattered, in the same manner as God had formerly driven out the
   ancient inhabitants. Those who think that 'sr, (asher,) is a relative
   are constrained to supply something, and to break up the thread of the
   discourse. But it simply brings to their remembrance an ancient
   example, that the Israelites may perceive how vain and deceitful is
   every kind of defense that is opposed to the arm of God. It is a severe
   reproach; for the Israelites did not consider that the Lord gave to
   them that land, as it were, by hereditary right, in order that they
   might worship him, and that he drove out their enemies to put them in
   possession of it. And now, by their ingratitude, they rendered
   themselves unworthy of so great a benefit; and, consequently, when they
   had been deprived of it, there was good reason why they should feel
   distresses which were the reverse of their former blessings.

   This passage will be made more plain by the writings of Moses, whom the
   prophets follow; for in the promises he employs this mode of
   expression, "One of you shall chase a thousand," (Leviticus 26:8;
   Joshua 23:10), and in the threatenings, on the other hand, he says,
   "One shall chase a thousand of you." (Deuteronomy 32:30.) Accordingly,
   as he struck such terror into the Canaanites, that at the sight of the
   Israelites they immediately fled, so he punished the ingratitude of the
   people in such a manner that they had no power to resist. Thus the Lord
   gave a display of his power in two ways, both in driving out the
   Canaanites and in punishing his people. The Prophet, therefore, by
   mentioning that ancient kindness, reproaches the people with
   ingratitude, forgetfulness, and treachery, that they may acknowledge
   that they are justly punished, and may perceive that it proceeds from
   the Lord, that they are thus chased by the enemies to whom they were
   formerly a terror.

   10. Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation. He shews the
   reason why the Lord exercises such severity against the Ten Tribes,
   that they may not complain of being unjustly afflicted or too harshly
   treated. The sum of what is stated is, that all those evils come to
   them because they have wickedly despised God. It was excessively base
   and altogether inexcusable ingratitude, after having received so many
   favors, to prostitute their hopes to heathen nations and to idols, as
   if they had never in any respect experienced the love of God. Indeed,
   no unbelievers, when they are called to account, will vindicate
   themselves from the charge of offering an insult to God by wandering
   after creatures. But the argument was applicable, in a special manner,
   to the people of Israel, to whom God had revealed himself in such a
   manner that they ought to have left off all the impostures of the world
   and relied on his grace alone. They are therefore justly accused of
   ingratitude, for having buried in forgetfulness the object of true
   faith; and indeed, when God has once allowed us to taste the delight of
   his goodness, if it gain a place in our hearts, we shall never be drawn
   away from it to anything else. Hence it follows that they are convicted
   of ingratitude who, not being satisfied with the true God, are unsteady
   and driven about in all directions; for in this manner they despise his
   invaluable grace.

   Accordingly, the Prophet expressly calls him the God of salvation and
   the God or Rock of strength tsvr (tsur) has both significations; for it
   was a monstrous thing that they were not kept in fidelity to God, who
   had so often preserved them, and, as it were, with an outstretched
   hand. When he adds that they had not been mindful, this is an
   amplification; for he indirectly charges them with base slothfulness in
   not considering in how many ways they had formerly been made to know
   the kindness of God.

   Therefore thou shalt plant. Next follows the punishment, that they
   might not think that this ingratitude would remain unpunished. That is,
   because they forsook the fountain of all good, though they labor to
   obtain food, yet they will be consumed by famine and hunger; for all
   that shall be obtained with great labor the enemy will either carry
   away or destroy. This passage is taken from Moses; for it is a curse
   pronounced amidst other curses.

   "The fruit of thy land, and all thy labors, shall a nation which thou
   knowest not eat up." (Deuteronomy 28:33).

   Hence we see what I have often mentioned before, that the prophets
   borrow many things from Moses, and are the true interpreters of the
   law. He speaks of choice vines and branches taken from them; because
   the greatness of the loss aggravates the sorrow.

   11. In the day. This denotes the incessant labor which is bestowed on
   plants and seeds. Yet we might understand by it the fruit which is
   yielded, as if a vine newly planted would immediately produce wine. And
   this agrees with the next clause, in which the morning is put for the
   day. This appears to denote sudden maturity, unless perhaps this also
   be supposed to denote carefulness, because from the very earliest dawn
   they will devote themselves to labor.

   The words are somewhat ambiguous; for some render them, "the removing
   of the branch on the day of affliction." But as nchlch (nachalah) means
   "an inheritance," here, in my opinion, it literally denotes produce. It
   is not derived from chlh (chalah,) and I do not see how the word
   "Branch" agrees with it. I grant, indeed, that as vines are mentioned,
   the word Harvest is employed (katachrestikos) differently from its
   natural meaning.

   It might also be rendered a Collector; and yet I do not choose to
   dispute keenly about those two significations, for the meaning will be
   the same, provided that nchlch (nachalah) be understood to denote "the
   gathering of the fruits." In this way the passage will flow easily
   enough. "Though you labor hard in dressing the vines, and though you
   begin your toil at the earliest dawn, you will gain nothing; for by the
   mere shaking of the branches the fruit will fall off of its own accord,
   or your vines will be plundered." Thus, by a figure of speech in which
   a part is taken for the whole, the word plant denotes that unwearied
   toil which husbandmen and vine-dressers are wont to bestow on plants
   and vines.

   This is a very severe punishment, and undoubtedly proceeds from the
   curse of God; for if he who has no possession be driven out and
   banished from a country, he will not be rendered so uneasy as the man
   who has well cultivated fields, and particularly if he has bestowed his
   labor on them for a long time. In this manner the Lord determined to
   punish the Israelites, because they abused the fertility of the country
   and grew wanton amidst their abundance. A similar punishment is also
   threatened against the wicked in general terms, that "in vain do they
   rise early, and vex themselves with unremitted toil;" for they gain
   nothing by it. (Psalm 127:2). On the other hand, it is declared that
   they who trust in the Lord will undoubtedly receive the reward of their
   toil, for the blessing of God will accompany their labors. (Psalm
   128:2, 4).

   12. Alas [8] for the multitude! Some render Woe, making it to denote
   execration. Sometimes, as we have seen elsewhere, it is employed in
   calling to a person; but on the present occasion I rather think that it
   betokens sorrow, [9] for he groans on account of the calamity which he
   foresees will befall Israel, and he does so either out of brotherly
   affection, or in order that the prophecy may make a more powerful
   impression on the minds of a sluggish and indolent people. It is
   certain, that the prophets regarded with greater horror than other men
   the vengeance of God, of which they were the heralds; and although, in
   sustaining the character assigned to them, they threatened severely,
   still they never laid aside human feelings, so as not to have
   compassion on those who perished. But the chief reason was a
   consideration of the covenant which God had made with the seed of
   Abraham; and we see that Paul also had this feeling to such an extent,
   that he "wished to be accursed for his brethren." (Romans 9:3). When
   therefore Isaiah brings the fact before his mind, he cannot but be
   deeply affected with grief; and yet, as I have hinted, it tends to make
   the fact more certain, when he places it before his eyes as if he
   actually saw it.

   The word multitude is here employed, because the army had been
   collected out of many and various nations, of which the Assyrian
   monarchy was composed. The metaphors which he adds are intended for no
   other purpose than to exhibit more forcibly what has been already
   stated; for he compares them to a sea or a deluge, which overflows a
   whole country.

   13. The nations shall rush. Although he appears to follow out that
   threatening, which he formerly uttered, yet he begins to comfort
   believers by repeating the same statement, as if we should say, "They
   who were unmindful of God must be punished for their wicked revolt, and
   must be, as it were, overwhelmed by a deluge; but the Lord will
   restrain this savage disposition of the enemies, for, when they have
   exercised their cruelty, he shall find a method of casting them out and
   driving them away." This is a remarkable consolation, by which he
   intended to support the remnant of the godly. Nor does he speak of the
   Jews only, as is commonly supposed, for hitherto he has addressed his
   discourse to the ten tribes, and it is certain that there were still
   left in Israel some who actually feared God, and who would have
   despaired if they had not been upheld by some promise.

   By these metaphors he describes dreadful storms and tempests. When the
   Holy Spirit intends to bring comfort to the godly, he holds out those
   objects which are wont to terrify and discourage the minds of men, that
   we may learn that God will easily allay all tempests, however violent
   and dreadful. As the winds and seas and storms are at his command, so
   it is easy for him to restrain enemies and their violence; and
   therefore immediately afterwards he compares the Assyrians to chaff.

   As the chaff of the mountains before the wind. Although with regard to
   the Israelites their attack was terrible, yet he shews that before God
   they will be like chaff, for without any effort he will scatter all
   their forces. Hence it follows that we ought not to judge of their
   resources and strength by our senses. Whenever therefore we see the
   restraints laid on the wicked withdrawn, [10] that they may rush
   forward for our destruction, let us indeed consider that, so far as
   lies in ourselves, we are ruined, but that God can easily frustrate
   their attacks. glgl (galgal) means a rolling thing, [11] which is
   easily driven by the wind.

   14. And, behold, at evening tide trouble. The meaning is, "As when a
   storm has been raised in the evening, and soon afterwards allayed, no
   trace of it is found in the morning, so will cheerful prosperity
   suddenly arise, contrary to expectation." The Prophet intended to state
   two things -- first, that the attack of the enemy will be sudden; and
   secondly, that the ravages which they shall commit will not be of long
   duration. As the Assyrians rose suddenly against the Israelites, so
   their fall was sudden.

   From this passage all the godly ought to draw wonderful consolation,
   whenever they see that everything is in disorder, and when dreadful
   changes are at hand; for what is it but a sudden storm which the Lord
   will allay? Tyrants rush upon us like storms and whirlwinds, but the
   Lord will easily dispel their rage. Let us therefore patiently wait for
   his assistance; for though he permit us to be tossed about, yet through
   the midst of the tempests he will at length conduct us "to the haven."
   (Psalm 107:30.) And if the Prophet comforted a small remnant, who
   appeared to be almost none at all, this promise undoubtedly belongs to
   us also. True, we are almost none, and a wretched church is concealed
   in a few corners; but if we look at the condition of the kingdom of
   Israel, how few were the servants of God in it! And these hardly
   ventured to mutter, such was the universal hatred of religion and
   godliness. Although therefore the Lord destroy the multitude of the
   wicked, yet to the small number of the godly, who may be said to be
   tossed about in the same ship with them, he will hold out a plank to
   rescue them from shipwreck, and will guide them safely and comfortably
   into the harbour.

   This is the portion. He addresses the believers who were concealed in
   the kingdom of Israel, and joins them with the Church, although, as is
   frequently the case with the children of God, the members were
   scattered in every direction. We see here what will be the end of the
   wicked who have persecuted us. Though we are exposed to their rage, so
   that they tear and plunder and trample upon us, and inflict on us every
   kind of insult, yet they will be like storms which are subdued by their
   own violence and quickly disappear. We ought to expect that this will
   be the lot of all the tyrants who at the present day wretchedly harass
   the Church, and treat cruelly the children of God. Let this consolation
   be engraved on our minds, that we may know that the same thing will
   happen to them.

   CHAPTER 18
     __________________________________________________________________

   Isaiah Chapter 18:1-7

   1. Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers of
   Ethiopia:

   1. Heus terra inumbrans alis, quæ est trans flumina Æthiopiæ.

   2. That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes
   upon the water, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation scattered
   and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a
   nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!

   2. Mittens per mare legatos, in vasis junceis super aquas. Ite nuntii
   celeres ad gentem distractam et expilatam, ad populum formidabilem ab
   eo et deinceps, gentem undique conculcatam, cujus terram flumina
   diripuerunt.

   3. All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see ye,
   when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when he bloweth a
   trumpet, hear ye.

   3. Omnes habitatores orbis, et incolæ terræ, cum signum sustulerit in
   montibus, videbitis; cum tuba clanxerit, audietis.

   4. For so the Lord said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will
   consider in my dwelling-place like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a
   cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.

   4. Porro sic mihi dixit Iehova, Quiescam, et videbo in tabernaculo meo,
   sicut calor siccans pluviam, et sicut nubes roscida in calore messis.

   5. For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape
   is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with
   pruning-hooks, and take away and cut down the branches.

   5. Quia dum adfuerit messis, perfectum erit germen, et ex flore fructus
   erit maturescens; tum amputabit ipsos palmites falcibus, et propagines
   auferendo exscindet.

   6. They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and to
   the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer upon them, and all
   the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.

   6. Derelinquentur pariter volatili montium et animalibus terræ.
   Æstivabit super illud volatile, et omnia animalia terræ hyemabunt.

   7. In that time shall the present be brought unto the Lord of hosts of
   a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their
   beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden under foot, whose
   land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the Lord of
   hosts, the mount Zion.

   7. Tempore illo adducetur Iehovæ exercituum munus, populus laceratus et
   expilatus, et de populo terribili, ex quo esse coepit et deinceps;
   gente undique conculcata, cujus terram flumina diripuerunt, ad locum
   nominis Iehovæ exercituum, ad montem Sion.


   1. Woe to the land. I cannot determine with certainty what is the
   nation of which Isaiah speaks, though he shews plainly that it bordered
   on Ethiopia. Some consider it to refer to the whole of Egypt; but this
   is a mistake, for in the next chapter he treats of Egypt separately,
   from which it is evident that the people here meant were distinct from
   the Egyptians. Some think that the Troglodytes are here meant, which
   does not appear to me to be probable, for they had no intercourse with
   other nations, because their language, as geographers tell us, was
   hissing and not speech; [12] but those who are mentioned evidently had
   intercourse and leagues with other nations.

   Still it is uncertain whether they leagued against the Jews or joined
   with the Egyptians in driving out the Assyrians. If they were avowed
   enemies to the Jews, Isaiah threatens punishment; but if they deceived
   them by false promises, he shews that nothing is to be expected from
   them, because by idle messages they will only protract the time.
   However that may be, from the neighboring nations to be mentioned in
   the next chapter, we may in part ascertain where they were situated,
   that is, not far from Egypt and Ethiopia: yet some may be disposed to
   view it as a description of that part of Ethiopia which lay on the
   sea-coast; for we shall afterwards see that the Assyrians were at war
   with the king of the Ethiopians. (Isaiah 37:9.)

   When he says that that land shadows with wings, we learn from it that
   its sea was well supplied with harbours, so that it had many vessels
   sailing to it and was wealthy; for small and poor states could not
   maintain intercourse or traffic with foreign countries. He therefore
   means that they performed many voyages.

   2. Sending ambassadors by the sea. This relates strictly to the state
   of those times. It would appear that this nation solicited the
   Egyptians or Syrians to harass the Jews, or that the Assyrians employed
   them for the purpose of harassing the Jews, or that they had formed an
   alliance with the Egyptians, in order that, by their united force, they
   might prevent the power of the Assyrians from increasing beyond bounds;
   for nothing more than conjectures can be offered, because we have no
   histories that give any account of it, and where historical evidence is
   wanting, we must resort to probable conjectures. These voyages, there
   is reason to believe, were not made to any place near at hand, but to a
   distant country.

   In ships of reeds. [13] We ought not to think it strange that he calls
   them ships of reeds, for it is evident from the ancient histories that
   these were commonly used by the Egyptians, because the channel of the
   Nile is in some places very steep and dangerous to navigators on
   account of the cataracts, which the Greeks call Katadoupa, so that
   ships of wood cannot be used at those places without being broken and
   dashed to pieces on the rocks; and therefore it is necessary to employ
   ships of pliant materials. That the ships might not admit water and
   thus be sunk, historians tell us that they were daubed within with
   pitch.

   Go, ye swift messengers. This passage is obscure, but I shall follow
   what I consider to be probable. The Prophet shews the design of his
   prediction, or the reason why he foretold the destruction of that
   nation. If we believe them to have been the avowed enemies of the Jews,
   the design was to afford some consolation to believers who were
   wretchedly broken up and scattered, that having received this message
   they might rejoice and give thanks to God. But if we rather think that
   the Jews were led by this nation into an unlawful league, we must then
   consider that this exhortation is ironical, and that the Prophet
   intended to reprove the folly of the chosen people, in forsaking God
   and relying on useless aid. Some think that these words were spoken by
   God, as if he commanded those nations who inhabited the sea-coast to
   destroy the Jews; but I am not at all of that opinion.

   To a nation scattered and plundered. [14] I do not agree with those who
   think that these words describe the destruction of that unknown and
   obscure nation; for by "a plundered nation" he means the Jews who were
   to be grievously harassed and scattered, so that no part of them
   escaped injury.

   To a people terrible from their beginning hitherto. He calls it
   terrible, because so great calamities would disfigure it in such a
   manner that all who beheld it would be struck with terror. I cannot
   approve of the exposition given by some, that this relates to the signs
   and miracles which the Lord performed amongst them, so as to render
   them an object of dread to all men; for the allusion is rather to that
   passage in the writings of Moses, "The Lord will make thee an
   astonishment and a terror." Deuteronomy 28:37 In like manner it is said
   elsewhere, "for the shaking of the head and mockery." (Jeremiah 18:16;
   19:8; 25:9, 13, 18.) He therefore means that they are a nation so
   dreadful to behold as to fill all men with astonishment, and we know
   that this was foretold and that it also happened to the Jews.

   A nation trodden down on every side. [15] qv qv, (kav-kav,) that is, on
   every side, as if one drew lines and joined them so closely that no
   space was left between them, or as if one drew furrows in a field so as
   to break every clod; for in this manner was the nation thrown down and
   trampled under foot. [16]

   Whose land the rivers have spoiled. By the rivers he means the vast
   army of the enemies, that is, of the Assyrians. He alludes to what he
   had formerly said, that the nation, not satisfied with its own little
   stream, longed for rapid and boisterous rivers. (Isaiah 8:6.) After
   having applied to them for assistance, they were overwhelmed by them as
   by a deluge; and the reason of the whole evil was this, that they were
   not satisfied with the promises of God, and sought assistance in
   another quarter. Now, if this command is understood to be given to the
   swift messengers in the name of God, we infer from it that he does not
   immediately assist his own people, but delays his aid till they are
   brought to a state of despair. He does not send to them a cheerful and
   prosperous message while they are still uninjured, or when they have
   received a light stroke, but he sends a message to a nation altogether
   trodden down and trampled under foot. Yet when he commands them to make
   haste, he means that the judgment will be sudden and unexpected, so
   that light will suddenly burst forth amidst the darkness.

   3. All ye inhabitants of the world. He shews that this work of God will
   be so manifestly excellent as to draw the attention not only of the
   Jews but of all nations.

   When he shall lift up an ensign on the mountains, you will see it. [17]
   These words, which are in the future tense, are rendered by some,
   agreeably to the custom of Scripture, in the imperative mood; [18] but
   it is better to view them as denoting what is future. It is as if he
   had said that the most distant nations will be witnesses of this
   destruction, because not only will the ensign be beheld by all, but the
   sound of the trumpets will be heard throughout the whole world. This
   will plainly shew that the war did not originate with men, but with God
   himself, who will prove himself to be the author of it by remarkable
   tokens. When wars are carried on, every one sees clearly what is done;
   but the greater part of men ascribe the beginning and end of them to
   chance. On the other hand, Isaiah shews that all these things ought to
   be ascribed to God, because he will display his power in a new and
   extraordinary manner; for sometimes he works so as to conceal his hand
   and to prevent his work from being perceived by men, but sometimes he
   displays his hand in such a manner that all are constrained to
   acknowledge it; and that is what the Prophet meant.

   4. But thus said Jehovah unto me. After having threatened a slaughter
   of the Ethiopians or their neighbors, and at the same time shewn that
   comfort will arise from it to the Jews, or ironically reproved the
   foolish confidence with which the Jews had been deceived, he now adds
   that God will regulate these confused changes in such a manner as to
   gather to him at length his chosen people. The particle ky, (ki,) which
   I have translated but, sometimes means for and sometimes but. The
   latter meaning appears to be more appropriate in this passage, for the
   Prophet replies to a doubt which otherwise might grievously perplex
   weak minds; because when confusion arises, there may be said to be a
   veil which conceals from us the providence of God. Such also was the
   state of that nation whose destruction he foretells, that this
   prediction might be reckoned fabulous and worthy of ridicule; for, as
   we may gather from it, there was no danger or change to be dreaded.

   I will rest. Some consider this as referring to the person of Isaiah,
   as if, relying on what God had revealed, he rested, that is, was in a
   state of composure, as we ought to be when we have heard the word of
   God, and fully expect what has been foretold. In like manner Habakkuk
   also says, On my watch-tower will I stand. (Habakkuk 2:1.) But
   unquestionably he relates what the Lord had foretold to him, and the
   Lord himself, by the mouth of the Prophet, makes this declaration, I
   will rest, that is, I will remain unemployed.

   And I will look in my tabernacle. [19] The phrase, I will look, has the
   same import with the former; for a spectator takes no part in doing,
   but rests satisfied with looking. Such is likewise the force of the
   term tabernacle, as if the Lord betook himself to rest under a roof;
   while, on the contrary, he says that he ascends the judgment-seat, when
   he avenges the transgressions of the wicked; for these modes of
   expression are adapted to our capacity. But perhaps it may be thought
   more probable that the Prophet alludes to the sanctuary; because,
   although the majesty of God will remain concealed for a time among an
   afflicted people, yet his rest will not be without effect. It amounts
   to this, that though everything be turned upside down, so as to awaken
   a suspicion that God takes no further concern in the government of the
   world, yet he rests for an express purpose, as if he shut himself up
   unemployed in a chamber, and the effect of this rest will in due time
   appear.

   As the heat that drieth up the rain. [20] By this beautiful metaphor
   the Prophet expresses more fully what he had formerly said. Yet there
   are two ways in which it may be shewn to agree with the Prophet's
   meaning; either that God, aroused, as it were, from his rest, will shew
   a smiling countenance to gladden believers, or will water them by a
   refreshing shower; and in this way the Prophet would describe their
   varied success. Or there is an implied contrast, by which he reminds us
   that, while God appears to remain unemployed and to look at what is
   going on, still he can execute his judgments as if it were in sport.
   And yet, as the two following verses are closely connected with this
   verse, Isaiah appears to mean, that though God does not act in a
   bustling manner like men, or proceed with undue eagerness and haste,
   still he has in his power concealed methods of executing his judgments
   without moving a finger. Perhaps also he intended to shew, that in
   destroying this nation, God will act in an extraordinary manner. But we
   ought to be satisfied with what I lately suggested, that when men
   carelessly resign themselves to sleep in the midst of prosperity, and,
   intoxicated by their pleasures, imagine that they have nothing to do
   with God, "sudden destruction is at hand," because God, by a look,
   frustrates all the designs or preparations of the world. (1
   Thessalonians 5:3.) He therefore declares that he will be like a clear
   and calm sky, [21] and like the heat that drieth up the rain.

   And as a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest. [22] Now we know that
   this rain is exceedingly adapted to ripen the fruits, and likewise that
   the heat which follows the rain penetrates the fruits with its force,
   and drives the moisture more inward, by which it hastens their maturity
   and renders them more productive. Now the Prophet meant, that though
   calamities and distresses await the reprobate, still everything
   proceeds so much to their wish, that they appear to be supremely happy,
   as if the Lord intended to load them with every kind of blessings; but
   that they are fattened like oxen destined for slaughter, for when they
   appear to have reached the highest happiness, they suddenly perish.

   Hence it follows, that we ought not to form an estimate of the
   judgments of God according to outward appearances; for when men imagine
   themselves to be exceedingly safe, they are not far from destruction
   and from utter ruin. Thus he speedily comforts believers, that they may
   not suppose that it fares better with the reprobate so long as God
   forbears to strike; for though he appears to cherish in his bosom those
   whom he sustains, he will quickly reduce them to nothing. These
   statements ought to be applied to those wretched and disastrous times
   when the tyrants who oppress the Church are the only persons that are
   prosperous, and abound in all kinds of wealth, and contrive in such a
   manner as if everything were in their power, because they surpass other
   men in power, and skill, and cunning. But let us know that all these
   things are done by the appointment of God, who promotes their endeavors
   and renders them successful, that he may at length slay and destroy
   them in a moment. I am aware that a widely different meaning is given
   by some to these words of the Prophet; but any one who takes a
   judicious view of the whole passage will have little difficulty, I
   trust, in assenting to my interpretation.

   5. For when the harvest shall be at hand. Literally it is, "in presence
   of the harvest;" but we must soften the harshness of the expressions;
   and it cannot be doubted that the meaning of the Prophet is, that when
   the harvest is close at hand, and when the grapes are nearly ripe, the
   whole produce, in the expectation of which wicked men had rejoiced,
   will suddenly be snatched from them. The Prophet continues the same
   subject, and confirms by these metaphors what he had formerly uttered,
   that the wicked are not immediately cut off, but flourish for a time,
   and the Lord spares them; but that when the harvest shall be at hand,
   when the vines shall put forth their buds and blossoms, so that the
   sour grapes make their appearance, the branches themselves shall be cut
   down. Thus when the wicked shall be nearly ripe, not only will they be
   deprived of their fruit, but they and their offspring shall be rooted
   out. Such is the end which the Lord will make to the wicked, after
   having permitted them for a time to enjoy prosperity; for they shall be
   rooted out, so that they cannot revive or spring up again in any way.

   Hence we obtain this great consolation, that when God conceals himself,
   he tries our faith, and does not suffer everything to be carried along
   by the blind violence of fortune, as heathens imagine; for God is in
   heaven, as in his tabernacle, dwelling in his Church as in a mean
   habitation; but at the proper season he will come forth. Let us thus
   enter into our consciences, and ponder everything, that we may sustain
   our minds by such a promise as this, which alone will enable us to
   overcome and subdue temptations. Let us also consider that the Lord
   declares that he advances and promotes the happiness of wicked men,
   which tends to exhibit and to display more illustriously the mercy of
   God. If he instantly cut down and took them away like a sprouting blade
   of corn, his power would not be so manifest, nor would his goodness be
   so fully ascertained as when he permits them to grow to a vast height,
   to swell and blossom, that they may afterwards fall by their own
   weight, or, like large and fat ears of corn, cuts them down with
   pruning-knives.

   6. They shall be left together. [23] He means that they will be cast
   aside as a thing of no value, as John the Baptist also compares them to
   chaff, which is thrown on the dunghill. (Matthew 3:12; Luke 3:17.) Thus
   Isaiah shews that they will be exposed to the wild beasts and to the
   fowls, so that the fowls will nestle in them in summer, and the wild
   beasts will make their lairs in them in winter; as if he had said, that
   not only men, but the wild beasts themselves will disdain them. Such
   therefore is the end of wicked men, who, situated in a lofty place, and
   thinking that they are beyond all danger, despise every one but
   themselves. The fowls and the beasts of prey will make use of them for
   nests and for food. They will be thrown down, I say, not only beneath
   all men, but even beneath the beasts themselves, and, being exposed to
   every kind of insult and dishonor, they will be a proof of the
   wonderful providence of God. [24]

   7. In that time. The Prophet again shews why he threatened the
   destruction of a heathen nation; for when almost all the nations had
   leagued together against the Church, it appeared as if the Church were
   utterly ruined, and therefore Jehovah declares that in due time he will
   render assistance. Had he not opposed such designs, and seasonably
   restrained the attacks of enemies, the Jews would have despaired; and
   on this account he shews that he takes care of the Church, and that
   though he determines to chastise it, still he comes forward at the
   proper season to hinder it from perishing, and displays his power in
   opposition to tyrants and other enemies, that they may not overthrow it
   or succeed in accomplishing what they imagined to be in their power. In
   order therefore to excite them to patience, he not only distinguishes
   them from the Ethiopians, but likewise reminds them that God mitigates
   his judgments for their preservation.

   A present shall be brought. He alludes to the second verse of this
   chapter, [Isaiah 18:2,] in which we have seen the same names and
   descriptions applied to the Jewish nation, and he employs the word
   brought because they would first of all be led into captivity, so that
   it would not be more practicable for them than for foreign nations to
   go up into the temple.

   From a people. This expression deserves notice, for mm, (mEgnam,) means
   that it will not be an entire nation; as if he had said, though you
   must be reduced to a small number, so as to be a feeble remnant, yet
   those few who are left will be offered in sacrifice to God. Hence we
   ought to learn a doctrine highly useful and exceedingly adapted to our
   times, for at the present day the Church is not far from despair, being
   plundered, scattered, and every where crushed and trodden under foot.
   What must be done in straits so numerous and so distressing? We ought
   to lay hold of these promises, so as to believe that still God will
   preserve the Church. To whatever extent the body may be torn, shivered
   into fragments and scattered, still by his Spirit he will easily unite
   the members, and will never allow the remembering and the calling on
   his name to perish. Out of those fragments which are now broken and
   scattered, the Lord will unite and assemble the people. Those whom he
   joins together in one spirit, though widely separated from each other,
   he can easily collect into one body. Although therefore we see the
   nation diminished in numbers, and some of its members cut off, yet some
   present will be offered by it to the Lord.

   To the place of the name. This mode of expression is customary with the
   prophets. When they speak of the worship of God they describe it by
   outward acts, such as altars, sacrifices, washings, and such like; and,
   indeed, the worship of God being within the soul, there is no way in
   which it can be described but by outward signs, by which men declare
   that they worship and adore God. But he chiefly calls it Mount Zion,
   because that place was consecrated to God, and God commanded that
   sacrifices should be offered there. The chief honor which he bestowed
   upon it was when he caused the doctrine of his word (Isaiah 2:3) to go
   forth from it, as we have formerly seen; [25] so that the name of Mount
   Zion may be properly understood to denote the pure and uncorrupted
   worship of God. In short, the prophets do not describe the worship of
   God as it would be after the coming of Christ, but as it was in their
   own time, because they found it necessary to accommodate themselves to
   the people to whom they ministered. Hence it ought to be inferred that
   there is no other way in which we can belong to the Church than by
   being offered to God in sacrifice. Let every one therefore who wishes
   to belong to God present himself for such an oblation, and let him no
   longer live to himself, but be wholly dedicated to God. (Romans 12:1; 2
   Corinthians 5:15.) Now we know that it is by this sword of the word,
   that is, by the gospel, that Paul boasts of offering and sacrificing
   men to God. (Romans 15:16.)

   By the place of the name of the Lord, he does not mean that his
   essence, of which we ought not to form any gross or earthly conception,
   is confined to it, as if God were limited to a place, but because it
   was a place in which the Lord commanded that his power should be
   acknowledged, and that men should worship and call upon him where he
   manifested his presence by his benefits and by his power, and that on
   account of the ignorance of the people, who could not otherwise
   comprehend his majesty. Yet it ought to be observed, that we cannot
   become acceptable to God without being united in one and the same
   faith, that is, without being members of the Church; for it is not
   necessary for us to run to Jerusalem, or to Mount Zion, because in the
   present day Zion is as wide and extensive as the whole world, which is
   entirely devoted to God. All that is necessary therefore is, that the
   same faith dwell in us, and that we be joined together by the bond of
   love. If this be wanting, every thing about us is heathen, and we have
   nothing that is sacred or holy.

   Isaiah Chapter 19:1-25

   1. The burden of Egypt. Behold, the Lord rideth upon a swift cloud, and
   shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his
   presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.

   1. Onus Ægypti. Ecce Iehova equitat super nubem celerem, et veniet in
   Ægyptum; et commovebuntur idola Ægypti a facie ejus, et cor Ægypti
   dissolvetur in medio ejus.

   2. And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall
   fight every one against his brother, and every one against his
   neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.

   2. Et committam Ægyptios cum Ægyptiis, pugnabit quisque tunc contra
   fratrem suum; quisque, inquam, contra proximum suum; civitas contra
   civitatem, et regnum contra regnum.

   3. And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will
   destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to
   the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the
   wizards.

   3. Et exinanietur spiritus Ægypti in medio ejus: et consilium ejus
   destruam, etiamsi quærant illod apud idola, apud magos, apud pythones,
   apud divinos.

   4. And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord;
   and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the Lord of
   hosts.

   4. Et tradam Ægyptios in manum domini sævi, et rex fortis dominabitur
   eis, dicit Dominus Iehova exercituum.

   5. And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be
   wasted and dried up.

   5. Tunc deficient aquæ a mari, et fluvius exsiccabitur atque arescet.

   6. And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of defence
   shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither.

   6. Elongabuntur flumina; exhaurientur et siccabuntur rivi munitionis,
   arundo et carectum succidentur.

   7. The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every
   thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no more

   7. Herbæ ad rivum et super os rivi, et omnis sementis rivi arescet, et
   propelletur, ut non sit.

   8. The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into the
   brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the water shall
   languish.

   8. Et moerebunt piscatores, et lugebunt omnes qui hamum projiciunt in
   rivum; qui expandunt rete super faciem aquarum debilitabuntur.

   9. Moreover, they that work in fine flax, and they that weave networks,
   shall be confounded.

   9. Qui in lino optimo operantur erubescent, et qui texunt plagas
   foratas, (vel, pellucidas.)

   10. And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make
   sluices and ponds for fish.

   10. Erunt enum retia ejus dissipata; et omnes architecti retis (vel,
   mercedis) tristes erunt anima.

   11. Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise
   counsellors of Paroaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Paraoh, I am
   the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?

   11. Certe stulti principes Zoan; prudentum consiliariorum Pharaonis
   consilium unfatuatum est. Quomodo dicitis Pharaoni, Filius sapientum
   ego, et filius regum antiquorum?

   12. Where are they? Where are thy wise men? And let them tell thee now,
   and let them know what the Lord of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt.

   12. Ubi nunc prudentes tui? ut annuntient tibi, aut etiam sciant quid
   decreverit Iehova exercituum super Ægyptum.

   13. The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are
   deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the stay of
   the tribes thereof.

   13. Infatuati sunt principes Zoan, decepti sunt principes Noph,
   seduxerunt Ægyptum angulus tribuum ejus.

   14. The Lord hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof; and
   they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunken man
   staggereth in his vomit.

   14. Iehova miscuit in medio ejus spiritum perversitatis; et seduxerunt
   Ægyptum in omni opere ejus, quemadmodum circumagitur ebrius in vomito
   suo.

   15. Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or tail,
   branch or rush, may do.

   15. Nec erit Ægypto opus quod faciat caput vel cauda, ramus aut juncus.

   16. In that day shall Egypt be like unto women; and it shall be afraid
   and fear, because of the shaking of the hand of the Lord of hosts,
   which he shaketh over it.

   16. In die illa erit Ægyptus instar mulierum; horrebit enim et pavebit
   a facie agitationis manus Iehovæ exercituum, quam agitabit ipse super
   eam.

   17. And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt; every one that
   maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the
   counsel of the Lord of hosts, which he hath determined against it.

   17. Et erit terra Iuda Ægyptiis in tremorem. Omnis qui recordatus
   fuerit illius pavebit super ipsam, propter consilium Iehovæ exercituum,
   quod decrevit super eam.

   18. In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the
   language of Canaan, and swear to the Lord of hosts: one shall be
   called, The city of destruction.

   18. In die illa erunt quinque civitates in terra Ægypti loquentes labio
   Canaan, et jurantes per Iehovam exercituum. Civitas desolationis una
   vocabitur.

   19. In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the
   land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the Lord.

   19. In die illa erit altare Iehovæ in medio terræ Ægypti, statua item
   juxta terminum ejus Iehovæ.

   20. And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord of hosts
   in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the Lord because of the
   oppressors, and he shall send them a savior, and a great one, and he
   shall deliver them.

   20. Eritque in signum et in testem Iehovæ exercituum, in terra Ægypti;
   quia clamabunt ad Iehovam propter oppressores, et mittet eis servatorem
   et principem, ut liberet eos.

   21. And the Lord shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know
   the Lord in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they
   shall vow a vow unto the Lord, and perform it

   21. Et cognoscetur Iehova ab Ægyptiis, cognoscent, inquam, Ægyptii
   Iehovam in illo die; et facient sacrificium et oblationem, vovebuntque
   vota Iehovæ et reddent.

   22. And the Lord shall smite Egypt; he shall smite and heal it: and
   they shall return even to the Lord, and he shall be entreated of them,
   and shall heal them.

   22. Itaque percutiet Iehova Ægyptum, percutiens et sanans; convertentur
   enim ad Iehovam, et exorabitur ab eis, et sanabit eos.

   23. In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and
   the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and
   the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.

   23. In die illa erit via ab Ægypto in Assyriam; commeabunt Assyrii in
   Ægyptum, et Ægyptii in Assyriam; et colent Ægyptii Assyrios (vel, cum
   Assyriis.)

   24. In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria,
   even a blessing in the midst of the land:

   24. In die illa erit Israel tertia cum Ægypto, et Assyria benedictio in
   medio terræ.

   25. Whom the Lord of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt my
   people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.

   25. Quia benedicet illi Iehova exercituum, dicens: Benedictus populus
   meus Ægyptius, et opus manus meæ Assyrius, et hæreditas mea Israel.


   l. The burden of Egypt. The Prophet here prophesies against Egypt,
   because it was a kind of refuge to the Jews, whenever they saw any
   danger approaching them; for when they had forsaken God, to whom they
   ought to have had recourse, they thought that they had no help left to
   them but in the Egyptians. It was therefore necessary that that kingdom
   should be overthrown, that its wealth or its forces might no longer
   deceive the Jews; for so long as Egypt was prosperous, the Jews thought
   that, on account of its being exceedingly populous and highly
   fortified, they were far removed from danger, and therefore despised
   God, or at least paid scarcely any regard to his promises. This led to
   evil consequences in two respects; first, because when they ought to
   have relied on God alone, they were puffed up with that vain confidence
   in Egypt; and secondly, because whenever the Lord punished them, they
   defended themselves against his chastisements by the power of the
   Egyptians, as if by human resources they could make void his judgments,
   when they ought to have been turned to God altogether. On this subject
   Isaiah speaks more fully in a later portion of this book. (Isaiah
   30:2.)

   Behold, the Lord rideth on a swift cloud. This mode of expression is
   found also in other passages of Scripture, but in a general form.
   (Psalm 104:3.) The Prophet applies it to this prediction, because the
   Egyptians thought that they were so well fortified on all sides, that
   there was no way by which God could approach them. He therefore
   ridicules their foolish confidence, and exhibits the exalted power of
   God, when he rideth on a swift cloud, by which he will easily make a
   descent upon them, and neither walls nor bulwarks shall hinder his
   progress. Again, because in addition to earthly aid the Jews were
   likewise bewitched by a false religion, on this ground also the Prophet
   ridicules their madness, because God will dash to the ground all the
   assistance which they expected to obtain from idols. I pass by the
   foolish notion which many have entertained, as to the idols which
   Christ overthrew in Egypt, when he was carried thither in infancy; for
   it does not deserve a refutation. (Matthew 2:14.) This passage has been
   perverted to prove it, and to prove many conjectures of the same kind.
   But the Prophet's meaning is totally different; for he speaks of the
   defeat of the Egyptians by the Assyrians, and shews that it ought to be
   ascribed to God, and not, as irreligious men commonly do, to fortune.
   He shews it to be a judgment of God, by whose hand all things are
   governed.

   And the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence. He declares that
   the idols shall fall; that is, that they shall be of no avail to the
   Egyptians, though they rely on their assistance, and think that they
   are under their protection. No nation ever was so much addicted to
   superstitions; for they worshipped cats, and oxen, and crocodiles, and
   even onions, and plants of every sort, and there was nothing to which
   they did not ascribe some kind of divinity. He means that the power of
   all those false gods, whom the Egyptians had taken for their
   protectors, will be overthrown. Having declared that the Egyptians rely
   in vain on their superstitions, he likewise casts down the pride which
   they cherished as to their earthly resources.

   And the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of her. By the word
   heart he means the courage which sometimes fails even the bravest men,
   so that they do not attempt any action, even when their strength and
   forces are abundant, and in this manner he declares that they will be
   at war with God, who will melt their hearts within them, before they
   are called to contend with their enemies. Not only does he threaten
   that they will be terrified, but he likewise adds in the midst of the
   whole kingdom, where they had an exceedingly safe and peaceful
   dwelling, because they were far removed from every attack. It was the
   duty of all believers to consider this, when war was waged against the
   Egyptians; and we also ought to behold the same thing exemplified in
   all revolutions of kingdoms, which proceed solely from the hand of God.
   If the heart melts, if the strength fails, in men who are usually
   brave, and who had formerly displayed great courage, this ought to be
   ascribed to the vengeance of God.

   2. And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians. Here he
   describes more particularly the calamity which the Lord had determined
   to bring on Egypt. By the expression, I will set, he means the internal
   struggles, in which those who ought to be mutual defenders cut down one
   another; and no evil can be more destructive than this to a state or a
   people. It was of importance also to convince the Jews that God, in
   whose hands are the hearts of men, (Proverbs 21:1,) could by his unseen
   influence inflame the Jews to mutual animosities, that they might slay
   each other, though they were victorious over foreign enemies. Hence we
   learn that nations never rise in a seditious manner, unless the Lord
   set them against each other, as when one brings forward gladiators to
   the place of combat. He inflames their minds for battle, and prompts
   them to slay each other by mutual wounds; and therefore, as we ought to
   reckon it an evidence of God's favor, when friendship is cherished
   among citizens, so we ought to ascribe it to his vengeance, when they
   rage against and slay and injure one another.

   And they shall fight every one against his brother. For the sake of
   heightening the picture, he adds what was still more monstrous, that
   those who were related to them by blood would take up arms to destroy
   each other; for if men are worse than beasts when, forgetting their
   common nature, they engage in battle, how much more shocking is it to
   nature that brethren or allies should fight with each other! But the
   more monstrous it is, the more ought we to acknowledge the judgment of
   God and his terrible vengeance.

   City against city, and kingdom against kingdom. Isaiah appears to
   advance by degrees; for he mentions, first, a brother; secondly, a
   neighbor; thirdly, cities; and, fourthly, kingdoms By kingdoms he means
   provinces, into which Egypt was divided, which the Greeks called nomoi,
   the term by which the Greek translators have rendered it in this
   passage. [26]

   3. And the spirit of Egypt shall be emptied. [27] As Isaiah had, a
   little before, deprived the Egyptians of courage, so he now takes away
   their understanding, both of which are exceedingly necessary for the
   defense of kingdoms; for when these have been taken away, there is no
   possibility of transacting national affairs. Now, the Egyptians had so
   high an opinion of their own wisdom, that they reckoned themselves
   superior to other nations; and it is well known that they haughtily
   despised all other nations as barbarians, as if there had been no
   civilization, refinement, learning, or skill, but in Egypt alone. They
   boasted that they were the inventors of learning, that philosophy and
   astronomy came from them, and, in short, that Egypt was the workshop of
   all the liberal arts; and therefore they would never have thought it
   possible that they should fail in wisdom and prudence, and
   unquestionably, if this prediction had come to their knowledge, they
   would have laughed at it in disdain, and would have thought, that
   sooner would the waters of the sea be dried up, and everything be
   overturned, than this should befall those who imagined that prudence
   was their birthright. But Isaiah declares it boldly, for he did not
   speak from himself.

   Again, since he had predicted that they would be deprived of courage,
   in which they excelled, the context requires us to understand the
   meaning to be, that they would be struck with blindness; for both
   faculties of the soul depend entirely on the favor of God.
   Consequently, rvch (ruach) means here understanding and sagacity, which
   ought to be carefully observed, for many are mistaken as to the meaning
   of this word. When he immediately adds, I will destroy the counsel
   thereof, this is a stronger expression of the former statement; for it
   shews what is the cause of that emptiness, namely, that God will take
   and carry away their counsel.

   Even though they seek it. This is spoken by anticipation, for he meets
   the objections of the Egyptians, who might have said, "Have we not gods
   whom we can consult? Have we not magicians, diviners, and soothsayers?
   Do you reckon those to be of no value?" He threatens that all these
   things will be of no avail to them, to whatever extent they may rely on
   them, and be puffed up with the empty name of wisdom. I shall not spend
   much time on these names, though it is probable that Isaiah's
   enumeration proceeds by gradual advancement. First, he mentions gods,
   next magicians, and afterwards diviners and fortune-tellers They had
   their oracles, in which they placed the highest confidence. Next after
   them came the magicians, though these too had great influence. In
   matters of smaller moment they consulted the soothsayers. Superstitious
   men are so restless that nothing can satisfy them; for they are fickle
   and unsteady, and sometimes resort to one remedy and sometimes to
   another; and indeed Satan deceives them in such a manner, that at first
   he holds out to them the appearance of peace and quietness, which they
   think that they have fully obtained, but afterwards shews them that
   they have not reached it, and distresses and harasses them more and
   more, and compels them to seek new grounds of confidence. Thus our
   minds cannot obtain rest and peace but in God alone. And undoubtedly
   the Prophet condemns those arts as contrary to reason; for God has
   revealed all that is necessary to be known by means of the arts and
   sciences, which he intended to be used, and of which he approves. If
   any man shall wish to be wise in any other manner, he must have Satan
   for his teacher.

   4. And I will deliver the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel master.
   [28] He now shews what will happen to the Egyptians, after having lost
   courage and been deprived of understanding. Nothing will be left for
   them but to be reduced to slavery; for a nation destitute of these must
   fall of its own accord, even though it were not violently attacked by
   any enemy. Of such aids, therefore, God deprives those on whom he
   determines to take vengeance, and shuts them out from every method of
   upholding their liberty. Yet the Prophet threatens what is still more
   shocking, that not only will the empire of which the Egyptians proudly
   vaunted fall down, but the inhabitants also will undergo hard bondage.
   Though the adjective qsh, (kashEh,) cruel, is in the singular number,
   yet he says in the plural number, that they shall be subject to lords,
   which is harder to endure than if there had been but one lord to whom
   they were subject.

   And a powerful king [29] shall rule over them. He means that the power
   of the tyrant to whom he will subject them shall be so great, that it
   will not be easy to restore them to liberty. Historians shew that
   various changes occurred in many countries, which they who subdued them
   were unable to hold and retain; for to keep what has been obtained is
   often more difficult than to conquer. But the Prophet intimates that
   this condition will not be easily changed, and that the bondage of the
   Egyptians shall be of long duration, because no one will dare to enter
   the lists with an exceedingly powerful conqueror. We may also
   understand the meaning to be, that the princes of smaller nations will
   deal more gently with their people than more powerful monarchs, who,
   relying on their greatness, allow themselves to do whatever they
   please; for, reckoning their power to be unlimited, they set no bounds
   to their freedom of action, and rush forward, without restraint,
   wherever their passions drive them. Whether the one view or the other
   be adopted, it will amount to this, that the Egyptians, who consider
   themselves to be the highest and most distinguished of all men, shall
   fall under the power of another, and shall be oppressed by hard
   bondage, that is, by the bondage of a powerful king, whom no one will
   dare to oppose. Hence we see how great is the folly of men who are
   desirous to have a powerful and wealthy king reigning over them, and
   how justly they are punished for their ambition, though it cannot be
   corrected by the experience of every day, which is everywhere to be
   seen in the world. France and Spain, at the present day, boast that
   they are governed by mighty princes, but feel to their cost how little
   advantage they derive from that which dazzles them by a false pretense
   of honor. But on this subject we have spoken formerly in another place.
   [30] (Isaiah 8:6,7.)

   5. Then the waters shall fail from the sea. He follows out the subject
   which he had already begun, that the fortifications, by which the
   Egyptians thought that they were admirably defended, will be of no
   avail to them. They reckoned themselves to be invincible, because they
   were surrounded by the sea, and by the Nile, and by fortifications; and
   historians tell us that it was difficult to gain entrance to them,
   because the Nile had no mouth, by which they could not easily prevent
   ships from landing. They therefore boasted that their situation was
   excellent, and that they were strongly fortified by nature, in like
   manner as the inhabitants of Venice, at the present day, think that, in
   consequence of being surrounded by deep ditches, they are impregnable;
   but fortresses are useless, when God has determined to punish us.

   6. And the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up. [31] What
   he adds about fortifications is to the same purpose with what he had
   stated immediately before. He alludes to the embankments, which not
   only restrained the overflowing of the Nile, but protected the whole
   country; as if he had said that the embankments will not be needed,
   because the Nile will be dried up. Now, it is certain that the Nile was
   not laid dry, and yet the Prophet did not foretell what was not
   accomplished. We must therefore call to remembrance what we have
   already said, that on account of our stupidity those calamities are
   represented to us in a lively manner, which places them as it were
   before our eyes; for we need to have a representation made to us which
   is fitted to impress our minds, and to arouse us to consider the
   judgments of God, which otherwise we despise. We ought to observe the
   haughtiness of the Egyptians, whose resources were so various and
   abundant, and who thought that it was impossible for them to be
   overtaken by such a calamity.

   7. And the reed and the rush shall wither. He mentions the reed and the
   rush, because they had abundance of them, and employed them for various
   purposes; or, it may be thought to mean that the marshes will be dried
   up.

   By the mouth of the brooks. Some render it embankments, but it rather
   means the fountain itself, which seldom is dried up, though torrents or
   rivers fail. By the mouth, therefore, he means the source of the river
   which shall be dried up in such a manner that no part of the country
   can be watered. Though the source of the Nile was at a great distance,
   yet not without reason did the Prophet threaten that that river, on
   whose waters the fertility almost of the whole land depended, shall be
   dried up at its very source; for in that country rain seldom falls, but
   its place is supplied every year by the Nile. If that river overflow
   but scantily, it threatens scarcity and famine; and therefore, when the
   Prophet threatens that it will be dried up, he means that the whole
   country will be barren. For this reason he says also, that, even at its
   very mouth, from which the waters spring up, there will be a lack of
   waters, so that in that place the herbs will be withered.

   8. And the fishers shall mourn. Isaiah still keeps in his eye the
   condition of Egypt. We have formerly mentioned [32] that the prophets
   made use of those figures of speech by which, when any country is
   mentioned, they chiefly name those things which abound in that country,
   and for which it is celebrated. Thus, when a vinebearing country is
   spoken of, they mention vines; if it abound in gold, they speak of
   gold; and if it abound in silver, they speak of silver. Accordingly,
   when he speaks of Egypt, which was well watered, and contained
   abundance of streams, he mentions fishing.

   They who spread a net on the face of the waters shall languish. Some
   translate the word 'mllv, (amlalu,) "they shall be cut off," but the
   more correct rendering is, "they shall be weakened;" for this
   corresponds to the mourning and lamentation which was formerly
   mentioned. Now, we know that in that country there was a great number
   of fishers, and that these formed a great part of the wealth of Egypt.
   When fishers were taken away, of whom there were vast numbers among the
   Egyptians, and of whom their wealth chiefly consisted, they must have
   been weakened. Now, if the nation be deprived of that which is its
   ordinary food, great poverty will follow. He therefore describes an
   astonishing change that shall pass on the whole country.

   9. And they who work in the finest flax. As he spoke of mourning, so he
   now speaks of shame; for they who formerly earned an abundant
   livelihood by this trade will have no gains. Now, the two occupations
   are closely connected, to weave nets and to fish. Yet it is doubtful if
   he speaks of those only who manufactured nets; for if we understand
   sryqvt, (sErikOth) to mean certain very fine linens, it is probable
   that the latter clause relates to other productions of the loom,
   manufactured out of small fine thread, and of the most elegant
   workmanship. We know that linens of very great value were woven in
   Egypt, and there may be good reason for interpreting the phrase white
   nets, or, as we have rendered it, "perforated," to mean also linen
   garments, which were more costly in proportion to the greater delicacy
   of their texture.

   It will thus be a metaphorical expression, by which the Prophet
   indirectly taunts them with their unbecoming luxury, alleging that the
   Egyptians cover themselves with linen garments in the same manner as if
   they clothed themselves with a net. If this meaning be adopted, it will
   agree with the following verse; and indeed I do not see how such
   exquisite skill in weaving can be applied to fishing. But if it be
   thought better to understand the whole as relating to fishes, the
   meaning will be, that they who had been much employed in fishing, and
   had found it to be a profitable occupation, will be overwhelmed with
   sorrow. [33]

   10. And all that make ponds. As to the word skr, (secher,) there is no
   absolute necessity, in my opinion, for translating it a net; for the
   derivation shews it, on the contrary, to denote a lucrative occupation.
   [34]

   Where fishes are very abundant, they are also preserved in pools and
   ponds; because the fishers would otherwise be constrained to sell them
   at a very low price. Besides, when they throw a net, they are not
   always successful. He therefore follows out the same subject, "It will
   not be possible either to take or to preserve fishes. Pools will be of
   no use."

   11. Surely the princes of Zoan are fools. Here he joins wisdom with
   folly, and not without reason; for it is impossible to take away from
   men a conviction of their wisdom, which leads them to believe, in
   opposition to God himself, that they are wise. It is therefore a kind
   of acknowledgment, when he calls those persons wise whom he at the same
   time accuses of folly or stupidity. Though the Hebrew particle 'k,
   (ach,) sometimes means but, yet as the Prophet appears to attack the
   Egyptians, I choose rather to render it "surely," or "truly," or "now
   at least;" for he scoffs at the counselors of Pharaoh for wishing to be
   regarded, and believing themselves to be, exceeding wise, though they
   are the most foolish of all men. Thus it is an exclamation: "Where is
   that wisdom of Egypt? Where are the counselors who held all men in
   contempt? Why do they not preserve their kingdom?" Now, at least, it is
   evident what kind of wisdom they had. This tends to confirm and seal
   the prophecy, in which the Prophet obviously does not speak of things
   unknown, but has before his eyes, as it were, the destruction of Egypt.
   "Armed therefore with the authority of God, I venture to pronounce all
   those princes to be fools, though they think that they are wise."

   Finally, the Prophet shews that vain is the glory of men who, without
   God, claim for themselves even a spark of wisdom; because their folly
   is at length exposed, and when the actual trial comes, they shew that
   they are children. The Lord permits them, indeed, to achieve many
   exploits, that they may obtain reputation among men, but in the end he
   infatuates them, so that, notwithstanding their sagacity and long
   experience, they act more foolishly than children. Let us therefore
   learn to seek from the Lord the spirit of wisdom and counsel, and if he
   shall bestow it upon us, let us use it with propriety and moderation;
   for God opposes the wisdom of men when they claim more than they have a
   right to claim, and those who are too ambitious to exalt themselves,
   must be punished for their folly; and therefore he often puts them to
   shame, that it may be made manifest that their wisdom is nothing but
   empty smoke. There is no wisdom but that which is founded on the fear
   of God, which Solomon also declares to be the chief part of wisdom.
   (Proverbs 1:7; 9:10.)

   How say ye to Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient
   kings? He reproves the counsellors of Pharaoh for flattering him, as
   courtiers are wont to flatter princes; for they utter nothing but what
   is intended to soothe and gratify the ears of princes, because this is
   the way by which they succeed and obtain favor. Thus, amidst many
   flatteries and lies, there is no room for truth. Though this vice is
   commonly found in the courts of great princes, yet at that time it
   abounded chiefly among the Egyptians. They boasted that they were the
   most ancient of all nations, and that they were the inventors of the
   arts, and of all liberal education; and if such a conviction existed
   even among the common people, how much stronger must it have been in
   the kings themselves?

   The boasting related to two points, antiquity and knowledge; and Isaiah
   reproves both, or at least says that they will be of no value. Pharaoh
   boasted both of the antiquity and of the wisdom of his nation; and
   indeed this was common among the whole people; but he speaks chiefly of
   the king as the head, in whom this haughtiness was more conspicuous
   than among ordinary persons. Now, we ought not to boast of the wisdom
   of our ancestors, as if it belonged to us by hereditary right, but we
   must look to heaven and ask it from its Author. So far as relates to
   antiquity, it is a foolish and idle boast; and yet princes are so
   deeply infected by this vice, that they would willingly seek their
   birth and descent out of the world, and cannot easily be drawn away
   from that vanity. This madness is heightened by flatterers, who have
   contrived, as we perceive, many things about the genealogy of certain
   princes. No song is more delightful to them than when they are
   separated from the common herd of men, like demigods or heroes. But it
   frequently happens, that when they carry their curiosity to excess in
   inquiring about their grandfathers and great-grandfathers, they lay
   themselves open to ridicule, because it is found that they are
   descended from one of the common people.

   I have heard an amusing anecdote, related by persons worthy of credit,
   about the Emperor Maximilian, who was very eager to inquire into his
   descent, and was induced by a silly trifler to believe that he had
   traced his lineage to Noah's ark. This subject made so powerful an
   impression on his mind, that he left off all business, applied himself
   earnestly to this single investigation, and would allow no one to draw
   him away from it, not even the ambassadors who came to treat with him
   about important matters. All were astonished at this folly, and
   silently blamed him for it, but no one had power or courage to suggest
   a remedy. At length his cook, who was likewise his jester, and often
   entertained him with his sayings, asked leave to speak, and, as one who
   was desirous to uphold the Emperor's dignity, told him that this
   eagerness to trace his descent would neither be useful nor honorable;
   for, said he, at present I revere your majesty, and worship you as a
   god; but if we must come to Noah's ark, there we shall all be cousins,
   for we are all descended from it. Maximilian was so deeply affected by
   this saying of the jester, that he became ashamed of his undertaking,
   though formerly neither friends, nor counsellors, nor business could
   dissuade him from it; for he perceived that his name which he wished to
   render more illustrious by inquiring into his remote ancestors, would
   be altogether degraded if they came to its earliest source, from which
   princes and peasants, nobles and artisans, are descended.

   What is blamed even by jesters and fools must be great madness; and yet
   it is not a vice which has lately sprung up, but is deeply rooted in
   the minds of almost all men. In order to avoid it, let us learn to
   depend on God alone, and let us prefer the blessedness of adoption to
   all riches, and lineage, and nobility. So far as relates to the kings
   of Egypt being descended from very ancient kings, who had kept
   possession of the throne for many ages, they were as proud as if wisdom
   had been born with them. [35]

   12. Where are thy wise men? that they may tell thee. Though literally
   it runs thus, "And they shall tell thee, and shall know," yet the word
   ought to be regarded as meaning, "that they may tell thee, and even
   that at length they may know;" for this mode of expression is
   frequently employed by the Hebrews. The Egyptians had their diviners
   from whom they thought that nothing, however secret, was concealed; for
   they consulted them about the smallest and greatest affairs, and held
   their replies to be oracles. The Prophet, mocking that vanity, says,
   "How shall they tell what they do not know? Have they been admitted to
   the counsel of God?" It is also probable that he condemns the art which
   they used in divination, because it was not only unlawful, but also
   made use of absolute tricks and deceptions.

   There are three ways in which we may foresee or know what is future.
   The first and chief way is, by the revelation of the Spirit, which
   alone can make us certain, as by the gift of prophecy, which is rare
   and uncommon. The second is, by astronomy. The third is, by a
   comparison of past events, from which prudence is commonly obtained

   As to a knowledge of the stars, from their position and conjunction,
   some things may occasionally be learned, such as famine, scarcity,
   pestilence, abundant harvests, and things of that sort; but even these
   cannot be certain, for they rest on mere conjecture. Now, we ought
   always to consider what relation the stars bear to these lower regions;
   for the actions of men are not regulated by them, as idle and false
   astrologers imagine, a vast number of whom, at the present day,
   endeavor to insinuate themselves into the minds of princes and
   subjects, as if they possessed a knowledge of everything, both present
   and future. Such men resemble the impostors of whom the Prophet speaks,
   who deceive men by their jugglery. Yet princes lend an attentive ear to
   such persons, and receive them as gods; and indeed they deserve to be
   thus imposed upon, and are justly punished for their curiosity.

   They likewise boast of magic, in which those Egyptian diviners were
   skilled. But they add many things which are worse, and more abominable,
   exorcisms and calling on devils, than which nothing more destructive
   can be expressed or conceived. The Lord pronounces a curse on such
   conjectures and arts of divination, and the issue of them cannot but be
   disastrous and wretched. And if they were formerly condemned in the
   Egyptians, how much more do they deserve condemnation in those who use
   the name of God as a pretext? It is wonderful that men otherwise acute
   and sagacious should be so childishly deceived by such jugglery, so
   that they appear to be deprived of understanding and judgment; but it
   is the Lord's righteous vengeance, who punishes the wickedness of men.

   Again, when from past events we calculate what is future, and judge by
   experience and observation what is most proper to be done, that cannot
   in itself be blamed; but neither can we by these means learn with
   certainty what is future, for the matter always lies in conjecture. Yet
   Isaiah directly attacks that sagacity which is universally applauded as
   something highly excellent, not because it is in itself sinful, but
   because we can scarcely find an acute or ingenious person who does not
   confidently believe that his skill places within his reach all that
   deserves or is necessary to be known. In this manner they despise the
   secret providence of God, as if nothing were hidden from them.

   What the Lord of hosts hath decreed. There is still another vice, that
   craftiness and sleight of hand are preferred by them to true wisdom.
   But Isaiah expressly censures that pride which led men endued with
   great abilities to measure events by their own judgment, as if the
   government of the world were not in the hand of God; and therefore with
   their divination he contrasts the heavenly decree. And hence learn how
   skillfully Isocrates says,

   "Kratiston einai para men theou eutuchian, para de hemon auton
   euboulian,
   "that the best gift of God is success, and the best gift from ourselves
   is prudence."

   At first sight, this maxim of the elegant orator appears beautiful; but
   since he robs God of the spirit of prudence and bestows it on mortals,
   the distribution is both wicked and foolish, to ascribe to men sound
   counsel, and to leave nothing to God but prosperous fortune. Now, if
   any one neglect the methods by which God teaches us, and resort to
   Satan's impostures, he richly deserves to be deceived and involved in
   the greatest disgrace; for he seeks remedies that are nowhere to be
   found, and despises those which were offered by God.

   13. The princes of Zoan are become infatuated, the princes of Noph are
   deceived. Zoan was one of the chief cities of Egypt; Noph also was
   highly celebrated; [36] but what cities they were we cannot with
   certainty determine. Some think that one of them was Alexandria, the
   antiquity and wealth of which may be inferred from many passages of
   Scripture, which serve also to refute the notion of those who think
   that it was founded by Alexander the Great; for although it had been
   frequently destroyed, yet he did not build it anew, but only repaired
   it. That at one time it was an independent state, and allied to the
   Egyptians, and that it was one of the most flourishing cities in the
   whole world, is evident from Nahum 3:8. The Prophet justly represents
   the stupidity of the princes to be the forerunner of its destruction;
   because the chief strength of any commonwealth or kingdom consists in
   wisdom and prudence, without which neither great riches nor a numerous
   population can be of any avail.

   A corner of its tribes have deceived Egypt. [37] I consider the word
   corner to be here used metaphorically for the chief part of a building
   on which the whole weight rests; and I choose rather to view it in the
   nominative than in the accusative case. [38] It ought, I think, to be
   viewed as referring to those wise men by whom the Egyptians supposed
   themselves to be so powerfully defended that no evil could befall them.
   But Isaiah says that this is too feeble a support, because, having been
   deceived in their counsels, they ruined Egypt; and therefore he holds
   up to mockery that pretended wisdom which, when it is not accompanied
   by the fear of God, ought to be called vanity and folly, and not
   wisdom. Not only do men abuse an excellent gift of God, but they are
   puffed up with vain ambition, and are more delighted with cunning than
   with real prudence. To this is added a devilish fury, which leads them
   to disregard the providence of God, and to bring down all events to the
   level of their own capacity. This is the reason why Scripture so
   frequently attacks wise men of that description, and declares that they
   are fools. They usurp what belongs to God, and claim it for themselves;
   which is shocking and intolerable sacrilege. We need not wonder if the
   Lord make fearful displays against such wise men, so that with all
   their great acuteness and ingenuity they stumble and fall in the
   smallest matters, and run into great dangers which any peasant or
   artisan would have foreseen. Let these things be a warning to us, that
   we may not be elated or lay claim to the praise of wisdom. If we have
   any abilities or prudence, we ought to ascribe it wholly to God, and
   conform ourselves to the rule of sobriety and modesty; for if our
   wisdom rest on God he will truly be a steadfast corner-stone, which no
   one shall shake or overthrow.

   14. The Lord hath mingled a spirit of perverseness. Because it was a
   thing unexpected and incredible that the leaders of a sagacious and
   prudent nation would destroy the country by their stupidity, the
   Prophet therefore ascribes it to the judgment of God, that the Jews may
   not shut their eyes against an example so striking and remarkable, as
   irreligious men usually attribute the judgments of God to chance when
   anything new or unexpected has happened. The expression is
   metaphorical, as if one were to mix wine in a cup, that the Lord thus
   intoxicates the wise men of this world so that they are stunned and
   amazed, and can neither think nor act aright. The consequence is, that
   they deceive Egypt, because, first, they were themselves deceived. That
   the Egyptians suffer themselves to be imposed on, and cannot guard
   against the deception, is the judgment of the Lord.

   And yet Isaiah does not represent God to be the Author of this folly in
   such a manner that the Egyptians could impute blame to him, but we
   ought to view the matter in this light: "Men have in themselves no
   understanding or judgment, for whence comes wisdom but from the Spirit
   of God, who is the only fountain of light, understanding, and truth?
   Now, if the Lord withhold his Spirit from us, what right have we to
   dispute with him? He is under no obligations to us, and all that he
   bestows is actually a free gift." Yet when he strikes the minds of men
   with a spirit of giddiness, he does it always for good reasons, though
   they are sometimes concealed from us. But very frequently he punishes
   with blindness those wicked men who have risen up against him, as
   happened to those Egyptians who, puffed up with a conviction of their
   wisdom, swelled with pride and despised all other men. It is therefore
   superfluous to dispute here about predestination, for the Lord punishes
   them for open vice; and, accordingly, when God blinds men or gives them
   over to a reprobate mind, (Romans 1:28,) he cannot be accused of
   cruelty; for it is the just punishment of their wickedness and
   licentiousness, and he who acts justly in punishing transgressions
   cannot be called the Author of sin.

   Let us now attend to the manner of punishing. He delivers them up to
   Satan to be punished; for he it is, strictly speaking, that mingles the
   spirit of giddiness and perverseness; but as he does nothing but by the
   command of God, it is therefore said that God does what Satan does. The
   statement commonly made, that it is done by God's permission, is an
   excessively frivolous evasion; for the Prophet has expressed more than
   this, namely, that this punishment was inflicted by God, because he is
   a righteous judge. God therefore acts by means of Satan, as a judge by
   means of an executioner, and inflicts righteous punishment on those who
   have offended him. Thus in the book of Kings we read that Satan
   presented himself before God, and asked leave to deceive Ahab's
   prophets; and having obtained it, he then obeyed the command of God,
   for he could have done nothing by himself. It is unnecessary to produce
   a multitude of quotations in a matter so obvious.

   And they have misled Egypt in all her work. When he adds that her
   counsellors deceived her, he points out a second judgment of God; for
   it might have happened that the princes were deprived of understanding,
   and resembled drunkards, and yet the common people continued to possess
   some judgment; but here he says, that the impostors obtained also the
   power of leading astray so as to deceive the people. This is a two-fold
   vengeance of God, both on them that lead astray, and on those who are
   led astray by them.

   As a drunken man staggereth in his vomit. By a vomit He means shameful
   drunkenness. This is added (pros auxesin) by way of amplification, in
   order to shew that they were not ordinary drunkards, who have still
   some understanding left, but that they resembled swine.

   15. Neither shall Egypt have any work to do. This is the conclusion of
   the former statement, for it means that all the Egyptians shall be
   stupefied to such a degree that whatever they undertake shall be
   fruitless. This must happen where there is no counsel, and it is the
   righteous punishment of our pride and rashness. He therefore intended
   to describe the result and effect, so as to shew that it will be
   unhappy and miserable.

   Head or tail, branch or rush. When he threatens both the head and the
   tail, he means, that all ranks, from the highest to the lowest, all
   without exception, shall be deprived of counsel, so that they will not
   succeed in anything. Or perhaps it will be thought rather to mean the
   order which they observe in their actions. Hence we learn, that both
   the beginning and the end of everything depend on God; for we ought to
   ask from him counsel, and prudence, and success, if we do not wish that
   the same thing should happen to us which happened to the Egyptians.

   16. In that day shall Egypt be like women. He again repeats what he had
   formerly said, that the Egyptians will have nothing that is manly. Some
   think that he alludes to an effeminate custom, on account of which the
   ancient historians censured the Egyptians, namely, that, by inverting
   the order of things, women appeared in public and transacted the
   affairs of state, and men performed the occupations of women. It is
   possible that the Prophet may have had this in his eye, but when I take
   a more careful view of the whole passage, this conjecture cannot be
   admitted; for here he threatens a judgment of God, which will hold up
   men to astonishment. If he were speaking of an ordinary custom, this
   would not apply to the matter in hand, for he does not charge the
   hearts of the Egyptians with being effeminate, but, on the contrary,
   threatens that they shall be struck with such dread that in no respect
   will they differ from women. The Egyptians not only thought that they
   were able to maintain war, but attacked without provocation, and gave
   aid to other nations. We see that heathen writers relate many of the
   exploits of the Egyptians, and expatiate largely on their praises; and,
   therefore, although the Egyptians were feeble and effeminate in
   comparison with other nations, yet they wished to retain the praise and
   renown of warlike men.

   Because of the shaking of the hand of Jehovah of hosts. [39] The sudden
   change which is now effected is a striking display of the judgment of
   heaven, and therefore he adds, that the shaking of the hand of God will
   be the cause of the terror. By these words he shews that this war will
   be entirely carried on by the Lord, and therefore that the Egyptians
   cannot stand against it, because they have not to do with men. What
   Isaiah declares concerning Egypt ought to be likewise applied to other
   nations; for if wars arise and insurrections spring up, we ought to
   acknowledge it to be a judgment of God when men lose courage and are
   overwhelmed with terror. We see how the most warlike nations give way,
   and shew themselves to be less courageous than women, and are
   vanquished without any preparations of war, whenever the Lord strikes
   their minds with dread.

   17. And the land of Judah shall be a terror to the Egyptians. Some
   explain it simply to mean, that the land of Judah will be an
   astonishment to the Egyptians as well as to other nations, and compare
   this passage with the saying which has formerly come under our
   observation, "You shall be an astonishment." [40] But I think that the
   meaning of the Prophet here is different, for he intended to point out
   the reason why the Lord would make such a display against the
   Egyptians. It was because they had brought destruction on the Jews, for
   they had turned them aside from the confidence which they ought to have
   placed in God, as princes frequently solicit their neighbors, and offer
   them their aid, that they may afterwards make use of them for their own
   advantage. Now the Lord had forbidden them (Deuteronomy 17:16) to
   resort to the Egyptians for the purpose of asking assistance from them;
   but those wretched people, instead of obeying God, listened to the
   solicitation of unbelievers who made offers to them, and on this
   account they were justly punished.

   But the Egyptians also, who had given occasion to their unbelief and
   distrust, did not pass unpunished, for they were so sharply chastised
   that whenever they remembered the Jews they were overwhelmed with
   terror. Hence we ought to draw a profitable doctrine, that they who
   have turned aside the Church from obeying and trusting in God, and who,
   by fear, or counsel, or any enticements, have given occasion for
   offense, will be severely punished. The meaning of the Prophet's words
   is as if we should say, that the look of a woman will bring a blush on
   him who has seduced her, when the disgrace of the uncleanness shall
   have been laid open, and when God shall come forth as the avenger of
   conjugal fidelity.

   18. In that day there shall be five cities. After having threatened the
   Egyptians, and at the same time explained the reason of the divine
   judgment, he comforts them, and promises the mercy of God. He declares
   that they will be in part restored, and will regain a prosperous and
   flourishing condition; for he says that out of six cities five will be
   saved, and only one will perish. He had already foretold a frightful
   destruction to the whole kingdom, so that no one who examines the
   former prediction can think of anything else than a condition that is
   past remedy. He therefore promises that this restoration will be
   accomplished by the extraordinary kindness of God, so that it will be a
   kind of addition to the redemption of the Church, or a large measure of
   the grace of God, when the Redeemer shall be sent.

   The manner of expression is somewhat obscure, but if we observe it
   carefully, there is no difficulty about the meaning; for the Prophet
   means that on1y the sixth part of the cities will be destroyed, and
   that the rest will be saved. The difficulty lies in the word hhrs,
   (hahErEs.) Some read it hchrs, (hachErEs,) that is, of the sun, but
   they have mistaken the letter h (he) for ch (cheth,) which resembles
   it. Those who explain it "of the sun," think that the Prophet spoke of
   Heliopolis; [41] but this does not agree with the context; and he does
   not merely promise that five cities would be restored, (for how
   inconsiderable would such a restoration have been!) but generally, that
   five cities out of six would be saved. We know that the cities in Egypt
   were very numerous. I do not mention the fables of the ancients, and
   those who have assigned to them twenty thousand cities. But still,
   there must have been a vast number of cities in a country so highly
   celebrated, in a kingdom so flourishing and populous, with a climate so
   mild and temperate. Let us then suppose that there were a thousand
   cities in it, or somewhat more. He says that only the sixth part will
   perish, that the rest will be restored, so that but few will be
   destroyed. From what follows it is evident that this restoration must
   be understood to relate to the worship.

   Speaking with the lip of Canaan. By the word lip he means the tongue,
   (sunekdochikos,) taking a part for the whole. He expresses their
   agreement with the people of God, and the faith by which they will make
   profession of the name of God; for by the tongue he metaphorically
   describes confession. Since there was but one language which
   acknowledged and professed the true God, that is, the language of that
   nation which inhabited the land of Canaan, it is evident that by such a
   language must be meant agreement in religion. It is customary enough to
   employ these modes of expression, "to speak the same language," or, "to
   speak a different language," when we intend to describe agreement or
   diversity of opinion. But at the same time it must be remembered that
   it is not every kind of agreement that is sufficient, as if men were to
   form a conspiracy about the worship which they preferred, but if they
   agree in the truth which was revealed to the fathers. He does not
   merely say that the Egyptians will speak the same language, but that
   they will speak the language of Canaan. They must have changed their
   language, and adopted that which God had sanctified; not that the
   dialect was more holy, but it is commended on account of its containing
   the doctrine of truth.

   This ought to be carefully observed, that we may understand what is the
   true method of agreement. We must by all means seek harmony, but we
   must see on what conditions we obtain it; for we must not seek any
   middle course, as is done by those who overturn religion, and yet who
   wish to be regarded as peace-makers. Away with such fickle and
   changeful tongues! Let the truth itself be preserved, which cannot be
   contained but in the word. Whosoever shall determine to agree to it,
   let him talk with us, but away with every one who shall corrupt it,
   choose what language he may. Let us abide firmly by this. It will
   therefore be impossible for the Egyptians to speak the language of
   Canaan till they have first relinquished their own language, that is,
   till they have relinquished all superstitions. Some refer this to the
   age of Ptolemy, but it is absurd, and we may infer from what follows
   that the Prophet speaks of piety and of the true worship of God.

   And swearing by Jehovah of hosts. First, employing a figure of speech
   in which a part is taken for the whole, he shews that their
   conversation will be holy, by exhibiting a single class of them, for in
   swearing they will make profession that they worship the true God. It
   may also be read, swearing to the Lord, or, by the Lord, for l (lamed)
   often signifies by. If we read, "to the Lord," the meaning will be,
   that they will promise obedience to him, and that by a solemn oath, as
   when any nation promises fidelity to its prince; as if he had said,
   "They will acknowledge the authority of God, and submit to his
   government." But since another reading has been more generally
   approved, I willingly adopt it; for since one part of the worship of
   God is swearing, by taking a part for the whole, as I have said, it
   fitly describes the whole of the worship of God. Again, to "swear by
   the Lord" often means to testify that he is the true God. (Deuteronomy
   6:13.) In a word, it denotes a perfect agreement with the Church of
   God.

   Hence we ought to learn that outward confession is a necessary part of
   the true worship of God; for if any person wish to keep his faith shut
   up in his heart, he will have but a cold regard for it. (Romans
   10:9,10.) True faith breaks out into confession, and kindles us to such
   a degree that we actually profess what we inwardly feel. "To me," says
   the Lord in another passage, "every knee shall bow, and every tongue
   shall swear." (Isaiah 45:23.) Accordingly, there ought to be an outward
   worship and outward profession wherever faith dwells. It ought also to
   be observed, that those things which belong to the worship of God ought
   not to be applied to any other purpose, and therefore it is a
   profanation of an oath if we swear by any other. It is written, "Thou
   shalt swear by my name." (Deuteronomy 6:13.) Accordingly, he is
   insulted and robbed of his honor, if the name of saints, or of any
   creature, be employed in an oath. Let it likewise be observed with what
   solemnity oaths should be made; for if by swearing we profess to
   worship God, we ought never to engage in it but with fear and
   reverence.

   One shall be called the city of desolation. When he devotes to
   destruction every sixth city, he means that all who are not converted
   to God, so as to worship him, perish without hope of salvation; for he
   contrasts the cities of Egypt which shall begin to acknowledge God with
   those which are destined to destruction. Where the worship of God is
   wanting, nothing but destruction can remain behind. hrs (hErEs) denotes
   execration and curse, which is followed by ruin and eternal death.

   19. In that day shall there be an altar in the midst of the land of
   Egypt. He continues what he had said in the former verse, and states
   more clearly that the aspect of Egypt will be renewed, because there
   true religion will flourish, the pure worship of God will be set up,
   and all superstitions will fall to the ground. He employs the word
   altar to denote, as by a sign, the worship of God; for sacrifices and
   oblations were the outward acts of piety. By the midst of Egypt he
   means the chief part of the whole kingdom, as if he had said, "in the
   very metropolis," or, "in the very heart of the kingdom."

   And a statue [42] to the Lord. Let it not be supposed that by statue
   are meant images which carry the resemblance of men or of saints; but
   memorials (mnemosuna) of piety; for he means that they will be marks
   similar to those which point out the boundaries of kingdoms, and that
   in this manner signs will be evident, to make known to all men that God
   rules over this nation. And indeed it usually happens that a nation
   truly converted to God, after having laid aside idols and
   superstitions, openly sets up signs of the true religion, that all may
   know that the worship of God is purely observed in it.

   Josephus relates (Ant. 13. 3. 1,) that Onias perverted this passage,
   when he fled to Ptolemy Philometor, [43] whom he persuaded that it
   would be advantageous to erect an altar there, on which the Jews who
   dwelt in that country might sacrifice; and he brought forward this
   passage, alleging that what the Prophet had foretold ought to be
   accomplished. The wicked and ambitious priest persuaded the king to do
   this, though it was openly opposed by the Jews; for the king looked to
   his own advantage, and that scoundrel, who had been deprived of his
   rank, sought to obtain additional honor and advancement; so that no
   entreaty could prevent the execution of that wicked counsel. But Isaiah
   simply describes the pure worship of God under the figure of signs
   which were then in use; for he has his eye upon his own age and the men
   with whom he had to do. This passage, therefore, was wickedly and
   maliciously perverted by Onias.

   But not less impudently do the Popish doctors of the present day
   torture a passage in Malachi to defend the sacrifice of the Mass. When
   he says that "a pure oblation will everywhere be offered to God,"
   (Malachi 1:11,) they infer that it is some sacrifice different from the
   ancient sacrifices, because oxen and sheep must no longer be
   sacrificed, and therefore that it is the Mass. A witty and ingenious
   argument truly! Now, it is evident that under the legal figure Malachi
   describes nothing else than the pure worship of God, as Isaiah does
   here; and we ought carefully to observe such forms of expression, which
   are frequently employed by the prophets.

   This will be clearly explained by a passage in Joel, which we shall
   quote as an example. "Your sons and your daughters," says he, "shall
   prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall
   dream dreams." (Joel 2:28.) Peter shews (Acts 2:16) that this
   prediction was fulfilled, when the apostles spoke various languages
   through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Having formerly been
   uneducated men, they began to be qualified for declaring the mysteries
   of God. On that occasion we perceive no "dreams," so that it might be
   thought that Peter quoted that passage inappropriately; but it is
   evident that Joel there describes nothing else than prophecy, and for
   the purpose of adorning it, he mentioned "visions and dreams," by means
   of which the Lord anciently held communication with the prophets.
   (Numbers 12:6.) He kept in view the ordinary custom of that age; for
   otherwise the Jews would have found it difficult to comprehend the
   gifts of the Spirit which at that time were unknown. Having been reared
   under that preparatory instruction of the Law, [44] they could rise no
   higher than where they were conducted by sacrifices, ceremonies,
   sacraments, and signs. [45] So then the prophets addressed them as
   children, who ought to have nothing set before them beyond what they
   can learn in a homely style (pachumeresteron) by custom and experience.

   This doctrine will unfold to us various passages, the obscurity of
   which might lead to much hesitation. It is plain that the Prophet
   speaks of the kingdom of Christ, and that these things were not
   fulfilled before his coming. We must therefore take away the shadows
   and look at the reality of things, in order that by the altar we may
   understand a true and sincere calling on God. But by these signs the
   Prophet likewise shews that the worship of God cannot be maintained
   without external acts of devotion, though we have no right to lay down
   rules for them. Away with the inventions of men, that we may listen to
   God alone on this subject.

   20. And he will send them a Savior. We cannot serve God unless he first
   bestow his grace upon us; for no one will dedicate himself to God, till
   he be drawn by his goodness, and embrace him with all his heart. He
   must therefore call us to him before we call upon him; we can have no
   access till he first invite us. Formerly he shewed that they must be
   subdued by various afflictions in order that they may submit to God,
   and now he repeats the same thing; for men never deny themselves and
   forsake idle follies any farther than the scourge compels them to yield
   obedience. But he likewise adds another kind of invitation, that,
   having experienced the kindness of God, they will freely approach to
   Him.

   They will cry unto the Lord. The cry of which he speaks proceeds from
   faith, for they would never resort to this refuge till they had been
   allured and delighted by the goodness of God. When the Lord promises
   that he will send a Savior, by whose hand the Egyptians will be
   delivered, this can mean no other than Christ; for Egypt was not
   delivered from its distresses before the doctrine of Christ reached it.
   We read of various changes which that country suffered for four hundred
   years, foreign and civil wars by which it was wasted and almost
   destroyed; but when we would be ready to think that it is utterly
   ruined, lo! it is converted to the Lord, and is rescued from the hand
   of enemies and tyrants. Thus Christ delivered that country, when it had
   begun to know him. In like manner, we must be brought to the knowledge
   and worship of God, that, where we have suffered various afflictions,
   we may learn that salvation is found in him alone. Would that the world
   would now learn this lesson, having suffered so many calamities that it
   appears to be on the brink of ruin! For what can be the issue but that
   it shall either perish or by repentance acknowledge that it has been
   justly punished for so great wickedness?

   That he may deliver them. When he adds these words, we ought to draw
   from them a profitable doctrine, that God assists us through Christ, by
   whose agency he gave deliverance to his own people from the beginning.
   He has always been the Mediator, by whose intercession all blessings
   were obtained from God the Father; and now that he has been revealed,
   let us learn that nothing can be obtained from God but through him.
   [46]

   21. And the Lord shall be known by the Egyptians. Isaiah now adds what
   was most important; for we cannot worship the Lord, or call upon him,
   till we have first acknowledged him to be our Father. "How," says Paul,
   "shall they call on him whom they know not?" [47] (Romans 10:14.) We
   cannot be partakers of the gifts of God for our salvation without
   previously having true knowledge, which is by faith. He therefore
   properly adds, the knowledge of God, as the foundation of all religion,
   or the key that opens to us the gate of the heavenly kingdom. Now,
   there cannot be knowledge without doctrine; and hence infer, that God
   disapproves of all kinds of false worship; for he cannot approve of
   anything that is not guided by knowledge, which springs from hearing
   true and pure doctrine. Whatever contrivance therefore men may make out
   of their own minds, they will never attain by it the true worship of
   God. We ought carefully to observe passages like this, in which the
   Spirit of God shews what is the true worship and calling of God, that,
   having abandoned the inventions to which men are too obstinately
   attached, we may allow ourselves to be taught by the pure word of God,
   and, relying on his authority, may freely and boldly condemn all that
   the world applauds and admires.

   The Egyptians shall know. It is not without good reason that he twice
   mentions this knowledge. A matter of so great importance ought not to
   be slightly passed by; for it holds the chief place, and without it
   there is nothing that can properly be called worship.

   And shall make sacrifice and oblation. This passage must be explained
   in the same manner as the former, in which he mentioned an altar. What
   would have been the use of sacrifices after the manifestation of
   Christ? He therefore describes metaphorically confession of faith and
   calling on God, which followed the preaching of the gospel. Here he
   includes everything that was offered to God -- slain beasts, bread,
   fruits of every description, and all that was fitted to express
   gratitude. But we must attend to the difference between the Old and New
   Testaments, and under the shadows of ceremonies we must understand to
   be meant that "reasonable worship" of which Paul speaks. (Romans 12:1.)

   And shall vow vows to the Lord and perform them. What he adds about
   vows is likewise a part of the worship of God. The Jews were accustomed
   to express their gratitude to God by vows, and especially they rendered
   thanksgiving by a solemn vow, when they had received from God any
   extraordinary blessing. Of their own accord also, when any one chose to
   do so, they made vows on various occasions. (Deuteronomy 12:6;
   23:21-23.) And yet every person was not at liberty to make this or that
   vow according to his own pleasure; but a rule was laid down. (Numbers
   30:3.) Whatever may be in that respect, it is evident that by the word
   vows the Prophet means nothing else than the worship of God, to which
   the Egyptians devoted themselves after having learned it from the word
   of God; but he mentions the acts of devotion by which the Jews made
   profession of the true worship and religion.

   Hence the Papists draw an argument to prove, that whatever we vow to
   God ought to be performed; but since they make vows at random, and
   without any exercise of judgment, this passage lends no aid to defend
   their error. Isaiah foretells what the Egyptians will do, after having
   embraced and followed the instruction given by God. [48] In like
   manner, when David exhorts the people to vow and to perform their vows,
   (Psalm 76:11,) they think that he is on their side; but be does not
   therefore exhort them to make unlawful and rash vows. (Ecclesiastes
   5:2.) There always remains in force the law of vows, which we are not
   at liberty to transgress, namely, the word of God, by which we learn
   what he requires from us, and what he wishes us to vow and perform. We
   never received permission to vow whatever we please, because we are too
   much disposed to go to excess, and to take every kind of liberty with
   regard to God, and because we act more imprudently towards him than if
   we had to deal with men. It was therefore necessary that men should be
   laid under some restraint to prevent them from taking so great
   liberties in the worship of God and religion.

   This being the case, it is evident that God permits nothing but what is
   agreeable to his law, and that he rejects everything else as
   unacceptable and superstitious. What a man has vowed of his own accord,
   and without the support of the word, cannot be binding. If he perform
   it, he offends doubly; first, in vowing rashly, as if he were sporting
   with God; and secondly, in executing his resolutions wickedly and
   rashly, when he ought rather to have set them aside and repented. So
   far, therefore, is any man from being bound by vows, that he ought, on
   the contrary, to turn back and acknowledge his sinful rashness.

   Now, if any one inquire about the vows of Papists, it will be easy to
   shew that they derive no support from the word of God. If those things
   which they highly applaud and reckon to be lawful, such as the vows of
   monks, are unlawful and wicked, what opinion must we form of the rest?
   They vow perpetual celibacy, as if it were indiscriminately permitted
   to all; but we know that the gift of continence is not an ordinary
   gift, and is not promised to every one, not even to those who in other
   respects are endued with extraordinary graces. Abraham was eminent for
   faith, steadfastness, meekness, and holiness, and yet he did not
   possess this gift. (Genesis 11:29; 25:1.) Christ himself, when the
   apostles loudly commended this state of celibacy, testified that it is
   not given to all. (Matthew 19:11,12.) Paul states the same thing. (1
   Corinthians 7:7,9,26.) Whosoever, therefore, does not possess this gift
   of continence, if he vow it, does wrong, and will be justly punished
   for his rashness. Hence have arisen dreadful instances of want of
   chastity, by which God has justly punished Popery for this presumption.

   They likewise vow poverty, as if they would have nothing of their own,
   though they have abundance of everything beyond other men. Is not this
   an open mockery of God? The obedience which they vow is full of deceit;
   for they shake off the yoke of Christ, that they may become the slaves
   of men. Others vow pilgrimages, to abstain from eating flesh, to
   observe days, and other things full of superstition. Others promise to
   God toys and trinkets, as if they were dealing with a child. We would
   be ashamed to act thus, or to pursue such a line of conduct towards
   men, among whom nothing is settled till it has been agreed to on both
   sides by mutual consent. Much less is it lawful to attempt anything in
   the worship of God but what has been declared by his word. What kind of
   worship will it be, if the judgment of God has no weight with us, and
   if we yield only to the will of men? Will it be possible that it can
   please God? Will it not be (ethelothreskeia) "will-worship," which Paul
   so severely censures? (Colossians 2:23.) In vain, therefore, do they
   who make such vows boast that they serve God; and in vain do they
   endeavor to find support in this passage; for the Lord abhors that kind
   of worship.

   22. Therefore Jehovah will smite Egypt. From what has been already said
   the Prophet draws the conclusion, that the chastisement which he has
   mentioned will be advantageous to the Egyptians, because it will be a
   preparation for their conversion; [49] as if he had said, that it will
   be for the good of Egypt that the Lord will punish her. Those who
   translate the words, "he will strike with a wound that may be healed,"
   misinterpret this passage, and greatly weaken the Prophet's meaning;
   for it means that the wounds will be advantageous to them, and that by
   means of these wounds the Lord will bring them back. Hence we ought to
   conclude, that we must not refuse to be chastised by God, for it is
   done for our benefit. (Proverbs 3:11, 12; Hebrews 12:5-7.) Exemption
   from punishment would cherish a disposition to sin with less control.
   As men are exceedingly prone to give way to their own inclinations,
   whenever God spares them for a little, it is necessary on this account
   that the Lord should prevent this danger, which he does by
   chastisements and stripes, which excite and arouse us to repentance. A
   remarkable instance of this is here exhibited in Egypt, which abounded
   in superstitions and wickedness, and went beyond all nations in
   idolatry, and yet experienced the mercy of God.

   For they shall be turned to Jehovah. We must attend to the manner of
   its accomplishment, which is, their conversion to God. It is the
   explanation of the former clause; as if he had said, "God will heal the
   Egyptians, because they shall be converted." The copulative v (vau)
   signifies for. Hence we infer that conversion may be said to be a
   resurrection from eternal death. We are utterly ruined so long as we
   are turned away from God; but when we are converted, we return to his
   favor, and are delivered from death; not that we deserve the favor of
   God by our repentance, but because in this manner God raises us up, as
   it were, from death to life. To repentance is added a promise, from
   which we conclude, that when we sincerely repent, [50] we do not in
   vain implore forgiveness. Now, when the Prophet says that the Lord will
   be gracious and reconciled to the Egyptians, he at the same time shews,
   that as soon as they have been converted, they will obtain forgiveness.
   It will therefore be a true conversion when it is followed by a calling
   on God. But without faith (Romans 10:14) it is impossible to call on
   God; for even the ungodly may acknowledge sin; but no man will have
   recourse to the mercy of God, or obtain reconciliation, till he be
   moved by a true feeling of repentance, which is likewise accompanied by
   faith.

   And will heal them. He does not repeat what he had said, that God
   strikes in order to heal; but he promises healing in another sense,
   that is, that God will cease to inflict punishments. The former
   healing, which he mentioned a little before, was internal; but the
   latter relates to stripes and wounds. In short, he means that it will
   be a speedy remedy for all their distresses. After having been
   reconciled to God, there is nothing in us that calls for punishment;
   for whence comes punishment but on account of guilt? and when guilt is
   pardoned, exemption from punishment will quickly follow. [51] And if we
   be chastised, it is an evidence that we are not yet sufficiently
   prepared for repentance.

   In a word, let us remember this order, which the Prophet points out to
   us; first, that stripes prepare men for repentance; secondly, that they
   are healed, because they are delivered from eternal destruction;
   thirdly, that when they have been brought to the knowledge of their
   guilt, they obtain pardon; fourthly, that God is gracious and
   reconciled to them; fifthly, that chastisements cease after they have
   obtained pardon from God. There is no man who ought not to acknowledge
   in himself what Isaiah here declares concerning the Egyptians, in whom
   the Lord holds out an example to the whole world.

   23. In that day. The Prophet now foretells that the Lord will diffuse
   his goodness throughout the whole world; as if he had said, "It will
   not be shut up in a corner, or exclusively known, as it formerly was,
   by a single nation." Here he speaks of two nations that were the most
   inveterate enemies of the Church, and that appeared to be farther
   removed than any other from the kingdom of God; for much more might
   have been expected from distant nations, because the nations here
   mentioned openly made war with God and persecuted his Church. And if
   the Lord is so gracious to the deadly enemies of the Church, that he
   pardons and adopts them to be his children, what shall be the case with
   other nations? This prophecy thus includes the calling of all nations.

   There shall be a highway. Now, when he says that, in consequence of a
   highway having been opened up, there will be mutual access that they
   may visit each other, he describes brotherly intercourse. We know that
   the Egyptians carried on almost incessant wars with the Assyrians, and
   cherished an inveterate hatred towards each other. He now foretells
   that the Lord will change their dispositions, and will reconcile them
   to each other, so that they will have mutual communications, mutual
   coming in and going out, in consequence of laying open the highways
   which were formerly shut. Here we ought to observe what we formerly
   remarked at the fourth verse of the second chapter, [52] namely, that
   when men have been reconciled to God, it is likewise proper that they
   should cherish brotherly kindness towards each other. Strife,
   quarreling, disputes, hatred, and malice, ought to cease when God has
   been pacified. We need not wonder, therefore, that he says that a
   highway to Egypt is opened up for the Assyrians; but this ought
   undoubtedly to be referred to the reign of Christ, for we do not read
   that the Egyptians were on a friendly footing with the Assyrians till
   after they had known Christ.

   And the Egyptians shall serve the Assyrians, (or, with the Assyrians.)
   [53] This clause may be rendered, "shall serve God;" but as the name of
   God is not expressed here, it may refer to the Assyrians, which is also
   pointed out by the particle 't (Eth.) [54] It may therefore be
   explained thus. They who formerly burned with a desire to injure one
   another will be changed in their dispositions, and will desire to shew
   kindness. In short, the fruit of true repentance will be made evident,
   for they who formerly distressed each other in mutual wars will lend
   mutual aid. And this opinion will agree very well with those words of
   the Prophet with which they stand connected. Yet I do not set aside
   another interpretation which is almost universally adopted, namely,
   "They who formerly worshipped other gods will henceforth acknowledge
   one God, and will assent to the same confession of faith." I leave
   every one to adopt that interpretation which he thinks best. If the
   latter interpretation be preferred, the Prophet makes brotherly love to
   flow from godliness, [55] as from its source.

   24. In that day shall Israel. Isaiah concludes the promise which he had
   briefly glanced at, that the Egyptians and Assyrians, as well as
   Israel, shall be blessed. Formerly the grace of God was in some measure
   confined to Israel, because with that nation only had the Lord entered
   into covenant. The Lord had stretched out "his cord" over Jacob,
   (Deuteronomy 32:9,) as Moses speaks; [56] and David says,

   "He hath not done so to any nation, and hath not made known to them his
   judgments." (Psalm 147:20.)

   In a word, the blessing of God dwelt solely in Judea, but he says that
   it will be shared with the Egyptians and Assyrians, under whose name he
   includes also the rest of the nations. He does not mention them for the
   purpose of shewing respect, but because they were the constant enemies
   of God, and appeared to be more estranged from him and farther removed
   from the hope of favor than all others. Accordingly, though he had
   formerly adopted none but the children of Abraham, he now wished to be
   called, without distinction, "The father of all nations." (Genesis
   17:7; Exodus 19:5,6; Deuteronomy 7:6, 14:2.)

   Israel shall be the third blessing. Some render it, Israel shall be the
   third [57] I do not approve of that rendering; for the adjective being
   in the feminine gender, ought to be construed with the noun vrkh,
   (berachah,) blessing, and blessing means here a form or pattern of
   blessing.

   25. Because the Lord of hosts will bless him. [58] He assigns a reason,
   and explains the former statement; for he shews that, through the
   undeserved goodness of God, the Assyrians and Egyptians shall be
   admitted to fellowship with the chosen people of God. As if he had
   said, "Though these titles belonged exclusively to Israel, they shall
   likewise be conferred on other nations, which the Lord hath adopted to
   be his own." There is a mutual relation between God and his people, so
   that they who are called by his mouth "a holy people," (Exodus 19:6,)
   may justly, in return, call him their God. Yet this designation is
   bestowed indiscriminately on Egyptians and Assyrians.

   Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands. Though
   the Prophet intended to describe foreign nations as associated with the
   Jews who had belonged to God's household, yet he employs most
   appropriate marks to describe the degrees. By calling the Egyptians
   "the people of God," he means that they will share in the honor which
   God deigned to bestow in a peculiar manner on the Jews alone. When he
   calls Assyrians the work of his hands, he distinguishes them by the
   title peculiar to his Church. We have elsewhere remarked [59] that the
   Church is called "the workmanship" (to poiema) of God, (Ephesians
   2:10,) because by the spirit of regeneration believers are created
   anew, so as to bear the image of God. Thus, he means that we are "the
   work of God's hands," not so far as we are created to be men, but so
   far as they who are separated from the world, and become new creatures,
   are created anew to a new life. Hence we acknowledge that in "newness
   of life" nothing ought to be claimed as our own, for we are wholly "the
   work of God."

   And Israel my inheritance. When he comes to Israel, he invests him with
   his prerogative, which is, that he is the inheritance of God, so that
   among the new brethren he still holds the rank and honor of the
   first-born. The word inheritance suggests the idea of some kind of
   superiority; and indeed that covenant which the Lord first made with
   them, bestowed on them the privilege which cannot be made void by their
   ingratitude; for "the gifts and calling of God are without repentance,"
   as Paul declares, (Romans 11:29,) who shews that in the house of God
   they are the first-born. (Ephesians 2:12.) Although therefore the grace
   of God is now more widely spread, yet they still hold the highest rank,
   not by their own merit, but by the firmness of the promises.

   translators "and a great one," Calvin takes no notice. Rosenmüller
   considers rv (rab) to be the participle Kal of rvv, (rub,) and assigns
   to Cocceius the honor of having discovered that the punctuation, which
   the Masoretic annotators have set aside, in the parallel passage of
   Deuteronomy, as a peculiarity for which they could not account, was the
   key to the true interpretation. Almost all the commentators, Cocceius
   excepted, render rv (rab) "a great one," some of them supposing that
   Ptolemy the Great, the son of Lagus, and others that Alexander the
   Great, was meant. But Cocceius was the first to perceive that the
   signification "Great" does not agree with the context, and has justly
   remarked that the word rv (rab) with a Kametz, ought not to be
   confounded with rv (rab,) with a Pathach, but that its meaning should
   be sought from the verb rvv (rub) or ryv (rib,) "to contend, to argue,
   to defend one's cause in a court of justice;" and he quotes a parallel
   passage, in which Moses, while he blesses Judah, speaking of God, says,
   ydyv rv lv (yadaiv rab lO) "his hands shall be his protector."
   (Deuteronomy 33:7.) See Robertson's Clavis Pentateuchi, p. 561. The
   ancients appear to have taken a similar view. The Septuagint renders it
   thus. Kai apostelei autois anthropon hos sosei autous, krinon sosei
   autous. The Chaldee and Syriac render it, "a deliverer and a judge,"
   and Jerome's rendering is, propuqnatorem, "a defender or champion".
   Rosenmüller Scholia. "A Savior and a vindicator". Lowth. "An advocate".
   Stock. "The explanation of rv, (rab) as a participle," says Professor
   Alexander, "is found in all the ancient versions, and is adopted by
   most modern writers." -- Ed. ^FT304 The words of the Apostle are, "How
   shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?" But Calvin's
   remark, which immediately follows, vindicates the appropriateness,
   though not the verbal accuracy, of the quotation. -- Ed. ^FT305 "La
   doctrine de salut;" "The doctrine of salvation." ^FT306 "Ce sera un
   preparatif pour les amener à repentance;" -- "It will be a preparation
   to lead them to repentance." ^FT307 "Pourvenu que notre repentance ne
   soit hypocritique;" -- "Provided that our repentance be not
   hypocritical." ^FT308 "D'où viennent les chastimens, si non de nos
   pechez? S'ils sont pardonnez, aussi le sont les chastimens meritez a
   cause d'iceux." -- "Whence come chastisements but from our sins? If
   they are remitted, so are also the chastisements deserved on account of
   them." ^FT309 See [8]vol. 1 p. 101 ^FT310 This is the Author's version.
   See [9]p. 48 ^FT311 The particle 't (Eth) does not decide the question,
   for it may either be the sign of the accusative case, or a preposition
   signifying with. Professor Alexander adopts the latter view, and argues
   powerfully in favor of the rendering, "they shall serve God," in which
   he concurs with Lowth, "And the Egyptian shall worship with the
   Assyrian," and with Stock, "And Egypt shall serve [God] with Assyria."
   -- Ed. ^FT312 "De la crainte de Dieu," -- "from the fear of God."
   ^FT313 "Jacob is the lot (Heb. cord) of his inheritance." -- Eng. Ver.
   ^FT314 "The meaning obviously is," says Professor Alexander, "that
   Israel should be one of three, or a party to a triple union." By an
   analagous idiom of the Greek language, Peter calls Noah ogdoon, "the
   eighth," that is, "one of eight persons." (2 Peter 2:5.) From classical
   writers other instances might be given, such as eis oikian dodekatos
   "he went to his house the twelfth," or, "one of twelve," that is,
   "along with eleven other persons." -- Ed. ^FT315 "Whom the Lord of
   hosts shall bless." -- Eng. Ver. ^FT316 Our Author perhaps refers to
   his expository remarks on Ephesians 2:10, Isaiah 17:7, Isaiah 64:7, See
   [10]p. 26

   Isaiah Chapter 20:1-6

   1. In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of
   Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;

   1. Anno quo venit Thartan in Asdod, cum misisset eum Sargon rex
   Assyriæ, oppugnassetque Asdod, et cepisset;

   2. At the same time spake the Lord by Isaiah the son Amoz, saying, Go
   and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thy shoe from
   thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.

   2. Tempore illo, inquam, loquutus est Iehova iu manu Isaiæ filii Amoz,
   dicendo: Vade et solve saccum de lumbis tuis, et calceamentum tuum
   exrahe de pede tuo; fecitque sic, ambulans nudus et discalceatus.

   3. And the Lord said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and
   barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon
   Ethiopia;

   3. Et dixit Iehova: Sicut ambulavit servus meus Isaias nudus et
   discalceatus tribus annis, signum et portentum super Ægypto et
   Ethiopia;

   4. So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and
   the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with
   their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.

   4. Ita abducet rex Assur captivitatem Ægypti, et transmigrationem
   Æthiopiæ juvenum et senum, nudam et discalceatam, et discoopertos
   natibus in ignominiam Ægypti.

   5. And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation,
   and of Egypt their glory.

   5. Et timebunt, et pudefient ab Æthiopia respectu suo, et ab Ægypto
   gloriatione (vel, pulchritudine) sua.

   6. And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold, such
   is our expectation, whither we flee for help to be delivered from the
   king of Assyria: and how shall we escape?

   6. Dicetque incola insulæ hujus in die illa; Ecce, quomodo habeat
   respectus noster, quo confugimus auxilii causa, ut liberemur a facie
   regis Assur; et quomodo effugiemus nos?


   1. In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod. In the preceding chapter
   Isaiah prophesied about the calamity which threatened Egypt, and at the
   same time promised to it the mercy of God. He now introduces the same
   subject, and shews that Israel will be put to shame by this
   chastisement of the Egyptians, because they placed their confidence in
   Egypt. He now joins Ethiopia, which makes it probable that the
   Ethiopians were leagued with the Egyptians, as I have formerly
   remarked, and as we shall see again at the thirty-seventh chapter.

   First, we must observe the time of this prediction. It was when the
   Jews were pressed hard by necessity to resort, even against their will,
   to foreign nations for assistance. Sacred history informs us (2 Kings
   18:17) that Tartan was one of Sennacherib's captains, which constrains
   us to acknowledge that this Sargon was Sennacherib, who had two names,
   as may be easily learned from this passage. We must also consider what
   was the condition of Israel, for the ten tribes had been led into
   captivity. Judea appeared almost to be utterly ruined, for nearly the
   whole country was conquered, except Jerusalem, which was besieged by
   Rabshakeh. (2 Kings 18:13.) Tartan, on the other hand, was besieging
   Ashdod. Sacred history (2 Kings 18:17) mentions three captains; [60]
   and this makes it probable that Sennacherib's forces were at that time
   divided into three parts, that at the same instant he might strike
   terror on all, and might throw them into such perplexity and confusion
   that they could not render assistance to each other. Nothing was now
   left for the Jews but to call foreign nations to their aid. In the mean
   time, Isaiah is sent by God to declare that their expectation is vain
   in relying on the Egyptians, against whom the arm of the Lord was now
   lifted up, and who were so far from assisting them, that they were
   unable to defend themselves against their enemies. Hence the Jews ought
   to acknowledge that they are justly punished for their unbelief,
   because they had forsaken God and fled to the Egyptians.

   We must consider the end which is here proposed, for the design of God
   was not to forewarn the Egyptians, but to correct the unbelief of the
   people, which incessantly carried them away to false and wicked hopes.
   In order therefore to teach them that they ought to rely on God alone,
   the Prophet here foretells what awaits their useless helpers. The
   warning was highly seasonable, for the Ethiopians had begun to repel
   the Assyrians, and had forced them to retire, and no event could have
   occurred which would have been more gladly hailed by the Jews. Lest
   those successful beginnings should make them wanton, he foretells that
   this aid will be of short duration, because both the Ethiopians and the
   Egyptians will soon be most disgracefully vanquished.

   2. Go and loose the sackcloth from thy loins. In order to confirm this
   prophecy by the use of a symbol, the Lord commanded Isaiah to walk
   naked. If Isaiah had done this of his own accord, he would have been
   justly ridiculed; but when he does it by the command of the Lord, we
   perceive nothing but what is fitted to excite admiration and to strike
   awe. In this nakedness, and in the signs of a similar kind, something
   weighty is implied. Besides, the Lord does nothing either by himself or
   by his servants without likewise explaining the reason; and therefore
   the Prophet does not merely walk naked, but points out the design which
   the Lord had in view in ordering him to do so. In other respects false
   prophets imitate the true servants of God, and put on varied and
   imposing shapes, to dazzle the eyes of the multitude, and gain credit
   to themselves; but those symbols are worthless, because God is not the
   author of them.

   This ought to be carefully observed in opposition to the Papists, who
   bring forward empty ceremonies instead of true sacraments. This is the
   rule with which we ought to meet them. If they proceed from God, we
   ought to embrace them, but if not, we may boldly reject them; and,
   indeed, they cannot be adopted without offering an insult to God,
   because in such cases men usurp his authority. Besides, God does not
   bring forward signs without the word, for what would a sacrament be if
   we beheld nothing but the sign? It is the doctrine alone that makes the
   sacrament, and therefore let us know that it is mere hypocrisy where no
   doctrine is taught, and that Papists act wickedly when they lay aside
   doctrine, and give the name of sacrament to empty ceremonies; for the
   Lord has connected them in such a manner that no man can separate them
   without infringing that order which he has enjoined.

   When the Lord commands him to loose the sackcloth; almost all the
   commentators infer from it that Isaiah at that time wore a garment of
   mourning, because he bewailed the distressed condition of Israel; for
   sackcloth was a mourning dress, as is evident from Joel (Joel 1:13.)
   Their interpretation is, that this was done in order that, in the dress
   of culprits, he might supplicate pardon from God, or that it was
   impossible for his countenance or his dress to be cheerful when his
   heart was sad, and he could not but be affected with the deepest grief
   when he beheld so great a calamity. Some think that it was his ordinary
   dress, because the Prophets, as Zechariah informs us, commonly wore a
   mantle. (Zechariah 13:4.) But that conjecture rests on exceedingly
   slight grounds, and has no great probability. It is more probable that
   he wore sackcloth as expressive of mourning. Judea was at that time
   sunk into such a state of indifference, that when men saw their
   brethren wretchedly distressed and wasted, still they were not affected
   by it, and did not think that the affliction of their brethren was a
   matter which at all concerned them. They still thought that they were
   beyond the reach of danger, and mocked at the Prophets when they
   threatened and foretold destruction. Hence Micah also complains that no
   man bewails the distresses of Israel. (Micah 1:11.)

   A question arises, Was this actually done, or was it merely and simply
   a vision which he told to the people? The general opinion is, that the
   Prophet never went naked, but that this was exhibited to him in a
   vision, and only once. They allege as a reason, that on account of heat
   and cold, and other inconveniences of the weather, he could not have
   walked naked during the whole period of three years. What if we should
   say that the Prophet wore clothes at home, and also in public, unless
   when he wished to come forth to teach, and that on such occasions he
   was accustomed to present to the people a spectacle of nakedness? I pay
   little attention to the argument, that he was unable to endure heat and
   cold; for God, who commanded him to do this, could easily strengthen
   and protect him. But they assign another reason, that nakedness would
   have been unbecoming in a Prophet. I answer, this nakedness was not
   more unbecoming than circumcision, which irreligious men might consider
   to be the most absurd of all sights, because it made an exposure of the
   uncomely parts. Yet it must not be thought that the Prophet went
   entirely naked, or without covering those parts which would present a
   revolting aspect. It was enough that the people understood what the
   Lord was doing, and were affected by it as something extraordinary.

   I am led to form this opinion by what is here said, "By the hand of
   Isaiah;" for although this mode of expression frequently occurs
   elsewhere, still we never find it where it does not imply something
   emphatic, to describe the effect produced. He places himself in the
   midst between God and his countrymen, so as to be the herald of a
   future calamity, not only in words, but likewise by a visible symbol.
   Nor is it superfluous that it is immediately added, He did so. I am
   therefore of opinion that Isaiah walked naked whenever he discharged
   the office of a prophet, and that he uncovered those parts which could
   be beheld without shame.

   So far as relates to sackcloth, although it was customary for men in
   private stations of life to express their guilt in this manner in
   adversity, yet it is probable that it was with a view to his office
   that Isaiah made use of this symbol to confirm his doctrine, that he
   might the better arouse the people from their sluggishness. If at any
   time the Lord chastise ourselves or our brethren, he does not enjoin us
   to change our raiment, but we are cruel and (astorgoi) without natural
   affection, if we are not moved by the afflictions of brethren and the
   ruin of the Church. If we have any feeling towards God, we ought to be
   in sadness and tears; and if it be our duty to mourn, we ought also to
   exhort others and stimulate them by our example to feel the calamities
   of the Church, and to be touched with some (sumpatheia) compassion.

   3. Three years. Why for such a period? Because that was the time
   granted to the Egyptians and Ethiopians, during which the Lord gave
   them a truce for repentance, and at the same time wished to make trial
   of the obedience of his people, that without delay they might
   relinquish unlawful aid, and that, though the Egyptians and Ethiopians
   appeared to be secure, they might know that they were not far from
   ruin. The Lord intended also to expose the rebellion of wicked men; for
   undoubtedly many persons made an open display of their impiety when
   they despised the nakedness of the prophet, and the godly, on the other
   hand, moved by the sight of his nakedness, though the prosperity of the
   Ethiopians was delightfully attractive, still did not hesitate to fix
   their attention on the word. What they were bound to consider was not
   the nakedness itself, but the mark which the Lord had put upon it; in
   the same manner as, in the visible sacraments, we ought to behold those
   things which are invisible.

   4. The captivity of Egypt and the removal of Ethiopia. [61] The words
   "captivity" and "removal" are taken collectively, to denote the
   multitude of captives and emigrants. Next, he shews that there will be
   no distinction of age, declaring that the old, as well as the young,
   shall be led into captivity.

   5. And they shall be afraid. He now shews for whose benefit he had
   foretold these things about the Egyptians and Ethiopians. It was in
   order that the Jews might learn amidst their afflictions to hope in
   God, and might not have recourse to foreign aid, which the Lord had
   forbidden.

   6. Lo, what is become of our expectation? He calls them expectation, or
   lurking, because the Jews turned towards them, whenever they were
   oppressed by any calamity, and placed their hope in them. We are
   accustomed to turn our eyes to that quarter from which we expect any
   assistance. Hence also, to "look" often signifies, in the Hebrew
   language, to "hope." (Psalms 34:5; Job 6:19.) Now, they ought to have
   looked to God alone. Their wandering levity is therefore censured. And
   the same thing must happen to us, and deservedly, that when we have
   been invited by God, and refuse the sure refuge which he offers to us,
   and allow ourselves to be captivated by the delusions of Satan, we may
   lie down naked and destitute with shame and disgrace.

   And the inhabitants of the island shall say. He gives the name island
   not only to Jerusalem, but to the whole of Judea; and it is generally
   thought that the name is given because its shores are washed by the
   Mediterranean sea. But I think that there is a different reason for
   this metaphor, for it is but a small portion of the sea that washes it;
   but as an island is separated from other lands, so the Lord separated
   Judea from other countries. It was kept apart from all the nations,
   which cherished a mortal hatred towards the Jews; for there was a
   "wall" between them, as Paul says, (Ephesians 2:14,) which Christ at
   length threw down. Here again Isaiah confirms his prophecy. If you are
   not now moved by my nakedness, you shall one day be taught by the
   event, that these words were not spoken to you in vain. Thus, at a late
   hour, obstinate and rebellious men are constrained by God to confess
   their guilt, so that they are struck with amazement, and argue within
   themselves how they could be so greatly blinded by their own
   stubbornness.

   Isaiah Chapter 21:1-17

   1. The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass
   through; so it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.

   1. Onus deserti maris, Sicut tempestates in australi regione,
   transituræ a deserto, veniet a terra horribili.

   2. A grievous vision is declared unto me: The treacherous dealer
   dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam;
   besiege, O Media: all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.

   2. Visio dura indicata est mihi: transgressor transgressori, et
   vastator vastatori. Ascende, Persa; obside, Mede; omnem gemitum ejus
   cessare feci.

   3. Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon
   me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the
   hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it

   3. Propterea impleti sunt lumbi mei dolore; angustiæ corripuerunt me,
   sicut angustiæ parturientis; incurvatus sum audiendo, et videndo
   obstupui.

   4. My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure
   hath he turned into fear unto me.

   4. Concussum est cor meum; horror perterruit me; noctem deliciarum
   mearum posuit mihi in horrorem.

   5. Prepare the table, watch in the watch-tower, eat, drink: arise, ye
   princes, and anoint the shield.

   5. Adorna mensam, speculare in specula, comede, bibe; surgite,
   Principes, et ungite clypeum.

   6. For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him
   declare what he seeth.

   6. Quoniam sic dixit ad me Dominus: Vade, constitue vigilem, qui
   annuntiet quod viderit.

   7. And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses,
   and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed.

   7. Et vidit currum paris equitum, currum asini, et currum cameli;
   deinde attentius speculatus est, multum, inquam, speculatus est.

   8. And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the
   watch-tower in the day-time, and I am set in my ward whole nights;

   8. Tum clamavit, Leo. In specula mea, Domine mi, jugiter sto interdiu,
   et totis noctibus in custodia mea locatus sum.

   9. And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of
   horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and
   all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.

   9. Et ecce, hic venit currus hominis, par equitum. Et loquutus est, ac
   dixit, Cecidit, cecidit Babel, et omnia sculptilia deorum ejus
   contrivit ad terram.

   10. O my thrashing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard
   of the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.

   10. Tritura mea, et filius areæ meæ. Quæ audivi a Iehova exercituum Deo
   Israel, nuntiavi vobis.

   11. The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what
   of the night? Watchman, what of the night?

   11. Onus Duma. Clamat ad me ex Seir: Custos, quid de nocte? Custos,
   quid de nocte?

   12. The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye
   will enquire, enquire ye; return, come.

   12. Dixit custos: Venit mane, postea nox. Si interrogavaris,
   interrogate. Revertimini, venite.

   13. The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O
   ye travelling companies of Dedanim.

   13. Onus in Arabia. In nemore in Arabia pernoctabitis, in viis Dedanim.

   14. The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was
   thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.

   14. In occursum ferte aquas sitienti, icolæ terræ Tema, pane suo
   succurrite profugo.

   15. For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the
   bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.

   15. Quia a facie gladiorum fugiunt, a facie gladii extenti, a facie
   arcus intenti, a facie gravitatis belli.

   16. Fore thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to
   the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:

   16. Nam sic dixit mihi Dominus: Adhuc annus, secundum annos mercenarii,
   tum deficiet omnis gloria Cedar;

   17. And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the
   children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the Lord God of Israel hath
   spoken it

   17. Et residuum arcus, quod numerabitur fortium filiorum Cedar,
   imminuetur; quoniam Iehova Deus Israel loquutus est.


   1. The burden of the desert of the sea. The Prophet, after having
   taught that their hope ought to be placed, not on the Egyptians, but on
   the mercy of God alone, and after having foretold that calamities would
   come on the nations on whose favor they relied, adds a consolation in
   order to encourage the hearts of the godly. He declares, that for the
   Chaldeans, to whom they will be captives, a reward is prepared; from
   which it follows, that God takes account of the injuries which they
   endure. By the desert [62] he means Chaldea, not that it was deserted
   or thinly inhabited, but because the Jews had a desert on that side of
   them; just as if, instead of Italy, we should name "the Alps," because
   they are nearer to us, and because we must cross them on our road to
   Italy. This reason ought to be kept in view; for he does not describe
   the nature of the country, but forewarns the Jews that the destruction
   of the enemies, which he foretells, is near at hand, and is as certain
   as if the event had been before their eyes, as that desert was.
   Besides, the prophets sometimes spoke ambiguously about Babylon, that
   believers alone might understand the hidden mysteries, as Jeremiah
   changes the king's name. [63]

   As storms from the south. He says from the south, because that wind is
   tempestuous, and produces storms and whirlwinds. [64] When he adds that
   "it cometh from the desert," this tends to heighten the picture; for if
   any storm arise in a habitable and populous region, it excites less
   terror than those which spring up in deserts. In order to express the
   shocking nature of this calamity, he compares it to storms, which begin
   in the desert, and afterwards take a more impetuous course, and rush
   with greater violence.

   Yet the Prophet appears to mean something else, namely, that as they
   burst forth like storms from that direction to lay Judea desolate, so
   another storm would soon afterwards arise to destroy them; and
   therefore he says that this burden will come from a terrible land. By
   this designation I understand Judea to be meant, for it was not enough
   to speak of the ruin of Babylon, if the Jews did not likewise
   understand that it came from God. Why he calls it "a terrible land" we
   have seen in our exposition of the eighteenth chapter. [65] It was
   because, in consequence of so many displays of the wrath of God, its
   disfigured appearance might strike terror on all. The occasion on which
   the words are spoken does not allow us to suppose that it is called
   "terrible" on account of the astonishing power of God by which it was
   protected. Although therefore Babylon was taken and plundered by the
   Persians and Medes, Isaiah declares that its destruction will come from
   Judea; because in this manner God will revenge the injuries done to
   that nation of which he had promised to be the guardian.

   2. A harsh vision. As the object was to soothe the grief of the people,
   it may be thought not to be appropriate to call a vision, which is the
   occasion of joy, a harsh vision. But this refers to the Babylonians,
   who, puffed up with their prosperity, dreaded no danger; for wealth
   commonly produces pride and indifference. As if he had said, "It is
   useless to hold out the riches and power of the Babylonians, and when a
   stone is hard, there will be found a hard hammer to break it."

   The spoiler. As Babylon had gained its power by plundering and laying
   waste other nations, it seemed to be free from all danger. Although
   they had been a terror to others, and had practiced every kind of
   barbarity and cruelty, yet they could not avoid becoming a prey and
   enduring injuries similar to those which they had inflicted on others.
   The Prophet goes farther, and, in order to obtain credit to his
   statements, pronounces it to be a righteous retaliation, that violence
   should correspond to violence.

   Go up, O Elam. Elam is a part of Persia; but is taken for the whole of
   Persia, and on this account also the Persians are called Elamites. It
   is worthy of observation, that, when Isaiah foretold these things,
   there was no probability of war, and that he was dead a hundred years
   before there was any apprehension of this calamity. Hence it is
   sufficiently evident that he could not have derived his information on
   this subject from any other than the Spirit of God; and this
   contributes greatly to confirm the truth and certainty of the
   prediction.

   Besiege, O Mede. By commanding the Medes and Persians, he declares that
   this will not befall the Babylonians at random or by chance, but by the
   sure decree of God, in whose name, and not in that of any private
   individual, he makes the announcement. Coming forward therefore in the
   name of God, he may, like a captain or general, command his soldiers to
   assemble to give battle. In what manner God employs the agency of
   robbers and wicked men, has been formerly explained at the tenth
   chapter. [66]

   I have made all his groaning to cease. Some understand it to mean, that
   the groaning, to which the Babylonians had given occasion, ceased after
   they were subdued by the Medes and Persians; for by their tyrannical
   measures they had caused many to groan, which must happen when wicked
   and ungodly men possess rank and power. Others approach more closely,
   perhaps, to the real meaning of the Prophet, when they say, that "the
   groaning ceased," because the Babylonians experienced no compassion,
   having formerly shewn none to others. But I explain it more simply to
   mean, that the Lord was deaf to their groanings; as if he had said,
   that there would be no room for their groanings and lamentations,
   because having been cruel and barbarous, it was just that they should
   receive back the same measure which they had meted out to others.
   (Matthew 7:2.)

   3. Therefore are my loins, filled with pain. Here the Prophet
   represents the people as actually present, for it was not enough to
   have simply foretold the destruction of Babylon, if he had not
   confirmed the belief of the godly in such a manner that they felt as if
   the actual event were placed before their eyes. Such a representation
   was necessary, and the Prophet does not here describe the feelings of
   his own heart, as if he had compassion on the Babylonians, but, on the
   contrary, as we have formerly said, [67] he assumes, for the time, the
   character of a Babylonian. [68] It ought undoubtedly to satisfy our
   minds that the hidden judgments of God are held out to us, as in a
   mirror, that they may arouse the sluggishness of our faith; and
   therefore the Prophets describe with greater beauty and copiousness,
   and paint in lively colors, those things which exceed the capacity of
   our reason. The Prophet, thus expressing his grief, informs believers
   how awful is the vengeance of God which awaits the Chaldeans, and how
   dreadfully they will be punished, as we are struck with surprise and
   horror when any sad intelligence is brought to us.

   As the pangs of a woman that travaileth. He adds a stronger expression
   of grief, when he compares it to that of a woman in labor, as when a
   person under fearful anguish turns every way, and writhes in every part
   of his body. Such modes of expression are employed by the Prophets on
   account of our sluggishness, for we do not perceive the judgments of
   God till they be pointed at, as it were, with the finger, and affect
   our senses. We are warned to be on our guard before they arrive.

   4. My heart was shaken. Others render it not amiss, "my heart
   wandered;" for excessive terror moves the heart, as it were, out of its
   place. He declares how sudden and unlooked for will be the destruction
   of Babylon, for a sudden calamity makes us tremble more than one which
   has been long foreseen and expected. Daniel relates, that what Isaiah
   here foretells was accomplished, and that he was an eye-witness.
   Belshazzar had that night prepared a magnificent banquet, when the
   Persians suddenly rushed upon him, and nothing was farther from his
   expectation than that he would be slain. High delight was thus suddenly
   changed into terror. (Daniel 5:30.)

   5. Prepare the table. These verbs may be taken for participles; as if
   he had said, "While they were preparing the table and appointing a
   guard, while they were eating and drinking, sudden terror arose; there
   was a call to arms, Arise ye princes," etc.. But Isaiah presents lively
   descriptions, so as to place the actual event, as it were, before our
   eyes. Certainly Xenophon does not describe so historically the storming
   of the city; and this makes it evident that it was not natural
   sagacity, but heavenly inspiration, that taught Isaiah to describe so
   vividly events that were unknown. Besides, we ought to observe the time
   when these predictions were uttered; for at that time the kingdom of
   Babylon was in its most flourishing condition, and appeared to have
   invincible power, and dreaded no danger. Isaiah ridicules this vain
   confidence, and shews that this power will speedily be laid in ruins.

   Let it not be thought absurd that he introduces the watchmen as
   speaking; for although the siege had not shaken off the slothfulness of
   a proud and foolish tyrant so as to hinder him from indulging in gaiety
   and feasting, still there is no room to doubt that men were appointed
   to keep watch. It is customary indeed with princes to defend themselves
   by guards, that they may more freely and without any disturbance
   abandon themselves to every kind of pleasure; but the Prophet expressly
   mixes up the sentinels with the delicacies of the table, to make it
   more evident that the wicked tyrant was seized with a spirit of
   giddiness before he sunk down to drunken reveling. The king of Babylon
   was thus feasting and indulging in mirth with his courtiers, when he
   was overtaken by a sudden and unexpected calamity, not that he was out
   of danger, but because he disregarded and scorned the enemy. The day
   before it happened, it might have been thought incredible, for the
   conspiracy of Gobryas, and of that party which betrayed him, had not
   yet been discovered. At the time when Isaiah spoke, none would have
   thought that an event so extraordinary would ever take place.

   6. For thus hath the Lord said to me. The Prophet is commanded to set a
   watchman on the watchtower, to see these things at a distance; for they
   cannot be perceived by the eyes, or learned by conjecture. In order,
   therefore, that all may know that he did not speak at random, he
   declares that he foretells these things; for although they are unknown
   to men, and incredible, yet he clearly and distinctly knows them by the
   spirit of prophecy, because he is elevated above the judgment of men.
   This ought to be carefully observed; for we must not imagine that the
   prophets learned from men, or foresaw by their own sagacity, those
   things which they made known; and on this account also they were justly
   called "Seers." (1 Samuel 9:9.) Though we also see them, yet our sight
   is dull, and we scarcely perceive what is at our feet; and even the
   most acute men are often in darkness, because they understand nothing
   but what they can gather by the use of reason. But the prophets speak
   by the Spirit of God, as from heaven. The amount of what is stated is,
   that whosoever shall attempt to measure this prophecy by their own
   judgment will do wrong, because it has proceeded from God, and
   therefore it goes far beyond our sense.

   Go, appoint a watchman. It gives additional weight that he "appoints a
   watchman in the name of God." If it be objected, "You relate incredible
   things as if they had actually happened," he replies that he does not
   declare them at random; for he whom the prince has appointed to be a
   watchman, sees from a distance what others do not know. Thus Isaiah saw
   by the revelation of the Spirit what was unknown to others.

   7. And he saw a chariot. What he now adds contains a lively description
   of that defeat. Some think that it is told by the king's messenger.
   This is a mistake; for the Prophet, on the contrary, foretells what he
   has learned from the watchman whom he appointed by the command of God.
   Here he represents the watchman as looking and reporting what he saw.
   As if at the first glance he had not seen it clearly, he says that
   there is "a chariot," and afterwards observing more closely, he says
   that there is "a couple of horses" in the chariot. At first, on account
   of the novelty and great distance of the objects, the report given is
   ambiguous and confused; but afterwards, when a nearer view is obtained,
   they are better understood. There is no absurdity in applying to
   prophets or to divine visions what belongs to men; for we know that
   God, accommodating himself to our feeble capacity, takes upon himself
   human feelings.

   8. And he cried, A lion. "Having hearkened diligently with much heed,"
   at length he observes a lion. This is supposed to mean Darius who
   conquered and pillaged Babylon, as we learn from Daniel. (Daniel 5:28,
   31.)

   I stand continually. When the watchman says that he is continually on
   his watchtower by day and by night, this tends to confirm the
   prediction, as if he had said that nothing can be more certain than
   this vision; for they whom God has appointed to keep watch are neither
   drowsy nor dim-sighted. Meanwhile, by this example, he exhorts and
   stimulates believers to the same kind of attention, that by the help of
   the lamp of the word, they may obtain a distant view of the power of
   God.

   9. Babylon is fallen, is fallen. This shews plainly that it is not king
   Belshazzar's watchman who is introduced, for this speech would be
   unsuitable to such a character. The Prophet therefore makes known, by
   the command of God, what would happen. Now, this may refer either to
   God or to Darius, as well as to the watchman; and it makes little
   difference as to the meaning, for Darius, being God's servant in this
   matter, is not inappropriately represented to be the herald of that
   judgment. There would be greater probability in referring it to God
   himself; for Darius had no such thoughts when he overthrew the idols of
   the Babylonians. But the speech agrees better with the character of a
   guardian, as if an angel added an interpretation to the prophecy.

   And all the graven images of her gods. There is here an implied
   contrast between the living God and dead idols. This mode of
   expression, too, deserves notice, when he calls them "images of gods;"
   for the Babylonians knew, as all idolaters loudly proclaim, that their
   images are not gods. Yet they ascribed to them divine power, and when
   this is done, "the truth of God is changed into a lie," (Romans 1:25,)
   and not only so, but God himself is denied. But on this subject we
   shall afterwards speak more largely. Here we see, that by her
   destruction Babylon was punished for idolatry, for he assigns the
   reason why Babylon was destroyed. It was because the Lord could not
   endure that she should glory in her "graven images."

   10. My thrashing, and the son of my floor. [69] The wealth of that
   powerful monarchy having dazzled the eyes of all men by its splendor,
   what Isaiah foretold about its destruction might be reckoned fabulous.
   He therefore leads their minds to God, in order to inform them that it
   was God who had undertaken to destroy Babylon, and that it is not by
   the will of men, but by divine power, that such loftiness will fall to
   the ground. The "thrashing" and "the son of the floor" mean the same
   thing; for this mode of expression is frequently employed by Hebrew
   writers, who often repeat the same statement in different language.

   This passage ought to be carefully observed, that we may correct a vice
   which is natural to us, that of measuring the power of God by our own
   standard. Not only does our feebleness place us far below the wisdom of
   God; but we are wicked and depraved judges of his works, and cannot be
   induced to take any other view of them than of what comes within the
   reach of the ability and wisdom of men. But we ought always to remember
   his almighty power, and especially when our own reason and judgment
   fail us. Thus, when the Church is oppressed by tyrants to such a degree
   that there appears to be no hope of deliverance, let us know that the
   Lord will lay them low, and, by trampling on their pride and abasing
   their strength, will shew that they are his "thrashing-floor;" for the
   subject of this prediction was not a person of mean rank, but the most
   powerful and flourishing of all monarchies. The more they have exalted
   themselves, the more quickly will they be destroyed, and the Lord will
   execute his "thrashing" upon them. Let us learn that what the Lord has
   here given as a manifestation of inconceivable ruin, applies to persons
   of the same stamp.

   That which I have heard from the Lord of hosts. When he says that he
   has "heard it from the Lord of hosts," he sets a seal, as it were, on
   his prophecy; for he declares that he has not brought forward his own
   conjectures, but has received it from the Lord himself. Here it is
   worthy of our notice, that the servants of God ought to be fortified by
   this boldness to speak in the name of God, as Peter also exhorts, "He
   that speaketh, let him speak as the oracles of God." (1 Peter 4:11.)
   Impostors also boast of the name of God, but his faithful servants have
   the testimony of their conscience that they bring forward nothing but
   what God has enjoined. Observe, also, that this confirmation was highly
   necessary, for the whole world trembled at the resources of this
   powerful monarchy.

   From the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel. It is not without reason
   that he gives to God these two appellations. As to the former, it is
   indeed a title which always applies to God; but here, undoubtedly, the
   Prophet had his eye on the matter in hand, in order to contrast the
   power of God with all the troops of the Babylonians; for God has not a
   single army, but innumerable armies, to subdue his enemies. Again, he
   calls him "the God of Israel," because by destroying Babylon he shewed
   himself to be the defender and guardian of his people; for the
   overthrow of that monarchy procured freedom for the Jews. In short, all
   these things were done for the sake of the Church, which the Prophet
   has here in view; for it is not the Babylonians, who undoubtedly
   laughed at these predictions, but believers, whom he exhorts to rest
   assured that, though they were oppressed by the Babylonians, and
   scattered and tossed about, still God would take care of them.

   11. The burden of Dumah. It is evident from Genesis 25:14, that this
   nation was descended from a son of Ishmael, to whom this name was
   given, and hence his posterity are called Dumeans. [70] The cause of
   their destruction, which is here foretold, cannot be known with
   certainty, and this prophecy is obscure on account of its brevity. Yet
   we ought always to remember what I have formerly remarked, that it was
   proper that the Jews should be fortified against the dreadful
   stumbling-blocks which were approaching. When so many changes take
   place, particularly if the world is turned upside down, and if there is
   a rapid succession of events, we are perplexed and entertain doubts
   whether all things happen at random and by chance, or are regulated by
   the providence of God. The Lord therefore shews that it is he who
   effects this revolution, and renews the state of the world, that we may
   learn that nothing here is of long duration, and may have our whole
   heart and our whole aim directed to the reign of Christ, which alone is
   everlasting.

   Since therefore these changes were near at hand, it was proper that the
   Jews should be forewarned, that when the event followed, they should
   call them to remembrance, contemplate the wisdom of God, and strengthen
   their faith. Besides, there is no room to doubt that the Jews were
   harassed by various thoughts, when they saw the whole world shaken on
   all sides, and desired to have some means of avoiding those storms and
   tempests; for we always wish to be in safety and beyond the reach of
   danger. Some might have wished to find new abodes, that they might
   better provide for their own safety; but when storms raged on every
   hand, they were reminded to remain at home, and to believe that no
   safer habitation could anywhere be found than in the company of the
   godly.

   This example ought also to be a warning to many who separate themselves
   from the Church through fear of danger, and do not consider that a
   greater danger awaits them out of it. These thoughts might therefore
   distress the Jews, for we have seen in the eighth chapter that their
   minds were restless. [71] When they were thus tossed about in
   uncertainty, and fleeing to foreign nations, they would naturally lose
   heart; and this, I think, is the chief reason why the destruction of
   the Dumeans is foretold, namely, that the Jews might seek God with
   their whole heart, and that above all things they might commit to his
   care the safety of the Church. Let us therefore learn to keep ourselves
   within the Church, though she be afflicted by various calamities, and
   let us bear patiently the fatherly chastisements which are inflicted on
   children, instead of choosing to go astray, that we may drink the dregs
   which choke the wicked. (Psalm 75:8; Isaiah 51:17.) What shall become
   of strangers and reprobates, if children are thus chastised? (1 Peter
   4:17, 18.) Yet it is possible that the chosen people suffered some
   molestation from the people of God, when their neighbors assailed them
   on every side.

   Out of Seir. Mount Seir, as we learn from the book of Genesis, was a
   mountain of the Edomites. (Genesis 14:6; 32:3; 36:8, 9.) Under the name
   of this mountain he includes the whole kingdom. In this place he
   represents, as in a picture, those things which called for an earnest
   address.

   Watchman, what of the night? It is probable that the Edomites, who put
   the question, were not at a great distance from them, and that they
   were solicitous about the danger as one in which they were themselves
   involved. He introduces them as inquiring at the "watchman," not
   through curiosity, but with a view to their own advantage, what he had
   observed in "the night," just as when one has asked a question, a
   second and a third person follow him, asking the same thing. This is
   the meaning of the repetition, that the inquiry is made not by one
   individual only, but by many persons, as commonly happens in cases of
   doubt and perplexity, when every man is afraid on his own account, and
   does not believe what is said by others.

   12. The morning cometh. This means that the anxiety will not last
   merely for a single day, or for a short time, as if the watchman had
   replied, "What I tell you to-day, I will tell you again to-morrow; if
   you are afraid now, you will also be afraid to-morrow." It is a most
   wretched condition when men are tortured with anxiety, in such a manner
   that they hang in a state of doubt between death and life; and it is
   that dismal curse which the Lord threatens against wicked men by Moses,

   "Would that I lived till the evening; and in the evening, would that I
   saw the dawn!" (Deuteronomy 28:67.)

   The godly indeed are beset with many dangers, but they know that they
   and their life are committed to the hand of God, and even in the jaws
   of death they see life, or at least soothe their uneasy fears by hope
   and patience. But the wicked always tremble, and not only are tormented
   by alarm, but waste away in their sorrows.

   Return, come. These words may be explained in two ways; either that if
   they run continually, they will lose their pains, or in this way, "If
   any among you be more careful, let them go to Dumah, and there let them
   tremble more than in their native country, for nowhere will they be
   safe." But since God always takes care of his Church, nowhere shall we
   find a safer retreat, even though we shall compass sea and land.

   13. The burden upon Arabia. He now passes on to the Arabians, and
   foretells that they too, in their own turn, will be dragged to the
   judgment-seat of God; so that he does not leave unnoticed any of the
   nations which were known to the Jews. He declares that they will be
   seized with such fear that they will leave their houses and flee into
   the woods; and he states the direction in which they will flee, that
   is, to "Dedanim."

   14. To meet the thirsty bring waters. [72] He heightens the description
   of that trembling with which the Lord had determined to strike the
   Arabians in such a manner that they thought of nothing but flight, and
   did not take time even to collect those things which were necessary for
   the journey. Isaiah therefore declares that the Arabians will come into
   the country of Dedanim, empty and destitute of all things, and that
   they will not be provided with any food. On this account he exhorts the
   inhabitants to go out and meet them with bread and water, because
   otherwise they will faint through the want of the necessaries of life.

   I am aware that this passage is explained differently by some
   commentators, who think that the Prophet mocks at the Arabians, who had
   been cruel and barbarous towards the Jews; as if he had said, "How
   gladly you would now bring water to the thirsty!" But that exposition
   is too constrained. And yet I do not deny that they received the reward
   of their cruelty, when they ran hither and thither in a state of
   hunger. But the meaning which I have given is twofold, [73] that the
   Arabians in their flight will be so wretched that they will not even
   have the necessary supply of water, and they will therefore faint with
   thirst, if they do not quickly receive assistance; and he intimates
   that there will be a scarcity both of food and of drink. He calls on
   the neighbors to render assistance; not to exhort them to do their
   duty, but to state the fact more clearly; and he enjoins them to give
   their bread to them, not because it is deserved, but because they are
   suffering extreme want. Yet as it is founded on the common law of
   nature and humanity, the Prophet indirectly insinuates that the hungry
   and thirsty are defrauded of their bread, when food is denied to them.

   15. For they flee from the face of the swords. [74] He means that the
   calamity will be dreadful, and that the Arabians will have good reason
   for betaking themselves to flight, because the enemies will pursue them
   with arms and with swords, so that they will have no other way of
   providing for their safety than by flight. The reason why he foretells
   this defeat is plain enough; for it was necessary that the Jews should
   obtain early information of that which should happen long after, that
   they might learn that the world is governed by the providence of God
   and not by chance, and likewise that they should be taught by the
   example of others to behold God as the judge of all nations, wherever
   they turned their eyes. We do not know, and history does not inform us,
   whether or not the Arabians were enemies of the Jews. However that may
   be, it is certain that these things are spoken for the consolation of
   the godly, that they may behold the justice of God towards all nations,
   and may acknowledge that his judgment-seat is at Jerusalem, from which
   he will pronounce judgment on the whole world.

   16. For thus hath the Lord said to me. He adds that this defeat of the
   Arabians, of which he prophesied, is close at hand; which tended
   greatly to comfort the godly. We are naturally fiery, and do not
   willingly allow the object of our desire to be delayed; and the Lord
   takes into account our weakness in this respect, when he says that he
   hastens his work. He therefore declares that he prophesies of things
   which shall happen, not after many ages, but immediately, that the Jews
   may bear more patiently their afflictions, from which they know that
   they will be delivered in a short time.

   Yet a year according to the years of the hireling. Of the metaphor of
   "the year of the hireling," which he adds for the purpose of stating
   the matter more fully, we have already spoken. [75] It means that the
   time will not be delayed. The same comparison is used by heathen
   authors, where they intend to describe a day appointed and desired; as
   appears from that passage in Horace, "The day appears long to those who
   must render an account of their work." [76]

   17. And the residue of the archers. He threatens that this slaughter
   will not be the end of their evils, because if there be any residue in
   Arabia, they will gradually decrease; as if he had said, "The Lord will
   not merely impoverish the Arabians by a single battle, but will pursue
   to the very utmost, till all hope of relief is taken away, and they are
   utterly exterminated." Such is the vengeance which he executes against
   the ungodly, while he moderates the punishment which he inflicts on the
   godly, that they may not be entirely destroyed.

   Of the mighty men. He means warlike men and those who were fit to carry
   arms, and says, that although they escaped that slaughter, still they
   will be cut off at their own time. He formerly threatened similar
   chastisements against the Jews, but always accompanied by a promise
   which was fitted to alleviate their grief or at least to guard them
   against despair. It frequently happens that the children of God are
   afflicted as severely as the reprobate, or even with greater severity;
   but the hope of favor which is held out distinguishes them from the
   whole world. Again, when we learn that God visits on the wicked deadly
   vengeance, this is no reason why we should be immoderately grieved even
   at the heaviest punishments; but, on the contrary, we ought to draw
   from it this consolation, that he chastises them gently, and "does not
   give them over to death." (Psalm 118:18.)

   The God of Israel hath spoken it. The Prophet shews, as we have
   frequently remarked on former occasions, that we ought not only to
   acknowledge that these things happened by divine appointment, but that
   they were appointed by that God whom Israel adores. All men are
   sometimes constrained to rise to the acknowledgment of God, though they
   are disposed to believe in chance, because the thought that there is a
   God in heaven comes into their minds, whether they will or not, and
   that both in prosperity and in adversity; but then they imagine a Deity
   according to their own fancy, either in heaven or on earth. Since
   therefore irreligious men idly and foolishly imagine a God according to
   their own pleasure, the Prophet directs the Jews to that God whom they
   adore, that they may know the distinguished privilege which they enjoy
   in being placed under his guardianship and protection. Nor is it enough
   that we adore some God as governor of the world, but we must
   acknowledge the true God, who revealed himself to the fathers, and hath
   manifested himself to us in Christ. And this ought to be earnestly
   maintained, in opposition to the profane thoughts of many persons who
   contrive some strange and confused notion of a Deity, because they dare
   not openly deny God.

   tribe, perhaps the same now called Dumah Eljandil, on the confines of
   Arabia and Syria. In that case, Seir, which lay between Judah and the

   Isaiah Chapter 22:1-25

   1. The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that thou
   art wholly gone up to the house-tops?

   1. Onus vallis visionis. Quid tibi hic, (vel, nunc?) quia tu universa
   conscendisti super tecta?

   2. Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, a joyous city: thy
   slain men are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.

   2. Strepituum plena, urbs turbulenta, civitas exultans; interfecti tui
   non interfecti gladio, et non mortui in prælio.

   3. All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the archers: all
   that are found in thee are bound together, which have fled from far.

   3. Cuncti principes tui profugerunt parita ab arcu; vincti sunt. Omnes,
   inquam, in te reperti vincti sunt pariter, qui a longinquo fugerunt.

   4. Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labour
   not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my
   people.

   4. Propterea dixi, Desistite a me; amarus ero in fletu meo, ne
   contendatis me consolari super vastatione filiæ populi mei.

   5. For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity
   by the Lord God of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the
   walls, and of crying to the mountains.

   5. Quoniam dies perturbationis, et conculcationis, et anxietatis Domino
   Iehovæ exercituum in valle visionis, diruenti urbem, et clamor ad
   montem.

   6. And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir
   uncovered the shield.

   6. Atqui Elam portans pharetram in curru hominis, equitum, inquam, et
   Ceir nudans clypeum.

   7. And it shall come to pass, that thy choicest valleys shall be full
   of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the
   gate.

   7. Et fuit ut electio vallium tuarum repleta sit curribus, et equites
   instruendo instruerent ad portam.

   8. And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look in that
   day to the armour of the house of the forest.

   8. Et transtulit operimentum Iuda; et respexisti in die illa ad
   armaturam domus saltus.

   9. Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they are
   many; and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool:

   9. Et interruptiones civitatis David vidistis, quæ multæ erant; et
   collegistis aquas piscinæ inferioris.

   10. And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have
   ye broken down to fortify the wall.

   10. Et domos Ierusalem numerastis; et domos diruistis ad muniendum
   murum.

   11. Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old
   pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, neither had
   respect unto him that fashioned it long ago.

   11. Fossam quoque fecistis inter muros, aquis piscinæ veteris, et non
   respexistis ad fictorum ejus, et opificem ejus ab antiquo (vel, eminus)
   non vidistis.

   12. And in that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping, and to
   mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:

   12. Porro vocavit Dominus Iehova exercituum in die isto ad fletum et
   lamentum, ad calvitium et cincturam sacci.

   13. And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating
   flesh and drinking wine: let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we shall
   die.

   13. Et ecce gaudium et lætitia, occidere bovem, mactare ovem, edere
   carnes, et bibere vinum, comedere, inquam, et bibere; quia cras
   moriemur.

   14. And it was revealed in mine ears by the Lord of hosts, Surely this
   iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith the Lord God
   of hosts.

   14. Id revelatum est auribus Iehovæ exercituum, Si remittetur vobis hæc
   iniquitas, donec moriamini, dicit Dominus Iehova exercituum.

   15. Thus saith the Lord God of hosts, Go, get thee unto this treasurer,
   even unto Shebna, which is over the house, and say,

   15. Sic dicit Dominus Iehova exercituum, Vade, ingredere ad fautorem
   istum, ad Sabna præfectum domus.

   16. What hast thou here, and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed
   thee out a sepulchre here, as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on
   high, and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock?

   16. Quid tibi hic? et quis tibi hic? quod tibi hic excideris
   sepulchrum, sicut qui in excelso excidit sepulchrum suum, aut qui in
   rupe sculpit habitaculum sibi.

   17. Behold, the Lord will carry thee away with a mighty captivity, and
   will surely cover thee.

   17. Ecce Iehova traducet te traductione insigni, et operiendo operiet
   te.

   18. He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a
   large country: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy
   glory shall be the shame of thy lord's house.

   18. Convolvendo volvet te convolutione, quasi globam in terram
   longinquam manibus; ibi morieris; et ibi currus gloriæ tuæ ignominia
   domus domini tui.

   19. And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall he
   pull thee down.

   19. Et propulsabo te de statione tua, et de sede tua te expellet.

   20. And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant
   Eliakim the son of Hilkiah;

   20. Et erit in die illa: vocabo servum meum Eliakim, filium Helciæ.

   21. And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy
   girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand; and he shall be
   a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.

   21. Et induam eum vestibus tuis, et balteo tuo roborabo eum; et
   potestatem tuam tradam in manum ejus, et erit pater incolæ Ierusalem et
   domi Iuda.

   22. And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder: so
   he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall
   open.

   22. Et ponem clavem domus David super humerum ejus; aperiet, et nemo
   claudet; claudet, et nemo aperiet.

   23. And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be
   for a glorious throne to his father's house.

   23. Et figam eum veluti clavum in loco fideli; eritque in solium gloriæ
   domui patris sui.

   24. And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house,
   the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the
   vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons.

   24. Et suspendent ab eo omnem gloriam domus patris sui, nepotes et
   pronepotes, omnia vasa minora, a vasis craterarum ad cuncta vasa
   melodiarum.

   25. In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, shall the nail that is
   fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and
   the burden that was upon it shall be cut off: for the Lord hath spoken
   it

   25. In die illa, dicit Iehova exercituum, recedet clavus fixus in loco
   fideli, frangetur et cadet, et dissipabitur onus quod fuit super ipsum;
   quia Iehova loquutus est.


   1. The burden of the valley of vision. Isaiah again prophesies against
   Judea, which he calls the valley of vision. He gives this appellation
   to the whole of Judea rather than to Jerusalem, of which he afterwards
   speaks; but now in the preface he includes the whole of Judea. He
   appropriately calls it a "valley," for it was surrounded on all sides
   by mountains. It is a harsher view of the metaphor, which is adopted by
   some, that Jerusalem is called "a valley," because it was thrown down
   from its loftiness. The reason why he adds the words, of vision, is
   plain enough. The Lord enlightened the whole of Judea by his word; the
   prophets were continually employed in it, and that was the reason why
   they called them seers. (1 Samuel 9:9.) There is also an implied
   contrast here, for valleys have less light than open plains, because
   the height of the mountains intercepts the light of the sun. Now, this
   valley, he tells us, is more highly enlightened than those countries
   which were exposed on all sides to the sun. It was by the extraordinary
   goodness of God that this happened; for he means, that it was
   enlightened, not by the rays of the sun, but by the word of God.

   Besides, the Prophet unquestionably intended to beat down that foolish
   confidence with which the Jews were puffed up, because God had
   distinguished them above others by remarkable gifts. They abused his
   word and prophecies, as if by means of them they had been protected
   against all danger, though they were disobedient and rebellious against
   God. He therefore declares that visions will not prevent God from
   punishing their ingratitude; and he even aggravates their guilt by this
   mark of ingratitude, that amidst such splendor of heavenly doctrine
   they still continued to stumble like the blind.

   What hast thou here? or, What hast thou now? He now addresses
   Jerusalem; not that this defeat affects Jerusalem alone, but because
   the whole country thought it safe to take refuge under the shadow of
   the sanctuary which then existed, and to lead the Jews to reflect,
   since this befell a fortified city, what would become of other cities
   which had no means of defense. He asks in astonishment, "What does it
   mean that every person leaves his house and flies to the house-top for
   the purpose of saving his life?" Among the Jews the form of house-tops
   was different from what is now customary with us, and hence arose that
   saying of Christ,

   "What you have heard in the ear proclaim on the housetops." (Matthew
   10:27.)

   When the inhabitants of Jerusalem fled to the house-tops, they left
   their houses open to be a prey to enemies, and this was a proof that
   they were exceedingly afraid. It is likewise possible that they went up
   to the house-tops for the purpose of throwing down javelins and other
   weapons against the enemies, whose arrival not only terrified them, but
   made them flee in consternation, and yet they did not escape danger.

   2. Thou that art full of noises. He means that it was exceedingly
   populous; for where great multitudes of people are brought together,
   noise abounds; and therefore, amidst so crowded a population, there was
   less cause of fear. In order to make the representation still more
   striking, Isaiah has therefore added this circumstance, that instead of
   being, as they ought to have been, walls and bulwarks to defend the
   city, when there was no scarcity of men, they ignominiously turned
   their backs on the enemies, and fled to the tops of their houses. By
   these words he urges the Jews more strongly to consider the judgment of
   God; for when such overwhelming fear has seized the hearts of men, it
   is certain that God has struck them with trembling; as if he had said,
   "How comes it that you have not greater firmness to resist? It is
   because God pursues and chases you."

   These statements are taken from the writings of Moses, from which, as
   we have frequently remarked, the prophets borrow their instructions,
   but with this difference, that what Moses spoke in general terms they
   apply to the matter in hand.

   "The Lord shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies; thou
   shalt go out one way against them, and shalt flee seven ways before
   them. The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and
   astonishment of heart."
   (Deuteronomy 28:25, 28.)

   He reproaches the Jews for their distressed condition, and with good
   reason; for it was proper to press the accusation more closely home,
   that they might learn to ascribe to their sins and transgressions all
   the afflictions and sufferings that they endured. The Lord had promised
   that he would continually assist them; and when they are now left
   destitute, let them acknowledge that they do not deserve such
   assistance, and that God has cast them off on account of their
   rebelliousness. The Lord does not deceive or make false promises, but
   by their own fault those wretched persons have shut themselves out from
   his aid and favor; and this is still more strongly expressed by the
   question, What hast thou here? It means that God gave practical
   evidence that Jerusalem had been deprived of her protector and
   guardian; for this mode of expression denotes something strange and
   extraordinary.

   Thy slain men are not slain by the sword. To exhibit still more clearly
   the vengeance of God, he affirms that they who were slain there did not
   die bravely in battle. Thus he shews that all that they wanted was
   manly courage; for a timid and cowardly heart was a sure proof that
   they had all been forsaken by the Lord, by whose assistance they would
   have bravely and manfully resisted. He therefore does not mean that the
   defeat would be accompanied by shame and disgrace, but ascribes it to
   the wrath of God that they had not courage to resist; and
   unquestionably by this circumstance he beats down their foolish pride.

   3. All thy rulers are fled together. This verse has been interpreted in
   various ways. The fact is abundantly plain, but there is some
   difficulty about the words. As m (mem) signifies before and more than,
   some explain mrchvq (mErachOk) [77] to mean, "They fled before others,
   though they were situated in the most distant parts of the country, and
   were in greater danger." Others render it, "Although they were at a
   great distance from Jerusalem, still they did not cease to flee like
   men who are seized with terror, and never stop in their flight, because
   they continually think that the enemy is at their heels."

   But a more natural interpretation appears to me to be. They have fled
   from afar; that is, "they who have resorted to Jerusalem as a safe
   retreat will be seized by enemies and vanquished;" for Jerusalem might
   be regarded as the general protection of the whole of Judea, and
   therefore, when a war broke out, the inhabitants rushed to it from
   every quarter. While they looked upon their habitation in Jerusalem as
   safe, they were taken prisoners. Others suppose it to refer to the
   siege of Sennacherib. (2 Kings 18:13; 2 Chronicles 32:1.) But I cannot
   be persuaded to expound the passage in this manner, for he speaks of
   the destruction of Jerusalem. When it was besieged by Sennacherib, the
   Lord immediately delivered it; none were taken or made prisoners, and
   there was no slaughter of men. These events therefore happened long
   after the death of the Prophet, and sacred history relates them, and
   informs us that in that destruction even the rulers betook themselves
   to flight; but they derived no advantage from their flight, nor did
   Jerusalem afford them any defense, for they fell into the hands of
   their enemies.

   When he expressly mentions the rulers, this shews more strongly the
   shamefulness of the transaction, for they ought to have been the first
   to expose their persons for the safety of the people. They might be
   viewed as the shields which ought to have guarded and defended the
   common people. So long as Jerusalem kept its ground and was in a
   prosperous condition, these statements might be thought incredible, for
   it was a very strong and powerfully fortified city. But they chiefly
   boasted of the protection of God, for they thought that in some way God
   was bound to his "Temple;" and their pride swelled them with the
   confident hope that, though all should be leagued against it, no power
   and no armies could bring it down. (Jeremiah 7:4.) This prophecy might
   therefore be thought very strange, that they would have no courage,
   that they would betake themselves to flight, and that even in that
   manner they could not escape.

   4. Therefore I said. Here the Prophet, in order to affect more deeply
   the hearts of the Jews, assumes the character of a mourner, and not
   only so, but bitterly bewails the distressed condition of the Church of
   God. This passage must not be explained in the same manner as some
   former passages, in which he described the grief and sorrow of foreign
   nations; but he speaks of the fallen condition of the Church of which
   he is a member, and therefore he sincerely bewails it, and invites
   others by his example to join in the lamentation. What has befallen the
   Church ought to affect us in the same manner as if it had befallen each
   of us individually; for otherwise what would become of that passage?
   "The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up." (Psalm 69:9.)

   I will be bitter in my weeping. [78] He does not mourn in secret, or
   without witnesses; first, because he wishes, as I have already said, to
   excite others by his example to lamentation, and not to lamentation
   only, but much more to repentance, that they may ward off the dreadful
   judgment of God against them, which was close at hand, and henceforth
   may refrain from provoking his displeasure; and secondly, because it
   was proper that the herald of God's wrath should actually make evident
   that what he utters is not mockery.

   Because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people. That he expresses
   the feelings of his own heart may be inferred from what he now
   declares, that he is bitterly grieved "on account of the daughter of
   his people." Being one of the family of Abraham, he thought that this
   distress affected his own condition, and intimates that he has good
   grounds for lamentation. By a customary mode of expression he calls the
   assembly of his people a daughter. Hence it ought to be observed, that
   whenever the Church is afflicted, the example of the Prophet ought to
   move us to be touched (sumpatheia) with compassion, if we are not
   harder than iron; for we are altogether unworthy of being reckoned in
   the number of the children of God, and added to the holy Church, if we
   do not dedicate ourselves, and all that we have, to the Church, in such
   a manner that we are not separate from it in any respect. Thus, when in
   the present day the Church is afflicted by so many and so various
   calamities, and innumerable souls are perishing, which Christ redeemed
   with his own blood, we must be barbarous and savage if we are not
   touched with any grief. And especially the ministers of the word ought
   to be moved by this feeling of grief, because, being appointed to keep
   watch and to look at a distance, they ought also to groan when they
   perceive the tokens of approaching ruin.

   The circumstance of his weeping publicly tended, as we have said, to
   soften the hearts of the people; for he had to deal with obstinate men,
   who could not easily be induced to lament. There is a passage that
   closely resembles it in Jeremiah, who bewails the miserable and wasted
   condition of the people, and says, that through grief "his heart
   fainteth," [79] (Jeremiah 4:31;) and in another passage, "O that my
   head were full of waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I
   might bewail the slain of my people!" (Jeremiah 9:1.) When the prophets
   saw that they labored in vain to subdue the obstinacy of the people,
   they could not avoid being altogether overwhelmed by grief and sorrow.
   They therefore endeavored, by their moving addresses, to soften hard
   hearts, that they might bend them, if it were at all possible, and
   bring them back to the right path.

   5. It is a day of trouble. He again declares that the Lord is the
   author of this calamity, and that the Jews may not gaze around in all
   directions, or wonder that their enemies prevail against them, he
   pronounces that they are fighting against God. Though this doctrine is
   frequently taught in Scripture, still it is not superfluous, and cannot
   be so earnestly inculcated as not to be forgotten when we come to
   practice. The consequence is, that we are not humbled in the presence
   of our Judge, and that we direct our eyes to outward remedies rather
   than to God, who alone could cure our distresses. He employs the word
   day, as is usual in Scripture, to signify an appointed time; for when
   God winks at the transgressions of men, he appears to make some
   abatement of the claims of his rank, which, however, he may be said to
   receive back again at the proper and appointed time.

   In the valley of vision. It is not without good reason that he again
   calls it "the valley of vision," for the Jews believed that they would
   be protected against every calamitous event, because the Lord shone on
   them by the word. But having ungratefully rejected his instruction,
   they vainly trusted that it would be of avail to them; and indeed the
   Lord punishes the unbelief of men, not only out of the Church, but
   within the Church itself; and not only so, but he begins his
   chastisement at the Church, so that we must not abuse the gifts of God,
   or vainly glory in his name. (1 Peter 4:17.)

   And crying to the mountain. [80] This may refer either to God or to the
   Babylonians, or even to the exiles themselves. Conquerors raise a cry
   for the sake of increasing terror, and the vanquished either utter what
   is fitted to awaken compassion, or give vent to their grief by
   lamentation. The singular number may be taken for the plural, or rather
   it denotes that part of the city in which the temple was situated. Both
   meanings will agree well with the context, and it makes little
   difference whether we say that the enemies cried to Mount Zion, in
   order to encourage each other, or that, while they were destroying and
   plundering the city, a cry was heard in the neighboring mountains, or
   that the citizens themselves caused their lamentations to resound to
   the mountains which surrounded the plain of Judea. [81]

   6. But Elam carrying the quiver. Here commentators think that the
   discourse proceeds without any interruption, and that he makes known to
   the Jews the same judgment which he formerly proclaimed. But when I
   examine the whole matter more closely, I am constrained to differ from
   them. I think that the Prophet reproaches the Jews for their obstinacy
   and rebellion, because, though the Lord had chastised them, they did
   not repent, and that he relates the history of a past transaction, in
   order to remind them how utterly they had failed to derive advantage
   from the Lord's chastisements. Such then is the manner in which these
   statements ought to be separated from what came before. First, he
   foretold those things which would come on the Jews, and now he shews
   how justly they are punished, and how richly they deserve those sharp
   chastisements which the Lord inflicts on them; for the Lord had
   formerly called them to repentance, not only by words, but by deeds,
   and yet no reformation of life followed, though their riches were
   exhausted, and the kingdom weakened, but they obstinately persisted in
   their wickedness. Nothing therefore remained but that the Lord should
   miserably destroy them, since they were obstinate and refractory.

   The copulative v (vau) I have translated But, which is the meaning that
   it frequently bears. Those who think that the Prophet threatens for a
   future period, preserve its ordinary meaning, as if the Prophet, after
   having mentioned God, named the executioners of his vengeance. But I
   have already given the exposition which I prefer, and the context will
   make it still more clear, that I had good reasons for being of that
   opinion.

   When he speaks of the "Elamites" and the "Cyrenaeans," this applies
   better, I think, to the Assyrians than to the Babylonians; for although
   those nations had never make war against the Jews by troops under their
   own command, yet it is probable that they were in the pay of the
   Assyrian king, and that they formed part of his army while he was
   besieging Jerusalem. We have already remarked that, taking a part for
   the whole, by the "Elamites" are meant the eastern nations.

   And Kir making bare the shield [82] By Kir he undoubtedly means the
   inhabitants of Cyrenaica. [83] Because they were (peltastai)
   shieldsmen, he says that they "laid bare the shield;" for when they
   enter the field of battle, they draw the shields out of their sheaths.

   7. And the choice of the valleys [84] was full of chariots. I do not
   find fault with the translation given by some interpreters, "in a
   chariot of horsemen," but I have chosen rather to translate literally
   the words of the Prophet; for I think that he means "a military
   chariot." At that time they made use of two kinds of chariots, one for
   carrying baggage, and another for the field of battle. Here he means
   those chariots in which the horsemen rode.

   Had it been a threatening, it would have been proper to translate it in
   the future tense, "And it shall be;" but as the words which immediately
   follow are in the past tense, and as there is reason to believe that
   the Prophet is relating events which have already taken place, I have
   not hesitated to make this beginning agree with what follows. "The
   choice of the valleys" means "the choicest valleys." He reminds the
   Jews of those straits to which they were reduced when the enemies were
   at their gates. They ought at that time to have sought help from God;
   but those wretched people became more strongly alienated from God, and
   more shamefully manifested their rebellion, which shewed them to be men
   utterly abandoned, and therefore he reproaches them with this hardened
   obstinacy.

   8. And he took away the covering of Judah. He shews in what distress of
   mind the Jews were when they were so closely besieged. Some refer this
   verb to God, and others to the enemy; but I rather think it ought to be
   taken indefinitely, for by a mode of expression frequently used in the
   Hebrew language, "he took away," means that "the covering of Judah was
   taken away." By the word covering almost all think that either the
   Temple or God himself is meant, in whose name the Jews falsely boasted.
   But I interpret it more simply as denoting the armory, in which, as a
   secret place, they kept the instruments of war. He calls it a
   "covering," because they were not exposed to public view, but were
   concealed in a more sacred place. In short, he describes what commonly
   happens in a season of great alarm, because at such a time men run to
   arms, and the instruments of war, which had been formerly concealed,
   are brought forward.

   And thou didst look in that day to the armory of the house of the
   forest. This latter clause agrees with what has been remarked, that
   they sought out, on such an occasion, every place which contained the
   means of arming themselves for a case of extreme urgency, the
   instruments of war having lain long concealed during peace. Sacred
   history informs us, that this "house of the forest" was built by
   Solomon, in order to contain the armory of the whole kingdom. [85] (1
   Kings 7:2.) The change of person, thou didst look, does not obscure the
   meaning, but rather confirms what I have already remarked, that the
   Prophet relates how eagerly the Jews at that time made every
   preparation for defending the city.

   9. And you have seen the breaches. He proceeds with his narrative, for
   during prosperity and peace no one cares about bulwarks or instruments
   of war. It is necessity alone that arouses men and makes them active;
   peace and quietness make us indolent and cowardly. So long as they
   thought that they were far from danger, they disregarded the breaches
   of the wall; but when a report of war arose, they began to be anxious
   about them, and to make arrangements for preventing the entrance of the
   enemy.

   Of the city of David. By "the city of David," he means the interior
   part of the city; for, like many other cities which we see, the city
   was divided into two parts. The whole of Jerusalem was surrounded by
   walls and ramparts; but the interior part was more strongly fortified,
   and was called "the city of David." The Temple was afterwards
   fortified, in consequence of which the city might be said to consist of
   three parts. Isaiah means that the Jews had nearly despaired as to the
   safety of the whole city, when they withdrew to the inmost and best
   fortified part of it; and indeed it is evident from sacred history,
   that everything was in a desperate condition. Hence also we may infer,
   that the prophecies were not collected in a regular order, and that
   those who drew them up in one volume paid no attention to the
   arrangement of dates.

   The waters of the lower pool. He adds, that water was collected for
   necessary purposes, that the besieged might not be in want of it, and
   that the pool served for cisterns.

   10. And you numbered the houses of Jerusalem. He means that the city
   was closely examined on all sides, that there might not be a house or
   building which was not defended. Others think that the houses were
   numbered, that they might have a supply of watchmen. But the former
   interpretation is preferable, and is confirmed by what the Prophet
   afterwards adds, that the houses were thrown down for the purpose of
   rebuilding the walls of the city. This is commonly neglected in the
   time of peace, and the houses of private individuals are often built on
   the very walls, and, on that account, must be thrown down in the time
   of war, to supply the means of fighting and of repelling the enemy, and
   also lest, by means of houses so near the wall, secret communications
   with the enemy should be maintained.

   11. You made also a ditch. The first clause of this verse relates to
   the former subjects; for he means that they were reduced to the last
   necessity, and that the great approaching danger struck them with
   terror, so that they adopted every method in their power for defending
   themselves against the enemy.

   And you have not looked to its maker. This second clause reproves them
   for carelessness, because they had given their whole attention to
   earthly assistance, and had neglected that which is of the greatest
   importance. Instead of resorting first of all to God, as they ought to
   have done, they forgot and despised him, and directed their attention
   to ramparts, and ditches, and walls, and other preparations of war; but
   their highest defense was in God. What I said at first is now more
   evident, that the Prophet does not foretell the destruction of the
   Jews, but declares what they have experienced, in order to shew how
   justly the Lord was angry with them, because they could not be amended
   or reformed by any chastisement. The alarming dangers to which they
   were exposed ought to have warned them against their impiety and
   contempt of God; but those dangers have made them still more obstinate.
   Though there is hardly any person so obstinate as not to be induced by
   adversity, and especially by imminent dangers, to bethink himself, and
   to consider if they have justly befallen him, if he has offended God
   and provoked his wrath against himself; yet the Prophet says, that
   there was not one of the Jews who remembered God in the midst of such
   distresses, and that therefore God justly ceased to take any concern
   about them.

   Hence infer that it is a token of extreme and desperate wickedness,
   when men, after having received chastisements or afflictions, are not
   made better. We ought, first, to follow God and to render to him
   cheerful obedience; and secondly, when we have been practically warned
   and chastised, we ought to repent. And if stripes do us no good, what
   remains but that the Lord shall increase and double the strokes, and
   cause us to feel them heavier and heavier till we are hurled down to
   destruction? For it is vain to apply remedies to a desperate and
   incurable disease. This doctrine is highly applicable to our own times,
   in which so many strokes and afflictions urge us to repentance. Since
   there is no repentance, what remains but that the Lord shall try to the
   very utmost what can be done until he destroy us altogether?

   To its maker. By these words he indirectly acknowledges that God does
   not blame our eagerness to repel the enemy and to guard against
   dangers; but that he blames the vain confidence which we place in
   outward defences. We ought to have begun with God; and when we
   disregard him, and resort to swords and spears, to bulwarks and
   fortifications, our excessive eagerness is justly condemned as treason.
   Let us therefore learn to flee to God in imminent dangers, and to
   betake ourselves, with our whole heart, to the sure refuge of his name.
   (Proverbs 18:10.) When this has been done, it will be lawful for us to
   use the remedies which he puts into our hand; but all will end in our
   ruin if we do not first commit our safety to his protection.

   He calls God the maker and fashioner of Jerusalem, because there he had
   his dwelling, and wished that men should call upon him. (1 Kings 9:3.)
   As Jerusalem was a lively image of the Church, this title belongs also
   to us, for in a peculiar manner God is called the Builder of the
   Church. (Psalm 132:13, 14.) Though this may relate to the creation of
   the whole world, yet the second creation, by which he raises up from
   death, (Ephesians 2:1,) regenerates, and sanctifies us, (Psalms 110:3,)
   is peculiar to the elect, the rest have no share in it. This title does
   not express a sudden but a continual act, for the Church was not at
   once created that it might afterwards be forsaken, but the Lord
   preserves and defends it to the last. "Thou wilt not despise the work
   of thy hands," says the Psalmist. (Psalms 138:8.) And Paul says,

   "He who hath begun a good work in you will perform it till the day of
   Christ." (Philippians 1:6.)

   This title contains astonishing consolation, for if God is the maker,
   we have no reason to fear if we depend on his power and goodness. But
   we cannot look to him unless we are endued with true humility and
   confidence, so that, being divested of all haughtiness and reduced to
   nothing, we ascribe the glory to him alone. This cannot be, unless we
   can also trust that our salvation is in his hand, and are fully
   convinced that we shall never perish, even though we be surrounded by a
   thousand deaths. It was an aggravation of their baseness, that the
   Lord's election of that city, which had been established by so many
   proofs, could not arouse the Jews to rely on the protection of God. As
   if he had said, What madness is it to think of defending the city when
   you despise him who made it!

   From a distance, or long ago. The Hebrew word denotes either distance
   of place or length of time. If we refer it to place, the meaning will
   be, that the Jews are doubly ungrateful, because they have not beheld
   the Lord even at a distance. Here it ought to be observed, that we
   ought to look to God not only when he is near, but also when he appears
   to be at a very great distance from us. Now, we think that he is
   absent, when we do not perceive his present aid, and when he does not
   instantly supply our wants. In short, he shews what is the nature of
   true hope; for it is a carnal and gross looking at God, when we do not
   perceive his providence unless by visible favor, since we ought to
   ascend above the heavens themselves. Strictly and truly, no doubt, the
   Lord is always present, but he is said to be distant and absent with
   respect to us. This must be understood therefore to refer to our
   senses, and not to the fact itself; and therefore, although he appear
   to be at a distance during those calamities which the Church endures,
   still we ought to elevate our minds towards him, and arouse our hearts,
   and shake off our indolence, that we may call on him.

   But the other meaning is equally admissible, that they did not look to
   God who created his Church, not yesterday or lately, but long ago, and
   who had proved himself to be her Maker during many ages. He is
   therefore called the ancient Maker of his Church, because if the Jews
   will apply their thoughts and careful search to the long succession of
   ages, they will perceive that he is the perpetual preserver of his
   workmanship; and this makes their ingratitude the less excusable.

   12. And the Lord of hosts called. The wicked obstinacy of the people is
   exhibited by the Prophet with additional aggravations. What left them
   altogether without excuse was the fact, that while they were exposed to
   so great dangers, they despised the godly remonstrances of the
   prophets, and rejected the grace of God, when he wished to heal and
   restore them. It is a proof of consummate depravity, when men have so
   completely laid aside all feeling that they fearlessly despise both
   instruction and chastisements, and obstinately "kick against the
   pricks," (Acts 9:5,) and this makes it evident that they have been
   "given over to a reprobate mind." (Romans 1:28.)

   When he says, that "the Lord called" them, this may be explained in two
   ways; for although the Lord does not speak, still he calls loudly
   enough by stripes and chastisements. Let it be supposed that we are
   destitute of all Scripture, of prophets, teachers, and advisers, still
   he instructs us by distresses and afflictions, so that we may state, in
   a few words, that every chastisement is a call to repentance. But,
   unquestionably, the Prophet intended to express something more, namely,
   that in despising godly warnings, they did not scruple to treat with
   scorn God's fatherly invitation.

   In that day. There is great weight also in mentioning the day of
   affliction, when danger threatened them, for they were admonished at
   the same time by the word and by strokes. The signs of God's anger were
   visible, the prophets uttered incessant cries, and still they became no
   better.

   To baldness and girding with sackcloth. When he mentions sackcloth and
   baldness, [86] he employs the signs themselves to describe repentance;
   for repentance does not consist in sackcloth or haircloth, [87] or
   anything outward, but has its place in the heart. Those who sincerely
   repent are displeased with themselves, hate sin, and are affected with
   such a deep feeling of grief, that they abhor themselves and their past
   life; but as this cannot be done without, at the same time, making
   itself known by confession before men, on this account he describes the
   outward signs by which we give evidence of our conversion. Now, these
   things were at that time cast away among the Jews, when they made
   public declarations of repentance. The Prophet therefore means that
   they were called to repentance, to humble themselves before God, and to
   exhibit the evidences of repentance before men. Of themselves, indeed,
   the signs would not be sufficient, for repentance begins at the heart;
   and Joel gives warning to that effect,

   "Rend your hearts, and not your garments." (Joel 2:13.)

   Not that he wished signs to be laid aside, but he shewed that they are
   not sufficient, and that of themselves they are not acceptable to God.

   Hence infer what is our duty, when the tokens of God's anger are
   visible to us. We ought to declare publicly our repentance, not only
   before God, but also before men. The outward ceremonies, indeed, are of
   little consequence, and we are not commanded to wear sackcloth or to
   pull out our hair; but we must practice honestly and sincerely what is
   actually meant by these signs, disapprobation and confession of our
   guilt, humility of the heart, and reformation of the life. If we do not
   confess that we are guilty, and that we deserve punishment, we shall
   not return to a state of favor with God. In short, as culprits allow
   their beards to grow, and wear tattered clothes, in order to affect the
   hearts of the judges, so we ought to betake ourselves as suppliants to
   the mercy of God, and make a public declaration of our repentance.

   But here we ought also to observe the usefulness of outward signs of
   repentance; for they serve as spurs to prompt us more to know and abhor
   sin. In this way, so far as they are spurs, they may be called causes
   of repentance; and so far as they are evidences, they may be called
   effects. They are causes, because the marks of our guilt, which we
   carry about us, excite us the more to acknowledge ourselves to be
   sinners and guilty; and they are effects, because, if they were not
   preceded by repentance, we would never be induced to perform them
   sincerely.

   13. And, behold, joy and gladness. The Prophet does not here find fault
   with joy viewed in itself; for we see that Paul exhorts the godly to
   true joy, the "joy" which is "in the Lord," (Philippians 4:4;) but now
   he censures the joy which is opposite to that sadness which commonly
   springs from repentance, of which Paul also speaks. (2 Corinthians
   7:10.) No man can be under the influence of repentance and of a sincere
   feeling of the wrath of God, without being led, by the grief which
   accompanies it, willingly to afflict himself. The joy which is opposite
   to this grief is therefore sinful, because it proceeds from brutish
   indifference, and is justly blamed, since the Lord curses it. (Luke
   6:25.)

   Slaying oxen and killing sheep. From what has been said, it is easy to
   see the reason why he censures them for "slaying oxen and killing
   sheep." These things are not in themselves sinful, and are not
   displeasing to God; but as fasting is a part of a solemn declaration of
   repentance, which we make before men, so to slay cattle for feasting,
   when we ought to fast, is a proof of obstinacy and contempt of God; for
   in this way men despise God's threatenings, and encourage themselves in
   their crimes.

   Such is the statement which Isaiah intended to make in general terms.
   But it is absurd in the Papists to think of drawing from it an
   approbation of abstinence from eating flesh. Why do they not also
   include what the Apostle adds about wine? They are so far from
   abstaining from the use of wine, that they freely indulge in drinking
   it, as a compensation for the want of flesh. But let us pass over these
   absurdities. Isaiah does not absolutely condemn the use of flesh or the
   drinking of wine, but he condemns the luxury and wantonness by which
   men are hardened in such a manner that they obstinately set aside God's
   threatenings, and treat as false all that the prophets tell them.

   This ought to be carefully observed, for we do not always wear
   sackcloth and ashes; but we cannot have true repentance without making
   it manifest by the fruits which it must unavoidably produce. In short,
   as he had described repentance by its signs, so he marks out obstinacy
   by its signs; for as by fasting and other outward acts we testify our
   repentance, so by feasting and luxury we give proofs of an obstinate
   heart, and thus provoke more the wrath of God, in a similar manner to
   what we read about the days of Noah. (Genesis 6:5; Matthew 24:38, 39;
   Luke 17:27.) After having described intemperance and luxury in general
   terms, he particularly mentions eating and drinking, in which the Jews
   indulged to such an extent as if they had been able, in some measure,
   to combat the wrath of God, and to obliterate the remembrance of his
   threatening.

   For to-morrow we shall die. This clause shews plainly enough why the
   Prophet complained so loudly about eating flesh and drinking wine. It
   was because all the threatenings uttered by the prophets were turned by
   them into a subject of jesting and laughter. It is supposed that Paul
   quotes this passage, when, in writing to the Corinthians, he uses
   nearly the same words. (1 Corinthians 15:32.) But I am of a different
   opinion; for he quotes the opinion of the Epicureans, who lived for the
   passing day, and gave themselves no concern about eternal life, and
   therefore thought that they should follow their natural disposition,
   and enjoy pleasures as long as life lasted. Isaiah, on the other hand,
   relates here the speeches of wicked men, who obstinately ridiculed the
   threatenings of the prophets, and could not patiently endure to be told
   about chastisements, banishment, slaughter, and ruin. They employed the
   words of the prophets, and in the midst of their feasting and revelry,
   turned them into ridicule, saying, in a boasting strain, "To-morrow we
   shall die. If the prophets tell us that our destruction is at hand, let
   us pass the present day, at least, in cheerfulness and mirth."

   Thus, obstinate minds cannot be struck with any terror, but, on the
   contrary, mock at God and the prophets, and give themselves up more
   freely to licentiousness. It certainly was frightful madness when,
   through indignation and wrath, they quoted with bitter irony the words
   which not only ought to have affected their minds, but ought to have
   shaken heaven and earth. Would that there were not instances of the
   same kind in the present day! For whenever God threatens, the greater
   part of men either vomit out their bitterness, or sneeringly ridicule
   everything that has proceeded from God's holy mouth.

   14. This is revealed. [88] As if he had said, "Do you think that you
   can escape punishment for your wantonness, when God calls you to
   repentance?" It might be thought that here the Prophet says nothing
   that is new; for undoubtedly all things are known to God. But he adds
   this for the purpose of shaking off the indolence of men, who never
   would rise so fiercely against God, if they did not think that they
   could deceive him; for whosoever knows that God is his witness, must
   also acknowledge that God is his judge. Hence it follows that wicked
   men, in their wantonness, rob God of his power; and therefore it is not
   without reason that they are summoned to his tribunal, that they may
   know that they must render an account to him.

   If this iniquity shall be forgiven you till you die. He adds a dreadful
   threatening, that this wickedness shall never be forgiven. In the
   Hebrew language, the conditional particle, if, contains a denial, as if
   the Lord had said, "Do not think that I am true, or that I have any
   divine perfections, if I do not take vengeance on so great wickedness."
   The reason why the Jews, in their oaths, reserve something which is not
   expressed, is to accustom us to deeper reverence in this matter; for we
   entreat God to be our Judge and avenger if we speak falsely, and
   therefore we ought to restrain ourselves, so as not to make oaths at
   random. Here Isaiah states generally, that nothing is so displeasing to
   God as impenitence, by which, as Paul says, (Romans 2:5,) we "heap up
   for ourselves the treasures of God's wrath," and shut out all hope of
   pardon.

   15. Thus saith the Lord. This is a special prediction against a single
   individual; for, having spoken of the whole nation, he turns to Shebna,
   whom he will afterwards mention. (Isaiah 37:2.) To this person the
   Prophet gives two titles, that of "scribe" or "chancellor," and that of
   "steward of the house," for while in this passage he calls him
   "steward," in the thirty-seventh chapter he calls him "scribe." This
   has led some to think that, at the time of this prediction, he had
   resigned his office as steward, and that Eliakim was put in his room.
   But this is uncertain, though the words of the Prophet, in reference to
   Shebna himself, lead us to conclude that he cherished wicked envy,
   which led him to attempt to degrade Eliakim from his rank. Nor is it
   improbable that this prediction was uttered, when Sennacherib's army
   was discomfited, and Jerusalem was saved in a miraculous manner. (2
   Kings 19:35; Isaiah 37:36.) During the interval, many things might have
   happened which are now unknown to us; and it is not improbable that
   this treacherous scoundrel, having obtained the highest authority, made
   an unjust use of it to the injury of Eliakim. It is evident, from the
   history of the Book of Kings, that Shebna was a "scribe" or
   "secretary," and one of high rank, such as we now call chancellor.

   There is greater difficulty about the word skn, (sOchen.) Some think
   that it means "treasurer," because skn (sachan) signifies to store up;
   but, as he elsewhere calls him "chancellor," I think it is not probable
   that he was treasurer. Besides, the Prophet shews plainly enough that
   his office as governor was such as allowed others to have scarcely any
   share of authority along with him. Such a rank could not belong to a
   treasurer, and therefore I think that the Prophet means something else.
   As skn (sachan) sometimes signifies "to abet," and "to foment," skn
   (sOchen) may here mean "an abettor," or, as we commonly say, "an
   accomplice." It is certain that this Shebna had communications with the
   enemy, and was a cunning and deceitful person; for he cherished a
   concealed friendship with the Egyptians and Assyrians, and held
   treacherous communications with them, so as to provide for his own
   safety in any event that might arise, and to maintain his authority.

   Others think that skn (sOchen) is a word denoting the country to which
   he belonged, and that he was called a Sochnite from the city of which
   he was a native; for he is said to have been an Egyptian. I certainly
   do not reject that opinion, but I prefer the former; for he abetted
   both sides, and thought that, by his cunning, he would be preserved,
   even though everything should be turned upside down.

   The particle hzh, (hazzeh,) this, is evidently added in contempt. It is
   as if he had said, "That cunning man, ready for all shifts,
   (panourgos,) who abets various parties, who curries favor on all
   sides." In this sense skn (sOchen) is used (1 Kings 1:2) when it
   relates to a maid who was about to be brought to the aged king in order
   to cherish him. Yet, if it be thought preferable to understand it as
   meaning a hurtful and injurious person, I do not object, for the word
   signifies also "to impoverish."

   16. What hast thou here? Shebna had built a sepulcher at Jerusalem, as
   if he were to live there continually, and to die there. The Prophet
   therefore asks why he built a splendid and costly sepulcher in a lofty
   and conspicuous place, as is commonly done by those who wish to
   perpetuate the memory of their name in the world. He appears to glance
   at the ambition of a foreigner and a stranger in longing to be so
   magnificently buried out of his country, and yet eagerly joining with
   enemies for the destruction of Judea. What could have been more foolish
   than to erect a monument in that country for whose ruin he was
   plotting? And therefore he adds --

   17. Behold, the Lord will carry thee away. As if he had said, "Thou
   shalt be cast out of that place into a distant country, where thou
   shalt die ignominiously." gvr (gEbEr) is commonly translated as in the
   genitive case; that is, "with the casting out of a man thou shalt be
   cast out." Again, gvr (gEbEr) denotes not an ordinary man, but a strong
   and brave man, and thus it comes to mean, "with a mighty and powerful
   casting out." Others render it in the vocative case, "O man!" as if he
   were addressing Shebna in mockery, "O illustrious man, who so proudly
   vauntest of thy greatness, who thinkest that thou art some hero!" But
   the former reading will be more appropriate. Yet here also commentators
   disagree; for, besides the exposition which I have mentioned, another
   is brought forward, that men will be carried to a greater distance than
   women. But I rather think that he alludes to the pride of Shebna, who
   had built so splendid a sepulcher, in order that his memory, like that
   of some distinguished man, might be handed down to posterity. "Thou
   wishest to be renowned after thy death: I will ennoble thee in a
   different manner. By a remarkable transportation will I remove thee to
   a foreign and distant country, where thou shalt be buried in an
   extraordinary manner."

   First, on the word skn (sOchen) it is proper to remark how much God is
   displeased with a false and deceitful heart; for there is nothing which
   God more earnestly recommends to us than simplicity. He is called a
   ruler, because, being placed above others, he was likely to be dazzled
   by the luster of his present greatness, as happens to those who, elated
   and puffed up by their success, dread no adversity, as if they had been
   placed beyond the reach of all danger. The Lord threatens that he will
   be the judge of such persons. Here it also deserves notice, that Isaiah
   could not, without making himself the object of strong dislike, utter
   this prediction, especially when addressed to a man of such an elevated
   station and so haughty; and yet he must not refuse this office, but
   must approach and threaten this man, as God had commanded him.

   As to the sepulcher, we know that solicitude about burying the dead is
   not wholly condemned; for although "the want of burial," as one
   remarks, "is of little importance, yet the desire of being buried is
   natural to man, and ought not to be entirely disregarded." He does not
   blame him, therefore, for wishing to be buried, but for his ambition in
   building a tomb, by which he shewed his eagerness to obtain vain and
   empty renown. But there is another circumstance connected with Shebna
   that must be observed; for, having wished to deliver the city into the
   hands of the Assyrians by treachery, he thought that he would reign
   permanently. He hoped that the Assyrians, if they were successful,
   would bestow on him the government of the kingdom as the reward of his
   treachery, and that, if they were defeated, he would permanently retain
   his rank and authority.

   But this will appear more clearly from the words themselves, What hast
   thou here? He was a foreigner, and as such he could honestly become
   united to the people of God; but, being a traitor and a foreigner, he
   had no right to that city or country which the Lord had specially
   assigned to his own people. Isaiah therefore asks, "Of what country art
   thou? Though thou hast no connection with the people of God by blood or
   relationship, dost thou wish not only to reign in this country during
   thy life, but to procure for thyself a settled abode in it after thou
   art dead? Wilt thou betray us to the Assyrians, and drive out the
   actual possessors, that thou, who art a foreigner, mayest enjoy that
   country, of which not even an inch belongs to thee?"

   Hence infer that God is highly displeased with that ambition by which
   men endeavor to obtain undying renown in the world, instead of being
   satisfied with those honors which they enjoy during their life. They
   wish to be applauded after death, and in some measure to live in the
   mouth of men; and although death sets aside everything, they foolishly
   hope that their name will last through all ages. But God punishes their
   haughtiness and presumption, and causes those things which they wished
   to be the records of their glory to become their disgrace and shame.
   Either their memory is abhorred, so that men cannot see or hear
   anything connected with them without utter loathing, or he does not
   even permit them to be laid in their graves, but sends them to gibbets
   and to ravens, of which we read many instances in history, (Esther
   7:10,) and we have seen not a few in our own times.

   Whenever I read this passage, I am forcibly reminded of a similar
   instance, resembling it indeed more closely than any other, that of
   Thomas More, who held the same office as Shebna; for it is well known
   that he was Lord Chancellor to the king of England. Having been a very
   bitter enemy of the gospel, and having persecuted good men by fire and
   sword, he wished that on this account his reputation should be
   extensive, and his wickedness and cruelty permanently recorded. He
   therefore ordered the praises of his virtue to be inscribed on a tomb
   which he had caused to be built with great cost and splendor, and sent
   his epitaph, which he had drawn up, to Basle, to Erasmus, along with a
   palfrey which he gave him as a present, to get it printed. He was so
   desirous of renown, that he wished to obtain during his life the
   reputation and praises which he hoped to enjoy after his death. Among
   other applauses the most conspicuous was, that he had been a very great
   persecutor of the Lutherans, that is, of the godly. [89] What happened?
   He was accused of treason, condemned, and beheaded; and thus he had a
   gibbet for his tomb. Do we ask more manifest judgments of God, by which
   he punishes the pride, the unbounded eagerness for renown, and the
   blasphemous vaunting, of wicked men? In this inveterate enemy of the
   people of God, not less than in Shebna, we ought undoubtedly to
   acknowledge and adore God's overruling providence.

   Another circumstance worthy of notice is, that this Shebna was a
   foreigner. Thus, all the tyrants and enemies of the people of God,
   though they be foreigners, would wish to cast out the actual lords of
   the soil, that they alone might possess the land; but at length the
   Lord drives them out, and strips them of all possession, so that they
   do not even continue to have a tomb. [90] There are innumerable
   instances in history. True, this does not always happen; but the
   instances which the Lord holds out to us, ought to lead our thoughts
   farther to consider his judgments against tyrants and wicked men, who
   wished to be applauded and celebrated, but are distinguished by some
   remarkable kind of death, so that their infamy becomes universally
   known. Thus, the renown of that sepulcher which Shebna had built is
   indirectly contrasted with the ignominy which quickly followed it.

   18. Turning he will turn thee. [91] Isaiah continues the same
   discourse, in which he ridiculed the pride of Shebna, who had bestowed
   so much cost on building a sepulcher. This statement is connected with
   the first clause of the former verse; for, as he formerly said "He will
   remove thee by an extraordinary removal," so he now says, "He will toss
   thee as a ball into an open plain." By this comparison he means that
   nothing will prevent the Lord from casting him out into a distant
   country, though he thinks that his power is firmly established; and
   since he had been so careful about his sepulcher, and had given orders
   about it, as if he had been certain as to his death, Isaiah declares
   that he will not die in Jerusalem, but in a foreign country, to which
   he shall be banished.

   The chariot of thy glory. Under the word chariot he includes all the
   fame and rank of Shebna; as if he had said that disgrace would be his
   reputation among foreigners. Thus, the Lord ridicules the mad ambition
   of those who look at nothing but the world, and who judge of their
   happiness by the glory of fading and transitory objects.

   The shame of thy lord's house. He calls it "the shame of" the royal
   "house," either because he had polluted that holy place which might be
   regarded as the sanctuary of the Lord, or because Hezekiah had judged
   ill in elevating him to that station. That the mask of his high rank
   might not screen him from this prediction, the Prophet expressly
   states, that the office which he holds aggravates his guilt and renders
   him more detestable. Let princes, therefore, if they do not wish to
   expose themselves and their houses to reproaches, learn to act with
   judgment in appointing men to hold office.

   19. And I will cast thee out. He says nothing new, but concludes the
   former prediction. Though in the next verse he will again mention
   Shebna, yet now he gives a brief summary of what has been already said.
   Shebna thought that he had a fixed abode in Jerusalem, so that,
   whatever might happen, he thought that he could not be driven or
   removed from it. But the Lord threatens that he will cast him out, and
   will banish him to a distant country. Thus, the Lord frequently
   overturns the thoughts of the wicked, (Psalm 33:10,) who, relying on
   their cunning and dexterity, toss about public affairs according to
   their own pleasure. The change of person shews that the Prophet speaks
   sometimes in his own name, and sometimes in the name of God.

   20. And it shall come to pass in that day. It is uncertain at what time
   Eliakim was substituted in the room of Shebna; for we shall see, in the
   thirty-seventh chapter, that Eliakim was steward of the king's house
   when Shebna was chancellor. Whether or not any change took place during
   the interval cannot with certainty be affirmed; yet it is probable, as
   I lately hinted, that through the stratagems of this wicked man,
   Eliakim was afterwards driven from his office, and that Shebna, after
   having triumphed, was punished for his frauds which had been detected,
   and, having been driven or banished from Judea, fled to the Assyrians,
   and there received the reward of his treachery. In like manner does it
   frequently happen to traitors, who, when they cannot fulfill their
   engagements, are hated and abhorred by those whom they have deceived;
   for, having been bold and rash in promising, they must be discovered to
   be false and treacherous.

   The Jews allege that at last he was torn in pieces on account of his
   treachery, but no history supports that statement. Leaving that matter
   doubtful, it is certain that he was cast out or banished, and that he
   ended his days in a foreign country, and not at Jerusalem. It is
   probable that, after his banishment, Eliakim was again placed in his
   room.

   I will call. It is certain that all princes and magistrates are called
   by the Lord, even though they be wicked and ungodly; for "all authority
   is from God," as Paul affirms. (Romans 13:1.) But here the Prophet
   speaks of a peculiar calling, by which the Lord manifests his goodness
   towards his people, when he appoints such persons to be his servants,
   that it may be known that God governs by them; and they, on the other
   hand, are well aware of the purpose for which they have been appointed
   by God, and faithfully discharge the office assigned to them. Shebna
   had indeed been called for a time, but it was that he might be God's
   scourge; for nothing was farther from his thoughts than to obey God.
   Eliakim was a different kind of person; for he acknowledged himself to
   be a servant of God, and obeyed the holy calling.

   I will call, means, therefore, "I will give a sign to my servant, that
   he may know that it is I who have raised him to that honorable rank."
   There is in this case a peculiar relation between the master and the
   servant, which does not apply to ungodly men when they obey their own
   inclination and wicked passions; but this man acknowledged the Lord and
   sincerely obeyed him. Lastly, this mark distinguishes the true servant
   of God from a wicked and hypocritical person, who had risen to honor by
   wicked practices.

   21. And I will clothe him. He now explains more fully what he had
   briefly noticed in the former verse, that it was only by the purpose of
   God that Shebna was deposed, in order that Eliakim might succeed him.
   It is true, indeed, that all the changes that happen in the world are
   directed by the providence of God; for he "girds kings with a girdle,"
   as we are told in the book of Job, "and ungirds them, according to his
   pleasure." (Job 12:18.) A witty saying was at one time current about
   the Roman emperors, "that they were theatrical kings;" because, as
   players, who perform their parts in the theater, no sooner have laid
   aside the rank of a king, than they presently become poor mechanics; so
   the emperors, after having been thrown down from their lofty station,
   were speedily hurried to a disgraceful punishment. And yet it is
   certain that those insurrections did not take place by chance, or
   merely through the designs of men, or by military forces, but by the
   purpose of God, which directed the whole. But the Prophet declares,
   that there is this peculiarity in the case of Shebna, that his
   deposition will be a clear proof of the vengeance of God, and that the
   restoration of Eliakim will be regarded as a lawful form of government.

   With thy robes and with thy girdle. By the robes and girdle are meant
   the badges of the magistrates' office. The girdle was an emblem of
   royalty, and the chief magistrates undoubtedly wore it as an honorable
   distinction. At Rome, also, the prætors wore this badge. Job says, that
   God ungirds kings when he deprives them of their royal rank. (Job
   12:18.) These things were foretold by the Prophet, that all might not
   only see clearly in this instance the providence of God, and
   acknowledge his purpose, but might perceive that this wicked man, who
   had raised himself improperly and by unlawful methods, was justly
   deposed.

   He shall be Father. Wicked magistrates are indeed appointed by God, but
   it is in his anger, and because we do not deserve to be placed under
   his government. He gives a loose rein to tyrants and wicked men, in
   order to punish our ingratitude, as if he had forsaken or ceased to
   govern us. But when good magistrates rule, we see God, as it were, near
   us, and governing us by means of those whom he hath appointed. The
   Prophet means that Eliakim will perform the part of a father, because
   he has been endued with the Spirit of God. At the same time he reminds
   all godly persons that they will have good reasons for wishing the
   government of Eliakim, because it tends to the general advantage of the
   Church.

   By the appellation father, he shews what is the duty of a good
   magistrate. The same thing has been taught by heathen writers, that "a
   good king holds the place of a father;" and when they wished to flatter
   those who crushed the commonwealth by the exercise of tyranny, nature
   suggested to them to call the tyrants by the honorable title of
   "fathers of their country." In like manner, philosophers, when they say
   that a family is the picture of a kingdom, shew that a king ought to
   hold the place of a father. This is also proved by the ancient titles
   given to kings, such as "Abimelech," (Genesis 20:2, 8,) that is, "my
   father the king," and others of the same kind, which shew that royal
   authority cannot be separated from the feelings of a father. Those who
   wish to be regarded as lawful princes, and to prove that they are God's
   servants, must therefore shew that they are fathers to their people.

   22. And the key of the house of David. [92] This expression is
   metaphorical, and we need not spend much time, as some do, in drawing
   from it an allegorical meaning; for it is taken from an ordinary custom
   of men. The keys of the house are delivered to those who are appointed
   to be stewards, that they may have the full power of opening and
   shutting according to their own pleasure. By "the house of David" is
   meant "the royal house." This mode of expression was customary among
   the people, because it had been promised to David that his kingdom
   would be for ever. (2 Samuel 7:13; Psalm 132:11, 12.) That is the
   reason why the kingdom was commonly called "the house of David."

   The key is put in the singular number for keys. Though "keys" are
   usually carried in the hands, yet he says that they are laid on the
   shoulders, [93] because he is describing an important charge. Yet
   nothing more is meant than that the charge and the whole government of
   the house are committed to him, that he may regulate everything
   according to his pleasure; and we know that the delivering of keys is
   commonly regarded as a token of possession.

   Some commentators have viewed this passage as referring to Christ, but
   improperly; for the Prophet draws a comparison between two men, Shebna
   and Eliakim. Shebna shall be deprived of his office, and Eliakim shall
   succeed him. What has this to do with Christ? For Eliakim was not a
   type of Christ, and the Prophet does not here describe any hidden
   mystery, but borrows a comparison from the ordinary practice of men, as
   if the keys were delivered to one who has been appointed to be steward,
   as has been already said. For the same reason Christ calls the office
   of teaching the word, (Matthew 16:19,) "the keys of the kingdom of
   heaven;" so that it is idle and foolish to spend much time in
   endeavoring to find a hidden reason, when the matter is plain, and
   needs no ingenuity. The reason is, that ministers, by the preaching of
   the word, open the entrance into heaven, and lead to Christ, who alone
   is "the way." (John 14:6.) By the keys, therefore, he means here the
   government of the king's house, because the principal charge of it
   would be delivered to Eliakim at the proper time.

   23. And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place. The particle of
   comparison must here be supplied, and therefore I have inserted in the
   text the word as. By n'mn, (nEEman,) faithful, he means what is "firm
   and sure." The original idea of the word is "truth;" for where "truth"
   is, there firmness and certainty are found; [94] and therefore Hebrew
   writers employ the word "truth" to denote what is firm and certain.
   Isaiah employs an elegant metaphor, from which godly magistrates, who
   are few in number, ought to draw large consolation. They may conclude
   that not only has God raised them to that honorable rank, but they are
   confirmed and established, as if they had been fixed by his hand. And
   indeed, where the fear of the Lord dwells, there the stability, and
   power, and authority of kings, as Solomon says, are established by
   justice and judgment. (Proverbs 16:12; 25:5; 29:14.)

   This consolation ought to be of advantage to princes, not only that
   they may meet all danger courageously, but likewise that they may
   firmly and resolutely proceed in their office, and not turn aside on
   any account, or shrink from any danger. But there are very few who can
   actually relish this doctrine. Almost all are like Jeroboam, (1 Kings
   12:28,) and think that religion should yield to them, and, so far as
   they imagine, that it will be of service to them, follow it, or rather
   bend and change it for their own convenience. Their last thought is
   about God and religion; and we need not wonder if they are always in
   doubt about their own affairs, and are scarcely ever at rest; for they
   do not direct their thoughts to him from whom all authority proceeds.
   (Romans 13:1.) Hence springs treachery, hence springs cruelty,
   covetousness, violence, and frauds and wrongs of every kind, in which
   the princes of the present day indulge with less restraint and with
   greater impudence than all others. Yet there are some in whom we see
   what is here said of Eliakim. The Lord guards and upholds them, and
   blesses that regard to equity and justice which he had bestowed upon
   them. If the Lord permits even tyrants for a time, because they have
   some appearance of regular government, what shall happen when a prince
   shall endeavor, to the utmost of his power, to defend justice and
   judgment, and the true worship of God? Will he not be still more
   confirmed and established by him who is the continual guardian of
   righteousness?

   24. And they shall hang upon him. It is as if he had said that Eliakim
   would be fully qualified for discharging his duties, and would not be
   indolent in his office. Hence we infer that God does not exalt princes
   to honor, in order that they may live in indolence or gratify their own
   passions. The office of a prince is very labourious, if he discharges
   it properly, and if he do not copy the unmeaning countenances of those
   who imagine that they have been raised to that honor, that they may
   live in splendor and may freely indulge in every kind of luxury. If a
   prince wish to discharge his office in a proper manner, he must endure
   much toil. It must not be thought that the comparison of a nail is
   inapplicable to princely government, since it denotes an office full of
   activity and cares; and we know that metaphors do not apply at all
   points, but we ought to observe the purpose for which they are
   introduced.

   All the glory of his father's house, [95] the grandchildren and
   great-grandchildren. [96] The expression, "his father's house," leaves
   no room to doubt that Eliakim was of royal blood; and therefore by his
   successors I understand not only those who were nearly related to him,
   but the whole family of David. He will have the charge of all that
   shall be in the king's house. By adding grandchildren, he likewise
   shews that this princely government will be of long duration, that it
   will not only last during the life of one individual, but will also
   extend to his successors. [97] For good princes are useful not only to
   their own age, but also to posterity, to whom they leave good laws,
   salutary regulations, and the traces of good government; so that their
   successors, even though they be wicked men, are ashamed to give
   themselves up all at once to abandoned wickedness, and, even against
   their will, are compelled through shame to retain something that is
   good. He shews that this will be the case with Eliakim, whose
   government will be so righteous that even posterity shall reap
   advantage from it.

   The smaller vessels. [98] Metaphorically it denotes that there will be
   uniform justice, or equal laws, as the phrase is; and it is as if he
   had said, "He will not only support the nobles, but will likewise
   attend to the interests of the lowest rank." The more rarely this is
   found in a prince, so much higher praise does he deserve than if he
   favored none but the rich and powerful; for these can guard and protect
   themselves, but the poor and feeble lie open as a prey to the attacks
   of others, and there is hardly any one that pleads their cause.

   To all vessels of music. [99] By vessels the Hebrew writers denote
   instruments of all kinds, and the meaning is very extensive. When he
   speaks of musical [100] vessels, he follows out what he had said in a
   single word; for it serves to explain the word qtn, (katan,) little; as
   if he had said that there would be nothing so small, or minute, or
   insignificant, that he would not take charge of it.

   25. In that day. It might be thought that this is inconsistent with
   what he had formerly said; but he no longer speaks of Eliakim, for he
   returns to Shebna, who was about to be cast down from his rank, as
   Isaiah had said. But for this, it might have been thought that there
   was no way by which Eliakim could arrive at that honor, but by the
   deposition of Shebna, who had arranged his matters so well, that no
   person thought it possible that he could be driven from his position.
   Yet though he has fortified himself by many defences, and thinks that
   he is at a great distance from all danger, still he shall be deprived
   of his office, and Eliakim shall be placed in his room.

   In a sure place. When he calls it "a sure place," this must be
   understood with respect to men; for men judge that what is defended on
   all sides will be of long duration; but God casts it down with the
   smallest breath. It was only by way of concession that he called it "a
   sure place." Hence it ought to be inferred how foolishly men boast, and
   rely on their greatness, when they have been exalted to a high rank of
   honor; for in a very short time they may be cast down and deprived of
   all honor.

   And the burden that was upon it shall be cut off. When wicked men are
   ruined, all who relied on their authority must also be ruined; and
   indeed it is in the highest degree reasonable that they who were united
   by the same bond of crimes, and who aided this wicked man as far as lay
   in their power, should share in the same punishment. It is difficult
   for those who place themselves under the protection of wicked men, and
   employ all their influence in behalf of them, not to be also partakers
   of their crimes; and if they were guiltless of crime, (which seldom, or
   rather, we may say, never happens,) still they are justly punished on
   this ground, that they have placed their trust on them as a very sure
   defense, and have depended wholly on their will and authority.

   office, either sacred or civil." -- Lowth ^FT350 "To comprehend how the
   key could be borne on the shoulder, it will be necessary to say
   somewhat of the form of it; but, without entering into a long
   disquisition, and a great deal of obscure learning, concerning the
   locks and keys of the ancients, it will be sufficient to observe, that
   one sort of keys, and that probably the most ancient, was of
   considerable magnitude, and, as to the shape, very much bent and
   crooked. Homer, Odyss. 21:6, describes the key of Ulysses's store-house
   as eukampes, of a large curvature; which Eustathius explains by saying
   it was drepanoeides, in shape like a reap-hook. The curve part was
   introduced into the key-hole, and, being properly directed by the
   handle, took hold of the bolts within, and moved them from their
   places. We may easily collect from this account, that such a key would
   lie very well upon the shoulder; that it must be of some considerable
   size and weight, and could hardly be commodiously carried otherwise.
   Ulysses's key was of brass, and the handle of ivory; but this was a
   royal key; the more common ones were probably of wood." -- Lowth ^FT351
   "Ce mot est deduit de verité, laquelle est tousjours accompagnee de
   fermeté et asseurance;" -- "This word is derived from truth, which is
   always accompanied by firmness and certainty." ^FT352 "In ancient
   times, and in the eastern countries, as the way of life, so the houses
   were much more simple than ours at present. They had not that quantity
   and variety of furniture, nor those accommodations of all sorts with
   which we abound. It was convenient and even necessary for them, and it
   made an essential part in the building of a house, to furnish the
   inside of the several apartments with sets of spikes, nails, or large
   pegs, upon which to dispose of, and hang up, the several moveables and
   utensils in common use, and proper to the apartment. These spikes they
   worked into the walls at the first erection of them -- the walls being
   of such materials that they could not bear their being driven in
   afterwards; and they were contrived so as to strengthen the walls, by
   binding the parts together, as well as to serve for convenience. Sir
   John Chardin's account of this matter is this, They do not drive with a
   hammer the nails that are put into the eastern walls; the walls are too
   hard, being of brick; or if they are of clay, too mouldering; but they
   fix them in the brick-work as they are building. They are large nails
   with square heads like dice, well-made, the ends being so bent as to
   make them cramp-irons. They commonly place them at the windows and
   doors, in order to hang upon them, when they like, veils and curtains.'
   (Harmer, Obser. 1 p. 191.) And we may add, that they were put in other
   places too, in order to hang up other things of various kinds; as it
   appears from this place of Isaiah, and from Ezekiel 15:3, who speaks of
   a pin, or nail, to hang any vessel thereon." -- Lowth ^FT353 "The
   offspring and the issue." -- Eng. Ver. ^FT354 "Mais s'estendra jusqu' a
   ceux qui viendront long temps apres;" "But will extend to those who
   shall live long afterwards." ^FT355 "Here follow the names of utensils
   hung up in an eastern house, concerning which we must needs be
   uncertain. The meaning of the whole figure is, Eliakim shall be the
   support of all ranks in the state, of the meanest people as well as the
   highest." -- Stock ^FT356 "Even to all the vessels of flagons, (or,
   instruments of violins.)" -- Eng. Ver. ^FT357 "The old interpretation
   of nvlym (nEbulim) as denoting musical instruments," says Professor
   Alexander, "though justified by usage, is forbidden by the context."

   Isaiah Chapter 23:1-18

   1. The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid
   waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of
   Chittim it is revealed to them.

   1. Onus Tyri. Ululate, naves Tharsis; quia devastatio facta est, ut non
   sit domus, non sit commeatus e terra Cittim. Revelatum est hoc eis.

   2. Be still, ye inhabitatnts of the isle; thou whom the merchants of
   Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.

   2. Tacete incolæ insularum: negotiator Sidonis, trajicientes mare, qui
   te replebant.

   3. And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, is
   her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.

   3. In aquis multis semen Nili, messis fluminis fruges ejus; et fuit
   emporium gentium.

   4. Be thou ashamed, O Zidon; for the sea hath spoken, even the strength
   of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do
   I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.

   4. Erubesce, Sidon; quia dixit mare, fortitudo maris, dicens, Non
   parturivi, neque peperi, neque educavi adolescentes, neque extuli
   virgines.

   5. As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely pained at
   the report of Tyre.

   5. Simul atque rumor pervenerit ad Ægyptios, dolebunt secundum rumorem
   Tyri.

   6. Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.

   6. Transite in Tharsis; ululate, habitatores insularum.

   7 Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? Her own
   feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.

   7. An hæc vobis exultans? a diebus antiquis vetustas ejus. Ducent eam
   pedes ejus, ut peregrinetur in terram longinquam.

   8. Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose
   merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honourable of the
   earth?

   8. Quis cosultavit hoc super Tyrum coronantem? cujus negotiatores sunt
   Principes, cujus institores nobiles terræ?

   9. The Lord of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory,
   and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth.

   9. Iehova exercituum ita decrevit ad profanandam superbiam omnium
   magnificorum, ut vilipendat omnes gloriosos terræ.

   10. Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: there is
   no more strength.

   10. Transi instar fluminis e terra tua ad filiam Tharsis, quia non
   amplius cingulum.

   11. He stretched out his hand over the sea; he shook the kingdoms: the
   Lord hath given a commandment against the merchant-city, to destroy the
   strongholds thereof.

   11. Manum suam posuit super mare, concussit regna. Iehova mandavit
   super Canaan ut enervet robur ejus.

   12. And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin,
   daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shalt thou
   have no rest.

   12. Et ait, Non adjicies ultra ut exultes, ubi oppressa fueris, virgo
   filia Sidon. Surge, ut transeas in Cittim. Atqui etiam illic non erit
   tibi requies.

   13. Behold the land of the Chaldeans: this people was not, till the
   Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up
   the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; and he brought
   it to ruin.

   13. Ecce terra Chaldæorum, hic non fuit populus, Assur fundavit eam
   deserti incolis; erexerunt arces ejus; excitarunt palatia ejus; redegit
   eam in vastitatem.

   14. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.

   14. Ululate, naves Tharsis; quia vastata est fortitudo vestra.

   15. And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten
   seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of
   seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot.

   15. Accidet in die illa, ut sit in oblivione Tyrus septuaginta annis,
   secundum dies regis unius; a fine septuaginta annorum erit Tyro quasi
   canticum meretricis.

   16. Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been
   forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be
   remembered.

   16. Sume citharam, circui urbem, meretrix oblivioni tradita, suavem fac
   melodiam, multiplica carmen, ut in memoriam revoceris.

   17. And it shall come to pass, after the end of seventy years, that the
   Lord will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and shall commit
   fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the
   earth.

   17. Erit ergo a fine septuaginta annorum, ut visitet Iehova Tyrum; et
   tunc redibit ad mercedem suam, fornicabiturque cum omnibus regnis terræ
   quæ sunt super terram.

   18. And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the Lord: it
   shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for
   them that dwell before the Lord, to eat sufficiently, and for durable
   clothing.

   18. Sed (tandem) erit negotiatio ejus et merces ejus sancta Iehovæ; non
   reponetur neque recondetur; sed negotiatio ejus (addicta) erit iis qui
   habitabant coram Iehovæ, ut comedant ad satietatem, et habeant densum
   operimentum.


   1. The burden of Tyre. Tyre was very wealthy, and highly celebrated,
   both on account of the variety and extent of its commercial intercourse
   with all nations, and on account of the flourishing colonies which
   sprang from it: Carthage, which was the rival of the Roman Empire,
   Utica, Leptis, Cadiz, and other towns, which also sent every year a
   present to Tyre, by which they acknowledged that they looked on Tyre as
   their mother. Isaiah threatens its destruction, because it had been
   hostile to the people of God, as we may infer from what is said by
   Ezekiel; for we ought carefully to attend to the cause of the
   destruction, because it was the design of the Prophet to shew that God
   testifies his fatherly regard to his people by opposing all her
   enemies. (Ezekiel 26:2.) Some think that this refers to the storming of
   Tyre by Alexander, who took it with great difficulty. But the argument
   on which they rely, that Isaiah mentions Chittim, [101] has little
   force. By that name the Hebrew writers unquestionably denote the
   Macedonians, but under this word they likewise include other nations,
   such as the Greeks, and the countries that were beyond the sea.
   Nebuchadnezzar employed in that siege not only his own soldiers, but
   also foreigners, whom he brought from Greece and other places. It is
   for a reason altogether different, as we shall immediately see, that he
   mentions the Greeks, namely, that henceforth they will not take their
   ships to Tyre for the sake of carrying on merchandise.

   But from the conclusion of this chapter I draw an argument for a
   contrary opinion, for Isaiah speaks of the restoration of Tyre, and it
   was never restored after having been stormed by Alexander. Besides,
   when I compare Ezekiel's words with those of Isaiah, I think that I see
   one and the same prediction. Now, he does not speak of Alexander, but
   of Nebuchadnezzar; and I cannot doubt that it must be explained in that
   manner. Not only so, but in the days of Ezekiel and Isaiah that city
   was under the dominion of a king, but historians relate that, when it
   was stormed by Alexander, it had been brought to the form of a
   republic. And if we consider the object of the prophecy, we shall be
   sufficiently confirmed in this opinion, for his aim is to comfort the
   Jews by threatening that the inhabitants of Tyre, by whom they had been
   oppressed, will not pass unpunished. For it would have been highly
   inconsistent that the Lord should punish other nations, and that this
   nation, which had been not less hostile, should escape punishment
   altogether, or be punished five hundred years afterwards. Every
   conjecture, therefore, leads us to this conclusion, that we should
   expound this passage as relating to Nebuchadnezzar.

   Howl, ye ships of Tarshish. He employs various figures of speech,
   according to his custom, in illustrating the ruin of Tyre, in order to
   obtain greater credit to the prediction; for a plain narrative would
   have been ineffectual, or would not have exerted a powerful influence
   on minds naturally dull and sluggish, and therefore he sets before
   their eyes a lively portrait. This calamity, he declares, will be very
   grievous, because it will be felt even in distant countries. He bids
   the "ships howl," because, when Tyre has been destroyed, they will have
   nothing to do. The ships of the Cilicians are particularly mentioned by
   him, because, being neighbors, they traded often and extensively with
   the inhabitants of Tyre; and Cilicia is called by the Hebrews
   "Tarshish." It was impossible that there should not have arisen great
   inconvenience to that country at the destruction of Tyre; not only
   because commerce ceased for a time, but also because the articles of
   merchandise were carried off, and there was a disturbance of commercial
   relations [102] as usually happens when the fortunes of rich men have
   been overthrown.

   That there may be no entering in from the land of Chittim. What I have
   translated "that there maybe no entering in," is explained by some to
   signify, that there may be no house "into which you can enter," but I
   think that I have faithfully conveyed the Prophet's meaning. And yet he
   does not mean that the Cilicians or the Greeks will be hindered from
   entering, but that they will not hold intercourse with Tyre as they
   were formerly accustomed to do, because it will not be, as formerly, a
   mart of nations.

   Those who think that the Prophet speaks of the defeat accomplished by
   Alexander, separate this clause of the verse "from the land of Chittim"
   from what goes before, and connect it thus, "from the land of Chittim
   it was revealed to them." But, on the contrary, I join it differently
   in this way, "From not going from the land of Chittim;" that is, that
   the Greeks may no more enter as they were formerly accustomed to do. By
   the word "Chittim," he means both the Greeks and the western nations;
   as if he had said "There will be an end put to commerce with the
   Greeks, so that they will no longer take their ships thither." Under
   this designation he includes also the inhabitants of Cyprus, [103]
   Sicily, and Italy, and other nations.

   This was revealed to them. These words may be understood to refer both
   to the Greeks and to the inhabitants of Tyre. If they refer to the
   inhabitants of Tyre, the meaning will be, "When the report of the ruin
   of the city shall reach them, they will put an end to their wonted
   voyages, for they will avoid that harbour as they would avoid a rock;"
   and this is the meaning which I more readily adopt. Yet I do not reject
   the other interpretation, that the Prophet confirms his prediction, as
   we commonly speak of a thing that is certain, "Let this be regarded as
   addressed to you."

   2. Be silent, ye inhabitants of the islands. This is intended to place
   in a more striking light the ruin of Tyre. There is a change of number
   in the word island; for although he uses the singular number, yet he
   means the islands of the Mediterranean sea, and the countries beyond
   the sea, especially the neighbors who frequently performed voyages to
   Tyre, and traded with it. He enjoins on them silence and stillness,
   because they will perform no more voyages to Tyre. He bids them "be
   silent" like persons who are stunned, on account of the grievous
   calamity which has befallen them, so that they do not even venture to
   open their mouth; for it was impossible that the nations who traded
   there should not feel it to be a heavy stroke, when a mercantile city
   like this was ruined, just as at the present day Venice or Antwerp
   could not be destroyed without inflicting great injury on many nations.

   The merchants of Sidon. He mentions the inhabitants of Sidon in an
   especial manner, not only on account of their vicinity, but because
   they had a common origin. Sidon was highly celebrated, but greatly
   inferior to Tyre. Situated on the sea-shore, it was two hundred
   furlongs [104] distant from Tyre, and appeared both to be so near it,
   and to be so closely connected with it by trade, that the poets
   frequently took Tyre for Sidon, and Sidon for Tyre. The Sidonians,
   therefore, were unquestionably greater gainers than others by imports
   and exports, and also by sales and merchandise, in consequence of being
   so near, and trading with it continually; for the wealth of Tyre
   overflowed on them, and, as the saying is, they flew under its wings.
   The result was, that they suffered more severely than others by the
   destruction of Tyre, and therefore the Prophet afterwards says, (verse
   4,) Be ashamed, O Sidon.

   Who replenished thee. He adds this general expression, either because
   it was filled with crowds and multitudes of men, when strangers flocked
   to it from various and distant countries, or because they who performed
   voyages to it for the sake of gain did, in their turn, enrich the city.

   3. And by great waters. He intimates that the riches of Tyre will not
   prevent it from being destroyed; and therefore he extols its wealth, in
   order that the judgment of God may be more manifest, and that all may
   know that it was no ordinary calamity that befel it; and the more
   unexpected it was, the more evidently would it appear to be the work of
   God.

   The seed of the Nile. [105] By an elegant expression he describes the
   wealth of Tyre; for since the Nile supplied it with wheat and other
   necessaries of life, and since a great quantity of corn was brought to
   it out of Egypt, he says that it had fields and sowing on the course of
   the Nile, just as the inhabitants of Venice say that their harvest is
   on the sea, because they have nothing that grows at home, but all that
   is necessary for food is brought to them by commerce. The Prophet
   speaks of the inhabitants of Tyre in the same manner; for it might be
   thought incredible that they whom the Nile so freely and abundantly
   supplied should be in want of food. He shews that this will be a vain
   boast, because they will be in want of all things; and these things, as
   we have already said, are described by Isaiah, that all may more fully
   acknowledge the avenging hand of God.

   4. Be thou ashamed, O Sidon; for the sea hath spoken. This verse is
   added for the purpose of heightening the picture. We have explained the
   reason why he speaks particularly of Sidon. He calls Tyre, by way of
   eminence, (kat ' exochen,) the sea, as if she reigned alone in the
   midst of the sea.

   I have not travailed. These words are immediately added, and belong
   (mimetikos) to a fictitious address put into the mouth of Tyre, in
   which the Prophet wittily taunts the inhabitants of Tyre, who boasted
   of her colonies; for she "brought forth" other illustrious cities. "In
   ancient times," says Pliny, "she was famous for the cities which she
   built, Leptis, Utica, and that rival of the Roman empire, Carthage,
   which aspired to govern the whole world, besides Cadiz, which was built
   beyond the limits of the world. Her whole superiority now consists of
   scarlet and purple." (Plin. Hist. Nat., lib. v. c. 19.) Thus, Isaiah
   represents Tyre as bewailing her ancient glory, because she has ceased
   to be a mother, and because it is of no avail to her that she has
   brought forth so many children, and founded so many cities; for at an
   early period Carthage sent regularly every year a present to Tyre, for
   the purpose of doing homage to her as the mother. In this manner Tyre
   appeared to hold a higher rank than all other cities, since even
   Carthage, though a rival of the Roman empire, was in some respect
   subject to Tyre: but the Lord stripped her of all her ornaments in a
   moment, so that she bewailed her bereavement, as if she had never
   brought up any children.

   5. As soon as the report shall reach the Egyptians. [106] In this verse
   he declares that this destruction will affect equally the inhabitants
   of Tyre and those of Egypt; and this confirms the exposition which we
   follow, that the present prophecy relates to a former devastation. The
   inhabitants of Tyre had been in alliance with the Egyptians, and both
   countries had been under kingly government; not as in Alexander's time,
   when Tyre was a free state, and lived under its own laws. The alliance
   which existed between the inhabitants of Tyre and those of Egypt could
   not have been more appropriately described; and therefore he shews that
   this ruin extends also to the Egyptians, because they prompted the Jews
   to rebellion, and turned them aside from confidence in God. The former
   were open enemies; the latter, under the pretense of friendship,
   cherished dangerous hostility; and therefore both are justly punished.

   6. Pass ye over to Tarshish. He addresses not only the inhabitants of
   Tyre, but foreigners who were connected with them by trading, and bids
   them go elsewhere and seek new harbours: and he mentions Cilicia, which
   was opposite to Tyre, as if he had said, "That shore, which was wont to
   be well supplied with harbours, will henceforth be forsaken, so that
   ships will sail in a very different direction;" for when a harbour or a
   mercantile city has been ruined, merchants commonly go in search of
   another.

   Howl, ye inhabitants of the island. [107] "Island," as we have formerly
   explained, is here put for "islands;" for the change of number is very
   customary with Hebrew writers. He foretells that they will lament,
   because their support depended entirely on that traffic, and because
   their accounts and reckonings [108] were scattered about in all
   directions.

   7. Is this your exulting city? The Prophet mocks at Tyre, and ridicules
   her pride, because she boasted of the antiquity of her name. He
   likewise confirms what all would suppose to be incredible; for this
   prediction was undoubtedly laughed at, seeing that the power of Tyre
   was unshaken, and her wealth was like a wall of brass. So much the more
   confidently does Isaiah speak, and threaten that her ruin is certain,
   and that, though she be more ancient than other cities, and though she
   be universally applauded on that ground, still this will not prevent
   her from being destroyed. The origin of Tyre is traced in profane
   history from time almost out of mind, and is so obscure and intricate,
   that hardly anything can be ascertained; though they allege that it was
   founded by the Phenicians, as those who boast of the fame of antiquity
   call themselves natives of the soil. With this antiquity the Prophet
   contrasts banishment, intimating that, when God had determined to
   inflict punishment on that nation, her stability would be at an end.

   Her feet shall carry her, to travel into a distant country. To follow
   wherever "the feet carry," is nothing else than to have long
   wanderings. Yet he also means that they will be deprived of their
   wealth, and will be in want of all things during their banishment, so
   that they will not have a conveyance of any kind, or a beast to carry
   them. Banishment is a very hard condition, when poverty is added to it;
   for it may be more easily endured where there are the means of
   supporting life; but when men must dwell in unknown countries in the
   deepest poverty, the misery is extreme. He adds the finishing stroke to
   their miseries by saying, that they must "travel into a distant
   country;" for the greater the distance, the harder is the banishment.

   8. Against crowning Tyre. He adorns with this title the city which
   enriched many, as may be easily learned from the context; for when he
   calls her merchants "kings," he plainly states that by the word crown
   he intended to express metaphorically the magnificence of kings. This
   refutes the opinion of those who refer it to other cities. The general
   meaning is, that she enriches her citizens as if she made them kings
   and princes.

   Some think that the Prophet added this verse, as if he were assuming
   the character of one who is astonished at the destruction of Tyre, in
   order to strike others with amazement; as if he had said, "Is it
   possible that Tyre should be so speedily overthrown, where riches, and
   troops, and defences, and fortifications, are so abundant, and where
   there is so much pomp and magnificence?" and as if he suddenly stopped,
   as we are wont to do, when anything unexpected has occurred. But it is
   better to connect it with the following verse, which removes every
   difficulty; for in that verse the Prophet himself immediately answers
   his own question, by which he intended to arouse the minds of his
   hearers to closer attention. He might have simply said, that these
   things were done by the purpose of the Lord; but we are sluggish, and
   stupid men would have treated them with contempt. By this question,
   therefore, he arouses their minds, that all may know that he is not
   speaking about an ordinary event, and that they may consider it more
   carefully; for the farther the judgments of God are removed from the
   ordinary opinions of men, so much the more ought they to excite our
   astonishment.

   He formerly spoke in the same manner about Egypt, when he intended to
   shew that the destruction of it could not be reckoned one of the
   ordinary changes. (Isaiah 19:1-25.) Since therefore it was incredible
   that Tyre could be overthrown by man, the Prophet justly infers that
   God is the author of its ruin. On this account he calls her the mother
   or nurse of kings, that he may place in a more striking light the glory
   of the divine judgment; for if it had been any ordinary state, its fall
   would have been viewed with contempt; but when it was adorned with the
   highest rank, who would think that this happened in any other way than
   by the purpose of God?

   Whose merchants are princes. [109] In like manner the merchants of
   Venice in the present day think that they are on a level with princes,
   and that they are above all other men except kings; and even the
   factors look on men of rank as beneath them. I have been told, too,
   that at Antwerp there are factors who do not hesitate to lay out
   expenses which the wealthiest of the nobility could not support. We are
   wont to put questions, when no reply can be given but what we wish; and
   this is an indication of boldness.

   9. To profane the pride, or, to profane the loftiness; for it may be
   read either way, because loftiness leads to pride, and where loftiness
   or a high spirit is found, there seldom is humility. But it will be
   better to read it Pride, which alone provokes the vengeance of God,
   when men, under pretense of their excellence, vaunt themselves above
   measure. To "profane" and to "despise" mean the same thing; for those
   who are high in rank imagine that they are separated from others, and
   consider themselves to have something indescribably lofty belonging to
   them, as if they ought not to mingle with the crowd of human beings.
   But God strips them of their rank, degrades them, and treats them as
   vile and worthless.

   From this passage let us learn, that we ought to contemplate the
   providence of God in such a manner as to ascribe to his almighty power
   the praise which it deserves for righteous government. Although the
   rectitude by which God regulates his judgments is not always apparent
   or made visible to us, still it is never lawful to separate his wisdom
   and justice from his power. But as the Scriptures very frequently state
   and clearly explain the reason why God does this or that, we ought
   carefully to examine the cause of his works.

   That invention which the Schoolmen have introduced, about the absolute
   power of God, is shocking blasphemy. It is all one as if they said that
   God is a tyrant who resolves to do what he pleases, not by justice, but
   through caprice. Their schools are full of such blasphemies, and are
   not unlike the heathens, who said that God sports with human affairs.
   But in the school of Christ we are taught that the justice of God
   shines brightly in his works, of whatever kind they are, "that every
   mouth may be stopped," (Romans 3:19,) and that glory may be ascribed to
   him alone.

   The Prophet therefore assigns the causes of so great an overthrow, that
   we may not think that God acts without a reason; for the inhabitants of
   Tyre were proud, ambitious, lewd, and licentious. These vices follow in
   the train of wealth and abundance, and commonly abound in mercantile
   cities. For this reason he shews that God is provoked on account of
   these vices, that all who are left may be taught by this example to pay
   greater attention to their own interests, and not to abuse the gifts of
   God for parade and luxury. Such is the benefit which we ought to draw
   from it, for we must not imagine that it is a bare history which is
   related to us.

   But a question arises, Does God hate the exalted rank of princes and
   lords? For he raises on high princes, senators, nobles, and all classes
   of magistrates and rulers; and how then can he hate them? I reply, the
   high station occupied by princes is not in itself hateful to God, but
   only on account of the vice which is accidental to it, that when they
   have been highly exalted, they despise others, and do not think that
   they are men. Thus, pride is almost always an attendant of high
   station, and therefore God hates it; and, in a word, he must rebuke
   that haughtiness of which he declares that he is an enemy.

   10. For there is not any longer a girdle. [110] mzch (mezach) is
   translated by some a girdle, and by others strength. Those who
   translate it girdle, suppose the meaning to be that Tyre will be so
   completely plundered, that she will not even have a girdle left; and
   that the allusion is to the vast wealth laid out in merchandise, for
   the poorest of the merchants sell girdles. But I think that Isaiah
   alludes to the situation of the city, which was protected on all sides
   by ditches, mounds, ramparts, and the sea.

   11. He stretched out his hand over the sea. It is thought that the
   prediction which the Prophet uttered, about the destruction of Tyre, is
   here confirmed by examples; namely, that the Lord has given so many
   examples of his power in overturning the greatest kingdoms, that we
   ought not to think it strange if he now overturn Tyre, however
   flourishing and wealthy it may be. And indeed this manner of speaking
   is frequently employed in Scripture, if it be not made plain by
   manifest examples and by actual demonstration. It is therefore believed
   that the Prophet here calls to remembrance the deliverance from Egypt,
   when the Lord divided the sea, (Exodus 14:21,22,) and again, when he
   drove out seven kings, and brought his people into the land of Canaan.
   (Joshua 6:1-27; 8:1-35; 10:1-43.) But when I take a closer view of the
   words of the Prophet, I am more disposed to explain them as referring
   to the present state of matters; for he speaks here of Tyre, whose
   riches covered the whole sea.

   He shook the kingdoms. What he says about the kingdoms is, because she
   could not perish alone, but must at the same time involve many kingdoms
   in her ruin. Thus the whole world must have undergone some change, as
   appears from history; and finally, the Prophet himself draws the
   conclusion, that the Lord commanded that this mart of nations should be
   overthrown.

   Jehovah hath given commandment concerning Canaan. [111] The word knn
   (chEnaan) has led commentators to think that the Prophet here speaks of
   the Canaanites, and refers to the proof which God gave of his vengeance
   against them. But there is little force in that argument; for knn
   (chEnaan) is often taken for a common noun, just as, a little before,
   (verse 8,) he used the word knnyh (chinyaneiha) to mean her factors.
   The riches of Tyre having consisted of merchandise and trading, Isaiah
   described it by naming the principal part. By the expression, hath
   given commandment, he extols the providence of God, that the Jews may
   know that all that appears to be permanent in the world stands and
   falls according to the will of God, and that there is no need of the
   instruments of war for overturning the best fortified place, but the
   mere expression of the will of God is enough.

   12. And he said, Thou shalt not add any more to rejoice. [112] All this
   belongs to one and the same object; for, since a plain description
   would not have had sufficient weight, the Prophet confirms his
   prediction by many words. It was incredible that a city so celebrated
   and powerful, so well defended and fortified, and associated with many
   allies and confederates, should be destroyed and overturned. When he
   says, Thou shalt not add, he does not intend to shut out the hope of
   restoration which he will give soon afterwards; for this threatening
   ought to be limited to the time of the ruin of Tyre, "Thou shalt not
   live wantonly, as formerly thou wert wont to do."

   O virgin. Metaphorically he calls her a virgin, because, previous to
   that time, the riches of Tyre were untouched, and had suffered no
   injury. This is not praise of chastity, but a witty manner of saying
   that the treasures which had been laid up in faithful custody will be
   violated. "Formerly thou didst skip lightly, like heifers in the bloom
   of youth; but when thou hast suffered violence, there will be an end of
   thy mirth;" just as if one should say, that the city of Venice has not
   lost her virginity because it has not been taken by force since it was
   built.

   Daughter of Sidon. He continues to speak of Tyre, but gives it this
   name, because it was built by the Sidonians, though the daughter
   excelled the mother, as frequently happens in human affairs. The
   convenience and situation of the place gave a superiority to the
   inhabitants of Tyre, and Sidon became but an appendage. From the book
   of Kings it is evident enough (1 Kings 5:1) that the monarchy of Tyre
   had a high reputation, but here the Prophet looked at its origin.

   Pass over to Chittim. When he bids them pass over to Chittim, he
   banishes them not only into Cilicia, but into countries still more
   distant; for under this name he includes Greece, Italy, and other
   countries; as if he had said, "When thou shalt change thy residence on
   account of banishment, thou shalt have no settled habitation in
   neighboring countries; but thou must wander through the whole world,
   shalt be dragged into unknown countries, and even there thou shalt find
   no rest." Lastly, he means that the ruin will be so lamentable, that
   they will not have among neighbors, and, after crossing the sea, they
   will not have among foreigners, a place of rest.

   13. Behold, the land of the Chaldeans. He now confirms by an example
   what he predicted about the taking of Tyre; for those things could
   scarcely obtain credit, especially among the inhabitants of Tyre, who
   thought that they were very far from such ruin. I am aware that this
   passage is explained in various ways, but I shall not spend time in
   refuting the opinions of others. It will be enough if I shall state, as
   far as I am able to form a judgment of it, the Prophet's real meaning.

   The people of the Chaldeans was not; that is, they had no name; for, if
   we inquire into their origin, they were descended from the Assyrians,
   as is evident from Genesis 10:11. He therefore says truly, that they
   were not at first a nation, but were concealed under the name of
   another, so that they did not form a separate body.

   Ashur founded it for the inhabitants of the wilderness. The words which
   we have rendered "inhabitants of the wilderness" others translate
   ships, but we do not approve of that exposition. What we at first
   stated is preferable, namely, that the Assyrians gave a settled
   condition to the Chaldeans, who formerly led a wandering life in the
   deserts under skins, [113] but were collected into cities, and trained
   to higher civilization, by the Assyrians. This is also the meaning of
   the word vrrv (gnOrEru,) namely, that they erected and built cities;
   for we cannot agree with those who render it "to destroy." [114] What
   happened?

   He brought it to ruin. That is, to use a common expression, "The
   daughter has devoured the mother;" for the Assyrian monarchy was
   overturned by the Chaldeans, though it was more powerful and
   flourishing than all the others. It will be said, what has this to do
   with Tyre? We answer, it is because Tyre will be overthrown by the
   Assyrians and Chaldeans. Since therefore the Chaldeans, who formerly
   were no people, could conquer the Assyrians and subject them to their
   power, why should we wonder if both united should conquer Tyre? Since
   the Lord gave such a display of his power in the case of the Assyrians,
   why should Tyre rely on her riches? She will undoubtedly be made to
   feel the hand of God, and her power will be of no avail to her.

   14. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish. He repeats what he formerly said; for
   the Cilicians, on account of their vicinity, constantly traded with the
   inhabitants of Tyre. He bids their ships howl, because, when that
   harbour is shut up, the merchants will be struck with amazement at not
   having their ordinary intercourse. He calls that harbour which they
   visited, their strength, not only because it was a place of resort that
   might be relied on, but because there was no other way in which their
   voyages could yield profit.

   15. And it shall come to pass in that day. After having spoken of the
   taking of Tyre, he next declares how long her calamity shall endure. It
   happens that cities which have been ruined are suddenly restored, and
   regain their former position; but the Prophet testifies that this city
   will be desolate and ruinous for seventy years. By being forgotten he
   means that there will be no merchandise, because she will not have the
   ordinary course of trade.

   According to the days of one king. [115] Some think that the days of
   one king relate to David, but that is exceedingly frivolous, for "the
   days of a king" are put for the age of a man, in the same manner as the
   age of a man is shewn by the Psalmist to be generally limited to
   seventy years. (Psalm 90:10.) But why did he mention "a king" rather
   than any other man? It was because Tyre had a king, and reckoned time
   by the life of a king. This contributed greatly to establish the
   certainty of the prediction, for the Prophet could not have ascertained
   it by human conjectures.

   Tyre shall have a song like that of a harlot. By "the song of a harlot"
   he employs a beautiful comparison to denote merchandise; not that in
   itself it ought to be condemned, for it is useful and necessary to a
   commonwealth, but he alludes to the fraud and dishonesty with which it
   frequently abounds, so that it may justly be compared to the occupation
   of a harlot.

   16. Take a harp. He compares Tyre to a harlot, who, after having spent
   the whole period of her youth in debauchery, has at length grown old,
   and on that account is forsaken and despised by all, and yet cannot
   forget her former gain and lewdness, but desires to grow young again
   and renew her loves, and, in order to attract men, goes about the city,
   delighting their ears by songs and musical instruments. Such
   prostitutes are seized with some kind of madness, when they perceive
   that they are disregarded on account of their old age; and we see that
   Horace mocks at Lydia on this account. [116] Thus Tyre, after having
   been ruined, and as it were buried in oblivion, will again put forth
   her efforts, and schemes, and contrivances, for recovering her former
   condition.

   Make sweet melody. By the "harp" and "sweet melody," he means the
   tricks, and frauds, and blandishments, and flatteries of merchants, by
   which they impose on men, and as it were drive them into their nets. In
   a word, he shews by what methods mercantile cities become rich, that
   is, by deceitful and unlawful methods; and therefore he says, that Tyre
   will regale their ears by pleasant melody.

   Sing many songs. That is, Tyre will add fraud to fraud, and allurements
   to allurements, that at length she may attract all to her, may be again
   remembered by men, and recover her former celebrity. In short, as an
   old harlot contrives methods for regaining the favor of men, and
   allures them by painting, and ornaments, and dress, and songs, and
   musical instruments, so will Tyre recover her wealth and power by the
   same arts with which she formerly succeeded. And yet he does not on
   that account exhort Tyre to restore herself in this way, but proceeds
   with his prophecy.

   17. Jehovah will visit Tyre. [117] Although the Lord will afflict Tyre
   in such a manner that she will appear to be ruined, yet he declares
   that she will obtain mercy, because, rising at length out of her ruins,
   she will be restored to her former vigor. Such a restoration is justly
   ascribed to the favor of God; for otherwise the same thing must have
   happened to them as Malachi foretells would happen to the Edomites,
   that the Lord would overturn and destroy all that men would build.
   (Malachi 1:4.) Consequently they would never have returned to their
   former condition if the Lord had not aided them.

   From these words we ought to draw a profitable doctrine, that though
   the Lord is a severe judge towards the wicked, yet he leaves room for
   the exercise of his compassion, and is never so harsh as not to
   mitigate his chastisements, and at length to put an end to them. And if
   he is such towards the wicked, what will he be towards those whom he
   has adopted, and on whom he determines to pour out his goodness? When
   kingdoms therefore are re-established, when cities are rebuilt, and
   nations regain their freedom, this is brought about solely by the
   providence of God, who, whenever he pleases, lays low what is high, (1
   Samuel 2:7, Luke 1:52,) and quickly raises up and restores what was
   fallen.

   And then she will return to her hire. This ought to be viewed as a
   contrast to the former statement, for the meaning is, that Tyre will be
   no better, and will not be reformed by so severe a chastisement,
   because she will quickly return to her natural disposition; for he
   accuses her of ingratitude. We see instances of the same kind every
   day. There is scarcely a corner of the world in which the Lord has not
   exhibited proofs of his judgment. To those whom he has chastised he
   allows time to breathe, but they become no better. Isaiah says that
   this will happen to Tyre.

   She will commit fornication. "She will not repent, but, on the
   contrary, will return to her former courses. She will commit
   fornication, as she was formerly accustomed to do." He unquestionably
   speaks of buying and selling, but continues to employ the comparison
   which he had adopted; not that he wishes to condemn the occupation of a
   merchant, as we have already said, but that it is so largely mingled
   with the corruption of men as to resemble closely the life of a harlot;
   for it is so full of tricks, and hidden stratagems, and deep-laid
   traps, (as we often see,) that it appears to have been contrived for
   the purpose of ensnaring and deceiving men. How many new and unheard of
   contrivances for making gain and exacting usury are every day invented,
   which no one who has not been long trained in the school of merchandise
   can understand? We need not wonder, therefore, that the Prophet made
   use of this comparison, for it means that Tyre will have no more
   honesty than before in mercantile transactions.

   18. But her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the Lord.
   This was another instance of the divine compassion towards Tyre. Though
   she had been restored, yet she was not converted to God, but continued
   to follow dishonest practices, so that she justly deserved to be
   ruined. And indeed she was again punished severely, when Alexander took
   the city by storm; but still the kingdom of Christ, as Luke informs us,
   was erected there. (Acts 21:4.) This verse ought therefore to be viewed
   as contrasted with the former, as if he had said, "And yet the
   merchandise of Tyre shall be consecrated to God." Here we have an
   astonishing proof of the goodness of God, which penetrated not only
   into this abominable brothel, but almost into hell itself. The
   restoration of Tyre ought thus to be regarded as a proof of the
   goodness of God; but the former favor was small in comparison with the
   second, when God consecrated her to himself.

   But a question arises, "Could that which the inhabitants of Tyre
   obtained by cheating and unlawful methods be offered to God in
   sacrifice?" For God abhors such sacrifices, and demands an honest and
   pure conscience. (Proverbs 21:27, Isaiah 1:13.) Many commentators, in
   expounding this passage, give themselves much uneasiness about this
   question, but without any good reason; for the Prophet does not mean
   that the merchandise of Tyre will be consecrated to God while she
   continues to commit fornication, but describes a time subsequent to her
   change and conversion. At that time she will not lay up riches for
   herself, will not amass them by unlawful methods, but will employ them
   in the service of God, and will spend the produce of her merchandise in
   relieving the wants of the godly. When he used a word expressive of
   what was disgraceful, he had his eye on the past, but intimated that
   she would unlearn those wicked practices, and change her disposition.

   It shall not be treasured nor laid up. He describes, in a few words,
   the repentance of Tyre, who, having formerly been addicted to avarice,
   has been converted to Christ, and will no longer labor to amass riches,
   but will employ them in kind and generous actions; and this is the true
   fruit of repentance, as Paul admonishes, that "he who stole should
   steal no more, but, on the contrary, should labor that he might relieve
   the poor and needy." (Ephesians 4:28.) Isaiah foretells that the
   inhabitants of Tyre, who formerly, through insatiable avarice, devoured
   the riches of all, will henceforth take pleasure in generous actions,
   because they will no longer have an insatiable desire of gain. It is an
   evidence of brotherly love when we relieve our neighbors, as it is an
   evidence of cruelty if we suffer them to be hungry, especially when we
   ourselves have abundance.

   Her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the Lord. He next
   mentions a proper method of exercising generosity, which is, to employ
   their wealth in aiding the servants of God. Though he includes all
   godly persons, yet he alludes to the Levites and priests, some of whom
   sacrificed, while others made ready the sacrifices, and others kept
   watch, and, in short, all were ready to perform their duty; and
   therefore they were said to "dwell before the Lord." (Numbers 3 and 4.)
   The same thing may justly be said of all the ministers of the Church.
   But as all believers, of whatever rank they are, belong to the
   sanctuary of God, and have been made by Christ "a royal priesthood," (1
   Peter 2:9; Revelation 1:6,) that they may stand in the presence of God,
   so I willingly regard this passage as relating to all "the household of
   faith," (Galatians 6:10,) to whom attention is especially due; for Paul
   holds them out as having the highest claims, and enjoins that they
   shall be first relieved. If the tie which binds us universally to
   mankind ought to prevent us from "despising our own flesh," (Isaiah
   58:7,) how much more the tie that binds the members of Christ, which is
   closer and more sacred than any natural bonds?

   We ought also to attend to this mode of expression, by which we are
   said to "dwell before God;" [118] for though there is not now any "Ark
   of the Covenant," (Hebrews 9:4,) yet, through the kindness of Christ,
   we approach more nearly to God than the Levites formerly did. We are
   therefore enjoined to "walk before him," as if we were under his eye,
   that we may follow holiness and justice with a pure conscience. We are
   enjoined to walk before him, and always to consider him as present,
   that we may be just and upright.

   That they may eat till they are satisfied. [119] The Prophet means that
   we ought to supply the wants of brethren with greater abundance and
   generosity than what is customary among men; for when neighbors ought
   to be relieved, men are very niggardly. Few men perform cheerfully any
   gratuitous duty, or labor, or kindness; for they reckon that they give
   up and take from their own property all that they bestow on others. For
   the purpose of correcting this error, God highly commends cheerfulness;
   for the command which Paul gives to deacons, "to distribute joyfully,"
   (Romans 12:8,) ought to be applied to all; and all ought to remember
   that passage which declares that "God loveth a cheerful giver." (2
   Corinthians 9:7.)

   It deserves our attention, also, that the Prophet says that what is
   bestowed on the poor is consecrated to God; as the Spirit elsewhere
   teaches, that "with such sacrifices God is well pleased." (Hebrews
   13:16; 2 Corinthians 9:12.) Never was it on his own account that he
   commanded sacrifices to be made, nor did he ever stand in need of them.
   But under the law he ordained such exercises of piety; and he now
   commands us to bestow and spend on our neighbors something that is our
   own, and declares that all that we lay out on their account [120] is "a
   sacrifice of sweet savor," (Philippians 4:18,) and is approved and
   accepted by him. This ought powerfully to inflame us to the exercise of
   kindness and generosity, when we learn that our alms are so highly
   applauded, and that our hands, as well as our gift, are consecrated to
   God.

   mile = 1760 yards = 5280 feet. Therefore a Roman mile is to an English
   mile as 5000 to 5280, or as 125 to 132; and the number of English miles
   is to that of Roman miles in the inverse ratio of 132 to 125; so that
   200 stadia = 25 Roman miles = somewhat less than 24 English miles. It
   ought to be remembered, that the author does not profess to state the

   Phoenicians of Sidon and Tyre," says an able historian, "was extensive
   and adventurous; and both in their manners and policy, they resemble
   the great commercial states of modern times, more than any people in
   the ancient world." After mentioning the navigation to Tyre as the
   earliest route of communication with India, he goes on to say, "To this
   circumstance, which, for a considerable time, secured to them a
   monopoly of that trade, was owing, not only the extraordinary wealth of
   individuals, which rendered the merchants of Tyre, princes and her
   traffickers the honorable of the earth,' (Isaiah 23:8,) but the
   extensive power of the state itself, which first taught men to conceive
   what vast resources a commercial people possess, and what great
   exertions they are capable of making." He adds in a note, "The power
   and opulence of Tyre, in the prosperous age of its commerce, must have
   attracted general attention. In the prophecies of Ezekiel, who
   flourished two hundred and sixty years before the fall of Tyre, there
   is the most particular account of the nature and variety of its
   commercial transactions that is to be found in any ancient writer; and
   which conveys, at the same time, a magnificent idea of the extensive
   power of that state." -- Robertson's Historical Disquisition concerning
   the Knowledge which the Ancients had of India ^FT367 "There is no more

   CHAPTER 24
     __________________________________________________________________

   Isaiah Chapter 24:1-23

   1. Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and
   turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.

   1. Ecce Iehova evacuat terram, denudat eam, evertit faciem ejus, et
   incolas ejus dissipat.

   2. And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the
   servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as
   with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the
   borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to
   him.

   2. Et erit ut populus, ita sacerdos; ut servus, ita domina ejus; ut
   ancilla, ita domina ejus; ut emptor, ita venditor; ut mutuo dans, ita
   qui mutuo accipit; ut foenerator, ita qui accipit foenori, (vel, ut
   creditor, ita debitor.)

   3. The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the Lord
   hath spoken this word.

   3. Evacuando evacuabitur terra, et direptione diripietur; quoniam
   Iehova pronunciavit hoc verbum.

   4. The earth mourneth and fadeth away; the world languisheth and fadeth
   away; the haughty people of the earth do languish.

   4. Luxit, cecidit terra; elanguit, cecidit orbis; elanguerunt qui erant
   sublimis populus terræ.

   5. The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because
   they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the
   everlasting covenant.

   5. Et terra fallax fuit sub incolis suis; quoniam transgressi sunt
   leges, mutarunt statutum, dissolverunt foedus seculi.

   6. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell
   therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are
   burned, and few men left.

   6. Itaque maledictio cosumpsit terram, et desolati sunt incolæ ejus;
   ideo combusti sunt, inquam, incolæ terræ; et pauci residui sunt facti
   homines.

   7. The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merry hearted
   do sigh.

   7. Periit vinum, elanguit vitis, gemuerunt omnes qui læto erant corde.

   8. The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth,
   the joy of the harp ceaseth.

   8. Cessavit gaudium tympanorum, desiit strepitus exultantium, quievit
   lætitia citharæ.

   9. They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter
   to them that drink it.

   9. Cum cantico non bibent vinum; amara erit sicera bibentibus eam.

   10. The city of confusion is broken down; every house is shut up, that
   no man may come in.

   10. Contrita est civitas vanitatis; clausa est omnis domus, ne quis
   ingrediatur.

   11 There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the
   mirth of the land is gone.

   11. Clamor est super vino in plateis; obscuratum est omne gaudium;
   migravit lætitia terræ.

   12. In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with
   destruction.

   12. Residua est in urbe vastitas, et vastatione percussa est porta.

   13. When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people,
   there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as the
   gleaning-grapes when the vintage is done.

   13. Quia sic erit in medio terræ, in medio populorum, quasi decussio
   olivæ, et quasi racemi, cum peracta est vindemia.

   14. They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of
   the Lord, they shall cry aloud from the sea.

   14. Hi levabunt vocem suam; jubilabunt in altitudine Iehovæ,
   vociferabuntur a mari.

   15. Wherefore glorify ye the Lord in the fires, even the name of the
   Lord God of Israel in the isles of the sea.

   15. Propterea in vallibus glorificate Iehovam, in insulis maris nomen
   Iehovæ Dei Israel.

   16. From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even
   glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto
   me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the
   treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.

   16. Ab extremo terræ laudes audivimus, gloriam (vel, gratulationem)
   justo, et dixi, Macies mihi, macies mihi, væ mihi. Prævaricatores
   prævaricati sunt; prævaricatione, inquam, prævaricatores prævaricati
   sunt.

   17. Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of
   the earth.

   17. Pavor, et fovea, et laqueus super te, O icola terræ.

   18. And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the
   fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of
   the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are
   open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.

   18. Et accidet ut qui effugerit a voce pavoris, incidat in foveam; et
   qui ascenderit e medio foveæ capiatur laqueo. Quoniam fenestræ de
   excelso apertæ sunt; et commota sunt fundamenta terræ.

   19. The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the
   earth is moved exceedingly.

   19. Contritione contrita est terra; dissolutione dissoluta est terra;
   commotione commota est terra.

   20. The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be
   removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy
   upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.

   20. Agitatione agitata est terra, sicut ebrius; et transferetur sicut
   tabernaculum; et gravis erit super eam iniquitas ejus; et corruet,
   neque adjiciet ut resurgat.

   21. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall punish
   the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth
   upon the earth.

   21. Et erit in die illa, visitabit Iehova super exercitum excelsum in
   excelso, et super reges terræ super terram.

   22. And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in
   the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall
   they be visited.

   22. Et congregabuntur congregatione instar vinctorum in carcere, et
   claudentur in ergastulo; deinde post multos dies visitabuntur.

   23. Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the
   Lord of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before
   his ancients gloriously.

   23. Erubescet luna, et pudefiet sol; cum regnaverit Iehova exercituum
   in monte Sion, et in Ierusalem; et coram senibus suis gloria.


   1. Behold, Jehovah maketh the earth empty. This prophecy, so far as I
   can judge, is the conclusion of all the descriptions that have been
   given from the thirteenth chapter downwards, in which Isaiah foretold
   destruction not only to the Jews and to Israel, but to the Moabites,
   Assyrians, Egyptians, and other nations. In short, having, as it were,
   surveyed all the countries which were near the Jews and known to them,
   he gives a brief summary of the whole. Some view this as referring to
   Israel, and others to the Jews, and think that their destruction is
   foretold; but as he mentions the world, I can view it in no other light
   than as a comprehensive statement of all that he formerly said about
   each of them, and at different times. Nor is this view contradicted by
   the fact that he immediately mentions the priest, which might lead us
   to believe that these things relate to none but the people of God; for
   although he speaks of all the nations, yet because the Jews always hold
   the highest rank, Isaiah must have had them especially in his eye, for
   he was appointed to them. It may be said to have been accidental that
   he mentions other nations; and therefore we ought not to wonder if,
   after having made reference to them, he speaks particularly about his
   own people in a single word.

   Others suppose that he means "the whole world," but think that he
   refers to the last day, which I consider to be an excessively forced
   interpretation; for, after having threatened the Jews and other
   nations, the Prophet afterwards adds a consolation, that the Lord will
   one day raise up his Church and make her more flourishing; which
   certainly cannot apply to the last judgment. But by the term the earth,
   I do not think that the Prophet means the whole world, but the
   countries well known to the Jews; just as in the present day, when we
   speak of what happens in the world, we almost never go beyond Europe,
   or think of what is passing in India; for this may be said to be our
   world. Thus, Isaiah speaks of "the earth" known to himself and to all
   whom he addressed, and of the people who inhabited the neighboring
   countries. In short, we may limit the term "World" to the Egyptians,
   Assyrians, Moabites, Tyrians, and such like; as if he had said,
   "Hitherto I have spoken of various calamities, which threatened many
   nations, and still in part threaten some of them; but I may sum up all
   by saying, The Lord will overturn and strip the face of the earth of
   all its ornaments.'"

   And maketh it bare. [121] Some translate vlqh, (bOlEkach,) he
   uncovereth the earth, that the enemies may have free entrance into it.
   But I choose rather to translate it, "he maketh bare the earth,"
   because the earth is said to be "covered," when it is inhabited by a
   great multitude of men, and when it abounds in fruits and flocks; and
   it is said to be "uncovered" or "laid bare," when it is deprived of its
   inhabitants, and when its covering is taken away from it, as if one
   were stripped of his raiment and ornaments. Now, this must have
   happened not only to the Jews, but to the Assyrians, Egyptians, and
   other nations, which he had mentioned; and therefore to all of them
   together he threatens their ruin.

   2. And it shall be. By these words he means the utmost desolation, in
   which there will be no longer any distinction of ranks or any
   appearance of a commonwealth; for so long as there is a tolerably
   regular form of government, some distinction continues to be maintained
   between "the people" and "the priests." By a figure of speech, in which
   a part is taken for the whole, (sunekdochikos,) he mentions one
   department instead of the whole class, as is frequently done in the
   Scriptures; though we might take kchnym, (kOchanim,) to mean those who
   hold any high rank; for Hebrew writers frequently give this name to
   princes, and especially to those who are of royal blood; but I have no
   reluctance to view it as an instance of the figure of speech which I
   have mentioned.

   Since Isaiah reckons this confusion among the curses of God, and
   declares that, when the distinction of ranks is laid aside, it is a
   terrible display of the vengeance of God, we ought to conclude, on the
   other hand, how much God is pleased with regular government and the
   good order of society, and also how great a privilege it is to have it
   preserved among us; for when it is taken away, the life of man differs
   little from the sustenance of cattle and of beasts of prey. We ought
   therefore not only to acknowledge the dreadful vengeance of God, but
   also to lay it to the blame of our own sins, whenever he breaks down
   order and takes away instruction and courts of law; for when these
   fall, civilisation itself falls along with them. It ought also to be
   considered that, when the Lord executes his judgments, he spares no
   rank, not even the most sacred. What was this order of priests, which
   the Lord had so splendidly adorned, and had determined to consecrate to
   himself, and of which the people also boasted as if it had been
   unchangeable and eternal? Yet even the rank of priesthood is involved
   in the judgment of God, because there is no respect of persons, but, on
   the contrary, the more highly any have been favored, and the higher the
   rank to which they have been exalted, the more severely will he punish
   them, if they shall shew themselves to be ungrateful and abuse his
   benefits.

   As the servant, so his master; as the buyer, so the seller. This
   statement is to the same effect with what goes before; for these ranks
   are manifestly lawful, and are not usually set aside, unless when the
   Lord determines to chastise his people with dreadful vengeance, as we
   have already said; for in a well-ordered society the distinction
   between master and servant must be observed. In like manner, no public
   government can be lasting without the transactions of commerce; and
   therefore, when the distinction between rich and poor has been taken
   away, every scheme for gaining a livelihood among men is destroyed. The
   meaning of the Prophet is, that all civil government will be broken up,
   because in such calamities, they who were the wealthiest are reduced to
   the lowest poverty. In short, he describes the most appalling
   desolation, which will be followed by unwonted change.

   3. By emptying shall the earth be emptied. He confirms what he had
   already said, and declares that those changes will not be accidental,
   but that they are the work of God. In the first verse, he had expressly
   stated that God is making preparations for emptying the earth: he now
   asserts that it will happen, and adds the reason, that God hath
   purposed and determined to do it.

   4. The earth hath lamented. Isaiah proceeds with his subject; for all
   this tends to explain the desolation of the whole world, that is, of
   the world which was known to the Jews. According to his custom, he
   illustrates the judgment of God more clearly by figures, which are
   fitted to produce an effect on sluggish minds.

   The lofty people of the earth. [122] By the "lofty ones" we must
   understand those eminent persons who held a higher rank than others;
   for this is more wonderful than if the common people had fallen. Yet if
   it be thought preferable to explain it as relating peculiarly to the
   Jews, I have no objection; for although the Assyrians and Egyptians
   excelled them in wealth and power, still the Jews held the highest rank
   in this respect, that they had been adopted by God. But I prefer the
   other exposition, which makes the meaning to be, that the Lord would
   inflict punishment, not only on common people, but also on those who
   surpassed others in rank and splendor.

   5. And the earth was deceitful. [123] Others render it "defiled" or
   "polluted," because knph (chanaph) means "to be wicked." Both
   renderings may be appropriate; but the next verse appears to demand
   that we explain it to mean false; for he appears to illustrate and
   exhibit it more fully immediately afterwards, when he says that "the
   earth has been consumed by a curse."

   Under its inhabitants. Whether tht (tahath) be translated "Under its
   inhabitants," or, "On account of its inhabitants," is of little
   importance. There is a kind of mutual bargain between the land and the
   husbandmen, that it gives back with usury what it has received: if it
   does not, it deceives those who cultivate it. But he assigns a reason,
   imputing blame to them, that they render it barren by their wickedness.
   It is owing to our fault that it does not nourish us or bring forth
   fruit, as God appointed to be done by the regular order of nature; for
   he wished that it should hold the place of a mother to us, to supply us
   with food; and if it change its nature and order, or lose its
   fertility, we ought to attribute it to our sins, since we ourselves
   have reversed the order which God had appointed; otherwise the earth
   would never deceive us, but would perform her duty.

   Because they have transgressed the laws. He immediately assigns the
   reason why the earth is unfaithful, and deceives her inhabitants. It is
   because those who refuse to honor God their Father and supporter, will
   justly be deprived of food and nourishment. Here he peculiarly holds up
   to shame the revolt of his nation, because it was baser and less
   excusable than all the transgressions of those who had never been
   taught in the school of God. The word tvrh (tOrah) is applied to "the
   Law," because it denotes instruction; but here, in the plural number,
   tvrt (tOrOth,) it denotes all the instruction that is contained in the
   "Law." But as the "Law" contains both commandments and promises, he
   adds two parts for the purpose of explanation.

   They have changed the ordinance. The Hebrew word chq (chOk) means "an
   ordinance," and on that account some think that it denotes ceremonies,
   and others that it denotes morals. We may render it "commandments;" and
   I understand it to mean not only ceremonies, but everything that
   belongs to the rule of a holy life.

   They have broken the everlasting covenant. The third term employed by
   him is, vryt, (berith,) by which he means a covenant and contract. This
   word is limited to those "contracts" by which the Lord, who adopted his
   people, promised that he would be their God. (Exodus 19:6; 29:45;
   Leviticus 26:12.) He therefore charges them with ingratitude, because,
   when the Lord revealed himself by all these methods, and gave proofs of
   his love, they were disobedient and rebellious, "transgressed the
   laws," and "broke the holy covenant."

   But why does he address himself to the Jews? Because he knew that he
   had been appointed to be their Prophet, that he might especially give
   instructions to them. Hence we may infer what is the rule of a holy
   life. It is contained in that law which we ought to follow if we wish
   that God should approve of our life; if we turn aside from it, we must
   be wicked and abandoned. We ought also to remark, that it is the will
   of God that in his word we should consider not only his commandments
   and laws, but also his covenant; for the chief part of the word
   consists of promises, by which he adopts and receives us as his own
   people. Besides, the Prophet unquestionably intended to use a variety
   of terms in order to express his meaning more strongly; as if he had
   said, "There is nothing about us that is sound and pure; everything is
   polluted and corrupted."

   He calls it "the covenant of eternity," or "the everlasting covenant,"
   because it ought to be perpetual and inviolable, and to be in force in
   every age. It was to be transmitted, in uninterrupted succession, from
   father to son, that it might never be effaced from the memory of man,
   but might be kept pure and entire. He therefore represents in strong
   terms their treachery and wickedness, because they dared to violate
   that covenant which God had made with them, and to overthrow what the
   Lord intended to be firm and permanent. This was monstrous; and
   therefore we ought not to wonder that the earth takes vengeance for
   this wickedness, and refuses to give food to men.

   6. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth. Some render it perjury,
   [124] but as 'lh (alah) signifies also a "curse," I have no doubt that
   here he employs it to denote a "curse," and alludes to those curses
   which Moses in the law threatens against wicked men and transgressors
   of the law, (Leviticus 26:16; Deuteronomy 28:15.) We know that the
   earth was cursed on account of the transgression of our first parent,
   so that it brought forth thorns and thistles instead of fruits.
   (Genesis 3:17, 18.) The Lord mitigated this curse, so that, although
   men were ungrateful and unworthy, still it yielded them food. But when
   we do not cease to sin, and when we add sin to sin, is it not in the
   highest degree just that the earth should become barren and unfruitful,
   in order that we may more clearly perceive this curse, and that it may
   make a deeper impression on our senses?

   And its inhabitants are made desolate. I think that 'sm (asham) here
   means "to make desolate," rather than "to forsake;" and this is
   apparent from the context, on which account I have translated it "are
   made desolate." But perhaps it will be thought preferable to take the
   copulative v (vau) as signifying because, and then the meaning will be,
   "The earth accursed by God is burnt up, because its inhabitants have
   acted wickedly." [125]

   Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.
   The word chrv (charu) may be taken metaphorically, and I prefer this
   view of it, which makes the meaning to be, that those whom the wrath of
   God has consumed are burned up; because the destruction is compared to
   a conflagration. When he adds, "that few will be left," we learn from
   it that this prediction cannot be explained as relating to the last day
   of judgment, and that, on the contrary, the Prophet foretells and
   confirms those desolations which threatened various nations, and that
   he does so in order that the godly may fear, and may be led to
   repentance, and may be prepared for enduring all things.

   7. The wine hath failed. The same subject is continued, and the Prophet
   threatens chiefly against the Jews the desolation of the land. He gives
   a long description in order to affect them more deeply, and impress
   them with a conviction of the judgment of God. Their luxury,
   intemperance, and feasting, are rapidly surveyed, because amidst so
   great abundance they proudly disobeyed God. Such ingratitude was not
   peculiar to the Jews or to that age, but it is universally found that
   they who enjoy abundance rebel against God, and indulge themselves too
   freely. On this account the Prophet censures them; as if he had said,
   "Hitherto you have been plunged in luxuries and pleasures, but the Lord
   will cause you to lead a very different kind of life." Isaiah speaks of
   the future as if it had been present, in order to place it more clearly
   before their eyes.

   9. They shall not drink wine with a song. To drink wine is not in
   itself evil, because God has appointed it for the use of man; but here
   the Prophet describes the banquets of drunkards, which were full of
   licentiousness, songs, and insolence. Again, because they abused their
   enjoyment of plenty, he threatens them with want, which men almost
   bring upon themselves, when by their luxury they turn to a bad use the
   goodness of God.

   Strong drink shall be bitter. He adds, that if they drink wine, it will
   be "bitter" to them; because sorrow commonly deprives men of a relish
   both for what they eat and for what they drink. The meaning may be thus
   summed up, "Though they have abundance of wine, yet they will be
   deprived of the use of it, because they will feel such sorrow as shall
   take away all relish for it." "Strong drink shall be bitter;" that is,
   you shall no longer enjoy those pleasures and delights in which you
   have hitherto indulged.

   10. The city of [126] vanity is broken down. I do not object to viewing
   this as relating especially to the desolation of Jerusalem. Yet it may
   be gathered from the context that it applies also to other cities; for
   shortly afterwards he uses the plural number in summoning the nations
   to appear before the same tribunal. But as the Prophet had his own
   countrymen chiefly in view, we may properly consider it to denote
   Jerusalem, which he calls "the city of vanity," either because there
   was no solid virtue in it, or because it was destroyed.

   The word thv (tOhu) may refer either to the destruction itself, or to
   their crimes, by which they provoked the wrath of God against them. If
   it be thought better to refer it to their crimes, it will denote "the
   city of confusion," in which nothing is regular or properly arranged;
   and I approve of this interpretation. Yet it may refer to the
   punishment; for it declares, in my opinion, the cause of the
   destruction, and gives up the city to ruin, because justice and good
   government are banished from it.

   Every house is shut up. This is a proof of solitude, and the only
   reason why it is added is, to express the desolation of that city.

   11. There is a cry about wine. He means, that there will be a scarcity
   of wine; for where want or hunger is found, it is accompanied by
   unceasing complaints, not only in private, but "in the streets" and
   public places. He therefore points out those doleful sounds and
   complaints, but, at the same time, reproves their luxury and
   intemperance, because they were not satisfied with what was necessary,
   but greedily swallowed wine, and abandoned themselves to every kind of
   enjoyment. We must supply the contrast. "Hitherto you have had
   abundance of wine and of food, and you have taken occasion from it to
   grow insolent against God; and therefore you will justly be deprived of
   them, and, instead of your wanton indulgence, wailing and lamentations
   will be heard in the streets."

   All joy is darkened. The metaphor in this second clause deserves
   attention; for, as we say that joy brightens when it obtains its
   object, so the Prophet here says, that "joy is darkened," because
   sorrow may be said to be a cloud drawn over it. To rejoice is not in
   itself evil, any more than to drink; and the Prophet does not censure
   joy simply considered, but excessive and immoderate mirth. When men are
   merry, they lay no restraint on themselves on account of that
   dissoluteness or love of disorder (ataxian) which is natural to them.
   The Jews, having behaved insolently and lived luxuriously, are
   deservedly threatened with the vengeance of God, because most justly is
   joy taken from us when we know not how to make a right use of the
   Lord's benefits, or to rejoice in him. It thus becomes necessary that
   he should take away our pleasures and delights, and compel us to sigh
   and groan.

   12. In the city is left desolation. By an elegant mode of expression he
   describes the desolation of Jerusalem or of many other cities. The
   ornament and perfection of cities consists of men; and therefore, when
   their inhabitants have been removed, cities are said to be deserted.
   The Prophet says ironically, that "ruin" will be left; but the word smh
   (shammah) is rendered by others desolation, which amounts to the same
   thing.

   And the gate is smitten with desolation. He mentions the gates, because
   in them the crowded population of the city was seen, for there the
   people assembled, and there the courts of justice were held. At first,
   therefore, he mentions the whole city, and next he names one part of
   it, but for the purpose of setting the matter in a stronger light; for
   although cities be deprived of their inhabitants, yet some are to be
   seen in the gates; but if the gates be altogether empty, there must be
   grievous solitude in the whole city.

   13. For it shall be in the midst of the land. As this statement is
   inserted between the threatenings and the consolation, the Prophet
   appears to address the chosen people, and not all the nations
   indiscriminately; if we do not rather say that he describes the
   dispersion, by which the Jews were divided, as it were, into many
   nations. But this being a harsh and forced interpretation, I interpret
   it as simply meaning that some hope is left to the ruined nations, and
   certainly this prediction applies strictly to the kingdom of Christ;
   and therefore we need not wonder that some part of the salvation is
   also promised to the Gentiles.

   As the shaking of an olive-tree. The Prophet has elsewhere used the
   same metaphor, but it was when he spoke of the Church alone. (Isaiah
   17:5, 6.) On that occasion he said that some seed of God would be left,
   that believers might not think that the Church was utterly ruined; for
   when "the olives are shaken," still a few olives are left, and some
   grapes after the vintage; and in like manner, after the terrible
   destruction which shall fall upon the Church, a small number of the
   godly will be left. But now he extends the same promise to other parts
   of the world, as they were to become partakers of the same grace
   through Christ. Yet there is still a mixture of threatening; as if he
   had said, that the earth will be deprived of its inhabitants in exactly
   the same manner as the trees and vines are stripped of their fruits.

   14. They shall lift up their voice. He follows out and increases the
   consolations which he had briefly sketched; for, having formerly
   (Isaiah 10:19-22) said that, out of that vast multitude, a few drops
   would be left, which would nevertheless overflow the whole world, in
   like manner he now says, that the small number of the godly, which
   shall be left out of an abundant vintage, will nevertheless rejoice and
   utter a voice so loud that it will be heard in the most distant
   countries. This was done by the preaching of the gospel; for, as to the
   condition of Judea, it appeared to be entirely ruined by it: the
   national government was taken away, and they were broken down by
   foreign and civil wars in such a manner that they never could rise
   above them. The rest of the world was dumb in singing the praises of
   God, and deaf to hear his voice; but as the Jews were the first fruits,
   I shall willingly admit that they are here placed in the highest rank.

   Hence we obtain a remarkable consolation, that the Lord can in a moment
   restore his Church, and make it most flourishing; or rather, he can, as
   it were, create it out of nothing; for even out of death, as we have
   seen, he brings life. Now, this is contrary to nature and to ordinary
   custom, that so small a number of persons should lift up their voice,
   and be heard in distant places; for where there are few persons, there
   is silence, and where there is a crowd, there is commonly a noise. It
   is therefore a work of God, which goes beyond the course of nature and
   the ability of men; for otherwise it would appear as if the Prophet
   uttered what was contradictory, that when the whole of Judea had been
   laid waste and the world had been emptied, there would be few or almost
   none left, and yet that their shouting would be heard everywhere. This
   is in itself incredible, or rather absurd; but, as we have already
   said, it is an astonishing work of God.

   They shall cry aloud from the sea. By those heralds he means not only
   those who were the descendants of the Jews according to the flesh, but
   those who were descended from them by faith. The crying aloud denotes
   not only cheerful voices, expressive of gladness and joy, but likewise
   confidence; for they will freely and boldly utter with a loud voice the
   praises of God. He states, at the same time, that it is right that
   believers should be employed in extolling God's perfections and not
   their own claims to approbation. By the sea, he obviously means distant
   countries, and those which lay beyond the sea and were unknown to the
   Jews.

   15. Wherefore glorify Jehovah in the valleys. [127] God's benefits
   ought to excite us to gratitude, and we testify it by singing his
   praises. "What return shall we make," as David says, "for all the
   benefits which he has bestowed on us, but to take the cup of
   thanksgiving for salvation, and call on the name of the Lord?" The
   Prophet therefore observes this order; having spoken of the restoration
   of the Church, he exhorts us to offer the sacrifice of praise.

   By the valleys, he means countries that are hidden and, as it were,
   separated from others; for those which are surrounded by mountains are
   separated and disjoined by nature. The consequence is, that the
   inhabitants of valleys are less civilized, because they have fewer
   opportunities of conversing with each other. The meaning is the same as
   if the Prophet had said, that there will not be a corner so obscure or
   retired that the praises of God shall not be heard in it.

   The name of Jehovah the God of Israel. He uses the expression, "the
   name of the God of Israel," in order to intimate that all nations will
   call upon the true God; for, as all nations have a knowledge of God
   that is natural to them, so all easily turn aside to superstition and
   false worship. (Romans 1:19.) But here he speaks of spreading the true
   religion through the whole world; and this makes it still more evident
   that the prophecy relates to the kingdom of Christ, under which true
   religion has at length penetrated into foreign and heathen nations.

   16. From the uttermost part [128] of the earth. This verse contains two
   statements which have some appearance of being at variance with each
   other. It begins with a joyful description of the praises of God, and
   next passes on to complaints and lamentations, in which he bewails the
   treachery of transgressors, who overturn religion and godliness. So far
   as relates to praises, we have said that we can neither praise God nor
   call upon him, till he reveal himself to us, and give a taste of his
   goodness, that we may entertain hope and confident expectation of life.
   Hence those sayings of David,

   "In the grave who shall praise thee, O Lord?
   In death who shall confess to thee?" (Psalm 6:5.)

   When we feel nothing but the wrath of God, we are dumb to his praises;
   and therefore when he says that the praises of God will be heard, he
   means that the gospel will be spread through the whole world; that men
   may acknowledge God to be their Father, and may thus break forth into
   his praise. "From the uttermost part" is a phrase that deserves
   attention; for at that time the praises of God were confined to Judea,
   and were not heard at a distance; but afterwards they began to resound
   everywhere. (Psalm 76:1, 2.)

   Glory to the righteous. Some consider this to be spoken by all
   believers, as if the song were, "God is glorified on account of his
   righteousness." Others read the two clauses as one, "We have heard that
   glory is given to the righteous God." Those who think that the heralds
   of God's praises are called "righteous," bring out a very good sense,
   but do not attend to the word "Glory," or at least are constrained to
   render the word tsvy (tzebi) joy. [129] He makes use of the preterite,
   "We have heard," instead of the future tense; and his reason for doing
   so is, that he intended to cheer the hearts of the godly by some
   consolation; "We shall again hear the praises of God;" for this is more
   than if he had said, "They will be heard." He speaks also in the first
   person, in order to include the whole body of the Church, and thus to
   awaken the attention of the godly.

   God is called righteous; and we know that this expression frequently
   occurs in Scripture, but it belongs to him in a different manner from
   that in which it belongs to men; for men are called "righteous," on
   account of the "righteousness" which has been communicated to them; but
   God, who is the fountain of righteousness, is called "righteous," on
   account of what he performs. (Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 7:9; 11:7.) And
   that is a proof of this congratulation and thanksgiving, because from
   the communication of this righteousness we obtain salvation and life;
   and therefore, wherever the righteousness of God is, it must be
   followed by praises and thanksgivings.

   When the Prophet predicted these things, how incredible might they
   appear to be! for among the Jews alone was the Lord known and praised.
   (Psalm 76:2.) To them destruction is foretold, and next the publication
   of the word, and the celebration of the praises of God; but how could
   these things be done, when the people of God had been destroyed? Hence
   we may infer that there were few who believed these predictions. But
   now that those events have taken place, it is our duty to behold with
   admiration so great a miracle of God, because, when the Jews had been
   not only broken down, but almost annihilated, still there flashed from
   them a spark by which the whole world was enlightened, and all who were
   kindled by it burst forth into a confession of the truth.

   My leanness. [130] This passage is explained in various ways; for some
   translate rzy(razi) secret, and others leanness. Those who translate it
   secret understand the Prophet to mean that a double secret has been
   revealed to him, because the Lord has determined to reward the good and
   to punish the wicked; for when men look only at the outward appearance
   of things, and see that the wicked succeed to their wish, and that the
   godly are overwhelmed by afflictions, they are distressed, and doubt
   whether the affairs of men are governed by the hand of God, or all
   things happen by chance; and Solomon shews that thoughts of this kind
   are the seed of ungodliness. (Ecclesiastes 8:11.) On this account the
   Psalmist also says, that he "entered into the sanctuary of God," that
   he might examine the subject in another manner than by human reason.
   (Psalm 73:17.) If we adopt that interpretation, the meaning will be,
   "Though it appear as if there were no reward to the righteous, yet I
   hold this as a secret imparted to me, that it will be well with them;
   and although the wicked think that they will escape, yet I know that
   they will not pass unpunished." But as this ingenuity appears to be too
   far-fetched, I prefer a more simple interpretation; and, besides, there
   immediately follows an interjection expressive of lamentation, 'vy,
   (Oi,) Wo! so that I do not think that Isaiah speaks here about the
   righteous or about their reward.

   Others more correctly explain it leanness; as if he had said, that
   through grief he shrinks and grows lean; for as the prosperous and
   flourishing condition of that people might be called "fatness," so its
   wretched and distressed condition might be called "leanness." Here the
   Prophet stands forth as the representative of the whole race; and when
   the Lord cuts it down, he justly complains of his "leanness." This
   interpretation, I have said, is probable; for when the Prophet saw the
   people diminishing in numbers, he had good reason for bewailing that
   diminution. We know that, when the grace of God was very abundantly
   poured out, the ancient people was greatly diminished, and the
   posterity of Abraham was almost annihilated.

   But we must see if the Prophet does not look farther than to the
   rejection of his nation, so as to bewail the condition of his bowels,
   when he foresees that the Church will be heavily distressed; for rz
   (raz,) which some translate secret, may properly be understood to
   denote the internal part of the body. In this way the exclamation would
   be, "My bowels, or my entrails, are pained;" for in a pathetic
   discourse there is no absurdity in supposing that a word is supplied.
   When the Lord has extended his Church, it appears to be in a
   flourishing state, and free from all danger; but when its very inwards
   or bowels, that is, its own members, give it uneasiness, it is
   grievously tormented. Hypocrites arise, by whom it is more annoyed than
   by enemies who "are without." (Revelation 22:15.)

   Such is also the import of those groanings, 'vy, (Oi,) wo to me; and
   Isaiah, I have no doubt, intended to intimate that the godly should not
   think that they will be happy in this world, but should believe that
   they must maintain a continual strife, even when they might imagine
   that there is nothing to hinder them from enjoying uninterrupted
   tranquillity and peace. He wishes to express the feeling of poignant
   grief which torments the Church inwardly, even in her very bowels; and
   this affliction is the more deeply to be lamented, because it cannot be
   avoided; for, as some one says, the Church can neither flee from
   internal and domestic enemies, nor put them to flight. Isaiah can
   scarcely find terms adequate to express this miserly

   The treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously. These words
   abundantly confirm the expositions which have been already given. How
   heavy this affliction is, and how deeply it ought to be deplored, we
   ourselves have abundantly experienced, and still experience every day.
   Whence arose Popery, and all its corruption, but from this internal
   evil? for it was an imposthume (apostema) bred in the very bowels of
   the Church, which sent forth offensive and diseased matter. How comes
   it also that, when the Church begins to revive, we see doctrine
   corrupted and discipline overturned not only by the common people, but
   by those who ought to have given a good example to others? Is it not
   because the Church is always subject to this evil?

   17 Fear, and the pit, and the snare. The Prophet here discourses
   against the sins of the people. Formerly he declared that not only one
   nation, but very many and very distant nations, would have abundant
   grounds of thanksgiving. He now passes to another doctrine; for I think
   that these words ought to be separated from what goes before, because
   Isaiah again threatens the wicked, that they may know that amidst the
   highest prosperity of the Church they will be miserable. For the sake
   of cherishing their indifference, wicked men are accustomed rashly to
   apply the promises of God to themselves, though they do not at all
   belong to them; and therefore the prophets usually mingle threatenings
   with them. It is also possible that Isaiah delivered this discourse
   separately from the rest, and on a different occasion; for neither the
   prophets themselves nor other learned men divided the chapters. We have
   often seen different subjects joined together, and others divided which
   ought to have been joined, which was undoubtedly done through
   ignorance. However that may be, the Prophet returns to the wicked, and
   threatens against them severe and dreadful judgment.

   This description of "fear, the pit, and the snare," is intended to
   touch the feelings; for if he had said, in a single word, that
   destruction awaits the wicked, they would not have been greatly moved.
   But there is room for doubting if he addresses the Jews alone. For my
   own part, I should not be much inclined to dispute about this matter;
   but I think it is more probable that these threatenings related also to
   other nations, and even to the whole world, of which he had formally
   prophesied.

   O inhabitant of the earth. By "the world" we understand those countries
   which were known to the Jews, as we have already explained. The meaning
   is, "Thou art pressed by afflictions so diversified, that thou hast no
   means of escape." Amos gives a similar description: "He who shall flee
   through dread of a lion shall meet a bear; and if he go into the house,
   when he leaneth on a wall, a serpent shall bite him." (Amos 5:19.)
   Isaiah formerly said that lions would be sent against the Moabites who
   had escaped from the battle. (Isaiah 15:9.) God has an endless variety
   of scourges for punishing the wicked. It is as if he had said, "Know
   that you cannot escape the hand of God; for he has various methods by
   which he takes vengeance on their crimes, and thus overtakes those who
   had hoped to escape by a variety of contrivances. He who escapes from
   the battle shall be tormented with hunger; and when he is freed from
   hunger, he will meet some other calamity, as if nets had been laid on
   all sides to ensnare you."

   For the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth
   are shaken. This argument confirms what had been already said, that it
   is impossible for them to escape the vengeance of God, who has prepared
   for it a free course in heaven and in earth, from the utmost height of
   heaven down to the depths of the earth. Some think that he alludes
   (Genesis 7:11) to the deluge; but, in my opinion, the meaning is
   simpler, that the wrath of God will be revealed above and below; as if
   he had said, "The Lord will arm heaven and earth to execute his
   vengeance against men, that wherever they turn their eyes, they may
   behold nothing but destruction."

   19. By breaking down is the earth broken down. He heightens his
   description of punishments by using various modes of expression. A
   little afterwards he will point out the cause of this "shaking," which
   is, that men by their sins had drawn down on themselves such
   destruction. He now declares that this evil is incurable. We have
   formerly said that the Prophet explains the same thing in various ways,
   and for the purpose of striking and arousing those minds which are
   naturally very sluggish; for there is in the flesh a carelessness which
   produces contempt of God, and we have too much experience of it both in
   ourselves and in others. In order, therefore, that the prophets might
   arouse those who were careless and asleep in their vices, they adorn
   their style; not because they cared about being thought eloquent, but
   that they might make their hearers more attentive, and sting them to
   the quick. Hence the allusions of which these verses are full; hence
   the brilliant metaphors in the style; hence the threatenings and
   terrors announced in various ways; the object of all is, that careless
   men may be aroused.

   Now, this doctrine ought to be limited to the wicked; not because the
   godly are exempted from those evils, for they are afflicted as well as
   other men; but because, when the godly betake themselves to God, and
   rely wholly upon him, they are not shaken in this manner, and remain
   firm and steadfast against every assault; while wicked men, who
   despised the judgments of God, and took unbounded liberties in
   transgression, are terrified and alarmed, and never find rest.

   20. And shall be removed like a tent. This does not mean that any
   change will take place in the position of the earth; but these words,
   as we have already said, must be referred to men; as if he had said,
   that there would be no kingly power and no regular government. In
   short, he intended to describe those changes which he had spoken of in
   the tenth chapter.

   And the transgressions thereof shall be heavy upon it. When he says
   that "the earth is laden with its iniquity," he has very appropriately
   assigned this reason, that we may understand that God is never angry
   with men without a cause; for we ourselves are the authors of all the
   evils which we suffer. God is by nature disposed to kindness, and
   regards us with a father's love; and therefore it is our own fault that
   we are treated with sharpness and severity, and we have no reason to
   blame him. [131]

   And it shall fall, and not rise again. He at length repeats what he
   briefly stated a little before, that there will be no remedy for those
   evils. Some think that this relates to the Jews, whose form of
   government was entirely taken away, so that they were broken down and
   scattered, and were scarcely reckoned in the rank of men. But I give a
   more extensive interpretation, that the distresses of the world will be
   so severe, that it cannot be restored to its original condition. Men
   always contend against adverse events, and their minds are full of
   confidence. Having endured calamities, they think that there will be
   some room for breathing, and their minds are swelled with false hopes,
   which the Prophet therefore takes away, that they may not in future
   deceive themselves by unfounded expectation. Yet it ought to be
   observed, that this general statement does not set aside the exception
   which Isaiah formerly made.

   21. And it shall come to pass. This passage has tortured the minds of
   many commentators, and various interpretations have been offered by
   various writers. Some think that this relates to the sun and the stars,
   and others, that it relates to the devils, who will be punished along
   with the wicked. Others refer it to the Jews, on whom God had bestowed
   a remarkable privilege. But I cannot adopt any of those
   interpretations. [132] The simple and genuine meaning, therefore,
   appears to me to be, that no power will be so high as to be exempted
   from those scourges of God; and though they raise themselves above the
   clouds, yet the hand of God will reach them; as it is said in the
   Psalm,

   "Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? and whither shall I flee from thy
   face? If I ascend into heaven, thou art there; if I take the wings of
   the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, there also
   shall thy hand pursue me." Psalm 139:7-10.

   Jehovah will visit upon the army on high. [133] This is a metaphor by
   which he denotes kings and princes, who shine and sparkle in the world
   like stars; and he afterwards explains this metaphor in direct
   language, by adding upon the kings of the earth; for I do not think
   that they ought to be separated, as if he were speaking of different
   subjects, but that there is a repetition of the same statement, so that
   the latter clause explains the former. But perhaps it will be thought
   preferable to explain it thus: "he will visit on the kingdoms of the
   earth," even on those things which appear to surpass the rank of men;
   for some things rise so much above others, that they appear as if they
   did not belong to the ordinary rank. The word visit must relate to
   punishment, as even the context shews plainly enough.

   22. And they shall be gathered together, and shall be shut up in
   prison. He continues his subject in the beginning of the verse. The
   mode of expression is metaphorical; for they were not all captives, but
   God reduced them to servitude, as if a man held in his hand the enemies
   whom he subdued. He therefore brings forward God as a conqueror, who
   shuts up enemies in prison, as captives are commonly shut up. We know
   that men, as it were, flee from God, and despise him, so long as he
   spares them, and exercises any forbearance towards them; and on this
   account also he threatens that they shall be thrown into prison in
   large masses, that they may not solace themselves with their multitude.

   Afterwards they shall be visited. When he adds that after a time "they
   shall be visited," it is not simply a promise, but includes also a
   threatening to this effect, "As formerly by their obstinacy they mocked
   God, and excessively prolonged the time of sinning, so God will punish
   without making haste, till at length, though late, they acknowledge the
   cause of their distresses." Thus earthly judges frequently do not deign
   to admit into their presence the malefactors who have offended them,
   but plunge them into darkness and filth, and gradually wear them out,
   in order to subdue their obstinacy. Again, as there are two ways in
   which God visits the world, either when he punishes the wicked, or when
   he shews to the elect the tokens of a Father's kindness, the word visit
   here signifies "to look upon;" and thus the Prophet softens the
   harshness of the threatening. It was necessary that the hearts of the
   godly should be supported amidst these distresses, that they might not
   faint; and on their account, therefore, after various threatenings, the
   prophets are wont to add consolations. As these statements tended to
   support believers, they were undoubtedly addressed to the Jews, among
   whom chiefly faith was found, or rather, there was none to be seen
   anywhere else.

   After many days. This also deserves attention. It was intended to try
   the faith of the godly; [134] for we are hasty in our desires, and
   would wish that God should immediately perform his promises: we
   complain that he is slow, and we cannot brook any delay. It is
   therefore our duty to wait patiently for that mercy; and no delay,
   however long, should make us lose heart. Yet it ought also to be
   observed, that this does not refer to all; for, as we saw a little
   before, God had determined to save but a small remnant; and this ought
   to quicken us the more, that, being humbled by slow and long-continued
   punishments, we may meet God who visits us.

   23. The moon shall be confounded. Many commentators think that the
   Prophet waxes still more wroth against the Jews, so far as to say, that
   the sun and moon and stars are ashamed of their unbelief, and that not
   only men, but creatures devoid of speech, will abhor them; but this
   appears to be far removed from the meaning and design of the Prophet. I
   have no doubt that he continues to give the consolation which he had
   glanced at in the former verse; "When the Lord shall visit his people,
   and cleanse the Church from its defilement, he will establish a kingdom
   so illustrious that it will darken the sun and stars by its
   brightness." This mode of expression is frequently employed by the
   prophets, and we have formerly seen it. Since, therefore, God will
   establish your kingdom on Mount Zion, so great will be its splendor in
   the restoration of the people, that those things which dazzle the eyes
   of men, will be dark in comparison of it; and, for the purpose of
   expressing this, he has mentioned those objects which surpass all
   others in brightness.

   When the Lord of hosts shall reign in Mount Zion. Some think that the
   word reign denotes God's vengeance; but this is inaccurate, for
   although the Lord is said to reign when he discharges the office of a
   Judge, yet the complex phrase, "the reign of God in Mount Zion," always
   denotes mercy and salvation. He speaks of the restoration of the
   Church, and hence it follows, that it is only in Christ that those
   things are fulfilled.

   And before his elders glory. By expressly mentioning the "elders," he
   employs a figure of speech frequently used in Scripture, by which the
   chief part of the Church is taken for the whole body of it. And yet it
   is not without a special design that he denotes, by the term "elders,"
   not only the priests, but other governors who preside over discipline
   and morals, and by whose moderation and prudence others ought to be
   guided. Under their name he includes the whole nation, not only because
   they represent the whole body, and because the common people are in
   some measure concealed under their shadow, but likewise that believers
   may entertain hope of future restoration; for otherwise it would have
   been of little or no avail that a scattered multitude should be left
   like a mutilated body or a confused mass. Not without good reason did
   he use the phrase, "and before his elders," that the Jews might know
   that the power of God would be visibly and strikingly displayed; not
   that it can be perceived by the bodily senses, but by faith. He reigns
   in such a manner, that we feel that he is present with us; and if we
   did not comprehend this, it would yield us no consolation.

   Glory. [135] Instead of "glory" some read "gloriously," and others,
   "glorious." I prefer to take it simply as a substantive, though there
   is little difference in the meaning. He shews how great will be the
   splendor and glory of God, when the kingdom of Christ shall be
   established, because all that is brilliant must be obscured, and the
   glory of Christ alone must hold a high and prominent place. Hence it
   follows, that then only does God receive his just rights, and the honor
   due to him, when all creatures are placed in subjection, and he alone
   shines before our eyes.

   diversity of opinion about the application of the term righteous in
   this passage. Many commentators agree with Calvin in thinking that God
   is here called righteous. Bishop Stock has slightly modified this view
   by applying the designation to the Messiah. "By the righteous," says
   he, "is probably meant one person the Messiah, (see Acts 7:52, 22:14,)
   whose kingdom the Prophet beholds in vision, and joins in the chorus of
   joy at its approach; a joy, however, which is presently interrupted by
   a reflection on the wickedness of the greater part of his countrymen at
   that time, who should reject the Lord that bought them. Therefore he
   saith, Woe is me! destruction shall overtake the inhabitants of the

   heavenly bodies worshipped in Assyria. Gesenius finds here an allusion
   to the punishment of fallen angels, and then makes this a proof of

   Isaiah Chapter 25:1-12

   1. O Lord, thou art my God: I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name:
   for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are
   faithfulness and truth.

   1. Iehova Deus meus es tu; exaltabo te: celebrabor nomin tuum; quia
   fecisti rem mirificam; consilia iam olim decreta, veritatem firmam.

   2. For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin: a
   palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.

   2. Quia posuisti ex urbe acervum, urbem munitam in ruinam; palatium
   extraneorum, ut non sit civitas, nec unquam ædificetur.

   3. Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the
   terrible nations shall fear thee.

   3. Propterea glorificabit te populus fortis; civitas gentium robustarum
   timebit te.

   4. For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy
   in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when
   the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.

   4. Nam fuisti fortitudo pauperi; fortitudo, inquam, egeno in
   afflictione ejus; refugium ab inundatione, umbra ab æstu, quia spiritus
   fortium (aut, violentorum) quasi turbo (vel, inundatio) contra murum.

   5. Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry
   place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the
   terrible ones shall be brought low.

   5. Sicut æstum in arido, strepitum alienorum humiliabis, æstum in umbra
   nubis; clamorem (vel, cantum, vel, excisionem) fortium humiliabit.

   6. And in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a
   feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees; of fat things full
   of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.

   6. Et faciet Iehova exercituum cunctis populis in monte isto convivium
   pinguium, convivium defecatorum; pinguium, inquam, medullatorum;
   defecatorum liquidorum.

   7. And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast
   over all people, and the veil that is spread over all nations.

   7. Et destruet in monte isto faciem involucri quo involuti sunt populi
   omnes, et operimentum quad expansum est super omnes gentes.

   8. He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away
   tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take
   away from off all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it.

   8. Destruxit mortem in æternum. Et absterget Dominus Iehova lachrymam a
   cunctis faciebus, et opprobrium populi sui auferet ab universa terra;
   quia Iehova locutus est.

   9. And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have
   waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited
   for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

   9. Et dicetur in die illa: Ecce Deus noster iste; expectavimus eum, et
   salvabit nos. Iste Iehova; expectavimus eum, exultabimus, et lætabimur
   in salute ejus.

   10. For in this mountain shall the hand of the Lord rest, and Moab
   shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the
   dunghill.

   10. Nam quiescet manus Iehovæ in monte isto; et triturabitur Moab
   subter eum, sicut trituratur palea in sterquilinio.

   11. And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he
   that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim; and he shall bring
   down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.

   11. Et extendet manum suam sub medio ejus, sicut extendit natator ad
   natandum; et humiliabit superbiam ejus, cum brachiis manuum suarum.

   12. And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down,
   lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.

   12. Et munitionem sublimitatis murorum tuorum sternet, humiliabit,
   dejiciet in terram, ad pulverem.


   1. O Lord, thou art my God. Hitherto Isaiah has prophesied about the
   judgments of God, which threatened not only a single nation, but almost
   the whole world. Now, it was impossible that the contemplation of
   calamities so dismal as those which he foresaw should not give him
   great uneasiness; for godly persons would desire that all mankind
   should be saved, and, while they honor God, they desire also to love
   all that belongs to him; and, in short, so far as any man sincerely
   fears God, he has a powerful and lively feeling of the divine
   judgments. While wicked men stand amazed at the judgments of God, and
   are not moved by any terror, godly men tremble at the slightest token
   of his anger. And if this be the case with us, what do we suppose was
   experienced by the Prophet, who had almost before his eyes those
   calamities which he foretold? For, in order that the ministers of the
   word might be convinced of the certainty of what they taught, it was
   necessary that they should be more powerfully impressed by it than the
   generality of men.

   Since therefore the Lord held out to Isaiah, as in a picture, those
   dreadful calamities, he found it necessary, under the overpowering
   influence of grief and anxiety, to betake himself to the Lord;
   otherwise the confused emotions of his mind would have agitated him
   beyond measure. He therefore takes courage from the belief that, in the
   midst of these tempests, the Lord still determines to promote the
   advantage of his Church, and to bring into subjection to himself those
   who were formerly estranged. Isaiah therefore remains firm and
   steadfast in his calling, and does not allow himself to be drawn aside
   from his purpose, but continually relies on the expectation of mercy,
   and therefore perseveres in celebrating the praises of God. Thus we
   learn that this thanksgiving is connected with the former prophecies,
   and that Isaiah considers not only what he foretold, but why the Lord
   did it; that is, why the Lord afflicted so many nations with various
   calamities. It was, that he might subdue those who were formerly
   incorrigible, and who rushed forward with brutal eagerness, who had no
   fear of God, and no feeling of religion or godliness.

   Thou art my God. Being as it were perplexed and confused, he suddenly
   raises his thoughts to God, as we have already said. Hence we ought to
   draw a very useful doctrine, namely, that when our minds are perplexed
   by a variety of uneasy thoughts on account of numerous distresses and
   afflictions which happen daily, we ought immediately to resort to God,
   and rely on his providence; for even the smallest calamities will
   overwhelm us, if we do not betake ourselves to him, and support our
   hearts by this doctrine. In order to bring out more fully the meaning
   of the Prophet, the word but or nevertheless may be appropriately
   inserted in this manner: "Whatever temptations from that quarter may
   disturb me, nevertheless I will acknowledge thee to be my God." Thus he
   promises that he will give to God the praise which is due to him; and
   this cannot be, unless a firm belief of his grace dwell in our hearts,
   and hold a superiority, from which grace springs a joy, which yields to
   us the most abundant ground for praises, when we are certain of our
   salvation, and are fully convinced that the Lord is our God.
   Accordingly, those who are influenced by no desire to praise God, have
   not believed and have not tasted the goodness of God; for if we
   actually trust in God, we must be led to take great delight in praising
   his name.

   For thou hast done a wonderful thing. He uses the word phl', (pElE,)
   wonderful, in the singular number instead of the plural. The Prophet
   does not confine his view to the present appearance of things, but
   looks to the end; for even men who in other respects are heathens,
   behold in the government of the world astonishing events, the sight of
   which overwhelms them with amazement; which undoubtedly happened to the
   inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon, and to the Babylonians and Moabites. But
   those only who have tasted his goodness and wisdom can profit by the
   works of God; for otherwise they undervalue and despise his works, and
   do not comprehend their excellence, because they do not perceive their
   end, which is, that God, wonderfully bringing light out of darkness, (2
   Corinthians 4:6,) raises his Church from death to life, and regulates
   in the best manner, and directs to the most valuable purpose, those
   things which to the eye of man appear to be confused.

   Counsels which have been already decreed of old. [136] Now, in order to
   bestow still higher commendation on the providence of God, he adds,
   that the "counsels have been already decreed of old;" as if he had
   said, that to God nothing is sudden or unforeseen. And indeed, though
   he sometimes appears to us to act suddenly, yet all things were
   undoubtedly ordained by him before the creation of the world. (Acts
   15:18.) By this word, therefore, the Apostle means that all the
   miracles which happen contrary to the expectation of men, are the
   result of that regular order which God maintains in governing the
   world, arranging all things from the beginning to the end. Now, since
   we do not understand those secret decrees, and our powers of
   understanding cannot rise so high, our attention must therefore be
   directed to the manifestation of them; for they are concealed from us,
   and exceed our comprehension, till the Lord reveal them by his word, in
   which he accommodates himself to our weakness; for his decree is
   (anexeureton) unsearchable.

   Firm truth. [137] From the eternal decrees of God the Prophet thus
   proceeds to doctrines and promises, which he undoubtedly denotes by the
   word truth; for the repetition would be frivolous, if this word did not
   signify a relation; because, when God has revealed to us his purpose,
   if we believe his sayings, he then appears to be actually true. He
   commends the firmness and certainty of the word, when he says that it
   is "steadfast truth;" that is, that everything that comes from God,
   everything that is declared by him, is firm and unchangeable.

   2. For thou hast made of a city a heap. Some refer this to Jerusalem;
   but I think that there is a change of the number, as is very customary
   with the prophets; for the Prophet does not speak merely of a single
   city, but of many cities, which he says will be reduced to heaps. As to
   the view held by some, that the Romans made Jerusalem a palace, it has
   nothing to do with the Prophet's meaning, which will be easily enough
   understood, if we keep in remembrance what has been already stated,
   that the Prophet does not confine his thoughts to those calamities by
   which the Lord afflicts many nations, but extends his view to the end
   of the chastisements. In this manner the Lord determined to tame and
   subdue the obstinacy of men, whom he would never have brought into
   subjection to him without having been broken down by various
   afflictions.

   A palace of foreigners, [138] that it may not be a city. The Prophet
   does not merely mean that, when the natives have been driven out,
   "foreigners" wil1 inhabit the cities which have been taken; for that
   would not agree with what he immediately adds, "that it may be no
   longer a city;" but that wandering bands of men who shall be in want of
   a habitation will there find abundance of room, because there will be
   no inhabitants left. Since 'rmvn (armOn) denotes a magnificent palace,
   the Prophet thus says ironically, that highwaymen will dwell as in
   palaces, on account of the vast extent of the place which shall be
   deserted.

   3. Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee. This is the end
   which I mentioned; [139] for if the Lord should destroy the world, no
   good result would follow, and indeed destruction could produce no
   feeling but horror, and we would never be led by it to sing his praise;
   but, on the contrary, we must be deprived of all feeling, when we
   perceive nothing but wrath. But praises flow from a sense of grace and
   goodness. It is therefore as if he had said, "Thou wilt not only strike
   and afflict, O Lord, but wilt cause the chastisements to be not without
   effect; for by them thou wilt subdue the fierceness of men, so that
   those who were formerly estranged from thee shall bend their neck to
   thee." This passage should lead us to observe how much we need
   chastisements, which train us to obedience to God; for we are carried
   away by prosperity to such an extent, that we think that we have a
   right to do anything, and we even grow wanton and insolent when God
   treats us with gentleness.

   The city of the terrible nations shall fear thee. When the Prophet next
   mentions fear, he shews that this praise does not consist in words or
   outward gestures, but in the sincere feeling of the heart. Hence we
   infer that he now speaks of the entire worship of God; but, as many
   persons think that they have fully discharged their duty, as soon as
   they have made a confession with the mouth, he adds, for the sake of
   explanation, "The nations shall fear thee." When he calls them strong
   and powerful, by these epithets he denotes their pride and arrogance;
   for they were elated by their prosperity. They rebel against God, and
   cannot be made humble or submissive, unless they have been deprived of
   all things. To such views, therefore, ought our thoughts to be directed
   amidst those calamities which we perceive. The fierceness of men must
   be restrained and subdued, that they may be prepared for receiving
   doctrine and for rendering true obedience. So long as they shall be
   blinded by their wealth and vain confidence, they will fearlessly mock
   at the judgments of God, and will never yield subjection to him.

   4. For thou hast been a strength to the poor. Hence we see the fruit of
   conversion, namely, that the Lord raises us from the dead, and brings
   us, as it were, out of the grave, stretching out his hand to us from
   heaven, to rescue us even from hell. This is our first access to him,
   for it is only in our poverty that he finds the means of exercising his
   kindness. To us in our turn, therefore, it is necessary that we be poor
   and needy, that we may obtain assistance from him; and we must lay
   aside all reliance and confidence in ourselves, before he display his
   power in our behalf. This is the reason why he visits us with
   chastisements and with the cross, by which he trains us, so that we may
   be able to receive his assistance and grace.

   A refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat. It is not without good
   reason that Isaiah adorns this description by these comparisons; for
   numerous and diversified temptations arise, and, in order to bear them
   courageously, it is necessary that the weak minds of men should be
   strengthened and fortified. On this account he says that God will be "a
   strength to the poor, a refuge from the storms, and a shadow from the
   heat;" because, whatever may be the nature of the dangers and assaults
   which threaten them, the Lord will protect his people against them, and
   will supply them with every kind of armor.

   The breath of the strong or of the violent ones. In this passage, as in
   many others, (Genesis 8:1; Exodus 15:10; 1 Kings 19:11,) rvch (ruach)
   signifies "the blowing of the wind," and denotes the tremendous
   violence with which wicked men are hurried along against the children
   of God; for not only do they "breathe out threatenings and terrors,"
   (Acts 9:1,) but they appear to vomit out fire itself.

   A storm or flood against the wall. This is to the same purport as the
   former; for by this figure he means, that wicked men, when they obtain
   liberty to do mischief, rush on with such violence that they throw down
   everything that comes in their way, for to overthrow and destroy walls
   is more than if the water were merely flowing over the fields.

   5. As the heat in a dry place. If the Lord did not aid when violent men
   rush upon us, our life would be in imminent danger; for we see how
   great is the rage of wicked men, and if the Lord overturn walls, what
   can a feeble man do against him? These things therefore are added in
   order to magnify the grace of God, that we may consider what would
   become of us if the Lord did not render assistance.

   Yet there are two ways in which commentators explain this passage. Some
   understand it to mean, that wicked men will be consumed by God's
   indignation, in the same manner as the violence of the heat burns up
   the fields which are in themselves barren. Others render it in the
   ablative case, As if by heat, and make the meaning to be, "Though
   wicked men, relying on their power, are so violent, yet the Lord will
   prostrate them in a moment, as if they were overpowered by heat in a
   dry place.'" But I consider the meaning to be different, for, after
   having shewn how great is the rage of wicked men against believers, he
   adds:

   Thou wilt bring them down, O Lord. Alluding to the metaphor of the
   deluge, which he had formerly used, he says, "Thou wilt quench their
   heat, which would otherwise consume us, even as rain, or a shower,
   falling from heaven, quenches the heat that scorched the thirsty
   fields." And thus the passage flows naturally; for the other
   interpretation is forced, and does violence, as the saying is, to the
   letter.

   The noise of the strong ones will he lay low. [140] This clause is
   tortured in various ways. Some think that zmyr (zEmir) means seed;
   others that it means a root; as if he had said, that God will not only
   destroy wicked men, but will utterly root them out. This meaning would
   be probable, were it not opposed by the metaphor of the heat. In my
   opinion, therefore, it is more correctly interpreted by others to mean
   "singing and shouting," or "cutting off," although even those
   interpreters do not fully succeed in getting at the meaning of the
   Prophet. He therefore confirms the preceding statement, that the
   violence of wicked men, or the shouting which they haughtily and
   daringly set up, will presently be laid low, as the heat of the sun is
   overpowered by the falling rain, which is meant by the shadow of a
   cloud

   6. And the Lord of hosts shall make. This passage has received various
   interpretations. Some think that the Prophet threatens the Jews, and
   threatens them in such a manner as to invite various nations to a
   banquet. This mode of expression is also found in other passages, for
   the Lord is said to fatten the wicked for the day of slaughter. Those
   commentators think that, as if the Jews were exposed as a prey to the
   Gentiles on account of their impiety, the Gentiles are invited to a
   banquet; as if the Lord had said, "I have prepared a splendid
   entertainment for the Gentiles; the Romans shall plunder and prey on
   the Jews." But, in my opinion, that view of the passage cannot be
   admitted, nor will it be necessary for me to give a long refutation of
   it, after having brought forward the true interpretation. Others
   explain it as if Isaiah were speaking of the wrath of God in this
   manner, "The Lord will prepare a banquet for all nations; he will give
   to them to drink the cup of his anger, that they may be drunken."

   But the Prophet had quite a different meaning, for he proceeds in
   making known the grace of God, which was to be revealed by the coming
   of Christ. He employs the same metaphor which is also used by David,
   when he describes the kingdom of Christ, and says, that

   "the poor and the rich will sit down at this feast,
   and will eat and be satisfied." (Psalm 22:26, 29.)

   By this metaphorical language he means, that no class of men will be
   excluded from partaking of this generous provision. Formerly it seemed
   as if the Lord nourished the Jews only, because they alone were
   adopted, and, as it were, invited to the feast provided for his family;
   but now he admits the Gentiles also, and extends his beneficence to all
   nations.

   Will make for all nations a feast of fat things. This is an implied
   contrast when he says, to all nations, for formerly he was known to one
   nation only. (Psalm 76:1.) By "a feast of fat things" is meant a
   banquet consisting of animals that have been well fattened.

   Of liquids purified. [141] Some render the Hebrew word smrym,
   (shEmarim,) dregs, but inaccurately, for it means "old wines," such as
   the French call, vins de garde, "wines that have been long kept," and
   that are preferable to ordinary wines, especially in an eastern
   country, where they carry their age better. He calls them liquids which
   contain no dregs or sediment.

   In short, it is sufficiently evident that he does not here threaten
   destruction against Gentiles or Jews, but that both are invited
   together to a very splendid banquet. This is still more evident from
   Christ's own words, when he compares the kingdom of heaven to a
   marriage-feast which the King prepared for his Son, to which he invites
   all without exception, because those who were at first invited refused
   to come. (Matthew 22:2, 3.) Nor have I any doubt that he speaks of the
   preaching of the gospel; and as it proceeded from Mount Zion, (Isaiah
   2:3,) he says that the Gentiles will come to it to feast; for when God
   presents to the whole world spiritual food for feeding souls, the
   meaning was the same as if he had prepared a table for all. The Lord
   invites us at the present day, that he may fill and satisfy us with
   good things; he raises up faithful ministers to prepare for us that
   feast, and gives power and efficacy to his word, that we may be
   satisfied with it. [142]

   In this mountain. As to the word mountain, though the servants of God
   do not now come out of the mountain to feed us, yet by this name we
   must understand the Church; for nowhere else can any one partake of
   this food. That feast is not set down in streets and highways, the
   table is not spread everywhere, and this banquet is not prepared in all
   places. In order that we may feast, we must come to the Church. That
   place was mentioned, because there alone God was worshipped, and
   revelations proceeded from it; as also the gospel came forth from it.
   When he says that this banquet will be rich and sumptuous, the design
   of this is to commend the doctrine of the gospel; for it is the
   spiritual food with which our souls are fed, and is so exquisitely
   delightful that we have no need of any other.

   7. And he will destroy the face of the covering. [143] Here also
   commentators differ, for by the word covering is meant the disgrace
   with which believers are covered in this world, so that the glory of
   God is not seen in them; as if he had said, "Though many reproaches
   oppress the godly, yet God will take away those reproaches, and will
   make their condition glorious. I pass by other interpretations; but, in
   my opinion, the true meaning is, that the Lord promises that he will
   take away the veil by which they were kept in blindness and ignorance;
   and therefore it was by the light of the gospel that this darkness was
   dispelled.

   In that mountain. He says that this will be in mount Zion, from which
   also the light of the word shone on the whole world, as we have already
   seen. (Isaiah 2:3.) This passage, therefore, must unavoidably be
   referred to the kingdom of Christ; for the light did not shine on all
   men till Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, arose, (Malachi 4:2,) who
   took away all the veils, wrappings, and coverings. And here we have
   another commendation of the gospel, that it dispels the darkness, and
   takes away from our eyes the covering of errors. Hence it follows, that
   we are wrapped up and blinded by the darkness of ignorance, before we
   are enlightened by the doctrine of the gospel, by which alone we can
   obtain light and life, and be fully restored. Here, too, we have a
   confirmation of the calling of the Gentiles, that is, of our calling;
   for not only the Jews, but all nations, which formerly were buried in
   every kind of errors and superstition, are invited to this banquet.

   8. He hath destroyed death eternally. [144] The Prophet continues his
   subject; for in general he promises that there will be perfect
   happiness under the reign of Christ, and, in order to express this the
   more fully, he employs various metaphors admirably adapted to the
   subject. That happiness is real, and not temporary or fading, which not
   even death can take away; for amidst the highest prosperity our joy is
   not a little diminished by the consideration that it will not always
   last. He therefore connects two things, which render happiness full and
   complete. The first is, that the life is perpetual; for to those who in
   other respects are happy for a time, it is a wretched thing to die. The
   second is, that this life is accompanied by joy; for otherwise it may
   be thought that death would be preferable to a sorrowful and afflicted
   life. He next adds that, when all disgrace has been removed, this life
   will be glorious; for otherwise less confidence would have been placed
   in the prophecy, in consequence of the wretched oppression of the
   people.

   But it is asked, To what period must we refer these promises? for in
   this world we must contend with various afflictions, and must fight
   continually; and not only are we "appointed to death," (Psalm 44:22,)
   but we "die daily." (1 Corinthians 15:31.) Paul complains of himself
   and the chief pillars of the Church, that they are "a spectacle to all
   men," and endure insults of every kind, and are even looked upon as
   (katharmata) "cleansings" and (peripsemata) "sweepings," or
   "offscourings." [145] (1 Corinthians 4:9, 13.) Where or when,
   therefore, are these things fulfilled? They must undoubtedly be
   referred to the universal kingdom of Christ; -- universal, I say,
   because we must look not only at the beginning, but also at the
   accomplishment and the end: and thus it must be extended even to the
   second coming of Christ, which on that account is called "the day of
   redemption" and "the day of restoration;" because all things which now
   appear to be confused shall be fully restored, and assume a new form.
   (Luke 21:28; Acts 3:21; Romans 8:23; Ephesians 4:30.) This prediction
   relates, no doubt, to the deliverance from Babylon; but as that
   deliverance might be regarded as the earnest and foretaste of another,
   this promise must undoubtedly be extended to the last day.

   Let us therefore direct all our hope and expectation to this point, and
   let us not doubt that the Lord will fulfill all these things in us when
   we have finished our course. If we now "sow in tears," then undoubtedly
   we shall "reap with joy" and ecstasy. (Psalm 126:5.) Let us not dread
   the insults or reproaches of men, which will one day procure for us the
   highest glory. Having obtained here the beginnings of this happiness
   and glory, by being adopted by God, and beginning to bear the image of
   Christ, let us firmly and resolutely await the completion of it at the
   last day.

   For Jehovah hath spoken it. After so many dreadful calamities, it might
   be thought that such an event was incredible; and therefore the Prophet
   shews that it proceeds not from man, but from God. When Jerusalem had
   been overthrown, the worship of God taken away, the temple destroyed,
   and the remnant of the people oppressed by cruel tyranny, no man would
   have believed it to be possible that everything would be raised to its
   original condition. It was necessary to combat with this distrust, to
   which men are strongly inclined; and therefore the Prophet confirms and
   seals these promises.

   "Know that God communicated to me these declarations; fix your minds
   therefore on him, and not on me; let your faith rely on him who cannot
   lie' or deceive."
   (Titus 1:2.)

   9. And it shall be said. The verb 'mr (amar) is indefinite, "He shall
   say;" but as the discourse does not relate to one or another
   individual, but to all in general, I chose to render it in a passive
   form. [146] This is an excellent conclusion; for it shews that God's
   benefits are not in any respect doubtful or uncertain, but are actually
   received and enjoyed by men. The Prophet declares that the banquet, of
   which he formerly spoke, ([17]verse 6,) will not in vain be prepared by
   God; for men shall feast on it, and possess everlasting joy.

   Lo, this is our God. That joyful shout, which he declares will be
   public, is the actual test and proof, so to speak, of the experience of
   the grace of God. This passage ought to be carefully observed; for the
   Prophet shews that there will be such a revelation as shall fix the
   minds of men on the word of God, so that they will rely on it without
   any kind of hesitation; and if these things belong, as they undoubtedly
   do belong, to the kingdom of Christ, we derive from them this valuable
   fruit, that Christians, unless they are wanting to themselves, and
   reject the grace of God, have undoubted truth on which they may safely
   rely. God has removed all ground of doubt, and has revealed himself to
   them in such a manner, that they may venture freely to declare that
   they know with certainty what is his will, and may say with truth what
   Christ said to the Samaritan woman, "We worship what we know." (John
   4:22.) Having been informed by the gospel as to the grace offered
   through Christ, we do not now wander in uncertain opinions, as others
   do, but embrace God and his pure worship. Let us boldly say, "Away with
   all the inventions of men!"

   It is proper to observe the contrast between that dark and feeble kind
   of knowledge which the fathers enjoyed under the law, and the fullness
   which shines forth to us in the gospel. Though God deigned to bestow on
   his ancient people the light of heavenly doctrine, yet he made himself
   more familiarly known through Christ, as we are told;

   "No man hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the
   bosom of the Father, hath declared him." (John 1:18.)

   The Prophet now extols that certainty which the Son of God brought to
   us by his coming, when he "sheweth to us the Father." (John 14:9.) Yet,
   while we excel the ancient people in this respect, that the
   reconciliation obtained through Christ makes God, as it were, more
   gracious to us, there is no other way in which God can be known but
   through Christ, who is "the pattern and image of his substance."
   (Hebrews 1:3.) "He who knoweth not the Son, knoweth not the Father."
   (John 14:7.) Though Jews, Mahometans, and other infidels, boast that
   they worship God, the creator of heaven and earth, yet they worship an
   imaginary God. However obstinate they may be, they follow doubtful and
   uncertain opinions instead of the truth; they grope in the dark, and
   worship their own imagination instead of God. In short, apart from
   Christ, all religion is deceitful and transitory, and every kind of
   worship ought to be abhorred and boldly condemned.

   Nor is it without good reason that the Prophet employs not only the
   adverb Lo, but the demonstrative pronoun This, [147] in order to attest
   more fully the presence of God, as, a little afterwards, by repeating
   the declaration of certainty and confidence, he expresses the
   steadfastness that will be found in those who shall worship God through
   Christ. It is certain that we cannot comprehend God in his majesty, for
   he "dwelleth in unapproachable light," (1 Timothy 6:16,) which will
   immediately overpower us, if we attempt to rise to it; and therefore he
   accommodates himself to our weakness, gives himself to us through
   Christ, by whom he makes us partakers of wisdom, righteousness, truth,
   and other blessings. (1 Corinthians 1:30.)

   This is Jehovah. It is worthy of observation that, when he calls Christ
   the God of believers, he gives to him the name "Jehovah;" from which we
   infer that the actual eternity of God belongs to the person of Christ.
   Besides, since Christ has thus made himself known to us by the gospel,
   this proves the base ingratitude of those who, not satisfied with so
   full a manifestation, have dared to add to it their own idle
   speculation, as has been done by Popery.

   We have waited for him. He expresses the firmness and perseverance of
   those who have once embraced God in Christ; for it ought not to be a
   temporary knowledge, but we must persevere in it steadfastly to the
   end. Now, Isaiah speaks in the name of the ancient Church, which at
   that time had its seat, strictly speaking, among the Jews alone; and
   therefore, despising as it were all the gods that were worshipped in
   other countries, he boldly declares that he alone, who revealed himself
   to Abraham, (Genesis 15:1,) and proclaimed his law by the hand of
   Moses, (Exodus 20:1, 2,) is the true God. Other nations, which were
   involved in the darkness of ignorance, did not "wait for" the Lord: for
   this "waiting" springs from faith, which is accompanied by patience,
   and there is no faith without the word.

   Thus he warns believers that their salvation rests on hope and
   expectation; for the promises of God were as it were suspended till the
   coming of Christ. Besides, we ought to observe what was the condition
   of those times; for it appeared as if either the promise of God had
   come to nought, or he had rejected the posterity of Abraham. Certainly,
   though they looked very far, God did not at that time appear to them;
   and therefore they must have been endued with astonishing patience to
   endure such heavy and sharp temptations. Accordingly, he bids them wait
   quietly for the coming of Christ; for then they will clearly perceive
   how near God is to them that worship him.

   The same doctrine ought to soothe us in the present day, so that,
   though our salvation be concealed, still we may "wait for the Lord"
   with firm and unshaken hope, and, when he is at a distance, may always
   say, Lo, here he is. In times of the greatest confusion, let us learn
   to distinguish him by this mark, This is he. [148] As to the words,
   though he says, in the past tense, [149] "We rejoiced and were glad in
   his salvation;" yet the words denote a continued act; and, a little
   before, he had said in the future tense, "He will save us." The meaning
   may be thus summed up, "Christ will never disappoint the hopes of his
   people, if they call on him with patience."

   10. For the hand of Jehovah shall rest. The design of the Prophet in
   the beginning of this verse, I have no doubt, was to comfort the godly,
   who but for this would have thought that God had forsaken and abandoned
   them; for the opinion of those who view it as describing the judgment
   which the Lord was about to execute on the Jews, has no foundation
   whatever; but the meaning is the same as if he had said, that the Lord
   will always assist his Church. I am aware that "the hand of God" rests
   also on the reprobate, when he does not cease to pursue them with his
   vengeance, till he completely overwhelm them; but here the word "hand"
   denotes assistance, and not chastisements, and therefore by the word
   "rest," is meant the uninterrupted continuance of defense or
   protection.

   We draw from this a profitable doctrine, that although God scatters
   innumerable blessings over the whole world, in such a manner that
   wicked men also obtain a share of them, yet his "hand" does not "rest,"
   or is not continually present, but in the holy mountain; that is, in
   the Church, where he is worshipped. It ought also to be observed, that
   Jerusalem had been chastised, before she received these blessings; for
   he had formerly threatened chastisements and punishments, to which he
   added this consolation.

   And Moab shall be trodden down under him. In this clause he gives an
   additional view of the grace of God; for, by inflicting punishment on
   the enemies of the Church, he will shew how dearly he values its
   salvation. The Jews had no enemies more deadly than the Moabites,
   though their ancestors [150] were near relatives. By a figure of speech
   (sunekdochikos) in which a part is taken for the whole, he includes
   under this name all the enemies of the Church, and especially those who
   are somewhat related to them, and who are more destructive than all
   others. He shews that, though for a time they are victorious and
   oppress the Church, yet eventually they shall be punished. His object
   is, that under their afflictions believers may not lose heart, as if
   their condition were unhappy, while wicked men are cheerful and
   prosperous; for the "treading down," which is here mentioned, will
   quickly follow. Consequently, if at the present day we see the Church
   disturbed and oppressed by those who are somewhat related to us, and
   who even assume the name and title of the Church, let us comfort our
   hearts by this promise.

   As straw is trodden down in the dunghills. [151] The word mdmnh,
   (Madmenah,) which we translate "dunghill," [152] is supposed by some to
   be the name of a city, which is also mentioned by Jeremiah, (Jeremiah
   48:2.) But what if we should say that the Prophet alludes to the city,
   which was probably situated in a fertile soil, and thus conveys a
   stronger censure, and presses harder on the Moabites? As if he had
   said, "As straw is trodden down in their fields, so will the Lord tread
   down the Moabites." I do not dislike other interpretations, but
   consider it to be not improbable that he alludes to the fertility of
   the soil in which that city was situated. Yet in my version I have not
   hesitated to follow the common opinion.

   11. And he shall spread out. The Prophet now explains and confirms the
   former statement; but he employs a different metaphor, by which he
   means, that the Lord will spread out his hand to the innermost part of
   the country of Moab, and not merely to its extremities. Some explain
   the metaphor thus: "As the arms are stretched out in swimming, so the
   Lord will chastise the Moabites on all sides." Others think that it
   expresses the doubling of punishments, as if he had said, "The Lord
   will not only punish the Moabites, but will again and again take
   vengeance for the cruelty which they exercised against the children of
   God."

   But we might take another way of explaining that metaphor. Those who
   swim do not rush forward with the utmost violence, but gently spread
   out and quickly draw back their arms, and yet they cut and subdue the
   waters. In like manner, the Lord does not always put forth great
   strength to cut down the wicked, but without any effort, without the
   use of armies, without any noise or uproar, he destroys and puts them
   to flight, however valiant or well prepared for battle they may appear
   to be. And I approve of this explanation, because it takes nothing from
   the meaning formerly given, and explains more clearly, that the wicked
   are often brought to nothing by the hand of God, though he do not
   openly thunder from heaven. When he says, "In the midst of it," he
   shews that no part will be hidden in such a manner as not to be
   overtaken by this vengeance.

   12. And the fortress. The Prophet now directs his discourse to the
   country of Moab. It was highly fortified, and was proud of its walls
   and fortifications; and he affirms that the lofty towers, and other
   defences, however strong and seemingly impregnable, will be of no
   avail. The ancients, it is well known, had quite a different method of
   fortifying from what is practiced among us.

   He will bring down, lay low, and cast to the ground. The three words
   here employed, for conveying the meaning more strongly, are not
   superfluous; for it was necessary to beat down that pride which swelled
   the hearts of the Moabites, and which, as we formerly saw, [153] made
   them intolerable. The Prophet therefore mocks at them, "As if the Lord
   could not cast down that loftiness of which you boast!"

   To the dust. The meaning of this clause is as if he had said, "He will
   not only level it with the ground, but will reduce it to dust, so that
   there will not even be a trace of the ancient ruin." This passage
   contains an excellent and highly seasonable consolation; for the
   enemies of the Church in the present day are so haughty, that they mock
   not only at men, but at God himself, and are so much swelled and puffed
   up by their power, that they imagine themselves to be invincible; but,
   in opposition to their bulwarks and defences, we ought to bring forward
   this declaration of the Prophet, "The Lord will quickly bring down and
   lay them low." Yet we must patiently endure to see them strong and
   powerful, till the full time for their destruction arrive.

   Isaiah Chapter 26:1-21

   1. In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a
   strong city: salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.

   1. In die illa cantabitur canticum in terra Iuda: Urbs fortitudinis
   nobis; salutem posuit muros et vallum.

   2. Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth
   may enter in.

   2. Aperite portas, et ingredietur gens justa, custodiens veritates.

   3. Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee;
   because he trusteth in thee.

   3. Cogitatio fixa: custodies pacem, pacem; quoniam in te confisum est.

   4. Trust ye in the Lord for ever: for in the Lord Jehovah is
   everlasting strength.

   4. Sperate in Iehova in perpetuum; quia in Iah Iehova fortitudo
   seculorum.

   5. For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he
   layeth it low: he layeth it low, even to the ground; he bringeth it
   even to the dust.

   5. Nam incurvabit incolas sublimitatis, civitatem exaltatam humiliabit;
   humiliabit, inquam, eam ad terram, deducet ad pulverem.

   6. The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the
   steps of the needy.

   6. Calcabit eam pes; pedes pauperis, gressus inopum.

   7. The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh
   the path of the just.

   7. Semita justi rectitudines; rectam viam justi æquabis, (vel, tu, qui
   rectus es, viam justi æquabis.)

   8. Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O Lord, have we waited for thee;
   the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.

   8. Etiam in via judiciorum tuorum, Iehova, speravimus in te, ad nomen
   tuum, et memoriam tui desiderium animæ.

   9. With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit
   within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the
   earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.

   9. Anima mea desideravit te per noctem; quin et spiritu meo intra me te
   mane (vel, sedulo) quæram; nam ex quo fuerint judicia tua in terra,
   justitiam discent incolæ terræ.

   10. Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn
   righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and
   will not behold the majesty of the Lord.

   10. Impius gratiam obtinebit, nec discet justitiam; in terra rectorum
   operum perverse aget, nec videbit magnificentiam Iehovæ.

   11. Lord, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they shall
   see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yea, the fire of
   thine enemies shall devour them.

   11. Iehova, utcunque exaltata fuerit manus tua, non videbunt; videbunt
   et pudefient æmulatione populi; quin et ignis hostium tuorum vorabit
   eos.

   12. Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all
   our works in us.

   12. Iehova, ordinabis nobis pacem; nam et omnia opera nostra operatus
   es nobis.

   13. O Lord our God, other lords besides thee have had dominion over us;
   but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.

   13. Iehova Deus noster, subjugaverunt nos domini præter te; tantum in
   te recordabimur nominis tui.

   14 They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall
   not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all
   their memory to perish.

   14. Mortui non vivent; occisi non resurgent; propterea visitasti, et
   exterminasti eos; et perdidisti omnem memoriam eorum.

   15. Thou hast increased the nation, O Lord, thou hast increased the
   nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far unto all the ends
   of the earth.

   15. Addidisti genti, Iehova; addidisti genti; glorificatus es;
   dilatasti omnes fines terræ.

   16. Lord, in trouble have they visited thee; they poured out a prayer
   when thy chastening was upon them.

   16. Iehova, in tribulatione visitaverunt te, effuderunt precationem,
   dum castigatio tua super eos.

   17. Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her
   delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in
   thy sight, O Lord.

   17. Sicut prægnans, quæ ad partum propinquat, dolet, clamat in
   doloribus suis; sic nos fuimus a facie tua, Iehova.

   18. We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were
   brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth,
   neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.

   18. Parturivimus, doluimus, ac si peperissemus ventum, salus non est
   facta terræ, et non ceciderunt incolæ orbis.

   19. Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they
   arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew
   of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.

   19. Vivent mortui tui, cadaver meum resurgent. Evigilate, et cantate,
   incolæ pulveris. Quoniam ros herbarum ros tuus; et terra mortuos
   ejiciet, (vel, terram Gigantum prosternes; vel, terra Gigantes cadere
   faciet.)

   20. Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors
   about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the
   indignation be overpast.

   20. Veni, popule mi, intra in cubicula tua; claude ostia post te:
   lateas paululum ad momentum, donec transeat indignatio.

   21. For, behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the
   inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall
   disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.

   21. Nam ecce Iehova egreditur e loco suo, ut visitet iniquitatem
   habitatoris terræ contra eum. Et discooperiet terra sanguines suos, et
   non teget amplius super occisis suis.


   1. In that day shall a song be sung. Here the Prophet begins again to
   shew that, after the return of the people from captivity, they will be
   defended by God's power and guardianship, and that under his protection
   Jerusalem will be as safe as if she had been surrounded by bulwarks,
   ramparts, a ditch, and a double wall, so that no enemy could find
   entrance.

   It is proper to observe the time when "this song was sung." The Prophet
   had foretold the calamity that would befall the Church, which was not
   yet so near at hand, but happened a short time after his death. When
   the people were led into captivity, they would undoubtedly have
   despaired, if they had not been encouraged by such promises. That the
   Jews might cherish a hope that they would be delivered, and might
   behold life in the midst of death, the Prophet composed for them this
   song, even before the calamity occurred, that they might be better
   prepared for enduring it, and might hope for better things. I do not
   think that it was composed solely that, when they had been delivered,
   they might give thanks to God, but that even during their captivity,
   though they were like dead men, (Ezekiel 37:1,) they might strengthen
   their hearts with this confidence, and might also train up their
   children in this expectation, and hand down these promises, as it were,
   to posterity.

   We have formerly [154] seen the reason why these and other promises
   were put by Isaiah into the form of verse. It was, that, having been
   frequently sung, they might make a deeper impression on their memory.
   Though they mourned in Babylon, and were almost overwhelmed with
   sorrow, (hence these sounds, (Psalm 137:4,) "How can we sing the Lord's
   song in a foreign land?") yet they must have hoped that at a future
   period, when they should have returned to Judea, they would give thanks
   to the Lord and sing his praises; and therefore the Prophet shews to
   them at a distance the day of deliverance, that they may take courage
   from the expectation of it.

   We have a city of strength. By these words a full restoration of
   Jerusalem and of the people is promised, because God will not only
   deliver the captives and gather those that are scattered, but will also
   preserve them safe, after having brought them back to their country.
   But not long afterwards believers saw that Jerusalem was destroyed, (2
   Kings 25:9,) and the Temple thrown down, (2 Chronicles 36:19,) and
   after their return nothing could meet their eye but hideous ruins; and
   all this Isaiah had previously foretold. It was therefore necessary
   that they should behold from the lofty watch-tower of faith this
   restoration of Jerusalem.

   He hath made salvation to be walls and a bulwark. He now defines what
   will be "the strength of the city;" for the "salvation" of God will
   supply the place of a "wall," towers, ditches, and mounds. As if he had
   said, "Let other cities rely on their fortifications, God alone will be
   to us instead of all bulwarks." Some allege that the words may be read,
   "He hath set a wall and bulwark for salvation;" and I do not set aside
   that rendering. But as a more valuable doctrine is contained in the
   Prophet's words, when nothing is supplied, it serves no good purpose to
   go far for a forced interpretation; especially since the true and
   natural interpretation readily presents itself to the mind, which is,
   that God's protection is more valuable than all ditches and walls. In
   like manner, it is also said in the psalm, "Thy mercy is better than
   life," (Psalm 63:3;) for as David there boasts of enjoying, under God's
   shadow, greater safety and freedom from care than if he had been
   fortified by every kind of earthly defense, so Isaiah here says, that
   there will be good reason for laying aside fear, when God shall have
   undertaken to guard his people. Now, since this promise extends to the
   whole course of redemption, we ought to believe that at the present day
   God is still the guardian of his Church, and therefore, that his power
   is of more avail than if it had been defended by every kind of military
   force. Accordingly, if we wish to dwell in safety, we must remain in
   the Church. Though we have no outward defences, yet let us learn to be
   satisfied with the Lord's protection, and with his sure salvation,
   which is better than all bulwarks.

   2. Open ye the gates. This "song" was undoubtedly despised by many,
   when it was published by Isaiah; for during his life, the inhabitants
   of Jerusalem were wicked and ungodly, and the number of good men was
   exceedingly small. But after his death, when they had been punished for
   their wickedness, it was in some measure perceived that this prediction
   had not been uttered in vain. So long as wicked men enjoy prosperity,
   they have no fear, and do not imagine that they can be brought low.
   Thus the Jews thought that they would never be driven out of Judea, and
   carried into captivity, and hoped that they would continue to dwell
   there. It was therefore necessary to take away from them every pretense
   for being haughty and insolent; and such is the import of the Prophet's
   words:

   And a righteous nation, which keepeth the truth, shall enter in. "The
   inhabitants of the restored city shall be unlike the former; for they
   will maintain righteousness and truth. But at that time this promise
   also might appear to have failed of its accomplishment; for when they
   had been driven out of the country and led into captivity, no
   consolation remained. Accordingly, when the Temple had been destroyed,
   the city sacked, and all order and government overthrown and destroyed,
   they might have objected, "Where are those gates' which he bids us
   open?' Where are the people who shall enter?'" Yet we see that these
   things were fulfilled, and that nothing was ever foretold which the
   Lord did not accomplish. We ought, therefore, to keep before our minds
   those ancient histories, that we may be fortified by their example,
   and, amidst the deepest adversity to which the Church is reduced, may
   hope that the Lord will yet raise her up again.

   When the Prophet calls the nation "righteous and truthful," he not
   only, as I mentioned a little before, describes the persons to whom
   this promise relates, but shews the fruit of the chastisement; for when
   its pollution shall have been washed away, the holiness and
   righteousness of the Church shall shine more brightly. At that time
   wicked men were the majority, good men were very few, and were
   overpowered by the multitude of those who were of an opposite
   character. It was therefore necessary that that multitude, which had no
   fear of God, and no religion, should be taken away, that God might
   gather his remnant. Thus, it was a compensation for the destruction,
   that Jerusalem, which had been polluted by the wickedness of her
   citizens, again was actually devoted to God; for it would not have been
   enough to regain prosperity, if newness of life had not shone forth in
   holiness and righteousness.

   Now, as the Prophet foretells the grace of God, so he also exhorts the
   redeemed people to maintain uprightness of life. In short, he threatens
   that these promises will be of no avail to hypocrites, and that the
   gates of the city will not be opened for them, but only for the
   righteous and holy. It is certain that the Church was always like a
   barn, (Matthew 3:12,) in which the chaff is mingled with the wheat, or
   rather, the wheat is overpowered by the chaff; but when the Jews had
   been brought back into their country, the Church was unquestionably
   purer than before. Those who returned must have been animated by a good
   disposition, to undertake a journey so long, and beset by so many
   annoyances, embarrassments, and dangers; and many others chose rather
   to remain in captivity than to return, thinking that to dwell in
   Babylon was a safer and more peaceful condition than to return to
   Judea. Such persons must have had a seed of piety, which led them to
   take possession of those promises which were granted to the fathers.
   Now, though the Church even at that time was stained by many
   imperfections, still this description was comparatively true; for a
   large portion of the filth had been swept away, and those who remained
   had profited in some degree under God's chastisements.

   A righteous nation, which keepeth the truth. Some distinguish these
   terms in this manner, "A nation righteous before God, and upright
   before men." But I take the meaning to be more simple; that, after
   having called the nation "righteous," he shews in what righteousness
   consists; that is, where there is uprightness of heart, which has
   nothing feigned or hypocritical, for nothing is more opposite to
   righteousness than hypocrisy. And though no man ever existed who
   advanced so far that he could receive the commendation of being
   perfectly righteous, yet the children of God, who with their whole
   heart aim at this "truth," may be said to be keepers of it. But perhaps
   it will rather be thought that, by a figure of speech, one part is
   taken for the whole, to describe what is true righteousness; that is,
   when all deceit and all wicked practices have been laid aside, and men
   act towards each other with sincerity and truth.

   If any man wish to make use of this passage for upholding the merits of
   men, the answer is easy; for the Prophet does not here describe the
   cause of salvation, or what men are by nature, but what God makes them
   by his grace, and what kind of persons he wishes to be members of his
   Church. Out of wolves he makes sheep, as we have formerly seen. [155]
   So long as we live here, we are always at a great distance from
   perfection, and are in continual progress towards it; but the Lord
   judges of us according to that which he has begun in us, and, having
   once led us into the way of righteousness, reckons us to be righteous.
   As soon as he begins to check and reform our hypocrisy, he at once
   calls us true and upright.

   3. The thought is fixed; thou wilt keep peace, peace. [156] As the
   Hebrew word ytsr (YEtzEr) signifies both "imagination" or "creature,"
   and "thought," some render it, "By a settled foundation thou wilt keep
   peace;" as if the Prophet meant, that when men, amidst the convulsions
   of the world, continue to rest firmly on God, they will always be safe.
   Others render it, "For the fixed thought thou wilt keep peace;" which
   amounts to nearly the same thing, that they who have fixed their minds
   on God alone will at length be happy; for in no other way does God
   promise that he will be the guardian of his people than when they rely
   on his grace with settled thoughts, and without change or wavering.
   Since, however, the sign of the dative case is not added, but the
   Prophet in a concise manner of expression says, "Fixed or steadfast
   thought," let my readers judge if it be not more appropriate to view it
   as referring to God, so as to make the meaning to be, that the peace of
   the Church is founded on his eternal and unchangeable purpose; for, in
   order to prevent godly minds from continual wavering, it is of the
   highest importance to look to the heavenly decree.

   It is undoubtedly true that we ought constantly to hope in God, that we
   may perceive his continual faithfulness in defending us; and believers
   are always enjoined not to be driven about by any doubt, or
   uncertainty, or wavering, but firmly to rely on God alone. Yet the
   meaning which is more easily obtained from this passage, and comes more
   naturally from the words of the Prophet, is, that it is a fixed and
   unchangeable decree of God, that all who hope in him shall enjoy
   eternal peace; for if fixed thought means the certainty and
   steadfastness of the godly, it would be superfluous to assign the
   reason, which is --

   Because he hath trusted in thee. In short, both modes of expression
   would have been harsh, that "continual peace is prepared for
   imagination," or "for thought." But it is perfectly appropriate to say
   that, when we trust in God, he never disappoints our hope, because he
   has determined to guard us for ever. Hence it follows, that, since the
   safety of the Church does not depend on the state of the world, it is
   not moved or shaken by the various changes which happen daily; but
   that, having been founded on the purpose of God, it stands with steady
   and unshakable firmness, so that it can never fall.

   There is also, I think, an implied contrast between God's fixed thought
   and our wandering imaginations; for at almost every moment there
   springs up something new which drives our thoughts hither and thither,
   and there is no change, however slight, that does not produce some
   doubt. We ought therefore to hold this principle, that we do wrong if
   we judge of God's unshaken purpose by our fickle imaginations; as we
   shall elsewhere see,

   "As far as the heavens are from the earth, so far are my thoughts from
   your thoughts, O house of Israel." (Isaiah 55:9.)

   We ought therefore above all to hold it certain, that our salvation is
   not liable to change; because the purpose of God is unchangeable.

   Thou wilt keep peace, peace. What has now been stated explains the
   reason of the repetition of the word peace; for it denotes
   uninterrupted continuance for ever. By the word peace I understand not
   only serenity of mind, but every kind of happiness; as if he had said,
   that the grace of God alone can enable us to live prosperously and
   happily.

   4. Trust ye in Jehovah for ever. As to the words, some read in the
   second clause, "Trust in God, the strong Jehovah of ages;" but as tsvr
   (tzur) is not always an adjective, but signifies strength, I reject
   that meaning as forced, besides that it has little relation to the
   subject, as will immediately appear. There is also little ground for
   the ingenuity of those who infer from this passage the divinity of
   Christ, as if the Prophet said, that "Jehovah is in Jah;" for the
   twofold name of God is given for the express purpose of magnifying his
   power.

   He now exhorts the people to rest safely on God, and therefore, after
   the preceding doctrine, there is now room for exhortation. Besides, it
   would have been vain to say that our peace is in the hand of God, and
   that he is our faithful guardian, if we had not been taught and
   instructed on this subject, and at the same time urged by exhortations.
   Yet he exhorts us not only to earnest hope, but to perseverance; and
   this discourse applies properly to believers, who have already learned
   what it is to trust in the Lord, and who need to be strengthened,
   because they are still weak, and may often fall, in consequence of the
   various motives to distrust with which they are called to struggle. He
   therefore does not enjoin them merely to trust in the Lord, but to
   remain steadfastly in trust and confidence to the end.

   For in Jah Jehovah is the strength of ages. [157] We ought to attend to
   the reason which is here assigned, namely, that as the power of God,
   which is the object of faith, is perpetual, so faith ought to be
   extended so as to be equally perpetual. When the Prophet speaks of the
   strength and power of God, he does not mean power which is unemployed,
   but power active and energetic, which is actually exerted on us, and
   which conducts to the end what he had begun. And this doctrine has a
   wider application, for it bids us truly believe that we ought to
   contemplate the nature of God; for, as soon as we turn aside from
   beholding it, nothing is seen but what is fleeting, and then we
   immediately faint. Thus ought faith to rise above the world by
   continual advances; for neither the truth, nor the justice, nor the
   goodness of God, is temporary and fading, but God continues always to
   be like himself.

   5. For he will bring down the inhabitants of loftiness. [158] He now
   explains more fully what is that power of God of which he spoke. It is
   that which we ourselves feel, and which is exerted for our benefit. The
   two clauses are therefore closely connected, that "the proud are laid
   low by the power of God," and that "the lowly and despised are placed
   in their room;" for it would not have yielded full consolation to tell
   us, in the first place, that "the proud will be laid low," if he had
   not likewise added, that "the lowly will be exalted," so as to hold
   dominion over the proud. We therefore acknowledge, that in our own
   experience God works powerfully for our salvation, and this yields to
   us a ground of hope.

   Under the word loftiness he includes not only bulwarks and
   fortifications of every kind, (for the ancients were wont to build
   their cities in lofty places,) but also wealth and magnificence. He
   therefore means, that no defense can prevent God from casting down the
   wicked, and laying them low. Towers and bulwarks, indeed, are not
   displeasing to God; but as it rarely happens that they who are strong
   and powerful are not proud, so loftiness frequently denotes pride.
   Unquestionably he speaks of the wicked, who have abundance of arms,
   forces, and money, and imagine that they are protected against God
   himself. He likewise comforts the Jews, as we have formerly said, [159]
   because the invincible power of Babylon might have terrified them and
   thrown them into despair, if the Lord had not supported them by this
   promise: "You have no reason for being terrified at the greatness or
   strength of Babylon; for she will quickly fall, and will not stand
   before the power of the Lord."

   7. Straightnesses are the way of the righteous man. He does not praise
   the righteousness of the godly, as some have falsely supposed, but
   shews that, through the blessing of God, they are prosperous and
   successful during the whole course of their life. Having only stated
   briefly in the beginning of the verse, that "their ways are plain and
   smooth," he explains more fully in the second clause, ascribing it to
   the grace of God that in an open plain, as it were, the righteous
   proceed in their course, till they reach the goal.

   Thou wilt weigh the straight path of the righteous. The word weigh
   contains a metaphor, that God, by applying a balance, as it were,
   brings to an equal measure those things which in themselves were
   unequal. The Hebrew word ysr (yashar) is ambiguous, for it may refer
   either to God or to the path. Accordingly some render it, Thou, who art
   upright, will direct the path of the righteous; [160] and in other
   passages God is called upright. (Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 25:8.) There
   would also be propriety in the allusion, that the straightness of which
   he spoke proceed from God, for he alone is straight or upright. But the
   other version appears to be more natural. [161]

   He promises in general, that God will take care of the righteous, so as
   to lead them, as it were, by his hand. When the wicked prosper and the
   righteous are oppressed, everything in this world appears to be moved
   by chance; and although Scripture frequently declares and affirms that
   God takes care of them, (Psalm 37:5; 1 Peter 5:7,) yet we can scarcely
   remain steadfast, but waver, when everything that happens to them is
   unfavourable. Yet it is true that the ways of the righteous are made
   plain by God's balance, however rough and uneven they may appear to be;
   and not only so, but he has committed them to the guardianship of his
   angels, "lest they should be injured, or dash their foot against a
   stone." (Psalm 91:11.) But for this, they would easily fall or give way
   through exhaustion, and would hardly ever make way amidst so many
   thorns and briers, steep roads, intricate windings, and rough places,
   did not the Lord lead out and deliver them.

   Let us therefore learn to commit ourselves to God, and to follow him as
   our leader, and we shall be guided in safety. Though snares and
   artifices, the stratagems of the devil and wicked men, and innumerable
   dangers, may surround us, we shall always be enabled to escape. We
   shall feel what the Prophet says here, that our ways, even amidst deep
   chasms, are made plain, so that there is no obstacle to hinder our
   progress. And, indeed, experience shews, that if we are not led by
   God's guidance, we shall not be able to push our way through rugged
   roads; for so great is our weakness that we shall scarcely advance a
   single step without stumbling at the smallest stone that comes in our
   way. Satan and wicked men not only entangle and delay us by many
   perplexities, and not only present to us slight difficulties, but cause
   us to encounter sometimes high mounds and sometimes deep pits, which
   even the whole world would be unable to avoid.

   It is therefore proper for us to acknowledge how much we need heavenly
   direction, and to confess with Jeremiah, "I know, O Lord, that the way
   of man is not in himself; and it is not in man that walketh to direct
   his steps." (Jeremiah 10:23.) Let us not be puffed up with vain
   confidence, as if the result were placed in our own power. Let us not
   boast, as James warns us, that "we shall do this or that." (James
   4:15.) Such is the manner of rash men, who act as if they could do
   everything at their own pleasure; while it is not in our power, as
   Solomon tells us, to direct our tongue so as to give a proper answer.
   (Proverbs 16:1.) In vain, therefore, do men form plans, and deliberate,
   and decide about their ways, if God do not stretch out his hand. But he
   holds it out to the righteous, and takes peculiar care of them; for,
   while the providence of God extends to all, and while he supplies the
   wants of young ravens (Psalm 147:9) and sparrows, (Matthew 10:29,) and
   of the smallest animals, yet he has a fatherly kindness towards the
   godly, and delivers them out of dangers and difficulties.

   8. Yea, in the way of thy judgments. This verse contains a very
   beautiful doctrine, without which it might have been thought that the
   former statements were without foundation. Since he said that God will
   be our guide during the whole of life, so that we shall neither wander
   nor stumble, and while, on the other hand, we are pressed by so many
   straits, we might conclude that those promises have not been actually
   fulfilled. Accordingly, when he tries our patience, we ought to strive,
   and yet to trust in him. Here the Prophet gives us this instruction,
   that, though our eyes are not gratified by an easy and delightful path,
   and though the road is not made smooth under our feet, but we must toil
   through many hard passages, still there is room for hope and patience.

   By the way of judgments he means adversity, and the word judgment often
   has this meaning in Scripture. But here is a mark which distinguishes
   the godly from hypocrites; for in prosperity hypocrites bless God, and
   speak highly of him; but in adversity they murmur, and curse God
   himself, and plainly shew that they had no confidence in him, and thus
   judge of God according as their prosperity lasts. The godly, on the
   other hand, when they are tried by afflictions and calamities, are more
   and more excited to place confidence. [162]

   The particle 'ph, (aph,) Even, is inserted for the sake of emphasis, as
   if the Prophet had said, that believers are earnest in the worship of
   God, not only so long as he treats them with gentleness, but that, if
   he deal harshly with them, still they do not faint, because they are
   supported by hope. It is therefore the true test of sincere godliness,
   when not only while God bestows his kindness upon us, but while he
   withdraws his face, and afflicts us, and gives every sign of severity
   and displeasure, we place our hope and confidence in him. Let us learn
   to apply this doctrine to our own use, whenever we are hard pressed by
   the calamities of the present life; and let us not cease to trust in
   him, even when our affairs are in the most desperate condition. [163]
   "Though He slay me," says Job, "I will trust in Him;" and David says
   that: "though he walk amidst the shadow of death, he will trust and not
   be afraid, because he knows that God is with him." (Job 13:15; Psalm
   23:4.)

   To thy name. The Prophet aims at shewing what is the source of that
   uwearied earnestness which prevents the godly from sinking under the
   greatest calamities. It is because they are free from wicked desires
   and from excessive solicitude, and in their aspirations boldly rise to
   God. For, in consequence of our disorderly passions and cares holding
   us bound, as it were, to the earth, our hearts either wander astray, or
   sink into indolence, so that they do not freely rise to God; and as the
   essence of God is hidden from us, this makes us more sluggish in
   seeking him. From his hidden and incomprehensible essence, therefore,
   the Prophet draws our attention to the name of God, as if he enjoined
   us to rest satisfied with that manifestation of it which is found in
   the word; because there God declares to us, as far as is necessary, his
   justice, wisdom, and goodness, that is, himself.

   And to the remembrance of thee. It is not without good reason also that
   he has added the word remembrance; for it means that the first
   perception or thought is not enough, but that continual meditation is
   enjoined; because without its aid all the light of doctrine would
   immediately vanish away. And indeed the true and sincere knowledge of
   God inflames us to desire him, and not only so, but also prompts us to
   desire to make progress, whenever the "remembrance" of it occurs to our
   minds. The knowledge of God, therefore, comes first; and next, we must
   be employed in frequent "remembrance;" for it is not enough that we
   have once obtained knowledge, if love and desire do not grow through
   constant meditation. Hence, also, we perceive that the knowledge of God
   is not a dead imagination.

   9. My soul hath desired thee. This is a stronger expression of the
   former statement; for, having previously spoken in the person of
   believers, he had said that the desire of their soul was towards God.
   He now adds, with regard to himself, My soul hath desired; as if he had
   said, "I have all the faculties of my soul directed towards seeking thy
   name." The word nphs (nephEsh) frequently denotes the vital Soul; but
   as the Prophet here employs two words, I distinguish them so as to make
   nphs (nephesh) mean the desire or will, and rvch (ruach) the
   intellectual parts; for we know that these are the chief parts of the
   human soul, namely, the Understanding and the Will, both of which God
   justly claims for himself. Such is also the import of that passage,
   "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy
   mind, and with all thy strength." (Deuteronomy 6:5; Matthew 22:37.) The
   Prophet therefore shews, that all the faculties of his soul are
   directed to this point, to seek God and embrace him.

   Others take rvch, (ruach,) the Spirit, to mean the regenerated part;
   and so by nphs (nEphEsh) they understand the natural soul, and by rvch,
   (ruach,) the Spirit, they understand the grace of God, which is
   supernatural. But this cannot be admitted; for the sensual man
   (psuchikos) never seeks God; and we perceive how strongly we are
   opposed by our feelings when we rise to God, and with what difficulty
   we conquer that aversion. It is unnecessary, therefore, to refute this
   interpretation, for it is directly contrary to Scripture; and from many
   similar passages it is sufficiently plain that the Spirit and Soul mean
   the understanding and the heart.

   In the night. By the night Scripture often means adversity, which is
   compared to darkness and gloominess. But I interpret it somewhat
   differently, as if the Prophet had said, "There is no time so improper
   or unreasonable that I may not call upon thee or pray to thee." That
   interpretation differs little from the former, but is rather more
   general; for night is supposed to be set apart for rest, and at that
   time all the desires and labors of men [164] cease; and, in short,
   there is little difference between a sleeping and a dead man. He says,
   therefore, that at the time which is devoted to rest and repose he
   rises to seek God, so that no occasion turns him aside; -- not that
   those who are asleep have any active thought, but that sleep itself, if
   we turn to God, is a part of our course; and although we slumber and
   are silent, still we praise him by hope and confidence.

   In the morning [165] will I seek thee. By the night the Prophet does
   not literally mean sleep; and this is perfectly evident from the
   present clause, in which night is contrasted with morning, which
   denotes continuance.

   The inhabitants of the earth will learn righteousness. We must observe
   the reason assigned, when he says that "the inhabitants of the earth
   learn righteousness from the judgments of God," meaning that by
   chastisements men are taught to fear God. [166] In prosperity they
   forget him, and their eyes are as it were blinded by fatness; they grow
   wanton and petulant, and do not submit to be under authority; and
   therefore the Lord restrains their insolence, and teaches them to obey.
   In short, the Prophet confesses that he and others were trained, by
   God's chastisements, to yield submission to his authority, and to
   intrust themselves to his guardianship; because if God do not, with
   uplifted arm, claim his right to rule, no man of his own accord yields
   obedience.

   10. The wicked man will obtain favour. [167] Isaiah contrasts this
   statement with the former. He had said that the godly, even when they
   are afflicted, or see others afflicted, still rely on the love of God,
   and trust in him. But now he declares, on the other hand, that the
   wicked cannot be brought in any way to love God, though he endeavor, by
   every sort of kindness, to draw and gain them over; and that, whatever
   aspect the Lord assume towards them, they do not become better.

   This verse appears, at first view, to contradict the former, in which
   the Prophet said, that the justice of God is acknowledged in the earth,
   when he executes his judgments, and shews that he is the Judge, and
   punishes the transgressions of men; while he says here that the wicked
   cannot in any way be led or persuaded to worship God, and that they are
   so far from being made better by the chastisements, that even acts of
   kindness make them worse. The good effect of chastisements certainly
   does not appear in all; for wicked men do not at all profit by them, as
   we see in Pharaoh, whom chastisements and scourges rendered more
   obstinate. (Exodus 7:13.) But although he spoke indiscriminately about
   "the inhabitants of the earth," yet he strictly included none but God's
   elect, with whom indeed even some hypocrites share the profit that is
   gained; for sometimes, though reluctantly, they are moved by reverence
   for God, and are restrained by the dread of punishments. [168] But as
   the Prophet here describes sincere repentance, by "the inhabitants of
   the earth" he means only the children of God.

   Some view it as a question, "Shall favor be shewn to the wicked?" or,
   "Why should the wicked man obtain favor?" as if the Prophet insinuated
   that they do not deserve that God should deal gently with them. But I
   choose rather to explain it thus, "Whatever may be the acts of kindness
   by which God draws the wicked, they will never learn to act uprightly."
   The Prophet therefore has limited the statement made in the former
   verse.

   In the land of upright actions he will deal unjustly. This is added in
   order to shew more strongly the baseness of this ingratitude. It was a
   sufficiently heinous offense that they abused the acts of God's
   kindness, and by means of them became more rebellious; but it is their
   crowning wickedness, that "they deal wickedly in the land" which the
   Lord had consecrated to himself. What he now says relates to Judea, but
   may be extended also to other countries in which God is now worshipped;
   but at that time there was no other country on which Isaiah could
   bestow that title, for in no other was there any knowledge of God.
   (Psalm 76:2.)

   Thus he calls Judea "the land of upright actions." I give this
   interpretation, because, since the Prophet employs nkchvt (nekOchOth)
   in the feminine gender, the word upright cannot apply to men. [169] He
   therefore bestows this title, because the law was there in full force,
   (Psalm 76:1, 2.) and that nation had been peculiarly chosen by God; and
   it was added, as I have already said, in order to exhibit more strongly
   the ingratitude of the nation. Some extend it indiscriminately to the
   whole world, because, wherever we live, God supports us on the
   condition of our maintaining uprightness. This is too far-fetched; but,
   since God has now spread abroad his kingdom in every direction,
   wheresoever men call on his name, that is "the land of upright
   actions;" [170] so that we are worthy of double condemnation, if, after
   having been stimulated by benefits so numerous and so great, we do not
   testify our gratitude by the practice of godliness and by good works.

   When he adds, that the reprobate will not behold the majesty of the
   Lord, this does not in any degree palliate, but rather doubles their
   criminality; because it is base and shameful indolence not to observe
   the glory of God which is openly manifested before our eyes. The wicked
   are thus rendered the more inexcusable, because, how numerous soever
   may be the methods by which the Lord makes known his name, still they
   are blind amidst the clearest light. There is never any lack of
   testimonies by which the Lord openly manifests his majesty and glory,
   but, as we have formerly seen, [171] few consider them. God manifests
   his glory not only by the ordinary works of nature, but likewise by
   some astonishing miracles and demonstrations, by means of which he
   gives us abundant instruction about his goodness, wisdom, and justice.
   Wicked men shut their eyes, and do not observe them, though in trifling
   matters they are very clear-sighted; and the Prophet now censures them
   severely for this wickedness.

   Others think that it is a threatening against the reprobate, they shall
   not behold the majesty of the Lord, as if they did not deserve to
   obtain this view of the works of God. Though this is true, yet, as this
   clause is closely connected with the former, the Prophet continues to
   censure the indolence of those who do not direct their minds to the
   works of God, but, on the contrary, become stupid. On this account, we
   ought to think it the less wonderful that so few repent, though very
   many demonstrations of the righteousness of God are openly made; for
   infidelity is always blind to behold the works of God.

   11. O Jehovah, though thy hand is lifted up. This is an explanation of
   the former statement; for he brings forward nothing that is new, but
   shews more clearly what he had formerly stated in a few words. He had
   already said that the wicked "will not behold the majesty of the Lord;"
   and now he explains that "majesty" to be that which is visible in the
   works of God. He does not send us to that hidden majesty which is
   concealed from us, but leads us to the works, which he denotes
   figuratively (metonumikos) [172] by the hand. Here he again censures
   the wicked, and shews that they cannot be excused on the plea of
   ignorance; for, though they perceive nothing, still the hand of God is
   openly visible; and it is nothing but their blind ingratitude, or
   rather their voluntary indolence, that hinders them from perceiving it.
   Some might plead ignorance, and allege that they did not see these
   works; but the Prophet says that God's hand is "lifted up," and not
   merely exerted, so that it is not only visible to a few persons, but
   shines conspicuously.

   They shall see and be ashamed. He shews plainly that this "beholding"
   is different from that of which he formerly spoke, when he said that
   the wicked "do not see the glory of the Lord;" for they do see, but do
   not observe or take any notice of it; but at length "they shall see,"
   but too late, and to their great hurt. After having long abused the
   patience of God, and proved that they were obstinate and rebellious,
   they will at length be constrained to acknowledge the judgments of God.
   Thus Cain, (Genesis 4:13,14,) Esau, (Genesis 27:38,) and others like
   them, who too late repented of their crimes, (Hebrews 12:17,) though
   they fled from the face of God, yet were constrained to see that he was
   their Judge. Thus, in those who despise him, God frequently produces a
   feeling of remorse, that he may display his power; but such knowledge
   is of no avail to them.

   In this manner, therefore, the Prophet threatens wicked men, after
   having accused them of blindness, in order to shew that they have no
   plea of ignorance; and he forewarns them that the time will come when
   they shall know with whom they have to do, and that they will then feel
   that they ought not to despise that heavenly name which they now treat
   as fabulous, and scorn. They shut their eyes, and act without
   restraint, and make us a laughing-stock, and do not think that God will
   be their Judge, but rather turn into ridicule our distresses and
   afflictions. Thus they look down on us as from a lofty place, and grow
   more and more hardened; but at length they will understand that the
   true worshippers of God have not lost their labor.

   And shall be ashamed. In order to shew that this beholding of the glory
   of God is not only of no advantage, but hurtful to them, he says that
   they shall behold with shame the blessing of God towards believers, in
   which they will have no share.

   Through their envy of the people. This tends to shew more strongly the
   severity of the punishment, that not only will they burn with "envy,"
   when they shall see that the children of God have been delivered from
   those distresses, and have been exalted to glory, but there will
   likewise be added another evil, that they will be consumed by the fire
   of the enemy. By "the envy of the people," therefore, is here meant the
   indignation which wicked men feel when they compare the lot of godly
   men with their own.

   Yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them. By the fire of the
   enemies, he means that "fire" with which God consumes his "enemies." He
   employs the word "fire" to denote God's vengeance; for here it must not
   be taken for visible "fire" with which we are burned, nor even for the
   thunderbolt alone, but is a metaphorical expression for dreadful
   anguish, as we find that in many other passages Scripture denotes by
   this term, God's severest vengeance. (Deuteronomy 32:22; Job 20:26,
   22:20.) No language indeed can sufficiently express this anguish. Yet I
   do not object to the suggestion, that the Prophet alludes to the
   destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. (Genesis 19:24.)

   12. O Jehovah, thou wilt ordain peace for us. This statement tends to
   the consolation of the godly, as if he had said, "We shall see what
   will be the end of the wicked; for thou wilt prevent them from sharing
   with thy children, and wilt take them away as enemies by fire, but we
   shall be happy." The Hebrew verb spht, (shaphath,) which signifies "to
   ordain," has the same import as the word "establish;" as if he had
   said, "Thou wilt prepare peace for us in uninterrupted succession:" for
   the wicked also enjoy peace, but not of long duration; but our peace is
   fixed on the Lord, and has a firm foundation, and never comes to an
   end. By the word peace he means perfect happiness. Hence infer, that
   the children of God alone, who rest on him, are happy; for the life of
   the wicked, to whatever extent it may abound in pleasures and luxuries,
   when everything proceeds to their wish, is most miserable. There is
   therefore no solid foundation for peace but in God's fatherly love.

   All our works. By works he means all the blessings which the Lord
   bestows on those who believe in him; as if he had said, "Transactions,
   business, actions," and everything included in the French phrase nos
   affaires, or in the corresponding English phrase our affairs.
   Accordingly, those who have quoted this passage for the purpose of
   overturning free-will have not understood the Prophet's meaning. It is
   undoubtedly true that God alone does what is good in us, and that all
   the good actions which men perform are from his Spirit. But here the
   Prophet merely shews that we have obtained from the hand of God all the
   good things which we enjoy; and hence he infers that his kindness will
   not cease till we shall have obtained perfect happiness. Now, since God
   is the author of all good things, we ought chiefly to consider those
   which hold the first and highest place; for if we ought to acknowledge
   that we have received from God those things by which we support this
   life, much more those which belong to the salvation of the soul. If,
   therefore, we ought to acknowledge his kindness in small matters, how
   much more ought we to acknowledge it in matters of the greatest
   importance and value? But there is no reason why we should bring
   forward this passage against the Papists; for they might easily evade
   it, and we have a great number of other passages exceedingly
   conclusive.

   In this passage, therefore, the Prophet appears to exhort the godly to
   testify their gratitude; for he bids them declare the acts of God's
   kindness, so as to acknowledge that they are indebted to him for
   everything which they possess; and this contains a profitable doctrine,
   namely, that from past events and benefits received, the godly reason
   even as to God's future kindness, and infer that he will also take care
   of them for the future. Having therefore experienced God's kindness,
   let us also learn to hope for the future; and since he hath shewn
   himself to be so kind and bountiful, let us steadfastly fix our hearts
   in the hope of future assistance.

   This example has been followed by all the saints, and in this way they
   have strengthened their faith. Thus David says, "Thou wilt not despise
   the work of thy hands." (Psalm 138:8.) Paul says, "He who hath begun in
   us a good work will perform it." (Philippians 1:6.) Jacob also says, "I
   am less than the compassions and the truth which thou hast shewn to thy
   servant; but thou saidst, I will surely do thee good." (Genesis
   32:10,12.) God is not like men, to be capable of being wearied by doing
   good, or exhausted by giving largely; and therefore the more numerous
   the benefits with which he has loaded us, so much the more ought our
   faith to be strengthened and increased.

   13. O Lord our God. This verse contains a complaint of the saints, that
   they were oppressed by the tyranny of the wicked. This song was
   composed in order to refresh the hearts of believers, who were to be
   cruelly banished from that land which was a figure of eternal
   happiness, that, having been deprived of sacrifices and holy
   assemblies, and almost of every consolation, crushed by the heavy yoke
   of the Babylonians, banished from their country, loaded with reproach
   and sore afflictions, they might direct their groanings to God, in
   order to seek relief. He speaks, therefore, in the name of believers,
   who to outward appearance had been rejected by God, and yet did not
   cease to testify that they were the people of God, and to put their
   trust in him.

   Other lords besides thee have had dominion over us. Not without cause
   do they complain that they are placed under a different dominion from
   that of God, for he had received them under his sole guardianship.
   Hence it follows that, if they had not been estranged from him, they
   would not have endured so hard a lot as to be exposed to the tyranny
   and caprice of enemies. It may be thought that the government of all
   princes is "besides God," or different from that of God, even though
   they govern in his name. But the Prophet does not speak of those who
   govern for our benefit, but of those who are opposed to true worship
   and to holy doctrine. David was indeed a ruler who exercised dominion
   separate from that of God, but at the same time he was a genuine
   servant of God for the general advantage of the whole people; and
   therefore he maintained the true religion, which those rulers wished
   altogether to overthrow. Most justly did it befall the Jews, that, in
   consequence of having refused to obey God, who treated them with the
   greatest kindness, they were subjected to the tyranny of wicked men.

   There is an implied contrast between God and the pious kings who
   governed the people in his name and by his authority, and the tyrants
   who oppressed them by governing with most unjust laws. This will be
   made more evident by a similar passage in Ezekiel, "I gave them," says
   God, "good laws, by which they might live; but because they did not
   execute my judgments, and despised my statutes, and profaned my
   Sabbaths, and cast their eyes upon the idols of their fathers, for this
   reason I gave them statutes that were not good, and judgments by which
   they could not live." (Ezekiel 20:11, 24, 25.) Since they might
   formerly, through the blessing of God, have been prosperous and happy,
   if they had obeyed his word, the prophet Ezekiel threatens that they
   will be subjected to tyrants who will compel them to obey their cruel
   enactments, and that without profit or reward. Isaiah now deplores a
   similar calamity. "When the Lord ruled over us, we could not be
   satisfied with our lot, and now we are compelled to endure severe
   tyranny, and suffer the just punishment of our wickedness." The same
   complaint may be made by believers who live under the Papacy, or who in
   any way are compelled, by unjust laws, to observe superstition; for
   they are subject to a government which is "besides God," or different
   from that of God, and endure bondage worse than barbarous, which not
   only fetters their bodies, but conducts their souls to torture and
   slaughter.

   In thee only. This clause appears to be contrasted with the former to
   this effect, "Although irreligious men wish to withdraw from thy
   dominion, yet we will continue under it; for we are fully convinced
   that we are thine." But we may draw from it more abundant instruction,
   that, although the feeling of the flesh pronounces that those who are
   cruelly oppressed by enemies have been forsaken by God, and laid open
   to be a prey, yet the Jews do not cease to boast in God when they do
   not perceive that he is near them; for the mere remembrance of his name
   supports them, and gently cherishes their hope. There is thus a very
   emphatic contrast between "the remembrance of the name of God" and the
   immediate experience of his grace; for steadfastly to embrace God, even
   though he is absent, is a proof of uncommon excellence.

   Others render it, In thee and in thy name; but the word and is not in
   the passage. There is here exhibited to us consolation, which is great
   and highly necessary in these times, when the base ingratitude of men,
   by shaking off the yoke of God, has brought down upon itself a most
   cruel tyranny; and we need not wonder if we already see it abound in
   many places in which men call on the name of God. Yet the godly ought
   not to faint on this account, provided that they support themselves by
   this consolation, that God never entirely forsakes those who find
   abundant consolation in the remembrance of his name. But at the same
   time it is necessary to testify this faith, so as to choose to die a
   thousand times rather than depart from God by profaning his name; for
   when any one goes astray through the fear of men, it is certain that he
   never has truly tasted the sweetness of the name of God. So long,
   therefore, as we freely enjoy the word, let us be diligently employed
   in it, so that, when necessity shall demand it, we may be armed, and
   that it may not appear that we have indulged at our ease in idle
   speculation.

   14. The dead shall not live. [173] The Prophet again speaks of the
   unhappy end of the wicked, whose prosperity often agitates and vexes
   us, as we read in the Psalms of David. (Psalm 37:1, 73:3, 17.) That our
   eyes may not be dazzled by the present appearances of things, he
   foretells that their end will be very miserable. Others interpret this
   passage as relating to believers, who appear to die without any hope of
   a resurrection; but unquestionably he speaks of the reprobate, and this
   will be still more evident from an opposite statement which he makes at
   the nineteenth verse. There is a contrast between the resurrection of
   good men and wicked men, [174] between whom there would be little
   difference, were it not evident that the latter are sentenced to
   eternal death, and that the former will receive a blessed and
   everlasting life: and not only does eternal death await the wicked, but
   all the sufferings which they endure in this world are the commencement
   of everlasting destruction; for they cannot be soothed by any
   consolation, and they feel that God is their enemy.

   The slain shall not rise again. [175] The word which we render slain is
   rendered by others giants; [176] but as in many passages of Scripture
   rph'ym [177] (rEphaim) denotes slain, so also in this passage it will
   be more appropriate, for otherwise there would be no contrast. (Psalm
   88:11; Proverbs 2:18; 9:18; 21:16.)

   Therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them. This is added for the
   sake of explanation; for it assigns the reason why the reprobate perish
   without hope, namely, because it is the purpose of God to destroy them.
   In the wrath of God they have nothing to look for but death and ruin.

   15. Thou hast added to the nation. This verse is explained in various
   ways. Some think that the Prophet here declares that the godly are not
   merely oppressed by one kind of affliction, but are plunged, as it
   were, into the lowest misery, and that they see no end of their
   distresses. Others explain it simply to mean, "O Lord, thou hast
   bestowed on thy nation various blessings," and think that the Prophet
   mentions the blessings which God bestowed on his people in various
   ways, as if he had said, "The people have experienced, not only in one
   instance, but in innumerable ways, the Lord's kindness and bounty."

   But when I attend to what follows, Thou hast enlarged, that is, "Thou
   hast extended thy kingdom, which formerly was confined within narrow
   limits," I choose rather to view the two statements as closely
   connected; for the latter clause is an interpretation of the former.
   Besides, it agrees well with what follows, that God is glorified; for
   we know that in nothing does the glory of God shine more conspicuously
   than in the increase of the Church. It is as if he had said, "Thou
   hadst formerly a small people, but thou hast multiplied and increased
   it;" for the Gentiles were admitted and joined to the Jews on condition
   that they should be united into one people. Thus the Lord added a vast
   multitude, for the children of Abraham were called out of all nations.

   We must therefore supply, not "Thou hast added blessings," but "Thou
   hast added a greater number;" and the meaning is, "O Lord, thou wast
   not satisfied with that small number, and hast gathered for thyself out
   of all nations an innumerable people." This relates to the kingdom of
   Christ, which has been spread through the whole world by the preaching
   of the gospel; and in this passage the Prophet speaks highly of this
   wide extension, and expresses it by the phrase, Thou hast enlarged.
   This mode of expression is not at variance with the ordinary way of
   speaking, when an enlargement of a kingdom or of territories is
   expressed. And yet the Prophet does not mean that the land was
   enlarged, but that, by spreading the worship of God on all sides,
   mutual intercourse produced larger space and greater freedom of
   habitation; for contentions had the effect of narrowing it. [178] We
   have here a promise of the calling of the Gentiles, which must have
   greatly comforted godly men during that banishment and miserable
   dispersion of the Church, so that, although they saw it to be amazingly
   weakened and diminished, still they were convinced that it would be
   increased in such a manner that not only would they become innumerable,
   but foreign and distant nations would be added to them.

   16. O Jehovah, in tribulation they have visited thee. This might be
   explained as relating to hypocrites, who never flee to God but when
   they have been constrained by distresses and afflictions. But since the
   Lord instructs believers also by chastisements, as the Prophet formerly
   shewed, (verses 8 and 9,) I choose rather to refer it simply to them,
   that not only they may know that God has justly punished them, but that
   the bitterness of the afflictions may likewise be sweetened by the good
   result of the chastisement, and that they may be better instructed in
   the fear of the Lord, and may profit more and more every day. Isaiah
   therefore speaks in the person of the Church, that whenever godly men
   read this statement, they might acknowledge that amidst their
   distresses and afflictions they were nearer to God than when they
   enjoyed prosperity, by means of which almost always (such is the
   depravity of our nature) we become excessively proud and insolent. On
   this account we must be curbed and tamed by chastisements; and this
   thought will soften the harshness of punishments, and make us less
   ready to shrink from them if we think that they are profitable to us.

   They poured out a prayer. The Hebrew word lchs (lachash) [179]
   signifies a muttering. This word therefore must not be taken for a
   prayer pronounced in words, [180] but for that which indicates that the
   heart is wrung with sore pains, as those who are tortured by extreme
   anguish can hardly speak or express the feelings of their hearts. It
   therefore denotes, that calling upon God which is sincere and free from
   all hypocrisy; such as men will aim at when in sore affliction they
   utter groans as expressive of intense pain. In prosperity men speak
   with open mouths; but when they are cast down by adversity, they hardly
   venture to mutter, and express their feelings with the heart rather
   than with the tongue. Hence arise those unutterable groans of which
   Paul speaks. (Romans 8:26.) It is in reference to the godly, therefore,
   that Paul makes this declaration, and to them must this doctrine be
   limited; for wicked men, although some lamentations are extorted from
   them by pain, become more hardened and more and more obstinate and
   rebellious.

   17. As a woman with child. Here two things ought chiefly to be
   remarked. First, he compares believers to women in labor, who, we know,
   endure exquisite pain; and, accordingly, he says that their anguish
   breaks out into loud and violent cries. Hence we infer that the Prophet
   does not only speak of that sorrow which arises from outward distresses
   and annoyances, but rather describes that dreadful anguish by which the
   hearts of the godly are sorely and dreadfully tormented, when they
   perceive that God is angry with them, and when their consciences
   reprove them. There is no bodily pain so acute that it can be compared
   to that anguish, and this is plainly expressed by the phrase in thy
   sight

   18. We have as it were brought forth wind. The second thing to be
   remarked is, that he goes beyond the limit of the metaphor; for when
   there is no end to their distresses, the condition of the godly is
   worse than that of women in labor, who, as soon as they are free from
   their pains, break out into joy at the sight of what they have brought
   forth, (John 16:21,) and forget all their sorrows. The godly, on the
   other hand, he tells us, are continually bringing forth; for new
   troubles and anxieties constantly await them, and when they think that
   the birth is at hand, they bring forth nothing but anguish. That is
   what he means by wind, [181] namely, that there is no removal or
   abatement of pain; and immediately afterwards he thus explains it,
   Salvations have not been wrought for the land, [182] that is, we have
   not beheld any deliverance.

   And the inhabitants of the world have not fallen. yphlv vvl (ubal
   yIppElu,) that is, have not fallen; for nphl (naphal) signifies "to
   fall." Others explain it "to dwell." If we take it in that sense, the
   meaning will be, "The Jews shall not dwell," that is, they shall not
   return to their own land; the inhabitants who possess it shall not
   perish. But if we follow the ordinary interpretation, we must view it
   as referring to the wicked. "The inhabitants of the world annoy us and
   do not fall; everything goes on prosperously with them."

   So long as the wicked flourish, the children of God must be unhappy,
   and become like women in labor; and this condition must be quietly
   endured by us, if we wish to have a place in the Church of God. It is,
   indeed, the common lot of all to endure numerous and endless
   afflictions; and hence comes the old proverb, "It is happy not to be
   born, or, when born, immediately to depart out of life." But we see
   that the godly are visited with sore anguish and very heavy afflictions
   beyond others; for in this manner God wishes to try their faith, that,
   after having laid aside their desires and forsaken the world, they may
   serve him. Since, therefore, the Lord has a peculiar care of them, he
   must chastise them, while he permits wicked men to indulge in unbounded
   licentiousness.

   Here we are also reminded that we must endure not merely one or another
   calamity, and must not imagine that, when we have endured some
   afflictions, there are none in reserve for us; for we ought always to
   be prepared to endure new ones. When God begins to chastise his people,
   he does not immediately cease. We shall "bring forth wind" when we
   think that the birth is at hand; other calamities will break out, and
   we shall be continually attacked by additional sorrows. We must
   therefore maintain this warfare so long as it shall please God to
   employ us in it. Accordingly, we shall follow the ordinary
   interpretation, have not fallen; for, as the Lord cheers his people,
   when he manifests to them his salvation and punishes the wicked, so he
   gives them occasion to groan, so long as they behold their enemies
   placed in a lofty position and exercising high authority. And if the
   Lord in this manner tried his Church in former times, we need not
   wonder that we experience the same thing in the present day.

   By the inhabitants of the world he means heathens and irreligious men;
   for he contrasts the rest of the world with Judea, which he formerly
   called, by way of eminence, (kat ' exochen,) the land, and mentions its
   inhabitants apart.

   19. Thy dead men shall live. Isaiah continues the same consolation, and
   addresses his discourse to God, thus shewing that there is nothing
   better for us than to bring our thoughts to meet in God, whenever we
   must struggle with temptations; for there is nothing more dangerous
   than to wander in our thoughts, and to give way to them, since they can
   do nothing else than toss us up and down and drive us into error.
   Nothing therefore is safer for us than to betake ourselves to God, on
   whom alone our hearts can rest; for otherwise we shall meet with many
   things that tend to shake our faith. The general meaning is, that as
   God guards believers, though they are like "dead men," yet they "shall
   live" amidst death itself, or shall rise again after their decease.

   But it may be asked, of what time does Isaiah speak? For many interpret
   this passage as relating to the last resurrection. The Jews refer it to
   Messiah's kingdom, but they are mistaken in thinking that it is
   immediately fulfilled by the Messiah's first coming. Christians are
   also mistaken in limiting it to the last judgment; for the Prophet
   includes the whole reign of Christ from the beginning to the end, since
   the hope of living, as we shall immediately see, goes beyond this
   world. Now, in order to understand more fully the whole of the
   Prophet's meaning, we ought first to consider that life is promised,
   not indiscriminately, but only to "God's dead men;" and he speaks of
   believers who die in the Lord, and whom he protects by his power. We
   know that "God is the God of the living, and not of the dead." (Matthew
   22:32.) Accordingly, if we are God's people, we shall undoubtedly live;
   but in the meantime we must differ in no respect from dead men, for
   "our life is hidden," (Colossians 3:3,) and we do not yet see those
   things for which we hope. (Romans 8:23, 24.)

   So then he speaks simply of the dead, that is, of the condition of
   believers, who lie in the shadow of death on account of various
   afflictions which they must continually endure. Hence it is evident,
   that this must not be limited to the last resurrection; for, on the
   contrary, we say that the reprobate, even while they live, are dead,
   because they do not taste God's fatherly kindness, in which life
   consists, and therefore perish in their brutal stupidity. But
   believers, by fleeing to God, obtain life in the midst of afflictions,
   and even in death itself; but because they have in prospect that day of
   the resurrection, they are not said literally to live till that day
   when they shall be free from all pain and corruption, and shall obtain
   perfect life; and, indeed, Paul justly argues, that it would be a
   subversion of order, were they to enjoy life till the appearance of
   Christ, who is the source of their life. (Colossians 3:3, 4.)

   Thus we have said that Isaiah includes the whole reign of Christ; for,
   although we begin to receive the fruit of this consolation when we are
   admitted into the Church, yet we shall not enjoy it fully till that
   last day of the resurrection is come, when all things shall be most
   completely restored; and on this account also it is called "the day of
   restitution." (Acts 3:21.) The only remedy for soothing the grief of
   the godly is, to cast their eyes on the result, by which God
   distinguishes them from the reprobate. As death naturally destroys all
   the children of Adam, so all the miseries to which they are liable are
   forerunners of death, and therefore their life is nothing else than
   mortality. But because the curse of God, through the kindness of
   Christ, is abolished, both in the beginning and in the end of death,
   all who are engrafted into Christ are justly said to live in dying; for
   to them all that is evil is the instrument of good. (Romans 8:28.)
   Hence it follows, that out of the depths of death they always come
   forth conquerors till they are perfectly united to their Head; and
   therefore, in order that we may be reckoned among "God's dead men,"
   whose life he faithfully guards, we must rise above nature. This is
   more fully expressed by the word nvlh, (nEbelah,) or dead body

   My dead body, they shall arise. As if he had said, "The long-continued
   putrefaction, by which they appear to be consumed, will not hinder the
   power of God from causing them to rise again entire." So far as relates
   to the phrase, some render it, "With my dead body." Others explain it,
   "Who are my dead body." Others supply the particle of comparison, "Like
   as my dead body;" but as the meaning is most fully brought out if,
   without adding or changing anything, we take up simply what the words
   mean, I choose to view them as standing in immediate connection. At
   least, this word is inserted for the express purpose that the Prophet
   may join himself to the whole Church, and thus may reckon himself in
   the number of "God's dead men" in the hope of the resurrection. [183]

   As to his mentioning himself in particular, he does so for the sake of
   more fully confirming this doctrine; for thus he testifies his
   sincerity, and shews that this confession is the result of faith,
   according to that saying, "I believed, therefore I spake." (Psalm
   116:10; 2 Corinthians 4:13.) But for this, irreligious men might
   discourse concerning the mercy of God and eternal life, though they had
   no sincere belief of them; for even Balaam knew that he spoke what was
   true, and yet he derived no benefit from his predictions. (Numbers
   23:19; 24:13.) Very differently does the Prophet speak in this passage;
   for he professes to belong to the number of those who shall obtain
   life, and then declares that he willingly endures all the troubles and
   calamities by which the Lord humbles and slays him, and that he chooses
   rather to endure them than to flourish along with the wicked. In this
   manner he testifies, that he does not speak of things unknown, or in
   which he has no concern, but of those things which he has learned by
   actual experience; and shews that his confidence is so great that he
   willingly ranks himself in the number of those "dead bodies" which, he
   firmly believes, will be restored to life, and therefore chooses to be
   a dead body, and to be so reckoned, provided that he be accounted a
   member of the Church, rather than to enjoy life in a state of
   separation from the Church.

   This gives greater force to his doctrine, and he contrasts it with the
   statement which he formerly made ([21]verse 14) about wicked men, they
   shall not live; for the hope of rising again is taken from them. If it
   be objected, that resurrection will be common not only to believers but
   also to the reprobate, the answer is easy; for Isaiah does not speak
   merely of the resurrection, but of the happiness which believers will
   enjoy. Wicked men will indeed rise again, but it will be to eternal
   destruction; and therefore the resurrection will bring ruin to them,
   while it will bring salvation and glory to believers.

   Awake and sing, ye inhabitants of the dust. He gives the name,
   inhabitants of the dust, to believers, who are humbled under the cross
   and afflictions, and who even during their life keep death constantly
   before their eyes. It is true that they enjoy God's blessings in this
   life; [184] but by this metaphor Isaiah declares that their condition
   is miserable, because they bear the image of death; for "the outward
   man" must be subdued and weakened, till it utterly decay, "that the
   inward man may be renewed." (2 Corinthians 4:16.) We must therefore be
   willing to be humbled, and to lie down in the dust, if we wish to share
   in this consolation.

   Accordingly, he bids the dead men "awake and sing," which appears to be
   very inconsistent with their condition; for among them there is nothing
   but mournful silence. (Psalm 6:5; 88:11.) He thus draws a clear
   distinction between God's elect, whom the corruption of the grave and
   the "habitation in the dust" will not deprive of that heavenly vigor by
   which they shall rise again, and the reprobate, who, separated from God
   the source of life, and from Christ, fade away even while they live,
   till they are wholly swallowed up by death.

   For thy dew is the dew of herbs. [185] He now promises "the dew of
   herbs," and thus illustrates this doctrine by an elegant and
   appropriate comparison. We know that herbs, and especially those of the
   meadows, are dried up in winter, so that they appear to be wholly dead,
   and, to outward appearance, no other judgment could be formed
   respecting them; yet the roots are concealed beneath, which, when they
   have imbibed the dew at the return of spring, put forth their vigor, so
   that herbs which formerly were dry and withered, grow green again. In
   this manner will the nation regain its former vigor after having been
   plentifully watered with the dew of the grace of God, though formerly
   it appeared to be altogether withered and decayed.

   Such comparisons, drawn from well-known objects, have great influence
   in producing conviction. If "herbs" watered by "dew" revive, why shall
   not we also revive when watered by the grace of God? Why shall not our
   bodies, though dead and rotten, revive? Does not God take more care of
   us than of herbs? And is not the power of the Spirit greater than that
   of "dew?" Paul employs a similar argument in writing to the
   Corinthians, when he treats of the resurrection; but as he applies his
   comparison to a different purpose, I think it better to leave it for
   the present, lest we should confound the two passages. It is enough if
   we understand the plain meaning of the Prophet.

   And the earth shall cast out the dead. Others render the clause in the
   second person, "Thou wilt lay low the land of giants," [186] or "Thou
   wilt lay low the giants on the earth." I do not disapprove of this
   interpretation, for the words admit of that meaning; but the former
   appears to agree better with the scope of the passage, though it makes
   little difference as to the substance of the doctrine. These words must
   relate to that consolation of which we have formerly spoken.

   20. Come, my people. In this verse he exhorts the children of God to
   exercise patience, to shut themselves up, and to bear with moderation
   their troubles and afflictions, and to stand unmoved in opposition to
   the fierce tempests which seemed likely to overwhelm them. This
   exhortation was highly necessary; for the lamentable state to which the
   nation was afterwards reduced was, to outward appearance, very
   inconsistent with that promise. The Prophet, therefore, when the people
   are distressed and know not where to go, takes them, as it were, by the
   hand, and conducts them to some retired spot, where they may hide
   themselves in safety till the storms and tempests are abated. When he
   calls them "his own people," he speaks in the name of God, and not in
   his own.

   Enter into thy chamber. By chamber he means calmness and composure of
   mind, by which we encourage and strengthen our hearts with firm belief,
   and calmly wait for the Lord, as Habakkuk, after having foretold the
   calamities which were about to fall on the Jews, says that he will go
   up "to his watch-tower," that is, to a place of safety, in which he may
   patiently and silently await the result. (Habakkuk 2:1.) Isaiah gives a
   similar injunction in this passage, that the godly, when they see that
   they are attacked by various storms which they are unable to resist,
   should shut themselves up in a "chamber," or some place of retirement.

   Shut thy doors behind thee. As it would not be enough that we should
   once be fortified against the fierce attacks of tempests, he bids us
   also "shut the doors." This relates to steadfastness; as if he enjoined
   us to take good heed not to leave any chink open for the devil; for he
   will easily break through and penetrate into our hearts, if the
   smallest entrance be allowed him.

   Hide thyself for a little moment. When he bids them "hide" or "conceal"
   themselves, he means that it will be a very safe refuge for believers,
   if they are courageous and patiently wait for the Lord; for though we
   must boldly and valiantly maintain the contest, yet since the power of
   God is displayed in our weakness, (2 Corinthians 12:9,) there is
   nothing better for us than to take refuge, with all humility, under
   God's wings, that they who tremble may be placed by him in perfect
   safety.

   Again, because we are naturally rash, and hurried away by impatience,
   when we do not see that the Lord's assistance is immediate, on this
   account he says that these storms are "momentary." [187] True, we must
   continually struggle with afflictions, and, so long as we live, must
   not hope to see an end of them; and, consequently, the afflictions are,
   in our opinion, of very long duration. But if we compare them with that
   eternity, in which we shall possess immortal joys, it will be but "a
   very little moment." In like manner, Paul also shews that the light and
   momentary afflictions which we endure in this life, ought not to be
   compared to that weight of eternal glory which we expect to receive. (2
   Corinthians 4:17; Romans 8:18.)

   Till the indignation pass over. By adding this he intends to remove all
   doubt from believers, as if he promised that they would quickly be
   delivered. I interpret "indignation" as meaning simply the affliction
   which proceeds from the Lord's anger. Others refer it to enemies; and I
   do not object to that interpretation, but prefer the former; for we see
   that the prophets earnestly teach that no evil happens to us that does
   not come from the hand of God, who does not inflict them on us without
   good reason, but when he has been provoked by our iniquities and
   transgressions. (Amos 3:6.) We are thus reminded that God's wrath
   against the Church will not last always, but that, like storms and
   tempests, it will come to an end, and on this account believers endure
   it more patiently. Hence it is said elsewhere, (Micah 7:9,) "I will
   bear the Lord's wrath;" for they know that he chastises them for their
   salvation. He introduces the Lord speaking, as I mentioned a little
   before, that his exhortation may have greater authority.

   21. For, behold, Jehovah cometh out of his place. It is a very grievous
   temptation to the godly, when they see that the wicked exercise their
   rage without being punished, and that God does not restrain them; for
   they look upon themselves as forsaken by him. Isaiah therefore meets
   this temptation, and shews that the Lord, though he keep himself out of
   view for a time, will in due season gird himself for yielding
   assistance, and for revenging the injuries which his people have
   received.

   By the word cometh out, he describes God stretching out his hand to his
   people in such a manner as if it had formerly been concealed, because
   the saints did not perceive his aid. For this reason he says, that the
   Lord "cometh out," and that he appears in public to yield assistance
   and exercise judgment, as if he had formerly dwelt like a private
   person at home. But perhaps there is an allusion to the sanctuary; and
   this mode of expression occurs frequently in the prophets. (Micah 1:3;
   Habakkuk 3:13; Zechariah 14:3.) Though heathen nations despised the ark
   of the covenant which was laid up in a place little renowned, yet
   believers knew, by communications of power and grace which they quickly
   obtained, that it was not in vain or to no purpose that they called on
   God in that holy place. Yet this principle always holds good, that,
   though unbelievers ridicule the temple as some mean hut, still God will
   "come forth" from it at his own time, that the whole world may know
   that he is the protector of his people

   This meaning is more appropriate than if we were to interpret God's
   place to mean heaven, from which he "cometh forth;" for Isaiah intended
   to express something more. When the prophets mention heaven, they
   exhibit to us the majesty and glory of God; but here he refers to our
   senses, that is, when we see that God, who formerly appeared to remain
   concealed and to be at rest, gives us assistance. He employs the
   demonstrative particle hnh, (hinneh,) behold, and the participle of the
   present tense yts', (yOtze,) coming forth, in order to express
   certainty, and that believers may not be displeased at bridling their
   feelings till his coming.

   To visit the iniquity. This is to the same purport with what goes
   before; for it would have been inconsistent with the nature of God, who
   is the judge of the world, to allow the wicked freely to indulge in sin
   without being punished. The word visit contains a well-known metaphor;
   because, so long as God delays or suspends his judgments, we think that
   he sees nothing, or that he has turned away his eyes. There is
   emphasis, also, in the phrase lyv, (gnalaiv,) upon him; as it is
   frequently said that the wicked are taken in "the snares which they
   have laid," (Psalm 9:16,) or "in the pit which they have digged."
   (Psalm 57:6.) The meaning therefore is, that all the injuries inflicted
   will fall on the heads of those who were the authors of them.

   The earth also shall disclose her blood. [188] This also is highly
   emphatic. When innocent blood is shed and trodden under foot by wicked
   men, the earth drinks it up, and as it were receives it into her bosom;
   and, in the meantime, the death of the godly appears to be forgotten,
   and to be blotted out for ever from remembrance, so that it shall never
   come to be beheld even by God himself. Men indeed think so, but God
   makes a widely different declaration; for he declares, that those
   murderers will one day be "disclosed" and brought into judgment.

   On this account he calls it "the blood, or bloods, of the earth," which
   the earth has drunk up; and in like manner it is said, that "the earth
   opened her mouth" when the blood of Abel was shed. (Genesis 4:11.) In
   that passage the Lord represents in strong terms the aggravation of
   that guilt, by saying, that the earth was polluted with that blood, and
   therefore he shews how "precious in his sight is the death of the
   saints," (Psalm 116:15,) how great is the care which he takes of them,
   and that at length he will not permit their death to pass unpunished.
   The earth itself will take up arms to avenge the murders and cruelties
   which the godly have endured from tyrants and enemies of the truth; and
   not a drop of blood has been shed of which they will not have to render
   an account. We ought therefore to call to remembrance this consolation,
   and to keep it constantly before our eyes, when the wicked slay, mock,
   and ridicule us, and inflict upon us every kind of outrage and cruelty.
   God will at length make known that the cry of innocent blood has not
   been uttered in vain; for he never can forget his own people. (Luke
   18:7.)

   dew of day-light is thy dew," and remarks: -- "A dew of rays, that is,
   as I conceive, a dew able to abide the solar rays, or a steady dew, in
   oppostion to the early dew that passeth away' of Hosea 6:4, 13:3; which
   the Prophet there parallels with the morning cloud.' The comparison of
   Isaiah intimates that the refreshing of Israel should not be transient,
   but lasting." Professor Alexander, with his usual learning and
   judgment, produces a formidable array of conflicting authorities, but
   vindicates the usual rendering. "There are," he says, "two
   interpretations of 'rvt, (OrOth,) both ancient, and supported by high
   modern authorities. The first gives the word the usual sense of 'yr,
   (Or,) light; the other, that of plants, which it has in 2 Kings 4:39.
   To the former it may be objected, that it leaves the plural form
   unexplained, that it arbitrarily makes light mean life, and that it
   departs from the acknowledged meaning of 'rvt (OrOth) in the only other
   place where it occurs. The second interpretation, on the other hand,
   assumes but one sense of the word, allows the plural form its proper
   force, and supposes an obvious and natural allusion to the influence of
   dew upon the growth of plants. In either case, the reference to the dew
   is intended to illustrate the vivifying power of God." -- Ed ^FT443 As
   to the interpretation of rph'ym (rEphaim) by giants, See [27]page 231,
   note 3 ^FT444 "Que ces tourbillons et orages passent, et sont de petite
   duree;" -- "That these whirlwinds and storms pass away, and are of
   short duration." ^FT445 "Her blood (Heb. bloods)." -- Eng. Ver.

   CHAPTER 27
     __________________________________________________________________

   Isaiah 27:1-13

   1. In that day the Lord, with his sore, and great, and strong sword,
   shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that
   crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.

   1. In die illa visitabit Iehova gladio suo duro, et magno et forti,
   super Leviathan serpentem penetrem, et super Leviathan serpentem
   flexuosum, et occidet draconem qui est in mari.

   2. In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.

   2. In die illa vineæ ruboris canite.

   3. I the Lord do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any hurt
   it, I will keep it night and day.

   3. Ego Iehova custodio eam, singulis momentis irragabo eam; ne visitet
   eam (hostis,) noctu et interdiu custodiam ipsam.

   4. Fury is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against me in
   battle? I would go through them, I would burn them together.

   4. Furor non est mihi. Quis me committat cum vepre et spina (aut,
   veprem spinoe)? Gradiar hostiliter per eam, incendam penitus.

   5. Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me;
   and he shall make peace with me.

   5. An apprehendet robur meum, ut faciat mecum pacem, mecum, inquam,
   pacem faciat?

   6. He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel shall
   blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.

   6. In posterum radices mittet Iacob; pullulabit et florebit Israel, et
   implebuntur facies orbis fructu.

   7. Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? or is he
   slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him?

   7. An juxta plagam percutientis eum percussit eum? An juxta cædem
   cædentium eum cæsus est.

   8. In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it: he
   stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.

   8. In mensura in emissione ejus disceptabis cum ea, etiam cum flaverit
   vento suo violento in die Euri.

   9. By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is
   all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all the stones of
   the alter as chalk-stones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and
   images shall not stand up.

   9. Itaque hoc modo expiabitur iniquitas Iacob; et hic omnis fructos,
   ablatio peccati ejus; cum posuerit cunctos lapides altaris sicut
   lapides calcis confractos, ut non resurgant luci et imagines.

   10. Yet the defenced city shall be desolate, and the habitation
   forsaken, and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and
   there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof.

   10. Civitas tamen munita erit solitaria; locus habitatus erit desertus,
   ac derelictus quasi solitudo. Ibi pascetur vitulus, et ibi accubabit et
   absumet summitates ejus.

   11. When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off: the
   women come, and set them on fire; for it is a people of no
   understanding: therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them,
   and he that formed them will shew them no favour.

   11. Dum arescet messis ejus, frangent (vel, secabunt) eam, mulieres
   venientes accendent eam; quia non est populus intelligens; propterea
   non miserebitur ejus factor ejus, et fictor ejus non erit illi
   propitius.

   12. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall beat off
   from the channel of the river unto the stream of Egypt, and ye shall be
   gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel.

   12. Accidet tamen in die illa, ut excutiat Iehova ab alveo fluminis ad
   fluvium Ægypti; et vos congregabimini unus ad unum, filii Israel.

   13. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet shall
   be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of
   Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the
   Lord in the holy mount at Jerusalem.

   13. Accidet etiam die illa, ut clangatur tuba magna; et venient qui
   perierant in terra Assur, et qui dissipati erant in terra Ægypti; et
   adorabunt Iehovam in monte sancto, in Ierusalem.


   1. In that day. Here the Prophet speaks in general of the judgment of
   God, and thus includes the whole of Satan's kingdom. Having formerly
   spoken of the vengeance of God to be displayed against tyrants and
   wicked men who have shed innocent blood, he now proceeds farther, and
   publishes the proclamation of this vengeance.

   On leviathan. The word "leviathan" is variously interpreted; but in
   general it simply denotes either a large serpent, or whales and
   sea-fishes, which approach to the character of monsters on account of
   their huge size. [189] A1though this description applies to the king of
   Egypt, yet under one class he intended also to include the other
   enemies of the Church. For my own part, I have no doubt that he speaks
   allegorically of Satan and of his whole kingdom, describing him under
   the figure of some monstrous animal, and at the same time glancing at
   the crafty wiles by which he glosses over his mischievous designs. In
   this manner he intended to meet many doubts by which we are continually
   assailed, when God declares that he will assist us, and when we
   experience, on the other hand, the strength, craft, and deceitfulness
   of Satan. Wonderful are the stratagems with which he comes prepared for
   doing mischief, and dreadful the cruelty which he exercises against the
   children of God. But the Prophet shews that all this will not prevent
   the Lord from destroying and overthrowing this kingdom. It is indeed
   certain that this passage does not relate to Satan himself, but to his
   agents or instruments, [190] by which he governs his kingdom and annoys
   the Church of God. Now, though this kingdom is defended by innumerable
   cunning devices, and is astonishingly powerful, yet the Lord will
   destroy it.

   To convince us of this, the Prophet contrasts with it the Lord's sword,
   hard, and great, and strong, by which he will easily slay an enemy that
   is both strong and crafty. It ought therefore to be observed, that we
   have continually to do with Satan as with some wild beast, and that the
   world is the sea in which we sail. We are beset by various wild beasts,
   which endeavor to upset our ship and sink us to the bottom; and we have
   no means of defending ourselves and resisting them, if the Lord do not
   aid us. Accordingly, by this description the Prophet intended to
   describe the greatness of the danger which threatens us from enemies so
   powerful and so full of rage and of cunning devices. We should quickly
   be reduced to the lowest extremity, and should be utterly ruined, did
   not God oppose and meet them with his invincible power; for by his
   sword alone can this pernicious kingdom of Satan be destroyed.

   But we must observe what he says in the beginning of the verse, In that
   day. It means that Satan is permitted, for some time, to strengthen and
   defend his kingdom, but that it will at length be destroyed; as Paul
   also declares, "God will quickly bruise Satan under your feet." (Romans
   16:20.) By this promise he shews that the time for war is not yet
   ended, and that we must fight bravely till that enemy be subdued, who,
   though he has been a hundred times vanquished, ceases not to renew the
   warfare. We must therefore fight with him continually, and must resist
   the violent attacks which he makes upon us; but, in order that we may
   not be discouraged, we must keep our eye on that day when his strong
   arm shall be broken.

   On leviathan the piercing serpent, and on leviathan the crooked
   serpent. The epithets applied to "leviathan" describe, on the one hand,
   his tricks and wiles, and, on the other hand, his open violence; but at
   the same time intimate that he is endued with invincible power. Since
   vrych (bariach) signifies a crowbar, that word denotes metaphorically
   the power of piercing, either on account of venomous bites or on
   account of open violence. The second name, qltvn, (gnakallathOn,) is
   derived from the verb ql, (gnakal,) to bend; and hence it comes to be
   applied to crooked and tortuous foldings.

   2. Sing to the vineyard of redness. [191] He now shews that all this
   will promote the salvation of the Church; for the Lord attends to the
   interests of his people, whom he has taken under his guardianship and
   protection. In order, therefore, that the Church may be restored, Satan
   and all his kingdom shall be utterly destroyed. The object of all the
   vengeance which God takes on his enemies is to shew that he takes care
   of the Church; and although in this passage the Prophet does not name
   the Church, he shews plainly enough that he addresses her in this
   congratulation.

   This figure conveys the meaning even more strongly than if he had
   spoken expressly of the people of Israel; for since the whole
   excellence of a vineyard depends partly on the soil in which it is
   planted, and partly on diligent cultivation, if the Church of God is a
   vineyard, we infer that its excellence is owing to nothing else than
   the undeserved favor of God and the uninterrupted continuance of his
   kindness. The same metaphor expresses also God's astonishing love
   towards the Church, of which we spoke largely under the fifth chapter.
   [192]

   He calls it a vineyard of redness, that is, very excellent; for in
   Scripture, if we compare various passages, "red wine" denotes
   excellence. He says that this song may at that time be sung in the
   Church, and foretells that, though it would in the mean time be reduced
   to fearful ruin, and would lie desolate and waste, yet that afterwards
   it will be restored in such a manner as to yield fruit plentifully, and
   that this will furnish abundant materials for singing.

   3. I Jehovah keep it. Here the Lord asserts his care and diligence in
   dressing and guarding the vine, as if he had said, that he left nothing
   undone that belonged to the duty of a provident and industrious
   householder. Not only does he testify what he will do, when the time
   for gladness and congratulation shall arrive, but he relates the
   blessings which the Jews had already received, that their hope for the
   future may be increased. Yet we must supply an implied contrast with
   the intermediate period, during which God appeared to have laid aside
   all care of it, so that at that time it differed little from a
   wilderness. This then is the reason why the Lord's vineyard was
   plundered and laid waste; it was because the Lord forsook it, and gave
   it up as a prey to the enemy. Hence we infer that our condition will be
   ruined as soon as the Lord has departed from us; and if he assist,
   everything will go well.

   I will water it every moment. He next mentions two instances of his
   diligence, that he "will water it every moment," and will defend it
   against the attacks of robbers and cattle and other annoyances. These
   are the two things chiefly required in preserving a vineyard,
   cultivation and protection. Under the word water he includes all that
   is necessary for cultivation, and promises that he will neglect nothing
   that can carry it forward. But protection must likewise be added; for
   it will be to no purpose to have cultivated a vineyard with vast toil,
   if robbers and cattle break in and destroy it. The Lord, therefore,
   promises that he will grant protection, and will not permit it to
   suffer damage, that the fruits may ripen well, and may be gathered in
   due season. Though the vine may suffer many attacks, and though enemies
   and wild beasts may assail it with great violence, God declares that he
   will interpose to preserve it unhurt and free from all danger.
   Moreover, since he names a fixed day for singing this song, let us
   remember that, if at any time he cease to assist us, we ought not
   entirely to cast away hope; and therefore, if he permit us to be
   harassed and plundered for a time, still he will at length shew that he
   has not cast away all care of us.

   4. Fury is not in me. This verse contains excellent consolation; for it
   expresses the incredible warmth of love which the Lord bears towards
   his people, though they are of a wicked and rebellious disposition. God
   assumes, as we shall see, the character of a father who is grievously
   offended, and who, while he is offended at his son, still more pities
   him, and is naturally inclined to exercise compassion, because the
   warmth of his love rises above his anger. In short, he shews that he
   cannot hate his elect so as not to bear fatherly kindness towards them,
   even while he visits them with very severe punishments.

   Scripture represents God to us in various ways. Sometimes it exhibits
   him as burning with indignation, and having a terrific aspect, and
   sometimes as shewing nothing but gentleness and mercy; and the reason
   of this diversity is, that we are not all capable of enjoying his
   goodness. Thus he is constrained to be perverse towards the perverse,
   and holy towards the holy, as David describes him. (Psalm 18:25.) He
   shews himself to us what we suffer him to be, for by our rebelliousness
   we drive him to severity.

   Yet here the Prophet does not speak of all indiscriminately, but only
   of the Church, whose transgressions he chastises, and whose iniquities
   he punishes, in such a manner as not to lay aside a father's affection.
   This statement must therefore be limited to the Church, so as to denote
   the relation between God and his chosen people, to whom he cannot
   manifest himself otherwise than as a Father, while he burns with rage
   against the reprobate. Thus we see how great is the consolation that is
   here given; for if we know that God has called us, we may justly
   conclude that he is not angry with us, and that, having embraced us
   with a firm and enduring regard, it is impossible that he shall ever
   deprive us of it. It is indeed certain that at that time God hated many
   persons who belonged to that nation; but, with respect to their
   adoption, he declares that he loved them. Now, the more kindly and
   tenderly that God loved them, so much the more they who provoked his
   anger by their wickedness were without excuse. This circumstance is
   undoubtedly intended to aggravate their guilt, that their wickedness
   constrains him, in some measure, to change his disposition towards
   them; for, having formerly spoken of his gentleness, he suddenly
   exclaims, --

   "Who shall engage me in battle with the brier and thorn?" or, as some
   render it, "Who shall set me as a brier and thorn?" Yet it might not be
   amiss also to read, "Who shall bring against me a brier, that I may
   meet it as a thorn?" for there is no copulative conjunction between
   those two words. Yet I willingly adhere to the former opinion, that God
   wishes to have to deal with thistles or thorns, which he will quickly
   consume by the fire of his wrath. If any one choose rather to view it
   as a reproof of those doubts which often arise in us in consequence of
   unbelief, when we think that God is inflamed with wrath against us, as
   if he had said, "You are mistaken in comparing me to the brier and
   thorn," that is, "You ascribe to me a harsh and cruel disposition," let
   him enjoy his opinion, though I think that it is different from what
   the Prophet means. [193]

   Others think that God assumes the character of a man who is provoking
   himself to rage; as if he had said, "I do not choose to be any longer
   so indulgent, or to exercise such forbearance as I have formerly
   manifested;" but this is so forced, that it does not need a lengthened
   refutation. It is true, indeed, that since God is gentle and merciful
   in his nature, and there is nothing that is more foreign to him than
   harshness or cruelty, he may be said to borrow a nature that does not
   belong to him. [194] But the interpretation which I have given will of
   itself be sufficient to refute others, namely, that God complains
   bitterly that he will as soon fight with thorns as with his vineyard,
   for when he considers that it is his inheritances he is compelled to
   spare it.

   I will pass through them in a hostile manner, and utterly consume them.
   These words confirm my former exposition; for the burning relates to
   "briers and thorns," and he declares that, if he had to deal with them,
   he would burn them all up, but that he acts more gently, because it is
   his vineyard. Hence we infer that, if God is not enraged against us,
   this must be attributed, not to any merits of men, but to his election,
   which is of free grace. By these words, my ytnny, (mi yittEneni,) "Who
   shall give me?" he plainly shews that he has just cause for contending
   with us, and even for destroying us in a hostile manner, were he not
   restrained by compassion towards his Church; for we would be as thorns
   and briers, and would be like wicked men, if the Lord did not separate
   us from them, that we might not perish along with them. If the phrase
   vmlchmh, (bammilhamah,) in battle, which we have translated "in a
   hostile manner," be connected with the question, "Who shall set me?" it
   will not ill agree with the meaning. [195]

   5. Will she take hold of my strength? 'v (O,) is frequently a
   disjunctive conjunction, [196] and therefore this passage is explained
   as if the particle had been twice used, "Either let her take hold of my
   strength, or let her make peace with me;" that is, "If she do not enter
   into favor with me, she will feel my strength to her great loss."
   Others explain it somewhat differently, "Who shall take hold of my
   strength?" that is, "Who shall restrain me?" But I pass by this
   interpretation, because I consider it to be too far-fetched. I return
   to that which is more generally received.

   It is supposed that God threatens the Jews in order to try all the ways
   and methods by which they may be brought back to the right path; for
   God is laid under a necessity to urge us in various ways, because we
   are accustomed to abuse his forbearance and goodness. On this account
   he frequently threatens to punish us for our ingratitude, as Isaiah
   appears to do in this passage, "If they do not choose to avail
   themselves of my kindness, and repent, that they may return to favor
   with me, they shall feel my strength, [197] which I have hitherto
   restrained." Yet another meaning equally appropriate might perhaps be
   drawn from it, as if God exhorted his people to acknowledge his power,
   which leads them to seek reconciliation; for whence comes that brutish
   indifference which makes us view without alarm the wrath of God, but
   because we do not think of his power with due reverence?

   But I prefer to view it as a question, as in other passages also it
   frequently has this meaning. [198] "Will he take hold of my strength,
   so as to enter into peace with me?" As if a father, anxious and
   perplexed about his son, were to groan and complain, "Will not this
   scoundrel [199] allow himself to receive benefit? for I know not how I
   ought to treat him; he cannot endure severity, and he abuses my
   goodness. What shall I do? I will banish him till he repent, and then
   he will feel how great is that fatherly power by which I have hitherto
   preserved him. Since he does not permit me to exercise forbearance, he
   must be treated with the utmost rigour of the law. Will he not then
   perceive how great my power is, that he may come into a state of favor
   with me?" We shall understand this better, if we consider that the
   source of all our distresses is, that we are not affected with a sense
   of the divine goodness; for if we should take into consideration the
   greatness of the blessings which we have received from God, we should
   quickly be drawn aside from our iniquities and transgressions, and
   should desire to return into a state of favor with him.

   Here we see what care about our salvation is manifested by our Heavenly
   Father, who wishes us to take hold of his power and goodness, that we
   may know how great it is, and may partake of it more and more
   abundantly; for he would wish to deal with us on the same familiar
   terms as with his children, if we did not prevent him by our
   wickedness. Since, therefore, we are incapable of enjoying his fatherly
   tenderness, he must display his strength and majesty, that, being awed
   by it, and affected by the anticipation of the judgment, we may humbly
   entreat him, and sincerely implore peace and pardon. Now, this is done
   when we are truly [200] converted to him; for, so long as we please
   ourselves, and flatter our vices, we cannot but displease him; and, on
   the other hand, if we enter into peace with him, we must make war
   against Satan and sin.

   How earnestly God desires to be reconciled to us appears still more
   clearly from the repetition of the words. He might have said, in a
   single word, that he is merciful and ready to bestow pardon; and
   therefore, when he twice repeats the words, that he may make peace with
   me, he declares that willingly and most earnestly he hastens to blot
   out all our offenses.

   6. Afterwards [201] shall Jacob put forth roots. He now gives actual
   proof of that love of which he formerly spoke. In order to understand
   it better, we must consider the condition of that ancient people; for
   it was the heritage of God, not through its own merits, but by the
   blessing of adoption. The Lord might justly have been offended at that
   nation to such an extent as to destroy it utterly, and blot out its
   name; but he refrained from exercising such severity, because he had to
   deal with his vineyard and heritage. He aimed at nothing more than that
   the people should acknowledge their guilt and return to his favor; and
   therefore he followed up the former statement with this promise, lest
   the people, struck with excessive terror at that power which exhibits
   the judgments of God and his chastisements and stripes, should grow
   disheartened; for the contemplation of the judgment of God might throw
   us into despair, if we did not entertain some hope of being restored.
   Accordingly, he says --

   Jacob shall again put forth roots. "Though I shall lessen my Church,
   and reduce it to a very small number, yet it shall be restored to its
   ancient and flourishing condition, so as to fill the whole world; for,
   after having once been reconciled, it will be more and more increased."
   This metaphor borrowed from roots is highly elegant; for by the wrath
   of the Lord we are as it were cut off, so that we appear to be
   completely slain and dead; but to whatever extent the Lord afflicts his
   Church, he never allows the roots to die, but they are concealed for a
   time, and at length bring forth their fruit.

   And the face of the world shall be filled with fruit. What he now says,
   that "the world shall be filled with the fruit" of those roots, was
   accomplished at the coming of Christ, who collected and multiplied the
   people of God by the gospel; and Israel was united with the Gentiles in
   one body, so that the distinction which formerly existed between them
   was removed. (Ephesians 2:14.) Now, we know that the gospel, and all
   the fruit that sprung from it, proceeded from the Jews. (Isaiah 2:3;
   John 4:22.)

   7. Hath he smitten him? [202] He confirms the former statement, and
   shews that, even in chastisements, there are certain and manifest
   proofs of the goodness and mercy of God; for while the Lord chastises
   his people, he moderates the severity in such a manner as always to
   leave some room for compassion. There are various ways of explaining
   this verse. Some interpret it thus: "Did I smite Israel as his enemies
   smote him? The Assyrians did not at all spare him: they acted towards
   him with the utmost cruelty. But I laid a restraint on my wrath, and
   did not smite as if I wished to destroy him; and thus I gave abundant
   evidence that I am not his enemy." But I prefer another and commonly
   received interpretation, which leads us to understand that a difference
   between believers and the reprobate is here declared; for God punishes
   both indiscriminately, but not in the same manner. When he takes
   vengeance on the reprobate, he gives loose reins to his anger; because
   he has no other object in view than to destroy them; for they are
   "vessels of wrath, appointed to destruction," (Romans 9:22,) and have
   no experience of the goodness of God. But when he chastises the godly,
   he restrains his wrath, and has another and totally different object in
   view; for he wishes to bring them back to the right path, and to draw
   them to himself, that provision may be made for their future happiness.

   But it may be asked, Why does the Prophet employ a circuitous mode of
   expression, and say, "according to the stroke of him that smote him?" I
   answer, he did so, because the Lord often employs the agency of wicked
   men in chastising us, in order to depress and humble us the more. It is
   often a very sore temptation to us, when the Lord permits us to be
   oppressed by the tyranny of wicked men; for we have doubts whether it
   is because he favors them, or because he deprives us of his assistance,
   as if he hated us. To meet this doubt, he says that he does indeed
   permit wicked men to afflict his people, and to exercise their cruelty
   upon them for a time, but that he will at length punish them for their
   wickedness more sharply than they punished the godly persons. Yet, if
   any one choose to adopt the former interpretation, namely, that the
   Lord will not deal with us as with enemies, I have no objection. Hence
   arises also that saying, that "it is better to fall into the hands of
   God than into the hands of men;" for the Lord can never forget his
   covenant, that he will deal in a gentle and fatherly manner with his
   Church. (2 Samuel 24:14; 1 Chronicles 21:13.)

   8. In measure. This is the second proof of the divine compassion
   towards all the elect, whom he chastises for this purpose, that they
   may not perish; and, by mitigating the punishments which he inflicts
   upon them, he pays such regard to their weakness that he never permits
   them to be oppressed beyond measure. As to the word vs's'h,
   (bEsassEah,) in measure, all interpreters agree that it denotes
   moderation; for otherwise we could not bear the hand of the Lord, and
   would be overwhelmed by it; but he keeps it back, and "is faithful," as
   Paul says,

   "not to suffer us to be tempted beyond what we are able to bear."
   (1 Corinthians 10:13.)

   Thus also Jeremiah prays to the Lord to "chastise him in judgment,"
   that is, with moderation, accommodating the stripes to his weakness.
   (Jeremiah 10:24.)

   In her shooting forth, vslchh, (bEshallEchach.) Interpreters are not
   agreed as to the meaning of this word. Some think that it means, "by
   engaging them in internal wars with each other," and others, "that God
   will punish their sins by that sword which they have drawn and put into
   his hand." But as I cannot approve of either of those interpretations,
   I pass them by. I approve more highly of those who interpret it, "in
   her shootings forth," that is, in plants; so as to mean, that in
   inflicting punishment, the Lord attacks not only their outward
   circumstances, but also their persons. We know that the Lord's
   chastisements are various. The more light and moderate are those by
   which he takes from us only external blessings, which are called "the
   good things of fortune." So then God punishes believers in such a
   manner as not only to afflict their persons, but to take from them what
   is necessary for the support of life, such as corn, wine, oil, and
   other things of that kind which the earth produces; for slch(shalach)
   signifies to "shoot forth," and to "produce."

   But I have another exposition which comes nearer to the Prophet's
   meaning, that in shooting forth God contends with the Church, because,
   though he cuts down the branches and even the trunk, yet his wrath does
   not extend to the roots, so as to prevent the tree from again shooting
   forth; for there is always some remaining vigor in the roots, which he
   never permits to die. And this agrees with what goes before, when he
   promised (verse 6) that Israel would bring forth "fruit." This explains
   what he formerly said, in measure; namely, that he will not pull up the
   root; for the Lord cuts down what appears outwardly, such as branches
   and leaves, but defends the root and preserves it safe. But, on the
   other hand, he tears up the reprobate by the roots, and cuts them down
   in such a manner that they can never rise again.

   Though he blow with his violent wind. Some translate it, "he blew with
   his wind," but I think that the meaning is made more clear by saying,
   "though he blow." He continues the metaphor, by which he had alluded to
   herbs and plants, which a violent wind causes to wither, but only in
   appearance; for the root is always safe. Thus though the Lord attacks
   believers with great violence, and takes away all their beauty and
   comeliness, so that they appear to be entirely slain, yet he usually
   preserves in them some internal vigor.

   In the day of the east wind. When the Prophet spoke of "the day of the
   east wind," he had his eye on the situation of Judea, to which, as we
   learn from other passages, that easterly wind was injurious. We know
   that each country has its own particular wind that is injurious to it;
   for in some countries the north wind, in others the south wind, and in
   others the east or equinoctial wind, occasions great damage, throwing
   down the corn, scorching or spoiling all the fruits, blasting the
   trees, and scarcely leaving anything in the fields uninjured. By "the
   east wind" in this passage, is supposed to be meant "the equinoctial
   wind," which in many countries is very destructive.

   9. Therefore in this manner shall the iniquity of Jacob be expiated.
   After having spoken of the chastisement of the people, he begins to
   state more clearly that the Lord promotes the interests of his people
   by these chastisements, so that they derive benefit from them. He had
   mentioned this formerly, but now he explains it more fully, that all
   the chastisements which God inflicts will tend to wash away the sins of
   his people, that thus they may be reconciled to God.

   A question arises, Are our sins expiated by the stripes with which God
   chastises us? For if it be so, it follows that we must satisfy God for
   our sins, as the Papists teach. These two things are closely connected.
   If God punish us for our sins in order to expiate them, when
   punishments are not inflicted, satisfactions must come in their room.
   But this difficulty will be easily removed, if we consider that here
   the Prophet does not handle the question, whether we deserve the
   forgiveness of sins on account of our works, or whether the punishments
   which God inflicts on us may be regarded as making amends for them. He
   simply shews that chastisements are the remedies by which God cures our
   diseases, because we are wont to abuse his goodness and patience. God
   must therefore bring us to acknowledgment of our sins, and to patience;
   and thus the punishments which he inflicts as chastisements for our
   sins are remedies, because our desires may be said to be consumed by
   them as by fire, [203] to which also Scripture frequently compares
   them. (Psalm 66:10; 89:46.) In no respect can they yield satisfaction,
   but men are prepared by them for repentance. Hence he shews, therefore,
   that the godly have no reason for exclaiming against God's
   chastisements, and that they ought to acknowledge, on the contrary,
   that their salvation is thus promoted, because otherwise they would not
   acknowledge the grace of God. If any person wish to have a short reply,
   we may state it in a single word, that chastisements expiate our
   offenses indirectly, but not directly, because they lead us to
   repentance, which again, in its turn, brings us to obtain the
   forgiveness of sins.

   And this is all the fruit, the taking away of his sin. Some render it
   in the genitive case, "the fruit of the taking away of his sin;" but I
   prefer to read it in the nominative case. kl, (chOl,) all, frequently
   means, "great and abundant;" and therefore it denotes the plentiful
   fruit by which the chastisements will be followed. In a word, he
   intends to commend to us God's chastisements on the ground of their
   usefulness, that the godly may bear them with calmness and moderation,
   when they know that by means of them they are purged and prepared for
   salvation. [204] And immediately afterwards the Prophet explains his
   meaning more clearly by speaking of abolishing superstitions. So long
   as the people of Israel enjoyed prosperity, they did not think of
   repentance; for it is natural to men that prosperity should make them
   insolent and harden them more and more. He therefore shews how, in
   chastising his people, God also takes away their sin, because, having
   formerly indulged in wickedness and proceeded to greater lengths in
   sinning in consequence of his goodness and forbearance, they shall now
   know that they were justly punished, and shall change their life and
   conduct.

   When he shall have made all the stones of the altar. Here Isaiah, by a
   figure of speech, exhibits a single class, so as to explain the whole
   by means of a part, and describes in general terms the removal of
   idolatry and superstitions; for he does not speak of the altar which
   was consecrated to God, but of that which they had erected to their
   idols. Thus, when the stones of it shall have been broken, and the
   idols thrown down and destroyed, so that no trace of superstition shall
   be seen, the iniquity of the people shall at the same time be removed.

   Hence it ought to be remarked, first, that we ought not to expect
   pardon from the Lord, unless we likewise repent of our sins; for
   whosoever flatters himself must be the object of the anger of God,
   [205] whom he does not cease to provoke, and our iniquity is taken away
   only when we are moved by a true feeling of repentance. Secondly, it
   ought to be observed, that though repentance is an inward feeling of
   the heart, yet it brings forth its fruits before men. In vain do we
   profess that we fear God, if we do not give evidence of it by outward
   works; for the root cannot be separated from its fruits. Thirdly, it
   ought to be inferred, that idolatry is chiefly mentioned here, because
   it is the source of all evils. So long as the pure worship of God and
   the true religion are maintained, there is also room for the duties of
   brotherly kindness, which necessarily flow from it; but when we forsake
   God, he permits us also to fall into every kind of vices. And this is
   the reason why, under the name of idolatry, he includes likewise other
   acts of wickedness. Besides, we see that he condemns not only statues
   and images, but everything that had been invented by the Jews contrary
   to the injunction of the law; and hence it follows that he sets aside
   every kind of false worship.

   That groves and images may never rise again. By adding this, he shews
   how strongly God abhors idolatry, the remembrance of which he wishes to
   be completely blotted out, so that not even a trace of it shall
   henceforth be seen. Yet the Prophet intended to express something more,
   namely, that our repentance ought to be of such a kind that we shall
   steadfastly persevere in it; for we will not say that it is true
   repentance, if any one, through a sudden impulse of feeling, shall put
   down superstitions, and afterwards shall gradually allow them to spring
   up and bud forth; as we see to be the case with many who at first burn
   with some appearance of zeal, and afterwards grow cold. But here the
   Prophet describes such steadfastness that they who have once laid aside
   their filth and pollution maintain their purity to the end.

   10. Yet the defenced city shall be desolate Here the copulative v (vau)
   is generally supposed to mean for, and some take it for otherwise.
   There will thus be a twofold interpretation; for if we translate it
   because, the Prophet will assign a reason for the former statement, but
   that exposition is rejected by the context, and is altogether absurd.
   With greater plausibility it is taken for otherwise; for this
   threatening might be appropriately introduced, "If you do not repent,
   you see what awaits you, the defenced city shall be like a wilderness."
   But I consider that exposition to be a departure from the natural
   meaning, and therefore I choose rather to take it as signifying
   nevertheless or yet

   The Prophet means that Jerusalem and the other cities of Judea must
   "nevertheless" be destroyed, and that, although the Lord wishes to
   spare his people, it is impossible for them to be preserved. Godly men
   would have grown disheartened, when they saw that holy city overthrown
   and the temple demolished; but from these predictions they learned that
   God would have abundance of methods for preserving the Church, and were
   supported by that consolation. So then the Prophet intended to meet
   this very sore temptation; and hence also we learn that we ought never
   to lose courage, though we suffer every hardship, and though the Lord
   treat us with the utmost severity. Although this threatening extends to
   the whole of Judea, yet I think it probable that it relates chiefly to
   Jerusalem, which was the metropolis of the nation.

   There shall the calf feed. This metaphor is frequently employed by the
   prophets when they speak of the desolation of any city; for they
   immediately add, that it will be a place for pasture. Here we ought to
   take into account the judgment of God, which places calves and brute
   beasts in the room of the Jews who had profaned the land by their
   crimes. Having been adopted by God to be his children, with good reason
   ought they to have obeyed so kind a Father; but since they had shaken
   off the yoke and given themselves up to wickedness, it was the just
   reward of their ingratitude, that the land should be possessed by
   better inhabitants, taken not from the human race but from brute
   beasts.

   And shall browse on its tops. [206] What he says about the "tops" tends
   to shew more strongly the desolation; as if he had said that there will
   be such abundance of grass that the calves will crop none but the
   tender parts. sph (saiph) signifies also branch; but as branches
   naturally rise high, I take it here for summit or top. It might also be
   thought that there is an allusion to the beauty of the city, and that
   as its houses formerly were lofty and magnificent, when these have been
   thrown down, nothing will be seen in it but herbs and leaves, the
   "tops" of which the calves which enjoy abundant pasture will eat in
   disdain.

   11. When its harvest shall wither. [207] Some think that the Prophet
   has in his eye the metaphor of a vineyard, which he employed at the
   beginning of the chapter, and therefore they translate qtsyr (katzir,)
   branches. The word is certainly ambiguous; but as qtsyr (katzir) means
   also a harvest, and as the metaphor of a harvest is more appropriate, I
   prefer to take it in that sense. Nor do I translate it, "When the
   harvest shall be withered," but "When the harvest shall wither." In
   this passage wither means nothing else than to approach to maturity.
   Before the harvest of the land is ripe, it shall be cut down; as if he
   had said, "The Lord will take away from thee the produce which thou
   thoughest to be already prepared for thee and to be in thy hand."

   The women coming shall burn it. When he says that "women shall come,"
   he means that God will have no need of robust soldiers to execute his
   judgment, and that he will only make use of the agency of women. This
   exhibits in a still stronger light the disgracefulness of the
   punishment, for he threatens that the calamity shall also be
   accompanied by disgrace; because it is more shameful and humiliating to
   be plundered by "women," who are unused to war, than by men.

   For it is a people of no understanding. At length he assigns the reason
   of so heavy a calamity. At first sight it might appear to be
   excessively harsh that the Lord should permit the people whom he had
   chosen to be wretchedly tormented and scattered, and not to render them
   any assistance; for it is inconsistent with his kindness and fatherly
   love which he bears towards them. But the Prophet shews that God had
   good reason for punishing the Jews with such severity; for they were
   destitute of knowledge and sound "understanding."

   Nor is it without reason that he pronounces ignorance to have been the
   source of all evils; for since "the fear of God is the beginning of
   wisdom," (Proverbs 1:7; Psalm 111:10,) they who despise God and obey
   the wicked passions of their flesh are justly condemned by the Spirit
   of God as blind and mad. And yet such ignorance does not at all excuse
   us or lessen the guilt of our wickedness; for they who sin are
   conscious of their sinfulness, though they are blinded by their lust.
   Wickedness and ignorance are therefore closely connected, but the
   connection is of such a nature that ignorance proceeds from the sinful
   disposition of the mind. Hence it comes that "ignorance," or
   "ignorances," is the general name given by the Hebrew writers to every
   kind of sin, and hence also that saying of Moses,

   "O that they were wise and understood!"
   (Deuteronomy 32:29.)

   Any man will easily perceive this, if he consider how great is the
   power of evil passions to trouble us; for when we have been deprived of
   the light of doctrine, and are void of understanding, the devil drives
   us as it were to madness, so that we do not dread the arm of God, and
   have no respect for his holy word.

   Therefore their Maker will not have compassion on them. For the purpose
   of still heightening their terror, he at length takes away all hope of
   pardon; for even if a remnant was preserved, the wrath of God did not
   on that account cease to rage against the multitude at large. The
   Prophet here calls God the Maker and Creator of Israel, not in the same
   manner that he is called the Creator of heaven and earth, (Genesis
   1:1,) but inasmuch as he has formed his Church by the Spirit of
   regeneration. In like manner Paul also declares, that in that sense we
   are autou poiema, his workmanship, (Ephesians 2:10,) as we have already
   stated in the exposition of another passage. [208] (Isaiah 19:25.)
   Isaiah made this statement, in order to exhibit more strongly the
   ingratitude of the people, and to shew how justly they deserve to be
   punished, since, after having been formed and preserved by God, they
   treated him with dishonor and contempt.

   12. And yet it shall come to pass on that day. He softens the harshness
   of the former statement; for it was a dreadful judgment of God, that
   the people were deprived of all hope of mercy and favor. The particle v
   (vau) must therefore be explained as in [28]the tenth verse,
   "Nevertheless, or, and yet it shall come to pass on that day."

   That Jehovah shall thrash. The Prophet speaks metaphorically; for he
   compares the gathering of the Church to the "thrashing" of wheat, by
   which the grain is separated from the chaff. The meaning of the
   metaphor is, that the people were so completely overwhelmed by that
   captivity that they appeared to be nothing else than grain concealed or
   scattered here and there under the chaff. It was necessary that the
   Lord should "thrash," as with a fan, what was concealed amidst the
   confused mass; so that this gathering was justly compared to
   "thrashing."

   From the channel of the river to the river of Egypt. By this he means
   Euphrates and the Nile; for the people were banished, partly into
   Chaldea or Assyria, and partly into Egypt. Many fled into Egypt, while
   others were carried captive into Babylon. He therefore foretells that
   the Lord will gather his people, not only from Chaldea, and from the
   whole of Mesopotamia, but also from Egypt.

   And you shall be gathered one by one. l'chd 'chd, (lEahad Ehad,) which
   we have translated "one by one," is translated by others "each out of
   each place;" but this is an excessively forced exposition, and the
   exposition which I have stated appears to me more simple. Yet there are
   two senses which the words will bear; either, "I will gather you into
   one body," or "I will gather you, not in companies nor in great
   numbers, but one after another," as usually happens when men who had
   wandered and been scattered are gathered; for they do not all assemble
   suddenly, but approach to each other by degrees. The Jews were
   scattered and dispersed in such a manner that they could not easily be
   gathered together and formed into one body; and therefore he shews that
   this dispersion will not prevent them from being restored to a
   flourishing condition. This was afterwards fulfilled; for the Jews were
   gathered and brought back, not by a multitude of horsemen or chariots,
   not by human forces, or swords, or arms, as Hosea states, but solely by
   the power of God. (Hosea 1:7.)

   13. It shall also come to pass in that day. This is the explanation of
   the former verse. He speaks metaphorically, and shews that so great
   will be the power of God, that he will easily bring back his people. As
   kings assemble large armies by the sound of a trumpet, so he shews that
   it will be easy for the Lord to gather his people, on whom prophecy had
   not less efficacy than the trumpet by which soldiers are mustered.

   And they shall come who were perishing. He calls them perishing,
   because they were miserably scattered, and appeared to be very near
   destruction, without any hope of being restored. The enemies, while
   their monarchy lasted, would never have permitted their captives to
   return, nor had they led them into banishment in a distant country with
   any other design than that of gradually casting into oblivion the name
   of Israel.

   And who had been scattered in the land of Egypt. What he adds about
   Egypt contains a more remarkable testimony of pardon, namely, that
   those who fled into Egypt, though they did not deserve this favor,
   shall be gathered. They had offended God in two respects, as Jeremiah
   plainly shews; first, because they were obstinate and rebellious; and,
   secondly, because they had refused to obey the revelation, (Jeremiah
   28:10, 11;) for they ought to have submitted to the yoke of the
   Babylonians rather than flee into Egypt in opposition to the command of
   God.

   And shall worship Jehovah in the holy mountain. At length, he describes
   the result of their deliverance, that the Jews, having returned from
   captivity into their country, may again worship God their deliverer in
   a pure and lawful manner. By the mountain he means the temple and
   sacrifices. This was indeed accomplished under Darius, but the Prophet
   undoubtedly intended to extend this prophecy farther; for that
   restoration was a kind of dark foreshadowing of the deliverance which
   they obtained through Christ, at whose coming the sound of the
   spiritual trumpet, that is, of the gospel, was heard, not only in
   Assyria or Egypt, but in the most distant parts of the world. Then were
   the people of God gathered, to flow together to Mount Zion, that is, to
   the Church. We know that this mode of expression is frequently employed
   by the prophets when they intend to denote the true worship of God, and
   harmony in religion and godliness; for they accommodated themselves to
   the usages of the people that they might be better understood. We know
   also that the gospel proceeded out of Zion; but on this subject we have
   spoken fully at the second chapter. [209]

   [189] "The word leviathan, which, from its etymology, appears to mean
   contorted, coiled, is sometimes used to denote particular species,
   (e.g., the crocodile,) and sometimes as a generic term for huge aquatic
   animals, or the larger kind of serpents, in which sense the
   corresponding term! tnyn (tannin) is also used. They both appear to be
   employed in this case to express the indefinite idea of a formidable
   monster, which is in fact the sense now commonly attached to the word
   dragon." -- Alexander ^FT447 Ses organes et instrumens ^FT448 "Chantez
   à la vigne rouge;" -- "Sing to the red vineyard." ^Ft449 See Commentary
   on Isaiah, [29]vol. 1 p. 162 ^FT450 "Si quelqu'un est de cet advis, je
   n'empesche point qu'il ne le suive;" -- "If any one is of that opinion,
   I do not hinder him from following it." ^FT451 "Tellement qu'il est
   constraint comme l'emprunter d'ailleurs quand il se courrouce;" -- "So
   that he is compelled, as it were, to borrow it from another quarter
   when he is enraged." ^FT452 That is, instead of making it the beginning
   of the following sentence, "in battle (or, in a hostile manner) I will
   pass through them," it might be read as the conclusion of the question,
   "Who shall engage me with briers and thorns in battle?" And this
   concluding suggestion accords with our English version. -- Ed ^FT453
   "Of the various senses ascribed to 'v, (O,) such as unless, oh that if,
   etc., the only one justified by usage is the disjunctive sense of or."
   -- Alexander ^FT454 "Ils sentiront la pesanteur de ma main;" -- "They
   shall feel the weight of my hand." ^FT455 That is, our Author is of
   opinion that 'v (O) frequently has the same force as the Latin
   interrogative particle An. -- Ed ^FT456 "Ce vaut-neant-ci;" -- "This
   good-for-nothing." ^FT457 "Sans feintise;" -- "Without hypocrisy."
   ^FT458 Such is Calvin's translation of v'ym, (baim,) coming, which,
   occupying a somewhat anomalous position at the beginning of the verse,
   has perplexed the critics. The usual and best defended supplement is
   ymym, (yamim,) days, and thus the construction is supposed to be, "In
   coming days." The French version takes ci-apres, "hereafter;" the
   Italian has Ne' giorni a venire, "In the days to come;" Luther's
   version has As mirb bennoch bazu fummen, "Yet it will come to this."
   Our English version connects the word with "Jacob," and makes it to
   signify "Them that come of Jacob," which is countenanced by the
   Septuagint, hoi erchomenoi tekna Iakob, "They that come, the children
   of Jacob," but does not appear to have the support of any modern critic
   or version. -- Ed ^FT459 "Hath he smitten him as he smote (Heb.,

   manner as if fire had passed on them." ^FT461 "Et mis en chemin de

   flatte en son ordure, il attirera sur sa teste infalliblement l'ire de
   Dieu;" -- "Whosoever flatters himself in his pollution will infallibly
   draw down on his head the wrath of God." ^FT463 "And consume the
   branches thereof." -- Eng. Ver. ^FT464 "When the boughs thereof are
   withered." -- Eng. Ver. ^FT465 See [30]p. 83 ^FT466 See Commentary on
   Isaiah, [31]vol. 1 p. 96 ^FT467 "Whose glorious beauty is a fading
   flower." -- Eng. Ver. ^FT468 "Woe to Samaria, the proud chaplet of the
   drunkards of Ephraim, which stands at the head of a rich valley
   belonging to a race of sots! Sebaste, the ancient Samaria, is situated
   on a long mount of an oval figure, having first a fruitful valley, and
   then a ring of hills running round about it.' -- Maundrell, p. 58.
   Hence it is likened to a chaplet, or wreath of flowers, worn upon the
   head by Jews, as well as Greeks and Romans, at their banquets, as may
   be seen, Wisd. 2:7, 8." -- Stock ^FT469 "De la vallee grasse;" -- "Of
   the fat valley." ^FT470 "Tyran de Sicile;" -- "Tyrant of Sicily."
   ^FT471 Justin, in a rapid sketch of that tyrant, informs us that,
   "after having defeated his rivals, he abandoned himself to indolence
   and gluttony, which brought on such weakness of sight that he could not
   bear day-light; that the consciousness of being despised on account of
   his blindness made him more cruel than before, and led him to fill the
   city with murders as much as his father had filled the jails with
   prisoners, so that he became universally hated and despised." --
   Justin, Hist. 1. 21, c. 11. The appalling facts are confirmed by other
   historians. -- Ed ^FT472 "Puis donc qu'ils sont coulpables d'une mesme

   ^FT485 From which the noun ltsvn (latzOn) is derived. The phrase 'nsy
   ltsvn (anshelatzon) literally signifies "men of scorn," and is so
   rendered by Stock and others; but the force of the Hebrew idiom is
   fully brought out by the word "scoffers," as in Lowth, or by "scornful
   men," as in the English Version. -- Ed ^FT486 "Ces moqueurs;" -- "Those
   mockers." ^FT487 chzh (chOzEh) is properly a participle (seeing) often
   used as a noun to denote a seer or prophet. Here the connection seems
   distinctly to require the sense of league or covenant. That there is no
   error in the text may be inferred from the substitution of the cognate
   form chzvt (chUzuth) in verse 18. Hitzig accounts for the transfer of
   meanings by the supposition that in making treaties it was usual to
   consult the seer or prophet. Ewald supposes an allusion to the practice
   of necromantic art or divination as a safeguard against death, and
   translates the word orafel, (oracle.) The more common explanation of
   the usage traces it to the idea of an interview or meeting, and the act
   of looking one another in the face, from which the transition is by no
   means difficult to that of mutual understanding or agreement." --
   Alexander. Buxtorf renders it "a seer, or prophet," and, by a
   transferred meaning, "provision," or "foresight," "We have made
   provision, we have looked forward, we have acted with foresight;" and
   adds, that the Chaldee version renders it slm', (shEluma,) peace. -- Ed
   ^FT488 "Car c'eust esté une chose trop ridicule et dont les petits
   enfans se fussent moquez;" "For it would have been too absurd, and even
   young children would have laughed at it." ^FT489 Lucian is often
   alluded to by our Author as the type of daring and scornful infidels.

   leurs dents;" -- "Even in spite of their teeth." ^FT493 "Qu'il leur
   pend une horrible calamité sur leurs testes, laquelle ils ne voyent
   point;" -- "That there hangs over their heads a dreadful calamity which
   they do not see." ^FT494 "And it shall be a vexation only to understand
   the report. Or, when he shall make you to understand doctrine." --
   (Eng. Ver.) "And even the report alone shall cause terror." -- Lowth.
   "And it shall be terror merely to hear the report of it." -- Stock.
   "And only vexation (or distress) shall be the understanding of the
   thing heard." -- Alexander. "E'l sentirne il grido non produrrà altro
   che commovimento;" -- "And to hear the cry of it will produce nothing
   but distress." -- (Ital. Ver.) ^FT495 "There are three interpretations
   of the last clause, one of which supposes it to mean, that the mere
   report of the approaching scourge should fill them with distress;
   another, that the effect of the report should be universal distress; a
   third, that nothing but a painful experience would enable them to
   understand the lesson which the Prophet was commissioned to teach them.
   smvh (shEmugnah) meaning simply what is heard, may of course denote
   either rumor or revelation. The latter seems to be the meaning in verse
   9, where the noun stands connected with the same verb as here. Whether
   this verb ever means simply to perceive or hear, may be considered
   doubtful; if not, the preference is due to the third interpretation
   above given, viz., that nothing but distress or suffering could make
   them understand or even attend to the message from Jehovah." --

   simile from the various methods used by the husbandman in preparing his

   those who might question divine providence, because sentence against
   the wicked is not executed speedily. God, who teacheth the farmer the
   proper time and manner of treating his crop, knoweth best when and how
   to punish sinners: he reduceth them not to dust at once, any more than
   corn is suffered to lie under pressure till it is rendered
   unserviceable, but chastiseth in mercy, in order to reclaim them." --

   in the appointed place, and barley in the appointed place." -- Eng.
   Ver. "The choice wheat and the picked barley." -- Stock. "The wheat in
   due measure." -- Lowth ^FT504 "The words svrh (sOrah) and nmsn (nImsan)
   are by some explained as epithets of the grain; principal wheat,
   appointed or sealed barley. Ewald makes them descriptive of the soil;
   wheat in the best ground, barley in the rough ground. But the
   explanation best sustained by usage and analogy is that of Gesenius,
   who takes nmsn (nImsan) in the sense of appointed, designated, and svrh
   (sOrah) in that of a row or series." -- Alexander ^FT505 "Car en France

   harrow over the nations." ^FT507 "Comme si les meschans avoyent la
   bride sur le col;" -- "As if the wicked had the bridle on their neck."

   CHAPTER 28
     __________________________________________________________________

   Isaiah 28:1-29

   1. Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose
   glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat
   valleys of them that are overcome with wine!

   1. Væ coronæ superbiæ temulentorum Ephraim; quia decor gloriæ ejus erit
   flos deciduus, quæ est super caput vallis pinguium, oppresorum a vino.

   2. Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which, as a tempest
   of hail, and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters
   overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.

   2. Ecce durus et fortis Domino, sicut inundatio grandinis, turbo
   subvertens; sicut impetus aquarum vehementium inundantium, dejiciens in
   manu ad terram.

   3. The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under
   feet:

   3. Pedibus conculabitur corona superbiæ temultorum Ephraim.

   4. And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley,
   shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer;
   which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand
   he eateth it up.

   4. Et erit flos deciduus decor gloriæ ejus, quæ est super caput vallis
   pinguium, quasi fructus præcox ante æstivos, quem qui viderit,
   aspiciens eum dum adhuc in manu est, devorat.

   5. In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for
   a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people.

   5. In illa die Iehova exercituum in corona gloriæ, et diadema decoris
   reliquiis populi sui,

   6. And for spirit of judgement to him that sitteth in judgement, and
   for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.

   6. Et in spiritum judicii sedenti super tribunal, et in fortitudinem
   propulsantibus proelium ad portam.

   7. But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are
   out of the way: the priest and the prophet have erred through strong
   drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through
   strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.

   7. At isti quoque præ vino errarunt, præ sicera hallucinati sunt.
   Sacerdos et propheta errarunt præ sicera, absorpti sunt a vino;
   hallucinati sunt præ sicera, errarunt in visione, impegerunt in
   judicio.

   8. For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no
   place clean

   8. Quoniam omnes mensæ plenæ sunt vomitu stercoreo, ut locus non vacet.

   9. Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand
   doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the
   breasts.

   9. Quem docebit scientiam, et quem intelliegere faciet doctrinam?
   Abductos a lacte, abstractos ab uberibus?

   10. For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon
   line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little.

   10. Quoniam præceptum ad præceptum, præceptum ad præceptum; instructio
   ad instructionem, instructio ad instructionem; paululum ibi, paululum
   ibi.

   11. For with stammering lips, and another tongue, will he speak to this
   people.

   11. Quoniam balbis labiis et lingua exotica loquetur ad populum istum.

   12. To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary
   to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.

   12. Quoniam illis dixit, Hæc est requies; requiescere facite lassum, et
   hoc refrigerium; et noluerunt audire.

   13. But the word of the Lord was unto them precept upon precept,
   precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little,
   and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be
   broken, and snared, and taken.

   13. Erit igitur illis verbum Iehovæ regula ad regulam, regula ad
   regulam; instructio ad instructonem, instructio ad instructionem;
   paululum ibi, paululum ibi; propterea ibunt, et corruent retrorsum,
   conterentur, irretientur et capientur.

   14. Wherefore hear the word of the Lord, ye scornful men, that rule
   this people which is in Jerusalem.

   14. Propterea audite verbum Iehovæ, viri illusores, qui dominamini
   populo huic, qui est in Ierusalem.

   15. Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with
   hell are we at agreement; when overflowing scourge shall pass through,
   it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under
   falsehood have we hid ourselves.

   15. Quia dixitis, Percussimus foedus cum morte, et cum inferno fecimus
   pactum; flagellum inundans cum transierit, non veniet ad nos; quia
   posuimus mendacium refugium nostrum, et sub vanitate sumus absconditi.

   16. Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a
   foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner-stone, a sure
   foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.

   16. Quare sic dicit Donminus Iehova: Ecce ego ponam in Sion lapidem,
   lapidem probationis, angulum pretiosum, fundamentum solidum. Qui credit
   non festinabit.

   17. Judgement also will I lay to the line, and righteouseness to the
   plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the
   waters shall overflow the hiding-place.

   17. Et ponam judicium ad regulam, et justitiam ad mensuram (vel,
   trutinam.) Everret grando fiduciam mendacii, et latibulum aquæ
   inundabunt.

   18. And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your
   agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall
   pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.

   18. Et abolebitur pactum cum morte; visio vestra cum inferno non
   stabit, flagellum inundans cum transierit, tunc eritis ei in
   conculcationem.

   19. From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by
   morning shall it pass over, by day and by night; and it shall be a
   vexation only to understand the report.

   19. Ex quo transierit, rapiet vos utique mane quotidie, transibit
   interdiu et noctu. Et erit ut terror (vel commotio) duntaxat
   intelligere faciat auditum.

   20. For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it;
   and the covering narrower that that he can wrap himself in it

   20. Quoniam contractus est lectus, ut non sufficiat; angusta erit
   stragula colligendo.

   21. For the Lord shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth
   as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work;
   and bring to pass his act, his strange act.

   21. Quoniam sicut in monte Perazim stabit Iehova, et sicut in valle
   Gibeon, irascetur (vel, tumultuabitur) ad faciendum opus suum, alienum
   opus suum; ad designandum facinus suum, alienum facinus suum.

   22. Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong;
   for I have heard from the Lord God of hosts a consumption, even
   determined upon the whole earth.

   22. Nunc itaque ne sitis illusores; ne forte constringantur vincula
   vestra. Quoniam consumptionem et finitionem audivi a Domino Iehova
   exercituum super universam terram.

   23. Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.

   23. Auscultate, et audite vocem meam; advertite et audite sermonem
   meum.

   24. Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the
   clods of his ground?

   24. An quotidie arat arator, ut seminet? aperit et confringit glebas
   agri sui?

   25. When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad
   the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat,
   and the appointed barley, and the rye, in their place?

   25. Annon cum æquaverit faciem ejus, tunc sparget viciam, seret
   cyminum, et ponet triticum in mensura, hordeum demensum, et speltam suo
   modo?

   26. For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him.

   26. Docet eum rectitudinem Deus suus, et instituit eum.

   27. For the fitches are not thrashed with a thrashing-instrument,
   neither is a cart-wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches
   are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.

   27. Certe non triturabitur vicia tabula dentata, nec rota plaustri
   super cyminum circumferetur; quia baculo excutitur vicia, et cyminum
   virga.

   28. Bread-corn is bruised; because he will not ever be thrashing it,
   nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his
   horsemen.

   28. Triticum licet trituretur, non in perpetuum triturat ipsum, nec
   rotam plaustri sui perpetuo strepere facit, ne dentibus suis conterat
   ipsum.

   29. This also cometh forth from the Lord of hosts, which is wonderful
   in counsel, and excellent in working.

   29. Etiam hoc ab Iehova exercituum egressum est, qui mirificus est,
   consilio et magnificus opere.


   1. Woe to the crown of pride. Isaiah now enters on another and
   different subject from that which goes before it; for this discourse
   must be separated from the former one. He shews that the anger of the
   Lord will quickly overtake, first, Israel, and afterwards the Jews; for
   it is probable that the kingdom of Israel was still entire when the
   Prophet uttered these predictions, though nothing more can be affirmed
   with certainty than that there is good reason to believe that the ten
   tribes had not at that time been led into captivity.

   Accordingly, the Prophet follows this order. First, he shews that the
   vengeance of God is not far from Israel, because various sins and
   corruption of every kind prevailed in it; for they were swelled with
   pride and insolence, had plunged into their luxuries and given way to
   every kind of licentiousness, and, consequently, had broken out into
   open contempt of God, as is usually the case when men take excessive
   liberties; for they quickly forget God. Secondly, he shews that God in
   some measure restrains his anger by sparing the tribe of Judah; for
   when the ten tribes, with the half tribe of Benjamin, had been carried
   into captivity, the Jews still remained entire and uninjured. Isaiah
   extols this compassion which God manifested, in not permitting his
   Church to perish, but preserving some remnant. At the same time he
   shews that the Jews are so depraved and corrupted that they do not
   permit God to exercise this compassion, and that, in consequence of the
   wickedness which prevailed among them, not less than in Israel, they
   too must feel the avenging hand of God. This order ought to be
   carefully observed; for many persons blunder in the exposition of this
   passage, because the Prophet has not expressly mentioned the name of
   Israel, though it is sufficiently known that Ephraim includes the ten
   tribes.

   As to the words, since the particle hvy (hOi) very frequently denotes
   "wishing evil on a person," I was unwilling to depart from the ordinary
   opinion of commentators, more especially because the Prophet openly
   threatens in this passage; yet if the translation, Alas the crown! be
   preferred, I have no objection.

   For the excellence of its glory shall be a fading flower [210] The
   copulative v (vau) signifies for or because. He compares the "glory"
   and "excellence" of Israel to "a fading flower," as will afterwards be
   stated. In general, he pronounces a curse on the wealth of the
   Israelites; for by the word "Crown" he means nothing else than the
   wicked confidence with which they were puffed up, and which proceeded
   from the excess of their riches. These vices are almost always joined
   together, because abundance and fullness produce cruelty and pride; for
   we are elated by prosperity, and do not know how to use it with
   moderation. They inhabited a rich and fertile country, and on this
   account Amos (Amos 4:1) calls them "fat cows," which feed on the
   mountain of Samaria. Thus, being puffed up by their wealth, they
   despised both God and men. The Prophet calls them "drunkards," because,
   being intoxicated by prosperity, they dreaded no adversity, and thought
   that they were beyond the reach of all danger, and that they were not
   even subject to God himself.

   A fading flower. He alludes, I doubt not, to the crowns or chaplets
   [211] which were used at banquets, and which are still used in many
   places in the present day. The Israelites indulged in gluttony and
   drunkenness, and the fertility of the soil undoubtedly gave occasion to
   their intemperance. By calling it "a fading flower" he follows out his
   comparison, elegantly alluding to flowers which suddenly wither.

   Which is on the head of the valley of fatness. [212] He says that that
   glory is "on the head of the valley of fatness," because they saw under
   their feet their pastures, the fertility of which still more inflamed
   their pride. smnym (shEmanim) is translated by some "of ointments;" but
   that is inapplicable, for it denotes abundance and fullness, which led
   them to neglect godliness and to despise God. By the word "head" or
   "top," he alludes to the position of the country, because the
   Israelites chiefly inhabited rich valleys. He places on it a crown,
   which surrounds the whole kingdom; because it was flourishing and
   abounded in every kind of wealth. This denotes riches, from which arose
   sluggishness, presumption, rashness, intemperance, and cruelty. This
   doctrine relates to us also; for the example of these men reminds us
   that we ought to use prosperity with moderation, otherwise we shall be
   very unhappy, for the Lord will curse all our riches and abundance.

   2. Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one. This may refer to the
   Assyrians, as if he had said, that they will be ready at God's command
   to fight under his authority, as soon as they shall be called. Yet I
   prefer to take it without a substantive, to mean either "a staff," or
   some other instrument, by which the Lord will cast them down from this
   lofty pride.

   As a deluge of hail. He compares it to "a deluge" or to "hail," by
   which both herbs and flowers are thrown down, and all the beauty of the
   earth is marred. Thus he continues the metaphor of the "fading flower,"
   which he had introduced at the beginning of the chapter; for nothing
   can be more destructive to flowers than a heavy shower or "hail." He
   makes use of the demonstrative particle hnh, (hinneh,) behold; because
   wicked men are not moved by any threatenings, and therefore he shews
   that he does not speak of what is doubtful, or conjecture at random,
   but foretells those things which will immediately take place.

   Casting them down with the hand to the earth. vyd, (bEyad,) which I
   have translated "with the hand," is translated by Jerome, "a spacious
   country," which does not agree with the words. Others take it for
   "strength," so as to mean a violent casting down. But the plain meaning
   appears to me to be, that the glory and splendor of the Israelites will
   be laid low, as if one threw down a drunk man "with the hand." The same
   statement is confirmed by him in the third verse.

   4. And the excellence of its glory. He repeats nearly the same words;
   for we know how difficult it is to terrify and humble those who have
   been blinded by prosperity, and whose eyes success covers in the same
   manner that fatness would. As Dionysius the Second, [213] in
   consequence of gorging himself at unseasonable banquets, was seized
   with such blindness that he constantly stumbled, so pleasures and
   luxuries blind the minds of men in such a manner that they no longer
   know either God or themselves. The Prophet therefore inculcates the
   same truth frequently on the minds of men who were stupid and amazed,
   that they might understand what would otherwise have appeared to them
   to be incredible. [214]

   As the hasty fruit before the summer. He now illustrates the subject by
   another metaphor exceedingly beautiful and appropriate; for the
   first-ripe fruits are indeed highly commended, because they go before
   others, and hold out the expectation of the rest of the produce; but
   they last but a short time, and cannot be preserved, for they are
   quickly eaten up either by pregnant women, or by children, or by men
   who do not make a proper selection of their food. He says that the
   happiness of the Israelites will be of that sort, because their
   flourishing prosperity will not be of long duration, but will be
   swallowed up in a moment. What Isaiah declared about the kingdom of
   Israel, applies also to the whole world. By their ingratitude men
   prevent all the goodness which the Lord has bestowed on them from
   reaching maturity; for we abuse his blessings and corrupt them by our
   wickedness. The consequence is, that hasty and short-lived fruits are
   produced, which could not yield to us continual nourishment.

   5. In that day shall the Lord of hosts. After having spoken of the
   kingdom of Israel, he passes to the tribe of Judah, and shews that,
   amidst this severe vengeance of God, there will still be room for
   compassion, and that, although ten tribes perished, yet the Lord will
   preserve some remnant, which he will consecrate to himself; so that
   there will be in it a crown of glory and diadem of excellence, that is,
   that the Church is never disfigured in such a manner that the Lord does
   not adorn it with beauty and splendor.

   Yet I do not extend this prophecy indiscriminately to all the Jews, but
   to the elect who were wonderfully rescued from death; for although he
   calls the tribe and half-tribe a remnant, as compared with the other
   ten tribes, yet, as we advance, we shall see that he makes a
   distinction between the tribe of Judah itself and the others. Nor ought
   we to wonder that the Prophet speaks differently about the same people,
   directing his discourse, sometimes to a body corrupted by crimes, and
   sometimes to the elect. Certainly, as compared with the ten tribes,
   which had revolted from the worship of God and from the unity of faith,
   he justly calls the Jews a remnant of the people; but when he leaves
   out of view this comparison, and considers what they are in themselves,
   he remonstrates with equal justice against their corruptions.

   I am aware that some expound it differently, on account of what is said
   immediately afterwards about wine and strong drink, (verse 7,) and
   think that this statement ought to be viewed in connection with the
   beginning of the chapter. Yet perhaps the Lord spares the Jews. But how
   would he spare them? They are in no respect better than the others; for
   they are equally in fault, [215] and must also be exposed to the same
   punishments. But those commentators do not consider that the Prophet
   holds out an instance of the extraordinary kindness of God, in not
   exercising his vengeance at the same time against the whole family of
   Abraham, but, after having overthrown the kingdom of Israel, granting a
   truce to the Jews, to see if they would in any degree repent. Neither
   do they consider that, by the same means, he employs the circumstance
   which he had stated for placing in a stronger light the ingratitude of
   the people, that is, that they ought to have been instructed by the
   example of their brethren; [216] for the calamity of Israel ought to
   have aroused and excited them to repentance, but it produced no
   impression on them, and did not make them better. Although therefore
   they were unworthy of so great benefits, yet the Lord was pleased to
   preserve his Church in the midst of them; for this is the reason why he
   rescued the tribe of Judah, and the half-tribe of Benjamin, from that
   calamity.

   Now, since the tribe of Judah was a small portion of the nation, and
   therefore was despised by the haughty Israelites, the Prophet declares
   that in God alone there is enough of riches and of glory to supply all
   earthly defects. And hence he shews what is the true method of our
   salvation, namely, if we place our happiness in God; for as soon as we
   come down to the world, we gather fading flowers, which immediately
   wither and decay. This madness reigns everywhere, and more than it
   ought to be among ourselves, that we wish to be happy without God, that
   is, without happiness itself. Besides, Isaiah shews that no calamities,
   however grievous, can prevent God from adorning his Church; for when it
   shall appear that everything is on the eve of destruction, God will
   still be a crown of glory to his people. It is also worthy of
   observation, that Isaiah promises new splendor to the Church only when
   the multitude shall be diminished, that believers may not lose courage
   on account of that dreadful calamity which was at hand.

   6. And for a spirit of judgment. He explains the manner in which the
   Lord will adorn that "remnant" with additional splendor; for he holds
   out instances of the true art of civil government, which mainly
   contributes to the upholding of nations. It consists chiefly of two
   things, counsel and strength. The internal administration must be
   conducted by counsel and wisdom, and "strength" and force are needed
   against enemies who are without. Since therefore it is by these two
   defences that kingdoms and commonwealths defend and uphold their rank,
   he promises to his people the spirit of "wisdom" and "strength." At the
   same time he shews that it is God who gives both, and that they ought
   not to be expected from any other; for magistrates will not be able to
   rule and to administer justice in a city, and military generals will
   not be able to repel enemies, unless the Lord shall direct them.

   7. But they also have erred through wine. He returns to the irreligious
   despisers of God, who were Jews in name only, and proves their
   ingratitude to be highly aggravated, because, though they had before
   their eyes a striking proof of the anger of God, when they saw their
   brethren severely chastised, and not withstanding experienced God's
   forbearance towards themselves, yet neither that example of severity,
   nor the conviction of the divine goodness, could bring them back into
   the right path, or make them in any respect better, although the Lord
   spared them. Here he speaks of "wine and strong drink" metaphorically;
   for I do not understand it to relate to ordinary drunkenness, against
   which he remonstrated at the beginning of the chapter, but, on the
   contrary, he says that they were like drunk men, because they wanted
   knowledge and sound understanding. If the word as be supplied before
   the words "through wine and through strong drink," the meaning will be
   more easily understood. I do acknowledge that by continued drunkenness
   men become, as it were, brutalized, and I have no doubt that
   drunkenness and excessive eating and drinking contributed also to
   stupefy the minds of the Jews; but if we examine the whole of the
   context, it will be easy to see that the madness which he condemns is
   metaphorical.

   The priest and the prophet have erred. He proceeds still farther to
   exhibit their aggravated guilt, and says that not only the common
   people were drunk, but the priests themselves, who ought to have held
   out the light and pointed out the path to others; for, as Christ
   declares, they may be regarded as "the salt of the earth." (Matthew
   5:13.) If they are mad, what shall the common people be? "If the eye is
   blind," what shall become of the other parts of the body? (Matthew
   6:23.)

   They have erred in vision. The most grievous thing of all is, when he
   says that they err not only in the more flagrant transgressions of
   life, but in vision and judgment. Hence we ought to infer how desperate
   was the condition of the Jewish Church, and here, as in a mirror, we
   may behold our transgressions. It is indeed something monstrous that,
   after so many chastisements which God has employed for cleansing it,
   the Church is so deeply corrupted; but such is our wickedness that we
   fight against his strokes, [217] and though he continually restrains
   us, and uses unceasing efforts to purify us from our sins, we not only
   render all his remedies useless, but bring upon ourselves new diseases.
   We ought not therefore to wonder that in the present day, after the
   numerous scourges and afflictions with which the Church has been
   chastised, men appear to be obstinate, and even become worse, when
   Isaiah testifies that the same thing took place in the ancient Church.
   True, indeed, the goodness of the Lord rose above the base and shameful
   wickedness of that nation, and still preserved the Church; but this was
   accomplished by his secret power, contrary to the expectation of all;
   for it would be of no advantage to us, if he employed ordinary
   remedies.

   Hence also it is evident how silly and childish is the boasting of the
   Papists, who always have in their mouth "The Church," and use as a
   pretext the names of priests, bishops, and pontiffs, and wish to
   fortify themselves by their authority against the word of God, as if
   that order could never err or mistake. They think that they have the
   Holy Spirit confined within their brains, and that they represent the
   Church, which God never forsakes. But we see what the Prophet declares
   concerning the priests, whose order was more splendid and illustrious.
   If ever there was a Church, there certainly was one at that time among
   the Jews; and that order derived from the word of God support to which
   they have no claim. And yet he shews that not only were they corrupt in
   morals, but erred "in vision and judgment," and that the prophets, whom
   we know that God added to the priests, out of the ordinary course, on
   account of the carelessness of the priests, were nevertheless blind in
   that sacred office of teaching and in revelations. Nothing therefore is
   more idle than, under the pretext of an office which bears a splendid
   title, to hold out as exempt from the danger of erring those who,
   having forsaken God, and not only cast away all regard to religion, but
   even trodden shame under their feet, defend their tyranny by every
   means in their power.

   8. For all tables are full of vomiting. He pursues the same metaphor,
   and draws, as it were, a picture of what usually happens to men who are
   given up to drunkenness; for they forget shame, and not only debase
   themselves like beasts, but shrink from nothing that is disgraceful. It
   is certainly an ugly and revolting sight to see "tables covered with
   vomiting;" and, accordingly, under this figure Isaiah describes the
   whole life of the people as shameful beyond endurance. There can be no
   doubt that the Prophet intended to express by a single word, that no
   sincerity or uprightness was left among the Jews. If we approach their
   tables, we can find nothing but foul drunkenness; if we look at their
   life, no part of it is pure or free from crimes and enormities.
   Doctrine itself is so corrupt that it stinks as if it were polluted by
   vomiting and filth. In expounding allegories, I have no intention to
   enter, as some do, into ingenious disquisitions.

   9. Whom shall he teach knowledge? Here the Prophet shews by an
   expression of amazement, that the disease of the people is incurable,
   and that God has no other remedies adapted to cure them, for he has
   tried every method without effect. When he calls wanderers to return to
   the right path, and unceasingly warns those who are thoughtlessly going
   astray, this undoubtedly is an extraordinary remedy; and if it do no
   good, the salvation of those who refuse to accept of any aid from a
   physician is utterly hopeless.

   Those who are weaned from the milk. The Prophet complains that the
   stupidity of the people may be said to hinder God from attempting to
   cure them of their vices; and therefore he compares the Jews to very
   young infants, [218] or who are but beginning to prattle, and whom it
   would be a waste of time to attempt to teach. Justly indeed does Peter
   exhort believers to draw near, "like infants newly born, to suck the
   milk of pure doctrine;" for no man will ever shew himself to be willing
   to be taught until he has laid aside that obstinacy which is the
   natural disposition of all. [219] (1 Peter 2:2.) But now the Prophet
   condemns another kind of infancy, in which men who are stupefied by
   their vices pay no more regard to heavenly doctrine than if they had no
   understanding whatsoever. It is therefore a mistake to connect this
   statement of the Prophet with that passage in the Apostle Peter, as if
   Isaiah represented God as desirous to obtain disciples who had divested
   themselves of all pride, and were like infants lately weaned; for the
   Prophet, on the contrary, loudly complains, that to "teach doctrine" is
   useless, and merely provokes ridicule among stupid and senseless
   persons, who are "children, not in malice, but in understanding," as
   Paul speaks. (1 Corinthians 14:20.) From what follows it will more
   clearly appear that, since they were unfit for receiving doctrine, God
   cannot be accused of undue severity if he reject them, and if he
   resolve not to bestow useless labor by thundering in their ears any
   longer.

   10. For precept must be on precept. This shews plainly that the Lord
   complains of spending his labor to no purpose in instructing this
   unteachable people, just as if one were to teach children, who must
   have elementary instructions repeated to them over and over again, and
   quickly forget them, and when the master has spent a whole day in
   teaching them a single letter, yet on the following day and afterwards,
   the same labor must be renewed, and though he leave nothing untried
   that care or diligence can do, still they will make no progress under
   him. Those who change the words of this verse, in order to avoid
   offending the ears of the readers, [220] obscure the Prophet's meaning
   through a foolish affectation of copiousness of language, and even
   destroy the elegance of the style; for, by using the same words, he
   intended to express a repetition which is constant and unceasing, and
   full of annoyance. The metaphor, as I have already said, is taken from
   children, to whom teachers do not venture to give long lessons, because
   they are incapable of them, but give them, as it were, in little drops.
   Thus, they convey the same instructions a second and third time, and
   oftener; and, in short, they continue to receive elementary
   instructions till they acquire reason and judgment. By a witty
   imitation he repeats the words, "here a little, there a little."

   Instruction upon instruction. [221] The word qv (kav) is improperly, in
   my opinion, translated by some interpreters line, as if the Prophet
   alluded to the slow progress of a building, which rises gradually by
   "lines." That would be a harsh and far-fetched metaphor, for this
   passage relates to elementary instruction conveyed to children. I
   acknowledge that the same Hebrew word is used in the eighteenth
   chapter, where we have translated it "Line by line," [222] and in many
   other passages; but here the connection demands a different meaning, as
   is also the case in Psalm 19:4, where, however, the word line [223] or
   dimension could be admitted with greater propriety than in this verse.
   Yet I admit that it is taken metaphorically for an instruction or rule;
   for as in buildings qv (kav) denotes the "rule" or "plumb-line," as we
   shall see that it means in a later portion of this chapter, we need not
   wonder that it is applied to other rules.

   11. For with stammering lips. [224] Some supply, that "it is as if one
   should say;" but that is superfluous. I therefore view these words as
   relating to God, who became, as the Prophet tells us, a barbarian [225]
   to a people without understanding. This reproof must have wounded them
   to the quick, because by their own fault they made God, who formed our
   tongues, to appear to be "a stammerer." He does not as yet threaten
   them, but lays the blame on their indolence, that they rendered the
   proclamation of heavenly doctrine a confused noise, because of their
   own accord they shut their eyes, and thus derived no advantage from it.
   Their infatuation, in not hearing God speaking to them, is compared by
   the Prophet to a prodigy.

   12. For he said to them. Some explain it by circumlocution in this
   manner: "If one should say to them, This is the rest, they refuse to
   hear." But this is a feeble exposition, and does not connect the
   various parts of the passage in a proper manner. On the contrary, the
   Prophet assigns the reason why God appears to the Jews to be a
   barbarian: it is, because they had not ears. Words were spoken to the
   deaf. It was to no purpose that the Lord offered to them rest. This
   deafness arose from obstinacy, for they wickedly and rebelliously
   rejected doctrine. Their wickedness was doubly inexcusable in refusing
   rest which was offered to them, and which all men naturally desire. It
   was in itself intolerable baseness to be deaf to the voice of God
   speaking, but it was still more foul ingratitude deliberately to reject
   a blessing which was in the highest degree desirable. Accordingly, he
   points out the benefit which they might have derived from the obedience
   of faith, and of which they deprived themselves by their own
   wickedness. He therefore reproaches them with this ignorance and
   blindness; for it springs from their own stubbornness in maliciously
   turning away their eyes from the light which was offered to them, and
   choosing rather to remain in darkness than to be enlightened.

   Hence it follows that unbelievers, as soon as God has exhibited to them
   his word, voluntarily draw down on themselves wretched uneasiness; for
   he invites all men to a blessed rest, and clearly points out the object
   by which, if we shape the course of our life, true happiness awaits us;
   for no man who has heard heavenly doctrine can go astray except
   knowingly and willingly. We learn from it how lovely in our eyes
   heavenly doctrine ought to be, for it brings to us the invaluable
   blessing of enjoying peace of conscience and true happiness. All
   confess loudly that there is nothing better than to find a place of
   security; and yet, when rest is offered, many despise it, and the
   greater part of men even refuse it, as if all men expressly desired to
   have wretched perplexity and continual trembling: and yet no man has a
   right to complain that he errs through ignorance; for nothing is
   clearer or plainer than the doctrine of God, so that it is vain for men
   to plead any excuse. In short, nothing can be more unreasonable than to
   throw the blame on God, as if he spoke obscurely, or taught in a
   confused manner. Now, as God testifies in this passage that he points
   out to us in his word assured rest, so, on the other hand, he warns all
   unbelievers that they suffer the just reward of their wickedness when
   they are harassed by continual uneasiness.

   Cause the weary to rest. Some explain it thus, that God demands the
   duties of brotherly kindness, in order that he may be reconciled to us,
   and that those duties are here included, a part being taken for the
   whole. But I think that the Prophet's meaning is different, namely,
   that God points out to us that rest by which our weariness may be
   relieved, and that consequently we are convicted of deeper ingratitude,
   if even necessity, which is a very sharp spur, does not quicken us to
   seek a remedy. This saying of the Prophet corresponds nearly to the
   words of Christ,

   "Come to me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
   rest." (Matthew 11:28.)

   In a word, Isaiah informs the Jews that they have this choice, "Do they
   prefer to be refreshed and relieved, or to sink under the burden and be
   overwhelmed?" This confirms a passing remark which I made a little
   before, that God does not in vain exhort those who seek repose to come
   to him, as we shall elsewhere see,

   "I have not in vain said to the house of Jacob, Seek me." (Isaiah
   45:19.)

   Since, therefore, if we do not stand in the way, we shall be taught by
   his word, we may safely rely on the doctrine which is contained in it;
   for he does not intend to weary us out by vain curiosity, as men often
   draw down upon themselves much distress and anguish by idle pursuits.

   Besides, when he shews that this rest is prepared for the weary who
   groan under the burden, let us at least be taught by the distresses
   which harass us to betake ourselves to the word of God, that we may
   obtain peace. We shall thus find that the word of God is undoubtedly
   fitted to soothe our uneasy feelings, and to give peace to our
   perplexed and trembling consciences. All who seek "rest" in any other
   way, and run beyond the limits of the word, must always be subjected to
   torture or wretched uncertainty, because they attempt to be wise and
   happy without God. We see that this is the condition of the Papists,
   who, having despised this peace of God, are wretchedly tormented during
   their whole life; for Satan tosses and drives them about in such a
   manner that they are tormented with dreadful uneasiness, and never find
   a place of rest.

   13. The word of the Lord shall therefore be to them. Although the
   Prophet repeats the same words, yet the meaning is somewhat different;
   for, having formerly spoken of voluntary stupidity, he now threatens
   the punishment of it, namely, that God will strike them with such
   bewilderment, that they shall be totally deprived of the benefit of
   saving doctrine, and shall perceive in it nothing but an empty sound.
   In short, he concludes, from what goes before, that since they had not
   profited by the word of God, the Jews shall be justly punished for
   their ingratitude; not that the word shall be taken from them, but that
   they shall be deprived of sound judgment and understanding, and shall
   be blind amidst the clearest light. Thus God blinds and hardens the
   reprobate more and more on account of their disobedience.

   Paul quotes this passage (1 Corinthians 14:21) when he reproves the
   Corinthians for foolish affectation, in consequence of their being so
   much under the influence of ambition, that they regarded with the
   highest admiration those who spoke in a foreign tongue, as the common
   people are accustomed to stare at everything that is unknown and
   uncommon. This passage in the writings of Paul has been misunderstood,
   because these words of the Prophet have not been duly weighed. Now,
   Paul applies these words most appropriately to his object; for he shews
   that the Corinthians are under the influence of a foolish and absurd
   admiration, and that they improperly aspire to those things from which
   they can derive no advantage; in short, that they are "like children,
   not in malice, but in knowledge and understanding;" that thus they
   voluntarily draw down on themselves the curse which the Prophet here
   threatens; and that the word of God becomes to them precept on precept,
   and they receive no more instruction from it than if a person were to
   bawl out to them in an unknown tongue. It is the height of madness to
   bring upon themselves, by idle affectation, that blindness and
   stupidity which the Lord threatens against obstinate and rebellious
   men. Paul therefore explains and renders more intelligible this
   statement made by the Prophet, for he shews that they who abuse the
   doctrine of salvation do not deserve to make progress in it in any way
   whatever.

   We have seen a passage closely resembling it in which the Prophet
   compared his doctrine to "sealed letters." (Isaiah 8:16) Afterwards we
   shall find that the Prophet compares it to a book that is "shut."
   (Isaiah 29:11.) This takes place when, on account of the ingratitude of
   men, God takes from them judgment and sound understanding; so that,
   "seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear," and thus are
   most justly punished. (Isaiah 6:9; Mark 4:12.) This ought to be
   carefully observed; for frequently we think that all is well with us,
   and are highly delighted with ourselves, because we continue to enjoy
   the word. [226] But of what avail will it be to us, if it do not
   enlighten our understanding and regulate our hearts? We thus draw down
   upon ourselves a heavier judgment, and therefore we need a twofold
   grace; first, that God would shine on us by his word; and secondly,
   that he would open our understandings and dispose our hearts to
   obedience, otherwise we shall derive no more aid from the brilliancy of
   the gospel than blind men derive from the brightness of the sun. By
   this punishment, therefore, we are reminded that we must not abuse the
   word of God, but must look directly to the object which the Lord holds
   out to us in the word.

   They shall fall backward, and be broken and snared. At length he
   describes the destruction of those who are blind to this brightness of
   the word; for nothing remains for them but to be thrown down headlong,
   because they have departed from the right path, and therefore they must
   stumble and fall. He means that the fall will not be slight, for they
   shall be bruised by it. By the word snared he employs another metaphor,
   namely, that for all unbelievers "snares" are prepared, by which they
   shall be entangled and drawn to destruction. We had a similar sentiment
   on a former occasion, (Isaiah 8:15,) and expressed in nearly the same
   words; [227] for there the Prophet speaks on the same subject, the
   blinding of the people, who by their obstinacy had provoked the wrath
   of God. He shews that they who go astray, in opposition to the word of
   God, are always very near destruction. Either they shall meet with
   stumbling blocks on which they shall "stumble," or with snares by which
   they shall be "ensnared." In short, it will be impossible that evil
   shall not befall those who do not keep the path which God has pointed
   out; for either they shall openly "fall and be bruised," or through
   concealed traps they shall fall into a "snare."

   14. Wherefore hear ye the word of the Lord. He goes on to address to
   them still stronger reproof, and at the same time mingles with it a
   consolation in order to encourage the hearts of the godly. While he
   threatens utter destruction against the wicked, he leaves for believers
   ground of consolation, by declaring that their salvation is dear and
   precious in the sight of God.

   Ye scornful men. By this term he means men who are addicted to
   sophistry and deceit, who think that by jeers and cunning they can
   escape the judgment of God; for lvts (lutz) [228] signifies to jeer or
   scorn. Now, he addresses not ordinary men, but rulers and governors,
   who, in governing the people, thought that they surpassed other men in
   sharpness and dexterity, but turned their acuteness to cunning, by
   which they acted hypocritically towards God himself, and therefore, in
   keen irony, he calls them "scorners;" as if he had said,

   "You think that you have enough of craftiness to mock God,
   but you will not succeed in mocking him." (Galatians 6:7.)

   The Prophet's chief and severest contest was with the nobles; for
   although all ranks were exceedingly corrupted, yet the nobles, being
   puffed up with a false belief of their own wisdom, were more obstinate
   than the rest. It has commonly been found, in almost every age, that
   the common people, though they are distinguished by unrestrained
   fierceness and violence, do not proceed to such a pitch of wickedness
   as nobles or courtiers, or other crafty men, who think that they excel
   others in ability and wisdom. The ministers of the word ought chiefly,
   therefore, to arm themselves against ingenious adversaries. None can be
   more destructive; for they not only of themselves do injury, but excite
   others to the same kind of scorn and wickedness, and frequently,
   through the estimation in which they are held, and the splendor of
   their reputation, they dazzle the common people who are less
   clear-sighted. It is a dreadful and monstrous thing when the governors
   of the Church not only are themselves blinded, but even blind others,
   and excite them to despise God, and ridicule godly doctrine, and taunt
   it by their jeers, and, in short, employ their utmost ingenuity for
   overturning religion; but in opposition to such persons we ought to
   encourage our hearts by the example of the Prophet, that we may not
   sink or lose heart in this contest. He shews us also the way in which
   we ought to treat such persons. [229] We ought not to spend much time
   in teaching them, (for instruction would be of little use,) but must
   threaten them severely, and terrify them by the judgment of God.

   This people which is in Jerusalem. Their guilt is highly aggravated by
   the consideration that they inhabit the very sanctuary of God, and
   infect with their pollution God's chosen people.

   15. Because ye have said. The Prophet next assigns the reason why he
   called them "scorners;" it was because they had thrown off all fear of
   God. He likewise describes the manner in which they acted, by saying
   that they promised to themselves that they would escape punishment
   amidst all their crimes and enormities, and became the more daring,
   and, as if they had obtained greater liberty to pursue wicked courses,
   rushed forward without dread wherever their unruly passions carried
   them.

   We have struck a league with death, and with hell have we made a
   compact. This is what he means by the league into which they had
   entered with death and the grave; for by despising and boldly
   ridiculing all God's threatenings and chastisements, they thought that
   they were out of all danger. chzh (chOzEh) means what he had formerly
   expressed by vryt, (berith,) for it is a repetition of the same
   statement. Literally it signifies seeing, [230] and denotes what is
   conveyed by the French phrase, avoir intelligence, or by the English
   phrase, "to have a mutual understanding." There appears to be also an
   implied contrast between prophetic visions and that deceitful
   craftiness on which veterans in wicked arts value themselves.

   We have made lies our refuge. It is certain that those cunning men
   never broke out into such boasting as to utter those offensive words,
   for that would have been childish and absurd. [231] Besides, though
   they despised God and set at nought all his admonitions, they
   undoubtedly wished to be held in some estimation by the people, and
   would never have confessed that they "made lies their refuge;" but the
   Prophet looked at their feelings and aims, and not at their pretexts,
   and took into account their actions and dispositions, and not their
   words. Whoever, then, flatters himself and his vices, and fearlessly
   despises God's threatenings, declares that he has "entered into a
   league with death," which he does not at all dread, notwithstanding the
   Lord's threatenings.

   The Prophet, therefore, reproves in general that carnal presumption by
   which men are led to forgetfulness of the judgment of God, and
   willingly deceive themselves, as if they could escape the arm of God:
   but chiefly he attacks Lucianists [232] and censorious men, who place
   their wisdom in nothing else than in irreligious contempt of God; and
   the more eager they are to conceal their dishonor, the more earnestly
   does the Prophet expose them, as if he had dragged forth to the light,
   from a deep concealment, their cunning wiles, and as if he had said,
   "This is the dexterity, skill, and cunning of the wise men of this
   world, who are exposed on every hand to troubles and afflictions, and
   yet imagine that they are concealed and safe. They unquestionably
   deserve to seek salvation from falsehood, for they disregard God's
   salvation, and despise and ridicule him." Their tricks, and cunning,
   and imposture, are indeed concealed by them under plausible names, and
   they do not think that they are falsehoods; but the Prophet calls them
   by their proper names.

   When the overflowing scourge shall pass through. As to "the overflowing
   scourge," the Prophet here includes two metaphors; for he compares the
   calamities and afflictions by which God chastises the transgressions of
   the world to a "scourge," and then says, that they are so rapid and
   violent that they resemble a "flood." Against those calamities, however
   severe and distressing, wicked men of this description think that they
   are fortified by lying and deceit, and hope that they shall be able to
   escape them, though they overflow far and wide over the whole world.
   They perceive the judgments of God, and the calamities to which men are
   exposed; but, because they do not observe the hand and providence of
   God, and ascribe everything that happens to fortune, they therefore
   seek to obtain such defences and safeguards as may drive such
   "scourges" away from them.

   16. Therefore thus saith the Lord God. Isaiah now comforts the godly,
   and threatens against the wicked such punishment as they deserved. In
   the first instance, he brings forward consolation, because the godly
   were a laughingstock to those crafty men, as we see at the present day
   that irreligious men laugh at our simplicity, and reckon us to be
   fools, because amidst such deep adversity and sore afflictions we still
   hope that it will turn out to our advantage. In opposition to this
   insolence of the reprobate, the Prophet encourages and supports the
   hearts of the godly to pass by with indifference, and reckon of no
   account their jeers and reproaches, and to believe firmly that their
   hope will not be confounded or vain.

   Behold, I lay in Zion a stone, a stone of trial. The demonstrative
   particle behold expresses certainty; as if he had said, "Though wicked
   men despise my words, and refuse to believe them, yet I will perform
   what I have promised." The pronoun I is emphatic, that the prophecy may
   be more firmly believed. As to the words, the genitive vchn, (bOchan,)
   of trial, which is used instead of an adjective along with stone, may
   be taken both in an active and in a passive sense, either for a stone
   by which the whole building is "tried," or examined as by a standard,
   or for a "tried stone." The former meaning appears to me to be more
   appropriate, and undoubtedly the usage of the Hebrew language requires
   us to interpret it rather in an active sense. He calls it therefore a
   trying stone, or a trier, on account of the effect produced; because by
   this stone the whole building must be squared and adjusted, otherwise
   it must unavoidably totter and fall.

   A precious corner-stone, a sure foundation. He calls it a corner-stone,
   because it supports the whole weight of the building, and by this name,
   which is also given to it in Psalm 118:22, he commends its force and
   strength. Lastly, he calls it a "foundation," and, so to speak, a
   "fundamental foundation," proceeding gradually in the commendation of
   it; for he shews that it is not an ordinary stone, or one of many which
   contribute to the building, but that it is a highly valuable stone, on
   which the whole weight of the building exclusively rests. It is a
   stone, but a stone which fills the whole corner; it is a corner-stone,
   but the whole house is founded on it. As "another foundation cannot be
   laid," so on it alone must the whole Church, and every part of it, rest
   and be built. (1 Corinthians 3:11.)

   He that believeth shall not make haste. This clause is interpreted by
   some as an exhortation, "He that believeth, let him not make haste."
   But I prefer to take it in the future tense, both because that meaning
   agrees best with the context, and because it is supported by the
   authority of the Apostle Paul. I do acknowledge that the Apostles
   followed the Greek translation, [233] and used such liberty, that while
   they were satisfied with giving the meaning, they did not quote the
   exact words. Yet they never changed the meaning, but, taking care to
   have it properly applied, they gave the true and genuine
   interpretation. Whenever, therefore, they quote any passage from the
   Old Testament, they adhere closely to its object and design.

   Now, Paul, when he quotes this prophecy, adopts the Greek version, "He
   that believeth shall not be ashamed." (Romans 9:33; 10:11.) And
   certainly the design of the Prophet is to shew, that they who believe
   will have peace and serenity of mind, so that they shall not desire
   anything more, and shall not wander in uncertainty, or hasten to seek
   other remedies, but shall be fully satisfied with this alone. That is
   not a departure from the meaning, for the word signifying to make haste
   conveys the idea of eagerness or trembling. In short, the design of the
   Prophet is, to extol faith on account of this invaluable result, that
   by means of it we enjoy settled peace and composure. Hence it follows
   that, till we possess faith, we must have continual perplexity and
   distress; for there is but one harbour on which we can safely rely,
   namely, the truth of the Lord, which alone will give us peace and
   serenity of mind.

   This fruit of faith is elsewhere described by the same Apostle Paul,
   when he says that, "being justified by faith, we obtain peace with
   God." (Romans 5:1.) The Apostles and evangelists shew that this "stone"
   is Christ, because the Church was actually settled and founded at the
   time when he was presented to the view of the world. (Matthew 21:42;
   Acts 4:11; Romans 9:33; 1 Peter 2:6.) First, in him the promises have
   their firmness; secondly, the salvation of men rests on him alone, and
   therefore if Christ be taken away, the Church will fall down and be
   ruined. The state of the fact therefore shews, that these statements
   must undoubtedly be referred to Christ, without whom there is no
   certainty of salvation; and therefore at every moment ruin is at hand.
   Next, we have the authority of evangelists and Apostles; and indeed the
   Holy Spirit conveys that instruction by their mouth.

   But it will be proper to examine it more closely, that we may see in
   what manner these things are applied to Christ. First, it is not
   without good reason that Isaiah represents God as speaking, whose
   peculiar work it is to found the Church, as we have already seen
   elsewhere, and as the Prophet will afterwards declare; and this
   statement occurs very frequently in the Psalms. For if all men devote
   their labor to it, they will not be able to lay the least stone. It is
   God alone, therefore, who founds and builds his Church, though he
   employs for this purpose the labors and services of men. Now, by whom
   was Christ given, but by the Father? So then it was the heavenly Father
   who did and accomplished these things, and who appointed Christ to be
   the only foundation on which our salvation rests.

   But was not this stone laid before? Did not the Church always rest on
   this foundation? I acknowledge that it did, but only in hope; for
   Christ had not yet been revealed, and had not fulfilled the office of a
   Redeemer. On this account the Prophet speaks of it as a future event,
   that believers may be fully persuaded that the Church, which they saw
   not only tottering and falling, but grievously shaken and almost laid
   in ruins, will yet be made firm by a new support, when it shall rest on
   a stone laid by the hand of God.

   I lay in Zion. He says that it is "in Zion;" because Christ must come
   out of it, which contributes greatly to confirm our faith, when we see
   that he came out of that place which was appointed for this purpose so
   long before. Now, at the present day, "Mount Zion" is everywhere; for
   the Church has spread to the ends of the world.

   Christ is truly "the stone of trial," for by him must the whole
   building be regulated, and we cannot be the building of God, if we are
   not adapted to him. Hence also Paul exhorts us to

   "grow in him who is the head, from whom the whole body must be joined
   and united." (Ephesians 4:15.)

   Our faith must be wholly applied to Christ, that he may be our rule. He
   is also the "corner-stone," on which rests not only one part of the
   building, but its whole weight, and the foundation itself.

   "No man," as Paul says, "can lay any other foundation than Jesus
   Christ."
   (1 Corinthians 3:11.)

   This is the reason why, when the Lord promises by the mouth of Isaiah
   the restoration of his Church, he reminds us of the foundation; for it
   was wasted in such a manner that it resembled a ruin, and there was no
   way in which it could be restored but by Christ. As to Christ being
   called also the "stone of stumbling," this is accidental; for the fault
   lies on ungrateful men, who, having rejected him, find him to be
   altogether different from what he would have been to them. But on this
   subject we have spoken at 8:14. [234]

   17. And I will lay judgment to the line. The ruinous condition of the
   Church being such that believers hardly ventured to hope that it would
   be improved, he shews that God has in his hand the ready means of
   forming the Church entirely anew. As he lately mentioned a building, so
   now, by a different metaphor, he shews that there is no reason to fear
   that God will not at length finish the work of building which has been
   begun. Yet indirectly he reproves the pride and insolence of those who
   wished to be accounted pillars of the Church, while they were
   endeavoring, as far as lay in their power, to raze it to the
   foundation. Although, in consequence of an almost total extinction of
   the light of faith, and a frightful corruption of the worship of God,
   the state of the people was hideous, yet they boasted of their royal
   priesthood, in the same manner as we see the Papists at the present day
   shamelessly utter similar boasting, though lamentable confusion cries
   aloud that the form of the Church has utterly perished among them. For
   this reason the Prophet describes what will be the reformation of the
   Church.

   Judgment to the line, and righteousness to the measure or plummet. It
   is probable that qv, (kav,) a line, and msqlt, (mIshkOlEth,) a plummet,
   mean the same thing, as may be inferred with greater certainty from
   another passage:

   "I will stretch over Jerusalem the rope or line of Samaria, and the
   plummet of the house of Ahab." (2 Kings 21:13.)

   Yet I do not deny that he alludes to the examination of weights; but
   both metaphors are taken from buildings, in which the master-builders
   and masons try everything by a rule, in order to preserve a due
   proportion in every part. Thus it is said that the Lord administers
   equal judgment, when he restores the Church, in which otherwise
   everything is disordered and confused, as in a hideous ruin, when the
   ungodly are exalted and enjoy prosperity, while the godly are despised
   and sorrowful.

   He makes the same statement concerning "righteousness," that he will
   measure or try it by his weights, and will regulate everything by a
   rule; for by righteousness and judgment he means a proper and lawful
   administration of the Church, as contrasting with the masks and
   disguises boasted of by those who fear the title of Bishops. The
   meaning is, that this foundation is laid, not only that the Church may
   be commenced, but that it may be perfectly restored, to use a common
   phrase, "from top to bottom" (De fonds en comble.)

   The hail shall sweep away the reliance of falsehood. This second part
   of the metaphor denotes also a very exact equality. Nothing then will
   be wanting to the building, if Christ be laid for the foundation; and,
   on the other hand, if he be not there, all will be vanity and
   confusion. Now since there was no room for "judgment and
   righteousness," but by sweeping away the false confidences, he declares
   that they shall be all swept away, because the violence of God's anger
   shall cast down all loftiness, and the flood shall penetrate all the
   hiding-places of thoughtless indifference. He therefore threatens that
   hypocrites, with all their boasting, shall nevertheless perish, even
   though the Lord preserve the Church; for he does not speak of
   chastisements, as if the wicked would be corrected by them, because, on
   the contrary, they become hardened and more obstinate. The cleansing,
   therefore, he shews, will be such as to drag them forth from their
   hiding-places and strip them of false and empty confidence; for wicked
   men think that they are so thoroughly concealed by their falsehood and
   deceit, that they shall never feel strokes, and therefore they please
   and flatter themselves amidst their iniquities and crimes; but the
   waters will easily reach them; that is, the wrath of God, which shall
   rush down upon them like a deluge, will easily break through their
   lurking-places.

   18. And your covenant with death shall be disannulled. Formerly he
   directed his reproof against hypocrites, who obstinately mocked at God
   and all his threatenings; and he checked their thoughts in imagining
   that "they had made a covenant with death," (verse 15,) that is, in
   promising to themselves that all their transgressions would pass
   unpunished; as if by jeers and laughter they could escape the arm of
   God. He now threatens that, when they shall be fully aware that they
   must render an account to God, they shall be struck with fear and
   dread, whether they will or not; [235] for that state of ease and
   indifference into which they are sunk, arises from a kind of lethargy
   or drunkenness, which hinders them from perceiving the alarming nature
   of their disease; but the Lord will arouse them from their sleep,
   however profound, and will annul their imaginary compacts.

   In short, he means that that peace which the wicked enjoy, while they
   slumber in their sins, will not be perpetual; for they shall be
   compelled, even against their will, to acknowledge that God is their
   judge, and, when they shall wish to enjoy repose, and while they are
   careless and unprepared, they shall be suddenly seized and agitated by
   strange terrors and anguish of mind. Their case is similar to that of
   malefactors, who, if they have broken out of prison and escaped, mock
   their judges, and utter reproachful and forward and insolent language
   against them, but, when they see the officers of justice close at their
   heels, suddenly tremble, and find that all their joy is turned into
   mourning, and that their condition is far worse than if they had not
   broken out of prison. Thus the wicked enjoy some momentary gladness,
   which they obtain by forgetfulness of their guilt; but the Lord
   immediately lays his hand on them, and terrifies their consciences in
   such a manner that they can find no rest.

   19. From the time that it shall pass. He expresses more in this verse
   than in the preceding one; for he declares that the destruction of the
   reprobate is close at hand, though they promise to themselves
   everlasting happiness. Wicked men indeed perceive that they are liable
   to many calamities, but yet they flatter and stupefy themselves, and
   imagine that in this way they can ward off their calamities. They have
   in their mouth proverbs of this sort, "Let us not distress ourselves
   before the time: Let us enjoy the season while it lasts: Let us be
   cheerful, and not give ourselves uneasiness when we can avoid it." But
   he threatens that there hangs over their heads a hidden destruction,
   [236] and adds:

   It shall seize you every morning, and shall pass every day by day and
   night. By "every morning" is meant "quickly and continually;" for it is
   only when they feel distress that wicked men are touched with the fear
   of God. Frequently indeed they are afraid when there is no danger; but
   it is a blind terror, for they do not understand whence their alarm
   proceeds. While God threatens, they are unconcerned, because they do
   not acknowledge him to be their judge, and thus they have no serious
   thoughts about God till they feel his hand. When he again repeats "in
   the morning," and afterwards adds, "by day and by night," he means, as
   I have said, that the scourge will be constant and daily; that they may
   not persuade themselves that it will be a light calamity, or deceive
   themselves by the hope of any mitigation; for, while the wrath of God
   against believers is momentary, against unbelievers it is eternal, for
   it never ceases to pursue them to the end.

   Terror alone shall cause them to understand the report. [237] Here
   commentators differ. Jerome's translation is, "Terror shall give
   understanding to the report." But they come nearer to the meaning of
   the Prophet who give this interpretation, "The report alone shall make
   you understand," that is, "The men to whom the messenger shall come
   will be rendered obedient to God by the report alone." For my own part,
   I adopt a simpler view, though I do not choose to refute the
   expositions given by others. "It will come to pass that terror alone
   shall enable you to understand doctrine." As if he had said, "Hitherto
   I have not succeeded in my exhortations to you, but the Lord will find
   out a new method of instructing you, that is, chastisements and
   calamities, by which he will terrify you in such a manner that you
   shall know with whom you have to do." It is as if a grieved and
   sorrowful father were thus to remonstrate with a disobedient and
   incorrigible son, "Since you despise my advices, you must one day be
   taught by the executioner." [238]

   Thus Isaiah threatens wicked men, who mocked at all his threatenings,
   and tells them that they do not care for the assistance of prophets,
   but that one day they will actually know with what sincerity and truth
   they addressed them, and yet that it will be of no advantage to them,
   because knowledge so late will leave no room for repentance. We must
   "seek the Lord while there is time." (Isaiah 55:6.) Pharaoh was made no
   better by the chastisements which he received, (Exodus 8:15,) and Esau
   gained nothing by his tears, when he saw that he had been stripped of
   his birthright, (Genesis 27:38; Hebrews 12:17;) for they were not
   followed by any repentance or any amendment of life. By the word
   "terror" he shews how "dreadful it is to fall into the hands of the
   living God," (Hebrews 10:31,) and that they who despise his word are
   never allowed to pass unpunished. He employs the word smvh (shEmugnah)
   to denote what is heard, that is, doctrine.

   20. For the bed shall be short. By this metaphor he adorns the former
   statement; for he compares the reprobate, who are pressed down by the
   hand of God, to those who have concealed themselves in a "short and
   narrow bed," in which they can scarcely stretch their limbs or lift
   their head, and where, in short, instead of rest, they feel sharp
   pains. He means that the Jews will be shut up in such a manner that
   they shall be overwhelmed with the severity of their distresses, and
   that the "bed," which is given to man for rest, will be an instrument
   of torture.

   If they seek a "covering," he says that "it will be too short to wrap
   themselves in it," and that it is an addition to their former distress,
   that amidst those heavy calamities they will want all necessary
   comforts. He chose to express this by the metaphor of a "narrow
   covering," that they may know that their condition will be in the
   highest degree wretched; because the vengeance of God will pursue them
   on all sides, both above and below, so that they shall have no
   abatement or mitigation, and shall find no relief. The Lord employs
   these metaphors, in order to accommodate himself to our weakness;
   because otherwise we cannot understand how dreadful is the judgment of
   God. Hence therefore we learn how dreadful are the terrors which shake
   and confine wicked men, when the Lord pursues them; they search eagerly
   for places of concealment, and would willingly hide themselves in the
   center of the earth; but the Lord drags them forth to light, and
   confines and hems them in, so that they cannot move.

   21. For as in Mount Perazim. Since he speaks here of the reprobate, the
   Prophet holds out nothing but terrors and cruel punishment; for while
   the Lord deals kindly and gently with his children, he shews that he
   will be an object of terror to the reprobate. For this purpose he
   produces examples, in which the Lord displayed his arm in defense of
   his people, as when he routed the Philistines in the valley of Perazim,
   when David pursued them, (2 Samuel 5:20; 1 Chronicles 14:11,) and at
   another time, when the Amorites and other enemies were slain by the
   Israelites in the valley of Gibeon, with Joshua as their leader, to
   whom the Lord granted that the "sun and moon should stand still," that
   they might more easily pursue their enemies. (Joshua 10:10-14.)

   Shall Jehovah rise up. By the word "rise up" he points out the power of
   God, because we think that he is lazy and indolent, when he does not
   punish the reprobate. It is therefore said that he "rises up" or stands
   erect, when he openly exhibits to us proofs of his power, and such as
   especially manifest the great care which he takes of his Church.
   Although the manner was different, (for in ancient times he "rose up"
   in defense of his chosen people against foreigners, but now he
   threatens war against the Jews,) yet Isaiah skillfully applies these
   examples; for by driving out internal enemies God will promote the
   advantage of his Church not less than if he directed his strength and
   arms against foreigners. He would thus reckon them in the number of
   enemies, though they falsely boasted that they were his people.

   His strange work. [239] Some think that this "work" is called
   "strange," because nothing corresponds better to the nature of God than
   to be merciful and to pardon our sins; and that when he is angry, he
   acts against his will, and assumes a character that is foreign to him
   and that is contrary to his nature. By nature he is gentle,
   compassionate, patient, kind, slow to anger, as Scripture declares by
   many words and by a variety of expressions his infinite compassion.
   (Exodus 34:6; Psalm 103:8.) Others explain it to mean that the "work"
   is "strange," because formerly he was wont to defend his people, and
   that it is monstrous that he now proceeds to attack and exterminate
   them, as if they were enemies.

   For my own part, I consider "strange" to mean simply what is uncommon
   or wonderful; for this appellation is given to what is rare and unusual
   among men, and we know that they almost always view with astonishment
   whatever is new. It is as if he had said, "The Lord will punish you,
   and that not in a common or ordinary way, but in a way so amazing that
   at the sight or hearing of it, all shall be struck with horror." It is
   certain that all the works of God are so many proofs of his power, so
   that they ought justly to excite our admiration; but because, through
   constant habit and looking at them, they are despised by us, we think
   that he does nothing unless he adopt some extraordinary methods. On
   this account Isaiah quotes ancient examples, in order that we may know
   that, though to men this vengeance be new and amazing, yet to God it is
   far from being new, since for a long period he has given proofs of his
   power and ability not less remarkable than these. Yet I willingly admit
   that the Prophet contrasts the wicked Israelites with the Philistines
   and Canaanites, as if he had said, "The Lord formerly performed
   miracles when he wished to save his people; he will now perform them in
   order to destroy that people; for since the Israelites have
   degenerated, they shall feel the hand of God for their destruction
   which their fathers felt for their salvation."

   22. Now therefore. He again reminds those wicked men, whom he had
   formerly called "scorners," (verse 14,) that their cunning, and
   contempt, and jeers, and mockery, will avail them nothing, because all
   their ingenuity will be thwarted; and he exhorts them to repentance, if
   there still be any of them that are capable of being cured. For this
   reason he repeats the same threatenings, in order to arouse them.

   Lest your chains be more firmly fastened. He says that all that they
   will gain by resistance will be to draw themselves more firmly into
   their nets. Instead of "chains," there are some who render mvsrym
   (mOsErim) "chastisements;" but this does not agree with the context.
   The metaphor of "chains" is highly appropriate in this passage; for, as
   the fox which has fallen into a snare, fastens the knot more firmly by
   his attempts to extricate himself and escape, so wicked men by their
   disobedience entangle and fasten themselves more and more. They desire
   to escape the hand of God, and kick against the spur, like an unruly
   horse which bends all its strength to shake of its rider; but all that
   they accomplish by their obstinacy and stubbornness is to receive
   heavier and severer blows.

   Be ye not mockers. This shews us how we ought to deal with wicked men,
   when we see that they are altogether destitute of the fear of God. All
   that remains for us to do is, to warn them that their jeers and scorn
   will be attended by no success in resisting the vengeance of God which
   hangs over them. We are also reminded that we ought not to sport with
   God, since we see, as in a mirror, what has been the end of those who
   despised the warnings and threatenings of the prophets since the
   beginning of the world.

   For I have heard a consumption. That his prediction may be firmly
   believed, he declares that he brings nothing forward which God did not
   reveal. klh (chalah) sometimes signifies "perfection," and sometimes
   "consumption," as we formerly stated [240] (Isaiah 10:23.) Here it must
   denote "consumption," for the Prophet means nothing else than that God
   has determined speedily to destroy the whole earth by a general
   slaughter. This includes two things; first, that dreadful and grievous
   destruction is about to overtake the world, (unless it be thought
   better to limit the word "earth" to Judea, to which I do not object,)
   and, secondly, that the day is fixed and is not distant. The word
   hearing is here used to denote Revelation. He says that it has been
   made known to him; for, as the Lord determined to make use of the
   ministry of the prophets, so he revealed to them his secrets, that they
   might be, as it were, interpreters of them.

   Upon the whole earth. As if he had said, "The whole world abounds with
   shocking impiety, reprobate men have grown wanton in their wickedness,
   as if there would be no judgment of God; but throughout the whole
   world, or in every part of Judea, God will shew that he is judge and
   avenger, and not a corner of the earth will be exempted from troubles
   and calamities, because they have despised the word." Now, although
   these things were revealed in the age of Isaiah, yet they belong not
   less to other times, in which God shews that he is always like himself,
   and is wont to execute his judgments by the same method and rule. [241]

   23. Give ear and hear my voice. Isaiah makes use of a preface, as if he
   were about to speak of something important and very weighty; for we are
   not wont to demand attention from our hearers, unless when we are about
   to say what is very important. And yet he seems here to speak of common
   and ordinary subjects, as for example, about agriculture, sowing,
   thrashing, and such like operations. But the Prophet intended to direct
   the minds of his hearers to higher matters; for when he discourses
   about the judgments of God, and shews with what wisdom God governs the
   world, though wicked men think that everything moves by chance and at
   random, he intended to lay down and explain a difficult subject, in a
   plain style, by metaphors drawn from objects which are well known and
   understood. We often complain that God winks too much at the crimes of
   wicked men, because he does not immediately punish them agreeably to
   our wish; but the Prophet shews that God appoints nothing but what is
   just and proper.

   The design of this preface therefore is, that men may perceive their
   stupidity in carping at the judgments of God, and putting an
   unfavourable construction on them, while even in the ordinary course of
   nature they have a very bright mirror, in which they may see them
   plainly. There is an implied expostulation with men who shut their eyes
   amidst so clear light. He shews that they are dull and stupid in not
   understanding the works of God which are so manifest, and yet are so
   rash and daring that they presume to judge and censure what is hidden.
   In like manner Paul also, when speaking of the resurrection, pronounces
   that those who do not perceive the power of God in the seeds which are
   thrown into the earth are madmen.

   "Thou fool, that which thou sowest does not grow or vegetate till it
   has rotted."
   (1 Corinthians 15:36.)

   Thus Isaiah here declares that those who do not see the wisdom of God
   in things so obvious are stupid, and, in short, that men are blind and
   dull in beholding the works of God.

   24. Doth the ploughman plough every day [242] to sow? This passage is
   commonly explained as if the Lord reproached his people for
   ingratitude, because he had cultivated the field as a husbandman, and
   had spent on it all his care and industry, and yet did not reap such
   fruit as it ought to have yielded. Such is the interpretation given by
   the Jews, who have been followed also by the Greek and Latin
   commentators; but Isaiah's meaning was quite different. He connects
   this doctrine with his former statement, that the destruction of Judea,
   or of the whole world, had been revealed to him; and therefore he adds,
   that still God does not always display his hand, or constantly punish
   the wickedness of men; for he often appears as if he did not see it,
   and delays the punishment of it for a time. The Lord's forbearance and
   slowness to punish, which is thus manifested, is abused by wicked men
   for leading them to greater lengths in wickedness, as Solomon remarks
   that men are encouraged to commit wickedness by observing that

   "all things happen alike to the good and to the bad," (Ecclesiastes
   8:14,)

   that all the worst and basest men enjoy prosperity, while the godly are
   liable to distresses not less and even greater than those of other men.
   [243]

   In short, when the wicked perceive no difference in outward matters,
   they think either that there is no God, or that everything is governed
   by the blind violence of fortune. To such thoughts therefore Isaiah
   replies, "Do you not know that God has his seasons, and that he knows
   what he ought to do at the proper time?" If ploughmen do not "every
   day" cleave the earth or break the clods, this ought not to be
   attributed to their want of skill; for, on the contrary, their skill
   requires them to desist. [244] What would they gain by continually
   turning over the soil, but to weary themselves to no purpose, and
   prevent it from yielding any fruit? Thus God does not act with bustle
   or confusion, but knows the times and seasons for doing his work. [245]

   25. When he hath levelled its surface. He now speaks about sowing. The
   sower will not put into the earth as much as he can, nor will he throw
   it in at random, but will measure the ground, and give to it as much as
   is necessary; for otherwise the superfluous mass would rot, and not a
   single grain would take root.

   Wheat in measure, and barley measured. [246] He will not mix various
   seeds, but will allot one part of the field for "wheat," another for
   "vetches," and another for "cummin." He will do this in measure, for
   that I consider to be the proper interpretation of svrh (sOrah.) [247]
   It does not mean excellent or good; for he is speaking about
   measurement. Similar statements are made about reaping and thrashing;
   for all kinds of grain are not thrashed in the same manner. Wheat is
   thrashed with the wheel of a cart or wagon, vetches with a staff, and
   cummin with a thicker rod. He speaks according to the custom of the
   country. This mode of thrashing is unknown in any part of France,
   except Provence. [248] In short, he means that the manner of thrashing
   which is suitable to the grain does not apply equally to all. Besides,
   the husbandman is not constantly or incessantly employed in thrashing,
   but exercises moderation, that he may not bruise the grain.

   26. His God instructeth and teacheth him what is right. From whom did
   the husbandman learn these things but from God? If they are so well
   educated and taught in the smallest matters, what ought we to think of
   so great a teacher and instructor? Does he not know how to apply a
   fixed measure and equity to his works? Does he not see the time for
   executing his judgment; when he ought to cut down the people, and, as
   we may say, to harrow [249] them; when he ought to thrash; what
   strokes, what kind of chastisements he ought to inflict; in short, what
   is most suitable to each time and to each person? Will not he who
   appointed the universal order of nature regulate these things also by a
   just proportion? Are men so headstrong that they will venture to
   remonstrate with him, or to impugn his wisdom? The general meaning is,
   that we ought not to judge rashly, if God does not immediately punish
   the wickedness of men.

   This shews that we ought to restrain the presumption of men, who, even
   in the smallest matters, often fall into mistakes. If a person ignorant
   of agriculture should see a husbandman cutting fields with a plough,
   making furrows, breaking clods, driving oxen up and down and following
   their footsteps, he would perhaps laugh at it, imagining that it was
   childish sport; but that man would be justly blamed by the husbandman,
   and convicted of ignorance and rashness; for every person of great
   modesty will think that those things are not done idly or at random,
   though he does not know the reason. When the seed is committed to the
   ground, does it not appear to be lost? If ignorant men find fault with
   these things, as ignorance is often rash and presumptuous in judging,
   will not intelligent men justly blame and pronounce them to have been
   in the wrong? If this be the case, how shall the Lord deal with us, if
   we dare to find fault with his works which we do not understand?

   Let us therefore learn from this how carefully we ought to avoid this
   rashness, and with what modesty we ought to restrain ourselves from
   such thoughts. If we ought to act modestly towards men, and not to
   condemn rashly what exceeds our understanding or capacity, we ought to
   exercise much greater modesty towards God. When we consider therefore
   the various calamities with which the Church is afflicted, let us not
   complain that loose reins are given to the wicked, [250] and that
   consequently she is abandoned to her fate, or that all is over with
   her; but let us believe firmly, that the Lord will apply remedies at
   the proper time, and let us embrace with our whole heart his righteous
   judgments.

   If any person carefully examining those words shall infer from them
   that some are punished more speedily and others more slowly, and shall
   pronounce the meaning to be, that punishment is delayed, such a view is
   not merely probable, but is fully expressed by the Prophet. We draw
   from it a delightful consolation, that the Lord regulates his thrashing
   in such a manner that he does not crush or bruise his people. The
   wicked are indeed reduced by him to nothing and destroyed; but he
   chastises his own people, in order that, having been subdued and
   cleansed, they may be gathered into the barn.

   29. This also hath proceeded from Jehovah of hosts. This passage is
   explained by some, as if The Prophet had said that the science of
   agriculture proceeded from the Lord; but I consider it to be the
   application of what goes before. Having pointed out the wisdom of God,
   even in the smallest matters, he bids us, in like manner, raise our
   eyes to higher subjects, that we may learn to behold with greater
   reverence his wonderful and hidden judgments. A passing observation on
   the 26th verse may be made, and indeed ought to be made, that not only
   agriculture, but likewise all the arts which contribute to the
   advantage of mankind, are the gifts of God, and that all that belongs
   to skillful invention has been imparted by him to the minds of men. Men
   have no right to be proud on this account, or to arrogate to themselves
   the praise of invention, as we see that the ancients did, who, out of
   their ingratitude to God, ranked in the number of the gods those whom
   they considered to be the authors of any ingenious contrivance. Hence
   arose deification and that prodigious multitude of gods which the
   heathens framed in their own fancy. Hence arose the great Ceres, and
   Triptolemus, and Mercury, and innumerable others, celebrated by human
   tongues and by human writings. The Prophet shews that such arts ought
   to be ascribed to God, from whom they have been received, who alone is
   the inventor and teacher of them. If we ought to form such an opinion
   about agriculture and mechanical arts, what shall we think of the
   learned and exalted sciences, such as Medicine, Jurisprudence,
   Astronomy, Geometry, Logic, and such like? Shall we not much more
   consider them to have proceeded from God? Shall we not in them also
   behold and acknowledge his goodness, that his praise and glory may be
   celebrated both in the smallest and in the greatest affairs?

   CHAPTER 29
     __________________________________________________________________

   Isaiah 29:1-24

   1. Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye year to
   year; let them kill sacrifices.

   1. Heus Ariel, Ariel, urbs quam incoluit David. Addite annum ad annum,
   quibus jugulentur agni.

   2. Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow:
   and it shall be unto me as Ariel.

   2. Atqui in angustum redigam Ariel, et erit moeror et tristitia,
   eritque mihi tanquam Ariel.

   3. And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege against
   thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee.

   3. Et castrametabor adversum te in circuitu, et oppugnabo te in
   statione, et erigam contra te aggeres.

   4. And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground,
   and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, as
   of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech
   shall whisper out of the dust.

   4. Tum humiliaberis, e terra loqueris, et e pulvere exibit eloquium
   tuum, et erit quasi Pythonis e terra vox tua, et e pulvere eloquium
   tuum mussitabit.

   5. Moreover, the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust,
   and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth
   away; yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly.

   5. Et erit quasi pulvisculus sonitus extraneorum tuorum, et quasi
   stipula transiens multitudo fortium, et erit ad momentum repente.

   6. Thou shalt be visited of the Lord of hosts with thunder, and with
   earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of
   devouring fire.

   6. Ab Iehova exercituum visitaberis, in tonitru, et tumultu, et fragore
   magno, in turbine, et tempestate, et flamma ignis vorantis.

   7. And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even
   all that fight against her and her munition, and that distress her,
   shall be as a dream of a night-vision.

   7. Et erit quasi somnium visionis nocturnæ multitudo omnium gentium
   pugnantium adversus Ariel; omnis, inquam, pugnantis, et munitiones
   erigentis in eam, et constringentium eam.

   8. It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he
   eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty; or as when a thirsty man
   dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is
   faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the
   nations be that fight against mount Zion.

   8. Fiet ergo quemadmodum famelicus somniat, et ecce comedit; cum autem
   evigilat, inanis est anima ejus; et quemadmodum sitiens somniat, et
   ecce bibit; cum autem evigilat, lassus est, et anima ejus appetens; sic
   erit multitudo omnium gentium pugnantium adversus montem Sion.

   9. Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken,
   but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.

   9. Immoremini, et admiremini. Excæcati sunt et excæcant; ebrii sunt, et
   non vino; concussi sunt, et non sicera.

   10. For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and
   hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he
   covered.

   10. Quia obtexit super vos Iehova spiritu soporis, obstruxit oculos
   vestros: Prophetas vestros et præcipuos Videntes caligine obduxit.

   11. And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book
   that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read
   this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed.

   11. Itaque facta est vobis omnis visio quasi verba libri obsignati;
   quem si tradant scienti literas, ac dicant, Lege, quæso, in eo; tum
   dicet, Non possum, quia est obsignatus:

   12. And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read
   this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.

   12. Quod si detur ei liber qui non didicit literas, ac dicatur, Lege,
   quæso, in eo; tum dicet, Nescio literas.

   13. Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with
   their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their
   heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of
   men:

   13. Ergo dicit Dominus: propterea quod appropinquat populus iste ore
   suo, et labiis suis honorat me, ac cor suum longè a me removit, et fuit
   timor eorum erga me præcepto hominum doctus;

   14. Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among
   this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; for the wisdom of
   their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men
   shall be hid.

   14. Propterea ecce adjicio ut faciam rem mirandam in populo hoc,
   miraculum, inquam, et portentum; nam peribit sapienta sapientum ejus,
   et prudentia prudentum ejus evanescet.

   15. Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord,
   and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who
   knoweth us.

   15. Væ latitantibus ab Iehova, ut abscondant consilium; nam sunt in
   tenebris opera eorum, ac dicunt, Quis videt nos? et, Quis scit nos?

   16. Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the
   potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me
   not? Or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no
   understanding?

   16. Vestra concersio an sicut lutum figuli reputatur? nempe, dicit opus
   de auctore suo, Non fecit me; et figmentum de fictore suo, Non
   intellexit?

   17. Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into
   a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?

   17. Nonne adhuc paululum, paululum, et redigetur Libanus in Carmelum,
   et Carmelus in sylvam reputabitur.

   18. And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the
   eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.

   18. Et audient in die illa surdi verba libri, et de caligine et
   tenebris oculi cæcorum videbunt.

   19. The meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor
   among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

   19. Tunc repentent humiles in Iehova lætitiam, et pauperes hominum
   exultabunt in Sancto Israelis.

   20. For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is
   consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:

   20. Quoniam in nihilum redactus est violentus, contemptus est derisor;
   perierunt qui manè festinabant ad iniquitatem.

   21. That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him
   that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of
   nought.

   21. Facientes hominem peccare in verbo, qui arguentem in porta
   illaquearunt, et justum flexerunt ad nihilum.

   22. Therefor thus saith the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the
   house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face
   now wax pale.

   22. Propterea sic dicit Iehova ad domun Iacob, qui redemit Abraham: Non
   confundetur nunc Iacob, neque pallescet nunc facies ejus.

   23. But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the
   midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of
   Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.

   23. Nam ubi viderit natos suos, opus manuum mearum, in medio sui,
   sanctificabunt nomen meum, sanctificabunt Sanctum Iacob, Deum Israel
   timebunt.

   24. They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and
   they that murmured shall learn doctrine.

   24. Tum errantes spiritu discent intelligentiam; et murmuratores
   discent doctrinam.


   1. This appears to be another discourse, in which Isaiah threatens the
   city of Jerusalem. He calls it "Altar," [251] because the chief defense
   of the city was in the "Altar;" [252] for although the citizens relied
   on other bulwarks, of which they had great abundance, still they placed
   more reliance on the Temple (Jeremiah 7:4) and the altar than on the
   other defences. While they thought that they were invincible in power
   and resources, they considered their strongest and most invincible
   fortress to consist in their being defended by the protection of God.
   They concluded that God was with them, so long as they enjoyed the
   altar and the sacrifices. Some think that the temple is here called
   "Ariel," from the resemblance which it bore to the shape of a lion,
   being broader in front and narrower behind; but I think it better to
   take it simply as denoting "the Altar," since Ezekiel also (Ezekiel
   43:15) gives it this name. This prediction is indeed directed against
   the whole city, but we must look at the design of the Prophet; for he
   intended to strip the Jews of their foolish confidence in imagining
   that God would assist them, so long as the altar and the sacrifices
   could remain, in which they falsely gloried, and thought that they had
   fully discharged their duty, though their conduct was base and
   detestable.

   The city where David dwelt. He now proceeds to the city, which he
   dignifies with the commendation of its high rank, on the ground of
   having been formerly inhabited by David, but intending, by this
   admission, to scatter the smoke of their vanity. Some understand by it
   the lesser Jerusalem, that is, the inner city, which also was
   surrounded by a wall; for there was a sort of two-fold Jerusalem,
   because it had increased, and had extended its walls beyond where they
   originally stood; but I think that this passage must be understood to
   relate to the whole city. He mentions David, because they gloried in
   his name, and boasted that the blessing of God continually dwelt in his
   palace; for the Lord had promised that "the kingdom of David would be
   for ever." (2 Samuel 7:13; Psalm 89:37.)

   Hence we may infer how absurdly the Papists, in the present day,
   consider the Church to be bound to Peter's chair, as if God could
   nowhere find a habitation in the whole world but in the See of Rome. We
   do not now dispute whether Peter was Bishop of the Church of Rome or
   not; but though we should admit that this is fully proved, was any
   promise made to Rome such as was made to Jerusalem? "This is my rest
   for ever: here will I dwell, for I have chosen it." (Psalm 132:14.) And
   if even this were granted, do not we see what Isaiah declares about
   Jerusalem? That God is driven from it, when there is no room for
   doctrine, when the worship of God is corrupted. What then shall be said
   of Rome, which has no testimony? Can she boast of anything in
   preference to Jerusalem? If God pronounces a curse on the most holy
   city, which he had chosen in an especial manner, what must we say of
   the rest, who have overturned his holy laws and all godly institutions.

   Add year to year. This was added by the Prophet, because the Jews
   thought that they had escaped punishment, when any delay was granted to
   them. Wicked men think that God has made a truce with them, when they
   see no destruction close at hand; and therefore they promise to
   themselves unceasing prosperity, so long as the Lord permits them to
   enjoy peace and quietness. In opposition to this assurance of their
   safety the Prophet threatens that, though they continue to "offer
   sacrifices," [253] and though they renew them year by year, still the
   Lord will execute his vengeance. We ought to learn from this, that,
   when the Lord delays to punish and to take vengeance, we ought not, on
   that account, to seize the occasion for delaying our repentance; for
   although he spares and bears with us for a time, our sin is not
   therefore blotted out, nor have we any reason to promise that we shall
   make a truce with him. Let us not then abuse his patience, but let us
   be more eager to obtain pardon.

   2. But I will bring Ariel into distress. I think that v (vau) should
   here be taken for a disjunctive conjunction: "And yet I will execute my
   judgments and take vengeance, though, by delaying them for a time, it
   may seem as if I had forgiven." He next threatens that he will give
   them grief and mourning, instead of the joy of the festivals. 'nyh
   (aniah) is viewed by some as an adjective, [254] but improperly; for it
   is used in the same manner by Jeremiah. [255] (Lamentations 2:5.) He
   declares that the Lord will reduce that city to straits, that the Jews
   might know that they had to contend with God, and not with men, and
   that, though the war was carried on by the Assyrians, still they might
   perceive that God was their leader.

   And it shall be to me as Ariel. This clause would not apply to the
   Temple alone; for he means that everything shall be made bloody by the
   slaughter which shall take place at Jerusalem; [256] and therefore he
   compares it to an "Altar," on which victims of all kinds are slain, in
   the same manner as wicked men destined for slaughter are frequently
   compared to a sacrifice. In short, by alluding here to the word
   "Altar," he says, that the whole city shall be "as Ariel," because it
   shall overflow with the blood of the slain. Hence it is evident that
   the outward profession of worship, ceremonies, and the outward
   demonstrations of the favor of God, are of no avail, unless we
   sincerely obey him. By an ironical expression he tells hypocrites, (who
   with an impure heart present sacrifices of beasts to God, as if they
   were the offerings fitted to appease his anger,) that their labor is
   fruitless, and that, since they had profaned the Temple and the Altar,
   it was impossible to offer a proper sacrifice to God without slaying
   victims throughout the whole city, as if he had said, "There will be
   carnage in every part." He makes use of the word "Sacrifice"
   figuratively, to denote the violent slaughter of those who refused to
   offer themselves willingly to God.

   3. And I will camp against thee round about. By the word kdvr (kaddur)
   [257] he alludes to the roundness of a ball; and the expression
   corresponds to one commonly used, ("Je l'environneray,") "I shall
   surround it." Thus he shews that all means of escape will be cut off.

   And will lay siege against thee. This alludes to another method of
   invading the city; for either attacks are made at various points, or
   there is a regular siege. He confirms the doctrine of the former verse,
   and shews that this war will be carried on under God's direction, and
   that the Assyrians, though they are hurried on by their passions and by
   the lust of power, will undertake nothing but by the command of God. He
   reckoned it to be of great importance to carry full conviction to the
   minds of the Jews, that all the evils which befell them were sent by
   God, that they might thus be led to enter into an examination of their
   crimes. As this doctrine is often found in the Scriptures, it ought to
   be the more carefully impressed on our minds; for it is not without
   good reason that it is so frequently repeated and inculcated by the
   Holy Spirit.

   4. Then shalt thou be laid low. He describes scornfully that arrogance
   which led the Jews to despise all threatenings and admonitions, so long
   as they enjoyed prosperity, as is customary with all hypocrites. He
   says therefore, that, when their pride has been laid aside, they will
   afterwards be more submissive; not that they will change their
   dispositions, but because shame will restrain that wantonness in which
   they formerly indulged. We ought therefore to supply here an implied
   contrast. He addresses those who were puffed up by ambition, carried
   their heads high, and despised every one, as if they had not even been
   subject to God; for they ventured to curse and insult God himself, and
   to mock at his holy word. "This pride," says Isaiah, "shall be laid
   low, and this arrogance shall cease."

   And thy voice shall be out of the ground. [258] What he had formerly
   said he expresses more fully by a metaphor, that they will utter a low
   and confused noise as out of caverns. [259] The voice of those who
   formerly were so haughty and fierce is compared by him to the speech of
   soothsayers, who, in giving forth their oracles out of some deep and
   dark cave under ground, uttered some sort of confused muttering; for
   they did not speak articulately, but whispered. He declares that these
   boasters (alazones) shall resemble them. Some interpret this expression
   as if the Prophet meant that they will derive no benefit from the
   chastisement; but the words do not convey this meaning, and he
   afterwards says that the Jews will be brought to repentance. Yet he
   first strikes terror, in order to repress their insolence; for they
   arrogantly and rebelliously scorned all the threatenings of the
   Prophet. By their being "brought down," therefore, he means nothing
   else than that they shall be covered with disgrace, so that they will
   not dare to utter, as from a lofty place, their proud and idle
   boastings.

   5. And as the small dust. [260] I shall first state the opinions of
   others, and afterwards I shall bring forward what I consider to be more
   probable. Almost all the commentators think that this expression
   denotes the enemies of the Jews; for they consider "foreigners" to mean
   "enemies," and allege that the multitude of those who shall oppress the
   Jews shall be "like dust;" that is, it shall be innumerable. But when I
   examine closely the whole passage, I am more disposed to adopt a
   contrary opinion. I think that the Prophet speaks contemptuously of the
   garrisons on which the Jews foolishly relied, for they had in their pay
   foreign soldiers who were strong men.

   The multitude of the mighty ones. Such is the interpretation which I
   give to rytsym (gnaritzim), which is also its literal meaning; and I
   see no reason why some of the Jews should suppose it to mean ungodly or
   wicked persons. Since, therefore, the Jews brought various garrisons
   from a distance, they thought that they were well defended, and dreaded
   no danger. The Prophet threatens that their subsidiary troops, though
   they were a vast multitude, shall in vain create a disturbance, for
   they shall be like "dust" or "chaff," that is, useless refuse, for they
   shall produce no effect. [261] Hence we ought to infer, that our wealth
   and resources, however great they are, shall be reduced to nothing, as
   soon as the Lord shall determine to deal with us as he has a right to
   do. The assistance of men lasts indeed for a time; but when the Lord
   shall lift up his hand in earnest, their strength must crumble down,
   and they must become like chaff.

   And it shall be in a moment suddenly. Some explain the concluding
   clause of this verse to mean, that the noise of the enemies' attack
   shall spring up suddenly, and, as it were, in a moment. But I consider
   vhych, (vEhayah,) and it shall be, to relate to the time of duration,
   which he declares will be momentary; that is, those military aids shall
   not last long, but shall quickly vanish away. [262] In vain do men
   boast of them, for God is their enemy.

   6. From Jehovah of hosts shalt thou be visited. He next assigns the
   reason why all this multitude of garrisons shall be "like chaff;" and
   he expresses this by an opposite metaphor, for with those soldiers he
   contrasts the anger and "visitation of the Lord." What is "chaff" to
   the flame of "a devouring fire?" What is "dust" to the force and
   violence of a "whirlwind?" He shews that the vengeance of God will be
   such as all their preparations shall be unable to resist. This meaning,
   in my opinion, makes the passage to flow easily, and the clauses will
   not be so well adjusted, if we follow a different interpretation.

   Hence we learn that those who assail us can do no more than what the
   Lord permits them to do. If therefore the Lord determine to save us,
   the enemies will accomplish nothing, though they raise up the whole
   world against us. On the other hand, if he determine to chastise us, we
   shall not be able to ward off his wrath by any force or bulwarks, which
   shall quickly be thrown down as by a "whirlwind," and shall even be
   consumed as by "a flame."

   7. As a dream of a night-vision. This verse also I interpret
   differently from others; for they think that the Prophet intended to
   bring consolation to the godly. There is undoubtedly great plausibility
   in this view, and it contains an excellent doctrine, namely, that the
   enemies of the Church resemble "dreamers" in this respect, that the
   Lord disappoints their hopes, even when they think that they have
   almost gained their object. [263] But this interpretation does not
   appear to me to agree well with the text. Sometimes it happens that,
   when a sentence is beautiful, it attracts us to it, and causes us to
   steal away from the true meaning, so that we do not adhere closely to
   the context, or spend much time in investigating the author's meaning.
   Let us therefore inquire if this be the true meaning of the Prophet.

   Since he afterwards proceeds again to utter threatenings, I have no
   doubt that here he follows out the same subject, which otherwise would
   be improperly broken off by the present statement. He censures the
   Jews, and rebukes them for their obstinacy, in boldly despising God and
   all his threatenings. In short, by a most appropriate metaphor, he
   reproves them for their false confidence and presumption, when he
   threatens that the enemies shall arrive suddenly and unexpectedly,
   while the Jews shall imagine that they are enjoying profound peace, and
   are very far from all danger; and that the event shall be so sudden and
   unexpected, that it will appear to be "a dream." "Although then," says
   he, "thou indulgest the hope of uninterrupted repose, the Lord will
   quickly awake thee, and will drive away thy presumption."

   The Prophet says wittily, that the Jews are "dreaming," because, in
   consequence of being drowned in their pleasures, they neither see nor
   feel anything, but, amidst the dizzy whirl, stupidly fancy that they
   are happy. Hence he infers that the enemies will come, as in "a dream,"
   to strike terror into those who are asleep, as it frequently happens
   that a pleasant and delightful sleep is disturbed by frightful dreams.
   It follows from this, that the pleasures which have lulled them to
   sleep will be of no advantage to them; for, though they do not at all
   think of it, yet a tumult will arise suddenly. This might still have
   been somewhat obscure, if he had not explained the subject more fully
   in the following verse.

   8. It shall be therefore as when a hungry man dreameth. He compares the
   Jews to "hungry men," who are indeed asleep, but whose empty stomach
   craves for food; for it is natural for men to dream about food and
   entertainments when they are in want of them. Thus, while the Jews
   watched, they were like "hungry men." The Lord continually warned them
   by his prophets, and invited them to the divine feasts of the word; but
   they despised those feasts, and chose rather to take refuge wholly in
   their vices, and to fall asleep in them, than to partake fully of those
   sacred feasts. Accordingly, while they quieted their consciences, they
   imagined that they had abundance of all things, and that they were free
   from every inconvenience. Isaiah declares that they greatly resemble
   this "dream" and airy "vision;" for, when they have been aroused by a
   sudden calamity, they shall feel how empty and insubstantial those
   "dreams and visions" were, and how false and delusive was the opinion
   which they had formed that they enjoyed abundance. As "hungry men," who
   have had such dreams, are rendered more feeble by them, so the people,
   who had been falsely persuaded that everything was going on well with
   them, will endure much greater uneasiness than if they had never
   cherished in their minds such a thought, but, on the contrary, had been
   aware of their poverty and nakedness.

   So shall be the multitude. At first sight, the expression appears to be
   harsh, when he says, "The multitude of those who fight against Ariel
   shall be as a dream;" but it ought to be explained in this manner: --
   "When the Jews, through false hope, shall promise to themselves
   deliverance, as if the enemies would be driven far away, they shall
   quickly feel that they had been deceived; in the same manner as a
   person whom hunger leads to dream that he is feasting luxuriously, as
   soon as he awakes, feels that his hunger is keener than before." I see
   nothing here, therefore, that is fitted to yield consolation, for the
   Prophet pursues the same subject, and exclaims against the scorn and
   rebellion of the Jews, on whom the Prophet could make no impression by
   exhortation or threatenings. [264]

   9. Tarry and wonder. Isaiah follows out the same subject, and attacks
   more keenly the gross stupidity of the people. Instead of "tarry," some
   render the term, "Be amazed;" but the view which I prefer may be thus
   expressed: "Though they dwell much and long on this thought, yet it
   will end in nothing else than that, by long continued thought, their
   minds shall be amazed." In short, he means that the judgment of God
   will so completely overwhelm their minds, that though they torture
   themselves by thinking and reflecting, still they will be unable to
   find any outlet or conclusion.

   They are drunken, and not with wine. He now assigns the reason why
   fixed thought does not aid them in conquering their slowness of
   apprehension. It is, because they resemble drunkards. When, therefore,
   they neither see nor understand anything in the works of God, he shews
   that this is owing to their indolence and stupidity. A proof of this is
   given daily in many persons; for spiritual "drunkenness" engrosses and
   stupefies all their senses to such a degree, that they are blind to the
   plainest subjects; and, when God shews the brightest light of justice
   and equity, they are so completely dazzled, that their dim vision
   bewilders them more and more. This stupidity is a just punishment which
   the Lord inflicts on them on account of their unbelief.

   In order that we may apply this statement of the Prophet for our own
   use, it is proper to observe, that these words of the Prophet must not
   be understood to be commands, as if he enjoined them to stop and think
   longer; but, on the contrary, he mocks and reproves their stupidity, as
   we have already said. (Pensez y tant que vous voudrez, vous n'y
   entendres rien) "Think as much as you please about it, you will not at
   all understand it."

   They are blinded, and they blind. [265] He means, that they are
   destitute of judgment and understanding, and that consequently it is
   useless for them to contemplate these works of God; for as the
   brightness of the sun is of no avail to the toad, so a blinded
   understanding in vain does its utmost to comprehend the majestic works
   of God. When he says that "they are blinded," he means that by nature
   we are created so as to be endued with reason and understanding for
   contemplating the works of God; that our being "blinded" is, so to
   speak, an accidental fault, and that the drunkenness does not naturally
   belong to us, for it is owing to the ingratitude of men, which the Lord
   justly censures.

   They stagger. This "staggering" of the mind is contrasted by him with a
   calm and quiet exercise of reason; for he means that violence of the
   passions which agitates the mind, and causes it to waver and reel.

   10. Because Jehovah hath overpowered you with the spirit of slumber.
   For the purpose of shewing more clearly the source of this blindness,
   he attributes it to the judgment of God, who determined to punish in
   this manner the wickedness of the people. As it belongs to him to give
   eyes to see, and to enlighten minds by the spirit of judgment and
   understanding, so he alone deprives us of all light, when he sees that
   by a wicked and depraved hatred of the truth we of our own accord wish
   for darkness. Accordingly, when men are blind, and especially in things
   so plain and obvious, we perceive his righteous judgment.

   Your prophets and principal seers. [266] He adds, that the people are
   deprived of those aids and helps which ought to have imparted light to
   the understanding and given direction to others. [267] Such was the
   office of the prophets, whom he describes by both of these names,
   nvy'ym, (nebiim,) and chzym, (chOzim,) "prophets" and "seers." In
   short, he means not only that men who are endued with reason and
   understanding will be deprived of common sense, but that their teachers
   also, whose duty it was to enlighten others, will be altogether
   senseless so as not to know the road, and, being covered with the
   darkness of ignorance, will shamefully go astray, and will be so far
   from directing others that they will not even be able to guide
   themselves.

   11. Therefore every vision hath become to you. The Prophet expresses
   still more clearly what he had formerly said, that the blindness of the
   Jews will be so great that, though the Lord enlightens them by the
   clearest light of his word, they will understand nothing. Nor does he
   mean that this will happen to the common people alone, but even to the
   rulers and teachers, who ought to have been wiser than others, and to
   have held out an example to them. [268] In short, he means that this
   stupidity will pervade all ranks; for both "learned and unlearned," he
   declares, will be so dull and stupid as to be altogether dazzled by the
   word of God, and to see no more in it than in a "sealed letter." He
   makes the same statement, but in different words, which he had made in
   the former chapter, that the Lord will be to them as "precept upon
   precept, line upon line;" for they will always remain in the first
   rudiments, and will never arrive at solid doctrine. (Isaiah 28:13.)

   In the same sense he now shews that, from the highest to the lowest,
   they will derive no benefit from the word of God. He does not say that
   doctrine will be taken away, but that, though it be in their
   possession, they will not have reason and understanding. In two ways
   the Lord punishes the wickedness of men; for sometimes he takes away
   entirely the use of the word, and sometimes, when he leaves it, he
   takes away understanding, and blinds the minds of men, so that "seeing
   they do not see." (Isaiah 6:9.) First, therefore, he deprives them of
   reading, either by taking away the books through the tyranny of wicked
   men, as frequently happens, or by a false conviction of men, which
   leads them to think that the books were not delivered to be read
   universally by all. Secondly, although he allows them to handle and
   read the books, yet, because men abuse them, and are ungrateful, and do
   not look straight to the glory of God, they are blinded, and see no
   more than if not a single ray of the word had shone upon them. We must
   not boast, therefore, of the outward preaching of the word; for it will
   be of no avail unless it produce its fruit by enlightening our minds.
   It is as if he had said,

   "On account of that covenant which he made with your fathers, the Lord
   will leave to you the tables of that covenant; but they shall be to you
   a sealed letter,' for you shall learn nothing from them." (Deuteronomy
   4:20, 37; 7:6.)

   When we see that these things happened to the Jews, as Isaiah
   threatened, and when we take into view the condition of that people,
   which God had adopted and separated, it is impossible that we should
   not altogether tremble at such dreadful vengeance. Though they had been
   instructed both by the law and by the prophets, and had been
   enlightened by a light of surpassing brightness, yet they fell into
   frightful superstitions and shocking impiety; the worship of God was
   corrupted, all religion was scattered and overthrown, and they were
   rent and divided into various and monstrous sects. At length, when the
   Sadducees, the most wicked of them all, held the chief power, when all
   faith and all hope of a resurrection, and even of immortality, had been
   taken away, what, I ask, could they resemble but cattle or swine? for
   what is left to man if the hope of a blessed and eternal life be taken
   from him?

   And yet the Evangelists (Matthew 22:23; Mark 12:18; Luke 20:27; Acts
   23:8) plainly tell us that there were such persons when Christ came;
   for at that time these things were actually fulfilled, as they had been
   foretold by the Prophet, that we may know that these threatening were
   not thrown out at random or by chance, and that they did not fail of
   accomplishment, because at that time they were obstinately and
   rebelliously despised and scorned by wicked men. At that time,
   therefore, both their unbelief and their folly were clearly seen, when
   the true light was revealed to the whole world, that is, Christ, the
   only light of truth, the soul of the law, the end of all the prophets.
   At that time, I say, there was, in an especial manner, placed before
   the eyes of the Jews "that vail which was shadowed out in Moses,"
   (Exodus 34:30,) whom they could not look at on account of his excessive
   brightness; and it was actually fulfilled in Christ, to whom it
   belonged, as Paul tells us, to take away and destroy that vail. (2
   Corinthians 3:16.) Till now, therefore, the vail lies on their hearts
   when they read Moses; for they reject Christ, to whom Moses ought to be
   viewed as related. In that passage "Moses" must be viewed as denoting
   the law; and if it be referred to its end, that is, to Christ, that
   vail will be taken away.

   While we contemplate these judgments of God, let us also acknowledge,
   that he who was formerly the Judge is still the Judge, and that the
   same vengeance is prepared for those who shall refuse to lend their ear
   to his most holy warnings. When he expressly names the "learned and
   unlearned," [269] it ought to be observed, that we do not understand
   spiritual doctrine, in consequence of possessing an acute
   understanding, or having received a superior education in the schools.
   Learning did not prevent them from being blinded. We ought, therefore,
   to embrace the word sincerely and earnestly, if we wish to escape this
   vengeance, which is threatened not only against the ignorant but also
   against the "learned."

   13. Therefore the Lord saith. The Prophet shews that the Lord, in
   acting with such severity towards his people, will proceed on the most
   righteous grounds; though it was a severe and dreadful chastisement
   that their minds should be stupefied by the hand of God. [270] Now,
   since men are so fool-hardy and obstinate, that they do not hesitate to
   contend with him, as if he were unjustly severe, the Prophet shews that
   God has acted the part of a righteous judge, and that the blame lies
   wholly on men, who have provoked him by their baseness and wickedness.

   Because this people draweth near with their mouth. He shews that the
   people have deserved this punishment chiefly on account of their
   hypocrisy and superstitions. When he says that "they draw near with the
   mouth and the lips," he describes their hypocrisy. This is the
   interpretation which I give to ngs, (nagash,) and it appears to me to
   be the more probable reading, though some are of a different opinion.
   Some translate it, "to be compelled," and others, "to magnify
   themselves;" but the word contrasted with it, to remove, [271] which he
   afterwards employs, shews plainly that the true reading is that which
   is most generally received.

   And their fear toward me hath been taught by the precept of men. By
   these words he reproves their superstitious and idolatrous practices.
   These two things are almost always joined together; and not only so,
   but hypocrisy is never free from ungodliness or superstition; and, on
   the other hand, ungodliness or superstition is never free from
   hypocrisy. By the mouth and lips he means an outward profession, which
   belongs equally to the good and the bad; but they differ in this
   respect, that bad men have nothing but idle ostentation, and think that
   they have done all that is required, if they open their lips in honour
   of God; but good men, out of the deepest feeling of the heart, present
   themselves before God, and, while they yield their obedience, confess
   and acknowledge how far they are from a perfect discharge of their
   duty.

   Thus he makes use of a figure of speech, very frequent in Scripture, by
   which one part or class denotes the whole. He has selected a class
   exceedingly appropriate and suitable to the present subject, for it is
   chiefly by the tongue and the mouth that the appearance of piety is
   assumed. Isaiah therefore includes, also, the other parts by which
   hypocrites counterfeit and deceive, for in every way they are inclined
   to lies and falsehood. We ought not to seek a better expositor than
   Christ himself, who, in speaking of the washing of the hands, which the
   Pharisees regarded as a manifestation of holiness, and which they
   blamed the disciples for neglecting, in order to convict them of
   hypocrisy, says,

   "Well hath Isaiah prophesied of you, This people honoureth me with the
   lips, but their heart is far from me."
   (Matthew 15:7, 8.)

   With the "lips" and "mouth," therefore, the Prophet contrasts the
   "heart," the sincerity of which God enjoins and demands from us. If
   this be wanting, all our works, whatever brilliancy they possess, are
   rejected by him; for "he is a Spirit," and therefore chooses to be
   "worshipped" and adored by us "with the spirit" and the heart. (John
   4:24.) If we do not begin with this, all that men profess by outward
   gestures and attitudes will be empty display. We may easily conclude
   from this what value ought to be set on that worship which Papists
   think that they render to God, when they worship God by useless ringing
   of bells, mumbling, wax candles, incense, splendid dresses, and a
   thousand trifles of the same sort; for we see that God not only rejects
   them, but even holds them in abhorrence.

   On the second point, when God is worshipped by inventions of men, he
   condemns this "fear" as superstitious, though men endeavour to cloak it
   under a plausible pretence of religion, or devotion, or reverence. He
   assigns the reason, that it "hath been taught by men." I consider mlmdh
   (mElUmmadah) [272] to have a passive signification; for he means, that
   to make "the commandments of men," and not the word of God, the rule of
   worshipping him, is a subversion of all order. [273] But it is the will
   of the Lord, that our "fear," and the reverence with which we worship
   him, shall be regulated by the rule of his word; and he demands nothing
   so much as simple obedience, by which we shall conform ourselves and
   all our actions to the rule of the word, and not turn aside to the
   right hand or to the left.

   Hence it is sufficiently evident, that those who learn from "the
   inventions of men" how they should worship God, not only are manifestly
   foolish, but wear themselves out by destructive toil, because they do
   nothing else than provoke God's anger; for he could not testify more
   plainly than by the tremendous severity of this chastisement, how great
   is the abhorrence with which he regards false worship. The flesh
   reckons it to be improper that God should not only reckon as worthless,
   but even punish severely, the efforts of those who, through ignorance
   and error, weary themselves in attempts to appease God; but we ought
   not to wonder if he thus maintains his authority. Christ himself
   explains this passage, saying, "In vain do they worship me, teaching
   doctrines, the commandments of men." (Matthew 15:9.) Some have chosen
   to add a conjunction, "teaching doctrines and commandments of men," as
   if the meaning had not been sufficiently clear. But he evidently means
   something different, namely, that we act absurdly when we follow "the
   commandments of men" for our doctrine and rule of life.

   14. Therefore, behold, I add to do. [274] He threatens that he will
   punish by blinding not only the ignorant or the ordinary ranks, but
   those wise men who were held in admiration by the people. From this
   vengeance we may easily learn how hateful a vice hypocrisy is, and how
   greatly it is abhorred by God, as the Prophet spoke a little before
   about human inventions; for what kind of punishment is more dreadful
   than blindness of mind and stupidity? This indeed is not commonly
   perceived by men, nor are they aware of the greatness of this evil; but
   it is the greatest and most wretched of all.

   For the wisdom of their wise men shall perish. He does not speak of the
   common herd of men, but of their very leaders, who ought to have been
   like eyes. The common people in themselves are blind, like the other
   members of the body; and when the eyes are blinded, what shall become
   of the rest of the body? "If the light be darkness," as Christ says,
   "how great shall be the darkness!" This is added in order to place that
   vengeance in a more striking light.

   Hence also, we may infer how vain and foolish is the boasting of the
   Papists, who think that they have shut the mouths of all men, when they
   have brought forward the name of Bishops, or other titles of the same
   kind, such as Doctors, or Pastors, or the Apostolic See. They have
   perhaps a different kind of wisdom from that which was possessed by the
   Jews; but whence did they derive it? They pretend that it came from
   God; but we see that the Prophet does not speak of the wise men of the
   Chaldeans or Egyptians, but of the order of priesthood which God had
   appointed, of the teachers, and chief rulers, and ensign bearers, of
   the chosen people and of the only Church; for under this term "wise
   men," he includes all superior excellence and authority among the
   people.

   15. Woe to them that conceal themselves from Jehovah. The Prophet again
   exclaims against those wicked and profane despisers of God, whom he
   formerly called ltsym, (letzim,) "scorners," who think that they have
   no other way of being wise than to be skilful in mocking God. They
   regard religion as foolish simplicity, and hide themselves in their
   cunning, as in a labyrinth; and on this account they mock at warnings
   and threatenings, and, in short, at the whole doctrine of godliness.
   From this verse it is sufficiently evident that the pestilence, which
   afterwards spread more widely, prevailed even at that time in the
   world, namely, that hypocrites delighted in mocking inwardly at God,
   and in despising prophecies. The Prophet therefore exclaims against
   them, and calls them mmyqym, (magnamikim,) that is, "diggers," [275] as
   if they "dug" for themselves concealment and lurking-places, that by
   means of them they might deceive God.

   That they may hide counsel. This clause is added for the sake of
   exposition. Some interpret the beginning of this verse, as if the
   Prophet condemned that excessive curiosity by which some men, with
   excess of hardihood, search into the secret judgments of God. But that
   interpretation cannot be admitted; and the Prophet plainly shews to
   whom he refers, when he immediately adds the mockeries of those who
   thought that their wickedness was committed in a manner so secret and
   concealed, that they could not be detected. The "hiding of counsel"
   means nothing else than hardihood in wickedness, by which wicked men
   surround themselves with clouds, and obscure the light, that their
   inward baseness may not be seen. Hence arises that daring question --

   Who seeth us? For, although they professed to be worshippers of God,
   yet they thought that, by their sophistry, they had succeeded not only
   in refuting the prophets, but in overturning the judgment of God; not
   openly, indeed, for even wicked men wish to retain some semblance of
   religion, that they may more effectually deceive, but in their heart
   they acknowledge no God but the god which they have contrived. This
   craftiness, therefore, in which wicked men delight and flatter
   themselves, is compared by Isaiah to a hiding-place, or to coverings.
   They think that they are covered with a veil, so that not even God
   himself can see and punish their wickedness. As rulers are principally
   chargeable with this vice, it is chiefly to them, in my opinion, that
   the Prophet's reproof is directed; for they do not think that they have
   sufficient acuteness or dexterity, if they do not scoff at God, and
   despise his doctrine, and, in short, believe no more than what they
   choose. They do not venture to reject it altogether, or rather, they
   are constrained, against their will, to hold by some religion; but they
   do so only as far as they think that they can promote their own
   convenience, and are not moved by any fear of the true God.

   At the present day this wickedness has been abundantly manifested, and
   especially since the gospel was revealed. Under Popery men found it
   easy to transact with God, because the Pope had contrived a god who
   changed himself so as to suit the disposition of every individual.
   Every person had a different method of washing away his sins, and many
   kinds of worship for appeasing his deity. Consequently, none ought to
   wonder that wickedness was not seen at that time, for it was concealed
   by coverings of that sort; and when these had been taken away, men
   declared openly what they had formerly been. Yet not less common in our
   age is the disease which Isaiah bewailed in his nation; for men think
   that they can conceal themselves from God, when they have interposed
   their ingenious contrivances, as if "all things were not naked and open
   to his eyes," (Hebrews 4:13,) or as if any man could deceive or be
   concealed from him. For this reason he says, by way of explanation --

   For their works are in darkness. He assigns this as the cause of that
   foolish confidence by which ungodly men are intoxicated. Though they
   are surrounded by light, they are so slow of perception, that when they
   do not see it, they endeavour to flee from the presence of God. They
   even promise to themselves full escape from punishment, and commit sin
   with as much freedom as if they had been protected and fortified on all
   sides against God. Such is the import of their question, Who seeth us?
   Not that wicked men ventured openly to utter these words, as we have
   said, but because they thus spoke or thus thought in their hearts,
   which was manifested by their presumption and vain confidence. They
   abandoned themselves to all wickedness, and despised all warnings, in
   such a manner as if there would never be a judgment of God. The
   Prophet, therefore, had to do with ungodly men, who in appearance and
   name professed to have some knowledge of God, but in reality denied
   him, and were very bitter enemies of pure doctrine. Now, this is
   nothing else than to affirm that God is not a Judge, and to cast him
   down from his seat and tribunal; for God cannot be acknowledged without
   doctrine; and where that is set aside and rejected, God himself must be
   set aside and rejected.

   16. Is your turning reckoned like potter's clay! There are various ways
   of explaining this verse, and, indeed, there is some difficulty on
   account of the two particles, 'm (Im) and ky (ki). 'm (Im) is often
   used in putting a question, and sometimes in making an affirmation; and
   therefore some translate it truly. The word hphk (haphach) is
   considered by some to mean "turning upside down," [276] as if he had
   said, "Shall your turning upside down be reckoned like clay?" Others
   render it "turning," that is, the purposes which are formed in the
   heart. But the most generally received rendering is, "turning upside
   down" or "destruction." As if he had said, "I would care no more about
   destroying you, than the potter would care about turning the clay; for
   you are like clay, because I have created you with my hand."

   But as the Prophet appears to contrast those two particles 'm (Im) and
   ky (ki), I am more inclined to a different opinion, though I do not
   object to the former exposition, which contains a doctrine in other
   respects useful. My view of it therefore is this, "Shall your turning,
   that is, the purposes which you ponder in your heart, be like potter's
   clay? Is it not as if the vessel said to the potter, Thou hast not
   formed me? Your pride is astonishing; for you act as if you had created
   yourselves, and as if you had everything in your own power. I had a
   right to appoint whatever I thought fit. When you dare to assume such
   power and authority, you are too little acquainted with your condition,
   and you do not know that you are men." [277]

   This diversity of expositions makes no difference as to the Prophet's
   meaning, who had no other object in view than to confirm the doctrine
   taught in the preceding verse; for he still exclaims against proud men,
   who claim so much power to themselves that they cannot endure the
   authority of God, and entertain a false opinion about themselves, which
   leads them to despise all exhortations, as if they had been gods. Thus
   do they deny that God has created them; for whatever men claim for
   themselves, they take from God, and deprive him of the honour which is
   due to him.

   Only in the first clause would the meaning at all differ; for those who
   interpret 'm (Im) affirmatively, consider this verse to mean, "Truly, I
   will destroy you as a potter would break the pot which he had made."
   But as the Prophet had to do with proud men, who sought out
   lurking-places in order to deceive God, I rather view it as a question,
   "Are you so able workmen that the revolutions of your brain can make
   this or that, as a potter, by turning the wheel, frames vessels at his
   pleasure?" Let every person adopt his own opinion: I follow that which
   I consider to be probable.

   17. Is it not yet a little while? The Lord now declares that he will
   make those wicked men to know who they are; as if he had said, "You are
   now asleep in your pride, but I shall speedily awake you." Men indulge
   themselves, till they feel the powerful hand of God; and therefore the
   Prophet threatens that the judgment of God will overtake such profound
   indifference.

   And Lebanon shall be turned into Carmel. [278] Under the names
   "Lebanon" and "Carmel" he intended to express a renovation of the world
   and a change of affairs. But as to the object of the allusion,
   commentators differ widely from each other. As Mount "Lebanon" was
   clothed with trees and forests, and "Carmel" had fruitful and fertile
   fields. Many think that the Jews are compared to "Carmel," because they
   will be barren, and Christians to "Lebanon," because they will yield a
   great abundance of fruits. That opinion is certainly plausible, as men
   are usually gratified by everything that is ingenious; but a parallel
   passage, which we shall afterwards see, (Isaiah 32:15), will shew that
   the Prophet here employs the comparison for the purpose of magnifying
   the grace of God; for, when he shall again begin to bless his people,
   the vast abundance of all blessings will take away from "Carmel" the
   celebrity which it possessed. He therefore threatens that he will turn
   "Lebanon" into "Carmel," that is, a forest will become a cultivated
   field, and will produce corn, and the cultivated fields shall yield so
   great an abundance of fruits that, if their present and future
   conditions be compared, they may now be pronounced to be unfruitful and
   barren. This mode of expression will be more fully explained when we
   come to consider Isaiah 32:15

   Others view "Carmel" as an appellative, but I prefer to regard it as a
   proper name; for it means that those fruitful fields may now be
   reckoned uncultivated and barren, in comparison of the new and unwonted
   fertility. Others explain it allegorically, and take "Lebanon" as
   denoting proud men, and "Carmel" as denoting mean and ordinary persons.
   This may be thought to be acute and ingenious, but I choose rather to
   follow that more simple interpretation which I have already stated.
   That the godly may not be discouraged, he passes from threatenings to
   proclaim grace, and declares that when, by enduring for a little the
   cross laid on them, they shall have given evidence of the obedience of
   their faith, a sudden renovation is at hand to fill them with joy. And
   yet, by shutting out the ungodly from this hope, he intimates that,
   when they are at ease, and promise to themselves peace or a truce,
   destruction is very near at hand; for, "when they shall say, Peace and
   Safety," as Paul tells us, "then sudden destruction will overtake
   them." (1 Thessalonians 5:3.)

   18. And in that day shall the deaf hear. He promises that the Church of
   God, as we have said, shall still be preserved amidst those calamities.
   Though the world be shaken by innumerable tempests, and tossed up and
   down, and though heaven and earth shall mingle, yet the Lord will
   preserve the multitude of the godly, and will raise up his Church, as
   it were, out of the midst of death. This ought to strengthen in no
   ordinary manner the faith of the godly; for it is an extraordinary
   miracle of God that, amidst the numerous and extensive ruins of empires
   and monarchies, which happen here and there, the seed of the godly is
   preserved, among whom the same religion, the same worship of God, the
   same faith, and the same method of salvation, are continued.

   And the eyes of the blind shall see. But Isaiah appears here to
   contradict himself; for formerly he foretold that among the people of
   God there would be so great stupidity that nobody would understand, and
   now he says that even "the deaf" shall understand, and "the blind shall
   see." He therefore means that the Church must first be chastised and
   purified, and that not in a common and ordinary way, but in a way so
   unusual that it will appear to have altogether perished. He therefore
   says, in that day, that is, after having punished the wicked and
   purified his Church, not only will he enrich the earth with an
   abundance of fruits, but, by renewing the face of it, he will at the
   same time restore "hearing to the deaf" and "sight to the blind," that
   they may receive his doctrine. Men have no ears and no eyes, so long as
   this dreadful punishment lasts; the minds of all are stupefied and
   confounded, and do not understand anything. When the plagues and
   distresses shall have come to an end, the Lord will open his eyes, that
   they may behold and embrace his goodness and compassion.

   This is the true method of restoring the Church, when it gives sight to
   the blind and hearing to the deaf, which we see that Christ also did,
   not only to the bodies but also to the souls. (John 9:7,39.) We too
   have experienced this in our own time, when we have been brought out of
   the darkness of ignorance, in which we were enveloped, and have been
   restored to the true light; and eyes have been restored to see, and
   ears to hear it, which formerly were shut and closed; for the Lord
   "pierced them," (Psalm 40:6,) that he might bring us to obey him. The
   blessing which he promised in the renovation of the earth was indeed a
   kind of proof of reconciliation; but far more excellent is that
   illumination of which he now speaks, without which all God's benefits
   not only are lost, but are turned to our destruction. Justly does God
   claim for himself a work so glorious and excellent; because there is
   nothing for which there is less ground of hope than that the blind
   should recover sight, and that the deaf should recover hearing, by
   their own strength. This is evidently promised, in a peculiar manner,
   to the elect alone; for the greater part of men always continue in
   their darkness.

   19. Then shall the humble again take joy in Jehovah. Such is my
   translation of this passage, while others render it, "They shall add,"
   or "continue to rejoice;" for the Prophet describes not a "joy" which
   is continued but rather a "joy" which is new. As if he had said,
   "Though they are now distressed and sorrowful, yet I will give them
   occasion of gladness, so that they shall again be filled with "joy." He
   speaks of the "humble;" and hence it ought to be observed that our
   afflictions prepare us for receiving the grace of God; for the Lord
   casts us down and afflicts us, that he may afterwards raise us up.
   Thus, when the Lord corrects his people, we ought not to lose heart,
   but should recall to remembrance those statements, that we may always
   hope for better things, and may believe that, after such calamities and
   distresses, he will at length bring joy to his Church. Yet we again
   learn from it what I briefly mentioned a little before, that the grace
   of illumination does not belong indiscriminately to all; for, although
   all have been chastened together, yet not all have had their hearts
   subdued by affliction, so as truly to become "poor in spirit," or
   "meek." (Matthew 5:3, 5.)

   20. For the violent man is brought to nought. He states more clearly
   what we have already mentioned in the former verse, namely, that the
   restoration of the Church consists in this, that the Lord raises up
   those who are cast down, and has compassion on the poor. But that
   purification of the Church, of which we have already spoken, is first
   necessary; for so long as the Lord does not execute his judgment
   against the wicked, and the bad are mixed with the good, so as even to
   hold the highest place in the Church, everything is soiled and
   corrupted, God is not worshipped or feared, and even godliness is
   trampled under feet. When therefore the ungodly are removed or subdued,
   the Church is restored to its splendour, and the godly, freed from
   distresses and calamities, leap for joy.

   First, he calls them rytsym, (gnaritzim,) "violent." There are various
   interpretations of this word; but I think that the Prophet
   distinguishes between those who are openly wicked, and have no shame,
   [279] and those who have some appearance of goodness, and yet are not
   better than others, for they mock at God in their hearts. But perhaps
   by the two adjectives, "violent" and "scorners," he describes the same
   persons; because, like robbers among men, they seize, oppress, treat
   with cruelty, and commit every kind of outrage, and yet are not
   withheld by any fear of God, because they regard religion as a fable.

   And they who hastened early to iniquity. [280] Under this class he
   includes other crimes. He speaks not of the Chaldeans or Assyrians, but
   of those who wished to be reckoned in the number of the godly, and
   boasted of being the seed of Abraham.

   21. That make a man an offender for a word. We have formerly stated who
   were the persons with whom the Prophet had to do, namely, with
   hypocrites and profane scorners, who set at nought all the reproofs and
   threatenings of the Prophets, and who wished to frame a God according
   to their own fancy. Such persons, desiring to have unbounded license,
   that they might indulge freely in their pleasures and their crimes,
   bore very impatiently the keen reproofs of the prophets, and did not
   calmly submit to be restrained. On this account they carefully observed
   and watched for their words, that they might take them by surprise, or
   give a false construction. I have no doubt that he reproves wicked men,
   who complained of the liberty used by the prophets, and of the keenness
   of their reproofs, as if they had intended to attack the people, and
   the nobles, and the priests; for hence arise the calumnies and false
   accusations which are brought even against the faithful servants of
   God. Hence arise those doubtful and ensnaring questions which are
   spread out as snares and nets, that they may either bring a righteous
   man into danger of his life, or may practice some kind of deceit upon
   him. We see that the Pharisees and Sadducees did so to Christ himself.
   (Matthew 21:23; 22:17; John 8:6.)

   Who have laid a snare for him that reproveth in the gate. This latter
   clause, which is added for the sake of exposition, does not allow us to
   interpret the verse as referring generally to calumnies, and other arts
   by which cunning men entrap the unwary; for now the Prophet condemns
   more openly those wicked contrivances by which ungodly men endeavor to
   escape all censure and reproof. As it was "in the gates" that public
   assemblies and courts of justice were held, and great crowds assembled
   there, the prophets publicly reproved all, and did not spare even the
   judges; for at that time the government was in the hands of men whom it
   was necessary to admonish and reprove sharply. Instead of repenting, as
   they ought to have done when they were warned, they became worse, and
   were enraged against the prophets, and laid snares for them; for "they
   hated," as Amos says, "him that reproveth in the gate, and abhorred him
   that speaketh uprightly." (Amos 5:10.) This relates to all, but
   principally to judges, and those who hold the reins of government, who
   take it worse, and are more highly displeased that they should receive
   such reproofs; for they wish to be distinguished from the rank of other
   men, and to be reckoned the most excellent of all, even though they be
   the most wicked.

   Who have laid snares. Commentators differ as to the meaning of the
   word! yqsvn, (yEkOshun;) for some render it "have reproved," and others
   "have reproached," as if the Prophet censured the obstinacy of those
   who resort to slanders, in order to drive reprovers far away from them.
   But I trust that my readers will approve of the meaning which I have
   followed.

   And have turned aside the righteous man for nothing, that is, when
   there is no cause. [281] By wicked and deceitful contrivances, they
   endeavor to cause the righteous to be hated and abhorred by all men,
   and to be reckoned the most wicked of all; but, after having thus
   sported with the world, they will at length perish. Such is the
   consolation which the Lord gives, that he will not suffer the
   wickedness of the ungodly to pass unpunished, though they give way to
   mirth and wantonness for a time, but will at length restrain them. Yet
   "we have need of patience, that we may wait for the fulfillment of
   these promises." (Hebrews 10:36.)

   22. Therefore thus saith Jehovah. This is the conclusion of the former
   statement; for he comforts the people, that they may not despair in
   that wretched and miserable condition to which they shall be reduced.
   We ought to observe the time to which those things must relate, that
   is, when the people have been brought into a state of slavery, the
   temple overturned, the sacrifices taken away, and when it might be
   thought that all religion had fallen down, and that there was no hope
   of deliverance. The minds of believers must therefore have been
   supported by this prediction, that, when they were shipwrecked, they
   might still have this plank left, which they might seize firmly, and by
   which they might be brought into the harbour. We too ought to take hold
   of these promises, even in the most desperate circumstances, and to
   rely on them with our whole heart.

   To the house of Jacob. The address made to them should lead us to
   remark, that the power of the word of God is perpetual, and is so
   efficacious that it exerts its power, so long as there is a people that
   fears and worships him. There are always some whom the Lord reserves
   for himself, and he does not allow the seed of the godly to perish.
   Since the Lord hath spoken, if we believe his word, we shall
   undoubtedly derive benefit from it. His truth is firm, and therefore,
   if we rely on him, we shall never want consolation.

   Who redeemed Abraham. Not without good reason does he add, that he who
   now declares that he will be kind to the children of Jacob is the same
   God "who redeemed Abraham." He recalls the attention of the people to
   the very beginning of the Church, that they may behold the power of
   God, which had formerly been made known by proofs so numerous and so
   striking that it ought no longer to be doubted. If they gloried in the
   name of Abraham, they ought to consider whence it was that the Lord
   first delivered him, that is, from the service of idols, which both he
   and his fathers had worshipped. (Genesis 11:31; 12:1; Joshua 24:2.) But
   on many other occasions he "redeemed" him; when he was in danger in
   Egypt on account of his wife, (Genesis 12:17,) and again in Gerar,
   (Genesis 20:14,) and again when he subdued kings, (Genesis 14:16,) and
   likewise when he received offspring after being past having children.
   (Genesis 21:2, 5.) Although the Prophet has chiefly in view the
   adoption of God, when the Lord commanded him to leave "his father's
   house," (Genesis 12:1,) yet under the word "redeemed" he includes
   likewise all blessings; for we see that Abraham was "redeemed" on more
   than one occasion, that is, he was rescued from very great dangers and
   from the risk of his life.

   Now, if the Lord raised up from Abraham alone, and at a time when he
   had no children, a Church which he should afterwards preserve, will he
   not protect it for ever, even when men shall think that it has
   perished? What happened? When Christ came, how wretched was the
   dispersion, and how numerous and powerful were the enemies that opposed
   him! Yet, in spite of them all, his kingdom was raised up and
   established, the Church flourished, and drew universal admiration. No
   one therefore ought to doubt that the Lord exerts his power whenever it
   is necessary, and defends his Church against enemies, and restores her.

   Jacob shall not now be ashamed. He means that it often happens that
   good men are constrained by shame to hang down their heads, as Jeremiah
   declares in these words, "I will lay my mouth in the dust."
   (Lamentations 3:29.) Micah also says, "It is time that wise men should
   hide their mouth in the dust." (Micah 7:16.) [282] For when the Lord
   chastises his people so severely, good men must be "ashamed." Now, the
   Prophet declares that this state of things will not always last. We
   ought not to despair therefore in adversity. Though wicked men jeer and
   cast upon us every kind of reproaches, yet the Lord will at length free
   us from shame and disgrace. At the same time, however, the Prophet
   gives warning that this favor does not belong to proud or obstinate
   persons who refuse to bend their neck to God's chastisements, but only
   to the humble, whom shame constrains to hang down their heads, and to
   walk sorrowful and downcast.

   It may be asked, Why does he say, "Jacob shall not be ashamed?" For
   "Jacob" had been long dead, and it might be thought that he ascribed
   feeling to the dead, and supposed them to be capable of knowing our
   affairs. [283] Hence also the Papists think that the dead are
   spectators of our actions. But the present instance is a
   personification, such as we frequently find in Scripture. In the same
   manner also Jeremiah says,

   "In Ramah was heard the voice of Rachel bewailing her children, and
   refusing to be comforted, because they are not;"

   for he describes the defeat of the tribe of Benjamin by the wailing of
   "Rachel," who was their remote ancestor. (Jeremiah 31:15.)

   Isaiah introduces Jacob as moved with shame on account of the enormous
   crimes of his posterity; for Solomon tells us that "a wise son is the
   glory of his father and a foolish son brings grief and sorrow to his
   mother." (Proverbs 10:1.) Though mothers bear much, still they blush on
   account of the wicked actions of their children. What then shall be the
   case with fathers, whose affection for their children is less
   accompanied by foolish indulgence, and aims chiefly at training them to
   good and upright conduct? Do they not on that account feel keener
   anguish, when their children act wickedly and disgracefully? But here
   the Prophet intended to pierce the hearts of the people and wound them
   to the quick, by holding out to them their own patriarch, on whom God
   bestowed blessings so numerous and so great, but who is now dishonored
   by his posterity; so that if he had been present, he would have been
   compelled to blush deeply on their account. He therefore accuses the
   people of ingratitude, in bringing disgrace on their fathers whom they
   ought to have honored.

   23. Because, when he shall see his children. The particle ky (ki) is
   here used in its natural and original meaning of for or because. The
   Prophet assigns the reason why the disgrace of Israel shall be taken
   away. It is, because he will have children, and those who were thought
   to have perished will be still alive.

   The work of my hands in the midst of him. By giving them this name, he
   intended, I have no doubt, to describe the astonishing work of
   redemption; for those whom God adopts to be his children, and receives
   into fellowship with himself, are made by him, as it were, new men,
   agreeably to that saying,

   "And the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord." (Psalm
   102:18.)

   In that passage the Psalmist describes in a similar manner the renewal
   of the Church; for this description, as we have repeatedly stated on
   former occasions, does not relate to the general creation which extends
   to all, but leads us to acknowledge his power, that we may not judge of
   the salvation of the Church by the present appearances of things. And
   here we ought to observe various contrasts; first, between the ruinous
   condition of the Church and her surpassing beauty, between her shame
   and her glory; secondly, between the people of God and other nations;
   thirdly, between "the works of God's hands" and the works of men, (for
   by God's hand alone can the Church be restored;) and fourthly, between
   her flourishing condition and the ruinous and desolate state to which
   she had formerly been reduced. By the phrase, "in the midst of him," is
   meant a perfect restoration, by which the people shall be united and
   joined together in such a manner as to occupy not only the extremities,
   but the very heart and the chief places of the country.

   They shall hallow my name. Last of all, he points out the end of
   redemption. We were all created, that the goodness of God might be
   celebrated among us. But as the greater part of mankind have revolted
   from their original condition, God hath chosen a Church in which his
   praises should resound and dwell, as the Psalmist says, "Praise waiteth
   for thee in Zion." (Psalm 65:1.) Now, since many even of the flock have
   degenerated, the Prophet assigns this office to believers, whom God had
   miraculously preserved.

   They shall fear the God of Israel. Because hypocrites, as we have
   formerly seen, honor God with their lips, but are far removed from him
   in their heart, after speaking of the ascription of praise, he next
   mentions fear; thus meaning that our praises are reckoned of no value,
   unless we honestly and sincerely obey God, and unless our whole life
   testify that we do not hypocritically utter the name of God.

   24. Then shall the erring in spirit learn wisdom. He again repeats that
   promise which he formerly noticed briefly; for so long as the
   understandings of men shall be struck with ignorance and blindness,
   even though they enjoy abundance of every kind of blessings, yet they
   are always surrounded and besieged by ruin. In making preparation for
   the restoration of the Church, the Lord therefore enlightens by his
   word, and illuminates by the light of understanding, his own people,
   who formerly wandered astray in darkness. He does this by the secret
   influence of the Spirit; for it would be of little value to be taught
   by the external word, if he did not also instruct our hearts inwardly.

   And the murmurers shall learn doctrine. Some commentators translate
   rvgnym (rOgEnim) "whisperers," and others, "wanderers." But it means
   that those who formerly murmured against the prophets, and could not
   endure their warnings, would be obedient and submissive; and therefore
   I have chosen to render it murmurers. Hence we see how wonderful is the
   mercy of God, who brings back into the path those who were highly
   unworthy, and makes them partakers of so great blessings. Let us
   carefully ponder this subject in private. Is there any one of us that
   has not sometimes "murmured" against God, and despised pure doctrine?
   Nay, more, if God had not softened the obstinate, and brought them
   mildly to obey, nearly the whole human race would have perished in
   their madness.

   suppose it to be taken from the hearth of the great altar of
   burnt-offerings, which Ezekiel plainly calls by the same name; and that
   Jerusalem is here considered as the seat of the fire of God, la 'vr 'l
   (Or el,) which should issue from thence to consume his enemies. Compare
   chap. Isaiah 31:9. Some, according to the common derivation of the
   word, 'ry 'l (ariel,) the lion of God, or the strong lion, suppose it
   to signify the strength of the place, by which it was enabled to resist
   and overcome all its enemies." -- Lowth. "Jonathan interprets it the
   altar of the Lord, and Ezekiel also (Ezekiel 43:15) gives it this name.
   It is so called, on account of the fire of God, which couched like 'ry
   (ari,) a lion on the altar. Our Rabbins explain 'ry'l (ariel) to denote
   the temple of Jerusalem, which was narrow behind, and broad in front."
   -- Jarchi. "The greater part of interpreters are agreed, that 'ry'l
   (ariel) compounded of 'ry (ari) and 'l (el,) denotes the lion of God,
   or, as Castalio renders it, The Lion -- God. But they differ in
   explaining the application of this name to Jerusalem." -- Rosenmüller.
   "The meaning of the Prophet, in my opinion, is, that God will make
   Jerusalem the heart of his anger, which shall consume not only the
   enemies but the obstinate rebellious Jews.' This meaning is elegant and
   emphatic, and agrees well with the wisdom of the prophet Isaiah. Ariel
   is here taken, in its true signification, not for the altar, but for
   the hearth of the altar, as in Ezekiel. The import of the name lies
   here. The hearth of the altar sustained the symbol of the most holy and
   pure will of God, by which all the sacrifices offered to God must be
   tried; and to this applies the justice of God, burning like a fire, and
   consuming the sinner, if no atonement be found. Jerusalem would become
   the theater of the divine judgments." -- Vitringa. "Isaiah foresees
   that the city will, in a short time, be besieged by a very numerous
   army of the Assyrians, and will be reduced to straits, and yet will not
   be vanquished by those multitudes, but, like a lion, will rise by
   divine power out of the severest encounters." -- Doederlein ^FT510
   Instead of "Let them kill sacrifices," Vitringa's rendering, in which
   he has been followed by Lowth, Stock, and Alexander, is, "Let the
   feasts revolve." -- Ed ^FT511 Symmachus, on whom Montfaucon bestows the
   exaggerated commendation of having adhered closely to the Hebrew text,
   wherever it differed from the Septuagint, renders the clause, kai estai
   katodunos kai odunomene, which has been closely followed by Jerome's
   version, "Et erit tristis ac moerens;" -- "And she shall be sad and
   sorrowful." -- Ed ^FT512 In both cases there are two synonyms, t'nyh
   v'nyh (thaaniah vaaniah,) which are derived from the same root. This
   peculiarity is imitated by the version of Symmachus quoted above,
   katodunos kai odunomene, and by that of Vitringa, ("moestitia et
   moeror,") who remarks: "It is somewhat unusual to bring together words
   of the same termination and derived from the same root, but in this
   instance it produces an agreeable echo, which convinces me that it must
   have been frequently employed in poetical writings." -- Ed ^FT513 "Que
   les ennemis feront en Jerusalem;" -- "Which the enemies shall make in
   Jerusalem." ^FT514 "Like a circle of tents. ndvr, (kaddur,) like a
   Dowar; so the Arabs call a circular village of tents, such as they
   still live in." -- Stock ^FT515 "Qu'ils parleront bas, et comme du
   creux de la terre;" -- "That they will speak low, and as out of the
   heart of the earth." ^FT516 "And from the dust thou shalt chirp thy
   words, or, utter a feeble, stridulous sound, such as the vulgar
   supposed to be the voice of a ghost. This sound was imitated by
   necromancers, who had also the art of pitching their voice in such a
   manner as to make it appear to proceed out of the ground, or from what
   place they chose." -- Stock ^FT517 The Septuagint renders it, kai estai
   hos koniortos apo trochou ho ploutos ton asebon, "and as the small dust
   from the wheel shall be the multitude of the wicked." Here it is
   necessary to attend to the distinction between trochos and trochos --
   Ed ^FT518 The military forces of Sennacherib, which shall be fuel for
   the fire, and shall be reduced to powder." -- Jarchi ^FT519 "They shall
   be destroyed by the pestilential blast Simoom, whose effects are
   instantaneous. Thevenot describes this wind with all the circumstances
   here enumerated, with thunder and lightning, insufferable heat, and a
   whirlwind of sand. By such an angel of Jehovah,' as it is called below,
   (Isaiah 37:36,) was the host of Assyria destroyed." -- Stock ^FT520 "As
   a dream, when one thinks that he sees, and yet does not in reality see,
   so shall be the multitude of nations; they will indeed think that they
   are subduing the city of Jerusalem, but they shall be disappointed of
   that hope, they shall not succeed in it." -- Jarchi ^FT521 The
   comparison is elegant and beautiful in the highest degree, well wrought
   up, and perfectly suited to the end proposed: the image is extremely
   natural, but not obvious; it appeals to our inward feelings, not to our
   outward senses, and is applied to an event in its concomitant
   circumstances exactly similar, but in its nature totally different. For
   beauty and ingenuity it may fairly come in competition with one of the
   most elegant of Virgil, (greatly improved from Homer, Iliad, 22:199,)
   where he has applied to a different purpose, but not so happily, the
   same image of the ineffectual working of imagination in a dream. Virg.
   Æn. 12:908. Lucretius expresses the very same image with Isaiah, (iv.
   1091.)" -- Lowth ^FT522 "Cry ye out, and cry, or, Take your pleasure
   and riot." -- Eng. Ver. "Turn yourselves and stare around." -- Stock.
   Lowth's rendering resembles this, but is somewhat paraphrastic, "They
   stare with a look of stupid surprise." Professor Alexander's comes
   nearer that of Calvin, "Be merry and blind!" -- Ed ^FT523 "Your
   prophets, and your rulers (Heb. heads)." -- Eng. Ver. Our translators
   very correctly state that the literal meaning of rsykm (rashechEm) is,
   "your heads." Calvin treats it as an adjective, "your principal seers."

   English version. -- Ed ^FT533 In almost all the ancient versions
   hphkkm, (hophchEchEm,) generally rendered "your turning," is construed
   as the nominative to the verb "shall be." Modern critics treat it as a
   separate clause, and exclamation. "Perverse as ye are!" -- Lowth.
   "Perverseness of yours!" -- Stock. "Your perversion!" -- Alexander. The
   same meaning had been brought out by Luther, though in a paraphrastic
   form, Wie seyb ihr so verfehrt! "How are you so perverse!" -- Ed ^FT534
   This rendering is followed by Lowth and Stock. "Ere Lebanon beams like
   Carmel. A mashal, or proverbial saying, expressing any great revolution
   of things, and, when respecting two subjects, an entire reciprocal
   change." -- Lowth. "And Lebanon shall be turned into a Carmel. That
   which is now desert shall become a fruitful field, and the reverse. Or,
   to quit the figure, the poor and illiterate shall change conditions
   with the great ones and the wise of this world, with respect to
   happiness, when the gospel shall be promulgated." -- Stock. Jarchi, on
   the other hand, views "Carmel" as meaning "a fruitful field," and
   Alexander regards this point as decided by the use of the article.
   "That hkrml (hakkarmEl) is not the proper name of the mountain, may be
   inferred from the article, which is not prefixed to Lebanon.'" "The
   mention of the latter," he adds, "no doubt suggested that of the
   ambiguous term Carmel, which is both a proper name and an appellative."
   -- Ed ^FT535 "Ceux qui n'ont point honte de commettre leurs
   meschancetez devant tous;" -- "Those who are not ashamed to commit
   their acts of wickedness in presence of all." ^FT536 "Ceux qui se
   levoyent de matin pour mal faire;" -- "They who rose early to do evil."
   ^FT537 "Il dit aussi que le juste est renversé sans raison;" -- "He
   says also, that the righteous man is overthrown without any good
   reason." ^FT538 Both of the above quotations are made inaccurately. The
   words of Jeremiah are, "He putteth his mouth in the dust," and of
   Micah, "They shall lay their hand upon their mouth." But while the
   Author, quoting from memory, has altered the words, the passages are
   exceedingly apposite to his purpose. -- Ed ^FT539 "Qu'ils peuvent
   savoir ce que nous faisons au monde;" -- "That they can know what we
   are doing in the world."

   CHAPTER 30
     __________________________________________________________________

   Isaiah 30:1-33

   1. Woe to the rebellious children, saith the Lord, that take counsel,
   but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my Spirit,
   that they may add sin to sin:

   1. Væ filiis contumacibus, (vel, perversis) dicit Iehova, ut capiant
   consilium, et non ex me; ut operiant arcanum. (vel, fundant fusionem,)
   et non ex spiritu meo; ut peccatum addant peccato.

   2. That walk to go down into Egyst, and have not asked at my mouth; to
   strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the
   shadow of Egypt!

   2. Proficiscuntur ut descendant in Ægyptum, et os meum non
   interrogaverunt, roborantes se robore Pharaonis, et sperantes in umbra
   Ægypti.

   3. Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust
   in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.

   3. Erit autem vobis fortitudo Pharaonis in pudorem, et fiducia in umbra
   Ægypti in ignominiam.

   4. For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.

   4. Fuerunt enim principes ejus in Zoan et legati ejus in Hanes
   venerunt.

   5. They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be
   an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.

   5. Omnes pudefient in populo qui eis non proderit, neque auxilio erit,
   neque commodum afferet; sed erit in pudorem, atque etiam in opprobrium.

   6. The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and
   anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery
   flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of
   young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a
   people that shall not profit them

   6. Onus jumentorum Austri. In terra afflictionis et angustiæ, leo, et
   leo major ab illis, vipera et prester volans, dum portabunt super
   humerum pullorum divitias suas, et super gibbos camelorum thesauros
   suos ad populum qui non proderit.

   7. For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore
   have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.

   7. Certe Ægyptii vanitas, et frustra auxiliabuntur. Propterea clamavi
   ad illam: Robur illorum quiescere.

   8. Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that
   it may be for the time to come for ever and ever;

   8. Nunc vade, et scribe hanc visionem in tabula coram ipsis, et in
   libro insculpe eam; ut sit in diem novissimum, in perpetuum usque in
   secula.

   9. That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will
   not hear the law of the Lord:

   9. Quod populus hic rebellis sit, filii mendaces, filii qui recusant
   audire legem Iohivæ.

   10. Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not
   unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:

   10. Qui dicunt videntibus, ne videatis, et prospicientibus, ne
   prospiciatis nobis recta; loquimini nobis blanditias, videte errores.

   11. Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy
   One of Israel to cease from before us.

   11. Recedite a via, declinate a semita; facite ut a facie nostra
   facessat Sanctus Israel.

   12. Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise
   this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:

   12. Propterea sic dicit Sanctus Israel: quia respuistis verbum hoc, et
   confisi estis in violentia et pravitate, et innixi estis in eam;

   13. Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall,
   swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an
   instant.

   13. Ideo erit vobis iniquitas hæc quasi ruptura cadens, tumor in alto
   muro, cujus repente et subito venit fractura.

   14. And he shall break it as the breaking of the potter's vessel that
   is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be
   found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to
   take water withal out of the pit.

   14. Et contritio ejus quasi contritio vasis figulorum, quod absque
   misericordia comminuitur; nec in ejus fractura invenitur testa adignem
   e foco ferendum, vel aquam e puteo hauriendum.

   15. For thus saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, In returning
   and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be
   your strength; and ye would not.

   15. Quoniam sic dixit Dominus Iehova Sanctus Israel: In requie et
   quiete salvi eritis; in tranquillitate et fiducia erit fortitudo
   vestra, sed noluistis.

   16. But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye
   flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that
   pursue you be swift.

   16. Et dixistis, Non, sed equis effugiemus; propterea fugietis; super
   celerem conscendemus; propterea celeriores erunt qui vos persequentur.

   17. One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five
   shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain,
   and as an ensign on an hill.

   17. Mille unus a facie increpationis unius a facie increpationis
   quinque fugietis, donec relicti fueritis sicut malus navis in vertice
   montis, et sicut vexillum in colle.

   18. And therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto you;
   and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for
   the Lord is a God of judgement: blessed are all they that wait for him.

   18. Propterea expectabit vos Iehova, ut misereatur vestri; et propterea
   exaltabitur, ut propitius sit vobis; quia Deus judicii Iehova. Beati
   omnes qui expectant eum.

   19. For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem; thou shalt weep no
   more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when
   he shall hear it, he will answer thee.

   19. Certe populus in Sion habitabit in Ierusalem; flendo non flebis;
   miserendo miserebitur tui; ad vocem clamoris tui, simulac audierit,
   respondebit tibi.

   20. And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water
   of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any
   more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:

   20. Ubi dederit vobis Dominus panem angoris et aquam afflictionis, non
   arcebitur pluvia tua, et oculi tui videbunt pluviam tuam.

   21. And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the
   way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to
   the left.

   21. Tum aures tuæ audient verbum a tergo tuo, dicendo: Hæc via,
   ambulate in ea, sive ad dextram sive ad sinistram eatis.

   22. Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver,
   and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them
   away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.

   22. Tum profanabitis tectorium sculptilium argenti tui, et operimentum
   conflatilis auri tui, separabisque ea tanquam pannum menstruo infectum,
   dices qui illi: Egredere (vel, Apage.)

   23. Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the
   ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be
   fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.

   23. Tum dabit pluviam semini tuo, cum seminaveris terram, et panem
   proventus terræ; et erit uber et pinguis, et pascentur pecora tua in
   die illo in amplis pascuis.

   24. The oxen likewise, and the young asses that ear the ground, shall
   eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with
   the fan.

   24. Boves etiam tui, et pulli asinorum colentes terram, pabulum purum
   comedent, quod in pala ventilatum erit et in vanno.

   25. And there shal be upon every high mountain, and upon every high
   hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter,
   when the towers fall.

   25. Et accidet, ut super omnem montem excelsum, et super omnem collem
   elevatum, sint rivi, rivi aquarum in die cædis magnæ cum turres
   corruerint.

   26. Moreover, the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun,
   and the light of the sun shall be seven-fold, as the light of seven
   days in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people, and
   healeth the stroke of their wound.

   26. Et erit lux lunæ sicut lux solis, et lux solis septuplo major,
   quasi lux septem dierum, in die qui alligaverit Iehova fracturam populi
   sui, et perfossionem plagæ ejus sanaverit.

   27. Behold, the name of the Lord cometh from far, burning with his
   anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of
   indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:

   27. Ecce nomen Iehovæ venit e loco remoto; ardens facies ejus, et grave
   onus; labia ejus plena sunt indignatione; et lingua ejus quasi ignis
   devorans.

   28. And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst
   of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there
   shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.

   28. Et spiritus ejus quasi torrens inundans, usque ad collum dividet;
   ad ventilandas gentes in cribro inutili, et frænum errare faciens in
   maxillis populorum.

   29. Ye shall have a song, as in the night, when a holy solemnity is
   kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into
   the mountain of the Lord, to the mighty One of Israel.

   29. Canticum erit vobis, quemadmodum in nocte dum celebratur dies
   festus, et lætitia cordis quasi ejus qui ad tibiam incedit, ut veniat
   ad montem Iehovæ, ad Fortem Israelis.

   30. And the Lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall
   shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger,
   and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest,
   and hailstones.

   30. Et audiri faciet Iehova potentiam vocis suæ, et descensionem
   brachii sui videri faciet, cum furore vultus et flamma ignis vorantis,
   dissipatione, inundatione, et lapide grandinis.

   31. For through the voice of the Lord shall the Assyrian be beaten
   down, which smote with a rod.

   31. Sane a voce Iehovæ conteretur Assur, qui virga percussit.

   32. And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the
   Lord shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in
   battles of shaking will he fight with it.

   32. Et erit in omni transitu baculus fundatus, quam infliget Iehova
   super eum cum tympanis, et citharis, et præliis elevationis pugnabit
   contra eam.

   33. For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared: he
   heath made it deep and large; the pile thereof is fire and much wood;
   the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.

   33. Quoniam ordinata est ab hesterno Tophet: etiam Regi præparata est:
   quam in profundum posuit et dilatavit. Pyra ejus ignis, et ligna multa;
   flatus Iehovæ quasi torrens sulphuris succendit eam.


   1. Woe to the rebellious children. The Prophet exclaims against the
   Jews, because, when they were unable to bear the burden, when they were
   hard pressed by the Assyrians and other enemies, they fled to Egypt for
   help. This reproof might appear to be excessively severe, were we
   merely to consider that weak and miserable men, especially when they
   are unjustly oppressed, have a right to ask assistance even from wicked
   persons; for it is a principle implanted in us by nature, that all
   human beings should willingly, and of their own accord, endeavour to
   assist each other. But when we come to the very sources, we shall find
   that no ordinary or inconsiderable guilt had been contracted by the
   people.

   First, it is no light offense, but wicked obstinacy, to disregard and
   even despise God's government, and follow their own inclinations. But
   God had strictly forbidden them to enter into any alliance or league
   with the Egyptians. (Exodus 13:17; Deuteronomy 17:16.) There were
   chiefly two causes of this prohibition. One was general, and related to
   alliances and leagues with other nations; for God did not wish that his
   people should be corrupted by the superstitions of the Gentiles.
   (Exodus 23:32; 34:15; Deuteronomy 7:2.) We are gradually infected, I
   know not how, by the vices of those with whom we have intercourse and
   familiarity; and as we are more prone by nature to copy vices than
   virtues, we easily become accustomed to corruptions, and, in short, the
   infection rapidly spreads from one person to another. This has happened
   to our own country, France, in consequence of having intercourse with
   many nations, which leads her too eagerly to imitate their vices, and
   has covered her with frightful pollution. This immoderate desire of
   forming alliances unlocked Asia to the Mahometans, and next laid Europe
   open to them; and though they still retain their moderation in eating
   and drinking, all that has been subdued by their arms has contracted
   nothing but filth and debasement. This is what we Frenchmen have also
   derived from our intercourse with other nations.

   The second reason was special and peculiar to this nation; for, since
   the Lord had delivered the Jews out of Egypt, and commanded them to
   remember so remarkable a benefit, he forbade them to have any
   intercourse with the Egyptians. And if they had entered into an
   alliance with the Egyptians, the remembrance of that benefit might
   easily have been obliterated; for they would not have been at liberty
   to celebrate it in such a manner as had been commanded. (Exodus 13:3,
   8,14.) It was excessively base to disregard the glory of God for the
   purpose of cultivating friendship with an irreligious and wicked
   nation. Since God intended also to testify to his people that he alone
   was more than sufficient to secure their safety, they ought to have
   valued that promise so highly as to exclude themselves willingly from
   other assistance. It was a very heinous crime to endeavour to gain the
   favour of heathen nations on all sides, and to deprive God of the
   honour due to him; for if they had been satisfied with having God's
   protection alone, they would not have been in such haste to run down to
   Egypt. Their noisy eagerness convicted them of infidelity.

   Yet I have no doubt that the Prophet directed his indignation against
   that sacrilege, because, by laboring earnestly to obtain the assistance
   of the nations around them, they withheld from God the praise of
   almighty power. Hence also the Spirit elsewhere compares that ardor to
   the extravagances of love, and even to licentious courses. (Jeremiah
   5:8.) Ezekiel shews that, by joining the Egyptians, they acted as if a
   woman, shamefully transgressing the bounds of decency, not only ran
   furiously after adulterers, but even desired to associate with horses
   and asses. (Ezekiel 16:26.) And yet here he does not absolutely condemn
   all leagues that are made with idolaters, but has especially in view
   that prohibition by which the law forbade them to enter into alliance
   with the Egyptians. It is chiefly on account of the prohibition that he
   kindles into such rage; for it was not without pouring grievous
   contempt on God that they ran trembling into Egypt. For this reason he
   calls them svrrym, (sOrErim,) obstinate and rebellious. We have
   explained this word at the first chapter. [284] It denotes men of
   hardened wickedness, who knowingly and willingly revolt from God, or
   whose obstinacy renders them objects of disgust, so that no integrity
   or sincerity is left in them. At first he reproves that vice on this
   ground, that they neglected the word of God, and were devoted to their
   own counsels.

   That they may cover the secret. The words lnsk mskh, (lInsOch
   massechah,) are explained by some commentators to mean, "to pour out
   the pouring out." Though this is not at variance with the Prophet's
   meaning, yet it is more correctly, in my opinion, translated by others,
   "that they may cover a covering." I have followed that version, because
   the words relate to counsels held secretly and by stealth, by which
   they cunningly endeavored to deceive the prophets, and, as it were, to
   escape from the eyes of God. Another rendering, "that they may hide
   themselves by a covering," is absurd; for although it was for the sake
   of protection that they sought the Egyptians, yet he rather alludes to
   that craftiness of which I have spoken. Both expositions amount to the
   same thing. [285]

   By three modes of expression he makes nearly the same statement; that
   they "cover their counsels," that is, keep them apart from God; that
   they do not ask at "the mouth of the Lord;" and that they do not suffer
   themselves to be governed by "his Spirit." They who are guided by their
   own views turn aside to cunning contrivances, that they may conceal
   their unbelief and rebellion; and because they have resolved not to
   obey the word of God, neither do they ask his Spirit. Hence arises that
   miserable and shameful result. Wretchedly and ruinously must those
   deliberations and purposes end, over which the Lord does not preside.
   There is no wisdom that is not obtained from "his mouth;" and if we
   "ask at his mouth," that is, if we consult his word, we shall also be
   guided by his Spirit, from whom all prudence and wisdom proceeds.

   Let it be observed that two things are here connected, the word and the
   Spirit of God, in opposition to fanatics, who aim at oracles and hidden
   revelations without the word; for they wish to come to God, while they
   neglect and forsake the word, and thus they do nothing else than
   attempt, as the saying is, to fly without wings. First of all, let it
   be held as a settled principle, that whatever we undertake or attempt,
   without the word of God, must be improper and wicked, because we ought
   to depend wholly on his mouth. And indeed, if we remember what
   feebleness of understanding, or rather, what lack of understanding, is
   found in all mankind, we shall acknowledge that they are excessively
   foolish who claim for themselves so much wisdom, that they do not even
   deign to ask at the mouth of God.

   If it be objected, that the Scriptures do not contain everything, and
   that they do not give special answers on those points of which we are
   in doubt, I reply, that everything that relates to the guidance of our
   life is contained in them abundantly. If, therefore, we have resolved
   to allow ourselves to be directed by the word of God, and always seek
   in it the rule of life, God will never suffer us to remain in doubt,
   but in all transactions and difficulties will point out to us the
   conclusion. Sometimes, perhaps, we shall have to wait long, but at
   length the Lord will rescue and deliver us, if we are ready to obey
   him. Although, therefore, we are careful and diligent in the use of
   means, as they are called, yet we ought always to attend to this
   consideration, not to undertake anything but what we know to be
   pleasing and acceptable to God.

   The Prophet condemns the presumption of those who attempt unlawful
   methods, and think that they will succeed in them, when they labor,
   right or wrong, to secure their safety, as if it could be done contrary
   to the will of God. It is certain that this proceeds from unbelief and
   distrust, because they do not think that God alone is able to protect
   them, unless they call in foreign though forbidden assistance. Hence
   come unlawful leagues, hence come tricks and cheating, by which men
   fully believe that their affairs will be letter conducted than if they
   acted towards each other with candour and fairness. There are
   innumerable instances of this unbelief in every department of human
   life; for men think that they will be undone, if they are satisfied
   with the blessing of God, and transact all their affairs with truth and
   uprightness. But we ought to consider that we are forsaken, rejected,
   and cursed by God, whenever we have recourse to forbidden methods and
   unlawful ways. In all our undertakings, deliberations, and attempts,
   therefore, we ought to be regulated by the will of God. We ought always
   to consider what he forbids or commands, so as to be fully disposed to
   obey his laws, and to submit ourselves to be guided by his Spirit,
   otherwise our rashness will succeed very ill.

   That they may add sin to sin. The Prophet says this, because the Jews,
   by those useless defences which they supposed to fortify them strongly,
   did nothing else than stumble again on the same stone, and double their
   criminality, which already was very great. Our guilt is increased, and
   becomes far heavier, when we endeavor, by unlawful methods, to escape
   the wrath of God. But we ought especially to consider this expression
   as applicable to the Jews, because, after having brought the Assyrians
   into Judea, (for they had called them to their assistance against
   Israel and Syria,) they wished to drive them out by the help of the
   Egyptians. (2 Kings 16:7, 17:4, 18:21.) The Jews were hard pressed by
   the Assyrians, and were justly punished for their unbelief, because
   they resorted to men, and not to God, for aid; and we see that this
   happened to many nations who called the Turk to their assistance. So
   far were the Jews from repenting of their conduct, and acknowledging
   that they had been justly punished, that they even added evil to evil,
   as if crime could be washed out by crime. On this account they are more
   severely threatened; for they who persevere in their wickedness, and
   rush with furious eagerness against God, and do not allow themselves to
   be brought back to the right path by any warnings or chastisements,
   deserve to be more sharply and heavily punished.

   2. They walk that they may go down into Egypt. The reason why the
   Prophet condemns this "going down" has been already explained; [286]
   but as their guilt was aggravated by open and heinous obstinacy, he
   again repeats that they did this without asking at the mouth of God,
   and even in the face of his prohibition.

   Strengthening themselves with the strength of Pharaoh. He again draws
   their attention to the source of the evil, when he says that it was
   done for the purpose of acquiring strength, because they placed
   confidence in the forces of the Egyptians. Hence arose that lawless
   desire of entering into a league. In this way they shewed that they
   cared little about the power of God, and did not greatly trust in him;
   and they openly displayed their unbelief.

   It might be objected, that men are the servants of God, and that it is
   lawful for any one to make use of their services, whenever they are
   needed. I reply, that while we make use of the labors and services of
   men, it ought to be in such a manner as to depend on God alone. But
   there was another reason peculiar to the Jews, for they knew that God
   had forbidden them to call the Egyptians to their assistance, and, by
   doing so, they withheld from God all that they ascribed to Pharaoh and
   to his forces. Thus it is not without good reason that Isaiah contrasts
   Pharaoh with God; for the creatures are opposed to God, and enter, as
   it were, into contest with him when they rise up against God, or
   whenever men abuse them, or place their hearts and confidence in them,
   or desire them more than is lawful.

   3. But to you shall the strength of Pharaoh be shame. He now shews what
   shall be the end of the wicked, who despise God and his word, and
   follow those schemes which are most agreeable to their own views. All
   that they undertake shall tend to their ruin. He threatens not only
   that they shall be disappointed of their hope, but also that they are
   seeking with great toil, destruction and ruin, from which they will
   gain nothing but sorrow and disgrace. To all wicked men it must
   unavoidably happen that, although for a time they appear to gain their
   object, and though everything succeeds to their wish, yet in the end
   all shall be ruinous to them. It is the just reward of their rashness,
   when they go beyond the limits of the word; for nothing that has been
   acquired by wicked and unlawful methods can be of advantage to any
   person.

   By way of admission he calls it "the strength of Pharaoh," as if he had
   said, "You think that you gain much protection from Pharaoh, but it
   will yield you reproach and disgrace. The shadow of Egypt, by which you
   hoped to be covered, will make you blush for shame." Accordingly, both
   expressions, "shame" and "disgrace," have the same meaning; and as
   chrphh, (chErpah,) [287] reproach, is a stronger expression than
   "shame," it is afterwards added for the purpose of bringing out the
   meaning more fully.

   4. For his princes were in Zoan. The Prophet not only says that the aid
   of the Egyptians was sought, and that they were invited to assist, but
   expresses something more, namely, that the Jews obtained it with great
   labor and expense. They had to perform long and painful journeys, to
   endure much toil, and to expend vast sums of money, in order to arrive,
   loaded with presents, at the most distant cities of Egypt, which are
   here named by the Prophet. On this embassy were sent, not persons of
   mean or ordinary rank, but "princes" and nobles; and therefore the
   censure was more severe, because they slavishly solicited an alliance
   with Egypt, and wandered like suppliants through various countries. It
   is proper also to bear in mind the contrast which we have already
   pointed out. They did not need to go far to seek God; they did not need
   to endure much toil, or spend large sums of money, in calling on him.
   He invited them by his promise, "This is my rest," and assured them
   that in that place they would not call upon him in vain. (Psalm 132:14;
   Isaiah 28:12.) But those wretched persons despised God, and chose
   rather to torment themselves, and to run to the very ends of the world,
   than to receive the assistance which was offered to them.

   5. They shall all be ashamed. He confirms the former statement; for it
   was very difficult to convince ungodly men that all that they undertook
   without the word of God would be ruinous to them. In order to punish
   them more severely, God sometimes bestows on them prosperity, that they
   may be more and more deceived, and may throw themselves down headlong;
   for by the righteous judgment of God it is brought about, that Satan
   draws them by these allurements, and drives them into his nets. Yet the
   final result is, that not only are they deprived of the assistance
   which they expected, but they are likewise severely punished both for
   their presumption and for their unbelief.

   Of a people that will not profit them. He threatens not only that the
   Egyptians will prove false, as wicked men often forsake at the utmost
   need, or even treacherously ruin, those whom they have fed with empty
   promises, but that even though they endeavor to the utmost to fulfill
   the promises which they have made, still they will be of no use.
   Whatever may be the earnestness with which men endeavor to help us,
   yet, as events are in the hand of God, they will "profit nothing"
   without his blessing. It was difficult to believe when the Prophet
   spoke, that a nation so powerful could yield no assistance; but we
   ought always to hold it as a principle fully settled, that all the
   advantage that dazzles us in the world will vanish away, except in so
   far as God is gracious and kind, and makes it sure for our advantage.

   6. The burden of the beasts of the south. After having spoken loudly
   against the consultations of the Jews about asking assistance from the
   Egyptians, he ridicules the enormous cost and the prodigious
   inconveniences which they endured on that account; for at so high a
   price did they purchase their destruction; and he threatens the same
   curse as formerly, because unhappily they acted in opposition to the
   word of God. He mentions "the south," because they journeyed through a
   southern region, Egypt being situated to "the south" of Judea. He
   therefore calls them "beasts of burden" on account of the journey, and
   addresses them in order to pour contempt on men, because it was in vain
   to speak to them, and they were deaf to all exhortations. Accordingly,
   he threatens that the effect of this prediction shall reach the very
   "beasts of burden," though men do not understand it.

   In the land of trouble and distress. The people having proudly
   disregarded the threatenings, the Prophet seasonably turns to the
   horses and camels; and declares that, although they are void of reason,
   yet they shall perceive that God hath not spoken in vain, and that,
   though the people imagined that there was uninterrupted prosperity in
   Egypt, it would be a land of anguish and affliction even to the brute
   animals. The journey was labourious and difficult, and yet they shrunk
   from no exertion in order to satisfy their mad desire; and to such a
   pitch of madness was their ardor carried, that they were not
   discouraged by the tediousness of the journey.

   The young lion and the strong lion. In addition to the inconveniences
   already mentioned, Isaiah threatens the special vengeance of God, that
   they shall encounter "lions" and beasts of prey. There was nothing new
   or uncommon in this to persons who traveled from Judea into Egypt; but
   here he threatens something extraordinary and more dangerous. In
   addition to the inconveniences and toils, and to the sums of money
   which they shall expend, God will also send disastrous occurrences, and
   at length they shall be miserably ruined.

   This doctrine ought to be applied to us, who are chargeable with a
   fault exceedingly similar; for in dangers we fly to unlawful remedies,
   and think that they will profit us, though God disapproves of them. We
   must therefore experience the same result and fall into the same
   dangers, if we do not restrain our unbelief and wickedness by the word
   of God. We ought also to observe and guard against that madness which
   hurries us along to spare no expense and to shrink from no toil, while
   we obey with excessive ardor our foolish desire and wish. We had
   abundant experience of this in Popery, when we were held captives by
   it, running about in all directions, and wearying ourselves with long
   and toilsome pilgrimages to various saints; yet the greatest possible
   annoyances were reckoned by us to be light and trivial. But now, when
   we are commanded to obey God and to endure "the light yoke" of Christ,
   (Matthew 11:30,) we find that we cannot endure it.

   7. Surely the Egyptians are vanity. [288] This verse contains the
   explanation of the former statement; for he repeats and threatens the
   same thing, that the Egyptians, after having worn out the Jews by
   various annoyances and by prodigious expense, will be of no service to
   them. "The strength of Egypt" will do them no good, even though he be
   earnest in assisting them, and employ all his forces. Thus shall the
   Jews be disappointed of their hope, and deceive themselves to their
   great vexation. The particle v (u) signifies here either for or surely,
   as I have translated it.

   Therefore have I cried to her. He now shews that the Jews have no
   excuse for fleeing with such haste into Egypt, and that they are
   willingly foolish and unworthy of any pardon, because they do not
   repent when they are warned. When he says that he "cried" to Jerusalem,
   I consider this to refer to God himself, who complains that his
   distinct warnings and instructions produced no effect, and that his
   exhortation to them to sit still was not without foundation, but was
   intended to meet the troubles and calamities which he foresaw. Whence
   came that restlessness, but because they refused to believe the words
   of the Lord? In a word, he shews that it is mere obstinacy that drives
   them to flee into Egypt; for by "sitting still" they might provide for
   their safety.

   By the word "cry" he means that he not only warned them by words, but
   likewise chastised them; and this makes it evident that their obstinacy
   and rebellion were greater. "To sit still" means here "to remain and to
   stay at home," though he will afterwards shew (verse 15) that they
   ought to have peaceable dispositions. The cause of their alarm and
   impassioned exertions was, that they were terrified and struck with
   dismay, and did not think that God's protection was sufficient, if they
   had not also the Egyptians on their side. Thus, they who do not give
   sufficient honor to God have their hearts agitated by unbelief, so that
   they tremble and never find peace.

   8. Now go, and write this vision on a tablet. After having convicted
   the Jews of manifest unbelief, he means that it should be attested and
   sealed by permanent records, that posterity may know how obstinate and
   rebellious that nation was, and how justly the Lord punished them. We
   have said that it was customary with the prophets to draw up an
   abridgment of their discourses and attach it to the gates of the
   temple, and that, after having allowed full time to all to see and read
   it, the ministers took it down, and preserved it among the records of
   the temple; and thus the book of the prophets was collected and
   compiled. [289] But when any prediction was remarkable and peculiarly
   worthy of being remembered, then the Lord commanded that it should be
   written in larger characters, that the people might be induced to read
   it, and to examine it more attentively. (Isaiah 8:1; Habakkuk 2:2.) The
   Lord now commands that this should be done, in order to intimate that
   this was no ordinary affair, that the whole ought to be carefully
   written, and deserved the closest attention, and that it ought not only
   to be read, but to be engraven on the remembrance of men in such a
   manner that no lapse of time can efface it.

   Yet there can be no doubt that Isaiah, by this prediction, drew upon
   himself the intense hatred of all ranks, because he intended to expose
   and hold them up for abhorrence, not only among the men of his own age,
   but also among posterity. There is nothing which men resent more
   strongly than to have their crimes made publicly known and fastened on
   the remembrance of men; they reckon it ignominious and disgraceful, and
   abhor it above all things. But the Prophet must obey God, though he
   should become the object of men's hatred, and though his life should be
   in imminent danger. Here we ought to observe his steadfastness in
   dreading nothing, that he might obey God and fulfill his calling. He
   despised hatred, dislike, commotions, threatenings, false alarms, and
   immediate dangers, that he might boldly and fearlessly discharge the
   duties of his office. Copying his example, we ought to do this, if we
   wish to hear and follow God who calls us.

   Before them. 'tm (Ittam) is translated by some, "with them," but it is
   better to translate it "before them," or, "in their sight;" for it was
   proper that he should openly irritate the Jews, to whom he presented
   this prediction written "on a tablet." Hence we ought to infer, that
   wicked men, though they cannot bear reproof and are filled with rage,
   ought nevertheless to be reproved sharply and openly; and that
   threatenings and reproofs, though they be of no advantage to them, will
   yet serve for an example to others, when those men shall be stamped
   with perpetual infamy. In them will be fulfilled what is written
   elsewhere,

   "The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of
   a diamond engraven on their hearts." (Jeremiah 17:1.)

   They must not think that they have escaped, when they have despised the
   prophets and shut their ears against them; for their wickedness shall
   be manifest to men and to angels. But as they never repent willingly or
   are ashamed of their crimes, God commands that a record of their shame
   shall be prepared, that it may be placed continually before the eyes of
   men. As victories and illustrious actions were commonly engraved on
   tables of brass, so God commands that the disgrace which the Jews
   brought upon themselves by their transgressions, shall be inscribed on
   public tablets.

   That it may be till the last day. It was very extraordinary, as I
   remarked a little before, that the Prophet was charged by a solemn
   injunction to pronounce infamy on his countrymen. For this reason he
   adds "till the last day," either that they may be held up to abhorrence
   through an uninterrupted succession of ages, or because, at the
   appearance of the Judge, the crimes of the wicked shall be fully laid
   open when he shall "ascend his judgment seat, and the books shall be
   opened;" for those things which formerly were hidden and wrapped in
   darkness will then be revealed. (Daniel 7:10; Revelation 20:12.)

   Here it ought to be carefully observed, that prophecies were not
   written merely for the men of a single age, but that their children and
   all posterity ought to be instructed by them, that they may know that
   they ought not to imitate their fathers.

   "Harden not your hearts as your fathers did." (Psalm 95:8.)

   What Paul affirms as to the whole of Scripture is applicable to
   prophecy, that it

   "is profitable for warning, for consolation, and for instruction," (2
   Timothy 3:16;)

   and this is proper and necessary in every age. We must therefore reject
   the fancies of fanatics and wicked men, who say that this doctrine was
   adapted to those times, but affirm that it is not adapted to our times.
   Away with such blasphemies from the ears of the godly; for, when Isaiah
   died, his doctrine must flourish and yield fruit.

   9. For this is a rebellious people. The word for or because points to
   the explanation of what has been already said; for the Prophet explains
   what the Lord intends to declare to posterity, namely, that the
   perverseness of this nation is desperate, because they cannot submit to
   be restrained by any doctrine. That the honorable appellation of the
   "people" wounded to the quick the hearts both of the ordinary ranks and
   of the nobles, may be inferred from their loud vaunting; for they
   boasted that they were the holy and elect seed of Abraham; as if God's
   adoption had been a veil to cover the grossest crimes. But God commands
   that their crimes shall nevertheless be brought to light and openly
   proclaimed.

   Who refuse to hear the law of Jehovah. By accusing them of this, he
   points out the source of all evils, namely, contempt of the word, which
   discovers their wickedness and their contempt of God himself; for it is
   idle to pretend that they worship God, when they are disobedient to his
   word. Isaiah likewise aggravates their guilt, by saying that they
   reject the remedy which doctrine offers for curing their diseases. On
   this account he calls them not only "rebellious," and untameable or
   abandoned, but liars or treacherous persons; for they who refuse to
   obey the word of God, openly revolt from him, as if they could not
   endure his authority; and at the same time, they shew that they are
   given up to vanity and the delusions of Satan, so that they take no
   pleasure in sincerity.

   10. Who say to the seers, See not. He now describes more clearly, and
   shews, as it were, to the life, the contempt of God and obstinacy which
   he formerly mentioned; for wicked men not only pour ridicule on
   doctrine, but furiously drive it away, and would even wish to have it
   utterly crushed and buried. This is what Isaiah intended to express.
   Not only do they turn away their ears, and eyes, and all their senses,
   from doctrine, but they would even wish that it were destroyed and
   taken out of the way; for wickedness is invariably attended by such
   rage as would lead them to wish the destruction of that which they
   cannot endure. The power and efficacy of the word wounds and enrages
   them to such a degree, that they give vent to their fierceness and
   cruelty like wild and savage beasts. They would gladly escape, but
   whether they will or not, they are constrained to hear God speaking,
   and to tremble at his majesty. This bitterness is followed by hatred of
   the prophets, snares, alarms, persecutions, banishment, tortures, and
   deaths, by which they think that they can overturn and root out both
   the doctrine and the teachers; for men are more desirous to have dreams
   and fabulous tales told them than to be faithfully instructed.

   See not, prophesy not to us right things. The Prophet does not relate
   the words of wicked men, as if they openly made use of these words, but
   he describes the state of the fact and their actual dispositions; for
   he had not to do with men who were such fools as to make an intentional
   discovery of their wickedness. They were singularly cunning hypocrites,
   who boasted of worshipping God, and complained that they were unjustly
   reproached by the prophets. Isaiah tears off the mask by which they
   concealed themselves, and discovers what they are, because they refused
   to give place to the truth; for whence came the murmurs against the
   prophets, but because they could not bear to hear God speaking?

   The prophets were called seers, because the Lord revealed to them what
   would afterwards be made known to others. They were stationed, as it
   were, in a lofty place, that they might behold from on high, and as if
   from "a watch-tower," (Habakkuk 2:1,) the prosperous or adverse events
   which were approaching. The people wished that nothing of an adverse
   nature should be told them; and therefore they hated the prophets,
   because, while they censured and sharply reproved the vices of the
   people, they at the same time were witnesses of the approaching
   judgment of God. Such is the import of those words, "Do not see, do not
   prophesy right things." Not that they spoke in this manner, as we have
   already said, but because such was the state of their feelings, and
   because they desired that the prophets should speak with mildness, and
   could not patiently bear the sharpness of their reproofs. Not one of
   them was so impudent as to say that he wished to be deceived, and that
   he abhorred the truth; for they declared that they sought it with the
   greatest eagerness, as all our adversaries boast of doing at the
   present day; but they denied that what Isaiah and the other prophets
   told them was the word of God. In like manner they plainly told
   Jeremiah that he was "a liar," (Jeremiah 43:2,) and threatened him more
   insolently,

   "Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of the Lord,
   lest thou die by our hand." (Jeremiah 11:21.)

   To them the truth was intolerable; and when they departed from it, they
   could find nothing but falsehood, and thus they willingly chose to be
   deceived and to have falsehood told them.

   Speak to us smooth things. When he says that they desire "smooth
   things," [290] he points out the very source; for they were ready to
   receive flatterers with unbounded applause, and would willingly have
   allowed their ears to be tickled in the name of God. And this is the
   reason why the world is not only liable to be carried away by
   delusions, but earnestly desires them; for almost all wish to have
   their vices treated with forbearance and encouragement. But it is
   impossible that the servants of God, when they endeavor faithfully to
   discharge their duty, should be chargeable with being severe reprovers;
   and hence it follows that it is an idle and childish evasion, when
   wicked men pretend that they would willingly be God's disciples,
   provided that he were not rigorous. It is as if they bargained that,
   for their sake, he should change his nature and deny himself; as Micah
   also says, that no prophets were acceptable to the Jews, but such as
   "prophesied of wine and strong drink." (Micah 2:11.)

   11. Depart from the way. The amount of what is stated is, that when the
   prophets are set aside, the Lord is also rejected and set aside, and no
   regard is paid to him. Wicked men pretend the contrary, for they are
   ashamed to acknowledge so great wickedness. But they gain nothing by
   it; for God wishes that we should listen to him by means of those to
   whom he gave injunctions to declare his will to us, and to administer
   the doctrine of the word. If therefore it is our duty to listen to God,
   if we are bound to pay him any homage, we ought to shew it by embracing
   his word, as it is contained in the writings of the prophets and
   evangelists. This ought to be carefully observed in commendation of the
   word; for they who set it aside act as if they denied that he is God.

   Cause the Holy One of Israel to depart. Here he again points out the
   cause of so great wickedness, which doubles their guilt; namely, that
   God does not spare or flatter their vices, but acts the part of a good
   and skillful physician. Men desire to be flattered, and cannot
   patiently endure that God should threaten them. Hence it comes that men
   hate and reject the word. Hence proceeds the furious attack on the
   prophets, whose reproofs and threatenings they cannot endure; for there
   is no reason why men should revolt from the government of God, but
   because they take delight in what is wrong and crooked, and abhor the
   right way. Appropriately, therefore, does the Prophet join these two
   things, dislike of heavenly doctrine and hatred of uprightness.

   12. Because you have disdained this word. He next declares the
   punishment of ungodliness, threatening that they shall not pass
   unpunished for refusing to hear God speaking; and he expresses their
   contempt more strongly by the word "disdain." He calls it "this word,"
   making use of the demonstrative; for men would willingly contrive some
   word adapted to their manner of life, but refuse to listen to God when
   he speaks.

   And trusted in violence and wickedness. God's gentle invitation, and
   his exhortation to quiet rest, are here contrasted with their
   disorderly pursuits. The Hebrew word sq (gnOshEk) denotes "robbery,"
   and "seizing property which belongs to another." Others render it
   "ill-gotten wealth." Those who render it "calumny," do not sufficiently
   express the Prophet's meaning. For my own part, I do not view it as
   referring to riches gained by unlawful methods, but rather to that
   rebelliousness in which that nation insolently indulged.

   The word "wickedness," [291] which is added, ought not to be limited to
   decisions of courts of law; for, in my opinion, it has a more extensive
   signification; and by these two words he intended to express the
   presumption of wicked men, by which they fiercely and wantonly rose up
   against God, because they always dared to follow their own lawless
   desires, and to do what was forbidden. And as the poets feign that the
   giants made war with God, [292] so those men resisted God's
   threatenings, and thought that they would speedily overcome his power
   by their fierceness and presumption.

   13. Therefore shall your iniquity be like a breach falling. This is a
   threatening of punishment, and Isaiah expresses it by a very
   appropriate metaphor. He compares wicked men to a wall that is rent, or
   that bulges out. As the "swelling out" of a wall threatens the ruin of
   it, because it cannot stand unless all the parts of it adhere closely
   to each other, so the haughtiness and insolence of wicked men are a
   sign and very sure proof of their approaching ruin; because the more
   they are puffed up and swelled without any solid value, [293] the more
   readily do they throw themselves down headlong, and it is impossible
   for them not to fall speedily by their own weight. "Rise up," says he,
   "and act insolently against God; he will quickly put down your
   presumption and insolence, for it is but an empty swelling." Hence we
   learn that nothing is better for us than to submit wholly to God, and
   to keep charge of all our senses, so as to remain chained and bound by
   his authority; for they who raise themselves by shaking off all
   humility, destroy themselves by collecting much wind. For a time,
   indeed, the Lord permits wicked men to swell and utter their big words,
   that at length, by their "swelling" and idle boasting, they may bring
   upon themselves ruin and destruction.

   14. And the breaking of it shall be. When a wall has fallen, some
   traces of the ruin are still to be seen, and the stones of it may be
   applied to use, and to some extent the wall may even be rebuilt. But
   here the Prophet threatens that they who are puffed up with obstinacy
   against God shall perish in such a manner that they cannot be restored,
   and all that is left of them shall be utterly useless. Accordingly, he
   employs the metaphor of a potter's vessel, the broken fragments of
   which cannot be repaired or put together. These threatenings ought to
   make a deep impression upon us, that we may embrace with reverence the
   word of God, when we learn that punishments so severe are prepared for
   those who despise it; for the Prophet threatens that they shall be
   utterly destroyed and ruined, and takes away all hope of their being
   restored. Nor is the threatening groundless; for we see how they that
   despise God, when they have been twice and three times cast down, still
   do not cease to raise their crests; for nothing is more difficult than
   to root out the false confidence from their hearts. [294]

   15. For thus saith the Lord. Here he describes one kind of contempt of
   God; for when warnings are addressed to hypocrites in general terms,
   they commonly produce little effect. In addition to the general
   doctrine, therefore, the prophets specify particular instances, which
   they specially accommodate to the conduct of those with whom they have
   to do, so as always to aim at a definite object. They might have
   wrangled and urged, "Why do you accuse us of so great impiety, as if we
   rejected the word of the Lord?" He therefore brings forward this class,
   in order to strike their consciences and cut short their idle
   sophistry. "Was it not the word of the Lord, In hope and silence shall
   be your strength? why did you not rely on God? why did you raise a
   commotion?" Thus the Prophet holds them to be convicted, so that they
   cannot cavil without the grossest impudence, or, if they do so, will
   derive no advantage.

   The Holy One of Israel. He makes use of this appellation, in order to
   reproach them the more for their ingratitude, that they may know how
   great protection they would have found in God: for God wished to be
   their protector and guardian. When they had forsaken him, their
   distrust carried them away to solicit the aid of the Egyptians, which
   was very great and intolerable wickedness. This title contains a bitter
   complaint, that they shut out God from entering, when he drew near to
   them.

   In rest and quietness shall you be safe. Some render svvh (shubah)
   "repentance." Others render it "rest," [295] and I am more disposed to
   adopt that rendering; for I think that the Prophet intended frequently
   to impress upon the people, that the Lord demands more from them than
   to rely fully upon him. Nor is the repetition of the statement by two
   words superfluous; for he expressly intended to bring together the
   words "rest and quietness," in order to reprove the people the more
   sharply for their distrust and unbelief.

   This verse consists of two clauses, a command and a promise. He enjoins
   the people to be of a quiet disposition, and next promises that their
   salvation shall be certain. The people do not believe this promise, and
   consequently they do not obey the command; for how would they render
   obedience to God, whom they do not believe, and on whose promises they
   do not rely? We need not wonder, therefore, that they do not enjoy
   peace and repose; for these cannot exist without faith, and faith
   cannot exist without the promises, and as soon as the promises have
   been embraced, souls that were restless and uneasy are made calm. Thus,
   unbelief alone produces that uneasiness; and therefore the Prophet
   justly reproves it, and shews that it is the source of the whole evil.

   Though our condition be not entirely the same with that of the Jews,
   yet God commands us to wait for his assistance with quiet dispositions,
   not to murmur, or be troubled or perplexed, or to distrust his
   promises. This doctrine must belong equally to all believers; for the
   whole object of Satan's contrivances is to distress them, and to cast
   them down from their condition. In like manner had Moses long before
   addressed them,

   "You shall be silent, and the Lord will fight for you." (Exodus 14:14.)

   Not that he wished them to sleep or to be idle, but he enjoined them to
   have this peace in their hearts. If we have it, we shall feel that it
   yields us sufficient protection; and if not, we shall be punished for
   our levity and rashness.

   16. We will flee on horses; therefore shall you flee. He shews how they
   refused to wait calmly for the salvation of the Lord; for they chose
   rather to "flee" to the Egyptians. This is a very beautiful instance of
   (antanaklasis) throwing back an expression, by which he causes their
   words, so full of confidence, to recoil on themselves. In the first of
   these clauses, "to flee" means "to escape," and in the second it means
   "to take flight." The Jews said that it would be better for them, if
   they adopted timely measures for guarding against the danger which was
   close at hand, and consequently, that they would best provide for their
   safety by calling in the aid of the Egyptians. "You shall certainly
   flee," says Isaiah, "not to find a place of refuge, but to turn your
   back and to be pursued by horses swifter than yours."

   We now perceive more clearly what is the fault which Isaiah describes.
   By the distinct reply, No, he shews how obstinately they refused to
   comply with the advice which was given to them by the prophets, and
   chose rather to provide for their safety in another manner. Thus, by
   despising God, they gave a preference to a groundless appearance of
   safety, which they had allowed themselves to imagine. We ought,
   therefore, to turn away our minds from looking at present appearances
   and outward assistance, that they may be wholly fixed on God; for it is
   only when we are destitute of outward aid that we rely fully on him. It
   is lawful for us to use the things of this world for our assistance,
   but we altogether abuse them by our wickedness in forsaking God.

   It is proper also to observe how unhappy is the end of those who rely
   more on outward aids than on God; for everything must be unsuccessful
   and contrary to their expectation; as we see that these men, in their
   attempts to find safety, are constrained to undertake a flight which is
   highly disgraceful, and from which they obtain no advantage. At first
   there is some appearance of prosperity; but the only effect is, that
   the change of condition makes the final result more bitter and
   distressing. And yet Isaiah does not affirm that they will receive no
   assistance from Egypt, but forewarns them that the Lord will find new
   methods of thwarting that assistance, so that they will not be able to
   escape his hand; for, although all men agree together, yet they will
   not succeed in opposition to God and to his purposes.

   17. A thousand, as one, shall flee at the rebuke of one. Because the
   Jews, on account of their vast numbers, relied on their forces, as men
   are wont to do when they possess any power, therefore the Prophet
   threatens that all the protection which they have at home will be of no
   more avail to them than foreign aid, because the Lord will break and
   take away their courage, so that they shall not be able to make use of
   their forces. For what avail arms and a vast multitude of men? What
   avail fortresses and bulwarks, when men's hearts fail and are dismayed?
   It is therefore impossible for us to be strong and powerful, unless the
   Lord strengthen and uphold us by his Spirit. This statement occurs
   frequently in the law, that when they should revolt from God, a vast
   number of them would be put to flight by a very small number of
   enemies. But there is this difference between the law and the prophets,
   that the prophets apply to a particular subject what Moses announced in
   general terms, as we have formerly explained. [296]

   Here two observations must be made. First, we shall have just as much
   courage as the Lord shall give us; for we immediately lose heart, if he
   do not support us by his power. Secondly, it is the result of the
   righteous vengeance of God, that we are terrified by men, when he could
   not prevail upon us to fear him; that, when we have despised God's word
   and warnings, we fall down in terror at the words and threatenings of
   men. But we must also add, thirdly, God needs not extensive
   preparations to chastise us; for, if he lift up but a finger against
   us, we are undone. A small and feeble army will be sufficient to
   destroy us, even though we be well prepared, and have great numbers on
   our side. Next, he threatens that there will be no end to these
   calamities till they have been reduced to the last extremity, and
   until, amidst the frightful desolation of the earth, but few tokens of
   God's compassion are left.

   As the mast of a ship on the top of a mountain. This may be explained
   in two ways. Some consider the metaphor to be taken from trees which
   have been cut down; for, when a forest is cut down, lofty trees are
   left which may be of use for building ships. But hr, (har,) "a
   mountain," probably denotes also a rock or promontory, against which
   ships are dashed, and to which they adhere, and on which a "mast," the
   emblem of shipwreck, is afterwards seen. [297]

   As a banner on a hill. Another metaphor is now added, borrowed from
   trophies erected to commemorate the defeat of enemies. In short, the
   Prophet declares that they will be so few that all that remains shall
   be an indication of very great ruin. As if he had said, "This great
   multitude which you now have dazzles your eyes; but there will be such
   ruin and decrease that you shall no longer have the face of a people."
   We are thus reminded how humbly and modestly we ought to conduct
   ourselves, even though we have great wealth and numerous forces; for if
   our mind be puffed up, God will speedily beat down our pride, and
   render us more feeble and cowardly than women and children, so that we
   shall not be able to bear the sight even of a single enemy, and all our
   strength shall melt away like snow.

   18. Therefore will Jehovah wait. The Prophet now adds consolation; for
   hitherto he threatened to such an extent that almost all the godly
   might be thrown into despair. He intended therefore to soothe their
   minds, and encourage them to hope for better things, that they might
   embrace the mercy of God in the midst of those miseries, and might thus
   nourish their souls by his word. He contrasts this "waiting" with the
   excessive haste against which he spoke loudly at the beginning of the
   chapter, where he reproved the people for noisy haste, and condemned
   them for unbelief; but now, on the contrary, he reproaches them by
   saying that the Lord will not render like for like in consequence of
   the contempt with which they have treated him, and will not in that
   manner hasten to punish them. Others explain it, "He commands you to
   wait," or "he will cause you to wait." But the meaning which I have
   brought forward appears to me to be more appropriate.

   For Jehovah is a God of judgment. To make the former statement more
   plain, we must lay down this principle, that God exercises moderation
   in inflicting punishment, because he is inclined to mercy. This is what
   he means by the word "judgment;" for it denotes not only punishment,
   but also the moderation which is exercised in chastening. In like
   manner, Jeremiah says,

   "Chasten me, O Lord, but in judgment,
   not in thy wrath, lest thou crush me." (Jeremiah 10:24.)

   And again, I will not consume thee, but will chastise thee in judgment.
   [298] (Jeremiah 30:11.) "Judgment" is thus contrasted with severity,
   when the Lord observes a limit in punishing believers, that he may not
   ruin those whose salvation he always promotes; and, accordingly, as
   Habakkuk says, "in the midst of wrath he remembers his mercy."
   (Habakkuk 3:2.) He is not like us, therefore; he does not act with
   bustling or hurry, otherwise at every moment we must perish, but he
   calmly waits. Nor is it a slight confirmation of this when he adds,
   that God gives a proof of his glory by pardoning his people.

   And therefore will he be exalted, that he may be gracious to you.
   Others translate the words, "till he be gracious to you;" but I think
   that the former translation is more appropriate, and it agrees better
   with the meaning of the particle l (lamed.) The Lord appears to lie
   still or to sleep, so long as he permits his Church to be assailed by
   the outrages of wicked men; and the customary language of Scripture is
   to say that he sits, or lies unemployed, when he does not defend his
   Church. It might be thought that he lay still when he gave loose reins
   to the Chaldeans to oppress the Jews; and therefore the Prophet says,
   that the Lord will arise and ascend his judgment-seat. Why? "That he
   may be gracious to you."

   Blessed are all that wait for him. This is an inference from the former
   statement, in which he called Jehovah "a God of judgment." While he
   thus restrains himself, he draws from it an exhortation to patience and
   "waiting," and makes use of a part of the same verb, "wait," which he
   had formerly used. They were chargeable with distrust, and were
   distressed by strange uneasiness and restlessness of mind; for they
   were fearfully harassed by their unbelief, so that they could not
   "wait" for God calmly. To cure this vice, he enjoins them to "wait,"
   that is, to hope. Now, hope is nothing else than steadfastness of
   faith, that is, when we wait calmly till the Lord fulfil what he has
   promised. When he says that they who shall patiently "wait" for him
   will be "blessed," he declares, on the other hand, that they who allow
   themselves to be hurried away by impatience, and do not repent of their
   crimes and their wickedness, are wretched and miserable, and will at
   length perish; for without hope in God there can be no salvation or
   happiness.

   19. Surely the people in Zion shall dwell in Jerusalem. He confirms the
   former statement, that the people will indeed be afflicted, but will at
   length return to "Zion." Now, this might be thought incredible after
   the desolation of the city and of the whole country, for it seemed as
   if the whole nation had perished; yet Isaiah promises that the Church
   shall be preserved. He begins with Mount "Zion," on which the temple
   was built, and says that there men will henceforth call on the Lord. He
   likewise adds, "in Jerusalem," by which he means that the Church shall
   be enlarged and increased, and that all that had formerly been laid
   waste shall be restored. Yet he intimates that "Jerusalem" shall again
   be populous, because God had chosen it to be his sanctuary.

   Weeping thou shalt not weep. [299] The meaning is, that this mourning
   shall not be perpetual. The Church, that is, all believers, while they
   were in this wretched and distressed condition, must have been
   exceedingly sorrowful; but he says that those tears shall come to an
   end. To the same purport is it said by the Psalmist, "They who sow in
   tears shall reap in joy." (Psalm 126:5.) The Lord permits us indeed to
   be afflicted with great anguish; but at length he cheers us, and gives
   us reason for gladness, when he restores his Church; for that is the
   true joy of believers. Besides, as it is difficult to taste any
   consolation when the mind is overwhelmed by a conviction of God's
   vengeance, he holds out a ground of consolation in the mercy of God,
   because, when he is appeased, there is no reason to dread that joy and
   peace shall not immediately return. But, as the Prophet Habakkuk says
   in the passage already quoted, "in his wrath the Lord remembers mercy;"
   and he never punishes believers with such severity as not to restrain
   and moderate his strokes, and put a limit to his chastisements.
   (Habakkuk 3:2.)

   At the voice of thy cry. The Prophet points out the manner of obtaining
   pardon, in order to arouse believers to pray earnestly, and to
   supplicate with earnest groanings; for if there be no repentance, if we
   do not ask pardon from God, we are altogether unworthy of his mercy.
   If, therefore, we wish that the Church should be gathered together, and
   rescued from destruction by a kind of resurrection, let us cry to God
   to listen to our sighs and groanings; and if there be no sorrow of
   heart that excites us to prayer, we have no right to expect any
   alleviation.

   He will answer thee. This means nothing else than that he will give
   evidence of his kindness and aid; for the Lord "answers," not by word,
   but by deed. Yet let us not think that he will instantly comply with
   our wishes, which are often hasty and unseasonable. He will undoubtedly
   assist us when the proper time arrives, so that we shall know that he
   had in view our salvation.

   20. When the Lord shall have given you. He continues the same subject,
   and strengthens believers, that they may not faint; for patience
   springs from the hope of a more prosperous issue. Accordingly, he
   prepares them for enduring future chastisement, for the wrath of God
   will press hard on them for a time; but he immediately promises that a
   joyful issue awaits them, when they shall have endured those calamities
   and distresses; for God will restrain his severity. Thus, I consider v
   (vau) to mean "When" or "After;" as if he had said, "When you shall
   have endured those troubles, then will the Lord bless you; for he will
   change your condition for the better."

   Thy rain shall no longer be restrained. [300] The word mvrh (mOrEh) is
   viewed by some commentators as meaning "a teacher." But this does not
   agree with the context; for, although the chief fruit of our
   reconciliation to God is to have faithful "teachers," yet, as the
   ignorant multitude was more deeply affected by the want of food, Isaiah
   accommodates his language to their ignorance, and gives them a taste of
   God's fatherly kindness under the emblem of abundance of food.

   By the words "bread" and "water," he means extreme want and scarcity of
   all things, and therefore he calls it "bread of anguish and water of
   affliction." [301] Instead of this famine, he says that he will send
   them plenty and abundance. This is what he means by the word rain; for
   he describes the cause instead of the effect, as if he had said, "The
   earth shall yield fruit in abundance." This had a literal and special
   reference to a country, the fertility of which depended entirely on
   heaven; for it was not watered by rivers or fountains, but by rains.

   "The land whither ye go to possess it," says Moses, "is a land of hills
   and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven." (Deuteronomy
   11:11.)

   He declares that the fruits of the earth, which the Lord took away or
   diminished by barrenness, will return; because, in consequence of the
   copious "rains," [302] there will be large and abundant produce. Thus,
   when the Lord shall punish us, let us comfort our hearts with these
   statements and promises.

   21. Then shall thine ears hear. It was indeed no despicable promise
   which he made of an abundant produce of the fruits of the earth, but
   the chief ground of gladness and joy is, when God restores to us pure
   and sound doctrine; for no scarcity of wheat ought to terrify and alarm
   us so much as a scarcity of the word; and indeed, in proportion as the
   soul is more excellent than the body, so much the more ought we to
   dread this kind of famine, as another prophet also reminds us. (Amos
   8:11.) Isaiah promises this to the Jews as the most valuable of all
   blessings, that they shall be fed with the word, by the want of which
   they had formerly been heavily afflicted. The false prophets also boast
   of the word, and in a more haughty and disdainful manner than godly
   teachers: they wish to be reckoned and declared to be the best guides;
   but they lead men into error, and at length plunge them into
   destruction. But the word which points out the right path comes from
   God alone, though it would be of little service to us, if he did not
   also promise that he would give us ears; for otherwise he would speak
   to the deaf, and we should hear nothing but a confused sound.

   A word behind thee. These words must be extended so far as to mean that
   he will not permit what he speaks to us to be useless, but will
   inwardly move our understandings and hearts, so as to train them to
   true obedience; for by nature we are not willing to learn, and must be
   altogether formed anew by his Spirit. The word hear is very emphatic.
   He compares God to a schoolmaster, who places the children before his
   eyes, that he may more effectually train and direct them; by which he
   expresses the wonderful affection and care manifested towards us by
   God, who does not reckon it enough to go before us, but also "with his
   eye upon us gives us direction." (Psalm 32:8.) But the Prophet declares
   that they who follow God as their guide will be in no danger of going
   astray.

   Walk ye in it. This is an exhortation to cheerful progress, so that
   their journey may not be retarded, as frequently happens, by any
   uncertainty. What he adds, about the right hand and the left, might be
   thought absurd; for when Moses pointed out to the people the way in
   which they should walk, he at the same time charged them "not to turn
   aside to the right hand or to the left." (Deuteronomy 5:32; 17:20.) The
   road is straight and we ought not to seek any departures from it.

   What then does the Prophet mean? I reply, he uses the words "Right" and
   "Left" in a different sense; for he means by them every kind of
   transactions which we must undertake to perform. These are various, as
   there are also various modes of living; and every person meets with
   difficulties of many kinds, and is under the necessity of deliberating
   about them. By the "right and left hand," therefore, he means all the
   actions of human life, whatever they are, so that, in all that we
   undertake, we may have God for our guide, and may always regulate our
   transactions by his authority, whether we must go "to the right hand or
   to the left." And hence we derive very great consolation, that the Lord
   will favor our undertakings, and will direct our steps, to whatever
   hand we turn, provided only that we do not turn aside from the path
   which he points out to us.

   22. Then shall you profane the covering. This shews that the heavenly
   direction will not be without effect; for they will bid adieu to their
   errors, and devote their minds to the pure worship of God; and the
   Prophet expressly mentions the outward profession of true godliness, by
   which they will openly proclaim that they have renounced idolatry. For,
   since statues and images are instruments of idolatry and superstition,
   they who are truly converted to God detest and abhor them, and, as far
   as lies in their power, profane them as we read that Jehu did, who
   profaned the altars of Baal, and turned his temple into a common sewer.
   (2 Kings 10:27.) The example given by him and by others of the same
   class ought to be followed by godly princes and magistrates, if they
   wish to give a genuine proof of their repentance; for, although
   repentance is seated in the heart, and has God for a witness, it is
   shewn by its fruits. Isaiah has mentioned one class of them instead of
   the whole; for in general he shews that the proof of true repentance
   is, when men make it appear that they hold in abhorrence everything
   that is opposed to the worship of God. When he says that the idols are
   profaned, he does not mean that they were formerly sacred; for how
   could anything be sacred that dishonors God, and defiles men by its
   pollution? But, as men falsely imagine that they possess some
   sacredness, that is the reason why he says that they are "profaned,"
   and that they ought to be despised and rejected as things of no value
   and altogether unclean.

   The covering [303] of the graven images of thy silver. When he speaks
   of the "silver" and "gold" of the graven images, he means that no loss
   or damage prevents believers from abhorring the worship of idols. Such
   considerations restrain many from casting away idols altogether,
   because they see that "gold" or "silver" or something else is lost, and
   they choose rather to keep their idols than to sustain the smallest
   loss. Covetousness holds them in its net, so that they are more willing
   to sin of their own accord, and to pollute themselves with these
   abominations, than to lose this or that. But we ought to prefer the
   worship of God to everything else, to set little value on gold, to cast
   away pearls, and to loathe everything that is accounted precious,
   rather than defile ourselves with such crimes. In short, nothing can be
   so valuable that it ought not to be despised and reckoned worthless by
   us, when it comes into competition with overturning the kingdom of
   Satan and restoring the worship of God. In this manner we actually shew
   whether the love of God and of religion dwells in our hearts, when a
   sincere abhorrence of our wicked ignorance drives us to throw away all
   that is polluted.

   23. Then will he give rain to thy seed. From the fruit he again shews
   how desirable it is to be converted to God; for the fruit of repentance
   is, that he receives converted persons into favor, and bestows his
   blessing on them, so that they are in want of nothing, but, on the
   contrary, are loaded with every kind of blessings. As troubles and
   distresses proceed from the wrath of God, whom we provoke by our
   crimes, so, when he is pacified, everything goes on prosperously with
   us, and we obtain every sort of kindness, as the Law more fully
   testifies. (Leviticus 26:3-13; Deuteronomy 28:3-14.) A little before,
   he had spoken of "rain," from which they were led to expect an abundant
   supply of food; but because he had not observed order in beginning with
   earthly and fading blessings, he therefore now adds to doctrine, which
   is spiritual nourishment, those things which belong to the use of this
   corruptible life; for, although godliness has the promise of the
   present life as well as "of that which is to come," (1 Timothy 4:8,)
   yet first of all it aims at heaven. (Matthew 6:33.)

   Hence also let us learn that it is in vain for men to toil in
   cultivating their fields, if the Lord do not send rain from heaven. Our
   labors must be watered by him, and he must "give the increase;"
   otherwise they will be of no service. Yet we must not expect rain but
   from the blessing of God; and if we receive abundant produce, we ought
   to give to him the glory. Hence learn also that we shall be in want of
   nothing, and shall obtain very abundant fruits of our labors, if we are
   converted to God, and that it is our own fault that we often suffer
   poverty and want, because by our wickedness we drive away from us the
   blessing of God. Let us not therefore ascribe barrenness and famine to
   any other causes than to our own fault; for it is impossible that there
   should be so great a multitude of men as to be incapable of deriving
   support and nourishment from the earth; but by our iniquities and
   transgressions we shut the bosom of the earth, which would otherwise be
   laid open to us, and would abundantly yield fruits of every
   description, that we might lead a prosperous and happy life.

   And thy cattle shall feed. What he now adds about the "cattle" tends
   greatly to magnify the grace of God; for if his kindness overflows even
   on the dumb cattle, (Psalm 36:6,) how much more on men whom "he created
   after his image." (Genesis 1:27.) But we need not wonder if brute
   beasts, which were created for the use of men, suffer hunger along with
   their masters, and that they have a share in the bestowal of favor when
   God is reconciled to men.

   24. Thine oxen also. When he promises that the oxen and the asses shall
   eat abundant and clean provender, this is a repetition and confirmation
   of what was stated in the preceding verse. This passage is taken from
   the Law, (Deuteronomy 28:11,) and is gladly and frequently quoted by
   the prophets, in order that we may learn to discern in the sickness and
   death of cattle the indignation of God, and to desire more earnestly to
   be reconciled to him, that our houses may be filled with his goodness.

   25. And it shall come to pass. When the prophets describe the kingdom
   of Christ, they commonly draw metaphors from the ordinary life of men;
   for the true happiness of the children of God cannot be described in
   any other way than by holding out an image of those things which fall
   under our bodily senses, and from which men form their ideas of a happy
   and prosperous condition. It amounts therefore to this, that they who
   obey God, and submit to Christ as their king, shall be blessed. Now, we
   must not judge of this happiness from abundance and plenty of outward
   blessings, of which believers often endure scarcity, and yet do not on
   that account cease to be blessed. But those expressions are
   allegorical, and are accommodated by the Prophet to our ignorance, that
   we may know, by means of those things which are perceived by our
   senses, those blessings which have so great and surpassing excellence
   that our minds cannot comprehend them.

   And on every high hill there shall be streams. When he says that "on
   the mountains" there shall be "streams and rivulets," he gives a still
   more striking view of that plenty and abundance with which the Lord
   will enrich his people. Water is not plentiful on the peaks of the
   mountains, which are exceedingly dry; the valleys are indeed well
   moistened, and abound in water; but it is very uncommon for water to
   flow abundantly on the tops of the mountains. Yet the Lord promises
   that it shall be so, though it appear to be impossible; but by this
   mode of expression he foretells that, under the reign of Christ, we
   shall be happy in every respect, and that there will be no place in
   which there shall not be an abundant supply of blessings of every
   description; that nothing will be so barren as not to be rendered
   fruitful by his kindness, so that everywhere we may be happy. This is
   what we should actually experience, if we were fully under the
   authority of Christ. We should plainly see his blessing on all sides,
   if we sincerely and honestly obeyed him; everything would go on to our
   wish; and the whole world and everything in it would contribute to our
   comfort; but, because we are very far from yielding that obedience, we
   have only a slight taste of those blessings, and enjoy them so far as
   we have advanced in newness of life.

   By the day of slaughter, is denoted another mark of the divine favor,
   that God will keep his people safe and sound against the violence of
   enemies; and in this way the Prophet gives credibility to the former
   prediction; for otherwise it would have been difficult to believe that
   captives and exiles would enjoy such prosperity. Here he speaks
   therefore of the slaughter of the wicked; as if he had said, "The Lord
   will not only do you good, but will also drive out your enemies." It is
   generally thought that the Prophet now speaks of the defeat which
   befell the wicked king Sennacherib when he besieged Jerusalem. (2 Kings
   19:35; Isaiah 37:36.) But when I examine it more closely, I am more
   disposed to view this passage as referring to the destruction of
   Babylon; for although a vast multitude of persons was slain, when
   Sennacherib was shamefully put to flight, yet still the people were not
   delivered. This reminds us that we ought not to despair, even though
   our enemies be very numerous, and have abundance of garrisons, troops,
   and fortifications; for the Lord can easily put them to flight and
   defend his Church. Let us not be terrified at their power or rage, or
   be discouraged because we are few in number; for neither their troops,
   nor their bulwarks, nor their rage and insolence, will hinder them from
   falling into the hands of God.

   26. And the light of the moon shall be. The Prophet was not satisfied
   with describing an ordinary state of prosperity, without adding
   something extraordinary; for he says that the Lord will go beyond the
   course of nature in this kindness and liberality. It never happened
   that the brightness of "the sun" was increased, unless when "the sun"
   stood still in the days of Joshua, in order to give time for pursuing
   the enemies, (Joshua 10:12,13,) and when, for the sake of Hezekiah, the
   dial went backward. (2 Kings 20:11; Isaiah 38:8.) But on this occasion
   nothing is said about those miracles. [304] Besides, the Prophet does
   not speak about prolonging the course of "the sun" above our horizon,
   but about increasing its brightness sevenfold. He shews what will be
   the condition of the godly under the reign of Christ; for in other
   respects the Lord

   "maketh his sun to shine on the bad as well as on the good." (Matthew
   5:45.)

   But here he speaks of happiness in which ungodly men can have no share.
   There is one kind of liberality which is bestowed indiscriminately on
   all, and another kind which is peculiar to believers alone; as it is
   said, "Great is the abundance of thy goodness which thou hast laid up
   for them that fear thee." (Psalm 31:19.) Isaiah speaks of this special
   favor, [305] and, in order to describe it, borrows metaphors from
   well-known objects. Accordingly, he declares that God will enlighten
   believers with so great brightness that, if "seven" suns were brought
   together, their brightness would be far inferior to this.

   When the Lord shall have bound up the breach of his people. That the
   weight of afflictions, by which the people were soon afterwards
   overwhelmed, might not hinder them from believing this statement, he
   likewise adds another promise, that the Lord will be like a physician
   to heal their wounds. Hence it follows, that the people must be
   chastened, and, in some measure, prepared for repentance by wounds, and
   must even be crushed and bruised in such a manner as to be reduced
   almost to nothing.

   And healed the stroke of their wound. What he now adds about a
   "stroke," is intended to shew that this bruising will not be slight;
   for it resembles a body beaten and wounded by many strokes. If
   therefore we shall be ready at any time to think that the Lord deals
   harshly with us, let us call to remembrance those predictions, that the
   Lord will "bind up our wounds," which otherwise might appear to be
   mortal. And if any one ask why the Lord chastises his people so
   severely, I reply, that it produces no good effect on us when he treats
   us mildly; our vices are deeply rooted, and adhere to our very marrow,
   and cannot be separated but by a razor which has a sharp and keen edge.

   27. Behold the name of the Lord cometh. He threatens the destruction of
   the Assyrians, who were at that time the chief enemies of the Church.
   From almost all their neighbors, indeed, the Jews received annoyance;
   but as the Assyrians were greatly superior to others in wealth and
   power, so the prophets, when they speak of enemies, mention them almost
   exclusively, and afterwards the Babylonians, who obtained the monarchy;
   though, as we have already seen, they frequently, by a figure of speech
   in which a part is taken for the whole, include the Chaldeans under the
   name of Assyrians. By "the name of God" he unquestionably means God
   himself; but he makes use of this circumlocution, because the Assyrians
   and other nations worshipped gods made of gold and silver, and held up
   the Jews to ridicule, because they did not worship him under any image,
   or statue, or resemblance; as one who wrote against them says that
   "they worship the bright clouds and the deity of the sky." [306] Thus
   wicked and ungodly men always judge of God according to outward
   appearances; while the prophets, on the other hand, remind believers of
   "the name of God." "That God who revealed himself to you by his name,
   whom you do not feel, whom you do not see, will take vengeance on your
   insults."

   From afar. He adds this as if he granted what was said by them; for
   ungodly men, when they do not perceive the hand of God, think that he
   is at a great distance, and mock at the confidence of believers as
   groundless. Accordingly, the Prophet, adapting his language to the
   views of unbelievers, shews that God, whom they thought to be at a
   great distance, will come, or rather, has already come, and is at hand.
   This is what he means by the particle hnh, (hInnEh,) behold, which he
   contrasts with the word mmrhq, (mImmErhok,) "from afar," directing
   believers, in this manner, to rise above all obstructions, that by
   their hope they may arrive at that assistance which he promised.

   His face burneth. In order to shew that the celebration of the name of
   God in Judea is not vain or groundless, the Prophet describes the power
   of God, that is, the power which he will employ in driving out the
   enemies of the Church, as dreadful. When he addresses those who believe
   in him, in order to encourage them to the exercise of faith, he shews
   himself to be kind, gentle, patient, slow to anger, and merciful; but
   to the ungodly he holds out nothing but fear and terror. (Exodus 34:6.)
   And as the ungodly are terrified when God is mentioned, so believers,
   drawn by a conviction of his goodness, rely on him, and are not
   distressed by such fears. This shews us that we ought continually to
   persevere in the fear of God, that we may not find God to be what he is
   here described by the Prophet.

   His burden is heavy. [307] That is, the Lord will bring with him
   dreadful calamities, which the ungodly will not be able to endure; for
   by "burdens" he means the punishments which are inflicted on the
   ungodly. He expresses the same thing by the words lips and tongue. But
   why did he speak of them rather than of the hands? It is, because
   ungodly men mock at all the threatenings which are uttered by the word
   of God, and treat as fabulous all that is declared by the prophets. To
   their own cost, therefore, they shall learn that the sound which
   proceedeth from the sacred name of God is not without meaning, and is
   not idle thunder intended merely to strike the ears, but shall at
   length know by experience what is the power of that word which they
   despised.

   28. And his Spirit. [308] He proceeds with that threatening which he
   had begun to utter, namely, that the Church will indeed be chastised,
   but yet that the Assyrians shall utterly perish; for he says that they
   will be plunged into the deep by the "Spirit" of God, or rather, that
   the "Spirit" himself is like a deep torrent which shall swallow them
   up. Others translate rvh, [309] (ruach,) by "blowing," and think that
   the allusion is to a storm or violent wind.

   And with a useless sieve. The next metaphor employed is that of a
   "sieve," which is very frequent in Scripture (Matthew 3:12.) He says
   that he will shake the Assyrians with a sieve, in order to thrash and
   scatter them; and therefore he calls it "the sieve of vanity," that is,
   a useless sieve, [310] intended not to preserve, but to destroy; for,
   in another sense, the Lord is wont to "sift" his own people also, so as
   to gather them like good grain into the barn.

   And a bridle causing to err. [311] The third metaphor is that of a
   "bridle," by which the Lord continually restrains the pride and
   rebelliousness of wicked men, and, in a word, shews that he is their
   Judge. True, indeed, the Lord commonly restrains and subdues his own
   people by a "bridle," but it is in order to bring them to obedience;
   while, on the other hand, he restrains wicked men in such a manner as
   to cast them down headlong to destruction. This is what he means by the
   phrase "causing to err." As furious horses are driven about in all
   directions by their riders, and, the more they kick are more violently
   struck and beaten; so the ungodly, when they are kept back, rush
   eagerly in the opposite direction, as it is beautifully described by
   David. (Psalm 32:9.)

   The object of these metaphors is to shew that we must not sport with
   the Lord; for, although he appear for a time to act differently, we
   shall at length know by experience the truth of what the Prophet says,
   that his "breath" alone will be like a torrent to cast down the wicked,
   that they may be suddenly overwhelmed. Next, when he gives warning that
   the nations shall be winnowed with "a useless sieve," we ought to fear
   lest the Lord, if he find in us nothing but chaff, throw us on the
   dunghill. Lastly, we must observe the difference that exists between
   the children of God and the reprobate; for the Lord chastises both, but
   in different ways -- the children of God, that they may be purified and
   preserved -- and the reprobate, that they may be cast down headlong and
   destroyed.

   29. And you shall have a song as in the night. Here he declares that
   all the punishments which he threatened against the Assyrians shall
   tend to the advantage of the Church, because the Lord punishes the
   outrages committed against his people not less severely than if they
   had been committed against himself. In this way he testifies his
   infinite love and kindness towards his own people, when he deigns to
   take up arms on their behalf. Hence we ought to conclude, that all the
   threatenings which are found in any part of Scripture tend to the
   consolation of believers.

   When a festival is kept. He says that this "song" will be sacred, and
   compares it to a "holy solemnity," in order to excite believers to
   thankfulness, and to shew that their joy should be directed to God; for
   it is not enough to rejoice, unless our joy look straight towards God,
   and unless we keep him alone always in our view; otherwise our joy will
   be fruitless and irreligious, and will not promote our salvation, or be
   acceptable to God. He calls it "a song of the night," because the Jews
   began the day at sunset, and, as soon as the evening came, celebrated
   the festival.

   To the mountain. He explains more fully of what nature this joy shall
   be. They shall not dance, as irreligious men do, but shall raise and
   fix their eyes on God, whom they acknowledge to be the author of every
   blessing. By "the mountain" he means the temple which was built "on the
   mountain." He calls God The Mighty One of Israel, because it was by his
   assistance that they had been redeemed and preserved; and hence he
   reminds them that in future they will not be safe in any other way than
   by placing their hope in God alone. And indeed, when we cherish any
   conviction of our own strength, we rob God of this title, which is
   truly and sincerely bestowed on him by none but the lowly and humble,
   who have laid aside all confidence in their own strength.

   30. And Jehovah shall cause to be heard. He confirms what he formerly
   said about the judgment of God on the Assyrians, and he describes it
   figuratively, as is very customary both with himself and with the other
   prophets. When God delays, and does not immediately punish the wicked,
   we think that he is either asleep or not powerful, and are distracted
   by doubt and uncertainty. And if we behold some of his judgments, yet
   such is our natural stupidity, or rather our ingratitude, that we keep
   before us those masks which hinder us from perceiving the glory of God;
   for we ascribe it to fortune, or to the plans and contrivances and
   strength of men, and never, unless when we are compelled, acknowledge
   that we owe anything to God.

   The power of his voice. [312] For the reasons now stated, the Prophet
   was not satisfied with having once foretold the vengeance of God
   against the Assyrians; but he likewise describes it in a lively manner,
   and repeats it with great earnestness. He declares that the destruction
   shall be such that men will be constrained to hear "the voice of God;"
   that is, to acknowledge his judgment, and to confess that this calamity
   hath proceeded from him, as if he had spoken openly. The matter,
   therefore, may be thus summed up. The event will be so manifest, that
   there shall be no one who does not understand that this calamity
   proceeded from "the mouth," that is, from the decree of God.

   And the descent of his arm shall he cause to be seen. He begins with
   "the voice of God," that we may know that he directs by his authority
   everything that is done on the earth. Yet at the same time he applauds
   the power of his doctrine, on which it was necessary that his people
   should rely, in order that the effect might be openly displayed at the
   proper time. But as the work quickly follows the decree and "voice of
   God," he adds "the descent of his arm." These two things ought always
   to be joined together; for we ought not to imagine that God is like
   men, or that he suddenly undertakes anything, and then leaves it
   defective or incomplete. Whatever he has decreed he likewise executes,
   and his hand can never be separated from his mouth. On the other hand,
   he executes nothing at random, but all must have been previously
   decreed, so that all the punishments which he inflicts are so many
   displays of righteous judgment.

   With deluge and hailstone. That vengeance is illustrated, in the
   conclusion of the verse, by figures, in order that its terrific
   character may lead the Jews more cheerfully to raise their faith on
   high; for it was highly consolatory to them to know that, though they
   were heavily afflicted, a far more dreadful judgment would soon fall on
   their enemies. And yet we must not dream, as the Rabbins do, that the
   Assyrians were struck by a thunderbolt, for their conjecture is
   excessively frivolous. On the contrary, the Prophet follows the
   ordinary custom, and, by means of these comparisons, describes the
   judgment of God, which our prodigious dulness makes us excessively slow
   to comprehend. Conflagrations, thunderbolts, inundations, and deluges,
   are somewhat unusual and monstrous events, and thus produce a stronger
   impression on our own minds. For this reason, the prophets draw a
   comparison from them, that men may perceive the dreadful and avenging
   hand of God against the wicked.

   31. Surely by the voice of Jehovah. He added this for two reasons;
   first, to shew why the Assyrian must be bruised; for, since he was
   cruel and savage to others, it is proper that

   "the same measure which he meted should be measured to him again."
   (Matthew 7:2.)

   This is the ordinary judgment of God against tyrants, as the Prophet
   says in a subsequent passage of this book,

   "Woe to thee that spoilest, for thou shalt be spoiled." (Isaiah 33:1.)

   The second reason is, because the power of the Assyrian king appeared
   to be so great that he could not fall. Although, therefore, he was
   fortified on every hand, not only to defend himself, but also to attack
   others, yet the Prophet says, that "by the voice of God" alone he shall
   be bruised. Hence we learn how groundless is the confidence of wicked
   men, who rely on their garrisons and arms, and presumptuously despise
   God, as if they had not been liable to his judgment. But in order to
   destroy them, the Lord will have no need of any other arms than his own
   "voice;" for by the slightest expression of his will he will lay them
   low. Nor can it be doubted that the Prophet intends to withdraw the
   minds of believers from earthly means, that they may not inquire how it
   shall be done, but may be satisfied with the bare promise of God, who
   is fully able to execute his word as soon as it has gone forth from
   him.

   32. And there shall be in every passage. He means that the Assyrians
   will in vain try every method of escaping from the hand of God; for
   wherever they go, whether they attempt to go forward or to turn back,
   the hand of God shall pursue them. As to the phrase, fastened staff,
   [313] I readily adopt the opinion of those who think that the metaphor
   is taken from those on whom have been inflicted strokes so heavy, that
   the marks of the instrument of punishment remain, as if a rod or staff
   were "fastened" in the wound. It will perhaps be thought preferable to
   interpret it to mean, that the wound is "fastened" [314] on the
   Assyrian, as a foundation is fixed in the earth; for what is not
   "fastened" may be moved out of its place and carried away. But he shews
   that that wound is so deeply fixed that it cannot be shaken off or
   removed. In like manner, the weight of God's wrath lies on the
   reprobate, and holds them weighed down to the end. To shew that there
   is no hope of being able to derive advantage from a change of place, he
   says everywhere, thus declaring that there shall be no retreat. The
   clause ought to be thus arranged, "wherever the staff shall pass, there
   it will stick firmly."

   With tabrets and harps. He means that the issue of the battle will not
   be doubtful, as when the combatants meet on equal terms; for he says
   that the victory will be certain; because, as soon as God determines to
   go forth to fight, he already holds the victory in his hand. "Tabrets
   and harps," hands spread out and lifted up, are expressive of the joy
   of conquerors, when they shout aloud and chant the song of victory.

   Shall fight against her. The feminine pronoun vh (bahh) is viewed by
   some commentators as referring to the army; but the Prophet undoubtedly
   intended to express something higher, namely, the head of the army,
   that is, Babylon, as contrasted with Jerusalem, which also he formerly
   denoted by a similar pronoun.

   From these statements we ought to infer, that the wicked shall at
   length be destroyed, though they appear to have many means of escape;
   for wherever they turn, whatever road they take, the "staff" of the
   Lord shall pursue them, and shall ever remain "fastened" to their back;
   they shall never escape his hand or get quit of their wounds. We, too,
   are chastened by the hand of God, but the wounds do not always last;
   our pains are soothed and abated, and "our grief is turned into joy."
   (John 16:20.) Besides, God carries on war against the reprobate in such
   a manner that they cannot resist him, or gain anything by their
   attempts. He joins battle with them, indeed, but it is as a conqueror;
   he even allows them to obtain some advantages, but represses their
   insolence whenever he thinks proper. If, therefore, we fight under his
   banner, let us entertain no doubt of obtaining the victory; for, when
   we have him as our leader, we shall be safe from all danger, and shall
   undoubtedly come off conquerors.

   33. For Tophet is ordained. The Prophet goes on to threaten the
   vengeance of God, and says that not only a temporary calamity, but also
   everlasting destruction awaits the wicked; for hell is prepared for
   them, and not merely for persons of ordinary rank, but likewise for the
   king himself and the nobles. By "Tophet" he unquestionably means Hell;
   not that we must fancy to ourselves some place in which the wicked are
   shut up, as in a prison, after their death, in order to endure the
   torments which they deserve; but it denotes their miserable condition
   and excruciating torments. In the book of Kings, it denotes that place
   where the Jews sacrificed their children to the idol Moloch. (2 Kings
   23:10.) It is also mentioned by Jeremiah, (Jeremiah 19:6;) and that
   place was destroyed and profaned by Josiah on account of the detestable
   superstition committed in it. (2 Kings 23:10.) The prophets, I have no
   doubt, intended to give the name of this place to the punishments and
   torments of the wicked, in order that the bare mention of it might
   excite horror in godly persons, and that idolatry might be universally
   regarded with greater abhorrence. The word "Gehenna" [315] has the same
   etymology; for "the Valley of Hinnom" was a name given to Hell
   (Gehenna) on account of the abominable sacrilege practiced in it.

   Since yesterday. [316] When we see that all goes well with the wicked,
   and that they have everything to their wish, we think that they will
   pass unpunished. For this reason the Prophet, on the contrary,
   exclaims: "Since yesterday, that is, of old since the beginning of the
   world, the Lord hath determined what punishments he shall inflict on
   them." Though this decree is still hidden from us, yet it must be
   certain, and cannot fail. Let us not, therefore, judge of the lot of
   the wicked according to outward appearances; let us wait for the Lord,
   who in due time will execute his righteous judgment. Yet let us not be
   rash, or think that God hath forgotten to take vengeance; for he had
   determined what he should do before it could enter into our mind; nor
   can we so speedily desire the destruction of the wicked as not to have
   our thoughts and desires anticipated long before by the Lord, for from
   the beginning he determined to inflict on them punishments and
   torments. Some think that it is a parallel passage to that of the
   Apostle, "Christ yesterday, to-day, and for ever." (Hebrews 13:8.) But
   I consider "yesterday" to be here used simply as contrasted with our
   thoughts, that we may not think that we possess so much wisdom as to be
   capable of anticipating God: for there is nothing sudden in his
   purposes, but all were long ago settled and determined by him. He
   speaks of the punishments of the life to come, as I have already said,
   that is, of the punishments which the wicked shall endure, in addition
   to the distresses which they suffer in this life. On this subject it is
   strange that the Sadducees (Matthew 22:23; Acts 23:8) were so dull and
   stupid as to confine rewards and punishments within the limits of this
   life, as if the judgment of God did not extend beyond this world; for
   the modes of expression which immediately follow would not apply to
   temporal punishments, and the very name "Tophet," taken metaphorically,
   could denote nothing else than God's highest curse.

   Yea, for the king it is prepared. He shews that not even "kings," who
   are supposed to be entitled, on account of their majesty and power, to
   enjoy some peculiar privilege, are exempted from this punishment. Their
   greatness dazzles the eyes of men, but will yield them no defense, so
   as to prevent the Lord from punishing them as they deserve.

   He says that the slaughter of them will be in a deep place, that we may
   know that they cannot escape or be rescued from it; and he calls hell
   broad, that we may know that however numerous they may be, though they
   all conspire together, they shall likewise perish; for the Lord will
   not be exhausted by punishing, and he will have a place so large as to
   contain all his enemies.

   The pile of it is fire. He speaks metaphorically concerning the
   destruction of the reprobate, which otherwise we cannot sufficiently
   comprehend, in the same manner as we do not understand the blessed and
   immortal life, unless it be shadowed out by some figures adapted to our
   capacity. Hence it is evident how foolish and absurd the sophists are,
   who enter into subtle arguments about the nature and quality of that
   fire, and torture themselves by giving various explanations of it. Such
   gross imaginations must be banished, since we know that the Prophet
   speaks figuratively; and in another passage (Isaiah 66:24) we shall see
   that "fire" and the "worm" are joined together.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [284] See Commentary on Isaiah, [37]vol. 1 p. 75. ^FT541 The phrase
   lnsk mskh (lInsOch massechah) has been variously explained. The Peshito
   makes it mean to pour out libations, probably with reference to some
   ancient mode of ratifying covenants, and the Septuagint accordingly
   translates it epoiesate sunthe'kas, you made covenants.' Cocceius
   applies it to the casting of molten images, (ad fundendum fusile,) De
   Dieu to the molding of designs or plots. Kimchi and Calvin derive the
   words from the root to cover, and suppose the idea here expressed to be
   that of concealment. Ewald follows J. D. Michaelis in making the phrase
   mean to weave a web, which agrees well with the context, and is favored
   by the similar use of the same verb and noun in Isaiah 25:7. Knobel's
   objection, that this figure is suited only to a case of treachery, has
   no force, as the act of seeking foreign aid was treasonable under the
   theocracy, and the design appears to have been formed and executed
   secretly. (Compare Isaiah 29:15, where the reference may be to the same
   transaction.)" -- Alexander ^FT542 See [38]page 345 ^FT543 The allusion

   is rendered in a strong idiomatic form by Hitzig, (verschmitztheit,
   craftiness,) and Ewald, (querwege, crossway.) -- Alexander. Luther's
   term, (muthwillen, wantonness,) conveys the same general idea. -- Ed
   ^FT548 See Commentary on John's Gospel, [40]vol. 1 p. 223 note 1.
   ^FT549 "Estans pleins de vent;" -- "Being full of wind." ^FT550 Here
   the Author departs from his usual manner, by omitting all mention of
   the concluding and highly expressive clause of the verse. "For gvh,
   (gEbEh,) the English version has pit,' Lowth, cistern,' and most other
   writers well;' but in Ezekiel 47:11, it denotes a marsh' or pool.'
   Ewald supposes a particular allusion to the breaking of a poor man's
   earthen pitcher, an idea which had been suggested long before by Gill:
   as poor people are wont to do, to take fire from the hearth, and water
   out of a well in a piece of broken pitcher.'" -- Alexander. All must
   admit, that when one cannot find a "sherd" fit for the meanest purpose,
   the vessel is broken in pieces. -- Ed ^FT551 Jarchi says, that in this
   passage svvh (shubah) "signifies rest and quietness," and adduces as a
   parallel passage one in which the word is commonly viewed as the
   imperative of svv, (shub,) with He paragogic. "Give rest, O Lord, to
   the many thousands of Israel." (Numbers 10:36.) Breithaupt supports
   that interpretation, and derives the word from ysv, (yashab,) "to sit,
   to rest." -- Ed ^FT552 See Commentary on Isaiah, [41]vol. 1 p. 29
   ^FT553 "trn (tOrEn) is taken as the name of a tree by Augusti
   (Tannenbaum, the fir-tree) and Rosenmüller, (pinus, the pine-tree,) by
   Gesenius and Ewald as a signal or a signal-pole. In the only two cases
   where it occurs elsewhere, it has the specific meaning of a mast. The
   allusion may be simply to the similar appearance of a lofty and
   solitary tree, or the common idea may be that of a flag-staff, which
   might be found in either situation. The word Beacon,' here employed by
   Gataker and Barnes, is consistent neither with the Hebrew nor the
   English usage." -- Alexander ^FT554 The latter quotation may appear to
   be inaccurate, for in the English version it runs thus, "I will correct
   thee in measure;" but Calvin adheres closely to the Hebrew original,
   which employs in both passages the word mspht (mIsphat) "judgment." --
   Ed ^Ft555 "Thou shalt weep no more." -- Eng. Ver. ^FT556 "Yet shall not
   thy teachers be removed." -- Eng. Ver. ^FT557 "Though ye find
   yourselves reduced to extremities usual in long sieges, though ye be
   stinted to a short allowance of bread and water,' and are forced to
   undergo a great many other inconveniences, yet use not my prophets ill,
   make them not to run into corners to hide themselves from the violence
   of an impatient multitude; but be glad to see them among you, and let
   their examples encourage you to bear up handsomely under the short
   afflictions which shall then be upon you. This is the plain meaning of
   the words, without running to the whimsical expositions of some who by
   Panis Angustiæ,' as the Vulgate renders lchm tsr (lEchEm tzar,) make
   the prophet mean the compendious doctrine of the gospel, or Christ
   himself, or the eucharist, and like dreams." -- Samuel White ^FT558
   "Kimchi's explanation of the word (mvrh, mOrEh, or rather mvrym,
   mOrim,) as meaning the early rain, (which sense it has in Joel 2:23,
   and perhaps also in Psalm 84:6,) has been retained only by Calvin and
   Lowth. The great majority of writers adhere not only to the sense of
   teacher,' but to the plural import of the form, (mvrym with 2 Sing.
   Affix.,) and understand the word as a designation or description of the
   prophets, with particular reference, as some suppose, to their
   reappearance after a period of severe persecution or oppression." --
   Alexander ^FT559 "The ephods of your molten images, -- short cassocks,
   without sleeves, with which the heathens adorned their idols." --
   Stock. Cicero tells a story about Dionysius, who found in the temple of
   Jupiter Olympius a golden cloak of great weight, with which the statue
   of Jupiter had been ornamented by Gelo out of the spoils of the
   Carthaginians, and, after making the witty observation that it was too
   heavy for summer and too cold for winter, carried it off, and threw
   around the statue a woolen mantle, which, he said, was adapted to every
   season of the year. (Cic. de Nat. Deor. l. iii.) -- Ed ^FT560 "De his."
   "De ces miracles-là." ^FT561 "Isaie parle de ceste faveur speciale."
   ^FT562 "Qui puras nubes, et coeli numen adorant." ^FT563 "And the
   burden thereof (or, And the grievousness of flame) shall be heavy." --
   Eng. Ver. "And heavy the column of flame." -- Stock. "And the burning
   is heavy: for so ought we to translate ms'h, (massaah,) in the same
   sense as in Judges 20:40, and in other passages, from ns', (nasa,) to
   lift up,' because flame and smoke naturally ascend." -- Rosenmüller

   that mth (matteh,) with Tzere instead of Segol, is in the construct

   denotes the divine determination or decree, and that the whole phrase
   means the rod appointed by him, or, to put it in a form at once exact
   and poetical, the rod of destiny or doom." Diodati's Italian version

   CHAPTER 31
     __________________________________________________________________

   Isaiah 31:1-9

   1. Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, and stay on horses, and
   trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they
   are very strong: but they look not to the Holy One of Israel, neither
   seek the Lord!

   1. Væ descendentibus in Ægyptum ad auxilium, et qui equis innituntur;
   et qui curribus confidunt, quia multi sunt; et equitibus, quia
   prævalidi; et non respexerunt ad Sanctum Israel, nec Iehovam
   inquisierunt.

   2. Yet he is also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back
   his words: but will arise against the house of evil-doers, and against
   the help of them that work iniquity.

   2. Atqui ipse quoque sapiens est. Itaque adducet malum, nec verba sua
   faciet irrita; insurgent, inquam, contra domum malignorum, et contra
   auxilium opificum vanitatis.

   3. Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and
   not spirit. When the Lord shall stretch out his hand, both he that
   helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they
   shall fail together.

   3. Et certe Ægyptius homo est, non Deus; et equi eorum caro, et non
   spiritus. Itaque simulac extenderit Iehova manum suam, ruet auxiliator,
   et cadet adjutus, omnesque simul deficient.

   4. For thus hath the Lord spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the
   young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called
   forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase
   himself for the noise of them: so shall the Lord of hosts come down to
   fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.

   4. Quoniam sic dixit Iehova ad me: Ut leo rugit et catulus leonis ad
   prædam suam, contra quem si convocetur coetus pastorum, a clamore eorum
   non commovebitur, neque ob eorum tumultum humiliabitur; sic descendet
   Iehova exercituum ad præliandum pro monte Sion, et pro colle ejus.

   5. As birds flying, so will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem;
   defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will preserve it

   5. Sicut aves quæ volant, ita proteget Iehova exercituum Ierusalem;
   protegens liberabit, transiliens servabit.

   6. Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply
   revolted.

   6. Revertimini ut profundam fecistis defectionem, filii Israel.

   7. For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and
   his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin.

   7. Quoniam in die illa abjicit homo idola argenti sui, et idola auri
   sui, quæ fecerunt vobis manus vestræ peccatum.

   8. Then shall the Assyrians fall with the sword, not of a mighty man;
   and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee
   from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited.

   8. Tum cadet Assur per gladium, non viri; et gladius non hominis
   devorabit eum; et fuga sibi consulet a facie gladii, et juvens ejus in
   liquefactionem erunt.

   9. And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes
   shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the Lord, whose fire is in Zion,
   and his furnace in Jerusalem.

   9. In arcem suam præ formidine transibit, et pavebunt Principes ejus a
   vexillo, dicit Iehova, cui ignis est (vel, qui ignis illi est) in Sion,
   et cui fornax in Ierusalem.


   1. Woe to them that go down to Egypt. He again returns to the subject
   which he had handled at the beginning of the former chapter; for he
   still cries loudly against the Jews, whose ordinary custom it was, in
   seasons of danger, to resort, not to the Lord, but to the Egyptians. We
   have formerly explained why this was so highly displeasing to God. To
   state the matter briefly, there are two reasons why the Prophet
   reproves this crime so severely. The first is, because it is impossible
   for us to place confidence for our salvation in creatures, and at the
   same time in God; for our eyes must be withdrawn from him as soon as
   they are directed to them. The second reason is, God had expressly
   forbidden them to enter into alliance with the Egyptians. (Deuteronomy
   17:16.) To sinful confidence was added rebelliousness, as if they had
   resolved to provide for their safety by despising God, and by
   disobeying his will.

   We must therefore look at the source of this evil, if we wish to
   understand fully the Prophet's meaning. There was also a peculiar
   reason, as we have formerly remarked, why the Lord wished the Jews to
   have no intercourse with the Egyptians. It was, lest that wicked
   alliance should obliterate the remembrance of the redemption from
   Egypt, and lest they should be corrupted by the superstitions and
   sinful idolatry of the Egyptians. Yet these arguments were regarded by
   them as of no weight; and, though God had forbidden it, this did not
   hinder them from continually applying to them for assistance, and
   imagining that their assistance was a shield which defended them
   against the arm of God. Consequently, there are good reasons why the
   Prophet exclaims so earnestly against such madness. Even on the ground
   that God had forbidden it, their "going down into Egypt" deserved to be
   severely blamed; but it was still more intolerably criminal, that by
   false confidence they bestowed on mortal men the glory which was due to
   God. In order to make it still more clear that in this manner they
   defraud God of his right, he not only accuses them of having relied on
   the Egyptians, but likewise brings a charge against them, on the other
   hand, that

   They have not looked to the Holy One of Israel. Here appears more
   clearly the reason why that treachery of the Jews is so sharply
   reproved by Isaiah; for in other respects God does not disapprove of
   our using lawful remedies, just as we eat bread and other kinds of food
   which were intended for our use. Thus if any person, placed in danger,
   employ means which were not forbidden, but which are customary and
   lawful, provided that he do not at all deny the power of God, he
   certainly ought not to be blamed; but if we are so strongly attached to
   outward means, that we do not at the same time seek God, and if,
   through distrust of his promises, we resort to unlawful methods, this
   is worthy of condemnation and abhorrence.

   The word look is frequently employed in Scripture to denote this
   confidence; for we commonly turn our eyes towards that quarter from
   which we expect assistance. In a word, we are here taught that we ought
   to place our trust for salvation in none other than in God alone, that,
   relying on his promises, we may boldly ask from him whatever is
   desirable. He undoubtedly permits us to use all things which he
   intended for our use, but in such a manner that our minds must be
   entirely fixed on him.

   When he calls God "the Holy One of Israel," he presents in a striking
   light the wickedness and ingratitude of the people, who, after having
   been taken under God's protection and guardianship, despised such a
   protector and guardian of their salvation, and ran eagerly after their
   own lusts. By immediately adding, neither have they sought Jehovah, he
   shews that neither the power, nor the goodness, nor the fatherly
   kindness of God, could keep them in the discharge of their duty. In the
   present day, since he invites us not less kindly to come to him, we
   offer a grievous insult to him if we look to any other, and do not
   resolve to trust in him alone; and everything that shall turn away and
   withdraw our minds from God will be to us like "Egypt."

   2. Yet he also is wise. By calling God "wise," he does not merely
   bestow on him the honor of an attribute which always belongs to him,
   but censures the craftiness of those whom he saw to be too much
   delighted with their own wisdom. He said a little before, (Isaiah
   29:15,) that they "dug caves for themselves," when they thought that,
   by hidden plans and secret contrivances, they avoided and deceived the
   eyes of God. He now pours witty ridicule on this madness, by affirming
   that, on the other hand, wisdom belongs also to God; indirectly
   bringing against them the charge of believing that they could shut
   God's mouth as not knowing their affairs. As if he had said, "What
   shall become of your wisdom?" Will the effect of it be that God shall
   cease to be "wise?" On the contrary, by reproving your vanity, he will
   give practical demonstration that "he taketh the wise in their own
   craftiness." (Job 5:13;1 Corinthians 3:19.)

   We may draw from this a general doctrine, that they who shelter
   themselves under craftiness and secret contrivances, gain nothing but
   to provoke still more the wrath of God. A bad conscience always flees
   from the judgment of God, and seeks lurking-places to conceal itself.
   Wicked men contrive various methods of guarding and fortifying
   themselves against God, and think that they are wise and circumspect,
   even though they be covered only with empty masks; while others,
   blinded by their elevated rank, despise God and his threatenings. Thus,
   by declaring that "God is also wise," the Prophet wounds them painfully
   and sharply, that they may not lay claim to so great craftiness as to
   be capable of imposing on God by their delusions.

   He will arise against the house of the evil-doers. As they did not
   deserve that he should reason with them, he threatens that they shall
   feel that God has his arguments at his command, for ensnaring
   transgressors. First, they did not think that God has sufficient
   foresight, because he did not, according to the ordinary practice of
   the world, provide for their safety amidst so great dangers, and
   because they considered all threatenings to be empty bugbears, as if
   they had it in their power by some means to guard against them. Hence
   arises their eagerness to make every exertion, and their hardihood to
   plot contrivances. He therefore threatens that God will take revenge on
   so gross an insult, and that he has at his command the means of
   executing what he has promised; and that no schemes, inventions, or
   craftiness can overthrow the word of God.

   Of the workers of vanity. [317] He gives them this appellation, because
   they wished to fortify themselves against the hand of God by a useless
   defense; that is, by the unlawful aid of the Egyptians. Formerly, it
   might be thought that he silently admitted their claim to the
   appellation of "wise men," by contrasting them with the wisdom of God;
   but now he scatters the smoke, and openly displays their shame and
   disgrace. This teaches us that there is nothing better than to renounce
   our own judgment, and to submit entirely to God; because all that
   earnest caution by which wicked men torture themselves has no solidity,
   but, on the contrary, as if on purpose, provokes the wrath of God by
   the deceitful contrivances of the flesh.

   3. And surely the Egyptian is a man, and not God. It may be thought
   that Isaiah here brings forward nothing but what is common and beyond
   all doubt; for who ever imagined that the Egyptians were not "men," and
   must be put in the place of "God?" There is indeed no debate on this
   point, and it is openly acknowledged; but when it is found necessary to
   reduce it to practice, men are altogether dull of apprehension, or
   remain uncertain about that which they formerly appeared to know and
   firmly to believe. They exalt themselves as highly, and claim as much
   for themselves, as if they did not believe that they are men, and did
   not think that they ought to obey God. This is the reason why Scripture
   so frequently warns

   "not to trust in men, than whom nothing can be more vain." (Psalm
   146:3.)

   "Cursed is he who trusteth in man, and relieth on an arm of flesh."
   (Jeremiah 17:5.)

   Yet we see both princes and men of ordinary rank contrive and resolve
   in such a manner as if they could establish for a hundred years all
   that they contrived, and could subject heaven, sea, and earth, and
   could regulate and dispose everything according to their will. When we
   perceive in men such pride and arrogance, we need not wonder that the
   Prophet exclaims that "the Egyptians are men, and not God;" for the
   Jews ascribed to them what ought to be ascribed to God, the defense and
   preservation of the Church, which God claims for himself alone, and
   does not allow to be given to another. Isaiah therefore indirectly
   censures that contempt of God and wicked confidence by which they are
   swelled with pride.

   Here we see how great a difference there is between God and men; for
   men have no power in themselves but what God has granted to them. If we
   were reasoning about the nature and excellence of man, we might bring
   forward the singular gifts which he has received from God; but when he
   is contrasted with God, he must be reduced to nothing; for nothing can
   be ascribed to man without taking it from God. And this is the reason
   why we cannot agree with the Papists, when we argue about the cause of
   salvation, freewill, the value of works, and merits; for since on this
   subject God is contrasted with man, we must take from God whatever is
   attributed to man. But they make a division between man and God, so as
   to assign one part to God, and another part to man; while we say, that
   the whole and undivided cause of salvation must be ascribed to God, and
   that no part of it can be attributed to another without detestable
   sacrilege. In a word, let us learn that in such a contrast nothing
   worthy of praise can be left for man.

   And their horses are flesh and not spirit. By the word flesh he means
   weakness and frailty; for what is there in "flesh" but corruption? He
   speaks of "horses," but to the Egyptians also belongs a weakness of the
   same or of a kindred nature; as if he had said that they, and all their
   forces, have nothing that is solid or permanent. Although the Egyptians
   had a soul as well as a body, yet, so far as they were creatures, and
   dwelt in a frail tabernacle, they must hold an inferior rank; as if he
   had said, that they do not possess heavenly or spiritual power; as it
   is said also in the Psalm,

   "Do not trust in princes; for their breath shall go out, and they shall
   return to their earth."
   (Psalm 146:3.)

   So far as relates to "horses," the word "flesh" applies to them with
   greater propriety; but it is not wonderful that men are sent to learn
   from rottenness how frail they are.

   As soon as Jehovah shall stretch out his arm. From this threatening we
   may draw a universal doctrine, that this wickedness shall not pass
   unpunished; for the Lord will not suffer men with impunity to give to
   creatures the honor due to him, or to rely on the assistance of men
   with that confidence which ought to be placed on him alone. He
   therefore threatens those who shall yield assistance and give occasion
   to false confidence, as well as those who shall make use of their
   assistance and rely on it for their safety. And if the Lord cannot
   endure this wicked confidence, where nothing more than temporal safety
   is concerned, how much less will he endure those who, in order to
   obtain eternal salvation, contrive various aids according to their own
   fancy, and thus elevate the power of men, so as to ascribe to it the
   place and authority of God.

   4. For thus hath Jehovah said to me. The Prophet adds this verse, that
   it may not be thought that the Lord leaves us destitute of necessary
   means; for if, while he forbids us to place our confidence in
   creatures, he did not promise us any assistance, we might complain that
   he gave ground for despair, and not for consolation; as we saw, a
   little before, that men are more careful and attentive than they ought
   to be, because they think that they will be deficient in
   thoughtfulness, if they rest satisfied with God alone, and abstain from
   forbidden means. He therefore takes away every excuse, when he promises
   that he will be a faithful guardian to us; for what pretense can be
   left, if we despise the salvation which he offers to us of his own
   accord? It is therefore as if he had said, "The Lord assists, and will
   assist; he forbids you to ask assistance from the Egyptians." By
   comparing himself to a lion, a very powerful animal and keenly bent on
   prey, he employs a very appropriate comparison, to shew that he is in
   the highest degree both able and willing to defend us.

   In the second part of the comparison, the Prophet dwells largely on the
   great eagerness with which the Lord takes hold of his people, keeps
   them near himself, preserves them from being carried off, and defends
   them against all dangers; while he also points out that strength and
   power which no arms and no forces can resist. Now, it is impossible
   that comparisons should hold on every point, nor is it necessary, but
   they ought to be suitable to the subject which is handled. Since
   therefore we know that the Lord loves us so much and takes such care of
   us, must we not be worse than mad if we despise him, and seek other
   aids, which will not only be useless but destructive to us?

   5. As birds that fly. This is the second comparison, by which the
   Prophet shews how great care the Lord takes of us, and how earnestly he
   is bent on making us happy. It is taken from birds, which are prompted
   by astonishing eagerness to preserve their young; for they almost kill
   themselves with hunger, and shrink from no danger, that they may defend
   and preserve their young. Moses makes use of the same comparison when,
   reproaching the people for their ingratitude, he compares the Lord to
   an eagle

   "laying her nest, spreading her wings, and fluttering over her young."
   (Deuteronomy 32:11.)

   Christ also remonstrates with Jerusalem,

   "How often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen
   gathereth her chickens, and ye would not!"
   (Matthew 23:37.)

   The sum of this passage is, that the Lord will be sufficiently powerful
   to defend his people, for whom he has a special love and a peculiar
   care. What Moses relates that God did, Isaiah promises that he will
   always do; for he will never forsake those whom he has once received
   into his favor. Lest any one therefore should imagine that this
   statement related only to the men of a single age, he expressly
   declares that God will spread his wings to defend Jerusalem. Nor is it
   unnecessarily that he mentions not only Mount Zion but its hill; for on
   that "hill" was built the temple in which God desired that men should
   call upon him. Wherever therefore the worship of God is pure, let us
   know that salvation will be certain; for men cannot call upon him in
   vain.

   "Let us be his people, and, on the other hand, he will be our God."
   (Leviticus 26:12.)

   6. Return. This verse is explained in various ways; for the Hebrew
   commentators explain it thus, "Return to the Lord, for you have
   multiplied revolts." But, in my opinion, the meaning is more simple:
   "Return according as you have made a deep revolt; [318] for l'sr
   (laashEr) is, I think, employed in the same sense as k'sr (kaashEr),
   "according as." [319] He means that the aggravated nature of their
   wickedness does not shut the door against them from returning to God,
   if they repent; that, although they have been sunk into the deepest
   wickedness, still God will pardon them. Yet, at the same time, he makes
   use of this spur to stimulate them to earnest grief and hatred of their
   sins, that they may not carelessly and lightly, as frequently happens,
   aim at a half repentance. He therefore bids them consider attentively
   with what fearful destruction they have cast themselves down to hell,
   that they may abhor themselves on account of their aggravated
   transgressions.

   It ought first to be observed, that the Prophet does not lessen the
   guilt of the people. They who need to be brought back to the Lord must
   first be made to have a deep and painful conviction of their guilt; for
   they who flatter themselves in their iniquities are very far from
   obtaining pardon, and therefore there is nothing better than to lay
   open the alarming nature of the disease, when a remedy must be applied.
   Yet, that their hearts may not be led to despair, they must be
   encouraged and comforted by holding out to them the mercy of God; for
   Satan aims at nothing else than to cut us off from all hope of pardon.
   Accordingly, Isaiah declares that, although by their wickedness they
   have sunk down to hell, God is ready to forgive; for not in vain does
   the Lord invite us to repentance, but he likewise offers pardon. Hence
   also, to such exhortations the Scripture always adds promises of grace,
   that, whenever we are called to repentance, we may know that the hope
   of pardon is also held out to us.

   As you have made a deep revolt. Instead of this rendering, the word mq,
   (gnamak,) which signifies to be deep, is explained by some as meaning
   to multiply and the metaphor is supposed to be borrowed from heaps, "As
   you have heaped up your sins, so return now." But I prefer the former
   exposition. srh (sarah) signifies "revolt." Others explain it to mean
   here "depravity," but the word "revolt" is more appropriate. The
   Prophet therefore invites them to return to the Lord. [320]

   O children of Israel. In calling them by this name, he does not intend
   to shew them respect, but reproaches them for their ingratitude; for
   they were degenerate sons [321] who had revolted from the faith and
   obedience of their fathers, and therefore this title contains an
   indirect reproach. Yet he means that the Lord had not forgotten the
   covenant which he made with their fathers, though they had departed
   widely from him by their treachery; for he declares, that he will
   acknowledge them to be "the children of Israel," and will fulfill all
   that he promised to Abraham and the other patriarchs, if they return to
   him with all their heart.

   7. For in that day. He continues the subject which he began in the
   former verse. Yet there is this difference, that in the former verse he
   exhorted to repentance, but now he points out the fruits of repentance,
   which, we know, is the customary way of teaching in Scripture; for,
   since repentance is concealed within us, and has its root in the heart,
   it must be made known by the practical result, and by works, as "a tree
   shews by its fruits" (Matthew 7:17) its inherent goodness; and
   therefore he points out repentance by works which are the fruit of it.
   [322]

   Shall cast away the idols. When he speaks of "idols" only, it is by a
   figure of speech frequently employed in Scripture, in which a part is
   taken for the whole; for the Prophet undoubtedly intended to speak of
   the whole of man's conversion, but, as it would have been tedious to
   enumerate all the kinds, under one of them he includes all the rest.
   Now, the beginning of repentance is the change of the heart; and next
   we must come to outward fruits, that is, to works. Above all, we must
   observe the object which the Prophet had in view in discoursing about
   repentance. It was because the Lord had promised salvation near at
   hand; and, that they might be capable of it, he exhorts them to
   repentance. Hence it ought to be observed that, when we persevere in
   being wicked, we resist God by our wickedness, and thus restrain his
   grace from assisting us; and, therefore, that the way may be open for
   God's assistance, he demands that we shall repent.

   He calls them The idols of his silver and the idols of his gold,
   because, as we have formerly seen, [323] they who sincerely repent are
   affected by deep grief for their sin, so that the traces of their
   superstitions, which are stamped with the highest dishonor of God,
   cannot be beheld by them without the greatest horror. On this account
   they abhor them, and do not dread the loss of "gold or silver," to
   testify their conversion and their faith; for he who has sincerely
   renounced superstitions does not spare any expense in order to possess
   the pure worship of God. This is what the Prophet intended to express
   by calling them "gold and silver" rather than wood and stone. However
   excellent anything may be, the loss of it is a happy event when we are
   cleansed from such base and abominable pollutions. Those who retain
   them, though they profess to be Christians, shew that they are still
   involved in the remains of superstition; and hence it is evident that
   their hearts are not truly or completely reformed. In this matter we
   must listen to none of the excuses which we frequently hear from the
   lips of hypocrites, who cannot absolutely renounce idolatry, "What
   could I do? How could I live? I am aware that this revenue, this gold,'
   is detestable in the sight of God, because it arises from idolatry; but
   in some way or other my life must be supported." Away with such
   fooleries! say I; for where the conversion of the heart is real, that
   which cannot be retained without insulting or dishonoring God is
   instantly thrown away.

   Which your own hands have made. The Prophet urges them to make a more
   full acknowledgment of their sin; for, when men are accused, they
   generally throw the blame on some other person, and do not willingly
   allow it to fall on themselves, or acknowledge that it is chargeable
   upon them; in like manner as the common people willingly accuse the
   priests, but no man is willing to acknowledge his own guilt. The
   Prophet therefore bids them look to "their own hands," that they may
   know that they have committed so great a crime. He reminds them, at the
   same time, how grossly they have been deceived by their unbelief in
   making gods to themselves; and hence we ought to conclude that God
   rejects everything that is of our contrivance, and that he cannot
   accept as good that worship which has originated with ourselves.

   I consider ch't, (chet,) sin, to be a noun; [324] as if he had said,
   "Whenever you behold idols, behold your guilt; acknowledge the proofs
   of your treachery and revolt; and if you are truly converted to God,
   shew it practically, that is, by throwing away idols and bidding adieu
   to superstitions; for this is the true fruit of conversion."

   8. Then the Assyrian. The copulative v (vau) is better translated as an
   adverb of time: "Then the Assyrian shall fall down;" that is, "When you
   shall have turned to the Lord, and when your life shall testify a
   sincere repentance, then the enemy shall fall down;" for, as the Lord
   raised up the Assyrian to punish the Jews for their crimes, and
   especially for idolatry, so he promises that the Assyrians shall be
   brought down, when they shall have ceased to sin and worship idols.
   Hence he informs us, that our obstinacy is the reason why the Lord adds
   evil to evil, and doubles his strokes, and pursues us more and more;
   for we continually supply fresh materials to inflame his vengeance
   against us more and more. If therefore we wish that God's chastisements
   should be less severe, if we wish that the enemies should fall to the
   ground and perish, let us endeavor to be reconciled to him by
   repentance; for he will speedily put an end to the chastisement, and
   will take away from enemies strength and power to injure us.

   By the sword not of a man. [325] The Prophet means that the deliverance
   of the Church is God's own work, that the Jews may know that, although
   no earthly power is visible, God's secret power is sufficient to
   deliver them. If therefore enemies are subdued, if their rage is
   restrained, let us know that it proceedeth from the Lord. By various
   methods, indeed, he represses the force and violence of wicked men, but
   by his own hand alone he delivers his Church; for, while the Lord makes
   use of human means, he preserves his own people miraculously and by
   extraordinary methods, which may be seen to have happened since the
   beginning of the world, and which we may even now behold, if we are not
   blind. And yet this does not hinder the Lord from employing his
   servants to deliver the Church; but he employs them in such a manner
   that his own hand is peculiarly and illustriously displayed in it.

   We know that this prediction of Isaiah was fulfilled when the Assyrian
   army was destroyed, and Sennacherib was put to flight; for "not by the
   arm of man" was he destroyed, but the Lord displayed his power, that it
   might be known that he alone is the deliverer of his Church. (2 Kings
   19:35; Isaiah 37:36.) By delivering Jerusalem at that time from the
   siege, God thus exhibited, as in a picture, spiritual redemption. He
   alone, therefore, will destroy our spiritual enemies. In vain shall we
   resort to other aids or remedies, or rely on our own strength, which is
   nothing; but let us have the direction and assistance of God, and we
   shall come off victorious.

   And his young men shall melt away. [326] He means that the power of the
   Lord displayed against the Assyrians will be so great that the hearts
   of young men, who in other circumstances are wont to be fierce, shall
   be altogether softened and melt like wax; for young men, having less
   experience than old men, are on that account more fierce and impetuous.
   God will easily restrain such fierceness, when he shall determine to
   deliver his people from the hands of their enemies. For this reason
   Isaiah has especially mentioned "young men;" as if he had said, "the
   very flower or strength."

   9. He shall pass to his stronghold for fear. [327] He now speaks of
   Sennacherib himself, who, trembling, shall betake himself in base and
   shameful flight to his "stronghold" or fortress, Nineveh, as to his
   nest. (2 Kings 19:36.) The Prophet adds that "his princes," or military
   officers, whose duty it is to encourage the rest of the soldiers, will
   be so timid that they shall not venture to join the ranks or await the
   battle, but shall "flee away from the standard."

   Saith Jehovah, who hath a fire in Zion. At length he declares that he
   is God's herald in making this proclamation, that the Jews may not, as
   they are accustomed to do, dispute or hesitate as to the accomplishment
   of it, or afterwards forget so great a blessing, and ascribe it to
   fortune. If we read, as some do, Whose fire is in Zion, the meaning
   will be, that God has abundance of fiery power to consume his enemies.
   But I think that the relative 'sr (ashEr) is redundant, or that it
   should be rendered in the nominative case, "Who shall be to him a
   fire;" for God is justly called "a fire," in reference to the
   Assyrians, whom he will consume.

   When the Prophet calls him "a fire," some consider it to refer to
   sacrifices; but such an interpretation appears to me to be feeble and
   unnatural. I have no doubt that he says either that "the Lord has a
   fire" to consume the Assyrian, or that "God himself is a fire," and
   that he thus makes an implied comparison of the Assyrian to straw or
   chaff. He says that this "fire" is kindled and kept alive "in Zion and
   Jerusalem," that is, in the midst of his people, in order to intimate
   that the persecution of the Church of God by wicked men shall not pass
   unpunished; for they shall one day feel that he is their Judge, and
   shall know by experience that he assists his people, who thought that
   they had been left without all assistance.

   In a word, against wicked men, who have maintained unceasing hostility
   against the Church, vengeance is prepared; and the Lord will not only
   avenge himself, but will also avenge his people. Let us therefore enjoy
   this consolation; and though it may appear as if we were defenceless
   and exposed to every danger, yet let us be fully convinced that the
   Lord will be "a fire" to our adversaries.

   analogous use of m'sr, (meashEr,) in Ruth 2:9; but he pronounces the

   CHAPTER 32
     __________________________________________________________________

   Isaiah 32:1-20

   1. Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule
   in judgement.

   1. Ecce in justitia regnabit rex, et principes in judicio præerunt.

   2. And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert
   from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place; as the shadow of a
   great rock in a weary land.

   2. Et erit ille vir velut latibulum a vento, receptus ab imbre, rivi
   aquarum in terra arida, umbra magnæ rupis in terra laboriosa.

   3. And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim; and the ears of them
   that hear shall hearken.

   3. Tunc non oblinentur oculi videntium, et aures audientium
   auscultabunt.

   4. The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the
   tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.

   4. Et cor stultorum intentum erit ad scientiam, et lingua balborum
   expedita erit ad loquendum diserte.

   5. The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said
   to be bountiful.

   5. Non vocabitur amplius sordidus liberalis, neque parcus dicetur
   largus.

   6. For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work
   iniquity, to practice hypocrisy, and to utter error against the Lord,
   to make empty the soul of the hungry; and he will cause the drink of
   the thirsty to fail.

   6. Quoniam sordidus loquetur sordes, et cor ejus machinabitur
   iniquitatem, ad designandam pravitatem, ut proferat subsannationem
   contra Iehovam, exinaniat animam famelicam, et potum sitienti
   subtrahat.

   7. The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked
   devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy
   speaketh right.

   7. Avari arma sunt mala (vel, mensuroe sunt maloe) ipse pravitates
   excogitat, ut circumveniat simplices verbis mendacibus, et loquatur
   contra pauperem in judicio.

   8. But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall
   he stand.

   8. At liberalis liberalia agitabit, et liberaliter agendo progredietur.

   9. Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless
   daughters; give ear unto my speech.

   9. Mulieres quitæ, surgite; audite vocem meam, filiæ confidentes;
   auscultate sermonem meum.

   10. Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for
   the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.

   10. Dies super annum expavescetis, confidentes; quia deficiet vindemia,
   et collectio non veniet.

   11. Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones;
   strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your loins.

   11. Contremiscite, quietæ; trepidate, confidentes; spoliate, nudate,
   accingite lumbos.

   12. They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the
   fruitful vine.

   12. Super ubera plangentes, super agros desideratos, super vitem
   frugiferam.

   13. Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briars; yea,
   upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city:

   13. Super terram populi mei ascendet spina et vepris; etiam super omnes
   domos lætitæ in urbe exultationis.

   14. Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city
   shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy
   of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;

   14. Quoniam palatium desertum, strepitus urbis relictus, turris et
   propugnaculum redigentur in speluncas in perpetuum, ubi gaudeant
   onagri, et pascantur greges.

   15. Until the Spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness
   be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.

   15. Donec super nos effundatur Spiritus ex alto, et ponatur desertum in
   agrum cultum, et ager cultus instar sylvæ reputetur.

   16. Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness
   remain in the fruitful field.

   16. Et habitabit in deserto judicium, et justitia in agro culto
   sedebit.

   17. And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of
   righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever.

   17. Et erit opus justitæ pax; effectus, inquam, justitæ, securitas et
   quies in perpetuum.

   18. And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure
   dwellings, and in quiet restingplaces.

   18. Et sedebit populus meus in tabernaculo pacis, et in mansionibus
   securis, et in refrigeriis quieis.

   19. When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall
   be low in a low place.

   19. Et grando in sylvam descensu divertet, et in loco humili considet
   civitas.

   20. Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth thither
   the feet of the ox and the ass.

   20. Beati vos qui seritis super omnes aquas, qui immittitis pedem bovis
   et asini.


   1. Behold, a King shall reign. He means that God will still be gracious
   to his Church, so as to restore her entirely; and the best method of
   restoring her is, when good government is maintained, and when the
   whole administration of it is conducted with propriety, and with good
   order. This prediction undoubtedly relates to Hezekiah and his reign,
   under which the Church was reformed and restored to its former
   splendor; for formerly it was in a wretched and ruinous condition.
   Ahaz, who was a wicked and disgraceful hypocrite, had corrupted
   everything according to his own wicked dispositions, and had overturned
   the whole condition of civil government and of religion. (2 Kings 16:2,
   3.) He therefore promises another king, namely, Hezekiah, whose power
   and righteousness shall restore the state of affairs which is thus
   wretched and desperate. In a word, he presents to us in this passage a
   lively picture of the prosperous condition of the Church; and as this
   cannot be attained without Christ, this description undoubtedly refers
   to Christ, of whom Hezekiah was a type, and whose kingdom he
   foreshadowed.

   In righteousness and judgment. Here he follows the ordinary usage of
   Scripture, which employs those expressions to denote good government;
   for by righteousness is meant equity and good government, and by
   judgment is meant that part of equity which upholds good men, and
   defends them from the assaults of the wicked. It is undoubtedly true
   that the duty of a good prince embraces a wider extent than
   "righteousness and judgment;" for his great aim ought to be to defend
   the honor of God and religion. But the ordinary usage of Scripture is,
   to describe the whole observation of the law by the works of the second
   table; for, if we refrain from acts of injustice, if we aid, as far as
   lies in our power, those who are oppressed by others, and, in a word,
   if we maintain brotherly kindness, we give evidence of the fear of God,
   from which such fruits spring and grow. From a part, therefore, the
   Prophet has described the whole.

   And princes shall rule. It is not without good reason that he likewise
   mentions nobles; [328] for it would not be enough to be a good prince,
   if he were not supported by upright ministers and counselors.
   Frequently has the condition of the people, under good princes, been
   very bad; as we read of Nerva, [329] under whose reign every kind of
   conduct was tolerated, so that many persons were far less favourably
   situated under his reign than under Nero; for the carelessness and
   indolence of a single individual gave freedom of action to many wicked
   men. It is therefore necessary that a king shall have good governors,
   who shall supply the place of eyes and hands, and aid him in the
   righteous exercise of his authority. If this be not the case, a good
   king cannot advance a step without being more or less retarded by other
   men; and unless rulers move with a harmony resembling that which we
   find in musical instruments, the government of a state cannot be
   carried on with advantage.

   On this subject, men ought to listen to the advice of Jethro, Moses'
   father-in-law, to unite with him

   "able men fearing God, men of truth, and hating covetousness, and to
   appoint such men to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers
   of fifties, and rulers of tens." (Exodus 18:21.)

   But at the present day, those who aid, or pander to their lusts, and
   who favor and flatter them, are promoted by kings to honors and high
   rank, which are bestowed on them as the just reward of their flattery
   or base servility. Nor ought we to wonder if we see, almost throughout
   the whole world, states thrown into confusion, ranks overturned, and
   all good government despised and set aside; for this is the just
   punishment of our iniquities, and we deserve to have such governors,
   since we do not allow God to rule over us. How shall this extraordinary
   kindness of God be enjoyed by men who are openly rebellious and
   profane, or by wicked hypocrites who cast God behind them, and cannot
   bear the yoke of Christ, through whom this prosperity and restoration
   of a declining Church is promised?

   2. And that man shall be. How great is the importance of well-regulated
   government the Prophet shews plainly by these words, when he calls that
   king a hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the rain; for
   mankind can never be so happy as when every one voluntarily abstains
   from every kind of violence and injustice, and when they conduct
   themselves peaceably and without restraint. Since, therefore, most men
   are urged and driven by their furious passions to acts of injustice,
   men would be embroiled in incessant quarreling if a remedy were not
   provided in the laws and courts of justice; but as many rulers, by a
   tyrannical exercise of power, raise more troubles than they allay, it
   is not without good reason that the good king is honored by this
   peculiar commendation. If this was said with truth concerning Hezekiah,
   much more may it be said concerning Christ, in whom we have our best,
   or rather, our only refuge in those storms by which we must be tossed
   about as long as we dwell in this world. Whenever, therefore, we are
   scorched by oppressive heat, let us learn to retire under his shadow;
   whenever we are tossed about by tempests, and think that we are
   overwhelmed by the violence of the waves, let us learn to betake
   ourselves to him as our safest harbour; he will speedily bring every
   storm to a calm, and will completely restore what was ruined and
   decayed.

   3. and 4. Then the eyes of them that see. Hence we see more clearly
   that, while the Prophet describes the reign of Hezekiah, he intends to
   lead us farther; for here he discourses concerning the restoration of
   the Church, which indeed was shadowed out by Hezekiah, but has been
   actually fulfilled in Christ. We know that the Church is never in a
   healthy condition, unless she be internally ruled by righteous and wise
   governors. Now, this cannot be, unless Christ reign; and here,
   therefore, Christ and his reign are specially recommended to us. This
   promise is contrasted with the dreadful threatening which he had
   uttered in a former chapter, (Isaiah 29:10,) that he would blind the
   Jews; for here, on the other hand, he promises the true light, that
   they who were formerly blind may be enlightened, that "the deaf may
   begin to hear, that fools may understand, and that stammerers may
   speak."

   He calls them seeing and hearing who ought to have seen and heard when
   the word of God was exhibited to them; but they chose to be blind and
   deaf, and turned away their thoughts and hearts from doctrine. The Lord
   promises that he will restore to these persons eyes, ears, a tongue,
   and understanding. Now, it is certain that nothing is here promised
   which does not proceed from the grace of God; for he does not merely
   declare what men will do, but what God himself will do in men. These
   are extraordinary gifts of God; as, on the contrary, when he blinds,
   when he takes away understanding and the right use of speech, when he
   suffers ignorance and barbarism to prevail, these are dreadful
   punishments by which he takes vengeance on men for their ingratitude
   and for their contempt of the word. He promises that, at length, in
   compassion towards his people, the Lord will restore what he had justly
   taken away from them; and it must have been through the kindness of
   Christ that a tongue to speak, a mind to understand, and ears to hear,
   are restored to us; for formerly we were dull of apprehension, and were
   struck with frightful stupidity.

   Let us therefore know that out of Christ there is no spiritual life in
   the world, because here they are declared to be destitute of sight,
   hearing, sound understanding, and the proper use of speech,

   "till they be united in one body, of which he is the head." [330]
   (Ephesians 4:15, 16.)

   Hence it follows that, when the kingdom of Christ is overthrown, these
   blessings are also taken away. It ought also to be observed, that the
   blessings which are here recommended are above all others excellent and
   desirable; for riches, and possessions, and everything else in which
   men commonly judge the happiness of life to consist, ought to be
   reckoned of no value in comparison of these blessings. Amidst the
   abundance of all things we shall be miserable, unless the Lord restore
   those spiritual blessings of which the Prophet speaks in this passage;
   and therefore, when they are taken away, let us know that Christ also
   is at a distance from us, and that we are strangers to him, seeing that
   it is from him alone, as Paul informs us, that all spiritual blessings
   flow. (Ephesians 1:3.) When we see that those blessings which had been
   taken away for a long period are now restored to us, let us be ashamed
   of our ingratitude in not rendering to Christ that glory which was due
   to him, and in not employing the understanding which he gave to us in
   spreading his kingdom and promoting his worship; for we plainly shew
   that he has no dominion over us.

   And the heart of fools. [331] As fools are commonly hasty and rash, so
   the Hebrew writers take the word haste [332] as denoting folly; for
   wise men are usually cautious.

   5. No longer shall the base person be called. The Prophet means that
   everything will be restored to good order, so that vices will not, as
   formerly, be reckoned virtues; for, when the public government is
   wicked, covetous persons are in power, and are honored and esteemed,
   because men judge of virtue by wealth and power; a poor man is
   everywhere despised, though he be truly upright and bountiful to the
   full extent of his ability; and, in a word, in such a state of things
   there is nothing but disorder and confusion. But good government
   quickly detects such pretences and masks; for, where virtue is
   esteemed, vices are immediately exposed. Good men also have greater
   freedom allowed them in restraining the wantonness of those who
   formerly trod under their feet all that is just and lawful.

   When the Prophet speaks here about the condition and reformation of the
   Church, which is a spiritual government, we ought to raise our minds
   somewhat higher, so as to view all this as relating to Christ, to whom
   it specially and peculiarly belongs to expose hidden vices, and to
   remove those vails and coverings by which the appearance of vices is
   changed, so that they are praised as if they were virtues. He does this
   by means of the gospel, by which he drags into light the disgraceful
   actions which were formerly concealed, and openly shews what they
   really are, so that no man, unless he choose it, can be deceived by
   their outward appearance. And this is the reason why the gospel is so
   much hated by the world; for no man can patiently endure to have his
   "hidden thoughts" and concealed baseness "revealed." (Luke 2:35.)
   Philosophers indeed reason admirably about covetousness and liberality,
   and in some degree explain what is the difference between them; but
   they never penetrate into the hearts, so as to search them and actually
   distinguish between the covetous man and the bountiful. This can only
   be done by Christ's light, when he shines by means of the gospel, and,
   by exploring the deepest corners of the human heart, brings us to
   spiritual and inward obedience. In this passage, therefore, we are
   brought to the judgment-seat of Christ, who alone, by exposing
   hypocrisy, reveals whether we are covetous or bountiful.

   6. For the vile person will speak vileness. We might also render it,
   "The wicked man will speak wickedly;" for nvlh (nEbalah) denotes
   "baseness" or any wickedness, such as is meant by the French word
   lascheté, or by the English words, "lewdness" or "baseness." It might
   also be rendered, "The fool will speak wickedly;" and thus there would
   be an allusion to the words nvl (nabal) and nvlh, (nEbalah,) [333]
   though the meaning would be considerably different; but, since he
   employed this word in the former verse, when speaking of "vile"
   persons, I willingly adopt that interpretation.

   And his heart will contrive iniquity. I consider 'vn (avEn) to denote
   "wickedness;" for he speaks of giving themselves up continually to sin
   and do wickedly, as is plainly shewn by what follows; for his earnest
   remonstrances are directed against wicked men, who abandon themselves
   to all that is vile, and are not moved by any feeling of conscience,
   who laugh at all warnings, and ridicule God and his servants. Christ
   also drags them into the light, and exposes what lay concealed under
   coverings; for to him, as we have said, it peculiarly belongs to

   "pierce, by the sword of the gospel, the hidden feelings of the heart,
   that they may answer to the judgment of God." (Hebrews 4:12.)

   Isaiah therefore continues the same subject which he had formerly begun
   to explain.

   Others explain it differently, but, as I think, in an unsuitable
   manner; for they think that it is a kind of proverbial saying, and
   render it in the present tense, "The vile person speaketh vileness."
   But I think that the Prophet means something higher, namely, that
   Christ is the Judge of the world, and therefore, when he shall ascend
   the judgment-seat, he will shew what is the disposition of every
   person; for, so long as he does not exercise the office of a judge,
   everything remains in confusion, the wicked are applauded, because they
   have the appearance of piety, and the most excellent men are despised.
   But Christ will openly display the life of every person, so that what
   formerly, under some pretense, bore a fair reputation, will be
   manifested to be wickedness; and on this account he is said to

   "have in his hand a sieve for separating the wheat from the chaff."
   (Matthew 3:12.)

   Now, this sieve is the gospel, by which, as a Judge, he brings
   malefactors to trial, and draws forth, in spite of their efforts, the
   exposure of their transgressions and crimes.

   We have the experience of this more and more every day, when an
   exposure is made of that wickedness which had been concealed under the
   mask of Popery and the strange folds of superstitions. Who would ever
   have thought, amidst that darkness, that there were concealed in the
   hearts of men such dreadful monsters as are brought forward at the
   present day? To such a height has the contempt of God arisen, that many
   discover themselves to be more like beasts than men. Yet the Papists
   slander us, as if by our doctrine we gave loose reins to men, and
   exhorted them to despise God and follow wickedness without fear or
   shame. But let them listen to Isaiah, who replies that, when the truth
   of God shall be made known, vile persons will speak vileness, and
   wicked persons will speak baseness and wickedness; and, indeed, Christ
   would not be a spiritual judge if he did not

   "reveal the secret thoughts of the heart, and bring every hidden thing
   to light." (Luke 2:35.)

   To make empty the hungry soul. In addition to those mockeries which the
   reprobate cast against God, cruelty is next mentioned. The Prophet thus
   gives an exact enumeration of those actions which are contrary to the
   second table. Wicked men begin with despising God, then rush to outward
   crimes, and practice cruelty of every sort against their neighbors.
   Now, the worst and most flagrant of all cruelty is, to "snatch food
   from the hungry soul and drink from the thirsty;" for mere natural
   feeling prompts us to mercy and (sumpatheian) [334] compassion. When
   men are so brutalized that they are not affected by the misery of
   others, and lay aside every feeling of humanity, they must be worse
   than the beasts themselves, who have some sort of pity for the wants of
   their own kind.

   7. The instruments of the covetous man are evil. We must always keep by
   the future tense; for he does not inquire what wicked men are, but
   declares that they shall be revealed under the reign of Christ, that
   they may no longer deceive or impose upon any one. He speaks of the
   heavenly light which would arise, as we have already said, to expose
   hidden wickedness. Christ therefore shews what covetous men are, and
   how destructive are the means which they employ. If it be thought
   better that kly (kEle) should be translated "measures," I have no
   objection; but the word "instrument" is more appropriate and extensive,
   for it includes "instruments" of every description. It means therefore
   every kind of means, tricks, and cunning devices, by which "covetous
   men" put simple persons off their guard, and draw them into their nets.

   To deceive the simple by lying words. He now assigns the reason. It is,
   because they do not cease to contrive some injury. [335] It is certain
   that this is a description of the practices of bad men, who think of
   nothing but their own convenience and gain, and are always bent on
   cheating and "deceiving." Christ brings to light those persons, and
   their tricks and contrivances.

   To speak against the poor in judgment. [336] Various circumstances are
   brought forward, to present in a more striking light the shamefulness
   of this wickedness. First, "to deceive the simple," who cannot take
   care of themselves, is more shameful and flagrant than to deceive
   sharpers and veterans in crime. It is shameful, secondly, to make use
   of deceitful blandishments under the pretense of friendship; thirdly,
   to deceive "the poor," whose poverty we ought rather to have relieved;
   fourthly, to lay snares in the very court of justice. This is more
   highly criminal than if a man were attacked by open violence; for the
   court of justice ought to be a refuge for the poor, and what shall
   become of them, if it be a den of robbers or thieves? If the roads are
   beset by robbers, and if snares are laid, there may be some way of
   avoiding them; but there is no possibility of guarding against the
   frauds committed in courts of justice. These circumstances, therefore,
   ought to be carefully remarked.

   8. But the liberal shall devise liberal things. We have already said
   that these statements of the Prophet have a deeper meaning than is
   commonly supposed; for he does not speak in the ordinary sense of the
   words, but treats of the reformation of the Church. This relates
   therefore to the regenerate, over whom Christ reigns; for, although all
   are called by the voice of the gospel, yet there are few who suffer
   themselves to be placed under his yoke. The Lord makes them truly kind
   and bountiful, so that they no longer seek their own convenience, but
   are ready to give assistance to the poor, and not only do this once or
   oftener, but every day advance more and more in kindness and
   generosity.

   In acting liberally he shall make progress. This passage is commonly
   explained in a different manner, namely, that the liberal advance
   themselves, and become great by doing good; because God rewards them,
   and bestows on them greater blessings. This view pleases at first
   sight; but the Prophet, on the contrary, shews that the liberal will
   never cease to perform acts of generosity, for they will daily make
   greater progress, and will pursue the same designs and adhere firmly to
   their intention, as it is said by the Psalmist,

   "He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness
   endureth for ever." (Psalm 112:9; 2 Corinthians 9:9.)

   This is added, because it is easy to counterfeit liberality for a time;
   many even think that they are sincerely bountiful because they have
   performed an act of beneficence, but quickly cease and change their
   purpose. But true liberality is not momentary or of short duration.
   They who possess that virtue persevere steadily, and do not exhaust
   themselves in a sudden and feeble flame, of which they quickly
   afterwards repent.

   This is what the Prophet intended to express by the word qvm, (kum,)
   which signifies to "arise" and "grow." There are indeed many
   occurrences which retard the progress of our liberality. We find in men
   strange ingratitude, so that what we give appears to be ill bestowed.
   Many are too greedy, and, like horse-leeches, suck the blood of others.
   But let us remember this saying, and listen to Paul's exhortation "not
   to be weary in well-doing;" for the Lord exhorts us not to momentary
   liberality, but to that which shall endure during the whole course of
   our life. (Galatians 6:9.)

   9. Ye women at ease, arise. These words appear not to be connected with
   what goes before; for formerly he spoke about restoring the Church, but
   now he threatens that the judgment of God is ready to strike a people
   carelessly reposing amidst riches and pleasures; and therefore it is
   probable that here Isaiah begins a new and distinct subject. Yet there
   will be no absurdity in connecting this with the former prediction, for
   the Prophets commonly observe this order. After having promised the
   grace of God to believers, they next direct their discourse to
   hypocrites, to declare that the mercy which the Lord promises to
   believers will be of no avail to hypocrites, and that notwithstanding
   they shall be punished for their sins.

   As to women being chiefly addressed, the Hebrew commentators, agreeably
   to the frequent usage of their language, suppose "cities" [337] to be
   meant; but I think that the language here is not figurative, and I
   rather adhere to the simple meaning of the words. He addresses "women"
   rather than men, in order to shew the extent of that calamity; for in
   ordinary circumstances women and children are spared, because they are
   unfit for war, and have no power to defend themselves. He says that the
   destruction will be so cruel that none shall be spared.

   He expressly addresses them also as "women at ease," who are usually
   more delicate than others, and, enjoying the advantages of wealth, have
   some means of providing for their safety and of rescuing themselves
   from calamities, even when persons of ordinary rank are suffering
   grievous hardships. But to them especially Isaiah makes the intimation,
   that they must "arise" and "tremble;" and he contrasts this trembling
   with the ease and luxury which they peacefully enjoyed. He bids them
   arise, that they may know that this is not the time for repose, and
   that the Lord will arouse them from their ease and indifference.

   Hear my voice, ye careless daughters. [338] In the same manner as
   before, the word daughters is interpreted by the rabbins to mean
   "villages" or "smaller cities;" but I think, as I have already said,
   that it ought to be taken in its literal meaning. He shews them whence
   shall arise this terror, whence shall arise that violence which shall
   compel them to "arise" and "tremble." It is from the judgment of God.
   But he mentions "a voice," that they may know that this prophecy shall
   not fail of its accomplishment; because he proclaims war against them
   by the command of God. "How efficacious this speech shall be, and what
   power it shall have to arouse you, one day you shall actually feel." So
   frequently does he reproach them for indolence, carelessness, and
   luxury, not only because it is harder for those who live at ease to be
   harshly aroused, but because the corruption and depravity of human
   nature make it scarcely possible for the world to enjoy ease and
   prosperity without becoming indolent. Next, falling gradually into
   slothfulness, it will deceive itself by a false imagination, and drive
   far away from it all fear, and, relying on this confidence, will
   insolently rise up against God.

   10. Days above a year. [339] By these words he declares that the
   calamity will be of long duration; for it is no slight consolation in
   adversity, when the distresses which must otherwise have been endured
   by us with grief and sorrow pass quickly away. But when no end and no
   mitigation of sorrows, no comfort or hope of deliverance is held out to
   us, what can be left but despair? He therefore threatens not only that
   they shall endure them for one year, but that afterwards they must look
   for new afflictions.

   You shall tremble. By this word he indirectly stings their
   slothfulness, by declaring that they who grudged to listen to calm
   instruction shall be dragged forth with trembling and alarm. As the
   Jews were excessively anxious about earthly blessings and perishing
   food, he addresses their senses by threatening a scarcity of wine and
   wheat. If they had been more thoroughly purified from grovelling
   desires, he would rather have threatened what Jeremiah deplores in his
   Lamentations, that

   "the sacrifices and festivals had ceased, and that the holy assemblies
   were discontinued." (Lamentations 1:7.)

   But, because they were sunk in their pleasures, and had not made such
   proficiency as to know the value of spiritual blessings, the Prophet
   accommodates himself to their ignorance, and addresses their bellies
   rather than their understandings. He speaks of the desolation of the
   fields, which would be the necessary consequence of that calamity; for
   abundance and plenty commonly give rise to ease and indifference. "The
   Lord will therefore," says he, "deprive you of all food, and shake off
   your slothfulness, and take away all ground of confidence."
   Accordingly, we are here reminded that we ought not to sleep in the
   midst of prosperity, nor imagine that we are safe, as if we could
   expect uninterrupted prosperity in the world. But we ought to use with
   moderation the gifts of God, if we do not wish to be suddenly aroused,
   and to be overwhelmed when we are off our guard, and to feel the
   heavier distress because we did not look for a change of our affairs.

   11. Tremble. This repetition is not unnecessary, but states more fully
   what he formerly said; for when men are asleep, they are not easily
   aroused by the voice of the prophets, and therefore it is needful to
   cry aloud and reprove them continually. And thus, by adding one
   threatening to another, or by repeating the same threatenings, he shews
   how great is the stupidity of men, when they have once been blinded by
   prosperity; for they can scarcely endure any longer to hear the
   warnings which God addresses to them. Men are undoubtedly more in
   danger from prosperity than from adversity; for when matters go
   smoothly with them, they flatter themselves, and are intoxicated by
   their success; and therefore it was necessary to deal more sharply with
   the Jews, in order to shake off that slothfulness. This exhortation of
   the Prophet ought to be explained in the future tense; as if he had
   said, "You shall at length tremble, for the rest which you now enjoy
   will not be perpetual."

   By bidding them make themselves bare, and gird sackcloth on their
   loins, he describes the manner and dress of mourners. Whenever they
   were visited by deep adversity, they put on sackcloth, made bare the
   other parts of their body, and by dress, and attitude, and every
   method, manifested their grief. He desires women to put on sackcloth
   and other expressions of mourning, instead of the luxuries and
   pleasures in which they eagerly indulged.

   12. Mourning over the breasts. This verse is explained in various ways.
   Some understand it to mean simply, that there will be so great a
   scarcity of provisions, that women will lose their milk, and thus the
   children will "mourn over dry breasts;" which we see sometimes happen,
   when a very great scarcity of provisions occasions leanness. But the
   more generally received and more appropriate interpretation is, to view
   the word "breasts" as figuratively denoting fields and vineyards, as
   the Prophet himself declares; for they are justly compared to the
   breasts of mothers, because, by deriving nourishment from them, we suck
   the milk or blood of the earth. He therefore means that there will be a
   want of food and nourishment, because the Lord will curse the earth, so
   that it shall yield no fruits. Thus shall men sigh over that scarcity,
   as if over their mother's "breasts," from which they formerly received
   delicious nourishment. This appears to me to be a more natural meaning,
   and to agree best with the context; for it serves to explain what
   afterwards follows, about "rich fields and the fruitful vine." [340]

   13. There shall grow up the brier and the thorn. He confirms the former
   verse, and explains the cause of barrenness and famine, which is, that
   the fields, which formerly used to be fat and fertile, will be
   uncultivated, desolate, and barren. This was a frightful change of
   affairs; for we know that that country yielded corn and fruits more
   plentifully than other countries, not so much by nature as by the
   blessing of God; for he had said, "I will give you a land flowing with
   milk and honey." (Exodus 3:8, 17; 13:5; 33:3.) This was the cause of
   the abundance and fertility.

   On the land of my people. By giving it this name, he meets an objection
   which they might otherwise have brought, that there was no reason to
   fear that the land which God had chosen would not produce fruits every
   year; because, although the kindness of God extends to all mankind, yet
   he was in a peculiar manner the Father and supporter of that nation. It
   was therefore incredible that this land, which had been set apart for
   the children of God, would be covered with "briers and thorns;" and
   thus the Prophet reproves the Jews more sharply, because they not only
   made void the blessing of God by their wickedness, but drew down his
   wrath, so as to spoil and deface the beauty of the land.

   Even on all the houses of joy. The particle ky (ki) signifies even,
   though some think that it means "for" or "because," "Because there is
   joy in their houses." [341] But that interpretation cannot be admitted,
   because vty (batte,) "houses of," is in the construct state. This
   appears to me therefore to be an enlargement of what he had now said,
   and to mean that this desolation will be, not only in the utmost
   corners of the land, but "even in the houses of joy," that is, in the
   splendid and magnificent houses, which formerly were the abodes of the
   most refined luxury. When the Prophet said this, he was undoubtedly
   ridiculed by the men of that age; men certainly did not listen to him
   amidst those luxuries by which they were blinded. Besides, they grew
   insolent on account of the promises of God, and thought that they would
   never be in want of anything. Yet all that Isaiah foretold came to
   pass. From this example let us learn to be moderate in our use of
   prosperity, and to depend on the blessing of God, so as to obey his
   word with a good conscience.

   14. For the palace shall be forsaken. Here also he describes more fully
   the desolation of the country; for, having mentioned in the former
   verse magnificent houses, he now likewise adds palaces and cities, so
   as to shew that there is nothing, however splendid and illustrious,
   that is exempted from that calamity. We see that men are dazzled by
   their own splendor, till they lift up their eyes to heaven; and the
   consequence is, that they are soothed to sleep in the midst of their
   wealth, and dread nothing. He therefore declares that all that was
   splendid, magnificent, and lofty, in Judea, cities, palaces, bulwarks,
   fortresses, all will be brought to nothing. When he says for ever, he
   again gives warning, as he formerly did, that this calamity will not
   last only for a single day, but that, as they had been long hardened in
   their vices, so it will be of long duration; for, if they had been
   punished only for a short time, being obstinate and intractable, they
   would quickly have relapsed into their natural disposition.

   15. Till the Spirit be poured out upon you. Because the Prophet speaks
   of the Jews among whom God had determined to plant his Church, it was
   therefore necessary to leave to them some hope of salvation, that they
   might not faint amidst so great afflictions; for, while the Lord is
   severe towards wicked men who falsely shelter themselves under his
   name, yet in some manner he preserves his Church. The Prophet therefore
   adds this promise, that they might know that, whatever be the severity
   with which he punishes his people, still he is always mindful of his
   covenant; for he never threatens in such a manner as not to leave some
   ground for consolation, so as to cheer and comfort the hearts of
   believers, even when their affairs are utterly desperate. Besides, in
   order that they may fully enjoy the comfort which is offered to them,
   he raises their eyes to the very Author of life; and indeed we see
   that, when a favorable change takes place, the greater part of men fill
   themselves to excess with bread and wine, and, when they are pressed by
   famine, they neglect God and solicit the earth.

   With good reason, therefore, does Isaiah say that "the Spirit" will
   come from on high to refresh and fertilize the earth; and he alludes, I
   have no doubt, to that saying of David,

   "Send forth thy Spirit, and they shall be created, and thou wilt renew
   the face of the earth."
   (Psalm 104:30.)

   Holding out this as an evidence that God is reconciled, he at the same
   time declares that the restoration of the Church proceeds solely from
   the grace of God, who can remove its barrenness as soon as he has
   imparted strength from heaven; for he who created all things out of
   nothing, as if they had formerly existed, is able to renew it in a
   moment.

   And the wilderness become a Carmel. [342] In explaining this comparison
   of "the wilderness" to "Carmel," commentators are sadly at a loss; but,
   as I remarked on a former passage, (Isaiah 29:17,) where a similar
   phrase occurred, [343] the Prophet merely, in my opinion, points out
   the happy effect of that restoration, namely, that the abundance and
   plenty of all things will prove that God is actually reconciled to his
   people. He says that places which formerly were "wildernesses" shall be
   like "Carmel," which was a rich and fertile spot, and on that account
   receives its name; and that "Carmel" shall be like "a wilderness," that
   is, it shall be so fertile, that if we compare what it now is with what
   it shall afterwards be, it may seem like "a wilderness." It is an
   enlarged representation of that unwonted fertility. "Fields now barren
   and uncultivated shall be fertile, and cultivated and fertile fields
   shall yield such abundant fruit that their present fertility is poverty
   and barrenness, in comparison of the large produce which they shall
   afterwards yield;" just as if we should compare the fields of Savoy
   with those of Sicily and Calabria, and pronounce them to be a
   "wilderness." In a word, he describes unparalleled fertility, which
   believers shall enjoy, when they have been reconciled to God, in order
   that they may know his favor by his acts of kindness.

   While Isaiah thus prophesies concerning the reign of Hezekiah, all this
   is declared by him to relate to the kingdom of Christ as its end and
   accomplishment; and therefore, when we come to Christ, we must explain
   all this spiritually, so as to understand that we are renewed as soon
   as the Lord has sent down the Spirit from heaven, that we who were
   "wildernesses" may become cultivated and fertile fields. Ere the Spirit
   of God has breathed into us, we are justly compared to wildernesses or
   a dry soil; for we produce nothing but "thorns and briers," and are by
   nature unfit for yielding fruits. Accordingly, they who were barren and
   unfruitful, when they have been renewed by the Spirit of God, begin to
   yield plentiful fruits; and they whose natural dispositions had some
   appearance of goodness, being renewed by the same Spirit, will
   afterwards be so fruitful, that they will appear as if they had
   formerly been a "wilderness;" for all that men possess is but a wild
   forest, till they have been renewed by Christ. Whenever, therefore, the
   Church is afflicted, and when her condition appears to be desperate,
   let us raise our eyes to heaven, and depend fully on these promises.

   16. And judgment shall dwell in the wilderness. The Prophet shews what
   is the actual condition of the Church, that is, when justice and
   judgment prevail; for men ought not to be like cattle, which seek
   nothing but plenty of food and abundance of outward things. And hence
   it is plain enough that the Jews were not confined to transitory
   enjoyments, so as to have their hope fixed exclusively on earthly
   blessings, as some fanatics imagine. They were enjoined to attend to
   that which was of the greatest importance, that justice and judgment
   should prevail; and undoubtedly they knew that true happiness consists
   in it. It is therefore our duty to look chiefly to this, that we should
   not, like hogs in a sty, judge of the happiness of life by abundance of
   bread and wine; for this is the end of all the blessings which the Lord
   bestows upon us, this is the object of our deliverance, "that we should
   serve him," as Zacharias says, "in holiness and righteousness." (Luke
   1:74, 75.)

   Under the terms "justice" and "judgment," as we have already seen, he
   includes all that belongs to uprightness; for although these two words
   relate strictly to that equity which ought to be mutually cultivated
   among us, yet, since it is customary to describe the observation of the
   whole law by the duties of the second table, here the Prophet, by a
   figure of speech in which a part is taken for the whole, embraces also
   piety and the worship of God. The Prophets are accustomed to notice the
   chief duties of brotherly kindness, and those which belong to the
   second table, because by these, more than by any others, we manifest
   the real state of our feelings towards God.

   When he declares that justice and judgment have their abode in the
   wilderness, as well as in the cultivated fields, this shews more
   clearly that the abundance of blessings promised a little before was so
   great that, when men saw it, they would consider that those fields
   which they formerly looked upon as very excellent had been
   comparatively barren.

   17. And the work of righteousness shall be peace. A little before, he
   censured severely that peace which made the Jews drowsy and slothful;
   he now promises a different kind of repose, which will be a striking
   proof of the love of God, who has received them into favor, and will
   faithfully guard them. We ought therefore to observe the implied
   contrast between that brutal repose which the reprobate think that they
   obtain by their presumption in committing every kind of wickedness, and
   in which they also fall asleep, and that different kind of repose, on
   the other hand, which the children of God obtain by a religious and
   holy life, and which Isaiah exhorts us to desire, shewing that we ought
   fearlessly to believe that a blessed and joyful peace awaits us when we
   have been reconciled to God.

   In this way he recommends to them to follow uprightness, that they may
   obtain assured peace; for, as Peter declares, there is no better way of
   procuring favor, that no man may do us injury, than to abstain from all
   evil-doing. (1 Peter 3:13.) But the Prophet leads them higher, to aim
   at a religious and holy life by the grace of God; for nothing is more
   unreasonable than that wicked men should desire to have peace, while
   they are continually fighting against God. That wish is indeed common;
   for hardly one person in a hundred shall be found who does not loudly
   extol peace, while at the same time every man raises up enemies to
   himself in the earth, and all in vast crowds disturb heaven and earth
   by their crimes. Now, the latter repose, being perpetual, is compared
   by him to the former, which is slight and momentary.

   The effect of righteousness. When peace receives this designation, let
   us learn that, as wars proceed from the wrath of God, which we provoke
   by our wickedness, so peace springs from his blessing. When, therefore,
   we see enemies enraged to battle, and rising furiously against us, let
   us seek no other remedy than repentance; for the Lord will easily allay
   commotions when we have returned to him. He it is, as the Psalmist
   says, who

   "maketh wars to cease to the ends of the earth, who breaketh the bow,
   and cutteth the spear in pieces, and burneth the chariots in the fire."
   (Psalm 46:9.)

   We have already said that these things do not relate exclusively to
   Hezekiah, but must be referred to Christ.

   18. And my people shall dwell. As we have said that spiritual
   righteousness is that which has its seat in the hearts of men, we must
   say the same thing about peace, which is the fruit of it. Accordingly,
   when quiet habitations and resting-places are here mentioned, let us
   remember the saying of Paul, "justified by faith, we have peace with
   God." (Romans 5:1.) When Christ says that he "leaves" this peace to the
   disciples, (John 14:27,) he affirms that "it cannot be given by the
   world;" and we ought not to wonder at this, for, as the same Apostle
   Paul informs us in another passage, "this peace surpasses all
   understanding." (Philippians 4:7.) Having obtained this righteousness,
   we are no longer restless or alarmed within, as when we feel in the
   gnawings of conscience the wrath of God. A bad conscience is always
   alarmed, and harassed by wretched uneasiness.

   Wicked men must therefore be uneasy, and distressed by a variety of
   terrors; for where righteousness is banished that peace cannot be
   found; and where Christ reigns, there alone do we find true peace.
   Assured peace, therefore, is enjoyed by none but believers, who appeal
   to the heavenly tribunal, not only by their piety, but by their
   reliance on the mercy of God. Hence we infer that Christ does not yet
   reign where consciences are uneasy, and tossed by the various waves of
   doubts, as must be the case with Papists and all others who are not
   built on the sacrifice of Christ and the atonement obtained through
   him.

   19. And the hail. We have already said that the prophets are accustomed
   frequently to describe under figures the reign of Christ; for they
   borrow their metaphors from an earthly kingdom, because our ignorance
   would make it almost impossible for us to comprehend, in any other way,
   the unspeakable treasure of blessings. The meaning is, "The Lord will
   remove from his people distresses and annoyances, and will make them
   fall on others;" because here we are liable to various storms and
   tempests, and must endure rain, hail, showers, winds, and tempests. He
   says that God, by his wonderful providence, will prevent all distresses
   from doing any injury to believers, because he will drive their
   violence in another direction.

   By forests he means unfrequented and desert places, where there are no
   crowds of men. Hence we learn that, when we are under the guardianship
   of Christ, we are protected from inconveniences and dangers, but that,
   at the same time, various storms and tempests are ready to burst on our
   heads. But the Lord is our deliverer, who turns away in another
   direction the evils that are approaching, or rescues us when we are in
   danger.

   And the city shall be situated to a low place. [344] In order to
   confirm what he had said about peace, he says, that "cities," which
   shall be situated on level ground, will be out of danger; for at that
   time it was customary to build on high and elevated places, that the
   access to them might be more difficult. "Such," says he, "will be God's
   protection of his people, that they will not need the ordinary
   fortifications, because the city may be safely set down in valleys; and
   even although it be liable to the attacks of enemies, it will sustain
   no inconvenience, for the hand of the Lord will protect it." We must
   not therefore seek safety by relying on our defences, lest we be
   immediately driven from our nest; but since our heavenly Father deigns
   to provide for our safety, let us be satisfied with having him for our
   protector and guardian. [345]

   20. Blessed are ye. He shews how great will be the change, when Christ
   shall begin to reign; for he had formerly said that so great would be
   the desolation, that "thorns and briers" would overspread the holy
   land, costly houses would be thrown down, and cities and palaces would
   be levelled with the earth. This would happen, when the incessant
   attacks of enemies should lay that country desolate. But now he says
   that they shall be blessed, because God will give them abundant produce
   of all fruits. That fertility which might have been described in simple
   language, he illustrates by figures, that they shall "sow in marshes,"
   and shall "send forth their cattle" into the fields without dread of
   losing them.

   By waters some understand a rich and fertile soil; but the universal
   particle kl, (chOl,) all, leads me to take a different view; as if he
   had said, "Places which were overrun with waters shall be fit for
   sowing, and there will be no reason to fear that the water shall spoil
   our fields." We are accustomed also to drive away oxen, and asses, and
   other animals, from fields, and especially from sown fields, that they
   may not eat the corn. But here he says that the corn will grow so thick
   and plentifully, that it shall be necessary to send oxen and asses to
   crop the early blade, as is commonly done when the corn is luxuriant.
   [346]

   He calls them blessed, in accordance with the usage of the Hebrew
   language, because their labor will never be unprofitable. If it be
   objected that, under the reign of Christ, such fertility has never been
   seen, I acknowledge that, even when God has shewn the highest kindness
   to his people, still there have always been visible marks of the curse,
   which was entailed on mankind by the fall and revolt of Adam. (Genesis
   3:17.) But since Christ has restored to believers the inheritance of
   the world, with good reason do the prophets assert that he would renew
   the earth, so as to remove its filthiness and restore that beauty which
   it had lost. They who complain that it is not yet fulfilled, ought to
   consider whether or not they themselves are purified from every stain
   of sin. And if they are still at a great distance from spiritual
   righteousness, let them be satisfied with enjoying the blessing of God
   according to the measure of regeneration, the full enjoyment of which
   we must not expect to obtain, till, freed from the pollution of the
   flesh, we shall bear the perfect image of God.

   [328] In our Author's version, from which the heading of this paragraph
   is taken, he makes use of the word principes, which commonly means
   "rulers," but sometimes also (as in the phrases, "facile princeps,
   femina princeps,") denotes persons of high rank, or those who in any
   respect are highly distinguished. But here he employs the word
   proceres, "nobles;" and he does so evidently for the purpose of
   removing ambiguity, and of stating clearly that view which is contained
   in the conclusion of this sentence. -- Ed. ^FT585 The singular mildness
   of the Roman Emperor Nerva, which made him personally beloved, was
   carried to such an excess as to impair the efficiency of his
   government, and compelled him to resign the throne to the able and
   excellent Trajan. On the other hand, Nero, whose name cannot be
   mentioned without awakening the remberance of his monstrous cruelty,
   held the reins with a firmer hand, and prevented the repetition of many
   disorders which had been committed under the reign of his amiable
   predecessor Nerva. -- Ed ^FT586 "Duquel il soit le chef." ^FT587 "The
   heart also of the rash. (Heb. hasty.)" -- Eng.Ver. "The heart also of
   the hasty." -- Stock ^FT588 This observation is founded on the Hebrew
   word nmhrym, (nimharim,) which our Author translates Fools, and which
   literally means Hasty. -- Ed ^FT589 The allusion would be better
   brought out by rendering it, "The fool will speak folly." -- Ed ^FT590
   Sumpatheia, a more extensive term than the English word "sympathy,"
   literally denotes "fellow-feeling," and is frequently employed by our
   Author to express that kind of feeling which every man ought to cherish
   towards his fellow-men. -- Ed ^FT591 "Quelque trahison;" -- "Some
   treachery." ^FT592 "Even when the needy speaketh right;" or, "when he
   speaketh against the poor in judgment." -- Eng. Ver. ^FT593 "Ye
   provinces that dwell at ease." -- Jarchi ^FT594 "Ye cities that dwell
   carelessly." -- Jarchi. In this, as well as in the former case, he
   refers to Jonathan's Targum. -- Ed ^FT595 "Many days and years; (Heb.
   days above a year.)" -- Eng. Ver. "In a year and more." -- Alexander.
   "Shortly after a year; Heb. days upon a year: that is, the time will
   soon come after the expiration of one year, when ye shall be troubled
   with a dearth." -- Stock ^FT596 "It may be better translated, striking
   your breasts, because of the pleasant fields and fruitful vines, which
   should be destroyed by the Assyrians. It was a common gesture used on
   all mournful occasions, to strike the breasts; though others think
   teats may be taken metaphorically for the pleasant fields and fruitful
   vine by which they subsisted, as infants by the mother's paps." --
   Samuel White ^FT597 "For all that desolation shall be on all joyful
   houses." -- Jarchi ^FT598 "And the wilderness become a fruitful field."
   Such is the Author's own translation of the clause, which corresponds
   to our authorized version. -- Ed ^FT599 See our Author's Commentary on
   that [43]passage. -- Ed ^FT600 "And the city shall be low in a low
   place;" or, "And the city shall be utterly abased." -- Eng. Ver. ^FT601
   "Some by the Forest understand Nineveh, some Babylon, some Jerusalem,
   and some the Assyrian army; but Gataker, and Vatablus before him, think
   the words may be rendered, he shall hail with hail on the forest, and
   cities shall be built in low places; as if he had said, God shall
   preserve the fruits of the earth from the injuries of unseasonable
   weather, and, when he sends a storm of hail, cause it to fall on the
   woods and deserts; and he shall give them so great security, that for
   the future they shall build their cities in low grounds, to shew that
   they are under no apprehension of being overrun any more by an enemy."
   -- White ^FT602 "Happy ye who shall enjoy as great fertility as if all
   your lands lay on the side of a running stream. Your corn shall grow so
   thick and fast that ye shall be forced to let your cattle crop the
   luxuriant ears; a practice still in use among our husbandmen." -- White

   THE PROPHECIES OF ISAIAH
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTERS 1--16
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 1

   1 The vision of Isaiah, the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah
   and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings
   of Judah.

   2 Hear, O heavens,
   And hearken, O earth,
   For thus the Lord speaketh:
   I have nourished and brought up children;
   Yet they have acted wickedly towards me. [347]

   3 The ox knoweth his owner,
   And the ass his masters crib;
   Israel doth not know;
   My people doth not understand.

   4 O sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity,
   Seed of evil-doers, degenerate children!
   They have forsaken Jehovah,
   They have despised [348] the Holy One of Israel,
   They are estranged backwards.

   5 Why should I strike you any more?
   Ye will add faithlessness.
   The whole head is sickness,
   And the whole heart is faintness.

   6 From the sole of the foot even to the head
   There is no soundness in it;
   A wound, a swelling, And a purifying sore;
   And they have not been plastered, nor bound up,
   Nor softened with ointment.

   7 Your country is desolation;
   Your cities are burnt with fire;
   Your land do strangers devour in your presence,
   It is reduced to solitude, like the destruction of foreigners.

   8 And the daughter of Zion shall be left,
   As a cottage in a vineyard,
   As a lodge in a garden of cucumbers,
   As a city laid waste.

   9 Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a very small remnant,
   We should have been as Sodom,
   And like Gomorrah.

   10 Hear the word of the Lord, ye princes of Sodom!
   Give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah!
   Of what value to me is the multitude of your sacrifices?
   Saith the Lord.

   11 I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams,
   And of the fat of fed beasts;
   And in the blood of oxen, or of sheep, or of he-goats,
   I delight not.

   12 When you come that you may appear before my face,
   Who hath required this at your hand?
   Even to tread my courts.

   13 Do not continue to bring an offering of vanity.
   Incense is an abomination to me.
   The new-moon, And the sabbath, And the yearly assemblies,
   I cannot endure,
   (It is a vain thing,)
   Nor the assembly.

   14 Your new-moons And your yearly festivals
   My soul hateth;
   They have been a burden to me;
   I am weary of bearing them.

   15 When ye spread forth your hands,
   I will hide mine eyes from you.
   Even though you multiply prayer,
   I will not hear.
   Your hands are full of blood.

   16 Wash you, make you clean;
   Take away the wickedness of your practices from before mine eyes;
   Cease to do evil;

   17 Learn to do well:
   Seek judgment, restore [349] the oppressed;
   Plead for the orphan, defend the widow.

   18 Come now, and let us reason together,
   Hath the Lord said:
   If your sins be as scarlet,
   They shall be white as snow;
   If they be red like purple,
   They shall be as wool.

   19 If ye shall be willing and shall hearken,
   Ye shall eat the good of the land.

   20 But if ye shall refuse and rebel,
   Ye shall be consumed by the sword;
   For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.

   21 How is the faithful city become a harlot!
   She was full of judgment,
   And righteousness lodged by night [350] in her;
   But now murderers.

   22 Thy silver is become dross,
   And thy wine is mixed with water.

   23 Thy princes are rebellious,
   And are companions of thieves;
   Every one loveth a gift,
   And seeketh eagerly for rewards.
   They judge not the cause of the fatherless,
   Nor doth the cause of the widow come to them.

   24 Therefore saith the Lord, [351] Jehovah of hosts,
   The mighty One of Israel;
   Alas! I will take consolation on mine adversaries,
   I will be avenged of mine enemies.

   25 I will turn my hand upon thee;
   I will purely purge away thy dross,
   And I will take away all thy tin.

   26 And I will restore thy judges as at the first,
   And thy counsellors as at the beginning.
   Then shall it be said of thee,
   The city of righteousness,
   The faithful city.

   27 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment,
   And they who shall be brought back to her with righteousness.

   28 And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be
   together,
   And they who have revolted from the Lord shall be consumed.

   29 Yea, they shall be ashamed
   Of the trees which ye have desired,
   And they shall be covered with disgrace
   By the groves which ye have chosen.

   30 Ye shall surely be as a tree whose leaf fadeth,
   And as a grove that hath no water.

   31 And your strong man [352] shall be as tow,
   And the maker of it as a spark;
   And they shall both be burnt,
   And there shall be none to quench them.

   CHAPTER 2

   1 The word which Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw concerning Judah And
   Jerusalem.

   2 And it shall come to pass in the last of the days,
   That the mountain of the house of Jehovah
   Shall be established on the top of the mountains,
   And shall be exalted above the hills;
   And all nations shall flow to it.

   3 And many peoples shall come, and shall say,
   Come, and we shall go up
   To the mountain of Jehovah,
   To the house of the God of Jacob;
   And he will teach us in his ways,
   And we shall walk in his paths;
   For out of Zion shall go forth the law,
   And the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

   4 And he will judge among the nations,
   And will rebuke many peoples:
   And they shall beat their swords into spades,
   And their spears into pruning-hooks;
   And nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
   Neither shall they practise war any more.

   5 O house of Jacob, come ye,
   And we shall walk in the light of the Lord.

   6 Verily thou hast forsaken thy people, the house of Jacob;
   Because they are filled with the east [353]
   And with soothsayers, like the Philistines;
   And they have delighted in the children of foreigners.

   7 Their land is full of silver and gold,
   And there is no end to their treasures.
   Their land is also full of horses,
   And there is no end to their chariots.

   8 Their land is also full of idols,
   And they have bowed down
   Before the work of their own hands,
   Before that which their fingers have made.

   9 And the man of low degree boweth down,
   And the man of rank humbleth himself;
   Therefore do not thou forgive them. [354]

   10 Enter into the rock,
   Hide thee in the dust,
   From before the fear of the Lord
   And the glory of his majesty.

   11 The loftiness of the eyes of men shall be humbled,
   And the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down;
   And Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.

   12 For the day of Jehovah of hosts shall be
   On every one that is proud and lofty,
   And on all that is lifted up,
   And it shall be brought low.

   13 Even on all the cedars of Lebanon high and lifted up,
   On all the oaks of Bashan,

   14 And on all the lofty mountains,
   And on all the high hills,

   15 And on every lofty tower,
   And on every fortified wall;

   16 On all the ships of Tarshish,
   And on delightful pictures.

   17 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down,
   And the haughtiness of men shall be humbled;
   And Jehovah alone shall be exalted on that day.

   18 And he will utterly abolish the idols.

   19 And they shall enter into caverns of the rocks,
   And into clefts of the earth,
   From the presence of the terror of Jehovah,
   And from the glory of his majesty,
   When he shall arise to shake the earth.

   20 In that day shall a man cast away
   His idols of silver,
   And his idols of gold,
   Which they made for him to worship,
   Into the cavern of the moles and of the bats;

   21 And they shall enter into the clefts of the rocks,
   And into the tops of the ragged rocks,
   From before the fear of the Lord,
   And from the glory of his majesty,
   When he shall arise to shake the earth.

   22 Cease then from man,
   Whose breath is in his nostrils;
   For in what respect [355] is he valued?

   CHAPTER 3

   1 For, behold, the Governor, Jehovah of hosts,
   Will take away from Jerusalem and Judah
   The stay and the strength;
   The whole stay of bread;
   The whole stay of water;

   2 The strong man and the man of war,
   The judge and the prophet,
   And the diviner and the elder;

   3 The captain of fifty, and the man of rank,
   The senator, and the skilful artificer, and the eloquent. [356]

   4 And I will appoint boys to be their rulers,
   And babes shall rule over them.

   5 The people shall violently oppress each other,
   A man his neighbour;
   The youth shall behave insolently towards the old man,
   The despicable towards the honourable.

   6 When every man shall take hold of his brother
   Of the family of his father, saying,
   Thou hast raiment;
   Be thou our ruler;
   Let this ruin be under thy hand;

   7 He shall swear in that day, saying,
   I will not be a healer;
   For in my house is neither bread nor raiment;
   Therefore make me not a ruler of the people.

   8 Verily Jerusalem is ruined,
   And Judah is fallen;
   Because their tongue And their practices are against Jehovah,
   To provoke the eyes of his glory.

   9 The proof of their countenance answereth in them; [357]
   They have declared their sin, as Sodom,
   And have not hid it.
   Wo to their soul!
   For they have brought evil on them.

   10 Say ye to the righteous man,
   It shall be well;
   For they shall eat the fruit of their hands.

   11 Wo to the wicked man!
   It shall be ill;
   For according to the works of his hands
   Shall it be rewarded to him.

   12 Of my people children are oppressors,
   And women rule over them.
   O my people!
   They who govern thee lead thee astray,
   And pervert the way of thy paths.

   13 Jehovah standeth to plead,
   And standeth up to judge the people.

   14 Jehovah will enter into judgment
   With the elders of his people,
   And with their rulers;
   And ye have destroyed the vineyard,
   And the spoil of the poor is in your houses.

   15 What mean ye that ye crush my people,
   And grind the faces of the poor?
   Saith the Lord Jehovah of hosts.

   16 Jehovah also saith,
   Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,
   And walk with stretched-forth neck,
   And with wandering eyes,
   And walk and mince as they go,
   And make a tinkling with their feet.

   17 Therefore will the Lord make bald
   The crown of the head of the daughters of Zion,
   And the Lord will expose their shame.

   18 In that day will the Lord take away
   Ornaments that tinkled, or were made of net-work, or like a half-moon,

   19 Perfumes, bracelets, and head-hands;

   20 Bonnets, ornaments of the legs,
   Chaplets, neck-amulets, and ear-rings;

   21 Rings and nose-jewels,

   22 Changeable dresses, mantles,
   Upper garments, and hair-ties,

   23 Mirrors and fine linens,
   Hoods and veils.

   24 And instead of a sweet odour there shall be rottenness,
   And instead of a girdle, a rent,
   And instead of curled locks, baldness;
   Instead of a belt, a girdle of sackcloth,
   Instead of beauty, burning.

   25 Thy men shall fall by the sword,
   And thy might in the battle.

   26 Her gates shall lament and mourn,
   And she, desolate, shall sit on the ground.

   CHAPTER 4

   1 In that day, therefore, shall seven women
   Take hold of one man, saying,
   We will eat our own bread,
   We will wear our own raiment;
   Only let thy name be called on us, [358]
   And take thou away our reproach.

   2 In that day shall the branch of Jehovah
   Be for beauty and glory,
   And the fruit of the earth
   Be for excellence and comeliness,
   To the escaped of Israel.

   3 And it shall come to pass
   That he who shall be left in Zion,
   And shall remain in Jerusalem,
   Shall be called holy,
   And all shall be enrolled
   Among the living [359] at Jerusalem.

   4 When the Lord shall have washed away
   The filth of the daughter of Zion,
   And shall have cleansed the blood of Jerusalem
   From the midst of her,
   Both by the Spirit of judgment,
   And by the Spirit of burning.

   5 And Jehovah will create
   On every dwelling-place of Mount Zion,
   And on all her assemblies,
   A cloud and darkness by day,
   And the brightness of a flaming fire by night;
   For on all the glory shall be a defence.

   6 And a covering shall be by day
   For a shadow from the heat, and for refuge,
   And for a covert from storm and from rain.

   A song of my beloved to his vineyard.
   My beloved had a vineyard
   On a hill, the son of oil.

   2 He fenced it, and gathered out the stones,
   And planted it as a choice vine;
   He reared a tower in the midst of it,
   And built a wine-press in it:
   He therefore hoped that it would yield grapes,
   And it yieldeth wild grapes.

   3 Now then, O inhabitant of Jerusalem,
   And man of Judah,
   Judge ye between me and my vineyard.

   4 What more ought to have been done to my vineyard,
   Which I have not done to it?
   How did I look that it should yield grapes,
   And yet it hath yielded wild grapes?

   5 And now come, I will shew to you
   What I will do to my vineyard.
   I will take away its hedge, that it may become pasture;
   I will break down its wall, that it may be trodden down.

   6 I will lay it waste;
   It shall not be pruned nor digged;
   And the brier and thorn shall grow up.
   Yea, I will command the clouds
   That they do not rain on it.

   7 Verily the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel,
   And the men of Judah his pleasant plant.
   Hence he looked for judgment, and behold oppression;
   For righteousness, and behold a cry.

   8 Wo to them that join house to house,
   And add field to field,
   Till there be no place;
   That you may be placed alone
   In the midst of the earth.

   9 This is in the ears of Jehovah of hosts,
   If many houses be not laid desolate,
   Great and fair, without inhabitant.

   10 Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall produce one bath,
   And the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah.

   11 Wo to them that rise early
   To follow drunkenness,
   And who prolong the time till night,
   While wine inflameth them.

   12 And the harp, the lyre, the tabret, and the pipe, and wine
   Are in their entertainments;
   But they do not regard the work of Jehovah,
   Nor consider the operation of his hands.

   13 Therefore my people are gone into captivity,
   Because they have no knowledge;
   And their glory are men famished,
   And their multitude are dried up with thirst.

   14 Therefore hell hath enlarged his soul,
   And opened his mouth without measure;
   And his glory and his multitude hath descended,
   And his wealth, and he that rejoiced in her.

   15 And the man of low degree shall be bowed down,
   And the man of rank shall be humbled;
   Yea, the eyes of the haughty shall be humbled.

   16 And Jehovah of hosts shall be exalted in judgment,
   And God, who is holy, shall be sanctified in righteousness.

   17 And the lambs shall feed after their manner,
   And the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.

   18 Wo to them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity,
   And sin as with cart-ropes.

   19 Who say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work,
   That we may see it;
   Let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come,
   That we may know it.

   20 Wo to them that call evil good,
   And good evil;
   That put darkness for light,
   And light for darkness;
   That turn bitter into sweet,
   And sweet into bitter.

   21 Wo to them that are wise in their own eyes,
   And are prudent in their own sight.

   22 Wo to them that are powerful to drink wine,
   And powerful men to mingle strong drink;

   23 Who justify the wicked for reward,
   And take away the righteousness of the righteous from him.

   24 Therefore, as the tongue of fire devoureth the stubble,
   And the chaff is consumed by the flame;
   So their root shall be as rottenness,
   And their blossom shall pass away as dust;
   Because they have cast away the law of Jehovah of hosts,
   And have loathed the word of the Holy One of Israel.

   25 Therefore the anger of Jehovah
   Hath been kindled against his people,
   And, stretching forth his hand against them,
   He hath smitten them;
   And the mountains trembled,
   And their torn carcass was thrown into the midst of the streets;
   And for all these things his anger hath not been turned away,
   But his hand is stretched out still.

   26 And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from afar;
   He will hiss to the nation from the end of the earth;
   And lo, it will come speedy and swift.

   27 None shall be weary nor stumble among them;
   None shall slumber nor sleep;
   None shall have the girdle of their loins loosed,
   Nor shall the latchet of their shoes be broken.

   28 Their arrows will be sharp,
   And all their bows bent.
   The hoofs of their horses shall be counted as flint,
   And their wheels as a whirlwind.

   29 Their roaring shall be like that of a lion;
   They shall roar like young lions;
   They shall gnash and seize the prey;
   They shall carry away the spoils,
   And none shall deliver.

   30 He shall roar against them in that day, as the roaring of the sea;
   Then shall he look to the earth,
   And behold! the darkness of tribulation;
   And the light shall be darkened in the heavens.

   CHAPTER 6

   1 In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne
   high and lifted up, and his remotest parts filled the temple.

   2 And seraphim stood above it;
   Each had six wings;
   With two they covered their face,
   With two they covered their feet,
   And with two did they fly.

   3 And one cried to another, saying,
   Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of hosts;
   The whole earth is full of his glory.

   4 And the posts of the doors were moved by the voice of him that cried,
   And the house was filled with smoke.

   5 Then I said,
   Wo to me, for I am undone; [360]
   Because I am a man of polluted lips,
   And I dwell amidst a people having polluted lips;
   And yet mine eyes have seen the king, Jehovah of hosts.

   6 And one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a live coal,
   snatched with a fork from the altar.

   7 And laying it on my mouth, he said,
   Lo, this hath touched thy lips,
   And thy sin shall be expiated.

   8 Afterwards I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send?
   And who shall go for us? Then I said, Here am I, send me.

   9 Then he said,
   Go and tell this people:
   Hearing hear, and do not understand;
   Seeing see, and do not know.

   10 Harden the heart of this people,
   And make heavy their ears,
   And close up their eyes;
   Lest they see with their eyes,
   And hear with their ears,
   And their heart understand,
   And when they have been converted, they be healed.

   11 And I said, how long, O Lord. And he said,
   Till the houses be laid waste without inhabitant,
   And the houses be emptied of men,
   And the land be reduced to solitude;

   12 Till God have removed men far away,
   And till there be great desolation in the midst of the land:

   13 Till a tenth shall return,
   And be destroyed like a teil and an oak,
   Whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves;
   So in it shall the substance be the holy seed.

   CHAPTER 7

   1 It came to pass, in the days of Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of
   Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin, the king of Syria, and Pekah, the
   son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up against Jerusalem, to besiege
   it, but could not overcome it.

   2 And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is allied with
   Ephraim; and his heart was moved, as when the trees of the forest are
   moved by the wind.

   3 Then said Jehovah to Isaiah, Go out to meet Ahaz, thou and
   Shearjashub, thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, at
   the road of the fullers field.

   4 And thou shalt say to him:
   Take heed, and be quiet;
   Fear not, and let not thy heart be soft,
   For the two tails of those smoking firebrands,
   For the fierceness of the anger of Rezin the Syrian,
   And of the son of Remaliah.

   5 Because the Syrian hath taken wicked counsel against thee
   With Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, saying:

   6 Let us go up against Judah, and harass it,
   And let us open it for us;
   And let us appoint a king in the midst of it,
   The son of Tabeal.

   7 Thus hath the Lord Jehovah said,
   It shall not stand, and shall not be,

   8 For the head of Syria is Damascus,
   And the head of Damascus is Rezin;
   And within sixty-five years shall be broken
   Ephraim, that it be not a people.

   9 Yet the head of Ephraim is Samaria,
   And the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah.
   If ye do not believe,
   Surely ye shall not stand.

   10 And Jehovah added to speak to Ahaz, saying:

   11 Ask thee a sign from Jehovah thy God,
   By asking in the deep,
   Or in the height above.

   12 And Ahaz said, I will not ask, and I will not tempt the Lord.

   13 And he said,
   Hear now, O house of David!
   Is it a small thing for you to weary men,
   If ye do not also weary my God?

   14 Therefore will the Lord himself give you a sign:
   Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son,
   And shall call his name Immanuel.

   15 Butter and honey shall he eat,
   Till he know to refuse the evil,
   And to choose the good.

   16 And before the child shall know
   To refuse the evil and choose the good,
   Forsaken shall be the land which thou hatest
   By both her kings.

   17 Jehovah will bring upon thee,
   And on thy people, and on thy fathers house,
   Days which have not come
   Since the day of the revolt of Ephraim from Judah,
   The king of Assyria.

   18 It shall be in that day, Jehovah shall hiss
   For the fly, which is in the extremity of the rivers of Egypt,
   And for the bee which is in the land of Assyria.

   19 And they shall all of them come and rest
   In the desolate valleys, and in the caverns of the rocks,
   And on all thorns, and on all bushes.

   20 In that day shall Jehovah shave with a hired razor,
   By those who are beyond the river, by the king of Assyria,
   The head and the hair of the feet;
   And shall also take away the beard.

   21 And it shall be in that day, that a man shall nourish
   A young cow and two sheep.

   22 And it shall come to pass,
   That, on account of the abundance of milk which they shall yield,
   He shall eat butter.
   Yea, butter and honey shall every one eat
   That shall be left in the midst of the land.

   23 It shall also be in that day,
   That, wherever there are a thousand vines,
   They shall be sold for a thousand pieces of silver,
   On account of thorns and briers.

   24 With arrows and bow shall they come thither,
   Because thorns and briers shall be throughout all the land.

   25 And on all the mountains which are dug with the hoe
   Thither shall not come the dread of thorns and briers;
   But they shall be laid out for pasture to the cattle,
   And shall be trodden by the flocks.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 8

   1 And Jehovah said to me: Take thee a large roll, and write in it with
   an ordinary pen: [361] Make speed to spoil, hasten to the prey.

   2 And I took unto me faithful witnesses, Uriah the priest, and
   Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

   3 And I approached the prophetess, who conceived and bare a son. And
   Jehovah spake to me:
   Call his name,
   Make speed to spoil,
   Hasten to the prey.

   4 Verily before the child shall know
   To cry, My father and my mother,
   The riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria
   Shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.

   5 Moreover, Jehovah spoke unto me, saying again:

   6 Because this people hath refused
   The waters of Shiloah, which flow softly,
   And hath rejoiced in Rezin and the son of Remaliah:

   7 Therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth upon them
   The waters of the river, rapid and strong,
   The king of Assyria and all his force;
   And he shall come up over all his channels,
   And shall pass over all his banks.

   8 And, crossing over into Judah,
   He shall overflow and pass over;
   He shall reach even to the neck;
   And the stretching out of his wings shall fill
   The breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.

   9 Associate yourselves, ye peoples,
   And ye shall be broken in pieces;
   Give ear, all ye that are from a distant land.
   Gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces;
   Gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.

   10 Take counsel together, and it shall be disannulled;
   Decree a decree, and it shall not stand;
   For God is with us. [362]

   11 For thus did Jehovah speak to me, as if seizing [363] my hand,
   And taught me not to go in the way of this people, saying,

   12 Say ye not, A confederacy,
   In all things in which this people saith, A confederacy;
   And fear not their fear,
   Nor be ye afraid.

   13 Sanctify Jehovah of hosts himself;
   And let him be your fear,
   And let him be your dread.

   14 Then shall he be for a sanctuary;
   A stone of stumbling and rock of destruction
   To the two houses of Israel;
   A net and a snare
   To the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

   15 And many among them shall stumble, and fall,
   And shall be bruised, snared, and taken.

   16 Bind up the testimony;
   Seal the law among my disciples.

   17 Therefore will I wait for Jehovah,
   Who hideth his face from the house of Jacob,
   And I will look for him.

   18 Behold I, and the children whom Jehovah hath given me,
   Are for signs and wonders in Israel,
   From Jehovah of hosts,
   Who dwelleth in Mount Zion.

   19 And if they shall say to you,
   Inquire at soothsayers and diviners,
   Who whisper and mutter;
   Should not a people ask counsel of their God?
   From the living to the dead?

   20 To the law and to the testimony:
   If they have not spoken according to this word,
   It is because there is no light in them.

   21 Then shall they pass through this land distressed and hungry,
   And it shall happen that, when they are hungry, they shall fret,
   And shall curse their king and their God, looking upward.

   22 And when they shall look to the earth,
   Lo, trouble and darkness, dimness and distress,
   And they shall be driven to gloominess.

   CHAPTER 9

   1 Yet the darkness shall not be,
   According to the affliction which happened to her,
   When they first lightly afflicted
   The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali;
   Nor when they afterwards did more grievously afflict
   By the way of the sea beyond Jordan,
   In Galilee of the nations.

   2 The people walking in darkness
   Hath seen a great light.
   They who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death,
   Light hath shined on them.

   3 By multiplying the nation thou hast not increased the joy;
   They have rejoiced before thee according to the joy of harvest,
   As men shout in dividing the spoils.

   4 For his burdensome yoke,
   And the staff of his shoulder,
   The sceptre of his oppressor
   Hast thou broken, as in the day of Midian.

   5 Although every battle of the warrior is made
   With noise and rolling of the vesture in blood,
   This shall be for burning,
   For fuel of fire.

   6 For to us a child is born;
   To us a son is given;
   And the government hath been laid upon his shoulder;
   And his name shall be called, Wonderful, Counsellor,
   The mighty God, The Father of the age, The Prince of Peace.

   7 To the increase of the government and to peace,
   There shall be no end;
   On the throne of David and on his kingdom,
   To order and establish it
   In judgment and justice,
   Henceforth, even for ever.
   The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will do this.

   8 The Lord sent a word against Jacob,
   And it hath fallen on Israel.

   9 And all the people shall know,
   Ephraim, and the inhabitants of Samaria,
   Who say in the pride and haughtiness of their heart,

   10 The bricks are fallen down, and we will build with hewn stones;
   The sycamores are cut down, and we will substitute cedars.

   11 But Jehovah will strengthen the enemies of Rezin against him,
   And will aid his adversaries.

   12 Syria before, and the Philistines behind;
   And they shall devour Israel with open mouth.
   And for all this his anger is not turned away,
   But his hand is stretched out still.

   13 But the people have not turned to him that smote them,
   And have not sought Jehovah of hosts.

   14 Therefore will Jehovah cut off from Israel
   The head and the tail,
   The branch and the reed,
   In one day.

   15 The elder and the honourable, he is the head;
   And the prophet who teacheth falsehood, he is the tail.

   16 For the governors of this people are seducers,
   And they who are guided by them are destroyed.

   17 Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men,
   And will not have compassion on the orphans and widows;
   For all are hypocrites and evil-doers,
   And every mouth speaketh villany.
   For all this his anger is not turned away,
   But his hand is stretched out still.

   18 For wickedness burneth as the fire;
   It shall devour the briers and thorns;
   Afterwards it shall kindle into the thickets of the forest,
   And the smoke of that which ascendeth shall go up.

   19 Through the wrath of Jehovah of hosts
   Shall the land be darkened,
   And the people shall be as the fuel of fire:
   No man shall spare his brother.

   20 Every one shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry;
   He shall eat on the left hand, and shall not be satisfied;
   Every one shall devour the flesh of his own arm:

   21 Manasseh, Ephraim;
   And Ephraim, Manasseh;
   They together shall be against Judah.
   And yet for all this his anger is not turned away,
   But his hand is stretched out still.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 10

   1 Wo to them that decree unrighteous decrees,
   And who prescribing prescribe injustice:

   2 To keep back the poor from judgment,
   And to take away the right from the poor of my people,
   To defraud the widows,
   And to plunder the orphans.

   3 And what will ye do in the day of visitation?
   And when the desolation shall come from afar,
   To whom will ye flee for aid?
   And where will ye deposit [364] your glory?

   4 Unless [365] they shall stumble among the vanquished,
   And shall fall down among the slain.
   For all this his anger shall not be turned away,
   And his hand is stretched out still.

   5 O Assyrian! the rod of mine anger!
   And the very staff in their hand is my wrath.

   6 Against a hypocritical nation will I send him,
   And against the people of my indignation will I command him,
   To seize the prey,
   To carry off the spoils,
   And to tread him down as the mire of the streets.

   7 Yet will he not so intend,
   Nor will his heart think so;
   For it will be in his heart to destroy,
   And to cut off nations not a few.

   8 For he saith, Are not my princes also kings?

   9 Is not Calno as Carchemish?
   Is not Hamath as Arpad?
   Is not Samaria as Damascus?

   10 As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols,
   For their graven images excelled Jerusalem and Samaria.

   11 As I have done to Samaria and her idols,
   Shall I not do so to Jerusalem and her idols?

   12 But it shall come to pass,
   When the Lord shall have performed his whole work
   In mount Zion and Jerusalem,
   I will punish the fruit of the haughtiness of the heart of the king of
   Assyria,
   And the glory of the loftiness of his eyes.

   13 For he saith, By the strength of my hand have I done it;
   And by my wisdom; for I am sagacious;
   And therefore have I removed the boundaries of the peoples,
   And have plundered their treasures,
   And have brought down the inhabitants, like a mighty man.

   14 And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the peoples;
   And as eggs which have been left are gathered,
   So have also I gathered the whole earth;
   And there was none that moved the wing,
   Or opened the mouth, or chirped.

   15 Shall the axe boast against him that heweth with it?
   Shall the saw magnify itself against him that moveth it?
   Like the rising up of a rod against him that raiseth it,
   Like the risings up of a staff, as if it were not wood.

   16 Therefore will the Governor, Jehovah of hosts, send
   Against his fat ones leanness,
   And under his glory will kindle
   A burning, like the burning of a fire.

   17 And the light of Israel shall become a fire,
   And his Holy One shall become a flame;
   And it shall burn and devour
   His briers and thorns in one day.

   18 The glory of his forest and of his fruitful field,
   From the soul even to the flesh, will he consume;
   And it shall be as the fainting of a standard-bearer.

   19 And the remains of the wood of his forest
   Shall become a number,
   Such that a child may count them.

   20 It shall be in that day,
   The remnant of Israel,
   And they that are left of the house of Jacob,
   Shall not add to rely on him that smote them;
   For they shall rely on Jehovah,
   The Holy One of Israel, in truth.

   21 The remnant shall return, the remnant of Jacob,
   To the mighty God.

   22 For if thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea,
   A remnant of it shall return.
   The consumption decreed overfloweth righteousness. [366]

   23 For a consumption and consummation
   Doth the Lord Jehovah of hosts make
   In the midst of all the land.

   24 Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts:
   O my people, the inhabitants of Zion,
   Fear not the Assyrian.
   He will smite thee with a rod,
   And will lift up his staff against thee,
   After the pattern of Egypt.

   25 But yet a little while,
   And my rage and indignation
   Shall be discharged in their destruction.

   26 And Jehovah of hosts will stir up a scourge against him,
   According to the slaughter of Midian on the rock Oreb;
   And his rod shall be on the sea,
   And he will lift it up after the pattern of Egypt.

   27 And it shall come to pass in that day,
   That his burden shall be removed from thy shoulder,
   And his yoke from thy neck;
   And the yoke shall be destroyed
   From the face of the anointing.

   28 He is come to Aiath; he hath passed to Migron;
   At Michmash he will lay up thy baggage.

   29 They have crossed the ford; they have lodged by night at Geba;
   Ramah is terrified; Gibeah of Saul hath fled.

   30 Neigh with thy voice, O daughter of Gallim!
   Cause it to be heard at Laish, O poor Anathoth.

   31 Madmenah is removed;
   The inhabitants of Gebim have gathered themselves.

   32 Yet a day, when he shall remain at Nob,
   He will lift up his hand
   Against the mount of the daughter of Zion,
   The hill of Jerusalem.

   33 Behold! The Lord Jehovah of hosts
   Will cut off the branch with terror; [367]
   And the lofty of stature shall be cut down,
   And the haughty shall be brought low.

   34 And he will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron,
   And Lebanon shall fall violently.

   1 But a branch shall spring from the stock of Jesse,
   And a sprout from his roots shall yield fruit.

   2 And the Spirit of Jehovah shall rest upon him,
   The Spirit of wisdom and understanding,
   The Spirit of counsel and strength,
   The Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah;

   3 And will make him sagacious in the fear of Jehovah;
   Not according to the sight of his eyes shall he judge,
   Nor according to the hearing of his ears shall he reprove.

   4 For in righteousness he shall judge the poor,
   And in equity shall he reprove for the meek of the earth;
   And he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth,
   And with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.

   5 And righteousness shall be the belt of his loins,
   And faithfulness the belt of his reins.

   6 The wolf shall dwell with the lamb,
   And the leopard shall lie down with the kid;
   The calf, and the lion, and the fatling together;
   And a little child shall lead them.

   7 The cow and the bear shall feed;
   Their young ones shall lie down together;
   And the lion shall eat straw like the ox.

   8 And the child shall play on the hole of the asp,
   And on the dell of the basilisk shall the weaned child lay his hand.

   9 They shall not hurt, nor do injury,
   In all the mountain of my holiness;
   For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah,
   As with waters that cover the sea.

   10 And it shall be in that day, The root of Jesse,
   Which shall stand for an ensign of the peoples,
   Shall be sought by the nations;
   And his rest shall be glory.

   11 And it shall be in that day,
   The Lord will again apply his hand,
   To recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left,
   From Assyria, and from Egypt, from Parthia,
   From Arabia, from Ethiopia, from Persia,
   From Chaldea, from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.

   12 And he shall lift up an ensign to the nations,
   And shall gather the outcasts of Israel,
   And shall gather the dispersed of Judah,
   From the four corners of the earth.

   13 And the envy of Ephraim shall depart,
   And the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off.
   Ephraim shall not envy Judah,
   And Judah shall not vex Ephraim.

   14 But they shall fly on the shoulders of the Philistines to the west;
   They shall plunder together the children of the east;
   Edom and Moab shall be the stretching out of their hands,
   And the children of Ammon shall be their obedience.

   15 And Jehovah shall utterly destroy
   The tongue of the Egyptian sea;
   And he shall lift up his hand on the river
   By the might of his wind;
   And he shall smite it in the seven streams,
   And shall make them to be shod with shoes.

   16 And there shall be a path for the remnant of his people,
   Which shall be left from Assyria,
   As there was to Israel,
   In the day when he came up out of the land of Egypt.

   1 And in that day thou shalt say:
   I will sing to thee, O Jehovah;
   Though thou wast angry with me,
   Thine anger is turned away, and thou hast comforted me.

   2 Behold! God is my salvation;
   I will trust, and not be afraid;
   For God Jehovah is my strength and song;
   And he hath become [368] my salvation.

   3 Ye shall draw waters with joy
   From the fountains of the Saviour. [369]

   4 And in that day shall ye say:
   Sing to Jehovah; call upon his name;
   Make known his works among the peoples;
   Proclaim that his name is exalted.

   5 Sing to Jehovah;
   For he hath done glorious things;
   And this hath been made known throughout all the earth.

   6 Shout and sing,
   O inhabitress of Zion!
   For great in the midst of thee,
   Is the Holy One of Israel.

   CHAPTER 13

   1 The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw.

   2 On a lofty mountain lift up a banner;
   Raise the voice to them; shake the hand;
   That they may enter into the gates of the nobles.

   3 I have commanded my sanctified ones;
   And for mine anger have I also called my mighty ones,
   Who rejoice in my glory.

   4 The noise of a multitude in the mountains,
   As of a great people;
   The noise of the sound of kingdoms,
   Of nations gathered together;
   Jehovah of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.

   5 Coming from a distant land,
   From the end of heaven,
   Jehovah and the vessels of his anger,
   To destroy the whole land.

   6 Howl ye, for the day of Jehovah is at hand;
   As destruction from the Strong One [370] shall it come.

   7 Therefore shall all hands be weakened,
   And every heart of man shall melt.

   8 And they shall be afraid;
   Pangs And sorrows shall take hold of them;
   They shall be in pain like a woman in labour;
   Every one shall be amazed at his neighbour;
   Their faces shall be faces of flames.

   9 Behold! the day of Jehovah shall come cruel;
   Even indignation and the burning of anger,
   To lay the land desolate,
   And to destroy the sinners thereof out of it.

   10 Therefore the stars of heaven, and the constellations,
   Shall not give their light;
   The sun shall be darkened in his going forth,
   And the moon shall not give forth her brightness.

   11 And I will visit upon the world wickedness,
   And upon the wicked their iniquity;
   And I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease,
   And I will lay low the loftiness of tyrants.

   12 I will make a mortal more precious than fine gold,
   And a man than the weight of the gold of Ophir.

   13 Therefore I will shake the heavens,
   And the earth shall be moved out of its place,
   In the indignation of Jehovah of hosts,
   And in the day of the fierceness of his anger.

   14 And it shall be as a chased roe,
   And a sheep which no man taketh up;
   Every one shall look to his own people,
   And every one shall flee to his own land.

   15 Every one that is found shall be pierced through,
   And every one that is joined to them shall fall by the sword.

   16 Their infants shall be dashed in pieces before their eyes;
   Their houses shall be plundered,
   And their wives shall be ravished.

   17 Behold! I raise up against you the Medes,
   Who shall not think of silver,
   And shall not desire even gold.

   18 And with their bows shall they dash in pieces the children;
   They shall not pity the fruit of the womb,
   Nor shall their eye spare children.

   19 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms,
   And the ornament of the brightness of the Chaldeans,
   Shall be like God's overthrowing of Sodom And Gomorrah.

   20 Never shall it be inhabited any more,
   Nor shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation;
   Nor shall the Arabian pitch his tent there,
   Nor shall the shepherds make their flocks to lie down there.

   21 But the Ziim shall lie down there;
   And their houses shall be full of Ohim;
   There shall the daughters of the ostrich dwell,
   And there shall the satyrs dance.

   22 And Iim shall cry in their splendid houses,
   And dragons in their delightful palaces;
   And her time is near at hand,
   And her days shall not be prolonged.

   CHAPTER 14

   1 Jehovah will now pity Jacob,
   And will yet choose Israel,
   And will cause them to rest in their own land;
   And the stranger shall be joined to them;
   They shall be allied to the house of Jacob.

   2 And the peoples shall take them,
   And shall bring them to their own place,
   And in the land of Jehovah shall the house of Israel
   Possess them for servants and for handmaids;
   And they shall take them whose captives they were,
   And shall rule over their oppressors.

   3 And it shall be in the day,
   When Jehovah shall have given thee rest
   From thy labour,
   And from thy trembling,
   And from the hard bondage which had been laid on thee.

   4 Then against the king of Babylon
   Shalt thou take up this proverb, and shalt say,
   How hath the oppressor ceased!
   How hath the city covetous of gold ceased!

   5 Jehovah hath broken the staff of the wicked,
   The sceptre of the rulers,

   6 Which smote the nations in anger,
   With an incurable wound;
   Which ruled over the nations with anger;
   If any one suffered persecution,
   He did not hinder it.

   7 The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet;
   They have sung praise.

   8 Yea, the fir-trees rejoice over thee,
   And the cedars of Lebanon:
   Since thou art laid down,
   No feller hath come up against us.

   9 Hell from beneath is moved on account of thee;
   To meet thy coming
   He hath stirred up the dead for thee,
   And hath made to rise from their thrones
   All the leaders of the earth,
   All the kings of the nations.

   10 All shall speak, and say to thee:
   Art thou also become weak as we?
   And art thou become like to us?

   11 In the grave is laid thy splendour,
   And the noise of thine instruments of music;
   The worm is spread under thee,
   And reptiles cover thee.

   12 How art thou fallen from heaven,
   O Lucifer, son of the dawn!
   How art thou thrown down to the earth,
   That didst cast the lot upon the nations! [371]

   13 But thou saidst in thy heart,
   I will ascend to heaven;
   In high places near the stars of God
   Will I place my throne,
   And will sit on the mountain of the testimony,
   On the sides of the north.

   14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds,
   And will be like the Most High.

   15 But thou art brought down to the grave,
   To the sides of the pit.

   16 They that see thee shall bend forward,
   And shall view thee attentively.
   Is this the man that made the earth to tremble?
   That shook the kingdoms?

   17 That made the world as a wilderness;
   That destroyed its cities?
   That opened not the house to his prisoners?

   18 All the kings of the nations, all of them,
   Lie in glory, each in his own house.

   19 But thou art cast out of thy grave,
   As an abominable branch,
   As the garments of the slain
   Who were killed with the sword,
   Who go down to the pit;
   As a carcase trodden under foot.

   20 Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial;
   Because thou hast laid waste thy land,
   Thou hast slain thy people;
   The seed of wicked men shall not be continually remembered.

   21 Prepare slaughter for his children,
   For the iniquity of their fathers;
   That they may not rise, and possess the land,
   And fill the face of the world with cities.

   22 For I will rise up against them, saith Jehovah of hosts,
   And the name and the remnant,
   The son and the grandson,
   Will I cut off, saith Jehovah.

   23 And I will make it to be a possession of the hedgehog,
   And pools of water;
   And I will sweep it with a besom, emptying it,
   Saith Jehovah of hosts.

   24 Jehovah of hosts hath sworn, saying,
   If it hath not been as I thought,
   And if it shall not stand as I purposed,

   25 That in my land I will crush the Assyrian,
   And on my mountains will tread him under foot;
   And that his yoke shall depart from them,
   And his burden be removed from their shoulder.

   26 This is the purpose which is purposed on the whole earth;
   And this hand is stretched out on all the nations.

   27 For Jehovah of hosts hath decreed, and who shall disannul it?
   His hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?

   28 In the year in which Ahaz the king died, was this burden.

   29 Rejoice not, thou whole Palestina,
   Because the rod of him that smote thee is broken;
   For from the root of the adder shall spring a cockatrice,
   And his fruit shall be a fiery serpent.

   30 And the first-born of the poor shall feed,
   And the needy shall lie down in safety;
   And I will cause thy root to die with famine,
   And he shall slay thy remnant.

   31 Howl, O gate! cry, O city!
   Thou whole Palestina art dissolved;
   For smoke cometh from the north;
   And no one shall be alone in his appointed day.

   32 And what shall be answered to the messengers of the nations?
   That Jehovah hath founded Zion,
   And the poor of his people shall have confidence in her.

   1 The burden of Moab.
   Because in the night Ar of Moab
   Is laid waste, and brought to silence;
   Surely in the night Kir of Moab
   Is laid waste, and brought to silence.

   2 He shall go up into the house, and to the high places of Dibon, to
   weep;
   Over Nebo, and over Medeba, shall Moab howl.
   On all his heads shall be baldness,
   And every beard shall be shaved.

   3 In his cross-roads shall they be girded with sackcloth;
   On his roofs, and in his streets,
   Shall every one howl, and go down to weep.

   4 Heshbon and Elealeh shall cry aloud;
   As far as Jahaz shall their voice be heard;
   Therefore shall the armed men of Moab howl;
   The soul of each man shall howl to itself.

   5 My heart shall cry aloud for Moab;
   Her fugitives to Zoar, a heifer of three years old;
   By the going up of Luhith shall they go up with weeping,
   By the way of Horonaim shall they raise the cry of sorrow.

   6 The waters of Nimrim are cut off;
   The grass is withered,
   The herbage hath failed,
   No verdure is left.

   7 Therefore what every one hath left, and his riches,
   They shall carry to the brook of the willows. [372]

   8 The cry hath gone round the borders of Moab;
   Even to Eglaim is his howling.
   And even to Beer-Elim is his howling.

   9 Because the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood;
   For I will lay additions upon Dimon,
   Lions to them that are escaped of Moab,
   And to the remnant of the land.

   CHAPTER 16

   1 Send ye the lamb to the governor of the land,
   From the rock of the desert
   To the mountain of the daughter of Zion.

   2 And it shall be as a bird let loose, wandering from its nest,
   So shall the daughters of Moab be at the fords of Arnon.

   3 Assemble a council; execute judgment;
   Make thy shadow as the night in the midst of noon-day;
   Hide the banished;
   Betray not the fugitive.

   4 Let mine outcasts dwell with thee.
   Moab, be thou a place of concealment
   From the face of the destroyer;
   For the extortioner hath ceased;
   The destroyer hath failed;
   He that trod us under foot hath been consumed out of the land.

   5 And in mercy shall the throne be prepared;
   And he shall sit upon it in steadfastness,
   To judge in the tabernacle of David,
   And to seek judgment,
   And to hasten righteousness.

   6 We have heard of the pride of Ahab, (he is very proud,)
   His pride, his haughtiness, and his insolence; [373]
   But his lies shall not be successful.

   7 Therefore shall Moab howl to Moab, all shall howl,
   On account of the foundations of Kirhareseth;
   You will groan, being only smitten.

   8 For the vines of Heshbon are cut down,
   The vine of Sibmah.
   The lords of the nations have trodden down her choicest roots, [374]
   Which reached even to Jazer,
   Which wandered even to the wilderness;
   Her noble plants have been thrown down,
   Which crossed the sea.

   9 Therefore will I bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah;
   I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh!
   Because on thy summer fruits, and on thy harvest,
   A shouting shall break forth. [375]

   10 Joy and rejoicing have been taken away from the fruitful field;
   In the vineyards shall there be no rejoicing nor shouting.
   The treader shall not tread wine in the presses;
   I have made the shouting to cease.

   11 Therefore my bowels shall sound like a harp for Moab,
   And my inward parts for Kirharesh.

   12 And it shall be, when it shall be seen
   That Moab hath been wearied on the high places,
   Then shall he come to the sanctuary to pray,
   And shall not profit by it.

   13 This is the word which Jehovah uttered concerning Moab since that
   time.

   14 Now, I say, Jehovah hath spoken, saying --
   Three years, as the years of a hireling;
   And the glory of Moab,
   With all her multitude, however great,
   Shall be turned into disgrace;
   And her remnant shall be few, small, and feeble.

   CHAPTER 17

   1 The burden of Damascus.
   Behold, Damascus is taken away, that it be not a city;
   For it shall be a heap of ruins.

   2 The cities of Aroer are forsaken;
   They shall be changed into sheepfolds;
   They shall lie down,
   And there shall be none to terrify them.

   3 And the fortress shall cease from Ephraim,
   And the kingdom from Damascus;
   And the remnant of Syria shall be
   As the glory of the children of Israel,
   Saith Jehovah of hosts.

   4 And it shall be in that day,
   The glory of Jacob shall be diminished,
   And the fatness of his flesh shall become lean.

   5 And it shall be as he who gathereth the harvest of the corn,
   Who reapeth the ears with his arm,
   Like as one gleaneth grapes in the valley of Rephaim.

   6 And in thee shall be left a gleaning, as the shaking of an
   olive-tree;
   There two or three berries remain on the top of the highest branch,
   Four or five on the spreading branches of its fruit,
   Saith Jehovah, the God of Israel.

   7 In that day shall a man look to his Maker,
   And his eyes shall be fixed on the Holy One of Israel.

   8 And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his own hands.
   Nor view the things which his fingers have made,
   Nor the groves,
   Nor the graven images.

   9 In that day the cities of his strength shall be
   As the forsaking of a thicket and of a branch,
   In like manner as they left before the children of Israel;
   And there shall be desolation.

   10 Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation,
   And hast not been mindful of the God of thy strength;
   Therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants,
   And thou shalt ingraft a foreign shoot.

   11 In the day of thy plantation shalt thou make it to grow,
   And in the morning thou shalt make thy seed to sprout;
   But in the day of enjoying shall the harvest fail,
   And the grief shall be desperate.

   12 Alas! the multitude of many peoples;
   Like the sound of many peoples shall they sound,
   And like the noise of nations;
   Like the noise of mighty waters shall they rush.

   13 Like the noise of mighty waters
   Shall the peoples make a noise,
   And he will rebuke them,
   And will drive them far away;
   They shall be chased
   As the chaff of the mountains before the wind,
   And as a rolling thing before the whirlwind.

   14 In the evening time, behold! trouble:
   Ere it be morning, it shall not at all be.
   This is the portion of them that tread us down,
   And the lot of them that plunder us.

   CHAPTER 18

   1 Alas! the land shadowing with wings,
   Which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia.

   2 Sending ambassadors by the sea,
   In ships of reeds on the waters.
   Go, ye swift messengers,
   To a nation scattered and plundered,
   To a people terrible from that time and till now,
   To a nation trodden down on every side,
   Whose land the rivers have plundered.

   3 All ye inhabitants of the world,
   And dwellers on the earth,
   When he shall set up a standard on the mountains, you shall see it;
   When he shall sound a trumpet, you shall hear it.

   4 Thus also hath Jehovah said to me,
   I will rest, and will look in my tabernacle,
   As the heat that drieth up the rain,
   And as a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.

   5 For when the harvest shall be at hand,
   The bud shall be perfect,
   And the ripening fruit shall go out of the flower;
   Then will he prune the twigs with pruning-hooks,
   And cut down and take away the branches.

   6 They shall be left together to the fowls of the mountains,
   And to the beasts of the earth.
   The fowls shall spend the summer upon them,
   And all the beasts of the earth shall spend the winter upon them.

   7 At that time shall a present be brought to Jehovah of hosts,
   A people torn and plundered,
   And from a people terrible from the beginning hitherto;
   From a nation trodden down on every side,
   Whose land the rivers have plundered,
   To the place of the name of Jehovah of hosts,
   To Mount Zion.

   CHAPTER 19

   1 The burden of Egypt.
   Behold, Jehovah rideth on a swift cloud,
   And will come into Egypt;
   And the idols of Egypt shall be moved before his face,
   And the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of her.

   2 And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians;
   Then shall they fight every one against his brother,
   Every one against his neighbour;
   City against city,
   And kingdom against kingdom.

   3 And the spoil of Egypt shall be emptied in the midst of her,
   And I will destroy her counsel,
   Even though they seek to the idols, to the magicians,
   To the soothsayers, to the diviners.

   4 And I will deliver the Egyptians, into the hand of a cruel master,
   And a powerful king shall rule over them,
   Saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.

   5 Then shall the waters fail from the sea,
   And the flood shall be wasted and dried up.

   6 The rivers shall be turned aside;
   The brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up;
   The reed and the flag shall wither.

   7 The herbs at the brook, and on the mouth of the brook,
   And all the seed of the river,
   Shall wither, and be driven away, that it may be no more.

   8 And the fishers shall mourn,
   And all who cast a hook into the brook shall lament;
   They who spread a net on the face of the waters shall anguish.

   9 They who work in the finest flax shall blush,
   And they who weave perforated [376] meshes.

   10 For their nets shall be broken,
   And all that make a net shall be sad in their heart.

   11 Surely the princes of Zoan are fools;
   The counsel of the wise counsellors of Pharaoh is foolish.
   How say ye to Pharaoh,
   I am the son of the wise,
   And the son of ancient kings?

   12 Where are now thy wise men?
   That they may declare to thee,
   Or that they may even know,
   What Jehovah of hosts hath decreed concerning Egypt.

   13 The princes of Zoan are become infatuated,
   The princes of Noph are deceived;
   Egypt hath been led astray
   By a corner of her tribes.

   14 Jehovah hath mingled a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her;
   And they have misled Egypt in all her work,
   As a drunken man staggereth in his vomit.

   15 Neither shall Egypt have any work to do,
   The head or the tail,
   The branch or the rush.

   16 In that day shall Egypt be like women;
   For it shall shudder and tremble,
   From before the shaking of the hand of Jehovah of hosts,
   Which he shall shake over it.

   17 And to the Egyptians shall the land of Judah be a terror.
   Every one that shall mention it
   Shall tremble on account of her,
   Because of the purpose of Jehovah of hosts,
   Which he hath decreed concerning her.

   18 In that day shall there be five cities in the land of Egypt,
   Speaking with the lip of Canaan,
   And swearing by Jehovah of hosts.
   One shall be called, The city of desolation.

   19 In that day shall there be
   An altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt,
   And a statue to Jehovah near its border.

   20 And it shall be for a sign and for a witness
   To Jehovah of hosts, in the land of Egypt;
   For they shall cry to Jehovah because of the oppressors,
   And he will send to them a saviour,
   And a ruler, that he may deliver them.

   21 And Jehovah shall be known by the Egyptians;
   The Egyptians shall know Jehovah in that day,
   And shall make sacrifice and oblation,
   And shall vow vows to Jehovah, and perform them.

   22 Therefore will the Lord smite Egypt,
   Smiting and healing;
   For they shall be turned to Jehovah,
   And he will be entreated by them,
   And will heal them.

   23 In that day shall there be a way from Egypt into Assyria;
   The Assyrians shall go into Egypt,
   And the Egyptians into Assyria;
   And the Egyptians shall serve the Assyrians. [377]

   24 In that day shall Israel be,
   With Egypt and with Assyria,
   The third blessing in the midst of the land.

   25 For Jehovah of hosts will bless him, saying,
   Blessed be the Egyptian, my people,
   And the Assyrian, the work of my hands,
   And Israel, my inheritance.

   1 In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, (when Sargon, the king of
   Assyria, sent him,) and attacked Ashdod, and took it.

   2 At that time Jehovah spoke by the hand of Isaiah, the son of Amoz,
   saying,
   Go and loose the sackcloth from thy loins,
   And put off thy shoe from thy foot.

   3 And he did so, walking naked and barefooted. And Jehovah said:
   As my servant Isaiah for three years
   Hath walked naked and barefooted,
   A sign and a wonder
   Concerning Egypt and concerning Ethiopia;

   4 So will the king of Assyria lead away the captivity of Egypt,
   And the removal of Ethiopia,
   Of the young and of the old,
   Naked and barefooted,
   And with their hinder parts uncovered,
   To the disgrace of Egypt.

   5 And they shall be afraid and ashamed
   Of Ethiopia their expectation,
   And of Egypt their glory. [378]

   6 And in that day shall the inhabitant of this island say,
   Behold! what is become of our expectation,
   To which we fled for aid,
   That we might be delivered from the face of the king of Assyria;
   And how shall we escape?

   1 The burden of the desert of the sea.
   As storms that pass from a southerly direction,
   It will come from the wilderness,
   From a terrible land.

   2 A harsh vision hath been declared to me,
   The transgressor to the transgressor,
   And the plunderer to the plunderer.
   Go up, O Persian! Besiege, O Mede!
   All his groaning have I made to cease.

   3 Therefore are my loins filled with pain;
   Pangs have seized me, as the pangs of a woman in labour;
   I am bowed down at hearing,
   And am dismayed at seeing.

   4 My heart is shaken;
   Terror hath overwhelmed me;
   The night of my pleasures
   He hath changed to terror.

   5 Prepare the table;
   Watch in the watch-tower;
   Eat, drink;
   Arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.

   6 For thus hath the Lord said to me:
   Go, appoint a watchman,
   That he may declare what he seeth.

   7 And he saw a chariot of a couple of horsemen,
   A chariot of an ass, and a chariot of a camel;
   Next, he looked attentively,
   And watched eagerly.

   8 Then he cried, A lion.
   On my watch-tower, my lord, I continually stand by day,
   And in my ward am I stationed whole nights.

   9 And behold, here cometh a chariot of a man,
   A couple of horsemen.
   And he spake, and said,
   Babylon is fallen, is fallen!
   And all the graven images of her gods
   Hath he broken to the ground.

   10 O my thrashing, and the corn of my floor!
   I have related to you what I have heard
   From Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel.

   11 The burden of Dumah.
   He calleth to me out of Seir:
   Watchman, what of the night?
   Watchman, what of the night?

   12 The watchman said:
   The morning cometh, afterwards the night.
   If ye will inquire, inquire ye.
   Return, come.

   13 The burden in Arabia.
   In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge,
   In the ways of Dedanim.

   14 To meet the thirsty bring waters,
   O inhabitants of the land of Tema!
   Relieve the fugitive with thy bread.

   15 For they flee from the face of the swords,
   From the face of the drawn sword,
   From the face of the bent bow,
   From the face of the grievousness of war.

   16 For thus hath the Lord said to me:
   Yet a year, according to the years of a hireling,
   Then shall all the glory of Kedar fail;

   17 And then shall be diminished the number of the archers,
   Which shall be reckoned among the mighty sons of Kedar;
   For Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath spoken it.

   CHAPTER 22

   1 The burden of the valley of vision.
   What hast thou here, [379]
   That thou art entirely gone up upon the roofs?

   2 Full of miseries,
   Tumultuous city, joyful city;
   Thy slain men are not slain by the sword,
   And are not dead in battle.

   3 All thy rulers have fled;
   Together have they been made prisoners by the archers;
   All that were found in thee have been made prisoners together,
   Who have fled from afar.

   4 Therefore I said, Let me alone;
   I will be bitter in my weeping;
   Labour not to comfort me
   Because of the plundering of the daughters of my people.

   5 For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity,
   From the Lord Jehovah of hosts, in the valley of vision,
   Demolishing the city,
   And crying to the mountain.

   6 Yet Elam beareth the quiver
   In a chariot of men and horsemen,
   And Kir uncovereth the shield.

   7 And the choice of thy valleys was filled with chariots,
   And horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.

   8 And he took away the covering of Judah;
   And thou didst look in that day
   To the armory of the house of the forest.

   9 And ye have seen the breaches of the city of David, which were many;
   And ye collected the waters of the lower pool.

   10 And the houses of Jerusalem have ye numbered,
   And ye have thrown down houses to fortify the wall.

   11 For the waters of the old pool
   Have ye also made a ditch between the walls;
   And ye have not looked to him that made it,
   And have not seen him that formed it in ancient times. [380]

   12 And in that day the Lord, Jehovah of hosts,
   Called to weeping and to lamentation,
   To baldness and girding with sackcloth;

   13 And, behold! joy and gladness,
   Slaying oxen, killing sheep,
   Eating flesh, and drinking wine,
   Eating and drinking;
   For tomorrow we shall die!

   14 It was revealed in my ears by Jehovah of hosts,
   If this iniquity shall be forgiven you till ye die,
   Saith the Lord Jehovah of hosts.

   15 Thus saith the Lord Jehovah of hosts,
   Go, approach to that abettor,
   To Shebna, the ruler of the house.

   16 What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here?
   That thou hast hewed out here for thyself a sepulchre,
   As he who heweth out his sepulchre on high,
   Or who cutteth out a habitation for himself in the rock.

   17 Behold, Jehovah will carry thee away with a remarkable carrying
   away,
   And covering will cover thee.

   18 Whirling he will turn thee with whirling,
   As a ball with the hands, into a distant country;
   There shalt thou die;
   And there the chariot of thy glory
   Shall be the disgrace of the house of thy lord.

   19 And I will drive thee from thy post,
   And from thy abode shall he east thee out.

   20 And it shall be in that day, I will call my servant,
   Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah.

   21 And I will clothe him with thy raiment,
   And will strengthen him with thy girdle,
   And will deliver thy power into his hand;
   And he shall be a father of the inhabitant of Jerusalem,
   And of the house of Judah.

   22 And I will lay the key of the house of David upon his shoulder;
   He will open, and none shall shut;
   He will shut, and none shall open.

   23 And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place,
   And to the house of his father he shall become a throne of glory.

   24 And all the glory of his fathers house,
   Grandchildren and great-grandchildren,
   All smaller vessels,
   From vessels of cups to all vessels of musical instruments,
   They shall hang upon him.

   25 In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts,
   The nail fixed in a sure place shall be removed,
   And shall be cut down, and shall fall;
   And the burden which was upon it shall be cut off;
   For Jehovah hath spoken it.

   CHAPTER 23

   1 The burden of Tyre.
   Howl, ye ships of Tarshish;
   For desolation has been made,
   So that there is no house,
   That there is no entering in from the land of Chittim.
   This was revealed to them.

   2 Be silent, ye inhabitants of the islands,
   The merchant of Sidon; they that crossed the sea;
   Who supplied thee.

   3 By great waters was the seed of the Nile;
   Her fruits were the harvest of the river;
   And she was a mart of nations.

   4 Be ashamed, O Sidon;
   For the sea hath spoken,
   The strength of the sea, saying,
   I have not conceived nor brought forth,
   And I have not brought up young men,
   And have not reared virgins.

   5 As soon as the report shall reach the Egyptians,
   They shall be grieved according to the report of Tyre.

   6 Pass ye over to Tarshish;
   Howl, ye inhabitants of the islands.

   7 Is this your exulting city?
   From ancient days is her antiquity.
   Her feet shall carry her,
   To travel into a distant country.

   8 Who hath consulted this concerning crowning Tyre,
   Whose merchants are princes,
   Whose traders are the nobles of the land?

   9 Thus hath Jehovah of hosts decreed,
   To profane the pride of all that are illustrious,
   To bring into contempt all the renowned of the land.

   10 Cross over from thy land, like a river,
   To the daughter of Tarshish;
   For there is no longer any girdle.

   11 He laid his hand upon the sea,
   He shook kingdoms.
   Jehovah hath commanded concerning Canaan,
   To weaken her strength.

   12 And he saith, O virgin daughter of Sidon,
   When thou shalt be oppressed,
   Thou shalt not add any more to rejoice.
   Arise, that thou mayest pass over into Chittim;
   Yet even there thou shalt not have rest.

   13 Behold, the land of the Chaldeans;
   This was not a people;
   Assyria founded it for the inhabitants of the wilderness;
   They have reared its fortresses;
   They have built its palaces;
   He hath reduced it to desolation.

   14 Howl, ye ships of Tarshish;
   For your strength is laid waste.

   15 It shall come to pass in that day,
   That Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years,
   According to the days of one king;
   At the end of seventy years
   Shall Tyre have a song like that of a harlot.

   16 Take a harp, go about the city,
   O harlot, devoted to forgetfulness!
   Make sweet melody, multiply song,
   That thou mayest be kept in remembrance.

   17 It shall then be at the end of seventy years,
   That Jehovah will visit Tyre;
   And then shall she return to her hire,
   And shall commit fornication
   With all the kingdoms of the earth
   Which are upon the earth.

   18 Yet her merchandise and her hire
   Shall be holy to Jehovah;
   It shall not be treasured nor laid up;
   But her merchandise shall be
   For them that dwell before Jehovah,
   That they may eat sufficiently,
   And may have a thick covering.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 24

   1 Behold, Jehovah emptieth the earth,
   Maketh it bare,
   Overturneth its face,
   And scattereth its inhabitants.

   2 And it shall be, as the people, so the priest;
   As the servant, so his master;
   As the maid, so her mistress;
   As the buyer, so the seller;
   As the lender, so the borrower;
   As the usurer, so he that giveth usury. [381]

   3 By emptying shall the earth be emptied,
   And by plundering shall it be plundered;
   For Jehovah hath spoken this word.

   4 The earth hath lamented, and hath fallen;
   The world hath languished, and hath fallen;
   They who were the lofty people of the earth have languished.

   5 And the earth hath been deceitful under its inhabitants;
   Because they have transgressed the laws,
   They have changed the ordinance,
   They have broken the covenant of eternity.

   6 Therefore hath the curse consumed the earth,
   And its inhabitants are made desolate;
   Therefore are the inhabitants of the earth burned,
   And few men have been left.

   7 The wine hath failed;
   The vine hath languished;
   All who were of joyful heart have groaned.

   8 The joy of tabrets hath ceased,
   The noise of them that exult is ended,
   The mirth of the harp is silent.

   9 They shall not drink wine with a song;
   Strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.

   10 The city of vanity is broken down;
   Every house is shut up, that none may enter.

   11 There is a cry about wine in the streets;
   All joy is darkened;
   The mirth of the land hath departed.

   12 Desolation is left in the city,
   And the gate is smitten with desolation.

   13 For in the midst of the land,
   In the midst of the peoples,
   Thus shall it be as the shaking of an olive-tree,
   And as the shaking of the grapes, when the vintage is ended.

   14 They shall lift up their voice;
   They shall shout for the majesty of the Lord;
   They shall cry aloud from the sea.

   15 Therefore glorify ye Jehovah in the valleys,
   The name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the isles of the sea.

   16 From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs,
   Glory to the Righteous One!
   And I said, I have leanness! I have leanness! Wo to me!
   The treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously;
   With treachery have the treacherous dealers dealt treacherously.

   17 Fear, and the pit, and the snare,
   Are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth!

   18 And it shall come to pass,
   That he who fleeth from the voice of fear,
   Shall fall into the pit,
   And he who goeth up out of the midst of the pit
   Shall be taken in the snare;
   For the windows from on high are opened,
   And the foundations of the earth are shaken.

   19 By bruising is the earth bruised;
   By breaking down is the earth broken down;
   By shaking is the earth shaken.

   20 With reeling doth the earth reel, like a drunkard;
   And it shall be removed, like a tabernacle;
   And its transgression shall be heavy upon it;
   And it shall fall, and shall not add to rise again.

   21 And it shall be in that day,
   Jehovah will visit
   Upon the high army on high,
   And upon the kings of the earth on the earth.

   22 And with gathering together shall they be gathered together
   Like prisoners in a dungeon;
   And they shall be shut up in a prison;
   Afterwards at the end of many days shall they be visited.

   23 The moon shall be confounded,
   And the sun shall be ashamed,
   When Jehovah of hosts shall reign
   In Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem;
   And before his elders glory.

   CHAPTER 25

   1 O Jehovah, thou art my God;
   I will exalt thee;
   I will praise thy name;
   For thou hast done a wonderful thing;
   Counsels which have been already decreed of old;
   Firm truth.

   2 For thou hast made of a city a heap;
   A fortified city to be a ruin;
   A palace of foreigners, that it may not be a city,
   That it may never be built.

   3 Therefore shall the mighty people glorify thee;
   The city of the powerful nations shall fear thee.

   4 For thou hast been strength to the poor;
   Strength to the needy in his affliction;
   A refuge from the flood,
   A shadow from the heat;
   For the breath of the strong [382] ones
   Was as a storm [383] against the wall.

   5 As the heat in a dry place,
   Thou wilt lay low the noise of foreigners,
   As the heat by the shadow of a cloud;
   The shouting [384] of the strong ones wilt thou lay low.

   6 And Jehovah of hosts will make
   For all people in that mountain
   A feast of fat things,
   A feast of liquids purified,
   Of fat things full of marrow,
   Of liquids purified.

   7 And he will destroy in that mountain
   The face of the covering with which all nations were covered,
   And the veil which was spread over all nations.

   8 He hath destroyed death eternally.
   And the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from all faces,
   And will take away the disgrace of his people from all the earth;
   For Jehovah hath spoken it.

   9 And it shall he said in that day:
   Lo, this is our God;
   We have waited for him,
   And he will save us;
   This is Jehovah;
   We have waited for him;
   We will rejoice and be glad in his salvation.

   10 For the hand of Jehovah shall rest on that mountain;
   And Moab shall be trodden down under him,
   As straw is trodden down on the dunghill.

   11 And he will spread out his hand under the midst of them,
   As a swimmer spreadeth forth his hands to swim;
   And he will lay low their pride,
   With the arms of their hands.

   12 And the fortress of the loftiness of thy walls
   He will bring down,
   He will lay low,
   And he will cast down to the ground,
   To the dust.

   CHAPTER 26

   1 In that day shall a song be sung in the land of Judah;
   We have a city of strength;
   He hath made salvation to be walls and a rampart.

   2 Open ye the gates,
   And the righteous nation shall enter,
   Which keepeth the truth.

   3 The thought is fixed;
   Thou wilt keep peace, peace;
   For they have trusted in thee.

   4 Hope ye in Jehovah for ever;
   For in Jah Jehovah is the strength of ages.

   5 For he will bow down the inhabitants of loftiness;
   He will lay low the elevated city;
   He will lay it low to the ground;
   He will bring it to the dust.

   6 The foot shall tread it down;
   The feet of the poor,
   The steps of the needy.

   7 Straightnesses are the path of the righteous man;
   The straight way of the righteous man thou wilt weigh. [385]

   8 Even in the way of thy judgments, O Jehovah,
   We have waited for thee;
   To thy name,
   And to the remembrance of thee,
   Is the desire of the soul.

   9 My soul hath desired thee in the night;
   Yea, with my spirit within me I will seek thee in the morning; [386]
   For so soon as thy judgments shall be in the earth,
   The inhabitants of the earth shall learn righteousness.

   10 The wicked man will obtain favour,
   And will not learn righteousness;
   In the land of upright actions he will deal unjustly,
   And will not behold the majesty of Jehovah.

   11 Jehovah, though thy hand is lifted up,
   They will not see;
   They shall see, and be ashamed,
   Through their envy of the people;
   Yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.

   12 O Jehovah, thou wilt ordain peace for us;
   For thou also hast wrought all our works for us.

   13 O Jehovah our God,
   Lords besides thee have had dominion over us;
   By thee only will we call thy name to remembrance.

   14 The dead shall not live;
   The slain shall not rise again;
   Therefore thou hast visited and driven them away,
   And hast destroyed all remembrance of them.

   15 Thou hast added to the nation, O Jehovah!
   Thou hast added to the nation;
   Thou art glorified;
   Thou hast enlarged all the boundaries of the earth.

   16 O Jehovah, in trouble have they visited thee;
   They poured out a prayer, when thy chastening was upon them.

   17 As a woman with child, who draweth near to her delivery,
   Is in pain, and crieth out in her pains;
   So have we been before thy face, O Jehovah.

   18 We have been in labour,
   We have had pain,
   As if we had brought forth wind;
   Salvation hath not been wrought for the earth,
   And the inhabitants of the world have not fallen.

   19 Thy dead men shall live;
   My dead body, they shall arise;
   Awake and sing, ye inhabitants of the dust;
   For thy dew is the dew of herbs;
   And the earth shall cast out the dead. [387]

   20 Come, O my people;
   Enter thou into thy chambers;
   Shut the door behind thee;
   Hide thyself a little for a moment,
   Till the indignation pass over.

   21 For, behold, Jehovah cometh out of his place,
   To visit the iniquity of the inhabitant of the earth against him;
   And the earth shall disclose her blood,
   And shall no longer cover her slain.

   CHAPTER 27

   1 In that day will Jehovah visit
   With his hard, and great, and strong sword,
   On leviathan the piercing serpent,
   And on leviathan the crooked serpent;
   And he will slay the dragon that is in the sea.

   2 In that day sing ye to the vineyard of redness.

   3 I Jehovah keep it;
   Every moment will I water it;
   That (the enemy) may not visit it,
   I will keep it night and day.

   4 Fury doth not dwell in me.
   Who shall engage me in battle with the brier and thorn? [388]
   I will pass through it in a hostile manner,
   I will utterly burn it up.

   5 Will she take hold of my strength,
   That she may make peace with me?
   Yea, that she may make peace with me?

   6 Afterwards shall Jacob put forth roots;
   Israel shall bud and blossom;
   And the face of the world shall be filled with fruit.

   7 Hath he smitten him according to the stroke of him that smote him?
   Hath he been slain according to the slaughter of them that slew him?

   8 In measure, in her shooting forth,
   Thou wilt contend with her;
   Even though he blow with his violent wind
   In the day of the east wind.

   9 Therefore in this manner shall the iniquity of Jacob be expiated;
   And this is all the fruit,
   The taking away of his sin;
   When he shall make all the stones of the altar
   As lime-stones broken in pieces,
   That groves and images may not rise again.

   10 Yet the fortified city shall be desolate;
   The inhabited place shall be deserted,
   And forsaken like a wilderness.
   There the calf shall feed,
   And there shall lie down,
   And shall browse on its tops.

   11 When its harvest shall wither, they shall break [389] it;
   Women coming shall burn it;
   For it is a people that doth not understand;
   Therefore their Maker will not have compassion on them,
   And he who formed them will not be gracious to them.

   12 Yet in that day it shall come to pass
   That Jehovah will thrash
   From the channel of the river
   To the river of Egypt;
   And ye shall be gathered one by one,
   O children of Israel.

   13 It shall also come to pass in that day
   That the great trumpet shall be blown;
   And they shall come who were perishing in the land of Assyria,
   And who had been scattered in the land of Egypt;
   And they shall worship Jehovah
   In the holy mountain, in Jerusalem.

   CHAPTER 28

   1 Wo to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim;
   For the splendour of his glory shall be a fading flower,
   Which is on the head of the valley of the fat ones,
   Of them that are overcome by wine.

   2 Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one;
   As a deluge of hail,
   A desolating whirlwind;
   As the violence of mighty waters overflowing,
   Casting down to the earth with the hand.

   3 The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim
   Shall be trodden under feet.

   4 And the splendour of his glory shall be a fading flower,
   Which is on the head of the valley of the fat ones;
   Like the premature fig before the summer,
   Which, while he looketh at it,
   While it is yet in his hand,
   He that seeth it devoureth.

   5 In that day will Jehovah of hosts
   Become a crown of glory
   And a diadem of excellence
   To the remnant of his people,

   6 And a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth on the judgment-seat,
   And strength to them that drive back the battle to the gate.

   7 But they also have erred through wine;
   Through strong drink they have gone astray.
   The priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink;
   They have been swallowed up by wine;
   They have gone astray through strong drink;
   They have erred in vision,
   They have stumbled in judgment.

   8 For all tables are full of nauseous vomiting,
   So that no place is unoccupied.

   9 Whom shall he teach knowledge?
   And whom shall he make to understand doctrine?
   Them that are weaned from the milk?
   Them that are withdrawn from the breasts?

   10 For precept must be on precept, precept on precept;
   Instruction on instruction, instruction on instruction;
   Here a little, there a little.

   11 For with stammering lips will he speak to this people,
   And with a foreign tongue.

   12 For he said to them, This is the rest;
   Cause the weary to rest;
   And this is the refreshing;
   And they refused to hear.

   13 The word of Jehovah shall therefore be to them
   Rule upon rule, rule upon rule;
   Instruction upon instruction, instruction upon instruction;
   Here a little, there a little;
   Therefore they shall go, and shall fall backward,
   Shall be broken, and snared, and taken.

   14 Therefore hear the word of Jehovah, ye scornful men,
   Who govern this people, which is in Jerusalem.

   15 Because ye have said,
   We have struck a league with death,
   And with hell have we made a compact;
   When the overflowing scourge shall pass through,
   It shall not come to us;
   For we have made falsehood our refuge,
   And under vanity have we hidden ourselves.

   16 Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah:
   Behold, I will lay in Zion a stone, a stone of trial,
   A precious corner-stone, a sure foundation.
   He that believeth shall not make haste.

   17 And I will lay judgment to the line,
   And righteousness to the measure. [390]
   The hail shall sweep away the reliance of falsehood,
   And the waters shall overflow the hiding-place.

   18 And your compact with death shall be disannulled;
   Your agreement with hell shall not stand;
   When the overflowing scourge shall pass through,
   Then shall ye become a treading down to it.

   19 From the time that it shall pass,
   It shall seize you every morning,
   And shall pass every day by day and by night;
   And it shall be that terror [391] alone
   Shall cause them to understand the report.

   20 For the bed is short, so that it is not enough;
   The covering shall be narrow for wrapping,

   21 For as in Mount Perazim will Jehovah stand up,
   And as in the valley of Gibeon will he be angry; [392]
   To do his work, his strange work;
   To perform his act, his strange act.

   22 Now therefore be ye not mockers,
   Lest your chains be more firmly fastened;
   For I have heard from the Lord Jehovah of hosts a consumption,
   And a completion on the whole earth.

   23 Listen ye, and hear my voice;
   Hearken, and hear my speech.

   24 Doth the ploughman plough every day, that he may sow?
   Doth he open and break the clods of his field?

   25 When he hath leveled its surface,
   Will he not then scatter fitches, and sow cummin,
   And allot wheat in measure, and barley measured,
   And spelt in its order?

   26 His God instructeth him,
   And teacheth him what is right.

   27 Certainly vetches shall not be thrashed with a toothed instrument,
   Nor shall the wheel of a cart be turned round on the cummin;
   For vetches are beaten with a staff,
   And cummin with a rod.

   28 Though wheat be bruised,
   He doth not bruise it continually,
   Nor always cause the wheel of his cart to grind it,
   Lest he crush it with its teeth.

   29 This also hath proceeded from Jehovah of hosts,
   Who is wonderful in counsel,
   And majestic in procedure.

   1 Alas! Ariel, Ariel,
   The city which David inhabited,
   Add ye year to year,
   That the lambs may be slain.

   2 Yet I will bring Ariel into distress,
   And there shall be grief and sorrow,
   And it shall be to me as Ariel.

   3 And I will encamp against thee round about,
   And will attack thee with a military force,
   And will erect ramparts against thee.

   4 Then shalt thou be brought low,
   Thou shalt speak out of the earth,
   And thy speech shall come out of the dust,
   And thy voice shall be like that of a sorcerer out of the earth,
   And thy speech shall mutter out of the dust.

   5 And the sound of thy foreigners shall be as the small dust,
   And the multitude of thy mighty men as the passing chaff,
   And it shall be in a moment suddenly.

   6 Thou shalt be visited by Jehovah of hosts
   With thunder, and earthquake, and great noise,
   With whirlwind and tempest,
   And with the flame of devouring fire.

   7 And as a dream of a vision of the night shall be
   The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,
   Of every one that fighteth,
   And that raiseth fortifications against her,
   And that distresseth her.

   8 It shall therefore be
   As when a hungry man dreameth, and behold! he eateth,
   But when he awaketh, his soul is empty;
   And as when a thirsty man dreameth, And behold! He drinketh,
   But when he awaketh, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite;
   So shall be the multitude of all the nations
   That fight against Mount Zion.

   9 Tarry and wonder;
   They are blinded and they blind;
   They are drunken, but not with wine;
   They stagger, and not with strong drink.

   10 For Jehovah hath overpowered you with the spirit of slumber,
   And hath closed your eyes;
   Your prophets And principal seers
   He hath struck with darkness.

   11 Therefore every vision hath become to you
   As the words of a sealed book;
   Which if they deliver to one who knoweth letters,
   And say, Read in it, I pray,
   Then shall he say, I cannot,
   For it is sealed:

   12 And if the book be delivered to one who hath not learned letters,
   And it be said, Read in it, I pray,
   Then shall he say, I know not letters.

   13 Therefore the Lord saith:
   Because this people draw near to me with their mouth,
   And honour me with their lips,
   And have removed their heart far from me,
   And their fear toward me hath been taught by the commandment of men;

   14 Therefore, behold! I add to do
   A wonderful work among this people,
   A miracle and a prodigy;
   For the wisdom of their wise men shall perish,
   And the prudence of their prudent men shall vanish away.

   15 Wo to them that conceal themselves from Jehovah,
   That they may hide counsel;
   For their works are in the dark, and they say,
   Who seeth us? and, Who knoweth us?

   16 Is your turning reckoned like potters clay?
   Doth a work say of its author, He did not make me?
   And doth a thing framed say of its framer, He did not understand?

   17 Is it not yet a little, a little,
   And Lebanon shall be changed into Carmel,
   And Carmel shall be reckoned a forest?

   18 And in that day shall the deaf hear
   The words of the book,
   And the eyes of the blind shall see
   Out of obscurity and out of darkness.

   19 Then shall the humble again take joy in Jehovah,
   And the poor of men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

   20 For the violent man is brought to nought,
   The mocker is despised;
   And they who hastened early to iniquity are ruined.

   21 Who make a man to offend in word,
   Who have laid snares for him that reproveth in the gate,
   And have turned aside the righteous man for nothing.

   22 Therefore Jehovah, who redeemed Abraham,
   Speaketh thus to the house of Jacob:
   Jacob shall not now be confounded,
   Nor shall his face now become pale.

   23 For when he shall see in the midst of him
   His children, the work of my hands,
   They shall sanctify my name,
   They shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob,
   They shall fear the God of Israel.

   24 Then they that erred in spirit shall learn understanding,
   And the murmurers shall learn doctrine.

   CHAPTER 30

   1 Wo to the rebellious [393] children, saith Jehovah,
   That they may take counsel, and not from me;
   That they may cover a secret, [394] and not from my Spirit;
   That they may add sin to sin.

   2 Who set out that they may go down into Egypt,
   And have not inquired at my mouth;
   Strengthening themselves with the strength of Pharaoh,
   And trusting in the shadow of Egypt.

   3 But the strength of Pharaoh
   Shall become to you shame;
   And reliance on the shadow of Egypt
   Shall become disgrace.

   4 For his princes were in Zoan,
   And his ambassadors came to Hanes.

   5 All shall be ashamed
   Of a people that will not profit them,
   And will not become a help,
   And will not yield advantage,
   But will become shame,
   And even disgrace.

   6 The burden of the beasts of the south.
   In the land of trouble and anguish,
   The lion and the stronger lion,
   The viper and the flying serpent;
   While they shall carry their riches
   On the shoulders of young asses,
   And on the bunches of camels,
   To a people that will not profit them.

   7 Surely the Egyptians are vanity,
   And shall help in vain.
   Therefore have I cried to her,
   Their strength is to sit still.

   8 Now go, and write this vision on a tablet before them,
   And engrave it in a book,
   That it may be till the last day,
   For ever and ever.

   9 For this is a rebellious people,
   Lying children,
   Children who refuse to hear the law of Jehovah.

   10 Who say to the seers, Do not see,
   And to the foreseers, Do not foresee to us right things;
   Speak ye to us flatteries,
   See ye errors.

   11 Go out of the way;
   Turn aside from the path;
   Cause the Holy One of Israel
   To depart from our presence.

   12 Therefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel:
   Because ye have disdained this word,
   And have trusted in violence and wickedness,
   And have rested on it;

   13 Therefore shall your iniquity be to you
   Like a breach falling,
   Like the bulging out in a lofty wall,
   The fall of which comes suddenly and unexpectedly.

   14 And the breaking of it shall be
   As the breaking of a potter's vessel,
   Which is broken without mercy;
   And in its breaking there is not found a sherd
   To carry fire from the hearth,
   Or to draw water from a well.

   15 For thus saith the Lord Jehovah,
   The Holy One of Israel:
   In rest and quietness shall you be safe;
   In peace and confidence shall be your strength;
   But ye would not.

   16 And ye said, No, but we will flee on horses;
   Therefore shall ye flee;
   We will ride on the swift;
   Therefore they that shall pursue you shall be more swift.

   17 A thousand as one from the face of the rebuke of one,
   From the face of the rebuke of five shall ye flee,
   Until ye shall be left
   As the mast of a ship on the top of a mountain,
   And as a banner on a hill.

   18 Therefore will Jehovah wait for you,
   That he may have compassion on you;
   And therefore will he be exalted,
   That he may have compassion on you;
   For Jehovah is a God of judgment:
   Blessed are all they that wait for him.

   19 Surely the people in Zion shall dwell in Jerusalem:
   Weeping thou shalt not weep;
   With compassion will he have compassion on thee;
   At the voice of thy cry, as soon as he shall hear it,
   He will answer thee.

   20 When the Lord shall have given to you
   Bread of anguish
   And water of affliction,
   Thy rain shall not be withheld,
   And thine eyes shall see thy rain.

   21 Then shall thine ears hear a word behind thee,
   Saying, This is the way;
   Walk ye in it;
   Whether ye go to the right,
   Or go to the left.

   22 Then shall ye profane
   The covering of the graven images of thy silver,
   And the covering of thy molten gold;
   And thou shalt put it away from thee as a menstruous cloth,
   And shalt say to it, Depart. [395]

   23 Then will he give rain to thy seed,
   When thou shalt have sowed the ground,
   And bread of the produce of the earth;
   And it shall be plentiful and fat;
   And in that day thy cattle
   Shall feed in large pastures.

   24 Thine oxen also,
   And the young asses that labour the ground,
   Shall eat clean provender,
   Which shall be winnowed with the shovel
   And with the sieve.

   25 And it shall come to pass,
   That on every high mountain,
   And on every lofty hill,
   Shall be streams, streams of waters,
   In the day of the great slaughter
   When the towers shall have fallen.

   26 And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun,
   And the light of the sun shall be sevenfold,
   As the light of seven days,
   In the day when Jehovah
   Shall have bound up the breach of his people,
   And shall have healed the stroke of their wound.

   27 Behold! the name of Jehovah cometh
   From a distant place:
   His face burneth,
   And the burden is heavy;
   His lips are full of indignation,
   And his tongue as a devouring fire.

   28 And his breath, as an overflowing torrent,
   Shall divide even to the neck;
   To sift the nations with a useless sieve;
   And on the cheeks of the peoples
   There shall be a bridle causing to err.

   29 You shall have a song, as in the night
   When a festival is kept,
   And gladness of heart,
   As of him that moveth to a pipe,
   That he may come to the mountain of Jehovah,
   To the Mighty One of Israel.

   30 And Jehovah shall cause to be heard the power of his voice,
   And shall cause to be seen the descent of his arm,
   With rage of countenance,
   And with the flame of devouring fire,
   With scattering, with flood, and with hailstones.

   31 Verily by the voice of Jehovah shall the Assyrian be crushed,
   Who smote with a rod.

   32 And in every passage shall be the fastened staff,
   Which Jehovah shall lay upon him
   With tabrets and harps,
   And with battles of lifting up
   Shall he fight against her.

   33 For Tophet is ordained since yesterday;
   Yea, for the king it is prepared:
   He hath made it deep and large;
   The pile of it is fire, and much wood;
   The breath of Jehovah, like a torrent of brimstone,
   Doth kindle it.

   CHAPTER 31

   1 Wo to them that go down into Egypt for help,
   And who rely on horses,
   And who trust to chariots, because they are numerous,
   And to horses, because they are very strong,
   And have not looked to the Holy One of Israel,
   Nor have sought Jehovah.

   2 Yet he also is wise:
   Therefore he will bring evil,
   And will not make void his words;
   He will rise up against the house of the evil-doers,
   And against the aid of the workers of vanity.

   3 And verily the Egyptian is a man, and not God;
   And his horses are flesh, and not spirit.
   Therefore, as soon as Jehovah shall stretch out his arm,
   The helper shall fall,
   And he who is helped shall fall down,
   And all shall fail together.

   4 For thus hath Jehovah said to me:
   As the lion roareth,
   And the young lion for his prey,
   Against whom, if a multitude of shepherds be gathered together,
   He shall not be alarmed by their cry,
   And shall not humble himself on account of their noise;
   Thus will Jehovah of hosts come down
   To fight for Mount Zion,
   And for its hill.

   5 As birds which fly,
   So will Jehovah of hosts defend Jerusalem;
   Defending, he will deliver it,
   And passing over, he will preserve it.

   6 Return ye,
   As ye have made a deep revolt,
   O children of Israel!

   7 For in that day shall a man cast away
   The idols of his silver,
   And the idols of his gold,
   Which your hands have made for you, a sin.

   8 Then shall the Assyrian fall by the sword, not of a mighty man;
   And the sword, not of a man, shall devour him;
   And by flight shall he seek safety from the face of the sword,
   And his young men shall melt away.

   9 He shall pass to his stronghold through fear,
   And his princes shall tremble at the banner, saith Jehovah,
   Who hath a fire [396] in Zion,
   And who hath a furnace in Jerusalem.

   CHAPTER 32

   1 Behold! a king shall reign in righteousness,
   And princes shall rule in judgment.

   2 And that man shall be
   As a hiding-place from the wind,
   As a covert from the rain,
   As streams of waters on dry ground,
   As the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.

   3 Then the eyes of them that see shall not be closed up,
   And the ears of them that hear shall hearken.

   4 And the heart of fools shall be eagerly directed to knowledge,
   And the tongue of stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.

   5 No longer shall the base man be called liberal,
   Nor shall the parsimonious man be called bountiful.

   6 For the vile person will speak vileness,
   And his heart will contrive iniquity,
   To commit wickedness,
   That he may utter mockery against Jehovah,
   That he may make empty the hungry soul,
   And that he may withhold drink from him that is thirsty.

   7 The instruments of the covetous man are evil; [397]
   He contriveth wickednesses,
   That he may deceive the simple by lying words,
   And that he may speak against the poor man in judgment.

   8 But the liberal man shall devise liberal things,
   And in acting liberally he shall make progress.

   9 Ye women at ease, arise;
   Hear my voice, ye careless daughters;
   Hearken to my speech.

   10 Days above a year shall ye tremble, ye careless women;
   For the vintage shall fail,
   And the gathering shall not come.

   11 Tremble, ye women that are at ease;
   Be troubled, ye careless women;
   Strip you, make you bare, gird your limbs.

   12 Mourning over the udders,
   Over the pleasant fields,
   Over the fruitful vine.

   13 There shall come up the thorn and brier
   On the land of my people,
   Even on all the houses of gladness in the city of rejoicing.

   14 For the palace shall be forsaken;
   The noise of the city shall be left;
   The tower and the fortress
   Shall be reduced to dens for ever,
   Where wild asses may delight themselves,
   And where flocks may feed.

   15 Till the Spirit be poured out upon you from on high,
   And the wilderness become a cultivated field,
   And the cultivated field be reckoned like a forest.

   16 And judgment shall dwell in the wilderness,
   And justice shall have its abode in the cultivated field.

   17 And the work of righteousness shall be peace;
   The effect of righteousness shall be
   Safety and quietness for ever.

   18 And my people shall dwell in a tabernacle of peace,
   And in safe dwellings,
   And in quiet resting-places.

   19 And in coming down the hail shall turn aside on the forest,
   And the city shall be situated in a low place.

   20 Blessed are ye who sow on all waters,
   Who send forth the feet of the ox and of the ass.
