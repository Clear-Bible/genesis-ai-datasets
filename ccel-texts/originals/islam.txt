                              Dr. Jan H. Boer [1]


   It is the year 2010. We are in the middle of a period in which Islam
   forms the central focus for much of the world. It is possible that we
   stand at the door of an entirely new era of world history in which
   Islam will be much more dominant than it has in the immediate past
   centuries. Only time will tell.

   For the West, this is not the first time Islam has claimed so much
   attention. There were the Crusades. There was the Andelusian Muslim
   civilization from AD 711 AD till 1492, at one time covering almost the
   entire Iberian peninsula. This meant the Western heartland was
   confronted with the Muslim challenge at its very doorstep for almost
   eight centuries, a force they could not afford to ignore and which
   became an important stimulant for Western cultural development. But
   then the challenge receded into the distance. Kuyper's book on Muslim
   civilizations around the Mediterranean was written during another
   transition period, namely the time of the collapse of the Turkish
   Caliphate or Sultanate in 1923.

   As Kuyper's Introduction shows, this work became very popular in its
   country of origin, The Netherlands. This material is translated from a
   copious work of two massive volumes. They were expensive in a time of
   limited wealth. Kuyper was delighted that, in spite of general poverty
   and the limitations of a small Dutch-language market, the first 5000
   copies sold immediately and within two months two more prints appeared.
   What especially enthralled him was that a young lady almost immediately
   prepared a Braille version of this entire two-volume set! Clearly this
   was a subject of major interest to the Dutch populace. A popular Dutch
   writer, J. W. Schulte Nordholt, wrote almost a century later, "We can
   learn much from this book. Though the main theme of this work is not
   altogether clear to me, it contains much interesting random data. A
   traveler around the Mediterranean today will still find much enjoyment
   from reading these century-old Kuyper books and is sure to appreciate
   them." [2]

   Of course, there may have been additional reasons for the popularity of
   this work. Kuyper himself was a Dutch icon. Since the 1870s he had been
   at the centre of a battle for Christian liberation of the Dutch
   Calvinist masses from the tyranny of a state-church alliance that was
   dominated by modernist liberalism, today described as secularism. The
   battle was waged organizationally, spiritually, politically and in
   print at every major cultural front in the country. The end product was
   a host of Christian organizations, including a new denomination, and a
   new sense of power among the people he championed. They took over the
   government with Kuyper and, later, succeeding leaders of the movement
   serving off and on as Prime Ministers till this day. Until well into
   2010, the Dutch Prime Minister, J. P. Balkenende, described himself as
   a Kuyperian. [3] Due to the triple influence of secularism, Barthian
   theology and stultifying traditionalism that requires new oxygen for
   rejuvenation, the resulting social structures based on religion and
   worldview are currently lamented by some Dutch citizens as
   "verzuiling." However, the system is lauded in other quarters,
   including and especially foreigners, as the most effective guarantee
   for the freedom of all religions and worldviews. [4]

   While engaged in this whirlpool of re-organizing society, Kuyper also
   wrote an entire library that includes massive tomes of heavy academic
   and philosophic treatises as well as many volumes of meditations marked
   by a wholistic piety--in distinction from pietism, which is not
   wholistic! [5] -- and innumerable articles in the newspapers he himself
   established, one of which, Trouw, still exists as a daily and is now
   part of an international publishing conglomerate. This entire body of
   Kuyperiana was very popular in his day. In the course of these
   writings, Kuyper led his people in the development of a new worldview
   that was orthodox but hardly "conservative" as that term is popularly
   used today, and significantly different from existing Christian
   traditions and philosophies, even though borrowing heavily from them.
   It can be said that he re-arranged or re-combined existing
   philosophical and theological concepts into a dynamic new Christian
   worldview that features a heavy emphasis on this world and society
   without losing sight of the spiritual and eternal sides of creation.

   I have introduced elements of this new school of thought in Volumes 1,
   5 and 8 of my series Studies in Christian-Muslim Relations as well as
   some other publications. [6] It goes by various names, such as
   Neo-Calvinism, Kuyperianism, Neo-Kuyperian even, and Reformational.
   Succeeding generations strove to produce a more or less full-fledged
   Christian philosophical system that is matched among modern orthodox
   Christians only by Roman Catholics. [7] It is widely sought after by
   Christians throughout the world today who are seeking to develop a
   Christian worldview that can responsibly counter secularism and Islam.
   Unfortunately, they are hampered by language problems, since many of
   the core publications exist only in Dutch, a language not widely
   understood. Fortunately, the movement is spawning an increasing number
   of English publications, to which this translation is a small
   contribution. I have only recently learned about the exciting and
   ambitious hopes of the Kuyper Center at Princeton Theological Seminary
   to translate all or most Kuyperiana into English.

   I am offering this English translation of Kuyper's discussion on Islam
   not because he was an expert on the subject nor because I agree with
   all his opinions, allegations or predictions. In fact, I don't. My
   reason is that it is interesting for his 21^st-century heirs to learn
   how Kuyper, the pioneer of an emerging international school of
   philosophy and social action, interpreted the Islamic movement of a
   century ago, the same movement that today is once again at the centre
   of the world's attention. How did this pioneer of wholistic
   Christianity and assailant of an intolerant secularism a century ago
   interpret Islamic wholism and its resistance to secularism? I leave
   potential implications for today for you to ponder.

   Kuyper was a reformer or, in more contemporary language, a social
   transformer, a radical transformer in the sense that he went to the
   root of things he tackled, to their radix. He was not a radical in the
   popular modern sense in that he sought to overthrow existing structures
   and replace them with others that had no basis in history, as is the
   tendency of liberal secularism. He constantly sought to base his claims
   and efforts on both the Bible, the deep historical roots of his own
   country, as well as on various strands of existing philosophies. But,
   prophetic as he was, he could hardly be expected to transform an entire
   society in one lifetime. He remained a child of his time and, while
   tackling important cultural sectors, left others in their traditional
   state, often embracing the popular notions of his day that may be
   rejected today. He is faulted for that and, sometimes, deeply resented
   and criticized, especially by some Christians involved in the feminist
   movement. Sometimes he is said to have unwittingly prepared the
   foundations of South African apartheid. However, I have listened to a
   Black South African [8] speaking at a Kuyper centennial celebration at
   Princeton Theological Seminary in 1998, who stated that he stood before
   this international forum of scholars precisely because he was a product
   of the Kuyperian liberation movement. In short, no man, woman or even
   movement can do it all in one generation. It is sufficient that
   descendants continue the transformation over succeeding generations in
   areas not touched by "Father Abraham." He did lay the foundations for
   expanding the entire Christian horizon, worldview and range of social
   action, even if he did not apply it as fully as some demand today, a
   century later. Will expecting more of one man or movement be fair or
   reasonable? Kuyper had to leave some things for us to do!

   Kuyper leaves us with an intriguing question. Interwoven throughout the
   article is the reality of Western imperialism that then as now rattles
   the Muslim world as well as myself. Being a politician of note, even
   Prime Minister of his country, as well as a pioneering liberation
   theologian of orthodox vintage, one would think that Kuyper might have
   had some sympathy for the Muslim community's political plight and
   indicate at least some misgivings about Western aggression. One detects
   none of that in this publication, even though he was aware of Muslims'
   chaving under this yoke.

   My comment, I hasten to say, is not mere cheap hindsight. The
   ecumenical movement of the day was acutely aware of the un-Christian
   behaviour of the West vis a vis its colonies and did not hide its
   dismay. [9] Similarly, Kuyper was painfully aware of the parallel
   problems caused by laissez faire capitalism in his home country and
   railed against them in radical terms: "The law of the animal world, dog
   eat dog, became the basic law for every social relationship." [10] And,
   yes, he did also recognize similar dynamics in colonialism and had a
   certain ambivalence towards it. [11] It does not appear that he ever
   overcame this ambivalence. However, I would argue that if the main
   contours of Kuyper's predilection as a liberation theologian/politician
   had been allowed to work themselves out, Kuyper would have ended up on
   the side of Johannes Verkuyl, a Kuyperian missionary of a later
   generation. He was imprisoned by the Dutch for siding with the
   Indonesians in their struggle for independence. It was another point on
   which Kuyper and most of his successors did not achieve clarity. [12]


   An explanatory note: There are many references throughout the article
   to events, persons and place names that are not immediately clear to
   most 21^st-century readers. I considered inserting explanatory
   footnotes. Then I realized that almost all of them can be found on the
   internet and have only to be "googled." So, for those who want all
   those details, I refer you to the internet. I could not find any
   information about some names or events on the internet, neither about
   their meaning nor their English spelling. Those I marked with a star
   (*). For those who are interested only in the general perspective
   Kuyper offers, the article will suffice for a starter as it stands.
   [13]

   A cautionary note: Be it understood that translating it all does not
   translate into agreeing with it all.

   Kuyper and his allies made grateful use of existing Western philosophy,
   but they fused these various philosophical concepts into a unique
   combination.

   [12] This ambivalence continued to characterize Kuyper's political
   party for decades and kept it from developing the radical stance to
   which the Kuyperian perspective really should drive his heirs. This
   ambivalence among Kuyperians eventually drove the American Kuyperian
   philosopher Nicholas Wolterstorff, retired Yale professor, to near
   despair. He cried it out about his church, the Christian Reformed
   Church in North America (CRC), being so proud of its Kuyperian heritage
   but having become so "quiescently--sometimes even
   oppressively--conservative." (N. Wolterstorff, 1983, p. ix. J. Boer,
   1992, pp. 187-188.) Why did that happen? How could this happen? I
   believe it has to do with the constituency climbing the socio-economic
   ladder from working class and low middle to middle, high middle and
   managerial class. Marx was correct about our worldviews and religions
   tending to follow changes in our economic conditions more than
   following the authority of our Holy Book, not infrequently regardless
   of that Holy Book. We may not consciously turn away from the Book, but
   our interpretation gradually and unnoticeably changes to conform to the
   new situation. The CRC constituency that spawned the Christian Labour
   Association in the USA during the 1930s, rejected all overtures made by
   that body during the 1990s. During the transition of its constituency
   from a largely labour community to one of owners and managers, it also
   changed from pro-union (Christian) to anti-union, including Christian,
   while Well, that's a whole story in itself--and a lucid example of
   Marx's thesis.

   Introduction


   By Abraham Kuyper



   I can only be grateful for the reception this book has enjoyed. It is
   encouraging that the first print of 5,000 copies of a work of this
   format--[remember: the whole was a voluminous two-tome
   job--translator]--and that was available only at a rather steep price,
   enjoyed two reprints within two months! Even more so, given the
   restrictions of the small Dutch-language market. But I derived the
   greatest satisfaction from the young lady who had such love for the
   blind that she had the patience to promptly produce a Braille edition
   of this work! It forms a gigantic tome that can be seen at the Library
   for the Blind in The Hague.

   Originally I was at a loss as to how to explain such humbling interest
   in this project. It did not pretend to be scholarly. Neither could it
   be regarded as a great literary work or a captivating travel journal.
   Market research later revealed that readers were attracted by the great
   amount of highly compact information about a region in which there is
   wide-spread interest but little knowledge. To be sure, during the 1890s
   a couple of major books on the region were published in French (1891)
   and German (1895), but the French one became too voluminous with its
   nine heavy tomes, while the German one was simply too broad in compass
   without showing the interwoven nature of developments around the
   Mediterranean. Thus a great need was felt for a work in compact format
   that would provide information about the peoples around that sea. [14]
   Encouraged by the initial popularity of this work, I thus decided to
   proceed with a condensed description of some of the less familiar
   Mediterranean countries not covered so far. I included Spain and
   Portugal mainly because of the residue of Muslim civilization and
   culture that still marks these countries.

   History does not stand still. In several of the countries I visited,
   significant changes were underway. I took careful note of these changes
   in the awareness that a book that is in progress for two years cannot
   possibly be up to date in its first chapters. This applies especially
   to Turkey with the revolution that took place there and that totally
   changed the issues surrounding the Balkan question. Allow me therefore
   briefly to draw your attention to this revolution.

   Although Abdul Hamid remained Sultan, one must regard the change in
   government there as nothing less than a wholesale revolution. A groups
   known as "The Young Turks" had quietly blanketed the country with a
   network of Committees or cells that were obviously copied from the
   French Revolution. These Committees constitute the government, not only
   in Constantinople but also in the more remote villages. Government
   officials are totally dependent on these Committees. Even the Sultan
   has no choice but to go by their policies. They depose ministers and
   other officials at will. Even the judiciary is subject to their
   policies. This arrangement had since long been planned by a central
   committee in Paris. Actually it was Sultan Abdul Hamid with his
   carelessness and reckless expenditures who empowered them to suddenly
   carry out their plot without bloodshed.

   They availed themselves of the same instrument that had upheld the
   regime of the Sultan, namely the army. The army had been neglected, not
   in terms of weaponry or training, but in salaries and promotions. Even
   among the troops that the Sultan had sent to Yemen to squelch a
   rebellion there, repeated mutiny took place. Government and the corrupt
   civil service slurped up all the available funds. Hence, the troops
   were not paid and promotions were intentionally delayed to avoid paying
   higher salaries. Dissatisfaction was rife and that was the weapon the
   Young Turks used to draw army officers to their side. The rank and file
   soldiers followed suit. The confusing state of affairs in Macedonia,
   which was close enough to Constantinople, allowed them space and time
   to organize themselves properly and then, from that vantage point, to
   dare an attack on Constantinople. They did so by raising the same
   slogan that already had been used by Abdul Hamid to checkmate the
   Western powers in the region, namely restoration of the Constitution.

   The constitutional cry by itself did not raise any Muslim hackles, for
   it is in keeping with the Muslim spirit. Hence, even the Sultan
   supported the call for the retrieval of the Constitution. Islam is
   democratic by nature. It was accepted in Algeria, and long ago in
   Spanish Cordova a Muslim republic had been established. The new issue
   here was only the attempt to create a Turkish nation in which all
   inhabitants, regardless of origin or religion, would be accorded full
   rights. Christians cheered at the prospect, for it could spell the end
   of their centuries-long oppression. The neighbouring Greeks cheered,
   because they expected that the new situation would ensure their
   influence over the government. Even the Bulgarian army withdrew from
   the country, for now they would be able to achieve their national
   political aims without bloodshed. The people themselves, including some
   groups within the palace, were convinced that finally the heavy
   pressure of the Western powers upon them would come to an end. From now
   on, the Sultan could defend himself against the demands of the West by
   pointing to the refusal of Parliament. Thus, when the West hastened to
   withdraw their political representatives from Macedonia, the Turkish
   people imagined they had already won the game.

   That myth soon dissolved. Bulgaria understood that it was now possible
   and, in fact, imperative for her to take immediate action, for once the
   Turkish Parliament would have its affairs in order, all chances for
   regaining her independence from Turkey would slip through her fingers.
   Austria annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina with great speed. Crete also
   made use of the interim period to finalize her attachment to Greece.
   Thus, instead of gaining or profiting from internal developments, even
   before the Parliament was fully established, Turkey lost the greater
   part of her nominal European possessions and was left only with
   Macedonia, Albania and the Sanjak of Novi Pazar, along with the area
   immediately surrounding Constantinople, now known as Istanbul. The
   greatest disappointment was that the West began their interference
   again, interference for which Turkey itself now needed to invite them.
   The hope was that Turkey would finally become great, free and
   independent. Instead, it was greatly reduced so that it is no longer a
   threat to anyone. A war would have put a sudden end to the new regime
   of the Young Turks.

   Thus, though the restoration of the Constitution itself was a matter of
   general rejoicing, it immediately evoked bitter disappointment. That
   disappointment became more intense as soon as Parliament settled down
   to its work. Due to the power the Young Turks wielded throughout
   Turkey, they quickly succeeded in cobbling together a Parliament that
   meekly carried out their designs, but it did not take long for that
   Parliament to become the source of division. The Young Turks were real
   Occidentalists, oriented to Western culture, that wanted a
   constitutional atmosphere that was not rooted in the East, but was
   wholly to be based on the radical French model. Even in Austria that is
   united by the bond of a common religion, the possibility of different
   nationalities to live together under one constitution is visibly
   evaporating. How much more will Turkey have problems with its varied
   nationalities in addition to the division caused by its three
   religions? Currently, it is being realized in Hungary that under such
   conditions it is impossible for one nationality to place its stamp on
   the entire population for any length of time without even greater
   failure. Like the Magyars in Hungary, so do the Turks want to have
   their language and their religion declared the language and religion of
   the State. Everyone can sense ahead of time where this will lead. It is
   still an open question how the current crisis will develop, but we can
   be sure that this first crisis will be little more than prelude to a
   much more serious struggle. Those who dream that the Young Turks have
   solved the Eastern question are not familiar with Mediterranean
   cultures. The Turkish people are not a nation and never will be. [15]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [14] Given his own verbosity that resulted in multi-volume tomes, it is
   almost humorous for Kuyper to present his as compact!

   [15] For a relevant brief modern or current discussion of the "Young
   Turks" and of their long-range success compared to that of other Muslim
   nations, see Gwynne Dyer, "Turkey, Islam and the Idiotic Autocrats,'"
   Georgia Straight, September 6-13, 2007. See also my Studies in
   Christian-Muslim Relations, Volume 9--Companion CD, 2009, file &lt;
   Miscellaneous Articles/Other Countries/Asia/Turkey/2007-09-06 Turkey
   Islam Democracy &gt;. These "Young Turks" were more successful than
   Kuyper predicted. Today, their descendants are serious contenders for
   membership in the European Union. The very movement that initially
   resisted European colonization, today is applying for absorption into
   Europe! Who says history is boring or without humour? There is a
   difference, of course. Today it is in terms of so-called equal
   partnership. Today the question is whether a Muslim country that has
   not experienced the Western Enlightenment movement fits in an
   Enlightenment-Christian-Postmodern alliance.

                              The Mystery of Islam

   More than in Asia, when you move over to Africa you will be impressed
   not only by the power of Islam but by its mystery. It is in Africa,
   more than in Asia, that Islam is spreading rapidly. Mahdi after Mahdi
   has demonstrated how easily and powerfully the flames of fanaticism can
   light up. The mystical orders are making their influence felt in the
   spiritual soil from Khartoum to Rabat. Al Azhar, the university in
   Cairo, is the most prestigious and most influential of all Muslim
   schools. I do not wish to belittle the serious influence Islam still
   holds along the long route from Hayderabad in India to Bosnia on the
   Adriatic Sea, or along the long line that runs from Orenburg to
   Batavia. However, in Asia, Islam merely maintains the position she long
   ago achieved during its heyday. In contrast, in North Africa, Islam is
   visibly on the march. Even among the Negro people that fill Africa's
   interior, Islam continues to win converts.

   In the first part of this work I have sufficiently shown that I do not
   regard Asian Islam a spent force or an exhausted autumn plant. Saudi
   Arabia, India and Indonesia demonstrate the contrary. However, if you
   want to learn about the conquering force of Islam, then you must turn
   to Africa. In this "dark" continent of almost 30 million square
   kilometers, an area three times the size of Europe, there live 170
   million people who, with the exception of Ethiopia and South Africa,
   increasingly are turning away from Christianity to seek their salvation
   in Islam. Sixteen centuries ago, the entire northern coast of the
   Mediterranean and its east coast from Port Said to deep into Sudan was
   won for the Christian faith, but this has all disappeared. Islam has
   triumphed along the entire coast. And it now appears that the Crescent
   is seriously poised to conquer the interior as well.

   As it suddenly lit up the sky like a meteor in the seventh century and
   began its miraculous triumphal march from Mecca, Islam is one of the
   most difficult phenomena in world history to explain, especially
   psychologically. Till this day it has still not fully revealed its
   enigmatic nature. Oh, yes, Christianity also spread very rapidly.
   Already by its fourth century it had penetrated deep into the heart of
   Asia, had conquered the entire north coast of Africa and southern
   Europe. It practically covered the entire width and breath of the once
   mighty Roman Empire and exercised spiritual authority over this entire
   area. But what was this Christian expansion compared to the gigantic
   triumph of Islam that within a century after the Hijira, with the
   exception of the bulk of Europe, subjected the same expansive
   territories in Asia and Africa, not merely to its spiritual influence
   but simultaneously to its sword?

   This is psychologically all the more amazing when you consider that
   Christianity conquered a series of weak, primitive religions, while
   Islam burrowed its way into country after country where the higher
   religion of the Cross had blossomed with such unexpected richness.
   Islam broke through with a force to which no one offered resistance,
   drove out everything in its path and subdued it. It transformed the
   reigning spirit of the day by imposing its own. It imposed its stamp on
   the conquered peoples so thoroughly and deeply that today, fourteen
   centuries later, all these nations live out of the spirit of Islam,
   adhere to its traditions and stubbornly resist all other cultures, even
   the higher, more developed, ones. Wherever train tracks cut through
   field and farm and telegraph lines snake their way through farms and
   along modern roadways, everyone, Bedouin as well as sedentary
   populations, is marked by that ancient unchanging stamp that Muhammad,
   that mysterious son of Abdullah and Amina with his powerful
   personality, was able to impress on his followers in Mecca in the
   seventh century in both their spiritual and cultural makeup.

   What actually was this magic wand with which Muhammad won this
   unprecedented loyalty and brought about this unique turn in the history
   of the world? It cannot possibly be attributed to conscious deceit. A
   deceiver lives on basis of his lies and can produce no more than pseudo
   events that can only control restricted circles and are short-lived.
   Undoubtedly Muhammad had ecstatic visionary instincts, but such
   instincts are both quickly enflamed and equally quickly extinguished.
   Such a person is not likely to possess sustaining power through the
   centuries. A spiritual power of the first order must have dwelt in
   Muhammad that, regardless of other factors of lower rank, supplied the
   essential driving force from which his creativity emerged and that
   retains its vitality till this day. That driving force undoubtedly was
   his inspired and resilient call for Monotheism.

   Mohammad had a weak moment once in Mecca. Under pressure of a threat to
   his life, he recited a verse still found in the Qur'an, Sura
   53:19-21--"Have you seen Lata and Uzza, and another, the third
   (goddess), Manat? What! For you the male sex, and for Him, the female?"
   [16] This was weakness. Uzza and Manat were well-known idols. Since
   then he has with relentless severity preached Allah, the god of the
   ancient Hanifites, as the only true God and held up this as Allah, the
   All Compassionate and All Merciful, as the exclusive object of worship
   for his adherents.

   Religion in general stirs us in the deepest of our being; it is more
   powerful than any other factor in our personal lives as well as in the
   history of nations. Among religions, it is Monotheism that does this
   most powerfully, because it reduces all things to their single origin,
   propels them along a single consistent line and guides all things
   towards their destiny or end where it unites them in one elevated
   focus. The courage that welled up from all this to break with all forms
   of Polytheism and everything associated with it, reached so deeply into
   the existing regime, that the glow it emitted consumed nearly all
   resistance and called up a totally new life motif or worldview. The
   courage of such a heroic spirit evokes enthusiasm, and elevated
   enthusiasm transports the masses, propels them along and raises them to
   heights and powers far above their normal levels.

   The spiritual centre of Muhammad was embedded in both his deep
   conviction of the evil of Polytheism and in his bold confession of
   Monotheism. However, his purely spiritual power would never have
   guaranteed him his triumph if the effects of his principle had not
   opened the way for the ongoing penetration of his spiritual message.
   This penetration was due not so much to clever manipulation as to the
   expression of his personality in relation to both his own local and
   international environments at the time. Muhammad did not develop his
   confession next to or outside of daily life. His religion was not a
   mystery suitable only for the inner chamber. Rather, he was so deeply
   and ideologically convinced of the all-encompassing rule of Allah's
   omnipotence, that he spread his confession of Allah as a net over the
   full range of human culture, and demanded its dominance over the
   personal and family as well as economic and political life. Religion as
   a private affair was unthinkable for him. [17] Monotheism did not only
   exclude all rival gods but Allah, but just as much every other
   commanding or deciding power whether in the human will, in established
   cultural customs or in the power of the State. Allah alone rules and
   controls everything. The universe is like a gigantic clock designed by
   Allah, artfully assembled by Him, wound up by Him, and operating
   according to His fixed rules. Allah's will and law alone apply and
   decide the direction of all of life and of all existence. This is not
   only currently the case, but has been so in the past and will be so in
   the farthest reaches of the future.

   That is the reason Muhammad connected to earlier revelations of
   Monotheism. He did not consider his a new religion. Neither was it a
   religion that syncretistically was cobbled together by mixing existing
   religions. Allah had always reigned, had all the while revealed His
   will and had from the beginning counted in history. It is just that
   mankind was not capable of comprehending the full mystery of Allah's
   rule all at once. Hence Allah revealed Himself gradually,
   progressively, step by step. The prophets of all the ages were the
   vehicles for these revelations. They numbered in the thousands, but
   most of them were of minor significance. Some were mere sparks that
   flamed up quickly but extinguished just as quickly. A few among them
   became leading vehicles in this development of the service of Allah.
   Adam was the first in that series. The series includes Noah and Shem.
   After them, especially Abraham, Moses and Jesus Christ. All of these
   not only struggle zealously for Monotheism and proclaimed the majesty
   of Allah, but in their successive appearances they formed an unbroken
   chain, a continuous progressive revelation from Allah. Jesus was the
   last among them before Muhammad, and the highest. However, even Jesus
   Christ was merely one of the many prophets, the latest in order and the
   highest, but no higher than Moses and other predecessors in rank and
   kind. That is why even in Jesus, divine revelation had not yet come to
   a close. Did the Gospels themselves not predict that after Jesus there
   would be another Comforter? That final closure to revelation came in
   the person of Muhammad. He completed what was begun with Adam, Abraham,
   Moses and Jesus. Muhammad received the closing revelation. At the
   eschaton, that is, the end of all things, at the closure of world
   history, there will be more appearances, but these will no longer
   belong to history, for that history will also have come to its close.
   From now until that ending, that is, during this present dispensation,
   there will not come any further, higher or more complete revelation
   after Muhammad. What began with Adam or, if you prefer, with Abraham,
   is one single unified process that found its finale in Muhammad. That
   is why all faith comes down to two articles: first, the confession that
   Allah controls all things; second, that Muhammad represents His full
   and closing revelation.

   But now, according to Muhammad, that revelation is complete. That is to
   say, that revelation, being the final revelation of God's will, must
   have priority over the law and rule over all other things. Here is
   where the Qur'an came in and then, next to it, a variety of sources of
   orthodoxy. There are the Hadith [the Traditions or record of individual
   actions and sayings by the Prophet as reported by his Companions], the
   Sunnah [the sacred collection of the Hadiths, the second highest
   Islamic authority next to the Qur'an] and the Ijima as the vox populi
   [the voice of the people] comprising the entire body of learned Islamic
   scholars and their output. The last is associated with the Ijtihad, a
   controversial method of logical deduction that may lead to innovation
   within Islam. [18] Nothing could be left to human initiative.
   Everything had to be arranged according to higher ordinances. Allah had
   to govern the life of his true worshippers in all its breadth and
   depth. Here you have the origin of the rigorous Nomism or legalism that
   has penetrated all of Islam as a yeast. Later, a struggle arose about
   the freedom of the will, but this had to do only with moral
   responsibility. Every Muslim was convinced that all laws for human life
   derived from Allah, a factor that created that all-encompassing focus
   for all of Muslim life, the source of the power of their solidarity.
   The worship of Allah and the subjection of everything to Him were not
   two components of the faith, but one.

   We have here the root of both the pride of the Muslim and the command
   to holy war. Only those who bow before Allah and honour His highest
   Prophet were considered genuine human beings, Allah's allies [19] and
   Allah's protected. Because Allah rules everything, only His true
   worshippers can rule on earth. They are the only ones to carry out His
   holy will and honour Him; all others are opponents and enemies.
   Consequently and logically, all individuals and all nations that are
   not part of the Muslim community either partially or wholly, are in a
   state of resistance to Allah, fail to honour Him and go against His
   ordinances. Should mankind raise the sword on behalf of worldly
   interests but not for the highest of interests, namely the honour of
   Allah? Should we shed blood for minor misdeeds but not when human
   beings assault the majesty of Allah, especially if people purposely
   persist in this evil?

   This rigorous concept of holy war would not have gone further than did
   Israel's campaign in Canaan, if Muhammad had brought them a national
   religion as Moses has done. Such a national idea was totally foreign to
   Muhammad. His religion was to be an absolute religion, the religion of
   the world, the only religion. The Muslim community was therefore to
   encompass and rule the entire world. Allah is not a national god.
   Neither is He a god whose revelation is merely temporary or for a time
   as in the case of his temporary arrangements with Israel. That was
   possible at the time of Moses, but no longer, for in Muhammad the final
   revelation appeared. That revelation made high demands of all humanity.
   Islam crossed all borders and where there were still idols or where
   Allah was not acknowledged, people were considered to be in a mode of
   rebellion, of scorn, and of provocation of the Almighty. Therefore, the
   jihad, [20] the holy war against unbelievers, is not an incidental
   matter in the Qur'an, but an obligation that flows directly out of the
   principle of absolute Monotheism, at least, in its Nomistic form. The
   Qur'an states it in a harsh and relentless tone in Sura 9:5--"But when
   the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever
   you find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them
   in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent and establish regular
   prayers and pay Zakat, then open the way for them, for Allah is
   Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." That this harsh commandment was later
   re-interpreted and attributed a "softer" meaning by Muslim authorities
   does not change anything in principle. The Hanifites later declared
   that as long as someone, somewhere, was waging a holy war, the rest of
   the faithful would be relieved of this duty, but the principle itself
   has never been relinquished and, in fact, cannot be renounced. To
   disobey Allah is the greatest of all misdeeds, in fact, the only
   misdeed. All who call upon Allah have the duty to break such resistance
   and to punish that repugnant misdeed.

   Such strict nomistic/legalistic Monotheism is the natural friend of
   democracy and freedom. A clerical class could easily have usurped power
   by inserting itself between the faithful and Allah--thus a power over
   the people next to or in addition to Allah, but this could not be
   tolerated. Even though such a class did arise in the form of the Khalif
   and the Ulama, who did in fact serve as intermediaries, the principle
   that "all people are like the teeth of a comb" as Muhammad used to put
   it, was maintained. There is no central authority that ties the Muslim
   community together. Islam depends on the confession of the faithful.
   That is the only force that keeps it together. Hence the endless
   splinter groups within Islam into sects and cults, almost worse than in
   Christianity. This freedom is inherent to Islam. But in the end, no
   matter how adherents differ from each other, all those who call upon
   Allah and follow the Prophet see themselves as one body, regardless of
   their country of origin.

   Out of this situation an all-pervasive power emerges that is far above
   any hierarchical power. It is exactly this sense of freedom that
   provides every Muslim with a deep consciousness of obligation and
   responsibility for the honour of Allah. Not even the practice of
   circumcision unites them, for which reason it is sometimes grossly
   neglected. Only the confession of Allah and His Prophet unites them.
   Even negligence in worship and failure to adhere to the ordinances of
   the Qur'an and the Sunna can be tolerated and forgiven, as long as the
   believer boldly and openly resists all opposition to Islam and calls
   loudly on Allah and His Prophet. No matter the differences over the
   Caliphate or issues of succession or anything else, even, as is done in
   Zanzibar, supporting a different Sheriphate from that of Mecca, still
   every believer in Islam feels himself one with all his fellow
   believers, as members of the same holy ummah or community. Islam finds
   its unconquerable strength not in some pseudo organization but in the
   personal confession of each Muslim. For that reason, Muhammed neither
   founded a Caliphate dynasty nor appointed a successor. Upon his death,
   the Muslim community itself had to appoint its next leader.

   But there is a darker side to Islam that also flows out of its nomistic
   character, namely its lack of spiritual depth. It knows nothing about
   regeneration or being born again; it does not realize the deeper
   reality of sin and evil; it is short on soteriology or doctrine of
   salvation that goes beyond mere formal declaration of reconciliation.
   This does not mean that it has renounced all higher moral principles.
   To the contrary, if you compare the moral standards in vogue in the
   Arabia of Muhammad's day with his principles, then Islam clearly
   represented progress and higher purpose. His declaration concerning
   marriage and alcohol pointedly collided with the traditional immoral
   standards in the areas of sex and alcohol. But this was no more than a
   repositioning of the principial line that indicated the new norm.
   Muhammad himself was infatuated with sex. [21] By breaching his own
   prohibition of having more than four wives he reduced the seriousness
   of this restriction. The provision of concubinage of female slaves
   further lowered his ethical and moral standards.

   It is therefore impossible to develop a higher level of domestic life
   under Islam: It prevents women from reaching their full potential. The
   loose and easy divorce introduced by Muhammad may have been an
   improvement over the customs of the day, but it, too, served to keep
   the ethical level of Islam low. As soon as you compare the moral
   standards of Christendom with those of Islam, you will immediately note
   the profound difference. On the moral side, Islam is a system of
   accommodation, a partial elevation of the low level he found on the
   ground, but definitely not a return to first [creational] principles.
   His self-presentation as the last and final divine ambassador
   constituted a serious obstacle, for that forever cut off the
   possibility of developing a higher ethical standard in the future. This
   ethical norm may have been progress over the existing moral level, but
   it was still at a low principial level and so it has remained ever
   since among Muslims. It has served to weaken the seriousness of their
   moral life. [22]

   All of this can only be explained by the nomism or legalism of Islam
   and the absence of any attempt to raise the moral life through
   regeneration or being born again. The Christian emphasis on the
   contrast between the old and the new born-again person is completely
   foreign to Islam. This situation has not prevented the rise of
   revivals, as for example the Wahabis, that represented a return to more
   puritanical attitudes, or the various Mahdi movements with similar
   goals. But such movements never elevated themselves morally beyond the
   standards of the Qur'an. Whenever moral standards sunk below those of
   the Qur'an, Muslims were called upon to return to its standards, but it
   never came to a process of ethical development that welled up from the
   ethical principle itself. [23] That did not and could not happen.

   Christendom has its three pillars on which it rests: faith, hope and
   love. Or, if you prefer: regeneration, faith and sanctification. In
   contrast, Islam has five pillars that support the religion: faith in
   Allah and His Prophet; prayer; fasting in the month of Ramadan; alms
   giving; pilgrimage to Mecca. Nothing demonstrates the external
   character that so disfigures Islam more than this row of pillars when
   set side by side. Even Muhammad's expectation for the afterlife betrays
   a similar lack of ethical elevation. To be sure, Muslim scholars have
   repeatedly sought to allegorize the rough outlines of the Paradise
   image Muhammed held up before his followers, but it remains a fact that
   most Muslims understand Paradise in a purely sensual sense. Muhammad's
   language was purposefully designed to imprint that sensual image
   permanently.

   It was only the mystics, in their ascetic as well as their ecstatic
   strains, who provided a more holy glow for this barren ethical scheme.
   It would be doing Islam an injustice if we were to regard this
   mysticism as a totally foreign implant in the garden of Islam.
   Mysticism is an indispensable component of all legalistic religions,
   but it is not for everyone. The lifestyle of the masses is too
   superficial for this approach. Mysticism requires a special aptitude
   and a unique orientation of the spirit, so that it always is the
   monopoly of a small group. You do not find much of mysticism in the
   Qur'an, for it addresses the masses. Neither would it need to be in the
   Qur'an, for regardless of which form the religion were to adopt,
   mysticism develops spontaneously as soon as its seed is present. Even
   though it does not win over the masses, it always commands respect,
   especially in nomistic or legalistic circles. Thus it can be said that
   this spontaneously-erupted mysticism, though always behind the veil of
   officialdom, has deepened and intensified the emotional and spiritual
   life of the people. Without the mystical movements such as the
   Dervishes, Sufism and other forms, Islam would definitely not have
   retained the spiritual power that millions and millions of Allah
   worshippers continue to exude, especially not after the cessation of
   holy wars. Without this glow of mysticism, Pan-Islam would simply be
   unthinkable.

   It is possible to debate the question whether the more rigid form of
   asceticism did not emerge long after Muhammad. It is generally agreed
   that the Qur'an excludes rather than encourages the mystical version of
   asceticism. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the ecstatic
   visionary founder of Islam himself found part of his powers in
   mysticism. Besides, mysticism is such an integral part of the Semitic
   worldview that it is impossible to imagine a Semitic religion--and
   Islam is and will always remain that--without this mysterious
   background of mysticism.

   But even if we accept mysticism as an inseparable ingredient of Islam,
   this will never serve to elevate its ethical standard. All mysticism is
   religion-specific and as such never adopts an imposed ethical
   character. Even in its ascetic form it merely aims either to achieve
   communion with the Divine Being or to insure its salvation after death.
   It normally does not have any influence on moral life in society.
   Rather, history teaches that all mysticism throughout the ages tends to
   end up "in the flesh," that is to say, become "worldly," even though it
   begins "in the spirit."

   If Islam had spread exclusively in regions where idolatry and
   Polytheism constituted the traditional religion, as in Arabia itself or
   in parts of Persia, we would be able to understand how the higher
   religion of Islam without great difficulty would have pushed out these
   lower religions. The riddle that the rapid rise of Islam confronts us
   with is that it almost exclusively spread in fully Christianized
   nations and that in these higher cultures this even higher Christianity
   disappeared almost without a trace after only a short struggle. I have
   already done full justice to the inspiration inherent in Monotheism. I
   have expressed full appreciation for the enthusiasm instilled in the
   emotions by the command for holy war, while I also have fully accounted
   for the enthusiasm generated by the consciousness that the faithful
   were to dominate the entire world. To all these factors we must also
   add that the militant spirit and the lust for booty, so native to the
   Arab, were among the less noble factors that led to the triumph of
   Islam.

Reasons for Rapid Muslim Subjugation of Christianity

   But none of this explains the painfully rapid subjugation of the
   Christian religion in Asia and Africa. When Islam suddenly raised its
   head in the seventh century, Christianity had been the state religion
   in the eastern regions of the Roman Empire of Byzantium for well over
   three centuries. It had penetrated Asia as far as Arabia, Persia and
   Indonesia, and the greater part of North Africa, including Egypt. North
   Africa had already hosted Christian synods of more than 500 bishops.
   Men with the highest talents that are till this day highly revered in
   the Church, served in Egypt and Carthage. Origenes, Athanasius,
   Cyprianus, Augustine and, before him, Tertullian, had taught there.
   There may have been an element of pseudo-Christianity, but the most
   severe and most cruel persecutions that took place in these regions
   caused the holy courage of the martyrs, both men and women, to shine
   even brighter. The most splendid cathedrals had arisen and the most
   famous schools for the training of the clergy had been established
   throughout Byzantine Asia and along the entire north coast of Africa.
   The Christian Church was not only tolerated, but she was the supreme
   power, while all traces of the earlier Paganism had been exterminated,
   mostly by imperial command. The Church existed there in a state of
   unprecedented bloom and was fully intending to penetrate Asia and
   Africa still deeper, all the way to Ethiopia and Sudan. Furthermore,
   the Christian religion did not merely float on the surface as a drop of
   oil on water, but it shaped the cultures of peoples in their deepest
   dimensions. Wherever struggles arose in the Church, entire nations
   would get involved.

   If you were to visit these regions today, you would hardly find a trace
   of this Christian history in Africa, with the exception of Ethiopia and
   half a million Coptics in Egypt. In Asia, you would find here and there
   a few residual groups of Greeks, Marionites and Armenians as pitiful
   remnants of the once magnificent Byzantine State Church. And then
   realize that Islam conquered these peoples not after a struggle of many
   centuries, but as it were with one fell swoop. This series of facts
   confronts us today as an almost inexplicable problem, the solution to
   which must be found in two factors, namely, the internal condition of
   the church at the time and the style of Islamic propaganda. It is on
   these that we will now focus.

   Originally, the Christian Church in the East tried to spread its
   tentacles by means of quiet evangelism. As long as she retained this
   mode, she retained her internal health. However, before long,
   Christianity began to penetrate wider circles. It was among them that
   Greek and Eastern philosophies in their many varieties re-interpreted
   the mysteries of the Gospel and distorted them according to their own
   philosophies. History teaches us about the struggles of the Church
   during the second century to wrestle itself loose from the embrace of
   Gnosticism, Doceticism and, later, Manicheism. A spirit of
   dissatisfaction arose in the East with respect to their own heritage.
   This lead to a tendency to welcome and incorporate every new religion
   into a new syncretism. This process meant that such new religions were
   distorted and then smothered. True, the silent majority of the masses
   continued in the faith, but they did not determine the direction of
   things. In contrast, the educated upper crust who propagated their
   theoretical concoctions in writing and taught in the academies,
   increasingly sought their inspiration and power in a philosophical
   frame on which they elegantly embroidered the flowers of the Christian
   religion--as they saw them. This process caused an increasing distance
   from the roots of the faith and led to attempts to seek the essence of
   Christianity in various philosophical and dogmatic systems that found
   their strength not in spiritual inspiration but in arid, scholastic
   dialectics. Worse, some undermined the structure of Christian truth by
   replacing its foundation with that of Pagan philosophy. Since these
   systems and schools of thought began to oppose each other, before she
   realized what was happening, the Church became enmeshed in bitter
   arguments and divisions. Most of the debates focused on the centre of
   the Christian religion, i.e. on the person of Christ Himself. They no
   longer gratefully accepted in faith the incomprehensible mystery of the
   incarnation, that is, of God becoming man, but began to dissect and
   sift the mysteries of the faith in a rationalistic way. One
   philosophical explanation of this mystery was pitted against another,
   all of them claiming for themselves the inspired faith of the masses
   and uttering warnings to their opponents that they were shortchanging
   the majesty of Christ. The Church had no choice but to intervene in
   these controversies by way of a series of Conciliar Councils [meetings
   of the church's hierarchy] in order to discern the truth or otherwise
   of these philosophical and dogmatic schools of thought. Arians,
   Nestorians, Monophysites and Monotheletes were successively declared
   heretics and pushed beyond the pale of the Church.

   The ordinary people participated in these struggles. Frequently they
   even resorted to violence and came to physical blows. The sad outcome
   of all of this was that the entire Body of Christ was torn and members
   confronted each other in hostile camps. This did not only destroy the
   unity of the Church but also its strength, because the zeal of the
   Christian religion for the mysteries of the holy faith diminished in
   favour of dialectic skirmishes. Gradually what was to be a religion of
   the heart and which was to bloom in faith, hope and love, became rigid
   and arid in a mode of thought in which the heart went cold and froze
   up. While Byzantine scholars engrossed themselves restlessly in dogmas
   about Christ, the love for Christ in their hearts dampened, while the
   mystical union of the believer with his Christ slowly faded away and
   dissolved.

   And then, as if all this philosophical stupor, dialectical confusion
   and Byzantine dampening of the spirit were not enough, there appeared
   on the horizon a second force that would undermine genuine
   Christianity, namely the Ceasaropapism introduced by Emperor
   Constantine the Great. Now it was not a case of the State seeking a
   deep alliance with the Church of Christ, but, rather, of the Church
   being placed under the guardianship of the State. This new relationship
   lead to unprecedented external flowering of the Church in two ways.
   First, entire tribes were "converted" by force, as later was the case
   also with Charlemagne and in the provinces around the Baltic Sea.
   Paganism was rejected. Its temples were either demolished or turned
   into churches, its altars crushed and its schools closed by imperial
   order. Secondly, there were those among the powerbrokers and elite who
   used to engage in sun worship, but who, now that the Christian religion
   was part of the establishment, bowed their knees before the Cross in
   order to achieve high prestige in the State. These two elements spelled
   numerical increase for the church, but it weakened her internally,
   spiritually. None of this added anything to Christ's glory in a
   spiritual way. People draped themselves in Christian garb, but no
   change occurred in their hearts. This made the Church appear a soulless
   entity. [24]

   The story is not yet finished. After the State had turned the Church
   into an attachment, church affairs became affairs of state. The Emperor
   and his lackeys interfered in all church affairs. Originally
   Constantine announced that he would concern himself only with the
   externals of the Church, while the internals were left to the Church
   itself. This was a healthy principle, but it was soon suppressed when
   ecclesiastical infighting threatened the peace and power of the State.
   The Emperor had no choice but to interfere, take sides and exorcise
   attempts to create division. Hence, time and again he applied the
   weight of the State to ecclesiastical life. This in turn led each of
   the opposing parties to give priority to currying the favour of the
   imperial Court. It was common knowledge that the side favoured by the
   Emperor and supported by the Court was assured of victory. The great
   Conciliar Councils continued to protect the terrain and power of the
   church. We have good reason to admire the courage and resilience with
   which these leaders tried to maintain the independence of the Church.
   However, after the decisions had been made and the delegates returned
   to their dioceses, the decisions had to be turned into actions--and
   this was in the hands of the Emperor. And so politics joined philosophy
   and dialectics to undermine the Church.

   The spiritual condition of the Church deteriorated seriously. It
   harboured too many false elements and was constantly pulled farther
   away from its roots. Finally, exhausted from all her controversies, it
   lost its resistance to becoming a mere tool in the hands of nitpicking
   scholars, power-hungry princes of the Church and sly politicians.
   Warnings against such developments already appeared in the seven
   letters to the churches of Asia Minor in the New Testament book of
   Revelations, chapters 2-3. There it was predicted that the hour would
   come that the candlestick would be taken away from them and false
   philosophies devastate the Church. Christ would come like a thief in
   the night to undo her and spit her out of His mouth because of her
   lukewarm state.

   It was while the Christian Church was in the above pitiful condition
   that Islam arose, suddenly attacked her, made her shake on her
   foundations and saw to the demise of almost all her splendid
   cathedrals. Of course, God not only allowed this all to happen, but He
   willed it. Anyone who believes in the royal reign of Christ over His
   Church must recognize the hand of God in this destruction of the Church
   by the Muslims as a justified penalty for her unfaithfulness. [25] It
   was in the West that the Christian religion was to triumph, not in the
   East. The East was exhausted. Only in the West, under the instigation
   of the Germanic peoples, would the church bloom. In the East, only
   little remnants would remain in order to remind us of the great Church
   of Christ that once was. Nothing touches the emotions of faith of the
   traveler through these lands of Asia and Africa more than to see how in
   all these countries the Church not only suffered fearful devastation
   but totally disappeared. The slowly corroding ruins of churches in
   which once the Halleluiah was raised, are all that reminds the traveler
   of the ancient glory of Christendom in these regions. Apart from the
   Arabs who came from elsewhere, all the ancestors of the Muslims who
   surround the traveler were once baptized Christians. Our martyrs who
   astounded the world with their stalwart courage, came from those
   generations. It was Christian in a much more intimate way than what you
   find in much of today's European Christendom. And all of this
   Christianity is eradicated lock, stock and barrel, so that we are left
   without a trace. Even customs and traditions that once marked domestic
   and social life as well as the religious and moral life of these
   nations--not a trace of that can be found today. At the same time, you
   will find that under Islam, Pagan influences that were thought to have
   been forgotten, returned to the surface, especially among the Berbers,
   but of the Christian religion you will find nothing. Even the holy
   symbol of the Cross is no more to be seen in even a single monument.
   There is nothing, absolutely nothing that remains to remind you of the
   ancient Christian confession of their forefathers. We do recognize that
   the small remnants of the Church of Christ in Egypt, Syria and Asia
   Minor have been influenced by Islam in their morals, customs and even
   in their mode of worship, while among the great populations of Islam
   you will find no trace, however faint, of the former Christianity. This
   hurts immensely. This situation is spiritually depressing and must lead
   to somber reflection. You constantly hope you will come across some
   reminder somewhere, but you find nothing. No name, no sign, no sound.
   The ruins tell you that this was once the land of Christians, but
   provide no clue about that past. As a swarm of locusts descends on an
   orchard and devours all the leaves and blossoms to leave only bare
   branches, so has Islam in those countries totally devoured and
   dissected the Christian orchard till nothing was left.

   And now, how did it go with the Muslim mission that caused such a
   destructive ending for Christendom? I am not now speaking of the harsh
   manner with which Muhammad himself and the Caliphs after him turned
   against the Arab Pagans and against the numerous Jews in Medina and
   surroundings. These idolaters and Jews simply had the sword put to
   their throat. They had to adopt Islam or pay the supreme price. But
   this is not where the riddle I am talking about is to be found. These
   Jews were also among the lower cultures whose Cabalism had caused them
   to wither spiritually and who later sided with Muslims against
   Christians. The puzzling question is what enabled Islam to so
   relentlessly pursue its unprecedented success without interruption when
   it confronted the Christian Church that was so powerful at the time and
   ranked spiritually and morally so much higher than Muhammad's religion.
   Of course, the violence of the sword terrified the people, but we make
   a mistake if we imagine that the horsemen that turned up in Syria,
   Persia and Egypt from Arabia simply put to the sword all who refused to
   convert to Islam. Instead, they occupied their lands, they evicted
   those in power and replaced them. They presented themselves as the
   rulers and, since nothing could withstand the power of their sword,
   they behaved as lords and masters of the land.

   But this is very different from actually conquering the spirit, even
   though that is what eventually happened. With the exception of a few
   small remnants, all the descendants of former Christians are today
   Muslim in heart and soul. This result was not and could not have been
   reached by violence and force alone. Rather, this spiritual
   transformation took place very gradually. However, in contrast to Asia
   and Africa, in the European part of Turkey, including all its former
   Balkan vassal states, by far the majority have remained Christian till
   this day.

Contours of the EarlyMuslim Jihad

   Muhammad and his followers definitely did not place Christians and
   Pagans on the same level. They distinguished sharply between those who
   bowed before idols and those who stood by the revelations of Moses and
   Jesus. After all, according to Islam, Moses and Jesus also honoured
   Islam. Their revelations are all recognized as being of divine origin,
   the difference between them being that the revelation to Muhammad was
   higher, came later and went further. Thus Christians were viewed as
   knowing Allah at an earlier period and were walking the right path.
   They only went wrong when they refused to accept the later and higher
   revelation. This and this only was their offence. It is similar to the
   way Christians honour the Jews in so far as they follow Moses, but we
   fault them only for being blind towards the later and fuller revelation
   that came in Christ. So Muslims judge that Christians did indeed obey
   the revelation that till that point was the highest, but they willfully
   closed their eyes to the even higher light that came with Muhammad.
   Here they determined the limits of the Holy Book. Jews had the Holy
   Book of the Old Testament; Christians honoured the Holy Book of the Old
   and New Testament, but both rejected the even holier Book of the
   Qur'an. But even though, according to Muhammad's judgement, the others
   were at a lower level, they could be tolerated as backward or deficient
   kindred. That is why all Christians were not only tolerated but were
   given a degree of freedom of worship, on condition that they
   acknowledge the authority of the Muslim ruler, if not in religion, at
   least in politics.

   From the beginning this demand for nations and non-Muslims to
   acknowledge the superiority of Islam governed their relationship. Since
   Allah is omnipotent over the entire world, His faithful warriors are
   automatically entitled to control that entire world. Strictly speaking,
   only the followers of Islam have a right to exist or human rights.
   Allah is the Lord of lords, while the supreme leader of Islam is His
   representative on earth. With this high sense of calling, in 629 AD or
   thereabouts, thus only five years after the hijira, before his power
   was secure in Mecca, Muhammad wrote a letter to all neighbouring
   rulers, even to the King of Persia and the Emperor at Constantinople,
   in which he called upon all these rulers to convert to Islam and to
   subject their lands and peoples to the Prophet of Mecca. [26] These
   letters were marked by his seal that read, "Muhammad the Representative
   of Allah." It may seem strange, but these letters written by the head
   of a new, unknown, cult actually made a deep impression. In Arabia, the
   rulers of Yemen and Bahrain submitted immediately. The response of the
   Christian ruler of Ethiopia was friendly. The Byzantine viceroy of
   Egypt demonstrated his cowardice by sending Muhammad two young Coptic
   girls for his harem. Last but not least, Emperor Heraclius of
   Constantinople responded in very courteous terms. Only Khosrau II, King
   of Persia, in quick-tempered fashion, tore up the letter in the
   presence of the messenger and instructed his general to find Muhammad,
   attack him and take him prisoner forthwith. If nothing else, these
   letters demonstrated the position of Islam from its early inception.
   How strong must his conviction of his own exalted position have been,
   to dare to make such a bold demand for total subjection to the most
   powerful rulers around him, even the prestigious Emperor of
   Constantinople, while his own domain was no more than a small strip of
   territory. [27] But it is precisely to this strong consciousness of
   divine calling and of his God-given supremacy over the entire world
   that Islam owes its inextinguishable enthusiasm and the indomitable
   courage of its horsemen by which he simultaneously pursued the
   strongest propaganda and overtook the mightiest of spirits by surprise.
   Islam did not negotiate with any earthly power on basis of equality but
   demanded that everyone simply capitulate, that is, that everyone
   recognize the supremacy of the Commander of Islam and accept all
   conditions of peace from him as grace or favour. The "capitulations" in
   vogue those days were treaties of subjugation in which the victorious
   sovereign would grant certain privileges to his new vassal only as a
   free privilege. The same situation obtained when it came to tolerance
   granted to Jews and Christians in any country militarily occupied by
   Muslims. They would find favour in the eyes of a conqueror only on
   condition that they recognize his right to rule over them and, if
   necessary, to force them to accept Islam, with violence even. The
   tolerance awarded Christians was also such a "capitulation." Under
   whatever conditions they capitulated, granting them tolerance was pure
   grace.

   [26] In a fine modern touch and, I suspect, in imitation of these
   letters from the Prophet, Khomeini wrote a similar letter to Gorbachov
   during their days in power (The Pen, a discontinued Nigerian Muslim
   bi-weekly, 27 January, 1989, p. 8).

   Wikipedia article "Khosrau II:"

Christian Dhimmi Status

   Christians in a land militarily occupied by Muslims have only three
   choices. The first is to adopt Islam so as to be absorbed into the
   faithful. The second is to pay the special tax known as jizya, which
   turns them into dhimmi or second-class citizens. The third is simply to
   be killed by the sword. Choosing to pay the tax is in effect to submit
   and thereby to accept conditions of tolerance that were painful and
   humiliating. These treaties or, as they are sometimes called,
   "covenants" were all designed to socially oppress and humiliate. When
   Omar conquered Jerusalem, he included the following conditions in the
   decree of capitulation often referred to as the "Covenant of Umar:"
   [28] (1) Christians are free to worship in their churches, but Muslims
   are allowed to attend at any time, day or night; (2) they will never
   perform their worship services on the street; (3) they will not teach
   the Qur'an to their children; (4) they will not convert anyone to their
   religion; (5) they will not hinder anyone from becoming Muslim; (6)
   they will always give Muslims the highest seat of honour in their
   meetings; (7) they will not dress like Muslims (8) they will never
   write in Arabic, the glorious language of Islam; (9) they will not
   adopt Muslim names; (10) they will not ride on large saddles; (11) they
   will never carry weapons; (12) they will shave their beards; (13) they
   will never place crosses on their churches; (14) they will never play
   their carillons; (15) they will bury their dead without public display;
   (16) they will never harbour a slave that belongs to a Muslim; (17)
   they will never peek into Muslim houses; (18) they will never raise a
   hand against a Muslim. These conditions were to be accepted at the time
   of the capitulation for themselves and their descendants. Should they
   ever fail to strictly observe any of these conditions, they would in
   effect concede to Omar the right to apply any penalty against them that
   is due to a sovereign over against rebel subjects.

   In Egypt, these conditions were made even heavier. Christians were
   obligated to carry a wooden cross of considerable weight around the
   neck, while they also were forced to wear very dark and almost
   dishonourable clothes. Every Christian was made to feel deeply that
   every Muslim was of higher status, that in public life only Muslims
   counted for full and that they were in fact marginalized from society.
   It soon became clear that this harsh treatment of a subjugated people
   was less inspired by Islam than by a lust for spoils. [29] The Khalif
   wanted to see money at every turn. The more the head tax yielded, the
   happier he was. When that tax began to shrink because the payers
   converted to Islam, this conversion was greeted at the Court in Baghdad
   with some misgiving. In Egypt the yield of the tax diminished within a
   few years from ten to three million dinars, a painful statistic of
   Christian apostasy. Amr bin Al-As, the general who conquered Egypt but
   who did not send enough money from this rich country to the Khalif's
   Court or for the construction of the large mosque in Jerusalem, was
   eventually even recalled and replaced by Abdullah, who was a more
   willing tool.

   Even though Muslims exerted little pressure on Christians to convert,
   the social humiliation inflicted on them in the long run proved to be
   unbearable. Persecution steels and stimulates; it fires up a holy
   enthusiasm and revives heroism, but never-ending social humiliation
   depletes energy and leads eventually to total collapse. Imagine being
   excluded from everything prestigious and honourable, constantly to be
   treated like an inferior, to be held back at all fronts, to see your
   family move about with oppressive inferiority, your children robbed of
   any future improvement, to be walking around in shameful clothes day
   after day. And then, on the contrary, to see everyone who accepts Islam
   crowned with honour, helped to advance and gain in power. This contrast
   constitutes life-long torture that at the end becomes too heavy to
   bear. And then to realize that with only one word it is possible to
   throw off this yoke, to be free from the head tax, and to open for
   yourself and for your children the path to honour and power. And come
   to think of it, Islam did not demand a lot. The kiss [of peace] was
   offered as soon as you call upon Allah and His Prophet. This is the
   temptation for which entire Christian families, century after century,
   have fallen. To be sure, there has also been courageous resistance and
   energetic opposition so that whoever digs deeply into this sad history
   of nameless suffering will experience profound admiration for the
   toughness and the unyielding spirit with which numerous families
   preferred this harsh humiliation to denying Christ. But this fire of
   holy faith could only glow where faith had sunk deeply into the
   heart--and that was exactly where the masses were lacking. For this
   reason, the masses gradually moved over to Islam, family after family.
   As the number of Christian families in the cities and villages
   gradually diminished, it became increasingly difficult for the remnant
   to hold out. As apostasy of others became the pattern, your own
   apostasy seemed less sinful. And so it was that, with the exception of
   small remnants, everywhere in Asia and Africa entire nations were
   converted to Islam.

The Muslim Cultural Expansion (Al-Azhar University)

   Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to imagine that actual missionary
   propaganda played only a minor role in these developments. During its
   initial period of bloom, Islam developed a high level of intellectual
   life. It is well known how the Arabs were the pioneers of scholarship
   and science in much of Asia, Africa and even in Europe for four
   centuries. Islam wanted to rule all of life, not only the religious but
   also the social, juridical and political aspects. The more Muslims
   wanted to dominate a cultural sector, the stronger the impulse to work
   out the consequences of Islam. Every principle of the Qur'an in all its
   consequences and applications had to be thought through theologically,
   politically and juridically. In this process, various differences of
   opinion cropped up that had to be solved by way of debate and dialogue.
   Schools of thought arose, one after the other, each offering its own
   perspective on life. Greek philosophy was translated and called in to
   help, so that it once again became accessible, even for Europe. This
   access stimulated interest in studying. First rate brilliant minds
   competed with each other for the highest laurels. So it happened that,
   while Christian Europe hardly bestirred itself at the level of
   scholarship, in the land of Islam a high level of scholarship prevailed
   century after century, that even today demands the highest respect and
   assured its domination over the minds of the peoples of Asia and
   Africa. The public opinion of the ruling classes, who by their higher
   development controlled the spirit of the populace, leaned increasingly
   on Islam, while Christians, bereft of their schools, sunk into
   obscurity and hung on to a tradition that was no longer understood and
   thus marginalized.

   The Muslim tradition, as much as it was able, constantly tried to
   attach schools to mosques. From the beginning it was bent on spreading
   knowledge. Our pedagogy is different from theirs. That of Islam
   concentrates on memory and on imprinting strong conviction more than on
   developing your own thinking. The influence of these primary schools
   and, especially, of their madrasah or higher schools was most profound.
   Every degree of skepticism was excluded. Incised deeply, the mind
   received the imprint of the Islamic spirit so that, because of the very
   strong development of the memory, what was received in school stayed
   with them throughout life and controlled thought decisively. Muslims
   therefore were never at a loss when they confronted other opinions.
   They were saturated with what they advocated; their strong memory never
   disappointed them when it came to arguing their convictions.
   Furthermore, that conviction was simple in content. Over against
   Christians they always had the argument ready at hand that the former
   actually placed a second god next to Allah and thus by their own
   confession of Christ did violence to the purity of Monotheism. They did
   not reject Jesus. In fact, they honoured Him above Moses, but they did
   so in a manner purer and better than Christians, for Islam freed their
   picture of Christ from all the dogmatic reconstructions with which the
   falsification of the original Gospel had surrounded Him. This actually
   was the same type of argument that causes so many people today to
   forsake their confession of Christ. This was the thrust of the dominant
   public propaganda that pulled public opinion with it in its wake and
   over against which Christians were helpless.

   But there was more to it. Especially the University of Al-Azhar in
   Cairo played an important pioneering role. This grand institution at
   its zenith had up to 20,000 registered students and, even though it
   suffered a period of decline, is currently once again the spiritual and
   scholarly centre for Islam. It was founded in 975 AD by Djawhar
   al-Katib al-Sikilli in the city of Cairo that itself had only recently
   been established by the Fatimids. [30] The Fatimid Khalifs, who
   rebelled against the Khalifs of Baghdad, were originally Shi'ites and
   as such honoured Ali. They followed the rites of the Shafites, not
   those of the school of the Hanifites. There was tension between the
   Baghdad schools and them. In fact, the Khalifs of Baghdad pronounced
   them heretics. This created the need for the Fatimids to establish
   their own centre for scholarship. The University of Al-Azhar can trace
   its beginning to this need. The Fatimids did all they could to lure the
   most famous Arab scholars with high salaries and high prestige. It did
   not take long for the new school to achieve a high reputation. Students
   from all over the Muslim world came to Cairo to follow the lectures. In
   the endless disputes between Baghdad and Cairo that continued for two
   centuries, Cairo usually had the last word.

   The first to put an end to all this disunity in the bosom of Islam was
   Salah al-Din, more commonly known as Saladin, after he conquered Egypt.
   He began by restoring recognition of the authority of the Khalifs of
   Baghdad and joining the Sunnis. However, not wanting the Egyptian
   scholars to oppose him, he decided that the Shafites could stay, but
   that from that point on, the other recognized Sunni schools of thought,
   namely the Hanifites, Malakites and Hanbalites, should also be
   represented on the faculty, each enjoying complete freedom to teach
   theology and jurisprudence in their own way. This only served to
   increase the reputation of Al-Azhar. Now scholars from all the schools
   came to curry the favour of the Egyptian ruler. And so it happened that
   from the time of Saladin, Al-Azhar became the great centre of Islamic
   scholarship. Lectures were offered in literature, theology and
   jurisprudence; sometimes also in astronomy, mathematics and science.

   The Turkish capture of Egypt closed the University's first blossoming
   chapter. They were characterized by a different spirit. In addition,
   their entry into Egypt coincided with a natural turn of the tide in
   Arabic scholarship. This scholarship had as good as reached its goals
   completely. In spite of much struggle and in-fighting, the grammatical
   studies, as well as those in theology and jurisprudence, had matured,
   resulting in research having come to a close. This stage of scholarship
   was completed. Differences of opinion had disappeared. In each area a
   kind of common mind had been achieved so that from now on there was no
   need for any further study, except to defend that which had already
   been established or agreed upon. This snapped the resilience of Islamic
   scholarship in the middle of the 16^th century and left her with
   nothing but a bare, conservative character that it has retained till
   this day. But as the authority of this conservative tradition preserved
   Islamic scholarship, so does the Al-Azhar of today [1907] serve as a
   significant agent for the preservation of Islam, more even than it did
   during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,

   The very expansive building in which the lectures are presented is very
   close to the graves of the Khalifs and borders on one of the first
   mosques of Cairo. If the weather is suitable, and that is almost always
   the case in Cairo, the lectures are held out in the open in an outside
   courtyard surrounded by a porch with pillars. You will find no trace
   here of stiff scholastic forms. Every lecturer surrounds himself in
   this open air space with whoever wants to listen, while the students
   contribute to their own education by fielding questions and comments.
   If they do not approve of the lecturer's line of reasoning, they will
   interrupt him so that he has to explain himself further. Each of the
   four schools has at its head a sheikh or doctor, while the entire
   school has a rector as head sheikh. During the days of Muhammad Ali,
   this head sheikh would position himself as the Sheikh-ul-Islam to
   compete with the Khalif of Constantinople in prestige. This rector is
   practically always of the Shafite school, as a continuation of the old
   Fatimid tradition. Only once, during the 19^th century, did a Hanifite
   by the name El-Mahdin El-Abassi occupy the position, but in 1887 he was
   again succeeded by a Shafite.

   The rector, sheiks and lecturers are all chosen by the entire academic
   corps. Only the Hanifite who interrupted the line of Shafites was
   appointed by Viceroy Ishmael Pacha. Foreigners are often given
   preference, because they will draw students from their own country and
   thus help Al-Azhar to develop a more international Islamic character.
   There is no entrance exam; anyone may follow the lectures. I even found
   little boys there and, what I had expected even less, there were even a
   few little girls. These children learned reading, writing and Arabic
   grammar and with that they are taught to memorize some of the easier
   chapters of the Qur'an. This study, or, rather, memorization, and the
   ability to write Qur'anic passages, continues throughout the entire
   initial period. After that, they move on to the study of commentaries,
   logic, rhetoric, dialectic and of the art of poetry. During the final
   period, time is devoted to the higher studies of Islamic theology and
   jurisprudence. An average student requires fifteen to sixteen years for
   this entire course of studies. If someone begins at age six, he will
   have completed all these lower and higher studies at twenty-two. Even
   then there are no final examinations, nor is there any official
   declaration of graduation, but, on basis of all the courses he
   followed, the graduate can claim the title "Sheikh." By far the
   greatest number break off their studies after they have completed the
   lower phase, usually around age fourteen. Only those who have given
   evidence of superior intelligence continue their studies at the higher
   level.

   It should be noted that most foreigners enroll at a much later age. You
   find people there thirty years of age and older. For example, I found a
   number of adult Javanese, whom I invited to my hotel and with whom I
   had an interesting discussion with the help of our consul as
   interpreter. They had gone to Mecca and from there were sent on to
   Cairo, because of their special religious zeal and their great
   intelligence. They had taken on prestigious names like Muhammad and
   Omar and appeared rather pleased with themselves.

   The University has a boarding facility that has rooms large enough for
   up to 40 students to live together, usually from the same area. Each
   student has a locker. Once a year, needy students are given a free
   outfit. They can also avail themselves of free, simple meals of dry
   bread and vegetables cooked in water. There are always water carriers
   with their leather bags, walking around for the thirsty. Order is
   preserved by security guards, burly men with respect-inducing clubs. I
   observed a little rascal teasing a nearly-blind female lecturer. (In
   Egypt some people are almost completely blinded by an indigenous eye
   disease.) This lady had so memorized the Qur'an that she could continue
   her teaching of the Qur'an. The only problem she had was to point to
   the correct words with her fingers on the printed page. Now this rascal
   thought it fun to push the page upward without her noticing it, so that
   she pointed to the wrong line that said something else, while the boy
   laughingly observed her. But it did not take long for a security man to
   notice. He gave him a sharp blow and immediately ended this ignoble
   scene.

   The numerous needy young men studying at Al-Azhar live off gifts and
   small earnings. The old system of "bettelstudent" or beggar student
   still operates here. Quite a few students even work during the day as
   doorkeeper, load carrier, peddler or clerk. During the evening they ask
   other students to inform them about the day's lectures.

   Students have vacation for three months, during which time they return
   home to raise money, engage in small business and, wherever possible,
   spread knowledge about the Qur'an or lead unbelievers to Islam. Thus it
   is that Islam, not just recently but through the centuries, constantly,
   without letup and bit by bit, proceeds with its mission work. To be
   sure, there are more wealthy Muslims who devote their wealth to send
   missionaries to isolated regions, but this is not where the great
   influence of Islamic mission is to be found. That influence comes
   mostly through ordinary students, who during their travels and
   wanderings ply their trades but quietly and unobtrusively win
   unbelievers for Islam, especially in Pagan areas. The same process is
   at work in the Dutch Indonesian Archipelago, where most people are
   slowly won for Islam by the same method. These former students of
   Al-Azhar remain zealots for their faith throughout their lives and,
   totally on their own without any stipend, conduct their propaganda in a
   quiet manner. [31]

   In addition, most khadis and imams graduate from Al-Azhar, as well as
   the fakirs, a class of poor and often ascetic mendicants and dervishes,
   who are generally hired by wealthy Muslims as governors or nannies to
   teach the children and to lead in daily family prayers. By this
   arrangement the influence of this University spread throughout the land
   and far beyond, while the sheikhs serve governments with advice in all
   things religious. For example, recently they published an extensive
   public declaration condemning the Mahdi in Sudan. Thanks to this
   prestigious religious authority of Al-Azhar, every itinerant
   teacher-pupil who engages in mission comes with a letter of
   recommendation in hand.

Additional Reasons for Christian Capitulation

   Nevertheless, even in this kind of mission, the main point of
   attraction Islam exudes lies in the notion that when you join Islam,
   you will be taken up into the religious aristocracy of this world. This
   is the ancient Jewish idea of the chosen people that, shed by Islam of
   all its nationalistic baggage, morphed into the notion of world
   supremacy. The entire world belongs to Islam and all those converted to
   Islam have both the right and the calling to carry out this world
   supremacy. Muslims have turned upside-down Jesus' comment to Pilate,
   "My kingdom is not of this world, otherwise my servants would fight."
   Their kingdom is of this world and they may [Translator: "must"?] fight
   over it with the sword. This raises their self-image to a whole new and
   higher level. By becoming Muslim, you are incorporated into the
   aristocracy, not merely of a country, but of the entire world. This
   gratifies human pride and especially works magic on the lower classes.
   As I have explained earlier, this prominent feeling is by no means the
   least of the factors that have helped Muslims triumph over collapsed
   and internally divided Christian communities.

   And then, not to forget, Christians suppressed by non-Muslim regimes
   not infrequently embraced the approaching Muslims as liberators. The
   Byzantine State Church persecuted dissenting sects harshly and so these
   sects owed the regaining of their freedom to the arrival of the Arabs.
   As the French Protestants cheered the Revolution of 1779, because it
   delivered them from almost three centuries of oppression by the Roman
   Catholic Church, so did the suppressed Christian sects not infrequently
   welcome the Arabs as liberators and join them in common cause. [32]

   Finally, medieval Europe experienced a deep sense of divine judgment,
   even in its legal system. This was not like the kind of fatalism with
   which Muslims accept temporary occupation of their territories by
   non-Muslims. Rather, it meant that in the struggle between Christianity
   and Islam, the outcome seemed to prove that Muhammad was right and that
   his mission would triumph over that of Jesus. You should keep in mind
   that changing religion was nothing unusual in Asia or Egypt. Whenever a
   new ruler took over, he would either recommend the idols of his home
   domain or force them on the subjugated people. Usually they would
   meekly follow. People had become accustomed to such transitions. If you
   now remember that Islam does not completely reject Christ but honours
   Him above all prophets except Muhammad, then you can understand how an
   exhausted Eastern Christian community could succumb more easily than
   would Western Christians of 1907. After all the quarreling over
   scholastic dogmatic questions into which the Christians of that time
   entrapped themselves, Islam presented itself as a simple, sensually
   pleasing and steadfast religion. The prayers were all prescribed. All
   behaviour in family and society was guided by clearly defined laws. In
   spite of these laws, many questionable types of behaviour were allowed
   to pass; there was freedom and latitude so that they could continue to
   observe many marginal practices from their own traditions. The spider
   of Islam only gradually spun its web around the fly, but once the fly
   was in its web, it would slowly be totally enveloped. That new spirit
   would impress itself on his heart so that it would rule his entire life
   and he slowly develop into a Muslim, heart and soul, bone and marrow.

   Nevertheless, it remains a mystery how the higher Christian religion in
   all these countries could give up so helplessly in such a short time
   that it was reduced to a mere residue. But though under the rule of God
   this almost total disappearance of the Eastern Church remains a dark
   spot, there are also a few light beams that help us somewhat understand
   and that should temper our judgement over the lack of faithfulness of
   those Christians. Their divisions broke their back; the mass
   conversions to Christ under the political influence of emperors was
   more illusory than real [italics by translator]; the superior power of
   Islam was imposing; their social humiliation wore down all resistance;
   Islam pleased the instincts of the sensual and lust for power; the
   superiority of Islam in its high scholarly developments soon became
   nearly irresistible. Islam put itself in line with the Christian
   tradition and replaced it with a form of religion that was simple in
   its conceptions, gave solid norms for life and was powerfully
   disseminated in nation after nation through the conviction of its
   adherents. Even today (1907) we can observe in Africa and in our own
   Dutch Archipelago of Indonesia how Islam, once it has entered a nation,
   tends to spread spontaneously and gradually until it has captured the
   spirit of the nation as a whole.

Muslim Tenacity Versus Political Disintegration

   The tenacity with which Islam has held its own for almost fourteen
   centuries and continues to do so is just as important as the great
   speed with which it spread. The period of its scholarly climax is past.
   Everything open to exploration and conclusions was explored and
   concluded. It was the Sunnis, especially the Hanifites among them, who
   managed to imprint their system and insights as the orthodoxy on Islam
   to its fullest extent. Scholarship turned into defense of tradition;
   their schools largely lost their earlier relevance; their art
   collapsed-- but the spirit of Islam continued to govern the emotions
   with undiminished fervor. Western unbelief penetrated the educated
   elite in the cities. Their attending European schools and, no less
   critical, their visiting Paris lead in many cases to a change in
   spirit. The Young Turks and the young Egyptians even dream of a
   revolution that will separate state and religion. They want to leave
   the religion of the people as is but reshape Government into the mould
   of Western constitutionality. These modern concepts are a mere drop of
   oil on the water. The ordinary masses of people have not changed and
   hold tenaciously on to their tradition. In fact, it would take very
   little to have the flame of the old fanaticism suddenly arise again.
   This happened repeatedly during the last decades in Egypt, where the
   European influence was especially advocated by Mehemet Ali.

   Islam has definitely weakened. As disunity once broke the back of
   Christians, so has it also caused the radiance of Islam to grow pale.
   Even the Caliphate has split time and again. And what especially
   attacked the nerve of Islam's power is that the unity of Islam as a
   ruling world power was broken. Islam was no longer one single world
   power; ruler attacked ruler. To be sure, the Turks restored that
   powerful unity for a considerable time. With the exception of Persia,
   India and Central Asia, they managed to reunite almost all the Muslim
   people. Even Eastern Europe was threatened with recapture. But after
   the battle of Lepanto in 1571 this unity was once again broken up. Even
   though the Sultan of Turkey commands a well disciplined army of more
   than half a million soldiers, after Turkey lost marine supremacy, a
   process that started at Lepanto and was completed at Navarino, the
   Sultan could no longer exert his authority beyond his narrow borders.
   No power can maintain itself around the Mediterranean Sea unless it
   controls that Sea itself. The Carthaginians perished when their navy
   was defeated during the Punic Wars with Rome near Mylae and Ecnomus in
   263-265 B.C., just as even earlier the Persians were defeated by the
   Greeks after the battle of Salamis in 480 B.C. Again as the defeat of
   Antonius in 31 B.C. at Actium led to his demise, so did defeat of the
   Turks at Lepanto and Navarino lead to their downfall. The land route is
   simply too long to rule the distant regions of such an empire. And
   since the United Kingdom became master of the Mediterranean Sea after
   the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, the Sultan does not have sufficient
   means to resist the pressure that is constantly exerted on him and to
   which he must constantly succumb. Thereto must be added the
   consideration that the Muslim is basically a warrior at heart and lacks
   the capacity for effective administration. Conqueror by birth, he has
   been deprived of the special qualities needed for civil administration.
   Even though Islam always reserved its most capable for the higher
   positions, the Turkish government depended mostly on the Greeks and
   Armenians and, in Egypt, on the Coptics for financial and general
   administration as well as for the lower ranks in diplomacy. These
   distorted relationships caused welfare to reduce, trade to shrink and
   the country to be impoverished, so that financial crises presented
   themselves repeatedly.

   But none of these developments could disturb the Muslim community in
   the depth of its soul. Throughout the length and breadth of the entire
   Muslim world the spirit of the people remained unflinched. Their entire
   territory everywhere is still fully Muslim. In spite of its tolerance
   for national traditions, its patience with the residue of previous
   religions, its recognition of native customary law, it always remained
   faithful to Allah and His Prophet.

The Contemporary State of Islam

   The population of Islamic regions has not greatly increased. Many wars
   have taken their toll. Infant mortality was high. A variety of
   epidemics reaped tens of thousands of souls. At one time, Sudan had a
   population of over eight million, but because of the Mahdi war and a
   terrible measles epidemic, now (1907) has no more than two million.
   Nevertheless, Wagner estimates the total Muslim world population in the
   year 1900 to be no less than 245 million. That amounts to 15.4 percent
   of the total world population. This mass of people just sits there as
   an unmovable block as Islam steadily spreads further in India, in
   Indonesia and, especially, in Africa. Others present us with different
   statistics. Exact figures are not really available. The lowest numbers
   available give us 145 million for mainland Asia, 50 million for Africa,
   almost 12 million for Europe and almost 30 million for Indonesia and a
   few other islands.

   Among all the Muslim nations, Persia has adopted the most independent
   position but also the most isolated one, by which it weakened the power
   of Islam rather than strengthened it. Of its over nine million
   inhabitants, only two million belong to the Sunni sect, while the
   remainder follow the Shi'ites. From the beginning, Persia chose a
   hereditary monarchical government over against the democratic ideals of
   the Arabs. Therefore, they rejected the elected Caliphs Abubakar,
   Uthman and Omar and stood behind Ali, who should have succeeded
   Muhammad according to hereditary rights. In fact, they pushed their
   support for Ali so far that they attributed a divine incarnation to
   him, a notion that he himself declined but that nevertheless took
   increasing root among them. By this break with orthodox Islam, the high
   sense of nationalism that still characterizes Persia maintained itself,
   while the Arian spirit, that never allowed itself to be fully erased,
   sought to survive through philosophical contemplation and pantheistic
   speculation. This was the reason for the rise of new sects, among which
   some even replaced Muhammad with Ali. Not the least among these new
   sects were the Sufis and, in the nineteenth century, the Baha'i faith,
   which gained adherents in all circles. Voltaire's spirit was also
   welcome in Persia, as seen among the Baha'i. It led to increasing
   estrangement between the official state religion and the spirit of the
   people. In some isolated areas one still finds some Guebres or fire
   worshippers and in one remote corner a remnant of the ancient Christian
   church, but the dominant atmosphere is provided by philosophy and
   poetry. So little support for Islam can be expected from Persia, that
   it is constantly at loggerheads with Turkey and tends to draw more of
   its inspiration from Western Europe. In this sense, Islam never
   conquered the Persian spirit so that the official Shi'a rule, even more
   today than previously, exists more in name than in actuality.

   Five million Muslims live in Aghanistan. In the cities, they speak
   mostly Farsi (Persian) and are Shi'ites. But in the rural areas they
   hold on to their Afghani language and consider themselves Sunnis, with
   the exception of the Shi'ite Khazars. However, this country is too much
   of a buffer state between British and Russian interests to have any
   significance for Muslim power. Spiritual life hardly exists there,
   while it is unable to follow an independent political agenda.

   Then we have at a still much lower level the country of Balutchistan
   with less than a million inhabitants. They claim to be Sunni, but they
   are so wild and uncivilized that they have as an expression, "Anyone
   who has not murdered a neighbour and seduced his wife is not a real
   Baluchi." It hardly needs saying that this country carries no weight in
   the scale of Muslim power.

   Persia separates these lands too far from Turkey, while an alliance
   with India is too difficult to motivate both Afghanistan and
   Balutchistan to do anything for Islam beyond serving as an isolated and
   superfluous reserve. That especially in Afghanistan the spirit of Islam
   still motivates a few individuals powerfully, is demonstrated by Jamal
   ad-Din al-Afghani, whose attempts at reformation at the University of
   Al-Azhar were even amenable to the movement of Arabi Pasha. But such
   were totally isolated phenomena that had little following among the
   people.

   The situation is totally different when you cross the Himalayas into
   India, where the Muslims are not less than 63 million in number and
   thus make the United Kingdom, India's colonial ruler, the largest
   Muslim power. Muslims first entered India from Ghazni, an Afghani
   province, some three centuries after the Hijira, i.e., around the year
   1,000 A.D. They remained in the northwest without making much progress
   initially. It was not till the middle of the seventeenth century that
   Aurangzeb, one of the great Moghul kings, who did not hesitate to use
   violence, exerted powerful propaganda and thus initiated the spread of
   Islam over a wide area. The Hindu caste system favoured conversions.
   The oppressed and despised untouchables were powerfully attracted to
   the position of equality that Islam offered. This process is still
   going on. The greatest concentration of Muslims is found in Punjabi.
   They also have a powerful presence in a part of Bengal, that was split
   in two to please Muslims. The rest live mainly in the coastal cities,
   where they maintain contact with Arab marine traffic from across the
   water.

   The vast majority of Indian Muslims are Sunnis of the Hanifite school.
   There is also movement of sects from Persia, while the Hindus who
   convert to Islam continue to cling to many features of their former
   religion. Still, on the whole, Indian Islam is of an orthodox
   character. The Sultan of Turkey is acknowledged as the legitimate head
   of Islam. The atmosphere is increasingly open to mystical influences of
   the spiritual orders. Even in the area of scholarship new life is
   beginning to stir among them. They surpass the Hindus in courage,
   resilience and pride, while in the moral sphere they have shown
   themselves to be carriers of a higher culture. Because of their growing
   numbers and increasing influence, the British government increasingly
   favours them. All indications are that Muslims in British India will
   assert themselves more than they have in the past.

   At first glance, the Islam of Indonesia appears to be of far greater
   significance in so far as it has been adopted by almost the entire
   community, especially on the main island of Java. The number of Muslims
   in Indonesia is about half of those in India. On the island of Sumatra
   it is sharply delineated, but this is not the case to the same degree
   on Java. Here much of the traditional religion with its many traditions
   and local customs lives on in the shadow of the crescent. The character
   of the Javanese is much less fanatic.

   During recent years even here a more decisive tone has penetrated from
   Al-Azhar University. Sometimes the pilgrimage to Mecca produces
   fanaticism. Arab immigrants goad them into action. In these so-called
   dependencies, Muslim propaganda goes on relentlessly but mostly under
   the radar. The Netherlands government must thus keep a watchful eye on
   the situation, for the strength of the more than 30 million Muslims who
   find their home in this Archipelago can be ignored only at the expense
   of Dutch power. [33] Pan-Islam has its secret agents everywhere, while
   Constantinople is also interested in every aspect of this island
   nation.

   The number of Muslims under Russian control in southern Russia, the
   Caucasus and in Central Asia is smaller but by no means insignificant.
   Statistical data put the number of the combined adherents of Islam
   under the authority of the Czar at well over seventeen million--eight
   million in Europe and the Caucasus, and a good nine million in Central
   Asia. Quite a few have left the Caucasus for Turkey, but the unique way
   in which Russia treats its Muslims soon put a stop to this exodus. The
   government does not touch their religion. It grants them every freedom
   to conduct their social life according to their own tradition. It
   operates a strong regime to maintain peace and order. It establishes
   schools for Muslims and has even given them their own Sheikh-ul-Islam
   who, as their own spiritual leader, keeps them from developing close
   relations with Constantinople. The extreme manner in which the
   authority of the Czar was originally established has cultivated
   resignation with respect to their subjugation. While Russia continued
   in a state of war with its Jewish population, it managed to establish
   complete supremacy over its Muslims, especially after the destruction
   of the Tscherkessen people, so that there is little to be concerned
   about from that side. Also the balance of the Slavic colonization in
   Central Asia is changing so that the preponderance of Muslims in those
   regions is gradually reducing.

   In China, the number of Muslims is estimated at over twenty-three
   million. Some authorities even estimate thirty-three million. They
   already started penetrating here in the eighth century. It is said that
   Khalif Abu Giefer sent 4000 Arabs to China to help the ruling dynasty
   against a rebellious population. [34] For this reason, the emperors
   have had special regard for Muslims and even entrusted them with high
   posts and honours. The community increased by marrying Chinese women
   and by buying up children, which they then would bring up as Muslims.
   [35] But it was exactly this privileged position of theirs, combined
   with their excessive pride of character and sense of moral superiority,
   that tempted them often to armed resistance. In the province of Yunnan
   and neighbouring areas where they were greatest in number, a civil war
   broke out between them and the indigenous Chinese in 1855 over a mine
   dispute that was squashed by imperial troops with unprecedented
   cruelty. This was not altogether undeserved, for Maheen, the leader of
   the rebels, boasted that he personally had killed no less than a
   million Chinese! In 1877, a new rebellion broke out under Yakub Bey.
   This was repeated in Chinese Turkestan, while simultaneously numerous
   Muslims joined the Boxers. However, the Chinese government managed
   every time to retain control over their territories. Even though
   Muslims constitute little more than five percent of the population and
   have adopted much of the dominant religion and customs in order to find
   acceptance, they nevertheless represent a power that must be taken into
   account in China. We will likely hear more about them in the future.
   [36]

   Outside of Russia and the Turkish Empire, the number of Muslims in
   Europe is negligible. In Bosnia and Herzogovenia that are currently
   Austrian protectorates, as in Bulgaria, Muslims are little more than
   half million strong. In addition, a hundred thousand live in Romania,
   Greece, Servia and Montenegro. But even if you add European Turkey to
   all this, this would give all of Europe, apart from Russia, no more
   than three million. In European Turkey, the figure hardly surpasses two
   million. But Turkey as a whole remains an Islamic superpower for two
   reasons. First, it is the seat of the Sultan. Second, it is the only
   independent power of considerable significance because of its extensive
   territory, the size of its population and the availability of a
   significant army. We may as well disregard the nominal sovereignty of
   the Sultan over Egypt, but even then, taking everything together,
   including Tripoli, Turkey still has a Muslim population of two million
   in Europe, controls well over fourteen million in Asia and one and a
   quarter million in Africa. Put together, a total of eighteen million
   along with a military force that, together with a reserve, amounts to
   about one million. Of course, this is a low number compared to the
   total figure of 245 million Muslims over the entire world, but Turkey
   is and remains the historic continuation of the original Muslim world
   power. The Islamic world as a whole wants the Sultan to continue to
   serve as sovereign, but within Turkey the original power of the
   Khalifate has been transferred to the Turkish Government, for it alone
   knew how to maintain it all. This is the reason that almost all Muslims
   look upon Turkey as the actual world centre for Islam. In almost every
   mosque prayers are offered for the Sultan of Turkey. Even in Egypt the
   national party backs Turkey.

   However, new pockets of resistance are constantly emerging from Arabia,
   usually from the Wahabis, that receive their strength from the
   traditional Arab resentment of the Mongols. But now that the railway
   line from Damascus to Medina is near completion, the chances of the
   Sultan to retain control over this area by the rapid transportation of
   troops are greatly increased. The difficulties always arise from
   independent tribes in Arabia that even now still form a power of over
   three million, but the main thing is that the Sultan will not allow
   Mecca to slip out of his hands and that the Upper Sherif remains
   faithful to him. For this reason, the Turkish government strongly
   encourages the construction of railways. It is very aware that nothing
   is more effective for the maintenance of her supremacy over such a wide
   area. Whoever has access to well-trained troops and an extensive
   railway system can easily retain control over such a wide area,
   especially when the people are deeply divided and lack all national
   cohesion, even if other conditions are unfavourable.

   It remains to be seen whether the railway system will not cause an
   internal weakening of Islam by encouraging the penetration of a foreign
   higher culture. At this point, it can only be said that in Egypt, where
   the influence of Western culture has penetrated the farthest, already
   since the time of Mehemet Ali, and even more after the establishment of
   British rule, one detects few traces of a radical change in the hearts
   of the people. In Algeria and Tunisia the experience is the same.
   Morocco with its population of eight to nine million people is totally
   independent in spirit. The Sultan there, who boasts of being a
   descendant of Muhammad's family, is an independent Khalif and has no
   relations with Turkey as a political power or with the Sultan of
   Turkey. Nevertheless, this country remains Muslim through and through.
   The contempt for death that the tribes from the interior exhibited
   against the French troops around Casablanca demonstrated clearly that
   here also the spirit of Islam is still capable of generating a fanatic
   defiance. The Islamic fire is far from extinguished.

   Islam along the coast of Africa and in its interior is, with the
   exception of Tripoli, almost totally under European control. This is
   important on two counts. First, because at the moment Islam exerts its
   strongest propaganda in Africa and, second, the African continent is
   beginning to count more and more in world affairs. Of its population of
   170 million, almost 60 million have already converted to Islam, among
   them the 24 million of the northern coastal states, including Egypt,
   while the rest live in the interior and along the east coast. All the
   attempts since the sixteenth century to convert the Sub-Saharan Black
   peoples to Christianity have failed, while Muslims, who penetrated deep
   into the interior, succeeded to win one ethnic group after another
   without meeting strong resistance anywhere. [37] The Sahara and Sudan
   have as good as been won over; the propaganda among the Bantu peoples
   from central Africa, the Zulus and other Black populations has already
   been started with great energy. If it is not possible to stem this tide
   by putting up a dam, [38] then it can be foreseen that the day is
   coming that, with the exception of Ethiopia, Madagascar and the British
   colonies in South Africa, this entire continent will fall into the lap
   of Islam. [39] We should not lose sight of the fact that all these
   newly-won lands border on each other, so that, if the above scenario is
   realized, eventually this entire contiguous land mass from the
   Mediterranean to Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) with its population close to 100
   million, will belong to Islam. In Asia, Muslim groups exist in isolated
   pockets among other large world religions. In Africa, to the contrary,
   one huge mass of intermingled peoples will hold the banner of Islam
   high. No matter how divided they may be among European colonies, they
   will find their unity in Islam. Blacks once converted, regardless of
   their current status, become brothers to the adherents of the religion
   to which they convert. The enthusiasm displayed in the Sudanese Mahdi
   uprisings indicates that Africa is susceptible to strong religious
   upheavals.

   There is no need to make special mention about the small group of
   Muslims in Siam (Thailand), Indochina and a few Portuguese and Spanish
   possessions. Their total number probably does not exceed three million.
   What is important to realize about the power of Islam is that of the
   245 million Muslims more than 180 million are under European control;
   only 65 million are independent. Great Britain leads the pack with 72
   million. China is next with its 33 million, after which follow The
   Netherlands with 30 million, France with 22 million and Russia with 17
   million. The statistics for the other European countries are
   negligible: Germany, two and a half million; Italy, one and a half; the
   rest, from half a million down to a few thousand. The largest groups of
   Muslims are under European sovereignty--Great Britain, The Netherlands
   and France--and number a total of 135 million and thus constitute more
   than half of the entire world Muslim population.

   Leaving aside its government, I doubt that the people of my own
   country, The Netherlands, are conscious of this fact. They do not give
   much thought to Islam. Certainly, the Dutch missionary movement is not
   sufficiently aware of the kind of battle with which it needs to
   approach Islam. From the scholarship point of view, we can hold our
   heads high. We have several missionaries of international repute, such
   as Veth, Dozy, De Goeje, Snouck Hurgronje and Houtsma, but our people
   do not pay attention and fail to sense the significance of the problem
   with which Islam confronts little The Netherlands. Hence the Dutch
   missionary thrust in Indonesia lacks the necessary persistence and the
   specific kind of approach that is necessary for all missions to Islam.

   From the above data about the distribution of Muslim power in Asia and
   Africa, it is clear that Islam does not constitute a serious political
   challenge. Islam, more than any other worldview, demands unity of
   spiritual and political power, but only one quarter of the total Muslim
   community in the world live under Muslim sovereignty. Turkey is
   supposed to represent the unified power of Islam, but the Sultan has
   only a little over 18 million subjects that probably cannot all be
   considered Muslims. That is such a tiny fraction of the whole that the
   unity of spiritual and political power really does not exist anywhere.
   When only a quarter of all Muslims live under Muslim sovereignty and
   even that one quarter is so bitterly divided that the power of the
   Sultan extends to little over one third of that one quarter, Islam is
   not only doomed as a political power but is also undermined in its
   foundations. Islam requires that Muslims rule other nations. That, in
   fact, is their privilege and calling. But they themselves may not be
   subjected to foreign rule. Where the latter does happen, Muslims will
   patiently accept the situation temporarily, but deep in its soul Islam
   will eventually come to resist it and constantly look forward to the
   glorious day that it will regain its freedom and restore its own
   sovereignty. [40] Islam depends for such a turn of events on
   supernatural help, because it fully realizes its military weakness.
   Even Turkey, in the absence of a navy, is in no position to buttress
   its claims with any authority. Everywhere, Muslims have had the painful
   experience that their fierce heroism and fanatic devotion are no match
   for modern European weaponry.

   Pan-Islam was born out of this awareness of Muslim political and
   military powerlessness, combined with their unimpaired faith and
   relentless heroism. Every now and then some independent Mahdi would
   attempt to hasten that day of victory, but, while these morning stars
   would emerge with sudden speed, they would invariably with equal speed
   sink back into oblivion. The consciousness that this Mahdi route was
   not the way to restore the prestige of Islam grew deeper and deeper.
   Islam became powerless through its scattered constellation; only the
   revival of spiritual unity could promise better days.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [33] I find it striking that Kuyper seems to accept the colonial status
   without any qualms, while my published critique of colonialism is the
   product of the Kuyperian worldview (See J. Boer, 1979, throughout).

   [34] Translator's note: I could not find anything about Khalif Abu
   Giefar to confirm this history. However, I did find the following quote
   about the incident: "An Lu-shan, a favorite of Emperor Hsuan Tsung,
   rebelled against the T'ang Dynasty. Of mixed Sogdian and Turkish
   descent, the enormously fat An Lu-shan, a skilled military commander
   and governor of three provinces, led an uprising in 755 after Hsuan
   Tsung abdicated in favor of Su Tsung. When An Lu-shan captured and
   occupied Ch'ang-an, Su Tsung, apparently influenced by the Muslim
   success at the Battle of Talas, wrote to A-p'u ch'a-fo - rather a good
   rendition of the Arabic name of the second Abbasid caliph Abu Ja'far
   al-Mansur - asking him to send troops to help him recapture Ch'ang-an.
   The caliph responded by sending 4,000 men - who did help Su Tsung
   retake the capital, but who also settled in China, took Chinese wives
   and, in effect, established the first Muslim community in China"
   (Chinahistoryforum.com).

   [35] These and similar or parallel practices are still common among
   Muslims in various countries even today in the 21st century. (J. Boer,
   vol. 7, 2008, pp. 61-62, 155, 161-162.)

   [36] Kuyper's prediction came true. A century later, during the very
   months this article is being translated (July-September, 2009), the
   struggle has again revived and is indeed again in the news.

   [37] Kuyper clearly was not familiar with the situation in the region
   that the British turned into Northern Nigeria. Here Traditionalist
   ethnic groups throughout the nineteenth century resisted this Muslim
   encroachment. Their resistance lost its force only under British
   colonialists who, under the "Pax Britannica," in many ways favoured
   Islam at the expense of Traditionalists, one of the ways being the
   imposition of Muslim emirs on Traditionalist-Christian tribes. What
   Muslims could not achieve on their own during the nineteenth century
   was given to them on a silver platter by the British during the
   twentieth. (J. H. Boer, 1979, pp. 71-74, 101, 141-143, 211-213,
   500-506; 1984, pp. 60-63; 2004, vol. 3, pp. 86-88, 203-204, 214,
   286-287; 2005, pp. 101-102; 2008, pp. 194, 286-287, Appendices 8-10--p.
   422.

   [38] The idea of a "mission wall" was, perhaps unbeknown to Kuyper,
   already close to a century old. Allow me to cite a paragraph from my
   1979 dissertation. "Already in the 1820s men began to dream about an
   Apostle Street,' a route that was yet to be determined, along which
   would enter the King of Glory. A station was to be established every
   100 miles along the route for the spread of the Gospel. This idea was
   adapted later by the German missionary Krapf, who devised a complete
   plan for an east-west chain of stations. He envisioned a total distance
   of some 2700 miles that would be divided into sections of 300 miles,
   each with its own station manned by four missionaries. The entire cost
   would be between L4,000 to L5,000 annually. The project was to be
   called the Equatorial Mission Chain' and it was to be completed within
   a dozen years" (p. 101).

   [39] That was, in fact, a consuming fear of the Western missionary
   movement of the day to the point of it being a missionary crisis that
   was felt throughout the ecumenical church. The milestone Edinburgh
   Missionary Conference of 1910 spoke of "the most critical missionary
   problem in Africa" (J. H. Boer, 1979, pp. 101-102). Here Kuyper had his
   finger on the missionary pulse of his day. It is perhaps unfair to have
   expected these missionaries and Kuyper to have foreseen the tremendous
   explosion of the African church, especially since independence. Today,
   in Nigeria, the most populous African nation, Muslims find themselves
   confronted with a Christian community equal in number, some 65 million
   of each! There are entire African countries that consider themselves
   "Christian."

   [40] Italics by translator. Translator's note: Wanting to rule over
   other nations is, of course, not unique to Muslims. It is called
   imperialism, a disease that has long afflicted the West as well. Much
   of the religious, political and cultural revival of Islam at the end of
   the 20th century is in reaction to Western imperialism over them.
   Kuyper foresaw this scenario already in his own day.
     __________________________________________________________________

Pan-Islam, Spiritual Orders and Revivalism

   That spiritual unity was still a potent factor. The Shi'ites counted
   few adherents, while other smaller sects were of no significance, but
   the large majority still stood firm in the orthodoxy of the Sunni
   faith. Even the struggle between the four major schools was basically
   decided in favour of the Hanifites almost everywhere. This spiritual
   unity was a reality. It only needed to be re-energized with new life to
   revive the consciousness of unity.

   This task was taken on by the spiritual orders. As their adherents
   gradually increased in number, they impressed the masses with their
   superior morality. Islam provided them with fixed forms for living and
   for communal worship, forms that were observed almost everywhere.
   However, these forms were too external, did not touch the heart, and
   could not inspire them enough. It was the spiritual orders that were to
   cultivate this spirituality of the heart. They spread their tentacles
   in short time throughout the Muslim community.

   Initially, the Turkish Government did not favour this movement. She saw
   danger lurking in the attempt to replace the unity provided by the
   Turkish regime with another higher type of unity. The Muftis and Ulama
   also were jealous of a movement that threatened to supercede the
   external worship service by a deeper spiritual disposition, whose
   source was to be found not in the mosque but in the monastery. This
   opposition had its parallel in the Christian Church where the
   established clergy resisted free mystical fellowships. However, over
   time the opposition petered out. The Sultan correctly observed that,
   provided his spiritual Caliphate was left untouched, eventually the
   fruit of this movement would fall into his lap. The plan of the
   reforming party to appoint the Sherif of Mecca pope of Islam would
   undermine the Sultan's authority, but this new movement of spiritual
   orders worked in his favour. Hence, he eventually gave it his blessing.

   Attempts to equate this Pan-Islam movement with the Pan-Slavic and
   Pan-German movements are definitely misguided. These latter movements
   derive their strength from a racial base and are associated with
   nationalism. Pan-Islam, on the other hand, is based exclusively on the
   religious motif. Every time Muslims play the racist card, as happened
   between the Turks and Arabs, Islam loses terrain, for such issues are
   not core to Islam. [41] Outside of Persia and Egypt, Islam has no
   nationalist impulses and even in Arabia, where such movements
   constantly arise, it is always based on the primacy of the spiritual.
   Arab Islam, more than any other, is regarded by Arabs as their own.
   They especially long for Islam in its original purity and they are
   deeply troubled by the fact that a Mongul tribe has taken over the
   Caliphate. But even though nationalism plays a role here, the spiritual
   factor provides even here the leitmotif. In Arabia the Crescent comes
   first and only after the Arab banner. Pan-Islam found its origin in the
   painful manner in which the great powers of Christian Europe imposed
   their superior power upon the Muslim states and tribes. [42] An
   awareness arose that all of Islam was endangered, that its disunity,
   its dampened and petrified faith, condemned Islam to powerlessness.

   It was high time for Islam to pursue three things if it were to
   maintain any position of power at all. First, the band of unity of all
   who raise the Crescent high had to be restored. Secondly, Islam had to
   be purified of all the foreign accretions that had crept in. Thirdly,
   the withered faith must be re-animated with a fresh enthusiasm. That
   this three-fold urgency was indeed the badly needed response to the
   situation on the ground was demonstrated by the surprising speed with
   which Pan-Islam took hold. Already it had its interpreters and
   supporters throughout the Muslim world, from Hyderabad in Pakistan to
   Tangier and Fes in Morocco. It was as if Muslims had been waiting for
   just such a movement and as if the sun of Pan-Islam had only to rise
   over the horizon for them to embrace it with enthusiasm. It had more
   the dynamics of a sudden fire than of the organization of an artificial
   movement. Yet, it did not lack all organization, even though some
   scholars attributed disproportionate weight to it. Abu Al-Huda, a
   sheikh of the Rafai order,* leads the movement from Constantinople,
   while the Great Sherif of Mecca, a member of this powerful order, has
   the consummate skills to utilize the pilgrimage to the Ka'aba as
   propaganda for this communal movement. It has even succeeded to unite
   different orders under a degree of administrative unity through the
   person of Sheikh El-Troeg.* Under the powerful leadership of this
   administrator, throngs of missionaries penetrated Asia and Africa to
   declare an Islamic revival. Sheikh Jafer, head of the Tripoli-based
   Madaniya order, has a powerful influence as court chaplain to the
   Sultan, and leads the movement in North Africa. This artificial
   dispersion of Pan-Islam is by no means insignificant, but it would be
   far too weak to reach its goal if the general consciousness of a
   European threat were not found in all Muslim countries. It is only out
   of necessity that Islam tolerates foreign domination, especially now
   that even the land of the Sultan is losing province after province and
   the Sultan himself has to submit constantly in his own country to the
   demands of Western powers. In the meantime, resentment builds up and
   people ask themselves whether Islam with its more than fifteen percent
   of the population of the world, should not be able to muster the power
   to put an end to this foreign oppression. Politically speaking, the
   goal of Pan-Islam is undoubtedly the return of all Muslims under the
   rule of the Sultan, but this goal is only the last step on a long
   journey.

   For the moment, the main agenda is two-fold. First, Islam must purify
   itself from the accretions it has absorbed from the earlier religions
   of the people it has absorbed. Secondly, it must raise the general
   awareness that all who live under the Crescent must wake up and work
   towards unification in preparation for a new gigantic struggle. Often
   the movement expresses itself in minor explosions of fanaticism, but
   these are suppressed too quickly to make a lasting impression. It is
   realized that this phase of the action must first be completed with
   limitless patience and spiritual tenacity, if the end goal is ever to
   be reached. That is why there is a heavy emphasis on sending out
   agents, on the distribution of literature and the continuation of the
   ongoing triumphal march among Africa's Blacks.

   Undoubtedly, this never-ceasing propaganda has already considerably
   strengthened the position of Islam. The foreign rulers in India and
   Pakistan, in Indonesia and Africa are forced increasingly to take the
   sensitivities of Islam into consideration. Sirdar Kitchener was even
   forced to strongly forbid all Christian mission activities in Egyptian
   Sudan. [43] In India and Pakistan the British Viceroy tried to make
   more and more contact with Muslims. The French Government in Tunis
   approached Islam very differently from what it did earlier in Algeria.
   In Egypt the British tried to avoid anything that might annoy Muslims.

   [41] Translator's note: There are plenty more examples of Muslim
   racism. In Mauritania, the relations between Berbers and Blacks are
   bedeviled by racism. When I talk to North African and Asian Muslims
   about Nigerian Muslims, they invariably shrug their shoulders with
   indifference for their Black Nigerian counterparts. In Nigeria itself
   racism is rife between the northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani and their
   neighbours. As in Christianity, the standard is one thing; the
   practice, another.

   provocation of Islam through the centuries as an important factor in
   the current tension between Islam and the West. And then, of course,
   factor this into their response to the challenge they are facing. It
   does not appear that Kuyper took this second step. He merely observed
   the first.

Muslim Reactions towards the West and Missions

   At the beginning of this document I described the high speed with which
   Islam had not only established its military superiority in Asia and
   Africa, but also succeeded in capturing the hearts of the people into
   the net of Islam. This still portrays the power over the spirit that
   emanates from Islam. And if we remember that Pan-Islam succeeded in
   inspiring its 245 million adherents with this ancient religious
   zealotry, then it is impossible to predict what power can emanate from
   it in the future. It is not as if the military superiority of Western
   powers would not be able to crush all forms of resistance, but this
   would only be due to technical power. Military superiority does not
   break spiritual resistance, but, rather, tends to strengthen it.
   Neither must we put much hope in the widespread expectation that our
   higher culture will eventually tame the spirit of Islam. Muslim
   populations are very adept at profiting from the fruits of our higher
   civilization that we introduce or from the improvements in
   administration and judiciary that lead to the elevated welfare of the
   nations, but this is all external to the heart. Furthermore, these
   developments only serve to tempt a small group to fall away, become
   indifferent to the faith and replace it with atheism. But this does not
   touch the masses. They continue in their unchanging traditional life
   and remain Muslim in their hearts. And even among the elite the motto,
   "For Muhammad and against Christ," retains its attraction.

   In another chapter in this series of mine I told the story of a highly
   placed and fully modernized woman who declared she would thoroughly
   enjoy beheading all Christian missionaries. I now add the story of a
   highly regarded man who could hardly pass a British sentry without
   feeling a deep desire welling up to wring his neck with his own hands.
   With our railways, our irrigation systems, our advanced administration
   and our industrial enterprises we can improve the economic situation of
   Muslim countries, but we do not win over the people with such
   improvements. Muslims everywhere to a man will bless the day they see
   us leave and they are searching for ways to make this happen.

   There is only one means to win over the people, namely if we could get
   the masses motivated to trade in their religion for Christianity, but
   for this there is not a chance. Since long, Christian missions have
   concentrated their efforts on toughest of all countries, namely those
   of the Sultan. First, the French. After them, the Italians and the
   Greeks. Still later, British and American missions competed with each
   other for the crown of victory with unusual resilience and warm zeal
   for the faith, but the only fruit they could show for their efforts
   consists exclusively of encouraging the Christian remnants still found
   in scattered places in Turkey. Without these extensive missionary
   efforts, these remnants would most likely have been wholly absorbed
   into Islam. Now, however, they do not only still exist, thanks to their
   expansive school systems, but they have been upgraded to a new level of
   Christian life. But everywhere the number of converts from Islam were
   few and, when placed in the context of the entire nation, hardly worthy
   of mention. They did lure Muslim youth to their schools and the Muslim
   sick to their hospitals. They also contributed to the development of
   the community, but they could not win the hearts of the people
   anywhere.

   Similarly, in Dutch Indonesia, where Islam has a much more superficial
   character, all missions testify to the extreme difficulty of changing
   the hearts of the people. I leave aside the question whether missions
   understood the people adequately or whether they had the requisite
   skills. Dutch missionaries treated the indigenous Indonesian Christian
   missionary, Kyai Sadrach, who preached a unique kind of Javanese
   Christianity, with great impatience. While admitting that missions have
   made serious mistakes, the result of their work in Muslim countries is
   so disappointing and painfully sad, that only self-deceit can still
   harbour hope that there is a chance for the conversion of Muslims on a
   large scale. [44] Rather, we must acknowledge that the Pan-Islamic
   revival has further considerably reduced the chances of Christian
   victory among Muslims. Certainly, during the last half century in Dutch
   Indonesia, Islam has gained many more converts from the Traditionalist
   tribes on Java and a few other islands than have Christians.

   This is the experience of missions everywhere. For the Muslim to
   convert to Christianity is from their point of view to descend to a
   lower level. Islam came after Christ. Islam has a later and higher
   revelation. Who wants to go back from the latest and highest to an
   earlier and lower? A convert from Islam is a traitor in the eyes of
   Muslims. As far as Muslims are concerned, such a person has died
   morally and the entire Muslim neighbourhood works together towards his
   reversion under the weight of contempt and of social deprivation.

   Added to the above is the problem that we tend to bring Christianity to
   the East in an almost exclusively Western format, while the Easterner,
   not feeling comfortable with that format, is much more attracted to the
   Eastern format of Islam. Islam with its Eastern format is better
   oriented to his needs and speaks to him, while Christianity with its
   Western format feels repugnant. The end result is that Christian
   missions usually plow on rocks and gain very few people, while Islam
   continues its victorious march in both Indonesia and Africa. Islam
   hardly loses any people, except in Persia, where it is weakened by
   internal instability. But as a world power, Islam continues to grow
   steadily. Even during the centuries of its cultural heyday, the number
   of Muslims was smaller than it is now. Sometimes Islam exerts such an
   irresistible charm or temptation to baptized Christians, that we
   repeatedly hear of Christians who have denied the Cross and converted
   to Islam.

   Islam flatters the tendency in the human heart to pride and
   sensuousness. It is clear, simple and easily understood in its major
   lines and fixed forms. It not only shapes your religious life, but also
   governs the totality of the rest of your life. It is capable of
   adapting itself to a wide range of circumstances. It allows a high
   degree of freedom of movement. [45] During its first cycle, Islam
   proved amenable to high scholarly development and had at its disposal a
   very rich body of literature. To the eye of the fanatic it holds up a
   sparkling ideal of might and greatness that can still inflame the
   deepest passions. So I have no more expectation from Christian
   subjugation of Islam than I do from the technical and economic aspects
   of the West. Even now the wheels are in motion to develop a higher
   culture in India that will match the highest cultural developments of
   Christian Europe.

   I am fully aware that it is emotionally very hard for us Christians to
   acknowledge this development. Even if Islam endlessly echoes the call
   to Allah, the All-Merciful and the All-Compassionate, in its mosques
   and from its minarets, this call does not emerge from a deep
   consciousness of sin or from a thirst for reconciliation. Allah is and
   remains for Muslims a mighty Sovereign who regards His faithful
   servants with grace and favour. But Islam does not know of a Father in
   heaven who comes to His children with the invitation to be reconciled
   to Him. In Islam, the Almighty exercises mercy, but there is no Holy
   One who overcomes our internal separation through reconciliation.
   Therefore the ideal of a Holy Loving God must be totally lacking, even
   in Allah Himself. [46]

   Thus, we must accept the fact that this mighty group of Muslims that
   stretches all the way across Asia and Africa, blocks the way of
   Christianity and of our higher culture. Islam itself represents a
   culture that is much higher than the Paganism it replaced and that did
   indeed develop a higher culture from the seventh to thirteenth
   centuries. However, today it has consolidated its achievements at an
   intermediary level that resists every attempt to climb to higher
   ideals.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [44] Translator's note: Nigeria always seems different from most other
   nations. Kuyper would have been surprised at the great number of Muslim
   converts to Christ in Nigeria during the last half of the twentieth
   century. I personally know many of them. The churches there have every
   reason for optimism in this regard. Some Christian leaders, including
   the late Haruna Dandaura, who was highly respected by Muslim leaders,
   claim that the number of Northern converts runs into the millions (J.
   Boer, 2008, pp. 179-182).

   [45] This claim may surprise readers of the 21st century who are
   accustomed to hearing or reading the media about rigid Muslim arguments
   regarding a strict sharia, strict fashions, strict everything. Kuyper
   observed Islam during a more relaxed period, when it was more its
   normal self. It is in the current crisis that everything grey has been
   turned into black and white and everything fluid into rigid forms.

   [46] To make such absolute claims about another religion is very
   dangerous. My extensive reading of and research in Nigerian Muslim
   literature has made me very cautious not to make absolutist claims or
   denials about the Muslim experience of Allah on basis of logical
   conclusions from Muslim doctrine. The following paragraphs are
   similarly weakened by absolutist claims. Whenever Muslims draw logical
   conclusions from some Christian doctrine, I never recognize myself in
   their conclusion, for it is usually based on a distorted or partial
   version of a doctrine taken out of context. Do Christians understand
   Islam more than the other way around? Are they not liable to similar
   errors? At the very least, we should usually avoid words like "all,"
   "every," "never," "always" and "totally" when talking about other
   religions, especially in critical comments.
     __________________________________________________________________

Muslim Morality

   Islam is a religion for men; women look in from the outside. In
   contrast to France, where church attendance consists almost exclusively
   of women, in Islam, women hardly play any role in their worship
   services. Islam totally lacks female input to social life and culture.
   Isabelle Bird-Bishop had the opportunity to penetrate deeply into the
   life of Muslim women. She witnessed the indescribable in the presence
   of young harem girls. She could only comment that it would be
   impossible for anything more demonic, dirty and demeaning to be called
   up in the polluted imagination of a sick man than was displayed before
   the eyes of women and young girls or said in their presence. Another
   lady, Mrs. Stanley Pool-Lane, testifies that during the course of
   succeeding generations, life in harems gradually sank so low that it
   would be impossible to sink to a lower level of brutality and
   animalism. [47]

   Undoubtedly, this almost exclusively male character gives Islam its
   strength. It enables Islam to retain its position in higher circles.
   But the total lack of female influence means Islam is bereft of that
   tenderness and warmth that women contribute so generously to the
   Christian religion. The Muslim, according to ancient Bedouin tradition,
   is hospitable and protective of strangers. He is famous for his
   charitable treatment of the poor. However, Tenney, in his recent book
   Contrasts of Social Progress, comments that everything done in
   Constantinople for the poor and needy, through voluntary gifts and
   foundations, is not even close to one tenth of the philanthropy
   practiced in London. The Muslim is honest in his commerce and traffic
   and shines here compared to Greeks and Armenians, not to speak of Asian
   Jews, but this honesty is rooted more in his pride than in his moral
   standard. Provided extremes are avoided, Muslim ethics makes light of
   moderate levels of evil. That is expressed in so many words in Surah 4,
   where we are told that Allah does not demand too much from us, for He
   knows that we are weak. If we keep ourselves from committing the
   offences that are explicitly forbidden, He will overlook your wrongs
   and ensure your entry into Paradise. These sentiments appear to be
   borrowed from the Old Testament, but they are distorted by nomism with
   its rough attack on the ethical ideal. A culture based on such a low
   ethical foundation cannot possibly develop beyond a mediocre level.
   Islam has risen a few rungs up the ethical ladder, but then remained at
   that level and could make no further progress. And even though this
   mediocre culture is often disguised in European dress to appeal to the
   higher classes, in their hearts and in their worldview the spirituality
   inherent to Islam maintains its control. All progressive development is
   cut off. Occasionally, puritan movements arise that protest against
   this legalistic deviation from the Qur'an, but even these revivals
   never aim higher than a return to the ethical standards of the Qur'an.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [47] Today, in the 21st century, Muslims contemptuously dismiss
   primitive Western displays of nudity, scant clothing, every form of
   bestial sex, with prostitution presented as a respectable occupation.
   Sometimes they identify such sub-human practices with Christianity, a
   link Christians would strongly reject. Faithful Muslims similarly
   reject such links and regard such practices as un-Islamic. It is not
   acceptable to compare the best of one religion with the worst practices
   of adherents of another.
     __________________________________________________________________

A Prognosis

   The fact is that Islam's political power has been undermined by
   European superiority. There are no signs of change in this regard.
   However, Islam fully maintains its spiritual power and resists all
   attempts at change at this front. To the contrary, it gained
   consciously in its dynamic energy and, thanks to the movement of
   Pan-Islam, even enjoys gradual expansion. Due to its method of peaceful
   penetration, Islam is left undisturbed to itself, precisely because it
   is realized that internally it is unconquerable. A declaration of holy
   war or jihad could cause a simultaneous bloodbath in different places,
   but it would not be able to return world sovereignty to Islam. But even
   if Islam for the time being has no chance for world dominion, it will
   never let go of this ideal. The earthly character of this ideal has put
   its stamp on all its adherents [48] that can never rise above its
   contradiction with our culture that is marked by a heavenly ideal. This
   core contradiction also blocks any attempt at fusing the two into a
   higher unity. Islam will either remain as it is or it will cease to
   exist. That it has been able to maintain itself with such tenacity for
   over thirteen centuries in spite of unfavourable times, is a testimony
   to its inner dynamic that still moves it. The Crescent is far from its
   demise. As long as it retains its successful rule over the hearts of
   its mass of 245 million people, it will be a bad mistake for anyone to
   dismiss Islam as a negligible factor. As in the past, Islam retains its
   strong position of power, especially in Africa, but even Europe cannot
   afford to ignore it. Do not forget the following remarkable contrast.
   The millions of Christians who came under the rule of the Sultan during
   the seventh and eighth centuries, have almost all converted to Islam.
   To the contrary, Muslims who currently are ruled by Christian powers
   have fully persevered in their faith. [49]

   [18] Kuyper knew the terminology he is using here, but I am not sure he
   understood the relations between them accurately. I have not tried to
   upgrade him here, except that I have inserted in the text brief
   explanations of these Arabic terms so important to Islam.

   [19] I am not sure Islam allows this terminology. It is Kuyper's.

   [20]

   [21] This is a strong statement that I am not sure can stand scrutiny.

   [22] Remember that Kuyper is comparing the two religions a century ago.
   Since then, Christendom has disappeared, secularism has taken over with
   its very loose moral standards that have even affected Christians in
   the 21st century. Had he written this comparison today, he undoubtedly
   would have been more nuanced. Comparing and contrasting today's
   Christian moral standards with those of Islam is tricky. Both will win
   some and loose others.

   [23] Kuyperian thought emphasizes creation ordinances, including moral
   ordinances, that are out there and can be discovered in rough outline
   through experience, but for which fallen man needs the Bible to
   understand them in their full depth.
