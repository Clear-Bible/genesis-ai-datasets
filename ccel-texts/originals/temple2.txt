   The Authour to the Reader.

   BEing desirous (thorow the Mercy of GOD) to please Him, for whom I am,
   and live, and who giveth mee my Desires and Performances; and
   considering with my self, That the way to please him, is to feed my
   Flocke diligently and faithfully, since our Saviour hath made that the
   argument of a Pastour's love, I have resolved to set down the Form and
   Character of a true Pastour, that I may have a Mark to aim at: which
   also I will set as high as I can, since hee shoots higher that
   threatens the Moon, then hee that aims at a Tree. Not that I think, if
   a man do not all which is here expressed, hee presently sinns, and
   displeases God, but that it is a good strife to go as farre as wee can
   in pleasing of him, who hath done so much for us. The Lord prosper the
   intention to my selfe, and others, who may not despise my poor labours,
   but add to those points, which I have observed, untill the Book grow to
   a compleat Pastorall.

   CHAP. I. Of a Pastor.

   A Pastor is the Deputy of Christ for the reducing of Man to the
   Obedience of God. This definition is evident, and containes the direct
   steps of Pastorall Duty and Auctority. For first, Man fell from God by
   disobedience. Secondly, Christ is the glorious instrument of God for
   the revoking of Man. Thirdly, Christ being not to continue on earth,
   but after hee had fulfilled the work of Reconciliation, to be received
   up into heaven, he constituted Deputies in his place, and these are
   Priests. And therefore St. Paul in the beginning of his Epistles,
   professeth this: and in the first [v.24] to the Colossians plainly
   avoucheth, that he fils up that which is behinde of the afflictions of
   Christ in his flesh, for his Bodie's sake, which is the Church. Wherein
   is contained the complete definition of a Minister. Out of this Chartre
   of the Priesthood may be plainly gathered both the Dignity thereof, and
   the Duty: The Dignity, in that a Priest may do that which Christ did,
   and by his auctority, and as his Vicegerent. The Duty, in that a Priest
   is to do that which Christ did, and after his manner, both for Doctrine
   and Life.

   CHAP. II. Their Diversities.

   OF Pastors (intending mine own Nation only, and also therein setting
   aside the Reverend Prelates of the Church, to whom this discourse
   ariseth not) some live in the Universities, some in Noble houses, some
   in Parishes residing on their Cures. Of those that live in the
   Universities, some live there in office, whose rule is that of the
   Apostle; Rom. 12.6. Having gifts differing, according to the grace that
   is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophecy according to the
   proportion of faith; or ministry, let us wait on our ministring, or he
   that teacheth, on teaching, &c. he that ruleth, let him do it with
   diligence, &c. Some in a preparatory way, whose aim and labour must be
   not only to get knowledge, but to subdue and mortifie all lusts and
   affections: and not to think, that when they have read the Fathers, or
   Schoolmen, a Minister is made, and the thing done. The greatest and
   hardest preparation is within: For, Unto the ungodly, saith God, Why
   dost thou preach my Laws, and takest my Covenant in thy mouth? Psal.
   50.16. Those that live in Noble Houses are called Chaplains, whose duty
   and obligation being the same to the Houses they live in, as a Parsons
   to his Parish, in describing the one (which is indeed the bent of my
   Discourse) the other will be manifest. Let not Chaplains think
   themselves so free, as many of them do, and because they have different
   Names, think their Office different. Doubtlesse they are Parsons of the
   families they live in, and are entertained to that end, either by an
   open, or implicite Covenant. Before they are in Orders, they may be
   received for Companions, or discoursers; but after a man is once
   Minister, he cannot agree to come into any house, where he shall not
   exercise what he is, unlesse he forsake his plough, and look back.
   Wherfore they are not to be over-submissive, and base, but to keep up
   with the Lord and Lady of the house, and to preserve a boldness with
   them and all, even so farre as reproofe to their very face, when
   occasion cals, but seasonably and discreetly. They who do not thus,
   while they remember their earthly Lord, do much forget their heavenly;
   they wrong the Priesthood, neglect their duty, and shall be so farre
   from that which they seek with their over-submissivenesse, and
   cringings, that they shall ever be despised. They who for the hope of
   promotion neglect any necessary admonition, or reproofe, Sell (with
   Judas) their Lord and Master.

   CHAP. III. The Parsons Life.

   THe Countrey Parson is exceeding exact in his Life, being holy, just,
   prudent, temperate, bold, grave in all his wayes. And because the two
   highest points of Life, wherein a Christian is most seen, are Patience,
   and Mortification; Patience in regard of afflictions, Mortification in
   regard of lusts and affections, and the stupifying and deading of all
   the clamorous powers of the soul, therefore he hath throughly studied
   these, that he may be an absolute Master and commander of himself, for
   all the purposes which God hath ordained him. Yet in these points he
   labours most in those things which are most apt to scandalize his
   Parish. And first, because Countrey people live hardly, and therefore
   as feeling their own sweat, and consequently knowing the price of mony,
   are offended much with any, who by hard usage increase their travell,
   the Countrey Parson is very circumspect in avoiding all coveteousnesse,
   neither being greedy to get, nor nigardly to keep, nor troubled to lose
   any worldly wealth; but in all his words and actions slighting, and
   disesteeming it, even to a wondring, that the world should so much
   value wealth, which in the day of wrath hath not one dramme of comfort
   for us. Secondly, because Luxury is a very visible sinne, the Parson is
   very carefull to avoid all the kinds thereof, but especially that of
   drinking, because it is the most popular vice; into which if he come,
   he prostitutes himself both to shame, and sin, and by having
   fellowship, with the unfruitfull works of darknesse, he disableth
   himself of authority to reprove them: For sins make all equall, whom
   they finde together; and then they are worst, who ought to be best.
   Neither is it for the servant of Christ to haunt Innes, or Tavernes, or
   Ale-houses, to the dishonour of his person and office. The Parson doth
   not so, but orders his Life in such a fashion, that when death takes
   him, as the Jewes and Judas did Christ, he may say as He did, I sate
   daily with you teaching in the Temple. Thirdly, because Countrey people
   (as indeed all honest men) do much esteem their word, it being the Life
   of buying, and selling, and dealing in the world; therfore the Parson
   is very strict in keeping his word, though it be to his own hinderance,
   as knowing, that if he be not so, he wil quickly be discovered, and
   disregarded: neither will they beleeve him in the pulpit, whom they
   cannot trust in his Conversation. As for oaths, and apparell, the
   disorders thereof are also very manifest. The Parsons yea is yea, and
   nay nay; and his apparrell plaine, but reverend, and clean, without
   spots, or dust, or smell; the purity of his mind breaking out, and
   dilating it selfe even to his body, cloaths, and habitation.

   CHAP. IIII. The Parsons Knowledg.

   THe Countrey Parson is full of all knowledg. They say, it is an ill
   Mason that refuseth any stone: and there is no knowledg, but, in a
   skilfull hand, serves either positively as it is, or else to illustrate
   some other knowledge. He condescends even to the knowledge of tillage,
   and pastorage, and makes great use of them in teaching, because people
   by what they understand, are best led to what they understand not. But
   the chief and top of his knowledge consists in the book of books, the
   storehouse and magazene of life and comfort, the holy Scriptures. There
   he sucks, and lives. In the Scriptures hee findes four things; Precepts
   for life, Doctrines for knowledge, Examples for illustration, and
   Promises for comfort: These he hath digested severally. But for the
   understanding of these; the means he useth are first, a holy Life,
   remembring what his Master saith) that if any do Gods will, he shall
   know of the Doctrine, John 7[:17]. and assuring himself, that wicked
   men, however learned, do not know the Scriptures, because they feel
   them not, and because they are not understood but with the same Spirit
   that writ them. The second means is prayer, which if it be necessary
   even in temporall things, how much more in things of another world,
   where the well is deep, and we have nothing of our selves to draw with?
   Wherefore he ever begins the reading of the Scripture with some short
   inward ejaculation, as, Lord open mine eyes, that I may see the
   wondrous things of thy Law. &c. The third means is a diligent Collation
   of Scripture with Scripture. For all Truth being consonant to it self,
   and all being penn'd by one and the self-same Spirit, it cannot be, but
   that an industrious, and judicious comparing of place with place must
   be a singular help for the right understanding of the Scriptures. To
   this may be added the consideration of any text with the coherence
   thereof, touching what goes before, and what follows after, as also the
   scope of the Holy Ghost. When the Apostles would have called down fire
   from Heaven, they were reproved, as ignorant of what spirit they were.
   For the Law required one thing, and the Gospel another: yet as diverse,
   not as repugnant: therefore the spirit of both is to be considered, and
   weighed. The fourth means are Commenters and Fathers, who have handled
   the places controverted, which the Parson by no means refuseth. As he
   doth not so study others, as to neglect the grace of God in himself,
   and what the Holy Spirit teacheth him; so doth he assure himself, that
   God in all ages hath had his servants, to whom he hath revealed his
   Truth, as well as to him; and that as one Countrey doth not bear all
   things, that there may be a Commerce; so neither hath God opened, or
   will open all to one, that there may be a traffick in knowledg between
   the servants of God, for the planting both of love, and humility.
   Wherfore he hath one Comment at least upon every book of Scripture, and
   ploughing with this, and his own meditations, he enters into the
   secrets of God treasured in the holy Scripture.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAP. V. The Parsons Accessary Knowledges.

   THe Countrey Parson hath read the Fathers also, and the Schoolmen, and
   the later Writers, or a good proition of all, out of all which he hath
   compiled a book, and body of Divinity, which is the storehouse of his
   Sermons, and which he preacheth all his Life; but diversly clothed,
   illustrated, and inlarged. For though the world is full of such
   composures, yet every mans own is fittest, readyest, and most savory to
   him. Besides, this being to be done in his younger and preparatory
   times, it is an honest joy ever after to looke upon his well spent
   houres. This Body he made by way of expounding the Church Catechisme,
   to which all divinity may easily be reduced. For it being indifferent
   in it selfe to choose any Method, that is best to be chosen, of which
   there is likelyest to be most use. Now Catechizing being a work of
   singular, and admirable benefit to the Church of God, and a thing
   required under Canonicall obedience, the expounding of our Catechisme
   must needs be the most usefull forme. Yet hath the Parson, besides this
   laborious work, a slighter forme of Catechizing, fitter for country
   people; according as his audience is, so he useth one, or other; or
   somtimes both, if his audience be intermixed. He greatly esteemes also
   of cases of conscience, wherein he is much versed. And indeed, herein
   is the greatest ability of a Parson to lead his people exactly in the
   wayes of Truth, so that they neither decline to the right hand, nor to
   the left. Neither let any think this a slight thing. For every one hath
   not digested, when it is a sin to take something for mony lent, or when
   not; when it is a fault to discover anothers fault, or when not; when
   the affections of the soul in desiring and procuring increase of means,
   or honour, be a sin of covetousnes or ambition, and when not, when the
   appetites of the body in eating, drinking, sleep, and the pleasure that
   comes with sleep, be sins of gluttony, drunkenness, sloath, lust, and
   when not, and so in many circumstances of actions. Now if a shepherd
   know not which grass will bane, or which not, how is he fit to be a
   shepherd? Wherefore the Parson hath throughly canvassed al the
   particulars of humane actions, at least all those which he observeth
   are most incident to his Parish.

   CHAP. VI. The Parson praying.

   THe Countrey Parson, when he is to read divine services, composeth
   himselfe to all possible reverence; lifting up his heart and hands, and
   eyes, and using all other gestures which may expresse a hearty, and
   unfeyned devotion. This he doth, first, as being truly touched and
   amazed with the Majesty of God, before whom he then presents himself;
   yet not as himself alone, but as presenting with himself the whole
   Congregation, whose sins he then beares, and brings with his own to the
   heavenly altar to be bathed, and washed in the sacred Laver of Christs
   blood. Secondly, as this is the true reason of his inward feare, so he
   is content to expresse this outwardly to the utmost of his power; that
   being first affected himself, hee may affect also his people, knowing
   that no Sermon moves them so much to a reverence, which they forget
   againe, when they come to pray, as a devout behaviour in the very act
   of praying. Accordingly his voyce is humble, his words treatable, and
   slow; yet not so slow neither, to let the fervency of the supplicant
   hang and dy between speaking, but with a grave livelinesse, between
   fear and zeal, pausing yet pressing, he performes his duty. Besides his
   example, he having often instructed his people how to carry themselves
   in divine service, exacts of them all possible reverence, by no means
   enduring either talking, or sleeping, or gazing, or leaning, or
   halfe-kneeling, or any undutifull behaviour in them, but causing them,
   when they sit, or stand, or kneel, to do all in a strait, and steady
   posture, as attending to what is done in the Church, and every one,
   man, and child, answering aloud both Amen, and all other answers, which
   are on the Clerks and peoples part to answer; which answers also are to
   be done not in a hudling, or slubbering fashion, gaping, or scratching
   the head, or spitting even in he midst of their answer, but gently and
   pausably, thinking what they say; so that while they answer, As it was
   in the beginning, &c. they meditate as they speak, that God hath ever
   had his people, that have glorified him as wel as now, and that he
   shall have so for ever. And the like in other answers. This is that
   which the Apostle cals a reasonable service, Rom. 12 [:1]. when we
   speak not as Parrats, without reason, or offer up such sacrifices as
   they did of old, which was of beasts devoyd of reason; but when we use
   our reason, and apply our powers to the service of him, that gives
   them. If there be any of the gentry or nobility of the Parish, who
   somtimes make it a piece of state not to come at the beginning of
   service with their poor neighbours, but at mid-prayers, both to their
   own loss, and of theirs also who gaze upon them when they come in, and
   neglect the present service of God, he by no means suffers it, but
   after divers gentle admonitions, if they persevere, he causes them to
   be presented: or if the poor Church-wardens be affrighted with their
   greatness, notwithstanding his instruction that they ought not to be
   so, but even to let the world sinke, so they do their duty; he presents
   them himself, only protesting to them, that not any ill will draws him
   to it, but the debt and obligation of his calling, being to obey God
   rather then men.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAP. VII. The Parson preaching.

   THe Countrey Parson preacheth constantly, the pulpit is his joy and his
   throne: if he at any time intermit, it is either for want of health, or
   against some great Festivall, that he may the better celebrate it, or
   for the variety of the hearers, that he may be heard at his returne
   more attentively. When he intermits, he is ever very well supplyed by
   some able man who treads in his steps, and will not throw down what he
   hath built; whom also he intreats to press some point, that he himself
   hath often urged with no great success, that so in the mouth of two or
   three witnesses the truth may be more established. When he preacheth,
   he procures attention by all possible art, both by earnestnesse of
   speech, it being naturall to men to think, that where is much
   earnestness, there is somewhat worth hearing; and by a diligent, and
   busy cast of his eye on his auditors, with letting them know, that he
   observes who marks, and who not; and with particularizing of his speech
   now to the younger sort, then to the elder, now to the poor, and now to
   the rich. This is for you, and This is for you; for particulars ever
   touch, and awake more then generalls. Herein also he serves himselfe of
   the judgements of God, as of those of antient times, so especially of
   the late ones; and those most, which are nearest to his Parish; for
   people are very attentive at such discourses, and think it behoves them
   to be so, when God is so neer them, and even over their heads.
   Sometimes he tells them stories, and sayings of others, according as
   his text invites him; for them also men heed, and remember better then
   exhortations; which though earnest, yet often dy with the Sermon,
   especially with Countrey people; which are thick, and heavy, and hard
   to raise to a poynt of Zeal, and fervency, and need a mountaine of fire
   to kindle them; but stories and sayings they will well remember. He
   often tels them, that Sermons are dangerous things, that none goes out
   of Church as he came in, but either better, or worse; that none is
   careless before his Judg, and that the word of God shal judge us. By
   these and other means the Parson procures attention; but the character
   of his Sermon is Holiness; he is not witty, or learned, or eloquent,
   but Holy. A Character, that Hermogenes [1] never dream'd of, and
   therefore he could give no precepts thereof. But it is gained, first,
   by choosing texts of Devotion, not Controversie, moving and ravishing
   texts, whereof the Scriptures are full. Secondly, by dipping, and
   seasoning all our words and sentences in our hearts, before they come
   into our mouths, truly affecting, and cordially expressing all that we
   say; so that the auditors may plainly perceive that every word is
   hart-deep. Thirdly, by turning often, and making many Apostrophes to
   God, as, Oh Lord blesse my people, and teach them this point; or, Oh my
   Master, on whose errand I come, let me hold my peace, and do thou speak
   thy selfe; for thou art Love, and when thou teachest, all are Scholers.
   Some such irradiations scatteringly in the Sermon, carry great holiness
   in them. The Prophets are admirable in this. So Isa. 64 [:1]. Oh that
   thou would'st rent the Heavens, that thou wouldst come down, &c. And
   Jeremy [2] Chapt. 10 [:23]. after he had complained of the desolation
   of Israel, turnes to God suddenly, Oh Lord, I know that the way of man
   is not in himself, &c. Fourthly, by frequent wishes of the peoples
   good, and joying therein, though he himself were with Saint Paul even
   sacrificed upon the service of their faith. For there is no greater
   sign of holinesse, then the procuring, and rejoycing in anothers good.
   And herein St Paul excelled in all his Epistles. How did he put the
   Romans in all his prayers? Rom.1.9. And ceased not to give thanks for
   the Ephesians, Eph. 1.16. And for the [II] Corinthians, chap. 1.4. And
   for the Philippians made request with joy, ch.1.4. And is in contention
   for them whither to live, or dy; be with them, or Christ, verse 23.
   which, setting aside his care of his Flock, were a madnesse to doubt
   of. What an admirable Epistle is the second to the Corinthians? how
   full of affections? he joyes, and he is sorry, he grieves, and he
   gloryes, never was there such care of a flock expressed, save in the
   great shepherd of the fold, who first shed teares over Jerusalem, and
   afterwards blood. Therefore this care may be learn'd there, and then
   woven into Sermons, which will make them appear exceeding reverend, and
   holy. Lastly, by an often urging of the presence, and majesty of God,
   by these, or such like speeches. Oh let us all take heed what we do,
   God sees us, he sees whether I speak as I ought, or you hear as you
   ought, he sees hearts, as we see faces: he is among us; for if we be
   here, hee must be here, since we are here by him, and without him could
   not be here. Then turning the discourse to his Majesty, And he is a
   great God, and terrible, as great in mercy, so great in judgement:
   There are but two devouring elements, fire, and water, he hath both in
   him; His voyce is as the sound of many waters. Revelations 1 [:15]. And
   he himselfe is a consuming fire, Hebrews 12 [:29]. Such discourses shew
   very Holy. The Parsons Method in handling of a text consists of two
   parts; first, a plain and evident declaration of the meaning of the
   text; and secondly, some choyce Observations drawn out of the whole
   text, as it lyes entire, and unbroken in the Scripture it self. This he
   thinks naturall, and sweet, and grave. Whereas the other way of
   crumbling a text into small parts, as, the Person speaking, or spoken
   to, the subject, and object, and the like, hath neither in it
   sweetnesse, nor gravity, nor variety, since the words apart are not
   Scripture, but a dictionary, and may be considered alike in all the
   Scripture. The Parson exceeds not an hour in preaching, because all
   ages have thought that a competency, and he that profits not in that
   time, will lesse afterwards, the same affection which made him not
   profit before, making him then weary, and so he grows from not
   relishing, to loathing.

   CHAP. VIII. The Parson on Sundays.

   THe Country Parson, as soon as he awakes on Sunday morning, presently
   falls to work. and seems to himselfe so as a Market-man is, when the
   Market day comes, or a shopkeeper, when customers use to come in. His
   thoughts are full of making the best of the day, and contriving it to
   his best gaines. To this end, besides his ordinary prayers, he makes a
   peculiar one for a blessing on the exercises of the day, That nothing
   befall him unworthy of that Majesty before which he is to present
   himself, but that all may be done with reverence to his glory, and with
   edification to his flock, humbly beseeching his Master, that how or
   whenever he punish him, it be not in his Ministry: then he turnes to
   request for his people, that the Lord would be pleased to sanctifie
   them all, that they may come with holy hearts, and awfull mindes into
   the Congregation, and that the good God would pardon all those, who
   come with lesse prepared hearts then they ought. This done, he sets
   himself to the Consideration of the duties of the day, and if there be
   any extraordinary addition to the customary exercises, either from the
   time of the year, or from the State, or from God by a child born, or
   dead, or any other accident, he contrives how and in what manner to
   induce it to the best advantage. Afterwards when the hour calls, with
   his family attending him, he goes to Church, at his first entrance
   humbly adoring, and worshipping the invisible majesty, and presence of
   Almighty God, and blessing the people either openly, or to himselfe.
   Then having read divine Service twice fully, and preached in the
   morning, and catechized in the afternoone, he thinks he hath in some
   measure, according to poor, and fraile man, discharged the publick
   duties of the Congregation. The rest of the day he spends either in
   reconciling neighbours that are at variance, or in visiting the sick,
   or in exhortations to some of his flock by themselves, whom his Sermons
   cannot, or doe not reach. And every one is more awaked, when we come,
   and say, Thou art the man. [3] This way he findes exceeding usefull,
   and winning; and these exhortations he cals his privy purse, even as
   Princes have theirs, besides their publick disbursments. At night he
   thinks it a very fit time, both sutable to the joy of the day, and
   without hinderance to publick duties, either to entertaine some of his
   neighbours, or to be entertained of them, where he takes occasion to
   discourse of such things as are both profitable, and pleasant, and to
   raise up their mindes to apprehend Gods good blessing to our Church,
   and State; that order is kept in the one, and peace in the other,
   without is disturbance, or interruption of publick divine offices. As
   he opened the day with prayer, so he closeth it, humbly beseeching the
   Almighty to pardon and accept our poor services, and to improve them,
   that we may grow therein, and that our feet may be like hindes feet
   ever climbing up higher, and higher unto him.

   CHAP. IX. The Parsons state of Life.

   THe Country Parson considering that virginity is a higher state then
   Matrimony, and that the Ministry requires the best and highest things,
   is rather unmarryed, then marryed. But yet as the temper of his body
   may be, or as thee temper of his Parish may be, where he may have
   occasion to converse with women, and that among suspicious men, and
   other like circumstances considered, he is rather married then
   unmarried. Let him communicate the thing often by prayer unto God, and
   as his grace shall direct him, so let him proceed. If he be unmarried,
   and keepe house, he hath not a woman in his house, but findes
   opportunities of having his meat dress'd and other services done by
   men-servants at home, and his linnen washed abroad. If he be unmarryed,
   and sojourne, he never talkes with any woman alone, but in the audience
   of others, and that seldom, and then also in a serious manner, never
   jestingly or sportfully. He is very circumspect in all companyes, both
   of his behaviour, speech, and very looks, knowing himself to be both
   suspected, and envyed. If he stand steadfast in his heart, having no
   necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his
   heart, that he will keep himself a virgin, he spends his dayes in
   fasting and prayer, and blesseth God for the gift of continency,
   knowing that it can no way be preserved, but only by those means, by
   which at first it was obtained. He therefore thinkes it not enough for
   him to observe the fasting dayes of the Church, and the dayly prayers
   enjoyned him by auctority, which he observeth out of humble conformity,
   and obedience, but adds to them, out of choyce and devotion, some other
   dayes for fasting, and hours for prayers; and by these hee keeps his
   body tame, serviceable, and health- full; and his soul fervent, active,
   young, and lusty as an eagle. He often readeth the Lives of the
   Primitive Monks, Hermits, and Virgins, and wondreth not so much at
   their patient suffering, and cheerfull dying under persecuting
   Emperours, (though that indeed be very admirable) as at their daily
   temperance, abstinence, watchings, and constant prayers, and
   mortifications in the times of peace and prosperity. To put on the
   profound humility, and the exact temperance of our Lord Jesus, with
   other exemplary vertues of that sort, and to keep them on in the
   sunshine, and noone of prosperity, he findeth to be as necessary, and
   as difficult at least, as to be cloathed with perfect patience, and
   Christian fortitude in the cold midnight stormes of persecution and
   adversity. He keepeth his watch and ward, night and day against the
   proper and peculiar temptations of his state of Life, which are
   principally these two Spirituall pride, and Impurity of heart: against
   these ghostly enemies he girdeth up his loynes, keepes the imagination
   from roving, puts on the whole Armour of God, [4] and by the vertue of
   the shield of faith, he is not afraid of the pestilence that walketh in
   darkenesse, [carnall impurity] nor of the sicknesse that destroyeth at
   noone day, [Ghostly pride and self-conceite.] Other temptations he
   hath, which, like mortall enemies, may sometimes disquiet him likewise;
   for the humane soule being bounded, and kept in, in her sensitive
   faculty, will runne out more or lesse in her intellectuall. Originall
   concupisence is such an active thing, by reason of continuall inward,
   or outward temptations, that it is ever attempting, or doing one
   mischief or other. Ambition, or untimely desire of promotion to an
   higher state, or place, under colour of accommodation, or necessary
   provision, is a common temptation to men of any eminency, especially
   being single men. Curiosity in prying into high speculative and
   unprofitable questions, is another great stumbling block to the
   holinesse of Scholars. These and many other spirituall wickednesses in
   high places doth the Parson fear, or experiment, or both; and that much
   more being single, then if. he were marryed; for then commonly the
   stream of temptations is turned another way, into Covetousnesse, Love
   of pleasure, or ease, or the like. If the Parson be unmarryed, and
   means to continue so, he doth at least, as much as hath been said. If
   he be marryed, the choyce of his wife was made rather by his eare, then
   by his eye; his judgement, not his affection found out a fit wife for
   him, whose humble, and liberall disposition he preferred before beauty,
   riches, or honour. He knew that (the good instrument of God to bring
   women to heaven) a wise and loving husband could out of humility,
   produce any speciall grace of faith, patience, meeknesse, love,
   obedience, &c. and out of liberality, make her fruitfull in all good
   works. As hee is just in all things, so is he to his wife also,
   counting nothing so much his owne, as that he may be unjust unto it.
   Therefore he gives her respect both afore her servants, and others, and
   halfe at least of the government of the house, reserving so much of the
   affaires, as serve for a diversion for him; yet never so giving over
   the raines, but that he sometimes looks how things go, demanding an
   account, but not by the way of an account. And this must bee done the
   oftner, or the seldomer, according as hee is satisfied of his Wifes
   discretion.

   CHAP. X. The Parson in his house.

   THe Parson is very exact in the governing of his house, making it a
   copy and modell for his Parish. He knows the temper, and pulse of every
   person in his house, and accordingly either meets with their vices, or
   advanceth theirvertues. His wife is either religious, or night and day
   he is winning her to it. In stead of the qualities of the world, he
   requires onely three of her; first, a trayning up of her children and
   mayds in the fear of God, with prayers, and catechizing, and all
   religious duties. Secondly, a curing, and healing of all wounds and
   sores with her owne hands; which skill either she brought with her, or
   he takes care she shall learn it of some religious neighbour. Thirdly,
   a providing for her family in such sort, as that neither they want a
   competent sustentation, nor her husband be brought in debt. His
   children he first makes Christians, and then Commonwealths-men; the one
   he owes to his heavenly Countrey, the other to his earthly, having no
   title to either, except he do good to both. Therefore having seasoned
   them with all Piety, not only of words in praying, and reading; but in
   actions, in visiting other sick children, and tending their wounds, and
   sending his charity by them to the poor, and somtimes giving them a
   little mony to do it of themselves, that they get a delight in it, and
   enter favour with God, who weighs even childrens actions, I King. 14.
   12, 13. He afterwards turnes his care to fit all their dispositions
   with some calling, not sparing the eldest, but giving him the
   prerogative of his Fathers profession, which happily for his other
   children he is not able to do. Yet in binding them prentices (in case
   he think fit to do so) he takes care not to put them into vain trades,
   and unbefitting the reverence of their Fathers calling, such as are
   tavernes for men, and lace-making for women; because those trades, for
   the most part, serve but the vices and vanities of the world, which he
   is to deny, and not augment. However, he resolves with himself never to
   omit any present good deed of charity, in consideration of providing a
   stock for his children; but assures himselfe, that mony thus lent to
   God, is placed surer for his childrens advantage, then if it were given
   to the Chamber of London. Good deeds, and good breeding, are his two
   great stocks for his children; if God give any thing above those, and
   not spent in them, he blesseth God, and lays it out as he sees cause.
   His servants are all religious, and were it not his duty to have them
   so, it were his profit, for none are so well served, as by religious
   servants, both because they do best, and because what they do, is
   blessed, and prospers. After religion, he teacheth them, that three
   things make a compleate servant, Truth, and Diligence, and Neatnesse,
   or Cleanlinesse. Those that can read, are allowed times for it, and
   those that cannot, are taught; for all in his house are either teachers
   or learners, or both, so that his family is a Schoole of Religion, and
   they all account, that to teach the ignorant is the greatest almes.
   Even the wals are not idle, but something is written, or painted there,
   which may excite the reader to a thought of piety; especially the IoI
   Psalm, which is expressed in a fayre table, as being the rule of a
   family. And when they go abroad, his wife among her neighbours is the
   beginner of good discourses, his children among children, his servants
   among other servants; so that as in the house of those that are skill'd
   in Musick, all are Musicians; so in the house of a Preacher, all are
   preachers. He suffers not a ly or equivocation by any means in his
   house, but counts it the art, and secret of governing to preserve a
   directnesse, and open plainnesse in all things; so that all his house
   knowes, that there is no help for a fault done, but confession. He
   himselfe, or his Wife, takes account of Sermons, and how every one
   profits, comparing this yeer with the last: and besides the common
   prayers of the family, he straitly requires of all to pray by
   themselves before they sleep at night, and stir out in the morning, and
   knows what prayers they say, and till they have learned them, makes
   them kneel by him; esteeming that this private praying is a more
   voluntary act in them, then when they are called to others prayers, and
   that, which when they leave the family, they carry with them. He keeps
   his servants between love, fear, according as hee findes them; but
   generally he distributes it thus, To his Children he shewes more love
   then terrour, to his servants more terrour then love; but an old
   servant boards a child. The furniture of his house is very plain, but
   clean, whole, and sweet, as sweet as his garden can make; for he hath
   no mony for such things, charity being his only perfume, which deserves
   cost when he can spare it. His fare is plain, and common, but wholsome,
   what hee hath, is little, but very good; it consisteth most of mutton,
   beefe, and veal, if he addes any thing for a great day, or a stranger,
   his garden or orchard supplies it, or his barne, and back-side: he goes
   no further for any entertainment, lest he goe into the world, esteeming
   it absurd, that he should exceed, who teacheth others temperance. But
   those which his home produceth, he refuseth not, as coming cheap, and
   easie, and arising from the improvement of things, which otherwise
   would be lost. Wherein he admires and imitates the wonderfull
   providence and thrift of the great householder of the world: for there
   being two things, which as they are, are unuseful to man, the one for
   smalnesse, as crums, and scattered corn, and the like; the other for
   the foulnesse, as wash, and durt, and things thereinto fallen; God hath
   provided Creatures for both: for the first. Poultry; for the second,
   swine. These save man the labour, and doing that which either he could
   not do, or was not fit for him to do, by taking both sorts of food into
   them, do as it were dresse and prepare both for man in themselves, by
   growing them selves fit for his table. The Parson in his house oserves
   fasting dayes; and particularly, as Sunday is his day of joy, so Friday
   his day of Humiliation, which he celebrates only with abstinence of
   diet, but also of company, recreation, and all outward contentments;
   and besides, with confession of sins, and all acts of Mortification.
   Now fasting dayes containe a treble obligation; first, of eating lesse
   that day, then on other dayes; secondly, of eating no pleasing, or
   over-nourishing things, as the Israelites did eate sowre herbs:
   Thirdly, of eating no flesh, which is but the determination of the
   second rule by Authority to this particular. The two former obligations
   are much more essentiall to a true fast, then the third and last; and
   fasting dayes were fully performed by keeping of the two former, had
   not Authority interposed: so that to eat little, and that unpleasant,
   is the naturall rule of fasting, although it be flesh. For since
   fasting in Scripture language is an afflicting of our souls, if a peece
   of dry flesh at my table be more unpleasant to me, then some fish
   there, certainly to eat the flesh, and not the fish, is to keep the
   fasting day naturally. And it is observable, that the prohibiting of
   flesh came from hot Countreys, where both flesh alone, and much more
   with wine, is apt to nourish more then in cold regions, and where flesh
   may be much better spared, and with more safety then elsewhere, where
   both the people and the drink being cold and flegmatick, the eating of
   flesh is an antidote to both. For it is certaine, that a weak stomack
   being prepossessed with flesh, shall much better brooke and bear a
   draught of beer, then if it had taken before either fish, or rootes, or
   such things; which will discover it selfe by spitting, and rheume, or
   flegme. To conclude, the Parson, if he be in full health, keeps the
   three obligations, eating fish, or roots, and that for quantity little,
   for quality unpleasant. If his body be weak and obstructed, as most
   Students are, he cannot keep the last obligation, nor suffer others in
   his house that are so, to keep it; but only the two former, which also
   in diseases of exinanition (as consumptions) must be broken: For meat
   was made for man, not man for meat. To all this may be added, not for
   emboldening the unruly, but for the comfort of the weak, that not onely
   sicknesse breaks these obligations of fasting, but sicklinesse also.
   For it is as unnatural to do any thing, that leads me to a sicknesse,
   to which I am inclined, as not to get out of that sicknesse, when I am
   in it, by any diet. One thing is evident, that an English body, and a
   Students body, are two great obstructed vessels, and there is nothing
   that is food, and not phisick, which doth lesse obstruct, then flesh
   moderately taken; as being immoderately taken, it is exceeding
   obstructive. And obstructions are the cause of most diseases.

   CHAP. XI. The Parson's Courtesie.

   THe Countrey Parson owing a debt of Charity to the poor, and of
   Courtesie to his other parishioners, he so distinguisheth, that he
   keeps his money for the poor, and his table for those that are above
   Alms. Not but that the poor are welcome also to his table, whom he
   sometimes purposely takes home with him, setting them close by him, and
   carving for them, both for his own humility, and their comfort, who are
   much cheered with such friendliness. But since both is to be done, the
   better sort invited, and meaner relieved, he chooseth rather to give
   the poor money, which they can better employ to their own advantage,
   and sutably to their needs, then so much given in meat at dinner.
   Having then invited some of his Parish, hee taketh his times to do the
   like to the rest; so that in the compasse of the year, hee hath them
   all with him, because countrey people are very observant of such
   things, and will not be perswaded, but being not invited, they are
   hated. Which perswasion the Parson by all means avoyds, knowing that
   where there are such conceits, there is no room for his doctrine to
   enter. Yet doth hee oftenest invite those, whom hee sees take best
   courses, that so both they may be encouraged to persevere, and others
   spurred to do well, that they may enjoy the like courtesie. For though
   he desire, that all should live well, and vertuously, not for any
   reward of his, but for vertues sake; yet that will not be so: and
   therefore as God, although we should love him onely for his own sake,
   yet out of his infinite pity hath set forth heaven for a reward to draw
   men to Piety, and is content, if at least so, they will become good: So
   the Countrey Parson, who is a diligent observer, and tracker of Gods
   wayes, sets up as many encouragements to goodnesse as he can, both in
   honour, and profit, and fame; that he may, if not the best way, yet any
   way, make his Parish good.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAP. XII. The Parson's Charity.

   THe Countrey Parson is full of Charity; it is his pre- dominant
   element. For many and wonderfull things are spoken of thee, thou great
   Vertue. To Charity is given the covering of sins, I Pet. 4. 8. and the
   forgivenesse of sins, Matthew 6. 14. Luke 7. 47. The fulfilling of the
   Law, Romans 13. 10. The life of faith, James l. 26. The blessings of
   this life, Proverbs 22. 9. Psalm 41. 2. And the reward of the next,
   Matth. 25. 35. In brief, it is the body of Religion, John 13. 35. And
   the top of Christian vertues, I Corin. 13. Wherefore all his works
   rellish of Charity. When he riseth in the morning, he bethinketh
   himseife what good deeds he can do that day, and presently doth them;
   counting that day lost, wherein he hath not exercised his Charity. He
   first considers his own Parish, and takes care, that there be not a
   begger, or idle person in his Parish, but that all bee in a competent
   way of getting their living. This he effects either by bounty, or
   perswasion, or by authority, making use of that excellent statute,
   which bindes all Parishes to maintaine their own. If his Parish be
   rich, he exacts this of them; if poor, and he able, he easeth them
   therein. But he gives no set pension to any; for this in time will lose
   the name and effect of Charity with the poor people, though not with
   God: for then they will reckon upon it, as on a debt; and if it be
   taken away, though justly, they will murmur, and repine as much, as he
   that is disseized of his own inheritance. But the Parson having a
   double aime, and making a hook of his Charity, causeth them still to
   depend on him; and so by continuall, and fresh bounties, unexpected to
   them, but resolved to himself, hee wins them to praise God more, to
   live more religiously, and to take more paines in their vocation, as
   not knowing when they shal be relieved; which otherwise they would
   reckon upon, and turn to idlenesse. Besides this generall provision, he
   hath other times of opening his hand; as at great Festivals, and
   Communions; not suffering any that day that hee receives, to want a
   good meal suting to thejoy of the occasion. But specially, at hard
   times, and dearths, the even parts his Living, and life among them,
   giving some corn outright, and selling other at under rates; and when
   his own stock serves not, working those that are able to the same
   charity, still pressing it in the pulpit, and out of the pulpit, and
   never leaving them, till he obtaine his desire. Yet in all his Charity,
   he distinguisheth, giving them most, who live best, and take most
   paines, and are most charged: So is his charity in effect a Sermon.
   After the consideration of his own Parish, he inlargeth himself, if he
   be able, to the neighbour-hood; for that also is some kind of
   obligation; so doth he also to those at his door, whom God puts in his
   way, and makes his neighbours. But these he helps not without some
   testimony, except the evidence of the misery bring testimony with it.
   For though these testimonies also may be falsifyed, yet considering
   that the Law allows these in case they be true, but allows by no means
   to give without testimony, as he obeys Authority in the one, so that
   being once satisfied, he allows his Charity some blindnesse in the
   other; especially, since of the two commands, we are more injoyned to
   be charitable, then wise. But evident miseries have a naturall
   priviledge, and exemption from all law. When-ever hee gives any thing,
   and sees them labour in thanking of him, he exacts of them to let him
   alone, and say rather, God be praised, God be glorified; that so the
   thanks may go the right way, and thither onely, where they are onely
   due. So doth hee also before giving make them say their Prayers first,
   or the Creed, and ten Commandments, and as he finds them perfect,
   rewards them the more. For other givings are lay, and secular, but this
   is to give like a Priest.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAP. XIII. The Parson's Church.

   THe Countrey Parson hath a speciall care of his Church, that all things
   there be decent, and befitting his Name by which it is called.
   Therefore first he takes order, that all things be in good repair; as
   walls plaistered, windows glazed, floore paved, seats whole, firm, and
   uniform, especially that the Pulpit, and Desk, and Communion Table, and
   Font be as they ought, for those great duties that are performed in
   them. Secondly, that the Church be swept, and kept cleane without dust,
   or Cobwebs, and at great festivalls strawed, and stuck with boughs, and
   perfumed with incense. Thirdly, That there be fit, and proper texts of
   Scripture every where painted, and that all the painting be grave, and
   reverend, not with light colours, or foolish anticks. Fourthly, That
   all the books appointed by Authority be there, and those not torne, or
   fouled, but whole and clean, and well bound; and that there be a
   fitting, and sightly Communion Cloth of fine linnen, with an handsome,
   and seemly Carpet of good and costly Stuffe, or Cloth, and all kept
   sweet and clean, in a strong and decent chest, with a Chalice, and
   Cover, and a Stoop, or Flagon; and a Bason for Almes and offerings;
   besides which, he hath a Poor-mans Box conveniently seated, to receive
   the charity of well minded people, and to lay up treasure for the sick
   and needy. And all this he doth, not as out of necessity, or as putting
   a holiness in the things, but as desiring to keep the middle way
   between superstition, and slovenlinesse, and as following the Apostles
   two great and admirable Rules in things of this nature: The first
   whereof is, Let all things be done decently, and in order: [I Cor.
   14:40]The second, Let all things be done to edification, I Cor. 14
   [:26]. For these two rules comprize and include the double object of
   our duty, God, and our neighbour; the first being for the honour of
   God; the second for the benefit of our neighbor. So that they
   excellently score out the way, and fully, and exactly contain, even in
   externall and indifferent things, what course is to be taken; and put
   them to great shame, who deny the Scripture to be perfect.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAP. XIV. The Parson in Circuit.

   THe Countrey Parson upon the afternoons in the week- days, takes
   occasion sometimes to visite in person, now one quarter of his Parish,
   now another. For there he shall find his flock most naturally as they
   are, wallowing in the midst of their affairs: whereas on Sundays it is
   easie for them to compose themselves to order, which they put on as
   their holy-day cloathes, and come to Church in frame, but commonly the
   next day put off both. When he comes to anyhouse, first he blesseth it,
   and then as hee finds the persons of the house imployed, so he formes
   his discourse. Those that he findes religiously imployed, hee both
   commends them much, and furthers them when hee is gone, in their
   imployment; as if hee findes them reading, hee furnisheththem with good
   books; if curing poor people, hee supplies them with Receipts, and
   instructs them further in that skill, shewing them how acceptable such
   works are to God, and wishing them ever to do the Cures with their own
   hands, and not to put them over to servants. Those that he finds busie
   in the works of their calling, he commendeth them also: for it is a
   good and just thing for every one to do their own busines. But then he
   admonisheth them of two things; first, that they dive not too deep into
   worldly affairs, plunging themselves over head and eares into carking,
   and caring; but that they so labour, as neither to labour anxiously,
   nor distrustfully, nor profanely. Then they labour anxiously, when they
   overdo it, to the loss of their quiet, and health: then distrustfully,
   when they doubt Gods providence, think- ing that their own labour is
   the cause of their thriving, as if itwere in their own hands to thrive,
   or not to thrive. Then they labour profanely, when they set themselves
   to work like brute beasts, never raising their thoughts to God, nor
   sanctifying their labour with daily prayer; when on the Lords day they
   do unnecessary servile work, or in time of divine service on other holy
   days, except in the cases of extreme poverty, and in the seasons of
   Seed-time, and Harvest. Secondly, he adviseth them so to labour for
   wealth and maintenance, as that they make not that the end of their
   labour, but that they may have wherewithall to serve God the better,
   and to do good deeds. After these discourses, if they be poor and
   needy, whom he thus finds labouring, he gives them somewhat; and opens
   not only his mouth, but his purse to their relief, that so they go on
   more cheerfully in their vocation, and himself be ever the more welcome
   to them. Those that the Parson findes idle, or ill imployed, he chides
   not at first, for that were neither civill, nor profitable; but always
   in the close, before he departs from them: yet in this he
   distinguisheth; for if he be a plaine countryman, he reproves him
   plainly; for they are not sensible of finenesse: if they be of higher
   quality, they commonly are quick, and sensible, and very tender of
   reproof: and therefore he lays his discourse so, that he comes to the
   point very leasurely, and oftentimes, as Nathan did, in the person of
   another, making them to reprove themselves. However, one way or other,
   he ever reproves them, that he may keep himself pure, and not be
   intangled in others sinnes. Neither in this doth he forbear, though
   there be company by: for as when the offence is particular, and against
   mee, I am to follow our Saviours rule, and to take my brother aside,
   and reprove him; so when the offence is publicke, and against God, I am
   then to follow the Apostles rule, I Timothy 5. 20. and to rebuke openly
   that which is done openly. Besides these occasionall discourses, the
   Parson questions what order is kept in the house, as about prayers
   morning and evening on their knees, reading of Scripture, catechizing,
   singing of Psalms at their work, and on holy days; who can read, who
   not; and sometimes he hears the children read himselfe, and blesseth
   them, encouraging also the servants to learn to read, and offering to
   have them taught on holy-dayes by his servants. If the Parson were
   ashamed of particularizing in these things, hee were not fit to be a
   Parson: but he holds the Rule, that Nothing is little in Gods service:
   If it once have the honour of that Name, it grows great instantly.
   Wherfore neither disdaineth he to enter into the poorest Cottage,
   though he even creep into it, and though it smell never so lothsomly.
   For both God is there also, and those for whom God dyed: and so much
   the rather doth he so, as his accesse to the poor is more comfortable,
   then to the rich; and in regard of himseife, it is more humiliation.
   These are the Parsons generall aims in his Circuit; but with these he
   mingles other discourses for conversation sake, and to make his higher
   purposes slip the more easily.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAP. XV. The Parson Comforting.

   THe Countrey Parson, when any of his cure is sick, or afflicted with
   losse of friend, or estate, or any ways distressed, fails not to afford
   his best comforts, and rather goes to them, then sends for the
   afflicted, though they can, and otherwise ought to come to him. To this
   end he hath throughly digested all the points of consolation, as having
   continuall use of them, such as are from Gods generall providence
   extended even to lillyes; from his particular, to his Church; from his
   promises, from the examples of all Saints, that ever were; from Christ
   himself, perfecting our Redemption no other way, then by sorrow; from
   the Benefit of affliction, which softens, and works the stubborn heart
   of man; from the certainty both of deliverance, and reward, if we faint
   not; from the miserable comparison of the moment of griefs here with
   the weight of joyes hereafter. Besides this, in his visiting the sick,
   or otherwise afflicted, he followeth the Churches counsell, namely, in
   perswading them to particular confession, labouring to make them
   understand the great good use of this antient and pious ordinance, and
   how necessary it is in some cases: he also urgeth them to do some pious
   charitable works , as a necessary evidence and fruit of their faith, at
   that time especially: the participation of the holy Sacrament, how
   comfortable, and Soveraigne a Medicine it is to all sin-sick souls;
   what strength, and joy, and peace it administers against all
   temptations, even to death it selfe, he plainly, and generally
   intimateth to the disaffected, or sick person, that so the hunger and
   thirst after it may come rather from themselves, then from his
   perswasion.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAP. XVI. The Parson a Father.

   THe Countrey Parson is not only a father to his flock, but also
   professeth himselfe throughly of the opinion, carrying it about with
   him as fully, as if he had begot his whole Parish. And of this he makes
   great use. For by this means, when any sinns, he hateth him not as an
   officer, but pityes him as a Father: and even in those wrongs which
   either in tithing, or otherwise are done to his owne person, hee
   considers the offender as a child, and forgives, so hee may have any
   signe of amendment; so also when after many admonitions, any continue
   to be refractory, yet hee gives him not over, but is long before hee
   proceede to disinheriting, or perhaps never goes so far; knowing, that
   some are called at the eleventh houre, and therefore hee still expects,
   and waits, least hee should determine Gods houre of coming; which as
   hee cannot, touching the last day, so neither touching the intermediate
   days of Conversion.

   CHAP. XVII. The Parson in Journey.

   THe Countrey Parson, when a just occasion calleth him out of his Parish
   (which he diligently, and strictly weigheth, his Parish being all his
   joy, and thought) leaveth not his Ministry behind him; but is himselfe
   where ever he is. Therefore those he meets on the way he blesseth
   audibly, and with those he overtakes or that overtake him, hee begins
   good discourses, such as may edify, interposing sometimes some short,
   and honest refreshments, which may make his other discourses more
   welcome, and lesse tedious. And when he comes to his Inn, he refuseth
   not to joyne, that he may enlarge the glory of God, to the company he
   is in, by a due blessing of God for their safe arrival, and saying
   grace at meat and at going to bed by giving the Host notice, that he
   will have prayers in the hall, wishing him to informe his guests
   thereof, that if any be willing to partake, they may resort thither.
   The like he doth in the morning, using pleasantly the outlandish
   proverb, that Prayers and Provender never hinder journey. When he comes
   to any other house, where his kindred, or other relations give him any
   authority over the Family, if hee be to stay for a time, hee considers
   diligently the state thereof to Godward, and that in two points: First,
   what disorders there are either in Apparell, or Diet, or too open a
   Buttery, or reading vain books, or swearing, or breeding up children to
   no Calling, but in idleness, or the like. Secondly, what means of
   Piety, whether daily prayers be used, Grace, reading of Scriptures, and
   other good books, how Sundayes, holy-days, and fasting days are kept.
   And accordingly, as he finds any defect in these, hee first
   considerswith himseife, what kind of remedy fits the temper of the
   house best, and then hee faithfully, and boldly applyeth it; yet
   seasonably, and discreetly, by taking aside the Lord or Lady, or Master
   and Mistres of the house, and shewing them cleerly, that they respect
   them most, who wish them best, and that not a desire to meddle with
   others affairs, but the earnestnesse to do all the good he can, moves
   him to say thus and thus.

   CHAP. XVIII. The Parson in Sentinell.

   THe Countrey Parson, where ever he is, keeps Gods watch; that is, there
   is nothing spoken, or done in the Company where he is, but comes under
   his Test and censure: If it be well spoken, or done, he takes occasion
   to commend, and enlarge it; if ill, he presently lays hold of it, least
   the poyson steal into some young and unwary spirits, and possesse them
   even before they themselves heed it. But this he doth discretely, with
   mollifying, and suppling words; This was not so well said, as it might
   have been forborn; We cannot allow this: or else if the thing will
   admit interpretation; Your meaning is not thus, but thus; or, So farr
   indeed what you say is true, and well said; but this will not stand.
   This is called keeping Gods watch, when the baits which the enemy lays
   in company, are discovered and avoyded: This is to be on Gods side, and
   be true to his party. Besides, if he perceive in company any discourse
   tending to ill, either by the wickedness or quarrelsomnesse thereof, he
   either prevents it judiciously, or breaks it off seasonably by some
   diversion. Wherein a pleasantness of disposition is of great use, men
   being willing to sell the interest, and ingagement of their discourses
   for no price sooner, then that of mirth; whither the nature of man,
   loving refreshment, gladly betakes it selfe, even to the losse of
   honour.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAP. XIX. The Parson in reference.

   THe Countrey Parson is sincere and upright in all his relations. And
   first, he is just to his Countrey; as when he is set at an armour, or
   horse, he borrowes them not to serve the turne, nor provides slight,
   and unusefull, but such as are every way fitting to do his Countrey
   true and laudable service, when occasion requires. To do otherwise, is
   deceit; and therefore not for him, who is hearty, and true in all his
   wayes, as being the servant of him, in whom there was no guile.
   Likewise in any other Countrey-duty, he considers what is the end of
   any Command, and then he suits things faithfully according to that end.
   Secondly, he carryes himself very respectively, as to all the Fathers
   of the Church, so especially to his Diocesan, honouring him both in
   word, and behaviour, and resorting unto him in any difficulty, either
   in his studies or in his Parish. He observes Visitations, and being
   there, makes due use of them, as of Clergy councels, for the benefit of
   the Diocese. And therefore before he comes, having observed some
   defects in the Ministry, he then either in Sermon, if he preach, or at
   some other time of the day, propounds among his Brethren what were
   fitting to be done. Thirdly, he keeps good Correspondence with all the
   neighbouring Pastours round about him, performing for them any
   Ministeriall office, which is not to the prejudice of his own Parish.
   Likewise he welcomes to his house any Minister, how poor or mean
   soever, with as joyfull a countenance, as if he were to entertain some
   great Lord. Fourthly, he fulfills the duty, and debt of neighbourhood
   to all the Parishes which are neer him. For the Apostles rule Philip.
   4.[8] being admirable, and large, that we should do whatsoever things
   are honest, or just, or pure, or lovely, or of good report, if there be
   any vertue, or any praise, and Neighbourhood being ever reputed, even
   among the Heathen, as an obligation to do good, rather then to those
   that are further, where things are otherwise equall, therefore he
   satisfies this duty also. Especily, if God have sent any calamity
   either by fire, or famine, to any neighbouring Parish, then he expects
   no Briefe; but taking his Parish together the next Sunday, or holy-day,
   and exposing to them the uncertainty of humane affairs, none knowing
   whose turne may be next, and then when he hath affrighted them with
   this, exposing the obligation of Charity, and Neighbour-hood, he first
   gives himself liberally, and then incites them to give; making together
   a summe either to be sent, or, which were more comfortable, all
   together choosing some fitt day to carry it themselves, and cheere the
   Afflicted. So, if any neighbouring village be overburdened with poore,
   and his owne lesse charged, hee findes some way of releeving it, and
   reducing the Manna, and bread of Charity to some equality, representing
   to his people, that the Blessing of God to them ought to make them the
   more charitable, and not the lesse, lest he cast their neighbours
   poverty on them also.

   CHAP. XX. The Parson in Gods stead.

   THe Countrey Parson is in Gods stead to his Parish, and dischargeth God
   what he can of his promises. Wherefore there is nothing done either wel
   or ill, whereof he is not the rewarder, or punisher. If he chance to
   finde any reading in anothers Bible, he provides him one of his own. If
   he finde another giving a poor man a penny, he gives him a tester for
   it, if the giver be fit to receive it; or if he be of a condition above
   such gifts, he sends him a good book, or easeth him in his Tithes,
   telling him when he hath forgotten it, This I do, because at such, and
   such a time you were charitable. This is in some sort a discharging of
   God; as concerning this life, who hath promised, that Godlinesse shall
   be gainfull: but in the other God is his own immediate paymaster,
   rewarding all good deeds to their full proportion. The Parsons
   punishing of sin and vice, is rather by withdrawing his bounty and
   courtesie from the parties offending, or by private, or publick
   reproof, as the case requires, then by causing them to be presented, or
   otherwise complained of. And yet as the malice of the person, or
   hainousness of the crime may be, he is carefull to see condign
   punishment inflicted, and with truly godly zeal, without hatred to the
   person, hungreth and thirsteth after righteous punishment of
   unrighteousnesse. Thus both in rewarding vertue, and in punishing vice,
   the Parson endeavoureth to be in Gods stead, knowing that Countrey
   people are drawne, or led by sense, more then by faith, by present
   rewards, or punishments, more then by future.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAP. XXI. The Parson Catechizing.

   THe Countrey Parson values Catechizing highly: for there being three
   points of his duty, the one, to infuse a competent knowledge of
   salvation in every one of his Flock; the other, to multiply, and build
   up this knowledge to a spirituall Temple; the third, to inflame this
   knowledge, to presse, and drive it to practice, turning it to
   reformation of life, by pithy and lively exhortations; Catechizing is
   the first point, and but by Catechizing, the other cannot be attained.
   Besides, whereas in Sermons there is a kinde of state, in Catechizing
   there is an humblenesse very sutable to Christian regeneration, which
   exceedingly delights him as by way of exercise upon himself, and by way
   of preaching to himself, for the advancing of his own mortification;
   for in preaching to others, he forgets not himself, but is first a
   sermon to himself, and then to others; growing with the growth of his
   Parish. He useth, and preferreth the ordinary Church-Catechism, partly
   for obedience to Authority, partly for uniformity sake, that the same
   common truths may be every where professed, especially since many
   remove from Parish to Parish, who like Christian Souldiers are to give
   the word, and to satisfie the Congregation by their Catholick answers.
   He exacts of all the Doctrine of the Catechisme; of the younger sort,
   the very words; of the elder, the substance. Those he Catechizeth
   publickly, these privately, giving age honour, according to the
   Apostles rule, I Tim. 5. I. He requires all to be present at
   Catechizing: First, for the authority of the work; Secondly, that
   Parents, and Masters, as they hear the answers prove, may when they
   come home, either commend or reprove, either reward or punish. Thirdly,
   that thoseof the elder sort, who are not well grounded, may then by an
   honourable way take occasion to be better instructed. Fourthly, that
   those who are well grown in the knowledg of Religion, may examine their
   grounds, renew their vowes, and by occasion of both, inlarge their
   meditations. When once all have learned the words of the Catechisme, he
   thinks it the most usefull way that a Pastor can take, to go over the
   same, but in other words: for many say the Catechisme by rote, as
   parrats, without ever piercing into the sense of it. In this course the
   order of the Catechisme would be kept, but the rest varyed: as thus, in
   the Creed: How came this world to be as it is? Was it made, or came it
   by chance? Who made it? Did you see God make it? Then are there some
   things to be beleeved that are not seen? Is this the nature of beliefe?
   Is not Christianity full of such things, as are not to be seen, but
   beleeved? You said, God made the world; Who is God? And so forward,
   requiring answers to all these, and helping and cherishing the
   Answerer, by making the Question very plaine with comparisons, and
   making much even of a word of truth from him. This order being used to
   one, would be a little varyed to another. And this is an admirable way
   of teaching, wherein the Catechized will at length finde delight, and
   by which the Catechizer, if he once get the skill of it, will draw out
   of ignorant and silly souls, even the dark and deep points of Religion.
   Socrates did thus in Philosophy, who held that the seeds of all truths
   lay in every body, and accordingly by questions well ordered he found
   Philosophy in silly Trades-men. That position will not hold in
   Christianity, because it contains things above nature: but after that
   the Catechisme is once learn'd, that which nature is towards
   Philosophy, the Catechism is towards Divinity. To this purpose, some
   dialogues in Plato were worth the reading, where the singular dexterity
   of Socrates in this kind may be observed, and imitated. Yet the skill
   consists but in these three points: First, an aim and mark of the whole
   discourse, whither to drive the Answerer, which the Questionist must
   have in his mind before any question be propounded, upon which and to
   which the questions are to be chained. Secondly, a most plain and easie
   framing the question, even containing in vertue the answer also,
   especially to the more ignorant. Thirdly, when the answerer sticks, an
   illustrating the thing by something else, which he knows, making what
   hee knows to serve him in that which he knows not: As, when the Parson
   once demanded after other questions about mans misery; since man is so
   miserable, what is to be done? And the answerer could not tell; He
   asked him again, what he would do, if he were in a ditch? This familiar
   illustration made the answer so plaine, that he was even ashamed of his
   ignorance; for he could not but say, he would hast out of it as fast as
   he could. Then he proceeded to ask, whether he could get out of the
   ditch alone, or whether he needed a helper, and who was that helper.
   This is the skill, and doubtlesse the Holy Scripture intends thus much,
   when it condescends to the naming of a plough, a hatchet, a bushell,
   leaven, boyes piping and dancing; shewing that things of ordinary use
   are not only to serve in the way of drudgery, but to be washed and
   cleansed, and serve for lights even of Heavenly Truths. This is the
   Practice which the Parson so much commends to all his fellow-labourers;
   the secret of whose good consists in this, that at Sermons, and
   Prayers, men may sleep or wander; but when one is asked a question, he
   must discover what he is. This practice exceeds even Semons in
   teaching: but there being two things in Sermons, the one Informing, the
   other Inflaming; as Sermons come short of questions in the one, so they
   farre exceed them in the other. For questions cannot inflame or ravish,
   that must be done by a set, and laboured, and continued speech.

   CHAP. XXII. The Parson in Sacraments.

   THe Countrey Parson being to administer the Sacraments, is at a stand
   with himself, how or what behaviour to assume for so holy things.
   Especially at Communion times he is in a great confusion, as being not
   only to receive God, but to break, and administer him. Neither findes
   he any issue in this, but to throw himself down at the throne of grace,
   saying, Lord, thou knowest what thou didst, when thou appointedst it to
   be done thus; therefore doe thou fulfill what thou didst appoint; for
   thou art not only the feast, but the way to it. At Baptisme, being
   himselfe in white, he requires the presence of all, and Baptizeth not
   willingly, but on Sundayes, or great dayes. Hee admits no vaine or idle
   names, but such as are usuall and accustomed. Hee says that prayer with
   great devotion, where God is thanked for calling us to the knowledg of
   his grace, Baptisme being a blessing, that the world hath not the like.
   He willingly and cheerfully crosseth the child, and thinketh the
   Ceremony not onely innocent, but reverend. He instructeth the
   God-fathers, and God-mothers, that it is no complementall or light
   thing to sustain that place, but a great honour, and no less burden, as
   being done both in the presence of God, and his Saints, and by way of
   undertaking for a Christian soul. He adviseth all to call to minde
   their Baptism often; for if wise men have thought it the best way of
   preserving a state to reduce it to its principles by which it grew
   great; certainly, it is the safest course for Christians also to
   meditate on their Baptisme often (being the first step into their great
   and glorious calling) and upon what termes, and with what vowes they
   were Baptized. At the times of the Holy Communion, he first takes order
   with the Church-Wardens, that the elements be of the best, not cheape,
   or course, much lesse ill-tasted, or unwholsome. Secondly, hee
   considers and looks into the ignorance, or carelesness of his flock,
   and accordingly applies himselfe with Catechizings, and lively
   exhortations, not on the Sunday of the Communion only (for then it is
   too late) but the Sunday, or Sundayes before the Communion, or on the
   Eves of all those dayes. If there be any, who having not received yet,
   are to enter into this great work, he takes the more pains with them,
   that hee may lay the foundation of future Blessings. The time of every
   ones first receiving is not so much by yeers, as by understanding:
   particularly, the rule may be this: When any one can distinguish the
   Sacramentall from common bread, knowing the Institution, and the
   difference, hee ought to receive, of what age soever. Children and
   youths are usually deferred too long, under pretence of devotion to the
   Sacrament, but it is for want of Instruction; their understandings
   being ripe enough for ill things, and why not then for better? But
   Parents, and Masters should make hast in this, as to a great purchase
   for their children, and servants; which while they deferr, both sides
   suffer; the one in wanting many excitings of grace; the other, in being
   worse served and obeyed. The saying of the Catechism is necessary, but
   not enough; because to answer in form may still admit ignorance: but
   the Questions must be propounded loosely and wildely, and then the
   Answerer will discover what hee is. Thirdly, For the manner of
   receiving, as the Parson useth all reverence himself, so he administers
   to none but to the reverent. The Feast indeed requires sitting, because
   it is a Feast; but man's unpreparednesse asks kneeling. Hee that comes
   to the Sacrament, hath the confidence of a Guest, and hee that kneels,
   confesseth himself an unworthy one, and therefore differs from other
   Feasters: but hee that sits, or lies, puts up to an Apostle:
   Contentiousnesse in a feast of Charity is more scandall then any
   posture. Fourthly, touching the frequency of the Communion, the Parson
   celebrates it, if not duly once a month, yet at least five or six times
   in the year; as, at Easter, Christmasse, Whitsuntide, afore and after
   Harvest, and the beginning of Lent. And this hee doth, not onely for
   the benefit of the work, but also for the discharge of the
   Church-wardens, who being to present all that receive not thrice a
   year; if there be but three Communions, neither can all the people so
   order their affairs as to receive just at those times, nor the
   Church-Wardens so well take notice who receive thrice, and who not.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAP. XXIII. The Parson's Completenesse.

   THe Countrey Parson desires to be all to his Parish, and not onely a
   Pastour, but a Lawyer also, and a Phisician. Therefore hee endures not
   that any of his Flock should go to Law; but in any Controversie, that
   they should resort to him as their Judge. To this end, he hath gotten
   to himself some insight in things ordinarily incident and controverted,
   by experience, and by reading some initiatory treatises in the Law,
   with Daltons Justice of Peace, and the Abridgements of the Statutes, as
   also by discourse with men of that profession, whom he hath ever some
   cases to ask, when he meets with them; holding that rule, that to put
   men to discourse of that, wherin they are most eminent, is the most
   gain full way of Conversation. Yet when ever any controversie is
   brought to him, he never decides it alone, but sends for three or four
   of the ablest of the Parish to hear the cause with him, whom he makes
   to deliver their opinion first; out of which he gathers, in case he be
   ignorant himself, what to hold; and so the thing passeth with more
   authority, and lesse envy. In judging, he followes that, which is
   altogether right; so that if the poorest man of the Parish detain but a
   pin unjustly from the richest, he absolutely restores it as a Judge;
   but when he hath so done, then he assumes the Parson, and exhorts to
   Charity. Neverthelesse, there may happen somtimes some cases, wherein
   he chooseth to permit his Parishioners rather to make use of the Law,
   then himself: As in cases of an obscure and dark nature, not easily
   determinable by Lawyers themselves; or in cases of high consequence, as
   establishing of inheritances: or Lastly, when the persons in difference
   are of a contentious disposition, and cannot be gained, but that they
   still fall from all compromises that have been made. But then he shews
   them how to go to Law, even as Brethren, and not as enemies, neither
   avoyding therfore one anothers company, much lesse defaming one
   another. Now as the Parson is in Law, so is he in sicknesse also: if
   there be any of his flock sick, hee is their Physician, or at least his
   Wife, of whom in stead of the qualities of the world, he asks no other,
   but to have the skill of healing a wound, or helping the sick. But if
   neither himseife, nor his wife have the skil, and his means serve, hee
   keepes some young practicioner in his house for the benefit of his
   Parish, whom yet he ever exhorts not to exceed his bounds, but in
   tickle cases to call in help. If all fail, then he keeps good
   correspondence with some neighbour Phisician, and entertaines him for
   the Cure of his Parish. Yet is it easie for any Scholer to attaine to
   such a measure of Phisick, as may be of much use to him both for
   himself, and others. This is done by seeing one Anatomy, reading one
   Book of Phisick, having one Herball by him. And let Fernelius be the
   Phisick Authour, for he writes briefly, neatly, and judiciously;
   especially let his Method of Phisick be diligently perused, as being
   the practicall part, and of most use. Now both the reading of him, and
   the knowing of herbs may be done at such times, as they may be an help,
   and a recreation to more divine studies, Nature serving Grace both in
   comfort of diversion, and the benefit of application when need
   requires; as also by way of illustration, even as our Saviour made
   plants and seeds to teach the people: for he was the true householder,
   who bringeth out of his treasure things new and old; the old things of
   Philosophy, and the new of Grace; and maketh the one serve the other.
   And I conceive, our Saviour did this for three reasons: first, that by
   familiar things hee might make his Doctrine slip the more easily into
   the hearts even of the meanest. Secondly, that labouring people (whom
   he chiefly considered) might have every where monuments of his
   Doctrine, remembring in gardens, his mustard-seed, and lillyes; in the
   field, his seed-corn, and tares; and so not be drowned altogether in
   the works of their vocation, but sometimes lift up their minds to
   better things, even in the midst of their pains. Thirdly, that he might
   set a Copy for Parsons. In the knowledge of simples, wherein the
   manifold wisedome of God is wonderfully to be seen, one thing would be
   carefully observed; which is, to know what herbs may be used in stead
   of drugs of the same nature, and to make the garden the shop: For
   home-bred medicines are both more easie for the Parsons purse, and more
   familiar for all mens bodyes. So, where the Apothecary useth either for
   loosing, Rubarb, or for binding, Bolearmena, the Parson useth damask or
   white Roses for the one, and plantaine, shepherds purse, knot-grasse
   for the other, and that with better successe. As for spices, he doth
   not onely prefer home-bred things before them, but condemns them for
   vanities, and so shuts them out of his family, esteeming that there is
   no spice comparable, for herbs, to rosemary, time, savoury, mints; and
   for seeds, to Fennell, and Carroway seeds. Accordingly, for salves, his
   wife seeks not the city, but preferrs her garden and fields before all
   outlandish gums. And surely hyssope, valerian, mercury, adders tongue,
   yerrow, melilot, and Saint Johns wort made into a salve; And Elder,
   camomill, mallowes, comphrey and smallage made into a Poultis, have
   done great and rare cures. In curing of any, the Parson and his Family
   use to premise prayers, for this is to cure like a Parson, and this
   raiseth the action from the Shop, to the Church. But though the Parson
   sets forward all Charitable deeds, yet he looks not in this point of
   Curing beyond his own Parish, except the person bee so poor, that he is
   not able to reward the Phisician: for as hee is Charitable, so he is
   just also. Now it is a justice and debt to the Commonwealth he lives
   in, not to incroach on others Professions, but to live on his own. And
   justice is the ground of Charity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAP. XXIV. The Parson arguing.

   THe Countrey Parson, if there be any of his parish that hold strange
   Doctrins, useth all possible diligence to reduce them to the common
   Faith. The first means he useth is Prayer, beseeching the Father of
   lights to open their eyes, and to give him power so to fit his
   discourse to them, that it may effectually pierce their hearts, and
   convert them. The second means is a very loving, and sweet usage of
   them, both in going to, and sending for them often, and in finding out
   Courtesies to place on them; as in their tithes, or otherwise. The
   third means is the observation what is the main foundation, and pillar
   of their cause, whereon they rely; as if he be a Papist, the Church is
   the hinge he turnes on; if a Schismatick, scandall. Wherefore the
   Parson hath diligently examined these two with himselfe, as what the
   Church is, how it began, how it proceeded, whether it be a rule to it
   selfe, whether it hath a rule, whether having a rule, it ought not to
   be guided by it; whether any rule in the world be obscure, and how then
   should the best be so, at least in fundamentall things, the obscurity
   in some points being the exercise of the Church, the light in the
   foundations being the guide; The Church needing both an evidence, and
   an exercise. So for Scandall: what scandall is, when given or taken;
   whether, there being two precepts, one of obeying Authority, the other
   of not giving scandall, that ought not to be preferred, especially
   since in disobeying there is scandall also: whether things once
   indifferent, being made by the precept of Authority more then
   indifferent, it be in our power to omit or refuse them. These and the
   like points hee hath accurately digested, having ever besides two great
   helps and powerfull perswaders on his side; the one, a strict religious
   life; the other an humble, and ingenuous search of truth; being unmoved
   in arguing, and voyd of all contentiousnesse: which are two great
   lights able to dazle the eyes of the misled, while they consider, that
   God cannot be wanting to them in Doctrine, to whom he is so gracious in
   Life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAP. XXV. The Parson punishing.

   Whensoever the Countrey Parson proceeds so farre as to call in
   Authority, and to do such things of legall opposition either in the
   presenting, or punishing of any, as the vulgar ever consters for signes
   of ill will; he forbears not in any wise to use the delinquent as
   before, in his behaviour and carriage towards him, not avoyding his
   company, or doing any thing of aversenesse, save in the very act of
   punishment: neither doth he esteem him for an enemy, but as a brother
   still, except some small and temporary estrangling may corroborate the
   punishment to a better subduing, and humbling of the delinquent; which
   if it happily take effect, he then comes on the faster, and makes so
   much the more of him, as before he alienated himselfe; doubling his
   regards, and shewing by all means, that the delinquents returne is to
   his advantage.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAP. XXVI. The Parson's eye.

   THe Countrey Parson at spare times from action, standing on a hill, and
   considering his Flock, discovers two sorts of vices, and two sorts of
   vicious persons. There are some vices, whose natures are alwayes deer,
   and evident, as Adultery, Murder, Hatred, Lying, &c. There are other
   vices, whose natures, at least in the beginning, are dark and obscure:
   as Covetousnesse, and Gluttony. So likewise there are some persons, who
   abstain not even from known sins; there are others, who when they know
   a sin evidently, they commit it not. It is true indeed, they are long a
   knowing it, being partiall to themselves, and witty to others who shall
   reprove them from it. A man may be both Covetous, and Intemperate, and
   yet hear Sermons against both, and himselfe condemn both in good
   earnest: and the reason hereof is, because the natures of these vices
   being not evidently discussed, or known commonly, the beginnings of
   them are not easily observable: and the beginnings of them are not
   observed, because of the suddain passing from that which was just now
   lawfull, to that which is presently unlawfull, even in one continued
   action. So a man dining, eats at first lawfully; but proceeding on,
   comes to do unlawfully, even before he is aware; not knowing the bounds
   of the action, nor when his eating begins to be unlawfull. So a man
   storing up mony for his necessary provisions, both in present for his
   family, and in future for his children, hardly perceives when his
   storing becomes unlawfull: yet is there a period for his storing, and a
   point, or center, when his storing, which was even now good, passeth
   from good to bad. Wherefore the Parson being true to his businesse,
   hath exactly sifted the definitions of all vertues, and vices;
   especially canvasing those, whose natures are most stealing, and
   beginnings uncertaine. Particularly, concerning these two vices, not
   because they are all that are of this dark, and creeping disposition,
   but for example sake, and because they are most common, he thus thinks:
   first, for covetousnes, he lays this ground: Whosoever when a just
   occasion cals, either spends not at all, or not in some proportion to
   Gods blessing upon him is covetous. The reason of the ground is
   manifest, because wealth is given to that end to supply our occasions.
   Now, if I do not give every thing its end, I abuse the Creature, I am
   false to my reason which should guide me, I offend the supreme Judg, in
   perverting that order which he hath set both to things, and to reason.
   The application of the ground would be infinite; but in brief, a poor
   man is an occasion, my countrey is an occasion, my friend is an
   occasion, my Table is an occasion, my apparell is an occasion: if in
   all these, and those more which concerne me, I either do nothing, or
   pinch, and scrape, and squeeze blood undecently to the station wherein
   God hath placed me, I am Covetous. More particularly, and to give one
   instance for all, if God have given me servants, and I either provide
   too little for them, or that which is unwholsome, being sometimes baned
   meat, sometimes too salt, and so not competent nourishment, I am
   Covetous. I bring this example, because men usually think, that
   servants for their mony are as other things that they buy, even as a
   piece of wood, which they may cut, or hack, or throw into the fire, and
   so they pay them their wages, all is well. Nay, to descend yet more
   particularly, if a man hath wherewithall to buy a spade, and yet hee
   chuseth rather to use his neighbours, and wear out that, he is
   covetous. Nevertheless, few bring covetousness thus low, or consider it
   so narrowly, which yet ought to be done, since there is a Justice in
   the least things, and for the least there shall be a judgment. Country
   people are full of these petty injustices, being cunning to make use of
   another, and spare themselves: And Scholers ought to be diligent in the
   observation of these, and driving of their generall Schoole rules ever
   to the smallest actions of Life; which while they dwell in their
   bookes, they will never finde; but being seated in the Countrey, and
   doing their duty faithfully, they will soon discover: especially if
   they carry their eyes ever open, and fix them on their charge, and not
   on their preferment. Secondly, for Gluttony, the parson lays this
   ground: He that either for quantity eats more then his health or
   imployments will bear, or for quality is licorous after dainties, is a
   glutton; as he that eats more then his estate will bear, is a
   Prodigall; and hee that eats offensively to the Company, either in his
   order, or length of eating, is scandalous and uncharitable. These three
   rules generally comprehend the faults of eating, and the truth of them
   needs no proofe: so that men must eat neither to the disturbance of
   their health, nor of their affairs, (which being overburdened, or
   studying dainties too much, they cannot wel dispatch) nor of their
   estate, nor of their brethren. One act in these things is bad, but it
   is the custome and habit that names a glutton. Many think they are at
   more liberty then they are, as if they were Masters of their health,
   and so they will stand to the pain, all is well. But to eat to ones
   hurt, comprehends, besides the hurt, an act against reason, because it
   is unnaturall to hurt ones self; and this they are not masters of. Yet
   of hurtfull things, I am more bound to abstain from those, which by
   mine own experience I have found hurtfull, then from those which by a
   Common tradition, and vulgar knowledge are reputed to be so. That which
   is said of hurtfull meats, extends to hurtfull drinks also. As for the
   quantity, touching our imployments, none must eat so as to disable
   themselves from a fit discharging either of Divine duties, or duties of
   their calling. So that if after dinner they are not fit (or unweeldy)
   either to pray, or work, they are gluttons. Not that all must presently
   work after dinner; (For they rather must not work, especially Students,
   and those that are weakly,) but that they must rise so, as that it is
   not meate or drinke that hinders them from working. To guide them in
   this, there are three rules: first, the custome, and knowledg of their
   own body, and what it can well disgest: The second, the feeling of
   themselves in time of eating, which because it is deceitfull; (for one
   thinks in eating, that he can eat more, then afterwards he finds true:)
   The third is the observation with what appetite they sit down. This
   last rule joyned with the first, never fails. For knowing what one
   usually can well disgest, and feeling when I go to meat in what
   disposition I am, either hungry or not, according as I feele my self,
   either I take my wonted proportion, or diminish of it. Yet Phisicians
   bid those that would live in health, not keep an uniform diet, but to
   feed variously, now more, now lesse: And Gerson, a spirituall man,
   wisheth all to incline rather to too much, then to too little; his
   reason is, because diseases of exinanition^ are more dangerous, then
   diseases of repletion. But the Parson distinguisheth according to his
   double aime, either of Abstinence a morall vertue, or Mortification a
   divine. When he deals with any that is heavy, and carnall; he gives him
   those freer rules: but when he meets with a refined, and heavenly
   disposition, he carryes them higher, even somtimes to a forgetting of
   themselves, knowing that there is one, who when they forget, remembers
   for them; As when the people hungred and thirsted after our Saviours
   Doctrine, and tarryed so long at it, that they would have fainted, had
   they returned empty, He suffered it not; but rather made food
   miraculously, then suffered so good desires to miscarry.

   CHAP. XXVII. The Parson in mirth.

   THe Countrey Parson is generally sad, because hee knows nothing but the
   Crosse of Christ, his minde being defixed on it with those nailes
   wherewith his Master was: or if he have any leisure to look off from
   thence, he meets continually with two most sad spectacles. Sin, and
   Misery; God dishonoured every day, and man afflicted. Neverthelesse, he
   somtimes refresheth himselfe, as knowing that nature will not bear
   everlasting droopings, and that pleasantnesse of disposition is a great
   key to do good; not onely because all men shun the company of
   perpetuall severity, but also for that when they are in company,
   instructions seasoned with pleasantnesse, both enter sooner, and roote
   deeper. Wherefore he condescends to humane frailties both in himseife
   and others; and intermingles some mirth in his discourses occasionally,
   according to the pulse of the hearer.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAP. XXVIII. The Parson in Contempt.

   THe Countrey Parson knows well, that both for the generall ignominy
   which is cast upon the profession, and much more for those rules, which
   out of his choysest judgment hee hath resolved to observe, and which
   are described in this Book, he must be despised; because this hath been
   the portion of God his Master, and of Gods Saints his Brethren, and
   this is foretold, that it shall be so still, until things be no more.
   Neverthelesse, according to the Apostles rule, he endeavours that none
   shall despise him; especially in his own Parish he suffers it not to
   his utmost power; for that, where contempt is, there is no room for
   instruction. This he procures, first by his holy and unblameable life;
   which carries a reverence with it, even above contempt. Secondly, by a
   courteous carriage, & winning behaviour: he that wil be respected, must
   respect; doing kindnesses, but receiving none; at least of those, who
   are apt to despise: for this argues a height and eminency of mind,
   which is not easily despised, except it degenerate to pride. Thirdly,
   by a bold and impartial reproof, even of the best in the Parish, when
   occasion requires: for this may produce hatred in those that are
   reproved, but never contempt either in them, or others. Lastly, if the
   contempt shall proceed so far as to do any thing punishable by law, as
   contempt is apt to do, if it be not thwarted, the Parson having a due
   respect both to the person, and to the cause, referreth the whole
   matter to the examination, and punishment of those which are in
   Authority, that so the sentence lighting upon one, the example may
   reach to all. But if the Contempt be not punishable by Law, or being
   so, the Parson think it in his discretion either unfit, or bootelesse
   to contend, then when any despises him, he takes it either in an humble
   way, saying nothing at all; or else in a slighting way, shewing that
   reproaches touch him no more, then a stone thrown against heaven, where
   he is, and lives; or in a sad way, grieved at his own, and others sins,
   which continually breake Gods Laws, and dishonour him with those
   mouths, which he continually fils, and feeds: or else in a doctrinall
   way, saying to the contemner, Alas, why do you thus? you hurt your
   selfe, not me; he that throws a stone at another, hits himseife; and so
   between gentle reasoning, and pitying, he overcomes the evill: or
   lastly, in a Triumphant way, being glad, and Joyfull, that he is made
   conformable to his Master; and being in the world as he was, hath this
   undoubted pledge of his salvation. These are the five shields,
   wherewith the Godly receive the darts of the wicked; leaving anger, and
   retorting, and revenge to the children of the world, whom anothers ill
   mastereth, and leadeth captive without any resistance, even in
   resistance, to the same destruction. For while they resist the person
   that reviles, they resist not the evill which takes hold of them, and
   is farr the worse enemy.

   CHAP. XXIX. The Parson with his Church-Wardens.

   THe Countrey Parson doth often, both publickly, and privately instruct
   his Church-Wardens, what a great Charge lyes upon them, and that indeed
   the whole order and discipline of the Parish is put into their hands.
   If himselfe reforme any thing, it is out of the overflowing of his
   Conscience, whereas they are to do it by Command, and by Oath. Neither
   hath the place its dignity from the Ecclesiasticall Laws only, since
   even by the Common Statute-Law they are taken for a kinde of
   Corporation, as being persons enabled by that Name to take moveable
   goods, or chattels, and to sue, and to be sued at the Law concerning
   such goods for the use and profit of their Parish: and by the same Law
   they are to levy penalties for negligence in resorting to church, or
   for disorderly carriage in time of divine service. Wherefore the Parson
   suffers not the place to be vilified or debased, by being cast on the
   lower ranke of people; but invites and urges the best unto it, shewing
   that they do not loose, or go lesse, but gaine by it; it being the
   greatest honor of this world, to do God and his chosen service; or as
   David says, to be even a door-keeper in the house of God. Now the
   Canons being the Church-wardens rule, the Parson adviseth them to read,
   or hear them read often, as also the visitation Articles, which are
   grounded upon the Canons, that so they may know their duty, and keep
   their oath the better; in which regard, considering the great
   Consequence of their place, and more of their oath, he wisheth them by
   no means to spare any, though never so great; but if after gentle, and
   neighbourly admonitions they still persist in ill, to present them; yea
   though they be tenants, or otherwise ingaged to the delinquent: for
   their obligation to God, and their own soul, is above any temporall
   tye. Do well, and right, and let the world sinke.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAP. XXX. The Parson's Consideration of Providence.

   THe Countrey Parson considering the great aptnesse if Countrey people
   have to think that all things come by a kind of naturall course; and
   that if they sow and soyle their grounds, they must have corn; if they
   keep and fodder well their cattel, they must have milk, and Calves;
   labours to reduce them to see Gods hand in all things. and to beleeve.
   that things are not set in such an inevitable order, but that God often
   changeth it according as he sees fit, either for reward or punishment.
   To this end he represents to his flock, that God hath and exerciseth a
   threefold power in every thing which concernes man. The first is a
   sustaining power; the second a governing power; the third a spirituall
   power. By his sustaining power he preserves and actuates every thing in
   his being; so that corne doth not grow by any other vertue, then by
   that which he continually supplies, as the corn needs it; without which
   supply the corne would instantly dry up, as a river would if the
   fountain were stopped. And it is observable, that if anything could
   presume of an inevitable course, and constancy in its operations,
   certainly it should be either the sun in heaven, or the fire on earth,
   by reason of their fierce, strong, and violent natures: yet when God
   pleased, the sun stood stil, the fire burned not. By Gods governing
   power he preserves and orders the references of things one to the
   other, so that though the corn do grow, and be preserved in that act by
   his sustaining power, yet if he suite not other things to the growth,
   as seasons, and weather, and other accidents by his governing power,
   the fairest harvests come to nothing. And it is observeable, that God
   delights to have men feel, and acknowledg, and reverence his power, and
   therefore he often overturnes things, when they are thought past
   danger; that is his time of interposing: As when a Merchant hath a ship
   come home after many a storme, which it hath escaped, he destroyes it
   sometimes in the very Haven; or if the goods be housed, a fire hath
   broken forth, and suddenly consumed them. Now this he doth, that men
   should perpetuate, and not break off their acts of dependance, how
   faire soever the opportunities present themselves. So that if a farmer
   should depend upon God all the yeer, and being ready to put hand to
   sickle, shall then secure himself, and think all cock-sure; then God
   sends such weather, as lays the corn, and destroys it: or if he depend
   on God further, even till he imbarn his corn, and then think all sure;
   God sends a fire, and consumes all that he hath: For that he ought not
   to break off, but to continue his dependance on God, not onely before
   the corne is inned, but after also; and indeed, to depend, and fear
   continually. The third power is spirituall, by which God turnes all
   outward blessings to inward advantages. So that if a Farmer hath both a
   faire harvest, and that also well inned, and imbarned, and continuing
   safe there; yet if God give him not the Grace to use, and utter this
   well, all his advantages are to his losse. Better were his corne burnt,
   then not spiritually improved. And it is observable in this, how Gods
   goodnesse strives with mans refractorinesse; Man would sit down at this
   world, God bids him sell it, and purchase a better: Just as a Father,
   who hath in his hand an apple, and a piece of Gold under it; the Child
   comes, and with pulling, gets the apple out of his Fathers hand: his
   Father bids him throw it away, and he will give him the gold for it,
   which the Child utterly refusing, eats it, and is troubled with wormes:
   So is the carnall and wilfull man with the worm of the grave in this
   world, and the worm of Conscience in the next.

   CHAP. XXXI. The Parson in Liberty.

   THe Countrey Parson observing the manifold wiles of Satan (who playes
   his part sometimes in drawing Gods Servants from him, sometimes in
   perplexing them in the service of God) stands fast in the Liberty
   wherewith Christ hath made us free. This Liberty he compasseth by one
   distinction, and that is, of what is Necessary, and what is
   Additionary. As for example: It is necessary, that all Christians
   should pray twice a day, every day of the week, and four times on
   Sunday, if they be well. This is so necessary, and essentiall to a
   Christian, that he cannot without this maintain himself in a Christian
   state. Besides this, the Godly have ever added some houres of prayer,
   as at nine, or at three, or at midnight, or as they think fit, & see
   cause, or rather as Gods spirit leads them. But these prayers are not
   necessary, but additionary. Now it so happens, that the godly
   petitioner upon some emergent interruption in the day, or by
   over-sleeping himself at night, omits his additionary prayer. Upon this
   his mind begins to be perplexed, and troubled, and Satan, who knows the
   exigent, blows the fire, endeavouring to disorder the Christian, and
   put him out of his station, and to inlarge the perplexity, untill it
   spread, and taint his other duties or piety, which none can perform so
   wel in trouble, as in calmness. Here the Parson interposeth with his
   distinction, and shews the perplexed Christian, that this prayer being
   additionary, not necessary; taken in, not commanded, the omission
   thereof upon just occasion ought by no means to trouble him. God knows
   the occasion as wel as he, and He is as a gracious Father, who more
   accepts a common course of devotion, then dislikes an occasionall
   interruption. And of this he is so to assure himself, as to admit no
   scruple, but to go on as cheerfully, as if he had not been interrupted.
   By this it is evident, that the distinction is of singular use and
   comfort, especially to pious minds, which are ever tender, and
   delicate. But here there are two Cautions to be added. First, that this
   interruption proceed not out of slacknes, or coldness, which will
   appear if the Pious soul foresee and prevent such interruptions, what
   he may, before they come, and when for all that they do come, he be a
   little affected therewith, but not afflicted, or troubled; if he resent
   it to a mislike, but not a griefe. Secondly, that this interruption
   proceede not out of shame. As for example: A godly man, not out of
   superstition, but of reverence to Gods house, resolves whenever he
   enters into a Church, to kneel down, and pray, either blessing God,
   that he will be pleased to dwell among men; or beseeching him, that
   whenever he repaires to his house, he may behave himself so as befits
   so great a presence; and this briefly. But it happens, that neer the
   place where he is to pray, he spyes some scoffing ruffian, who is
   likely to deride him for his paines: if he now, shall either for fear
   or shame, break his custome, he shall do passing ill: so much the
   rather ought he to proceed, as that by this he may take into his Prayer
   humiliation also. On the other side, if I am to visit the sick in
   haste, and my neerest way ly through the Church, I will not doubt to go
   without staying to pray there (but onely, as I passe, in my heart)
   because this kinde of Prayer is additionary, not necessary, and the
   other duty overweighs it: So that if any scruple arise, I will throw it
   away, and be most confident, that God is not displeased. This
   distinction may runne through all Christian duties, and it is a great
   stay and setling to religious souls.

   CHAP. XXXII. The Parson's Surveys.

   THe Countrey Parson hath not onely taken a particular Survey of the
   faults of his own Parish, but a generall also of the diseases of the
   time, that so, when his occasions carry him abroad, or bring strangers
   to him, he may be the better armed to encounter them. The great and
   nationall sin of this Land he esteems to be Idlenesse; great in it
   selfe, and great in Consequence: For when men have nothing to do, then
   they fall to drink, to steal, to whore, to scoffe, to revile, to all
   sorts of gamings. Come, say they, we have nothing to do, lets go to the
   Tavern, or to the stews, or what not. Wherefore the Parson strongly
   opposeth this sin, whersoever he goes. And because Idleness is twofold,
   the one in having no calling, the other in walking carelesly in our
   calling, he first represents to every body the necessity of a vocation.
   The reason of this assertion is taken from the nature of man, wherein
   God hath placed two great Instruments, Reason in the soul, and a hand
   in the Body, as ingagements of working: So that even in Paradise man
   had a calling, and how much more out of Paradise, when the evills which
   he is now subject unto, may be prevented, or diverted by reasonable
   imployment. Besides, every gift or ability is a talent to be accounted
   for, and to be improved to our Masters Advantage. Yet is it also a debt
   to our Countrey to have a Calling, and it concernes the Common-wealth,
   that none should be idle, but all busied. Lastly, riches are the
   blessing of God, and the great Instrument of doing admirable good;
   therfore all are to procure them honestly, and seasonably, when they
   are not better imployed. Now this reason crosseth not our Saviours
   precept of selling what we have, because when we have sold all, and
   given it to the poor, we must not be idle, but labour to get more, that
   we may give more, according to St. Pauls rule, Ephes. 4. 28. I Thes. 4.
   11, 12. So that our Saviours selling is so far from crossing Saint
   Pauls working, that it rather establisheth it, since they that have
   nothing, are fittest to work. Now because the onely opposer to this
   Doctrine is the Gallant, who is witty enough to abuse both others, and
   himself, and who is ready to ask, if he shall mend shoos, or what he
   shall do? Therfore the Parson unmoved, sheweth, that ingenuous and fit
   imployment is never wanting to those that seek it. But if it should be,
   the Assertion stands thus: All are either to have a Calling, or prepare
   for it: He that hath or can have yet no imployment, if he truly, and
   seriously prepare for it, he is safe and within bounds. Wherefore all
   are either presently to enter into a Calling, if they be fit for it,
   and it for them; or else to examinewith care, and advice, what they are
   fittest for, and to prepare for that with all diligence. But it will
   not be amisse in this exceeding usefull point to descend to
   particulars: for exactnesse lyes in particulars. Men are either single,
   or marryed: The marryed and house-keeper hath his hands full, if he do
   what he ought to do. For there are two branches of his affaires; first,
   the improvement of his family, by bringing them up in the fear and
   nurture of the Lord; and secondly, the improvement of his grounds, by
   drowning, or draining, or stocking, or fencing, and ordering his land
   to the best advantage both of himself, and his neighbours. The Italian
   says, None fouls his hands in his own businesse: and it is an honest,
   and just care, so it exceed not bounds, for every one to imploy
   himselfe to the advancement of his affairs, that hee may have
   wherewithall to do good. But his family is his best care, to labour
   Christian soules, and raise them to their height, even to heaven; to
   dresse and prune them, and take as much joy in a straight-growing
   childe, or servant, as a Gardiner doth in a choice tree. Could men
   finde out this delight, they would seldome be from home; whereas now,
   of any place, they are least there. But if after all this care well
   dispatched, the house-keepers Family be so small, and his dexterity so
   great, that he have leisure to look out, the Village or Parish which
   either he lives in, or is neer unto it, is his imployment. Hee
   considers every one there, and either helps them in particular, or hath
   generall Propositions to the whole Towne or Hamlet, of advancing the
   publick Stock, and managing Commons, or Woods, according as the place
   suggests. But if hee may bee of the Commission of Peace, there is
   nothing to that: No Common-wealth in the world hath a braver
   Institution then that of Justices of the Peace: For it is both a
   security to the King, who hath so many dispersed Officers at his beck
   throughout the Kingdome, accountable for the publick good; and also an
   honourable Imployment of a Gentle, or Noble-man in the Country he lives
   in, inabling him with power to do good, and to restrain all those, who
   else might both trouble him and the whole State. Wherefore it behoves
   all, who are come to the gravitie, and ripenesse of judgement for so
   excellent a Place, not to refuse, but rather to procure it. And whereas
   there are usually three Objections made against the Place; the one, the
   abuse of it, by taking petty Countrey bribes; the other, the casting of
   it on mean persons, especially in some Shires: and lastly, the trouble
   of it: These are so far from deterring any good man from the place,
   that they kindle them rather to redeem the Dignity either from true
   faults, or unjust aspersions. Now, for single men, they are either
   Heirs, or younger Brothers: The Heirs are to prepare in all the
   fore-mentioned points against the time of their practice. Therefore
   they are to mark their Fathers discretion in ordering his House and
   Affairs; and also elsewhere, when they see any remarkable point of
   Education or good husbandry, and to transplant it in time to his own
   home, with the same care as others, when they meet with good fruit, get
   a graffe of the tree, inriching their Orchard, and neglecting their
   House. Besides, they are to read Books of Law, and Justice; especially,
   the Statutes at large. As for better Books of Divinity, they are not in
   this Consideration, because we are about a Calling, and a preparation
   thereunto. But chiefly, and above all things, they are to frequent
   Sessions and Sizes; for it is both an honor which they owe to the
   Reverend Judges and Magistrates, to attend them, at least in their
   Shire; and it is a great advantage to know the practice of the Land;
   for our Law is Practice. Sometimes he may go to Court, as the eminent
   place both of good and ill. At other times he is to travell over the
   King's Dominions, cutting out the Kingdome into Portions, which every
   yeer he surveys peecemeal. When there is a Parliament, he is to
   endeavour by all means to be a Knight or Burgess there; for there is no
   School to a Parliament. And when he is there, he must not only be a
   morning man, but at Committees also; for there the particulars are
   exactly discussed, which are brought from thence to the House but in
   generall. When none of these occasions call him abroad, every morning
   that hee is at home hee must either ride the Great Horse, or exercise
   some of his Military gestures. For all Gentlemen, that are now weakned,
   and disarmed with sedentary lives, are to know the use of their Arms:
   and as the Husbandman labours for them, so must they fight for, and
   defend them, when occasion calls. This is the duty of each to other,
   which they ought to fulfill: And the Parson is a lover of and exciter
   to justice in all things, even as John the Baptist squared out to every
   one (even to Souldiers) what to do. As for younger Brothers, those whom
   the Parson finds loose, and not ingaged into some Profession by their
   Parents, whose neglect in this point is intolerable, and a shamefull
   wrong both to the Common-wealth, and their own House: To them, after he
   hath shew'd the unlawfulness of spending the day in dressing,
   Complementing, visiting, and sporting, he first commends the study of
   the Civill Law, as a brave, and wise knowledg, the Professours whereof
   were much imployed by Queen Elizabeth, because it is the key of
   Commerce, and discovers the Rules of forraine Nations. Secondly, he
   commends the Mathematicks, as the only wonder-working knowledg, and
   therefore requiring the best spirits. After the severall knowledg of
   these, he adviseth to insist and dwell chiefly on the two noble
   branches therof, of Fortification, and Navigation; The one being
   usefull to all Countreys, and the other especially to Hands. But if the
   young Gallant think these Courses dull, and phlegmatick, where can he
   busie himself better, then in those new Plantations, and discoveryes,
   which are not only a noble, but also as they may be handled, a
   religious imployment? Or let him travel into Germany, and France, and
   observing the Artifices, and Manufactures there, transplant them
   hither, as divers have done lately, to our Countrey's advantage.

   CHAP. XXXIII. The Parson's Library.

   THe Countrey Parson's Library is a holy Life: for besides the blessing
   that that brings upon it, there being a promise, that if the Kingdome
   of God be first sought, all other things shall be added, even it selfe
   is a Sermon. For the temptations with which a good man is beset, and
   the ways which he used to overcome them, being told to another, whether
   in private conference, or in the Church, are a Sermon. Hee that hath
   considered how to carry himself at table about his appetite, if he tell
   this to another, preacheth; and much more feelingly, and judiciously,
   then he writes his rules of temperance out of bookes. So that the
   Parson having studied, and mastered all his lusts and affections
   within, and the whole Army of Temptations without, hath ever so many
   sermons ready penn'd, as he hath victories. And it fares in this as it
   doth in Physick: He that hath been sick of a Consumption, and knows
   what recovered him, is a Physitian so far as he meetes with the same
   disease, and temper; and can much better, and particularly do it, then
   he that is generally learned, and was never sick. And if the same
   person had been sick of all diseases, and were recovered of all by
   things that he knew; there were no such Physician as he, both for skill
   and tendernesse. Just so it is in Divinity, and that not without
   manifest reason: for though the temptations may be diverse in divers
   Christians, yet the victory is alike in all, being by the self-same
   Spirit. Neither is this true onely in the military state of a Christian
   life, but even in the peaceable also; when the servant of God, freed
   for a while from temptation, in a quiet sweetnesse seeks how to please
   his God. Thus the Parson considering that repentance is the great
   vertue of the Gospel, and one of the first steps of pleasing God,
   having for his owne use examined the nature of it, is able to explaine
   it after to others. And particularly, having doubted sometimes, whether
   his repentance were true, or at least in that degree it ought to be,
   since he found himselfe sometimes to weepe more for the losse of some
   temporall things, then for offending God, he came at length to this
   resolution, that repentance is an act of the mind, not of the Body,
   even as the Originall signifies; and that the chiefe thing, which God
   in Scriptures requires, is the heart, and the spirit, and to worship
   him in truth, and spirit. Wherefore in case a Christian endeavour to
   weep, and cannot, since we are not Masters of our bodies, this
   sufficeth. And consequently he found, that the essence of repentance,
   that it may be alike in all Gods children (which as concerning weeping
   it cannot be, some being of a more melting temper then others)
   consisteth in a true detestation of the soul, abhorring, and renouncing
   sin, and turning unto God in truth of heart, and newnesse of life:
   Which acts of repentance are and must be found in all Gods servants:
   Not that weeping is not usefull, where it can be, that so the body may
   joyn in the grief, as it did in the sin; but that, so the other acts
   be, that is not necessary: so that he as truly repents, who performes
   the other acts of repentance, when he cannot more, as he that weeps a
   floud of tears. This Instruction and comfort the Parson getting for
   himself, when he tels it to others, becomes a Sermon. The like he doth
   in other Christian vertues, as of Faith, and Love, and the Cases of
   Conscience belonging thereto, wherein (as Saint Paul implyes that he
   ought, Romans 2.[21]) hee first preacheth to himselfe, and then to
   others.

   CHAP. XXXIV. The Parson's Dexterity in applying of Remedies.

   THe Countrey Parson knows, that there is a double state of a Christian
   even in this Life, the one military, the other peaceable. The military
   is, when we are assaulted with temptations either from within or from
   without, The Peaceable is, when the Divell for a time leaves us, as he
   did our Saviour, and the Angels minister to us their owne food, even
   joy, and peace; and comfort in the holy Ghost. These two states were in
   our Saviour, not only in the beginning of his preaching, but afterwards
   also, as Mat. 22. 35. He was tempted: And Luke IO. 2I. He rejoyced in
   Spirit: And they must be likewise in all that are his. Now the Parson
   having a Spirituall Judgement, according as he discovers any of his
   Flock to be in one or the other state, so he applies himselfe to them.
   Those that he findes in the peaceable state, he adviseth to be very
   vigilant, and not to let go the raines as soon as the horse goes easie.
   Particularly, he counselleth them to two things: First, to take heed,
   lest their quiet betray them (as it is apt to do) to a coldnesse, and
   carelesnesse in their devotions, but to labour still to be as fervent
   in Christian Duties, as they remember themselves were, when affliction
   did blow the Coals. Secondly, not to take the full compasse, and
   liberty of their Peace: not to eate of all those dishes at table, which
   even their present health otherwise admits; nor to store their house
   with all those furnitures which even their present plenty of wealth
   otherwise admits; nor when they are among them that are merry, to
   extend themselves to all that mirth, which the present occasion of wit
   and company otherwise admits; but to put bounds, and hoopes to their
   joyes: so will they last the longer, and when they depart, returne the
   sooner. If we would judg ourselves, we should not be judged; and if we
   would bound our selves, we should not be bounded. But if they shall
   fear, that at such, or such a time their peace and mirth have carryed
   them further then this moderation, then to take Jobs admirable Course,
   who sacrificed lest his Children should have transgressed in their
   mirth. So let them go, and find some poore afflicted soul, and there be
   bountifull, and liberall; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
   Those that the Parson findes in the military state, he fortifyes, and
   strengthens; with his utmost skill. Now in those that are tempted,
   whatsoever is unruly, falls upon two heads; either they think, that
   there is none that can or will look after things, but all goes by
   chance, or wit: Or else, though there be a great Governour of all
   things, yet to them he is lost, as if they said, God doth forsake and
   persecute them, and there is none to deliver them. If the Parson
   suspect the first, and find sparkes of such thoughts now and then to
   break forth, then without opposing directly (for disputation is no Cure
   for Atheisme) he scatters in his discourse three sorts of arguments;
   the first taken from Nature, the second from the Law, the third from
   Grace. For Nature, he sees not how a house could be either built
   without a builder, or kept in repaire without a house-keeper. He
   conceives not possibly, how the windes should blow so much as they can,
   and the sea rage so much as it can, and all things do what they can,
   and all, not only without dissolution of the whole, but also of any
   part, by taking away so much as the usuall seasons of summer and
   winter, earing and harvest. Let the weather be what it will, still we
   have bread, though sometimes more, somtimes lesse; wherewith also a
   carefull Joseph might meet. He conceives not possibly, how he that
   would beleeve a Divinity, if he had been at the Creation of all things,
   should lesse beleeve it, seeing the Preservation of all things; For
   Preservation is a Creation; and more, it is a continued Creation, and a
   creation every moment. Secondly, for the Law, there may be so evident,
   though unused a proof of Divinity taken from thence, that the Atheist,
   or Epicurian can have nothing to contradict. The Jewes yet live, and
   are known: they have their Law and Language bearing witnesse to them,
   and they to it: they are Circumcised to this day, and expect the
   promises of the Scripture; their Countrey also is known, the places,
   and rivers travelled unto, and frequented by others, but to them an
   unpenetrable rock, an unaccessible desert. Wherefore if the Jewes live,
   all the great wonders of old live in them, and then who can deny the
   stretched out arme of a mighty God? especially since it may be a just
   doubt, whether, considering the stubbornnesse of the Nation, their
   living then in their Countrey under so many miracles were a stranger
   thing, then their present exile, and disability to live in their
   Countrey. And it is observable, that this very thing was intended by
   God, that the Jewes should be his proof, and witnesses, as he calls
   them, Isaiah 43. 12. And their very dispersion in all Lands, was
   intended not only for a punishment to them; but for an exciting of
   others by their sight, to the acknowledging of God and his power Psalm
   59. 11. And therefore this kind of Punishment was chosen rather then
   any other. Thirdly, for Grace. Besides the continuall succession (since
   the Gospell) of holy men, who have born witness to the truth, (there
   being no reason, why any should distrust Saint Luke, or Tertullian, or
   Chrysostome, more then Tully, Virgill, or Livy;) There are two
   Prophesies in the Gospel, which evidently argue Christs Divinity by
   their success: the one concerning the woman that spent the oyntment on
   our Saviour, for which he told, that it should never be forgotten, but
   with the Gospel it selfe be preached to all ages, Matth. 26. 13. The
   other concerning the destruction of Jerusalem; of which our Saviour
   said, that that generation should not passe, till all were fulfilled,
   Luke 21.32. Which Josephus's History confirmeth, and the continuance of
   which verdict is yet evident. To these might be added the Preaching of
   the Gospel in all Nations, Matthew 24. 14. which we see even
   miraculously effected in these new discoveryes, God turning mens
   Covetousnesse, and Ambitions to the effecting of his word. Now a
   prophesie is a wonder sent to Posterity, least they complaine of want
   of wonders. It is a letter sealed, and sent, which to the bearer is but
   paper, but to the receiver, and opener, is full of power. Hee that saw
   Christ open a blind mans eyes, saw not more Divinity, then he that
   reads the womans oyntment in the Gospell, or sees Jerusalem destroyed.
   With some of these heads enlarged, and woven into his discourse, at
   severall times and occasions, the Parson setleth wavering minds. But if
   he sees them neerer desperation, then Atheisme; not so much doubting a
   God, as that he is theirs; then he dives unto the boundlesse Ocean of
   Gods Love, and the unspeakeable riches of his loving kindnesse. He hath
   one argument unanswerable. If God hate them, either he doth it as they
   are Creatures, dust and ashes; or as they are sinfull. As Creatures, he
   must needs love them; for no perfect Artist ever yet hated his owne
   worke. As sinfull, he must much more love them; because notwithstanding
   his infinite hate of sinne, his Love overcame that hate; and with an
   exceeding great victory, which in the Creation needed not, gave them
   love for love, even the son of his love out of his bosome of love. So
   that man, which way soever he turnes, hath two pledges of Gods Love,
   that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be
   established; the one in his being, the other in his sinfull being: and
   this as the more faulty in him, so the more glorious in God. And all
   may certainly conclude, that God loves them, till either they despise
   that Love, or despaire of his Mercy: not any sin else, but is within
   his Love; but the despising of Love must needs be without it. The
   thrusting away of his arme makes us onely not embraced.

   CHAP. XXXV. The Parson's Condescending.

   THe Countrey Parson is a Lover of old Customes, if they be good, and
   harmlesse; and the rather, because Countrey people are much addicted to
   them, so that to favour them therein is to win their hearts, and to
   oppose them therin is to deject them. If there be any ill in the
   custome, that may be severed from the good, he pares the apple, and
   gives them the clean to feed on. Particularly, he loves Procession, and
   maintains it, because there are contained therein 4 manifest
   advantages. First, a blessing of God for the fruits of the field:
   Secondly, justice in the Preservation of bounds: Thirdly, Charity in
   loving walking, and neighbourly accompanying one another, with
   reconciling of differences at that time, if there be any: Fourthly,
   Mercy in releeving the poor by a liberall distribution and largesse,
   which at that time is, or ought to be used. Wherefore he exacts of all
   to bee present at the perambulation, and those that withdraw, and sever
   themselves from it, he mislikes, and reproves as uncharitable, and
   unneighbourly; and if they will not reforme, presents them. Nay, he is
   so farre from condemning such assemblies, that he rather procures them
   to be often, as knowing that absence breedes strangeness, but presence
   love. Now Love is his business, and aime; wherefore he likes well, that
   his Parish at good times invite one another to their houses, and he
   urgeth them to it: and somtimes, where he knowes there hath been or is
   a little difference, hee takes one of the parties, and goes with him to
   the other, and all dine or sup together. There is much preaching in
   this friendliness. Another old Custome there is of saying, when light
   is brought in, God send us the light of heaven; And the Parson likes
   this very well; neither is he affraid of praising, or praying to God at
   all times, but is rather glad of catching opportunities to do them.
   Light is a great Blessing, and as great as food, for which we give
   thanks: and those that thinke this superstitious, neither know
   superstition, nor themselves. As for those that are ashamed to use this
   forme, as being old, and obsolete, and not the fashion, he reformes,
   and teaches them, that at Baptisme they professed not to be ashamed of
   Christs Cross, or for any shame to leave that which is good. He that is
   ashamed in small things, will extend his pusillanimity to is greater.
   Rather should a Christian Souldier take such occasions to harden
   himseife, and to further his exercises of Mortification.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAP. XXXVI. The Parson Blessing.

   THe Countrey Parson wonders, that Blessing the people is in so little
   use with his brethren: whereas he thinks it not onely a grave, and
   reverend thing, but a beneficial also. Those who use it not, do so
   either out of niceness, because they like the salutations, and
   complements, and formes of worldly language better; which conformity
   and fashionableness is so exceeding unbefitting a Minister, that it
   deserves reproof, not refutation: Or else, because they think it empty
   and superfluous. But that which the Apostles used so diligently in
   their writings, nay, which our Saviour himselfe used, Marke IO. 16,
   cannot bee vain and superfluous. But this was not proper to Christ, or
   the Apostles only, no more then to be a spirituall Father was
   appropriated to them. And if temporall Fathers bless their children,
   how much more may, and ought Spirituall Fathers? Besides, the Priests
   of the Old Testament were commanded to Blesse the people, and the forme
   thereof is prescribed, Numb. 6.[22-27.] Now as the Apostle argues in
   another case; if the Ministration of condemnation did bless, how shall
   not the ministration of the spirit exceed in blessing? The fruit of
   this blessing good Hannah found, and received with great joy, I Sam. I.
   18. though it came from a man disallowed by God: for it was not the
   person, but Priesthood, that blessed; so that even ill Priests may
   blesse. Neither have the Ministers power of Blessing only, but also of
   cursing. So in the Old TestamentElisha cursed the children, 2 Kin. 2.
   24. which though our Saviour reproved as unfitting for his particular,
   who was to shew all humility before his Passion, yet he allows in his
   Apostles. And therfore St. Peter used that fearfull imprecation to
   Simon Magus, Act. 8. [18-25]. Thy mony perish with thee: and the event
   confirmed it. So did St. Paul, 2 Tim. 4.14. and I Tim. I. 20. Speaking
   of Alexander the Coppersmith, who had withstood his preaching, The Lord
   (saith he) reward him according to his works. And again, of Hymeneus
   and Alexander, he saith, he had delivered them to Satan, that they
   might learn not to Blaspheme. The formes both of Blessing, & cursing
   are expounded in the Common-Prayer-book: the one in, The Grace of our
   Lord Jesus Christ, &c. and: The Peace of God, &c. The other in
   generall, in the Commination. Now blessing differs from prayer, in
   assurance, because it is not performed by way of request, but of
   confidence, and power, effectually applying Gods favour to the blessed,
   by the interesting of that dignity wherewith God hath invested the
   Priest, and ingaging of Gods own power and institution for a blessing.
   The neglect of this duty in Ministers themselves, hath made the people
   also neglect it; so that they are so far from craving this benefit from
   their ghostly Father, that they oftentimes goe out of church, before he
   hath blessed them. In the time of Popery, the Priests Benedicite, and
   his holy water were over highly valued; and now we are fallen to the
   clean contrary, even from superstition to coldnes, and Atheism. But the
   Parson first values the gift in himself, and then teacheth his parish
   to value it. And it is observable, that if a Minister talke with a
   great man in the ordinary course of complementing language, he shall be
   esteemed as ordinary complementers; but if he often interpose a
   Blessing, when the other gives him just opportunity, by speaking any
   good, this unusuall form begets a reverence, and makes him esteemed
   according to his Profession. The same is to be observed in writing
   Letters also. To conclude, if all men are to blesse upon occasion, as
   appears Rom. 12. 14. how much more those, who are spiritual Fathers?
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAP. XXXVII. Concerning detraction.

   THe Countrey Parson perceiving, that most, when they are at leasure,
   make others faults their entertainment and discourse, and that even
   some good men think, so they speak truth, they may disclose anothers
   fault, finds it somwhat difficult how to proceed in this point. For if
   he absolutely shut up mens mouths, and forbid all disclosing of faults,
   many an evill may not only be, but also spread in his Parish, without
   any remedy (which cannot be applyed without notice) to the dishonor of
   God, and the infection of his flock, and the discomfort, discredit, &
   hinderance of the Pastor. On the other side, if it be unlawful to open
   faults, no benefit or advantage can make it lawfull; for we must not do
   evill, that good may come of it. Now the Parson taking this point to
   task, which is so exceeding useful, and hath taken so deep roote, that
   it seems the very life and substance of Conversation, hath proceeded
   thus far in the discussing of it. Faults are either notorious, or
   private. Again notorious faults are either such as are made known by
   common fame (and of these, those that know them, may talk, so they do
   it not with sport, but commiseration;) or else such as have passed
   judgment, & been corrected either by whipping, or imprisoning, or the
   like. Of these also men may talk, and more, they may discover them to
   those that know them not: because infamy is a part of the sentence
   against malefactours, which the Law intends, as is evident by those,
   which are branded for rogues, that they may be known; or put into the
   stocks, that they may be looked upon. But some may say, though the Law
   allow this, the Gospel doth not, which hath so much advanced Charity,
   and ranked backbiters among the generation of the wicked, Rom. I. 30.
   But this is easily answered: As the executioner is not uncharitable,
   that takes away the life of the condemned, except besides his office,
   he add a tincture of private malice in the joy, and hast of acting his
   part; so neither is he that defames him, whom the Law would have
   defamed, except he also do it out of rancour. For in infamy, all are
   executioners, and the Law gives a malefactour to all to be defamed. And
   as malefactors may lose & forfeit their goods, or life; so may they
   their good name, and the possession thereof, which before their offence
   and Judgment they had in all mens brests: for all are honest, till the
   contrary be proved. Besides, it concerns the Common-Wealth, that Rogues
   should be known, and Charity to the publick hath the precedence of
   private charity. So that it is so far from being a fault to discover
   such offenders, that it is a duty rather, which may do much good, and
   save much harme. Neverthelesse, if the punished delinquent shall be
   much troubled for his sins, and turne quite another man, doubtlesse
   then also mens affections and words must turne, and forbear to speak of
   that, which even God himself hath forgotten.

   The Authour's Prayer before Sermon.

   O Almighty and ever-living Lord God! Majesty, and Power, and
   Brightnesse, and Glory! How shall we dare to appear before thy face,
   who are contrary to thee, in all we call thee? for we are darknesse,
   and weaknesse, and filthinesse, and shame. Misery and sin fill our
   days: yet art thou our Creatour, and we thy work: Thy hands both made
   us, and also made us Lords of all thy creatures; giving us one world in
   our selves, and another to serve us: then did'st thou place us in
   Paradise, and wert proceeding still on in thy Favours, untill we
   interrupted thy Counsels, disappointed thy Purposes, and sold our God,
   our glorious, our gracious God for an apple. O write it! O brand it in
   our foreheads for ever: for an apple once we lost our God, and still
   lose him for no more; for money, for meat, for diet: But thou Lord, art
   patience, and pity, and sweetnesse, and love; therefore we sons of men
   are not consumed. Thou hast exalted thy mercy above all things; and
   hast made our salvation, not our punishment, thy glory: so that then
   where sin abounded, not death, but grace superabounded; accordingly,
   when we had sinned beyond any help in heaven or earth, then thou
   saidest, Lo, I come! then did the Lord of life, unable of himselfe to
   die, contrive to do it. He took flesh, he wept, he died; for his
   enemies he died; even for those that derided him then, and still
   despise him. Blessed Saviour! Many waters could not quench thy love!
   nor no pit overwhelme it. But though the streams of thy bloud were
   currant through darknesse, grave, and hell; yet by these thy conflicts,
   and seemingly hazards, didst thou arise triumphant, and therein mad'st
   us victorious. Neither doth thy love yet stay here! for, this word of
   thy rich peace, and reconciliation, thou hast committed, not to
   Thunder, or Angels, but to silly and sinfull men: even to me, pardoning
   my sins, and bidding me go feed the people of thy love. Blessed be the
   God of Heaven and Earth! who onely doth wondrous things. Awake
   therefore, my Lute, and my Viol! awake all my powers to glorifie thee!
   We praise thee! we blesse thee! we magnifie thee for ever! And now, O
   Lord! in the power of thy Victories, and in the wayes of thy
   Ordinances, and in the truth of thy Love, Lo, we stand here, beseeching
   thee to blesse thy word, wherever spoken this day throughout the
   universall Church. O make it a word of power and peace, to convert
   those who are not yet thine, and to confirme those that are:
   particularly, blesse it in this thy own Kingdom, which thou hast made a
   Land of light, a store-house of thy treasures and mercies: O let not
   our foolish and unworthy hearts rob us of the continuance of this thy
   sweet love: but pardon our sins, and perfect what thou hast begun. Ride
   on Lord, because of the word of truth, and meeknesse. and
   righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
   Especially, blesse this portion here assembled together, with thy
   unworthy Servant speaking unto them: Lord Jesu! teach thou me, that I
   may teach them; Sanctifie, and inable all my powers, that in their full
   strength they may deliver thy message reverently, readily, faithfully,
   & fruitfully. O make thy word a swift word, passing from the ear to the
   heart, from the heart to the life and conversation: that as the rain
   returns not empty, so neither may thy word, but accomplish that for
   which it is given. O Lord hear, O Lord forgive! O Lord, hearken. and do
   so for thy blessed Son's sake, in whose sweet and pleasing words, we
   say, Our Father, &c.
     __________________________________________________________________

   A Prayer after Sermon.

   BLessed be God! and the Father of all mercy! who continueth to pour his
   benefits upon us. Thou hast elected us, thou hast called us, thou hast
   justified us, sanctified, and glorified us: Thou wast born for us, and
   thou livedst and diedst for us: Thou hast given us the blessings of
   this life, and of a better. O Lord! thy blessings hang in clusters,
   they come trooping upon us! they break forth like mighty waters on
   every side. And now Lord, thou hast fed us with the bread of life: so
   man did eat Angels food: O Lord, blesse it: O Lord, make it health and
   strength unto us; still striving &prospering so long within us, untill
   our obedience reach the measure of thy love, who hast done for us as
   much as may be. Grant this dear Father, for thy Son's sake, our only
   Saviour: To whom with thee, and the Holy Ghost, three Persons, but one
   most glorious, incomprehensible God, be ascribed all Honour, and Glory,
   and Praise, ever. Amen.
