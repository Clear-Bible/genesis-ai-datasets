   COMMENTARY

   ON A

   HARMONY OF THE EVANGELISTS
     __________________________________________________________________

   MARK 6:12-13; LUKE 9:6

   Mark 6:12-13

   Luke 9:6

   12. And they departed, and preached [1] that men should repent. 13. And
   they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many diseased persons,
   and healed them.

   6. And they departed, and we went round about through the villages [2]
   preaching the Gospel, and healing everywhere.


   Mark 6:12. And they departed, and preached. Matthew silently passes
   over what the Apostles did. Mark and Luke relate that they proceeded to
   execute the commission which they had received; and from their
   statements it appears more clearly, that the office which Christ at
   that time bestowed upon them, as I have formerly mentioned, was
   temporary, and indeed lasted but a few days. They tell us that the
   Apostles went through the cities and villages: and they unquestionably
   returned in a short time to their Master, as we shall find to be stated
   in another passage.

   The only matter that requires exposition here is the fact related by
   Mark, that they anointed with oil many diseased persons Christ having
   conferred on them the power of healing, it is asked, why did they apply
   oil? Some learned persons suppose that it was a sort of medicine; and I
   acknowledge that in these countries the use of oil was very common. But
   nothing is more unreasonable than to imagine, that the Apostles
   employed ordinary and natural remedies, which would have the effect of
   obscuring the miracles of Christ. They were not instructed by our Lord
   in the art and science of healing, but, on the contrary, were enjoined
   to perform miracles which would arouse all Judea. I think, therefore,
   that this anointing was a visible token of spiritual grace, by which
   the healing that was administered by them was declared to proceed from
   the secret power of God; for under the Law oil was employed to
   represent the grace of the Spirit. The absurdity of an attempt to
   imitate the Apostles, by making the anointing of the sick a perpetual
   ordinance of the Church, appears from the fact, that Christ bestowed on
   the Apostles the gift of healing, not as an inheritance which they
   should hand down to posterity, but as a temporary seal of the doctrine
   of the Gospel. In our own day, the ignorance of the Papists is
   exceedingly ridiculous in maintaining that their nasty unction, [3] by
   which they hurry to the grave persons who are fast dying, is a
   Sacrament.

   MATTHEW 11:1-6; LUKE 7:18-23

   Matthew 11:1-6

   Luke 7:18-23

   1. And it happened that when Jesus had made an end of commanding his
   twelve disciples, [4] he departed thence to teach and to preach in
   their cities. 2. Now when John had heard in the prison the works of
   Christ, he sent two of his disciples, 3. And said to him, Art thou he
   who was to come, or do we look for another? 4. And Jesus answering said
   to them, Go and relate to John those things which you hear and see.
   5. The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk; the lepers are
   cleansed, and the deaf hear; the dead are raised up, and the poor
   receive the message of the Gospel. [5] 6. And blessed is he who shall
   not be offended at me.

   18. And the disciples of John informed him of all these things; 19. And
   John called to him two of his disciples and sent them to Jesus, saying,
   Art thou he who was to come, or do we look for another? (Shortly
   afterwards.) 21. And in the same hour he cured many of diseases and
   plagues, and evil spirits, and to many who were blind he gave sight.
   22. And he answering said to them, Go and relate to John those things
   which you have heard and seen, that the blind see, the lame walk, the
   lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise again, to the poor
   the Gospel is preached. 23. And blessed is he who shall not be offended
   at me. [6]


   Matthew 11:1. And it happened that when Jesus had made an end In this
   passage Matthew means nothing more than that Christ did not desist from
   the exercise of his office, while the Apostles were laboring in another
   direction. As soon, therefore, as he sent them away, with the necessary
   instructions, to perambulate Judea, he performed the duties of a
   teacher in Galilee. The word commanding, which Matthew employs, is
   emphatic; for he means that they did not receive a commission to do
   what they pleased, but were restricted and enjoined as to the
   statements which they should make, and the manner in which they should
   conduct themselves.

   2. Now when John had heard. The Evangelists do not mean that John was
   excited by the miracles to acknowledge Christ at that time as Mediator;
   but, perceiving that Christ had acquired great reputation, and
   concluding that this was a fit and seasonable time for putting to the
   test his own declaration concerning him, he sent to him his disciples.
   The opinion entertained by some, that he sent them partly on his own
   account, is exceedingly foolish; as if he had not been fully convinced,
   or obtained distinct information, that Jesus is the Christ. Equally
   absurd is the speculation of those who imagine that the Baptist was
   near death, and therefore inquired what message he should carry, from
   Christ's mouth as it were, to the deceased fathers. It is very evident
   that the holy herald of Christ, perceiving that he was not far from the
   end of his journey, and that his disciples, though he had bestowed
   great pains in instructing them, still remained in a state of
   hesitation, resorted to this last expedient for curing their weakness.
   He had faithfully labored, as I have said, that his disciples should
   embrace Christ without delay. His continued entreaties had produced so
   little effect, that he had good reason for dreading that, after his
   death, they would entirely fall away; and therefore he earnestly
   attempted to arouse them from their sloth by sending them to Christ.
   Besides, the pastors of the Church are here reminded of their duty.
   They ought not to endeavor to bind and attach disciples to themselves,
   but to direct them to Christ, who is the only Teacher. From the
   beginning, John had openly avowed that he was not the bridegroom, (John
   3:29.) As the faithful friend of the bridegroom he presents the bride
   chaste and uncontaminated to Christ, who alone is the bridegroom of the
   Church. Paul tells us that he kept the same object in view, (2
   Corinthians 11:2,) and the example of both is held out for imitation to
   all the ministers of the Gospel.

   3. Art thou he who was to come? John takes for granted what the
   disciples had known from their childhood; for it was the first lesson
   of religion, and common among all the Jews, that Christ was to come,
   bringing salvation and perfect happiness. On this point, accordingly,
   he does not raise a doubt, but only inquires if Jesus be that promised
   Redeemer; for, having been persuaded of the redemption promised in the
   Law and the Prophets, they were bound to receive it when exhibited in
   the person of Christ. He adds, Do we look for another? By this
   expression, he indirectly glances at their sloth, which allowed them,
   after having been distinctly informed, to remain so long in doubt and
   hesitation. At the same time, he shows what is the nature and power of
   faith. Resting on the truth of God, it does not gaze on all sides, does
   not vary, but is satisfied with Christ alone, and will not be turned to
   another.

   4. Go and relate to John As John had assumed for the time a new
   character, so Christ enjoins them to carry to him that message, which
   more properly ought to have been addressed to his disciples. He gives
   an indirect reply, and for two reasons: first, because it was better
   that the thing should speak for itself; and, secondly, because he thus
   afforded to his herald a larger subject of instruction. Nor does he
   merely supply him with bare and rough materials in the miracles, but
   adapts the miracles to his purpose by quotations from the Prophets. He
   notices more particularly one passage from the 35th, and another from
   the 61st, chapter of Isaiah, for the purpose of informing John's
   disciples, that what the Prophets declared respecting the reign of
   Christ was accomplished and fulfilled. The former passage contains a
   description of Christ's reign, under which God promises that he will be
   so kind and gracious as to grant relief and assistance for every kind
   of disease. He speaks, no doubt, of spiritual deliverance from all
   diseases and remedies; but under outward symbols, as has been already
   mentioned, Christ shows that he came as a spiritual physician to cure
   souls. The disciples would consequently go away without any hesitation,
   having obtained a reply which was clear and free from all ambiguity.

   The latter passage resembles the former in this respect. It shows that
   the treasures of the grace of God would be exhibited to the world in
   Christ, and declares that Christ is expressly set apart for the poor
   and afflicted. This passage is purposely quoted by Christ, partly to
   teach all his followers the first lesson of humility, and partly to
   remove the offense which the flesh and sense might be apt to raise
   against his despicable flock. We are by nature proud, and scarcely
   anything is much valued by us, if it is not attended by a great degree
   of outward show. But the Church of Christ is composed of poor men, and
   nothing could be farther removed from dazzling or imposing ornament.
   Hence many are led to despise the Gospel, because it is not embraced by
   many persons of eminent station and exalted rank. How perverse and
   unjust that opinion is, Christ shows from the very nature of the
   Gospel, since it was designed only for the poor and despised. Hence it
   follows, that it is no new occurrence, or one that ought to disturb our
   minds, if the Gospel is despised by all the great, who, puffed up with
   their wealth, have no room to spare for the grace of God. Nay, if it is
   rejected by the greater part of men, there is no reason to wonder; for
   there is scarcely one person in a hundred who does not swell with
   wicked confidence. As Christ here guards his Gospel against contempt,
   he likewise reminds us who they are that are qualified to appreciate
   the grace of salvation which it offers to them; and in this manner,
   kindly inviting wretched sinners to the hope of salvation, raises them
   to full confidence.

   5. The poor receive the message of the Gospel By the poor are
   undoubtedly meant those whose condition is wretched and despicable, and
   who are held in no estimation. However mean any person may be, his
   poverty is so far from being a ground of despair, that it ought rather
   to animate him with courage to seek Christ. But let us remember that
   none are accounted poor but those who are really such, or, in other
   words, who lie low and overwhelmed by a conviction of their poverty.

   6. And blessed is he who shall not be offended in me. By this
   concluding statement Christ intended to remind them, that he who would
   adhere firmly and steadfastly to the faith of the Gospel must encounter
   offenses, which will tend to interrupt the progress of faith. This is
   said by way of anticipation, to fortify us against offenses; for we
   shall never want reasons for rejecting it, until our minds are raised
   above every offense. The first lesson, therefore, to be learned is,
   that we must contend with offenses, if we would continue in the faith
   of Christ; for Christ himself is justly denominated a

   rock of offense and stone of stumbling, by which many fall,
   (1 Peter 2:8.)

   This happens, no doubt, through our own fault, but that very fault is
   remedied, when he pronounces those to be blessed who shall not be
   offended in him; from which too we infer, that unbelievers have no
   excuse, though they plead the existence of innumerable offenses. For
   what hinders them from coming to Christ? Or what drives them to revolt
   from Christ? It is because he appears with his cross, disfigured and
   despised, and exposed to the reproaches of the world; because he calls
   us to share in his afflictions; because his glory and majesty, being
   spiritual, are despised by the world; and in a word, because his
   doctrine is totally at variance with our senses. Again, it is because,
   through the stratagems of Satan, many disturbances arise, with the view
   of slandering and rendering hateful the name of Christ and the Gospel;
   and because every one, as if on purpose, rears up a mass of offenses,
   being instigated by not less malignity than zeal to withdraw from
   Christ. [7]

   MATTHEW 11:7-15; LUKE 7:24-28

   Matthew 11:7-15

   Luke 7:24-28

   7. And as they were departing, Jesus began to say to the multitudes
   concerning John, What went you out into the wilderness to see? A reed,
   which is shaken by the wind? 8. But what went you out to see? A man
   clothed in soft raiment? [8] Lo, they who wear soft clothing are in the
   houses of kings. 9. But what went you out to see? A Prophet? Yea, I say
   to you, and higher than a Prophet. 10. For this is he of whom it is
   written, Lo, I send my messenger before thy face, who will prepare the
   way before thee. 11. Verily, I say to you, Among those who are born of
   women, there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist: yet he
   who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 12. And from
   the days of John the Baptist to this day, the kingdom of heaven
   suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. 13. For all the
   Prophets and the Law itself prophesied until John. 14. And if you are
   willing to receive it, [9] he is Elijah, who was to come. 15. He that
   hath ears to hear, let him hear.


   24. And when the messengers of John had departed, he began to say to
   the multitude concerning John, What went you out into the wilderness to
   see? A reed, which is shaken by the wind? 25. But what went you out to
   see? A man clothed with soft garments? [10] Lo, they that live in
   magnificent attire, and in delicacies, are in the courts of kings.
   26. But what went you out to see? A Prophet? Yea, I say to you, and
   more than a Prophet. 27. It is he of whom it is written, Lo, I send my
   messenger [11] before my face, who will prepare the way before thee.
   28. For I say to you, Among those who are born of women, there is not a
   great Prophet than John the Baptist; yet he that is least in the
   kingdom of God is greater than he.

   Luke 16:16

   16. The Law and the Prophets (were) till John: since that time the
   kingdom of God is preached, and all press violently into it.



   Matthew 11:7. And while they were departing Christ praises John before
   the people, in order that they may state from recollection what they
   have heard from him, and may give credit to his testimony. For his name
   was widely celebrated, and men spoke of him in lofty terms: but his
   doctrine was held in less estimation, and there were even few that
   waited on his ministrations. Christ reminds them, that those who went
   out to see him in the wilderness lost their pains, if they did not
   devoutly apply their minds and faculties to his doctrine. The meaning
   of the words, you went out into the wilderness, is this: "Your journey
   would have been an act of foolish and ridiculous levity, if you had not
   a fixed object in view. But it was neither worldly splendor nor any
   sort of amusement [12] that you were in quest of: your design was, to
   hear the voice of God from the mouth of the Prophet. If therefore you
   would reap advantage from your undertaking, it is necessary that what
   he spoke should remain fixed in your memory."

   8. Clothed with soft garments Those who think that Christ here condemns
   the extravagance of a court are mistaken. There are many other passages
   in which luxury of dress, and excessive attention to outward
   appearance, are censured. But this passage simply means, that there was
   nothing in the wilderness to attract the people from every quarter;
   that every thing there was rude and unpolished, and fitted only to
   inspire disgust; and that such elegance of dress as delights the eyes
   is rather to be looked for in the courts of kings. [13]

   11. Verily I say to you These words not only maintain the authority of
   John, but elevate his doctrine above the ancient prophets, that the
   people may keep in view the right end of his ministry; for they mistook
   the design of his mission, and, in consequence of this, derived almost
   no advantage from his discourses. Accordingly, Christ extols and places
   him above the rank of the prophets, and gives the people to understand
   that he had received a special and more excellent commission. When he
   elsewhere says respecting himself that he was not a Prophet, (John
   1:21,) this is not inconsistent with the designation here bestowed upon
   him by Christ. He was, no doubt, a Prophet, like others whom God had
   appointed in his Church to be expounders of the Law, and messengers of
   his will; but he was more excellent than the Prophets in this respect,
   that he did not, like them, make known redemption at a distance and
   obscurely under shadows, but proclaimed that the time of redemption was
   now manifest and at hand. Such too is the import of Malachi's
   prediction, (Malachi 3:1,) which is immediately added, that the
   pre-eminence of John consisted in his being the herald and forerunner
   of Christ; [14] for although the ancient Prophets spoke of his kingdom,
   they were not, like John, placed before his face, to point him out as
   present. As to the other parts of the passage, the reader may consult
   what has been said on the first chapter of Luke's Gospel. [15]

   There hath not arisen Our Lord proceeds farther, and declares that the
   ministers of the Gospel will be as far superior to John as John was
   superior to the Prophets. Those who think that Christ draws a
   comparison between himself and John have fallen into a strange blunder;
   for nothing is said here about personal rank, but commendation is
   bestowed on the pre-eminence of office. This appears more clearly from
   the words employed by Luke, there is not a greater Prophet; for they
   expressly restrict his eminence to the office of teaching. In a word,
   this magnificent eulogium is bestowed on John, that the Jews may
   observe more attentively the commission which he bore. Again, the
   teachers who were afterwards to follow are placed above him, to show
   the surpassing majesty of the Gospel above the Law, and above that
   preaching which came between them. Now, as Christ intended to prepare
   the Jews for receiving the Gospel, we ought also, in the present day,
   to be aroused to listen with reverence to Christ speaking to us from
   the lofty throne of his heavenly glory; lest he take revenge for our
   contempt of him by that fearful curse which he pronounces on
   unbelievers by Malachi in the same passage.

   The kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of God denote the new condition
   of the Church, as in other passages which have already occurred; for it
   was promised that at the coming of Christ all things would be restored.
   He that is least in the kingdom. The Greek word mikroteros, which I
   have rendered least, is in the comparative degree, and signifies less;
   but the meaning is more clearly brought out, that all the ministers of
   the Gospel are included. Many of them undoubtedly have received a small
   portion of faith, and are therefore greatly inferior to John; but this
   does not prevent their preaching from being superior to his, because it
   holds out Christ as having rendered complete and eternal satisfaction
   by his one sacrifice, as the conqueror of death and the Lord of life,
   and because it withdraws the veil, and elevates believers to the
   heavenly sanctuary.

   12. Since the days of John I have no doubt that Christ speaks honorably
   of the majesty of the Gospel on this ground, that many sought after it
   with warm affection; for as God had raised up John to be the herald of
   the kingdom of his Son, so the Spirit infused such efficacy into his
   doctrine, that it entered deeply into the hearts of men and kindled
   that zeal. It appears, therefore, that the Gospel, which comes forward
   in a manner so sudden and extraordinary, [16] and awakens powerful
   emotions, must have proceeded from God. But in the second clause is
   added this restriction, that the violent take it by force The greater
   part of men were no more excited than if the Prophets had never uttered
   a word about Christ, or if John had never appeared as his witness; and
   therefore Christ reminds them, that the violence, of which he had
   spoken, existed only in men of a particular class. The meaning
   therefore is, A vast assembly of men is now collected, as if men were
   rushing violently forward to seize the kingdom of God; for, aroused by
   the voice of one man, they come together in crowds, and receive, not
   only with eagerness, but with vehement impetuosity, the grace which is
   offered to them. Although very many are asleep, and are no more
   affected than if John in the wilderness were acting a play which had no
   reference to them, yet many flock to him with ardent zeal. The tendency
   of our Lord's statement is to show, that those who pass by in a
   contemptuous manner, and as it were with closed eyes, the power of God,
   which manifestly appears both in the teacher and in the hearers, are
   inexcusable. Let us also learn from these words, what is the true
   nature and operation of faith. It leads men not only to give, cold and
   indifferent assent when God speaks, but to cherish warm affection
   towards Him, and to rush forward as it were with a violent struggle.

   Luke 16:16. The Law and the Prophets were till John Our Lord had said
   that the earnestness of the people was a prelude to those things which
   the Prophets had foretold as to the future renovation of the Church. He
   now compares the ministry of John to the Law and the Prophets "It is
   not wonderful," he tells us, "that God should now act so powerfully on
   the minds of men; for he is not as formerly, seen at a distance under
   dark shadows, but appears openly and at hand for the establishment of
   his kingdom." Hence it follows, that those who obstinately reject
   John's doctrine are less excusable than those who despised the Law and
   the Prophets

   Matthew 11:13. All the Prophets and the Law itself Prophesied. The word
   prophesied is emphatic; for the Law and the Prophets did not present
   God before the eyes of men, but represented him under figures and
   shadows as absent. The comparison, we now perceive, is intended to
   show, that it is highly criminal in men to remain indifferent, when
   they have obtained a manifestation of the presence of God, who held his
   ancient people in suspense by predictions. Christ does not class John
   with the ministers of the Gospel, though he formerly assigned to him an
   intermediate station between them and the Prophets. But there is no
   inconsistency here: for although John's preaching was a part of the
   Gospel, it was little more than a first lesson.

   14. And if you are willing to receive it He now explains more clearly
   in what manner John began to preach the kingdom of God It was in the
   character of that Elijah, who was to be sent before the face of God,
   (Malachi 4:5.) Our Lord's meaning therefore is, that the great and
   dreadful day of the Lord, which Malachi described, is now beheld by the
   Jews, when Elijah, who was there promised, discharges his office as a
   herald. Again, by this exception, if you are willing to receive it, he
   glances at their hardened obstinacy, in maliciously shutting their eyes
   against the clearest light. But will he cease to be Elijah, if he shall
   not be received? Christ does not mean that John's official character
   [17] depends on their approbation; but having declared that he is
   Elijah, he charges them with carelessness and ingratitude, if he does
   not obtain that respect to which he is entitled.

   15. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. We know that it is
   customary with Christ to introduce this sentence, whenever he treats of
   subjects which are highly important, and which deserve no ordinary
   attention. [18] He reminds us, at the same time, of the reason why the
   mysteries of which he speaks are not received by all. It is because
   many of his hearers are deaf, or at least have their ears closed. But
   now, as every man is hindered not only by his own unbelief, but by the
   mutual influence which men exercise on each other, Christ here exhorts
   the elect of God, whose ears have been pierced, to consider attentively
   this remarkable secret of God, and not to remain deaf with unbelievers.

   29. And all the people hearing, and the publicans, justified God,
   having been baptized with the baptism of John. [20] 30. But Pharisees
   and Lawyers [21] despised [22] the counsel of God in themselves, [23]
   having not been baptized by him. 31. And the Lord said, To what then
   shall I compare the men of this generation? and to what are they like?
   32. They are like children sitting in the market-place, and calling out
   to each other, and saying, We have played on the flute to you, and you
   have not danced; we have sung mournful airs to you, and you have not
   wept. 33. For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking
   wine, and you say, He hath a devil. 34. The Son of man came eating and
   drinking, and you say, Lo, a man gluttonous and a wine-bibber, a friend
   to publicans and sinners. [24] 35. And Wisdom is justified by all her
   children.



   Luke 7:29. And all the people hearing. This part is left out by
   Matthew, though it throws no small light on the connection of the
   words; for it was this circumstance which gave rise to Christ's
   expostulation, when he perceived that the scribes persisted so
   obstinately in despising God. The substance of this passage is, that
   the common people and the publicans gave glory to God; while the
   Scribes, flattering themselves with confidence in their own knowledge,
   cared little for what Christ said. At first sight, this tends only to
   obscure, and even to disfigure, the glory of the Gospel, that Christ
   could not gather disciples to himself, except from the dregs and
   offscourings of the people; while he was rejected by those who had any
   reputation for holiness or learning. But the Lord intended, from the
   beginning, to hold out this example, that neither the men of that age,
   nor even posterity, might judge of the Gospel by the approbation of
   men; for we are all by nature inclined to this vice. And yet nothing is
   more unreasonable than to submit the truth of God to the judgment of
   men, whose acuteness and sagacity amounts to nothing more than mere
   vanity. Accordingly, as Paul says, "God hath chosen that part which is
   weak and foolish in the eyes of the world, that he may cast down from
   its height whatever appears to be mighty and wise," (1 Corinthians
   1:27.) Our duty is to prefer this foolishness of God, to use Paul's
   expression, (1 Corinthians 1:25,) to all the display of human wisdom.

   Justified God. This is a very remarkable expression. Those who
   respectfully embrace the Son of God, and assent to the doctrine which
   he has brought, are said to ascribe righteousness to God. We need not
   therefore wonder, if the Holy Spirit everywhere honors faith with
   remarkable commendations, assigns to it the highest rank in the worship
   of God, and declares that it is a very acceptable service. For what
   duty can be deemed more sacred than to vindicate God's righteousness?
   The word justify applies generally, no doubt, to every thing connected
   with the praises of God, and conveys the idea, that God is beheld with
   approbation, and crowned with glory, by the people who embrace that
   doctrine of which He is the author. Now, since faith justifies God, it
   is impossible, on the other hand, but that unbelief must be blasphemy
   against him, and a disdainful withholding of that praise which is due
   to his name. This expression also teaches us, that men are never
   brought into complete subjection to the faith until, disregarding the
   flesh and sense, they conclude that every thing which comes from God is
   just and holy, and do not permit themselves to murmur against his word
   or his works.

   Having been baptized with the baptism of John. Luke means that the
   fruits of the baptism which they had received were then beginning to
   appear; for it was a useful preparation to them for receiving the
   doctrine of Christ. It was already an evidence of their piety that they
   presented themselves to be baptized. Our Lord now leads them forward
   from that slender instruction to a higher degree of progress, as the
   scribes, in despising the baptism of John, shut against themselves,
   through their pride, the gate of faith. If, therefore, we desire to
   rise to full perfection, let us first guard against despising the very
   least of God's invitations, [25] and be prepared in humility to
   commence with small and elementary instructions. Secondly, let us
   endeavor that, if our faith shall have a feeble beginning, it may
   regularly and gradually increase.

   30. Despised the counsel of God within themselves. The counsel of God
   is mentioned by way of respect, as contrasted with the wicked pride of
   the scribes; for the term counsel carries along with it a dignity,
   which protects the doctrine of God against the contempt of men.
   Literally, Luke says, that they despised Against Themselves: and indeed
   I do not disapprove of the meaning which is preferred by some, that the
   scribes were rebellious to their own destruction. But as Luke's
   narrative is simple, and as the preposition eis is often used in the
   sense of en I have chosen rather to translate it, within themselves; as
   meaning, that although they did not openly and expressly contradict,
   yet as they inwardly swelled with hidden pride, they despised within
   themselves

   31. To what shall I compare? He does not include all the men of his
   age, but speaks particularly of the scribes and their followers. He
   charges them with this reproach, that while the Lord endeavored, by
   various methods, to draw them to himself, they repelled his grace with
   incorrigible obstinacy. He employs a comparison, which was probably
   taken from a common amusement of children; for there is probability in
   the conjecture, that the children divided themselves into two bands,
   and sang in that manner. And, indeed, I think that, in order to abase
   the pride of the scribes, Christ intentionally borrowed from children
   the materials of his reproof: thus declaring that, however
   distinguished they were, nothing more was necessary to condemn them
   than a song which children were wont to sing in the market-place for
   their amusement.

   33. For John the Baptist came. Leading an austere life, he thundered
   out repentance and severe reproofs, and sung, as it were, a plaintive
   song; while the Lord endeavored, by a cheerful and sprightly song, to
   draw them more gently to the Father. Neither of those methods had any
   success, and what reason could be assigned except their hardened
   obstinacy? This passage also shows us, why so wide a difference
   existed, as to outward life, between Christ and the Baptist, though
   both had the same object in view. Our Lord intended, by this diversity,
   and by assuming as it were a variety of characters, to convict
   unbelievers more fully; since, while he yielded and accommodated
   himself to their manners, he did not bend them to himself. But if the
   men of that age are deprived of every excuse for repelling, with
   inveterate malice, a twofold invitation which God had given them, we
   too are held guilty in their persons; for God leaves not untried any
   sort of pleasing melody, or of plaintive and harsh music, to draw us to
   himself, and yet we remain hard as stones. They called John a demoniac,
   just as persons of unsound mind, or whose brain is disturbed, are
   usually called madmen.

   34. The Son of man came. To eat and drink means here nothing more than
   to live in the customary way; as Christ says that John came neither
   eating nor drinking, because he confined himself to a peculiar diet,
   and even abstained from ordinary food. This is more fully expressed by
   the words of Luke, neither eating bread nor drinking wine. Those who
   think that the highest perfection consists in outward austerity of
   life, and who pronounce it to be an angelical life when a person is
   abstemious, [26] or mortifies himself by fasting, ought to attend to
   this passage. On this principle John would rank higher than the Son of
   God; but, on the contrary, we ought to maintain, that

   bodily exercise profiteth little, but godliness
   is profitable to all things, (1 Timothy 4:8.)

   And yet we must not make this a pretense for giving a loose rein to the
   flesh, by indulging in luxuries and effeminacy: only we must beware of
   superstition, lest foolish men, imagining that perfection lies in
   matters of a purely elementary nature, neglect the spiritual worship of
   God. Besides, while Christ accommodated himself to the usages of
   ordinary life, he maintained a sobriety truly divine, and did not
   encourage the excesses of others by his dissimulation or by his
   example.

   35. And Wisdom is justified This passage is variously explained by
   commentators. Some maintain that Wisdom was acquitted by the Jews,
   because, conscious of guilt, and judges of their own unbelief, they
   were compelled to acknowledge, that the doctrine which they rejected
   was good and holy. By the children of Wisdom they understand the Jews
   who boasted of that title. Others think that it was spoken in irony:
   "It is in this manner that you approve of the Wisdom of God, of which
   you boast that you are the children?" But as the Greek preposition apo
   [27] does not properly relate to an agent, some explain it, that Wisdom
   is acquitted by her children, and is no longer under obligation to
   them, in the same manner as when an inheritance is transferred to
   another. Thus Paul says, that Christ was justified (dedikaiotai) from
   sin, (Romans 6:7,) because the curse of sin had no longer any power
   over him.

   Some interpret it more harshly, and with greater excess of freedom, to
   mean that Wisdom is estranged from her children But granting that this
   were the import of the Greek preposition, I look upon the other meaning
   as more appropriate, that Wisdom, however wickedly she may be slandered
   by her own sons, loses nothing of her worth or rank, but remains
   unimpaired. The Jews, and particularly the scribes, gave themselves out
   as children of the Wisdom of God; and yet, when they trod their mother
   under their feet, they not only flattered themselves amidst such
   heinous sacrilege, but desired that Christ should fall by their
   decision. Christ maintains, on the contrary, that, however wicked and
   depraved her children may be, Wisdom remains entire, and that the
   malice of those who wickedly and malignantly slander her takes nothing
   from her authority.

   I have not yet brought forward that meaning which appears to my own
   mind the most appropriate and natural. First, the words of Christ
   contain an implied contrast between true children and bastards, who
   hold but an empty title without the reality; and they amount to this:
   "Let those who haughtily boast of being the children of Wisdom proceed
   in their obstinacy: she will, notwithstanding, retain the praise and
   support of her own children. Accordingly, Luke adds a term of
   universality, by all her children; which means, that the reluctance of
   the scribes will not prevent all the elect of God from remaining
   steadfast in the faith of the Gospel. With respect to the Greek word
   apo, it undoubtedly has sometimes the same meaning as hupo. Not to
   mention other instances, there is a passage in Luke's Gospel, (17:25,)
   where Christ says, that he must suffer many things, kai
   apodokimasthonai apo tos geneas tautes, and be rejected By this
   generation. Everybody will admit, that the form of expression is the
   same as in the corresponding clause. [28] Besides, Chrysostom, whose
   native language was Greek, passes over this matter, as if there were no
   room for debate. Not only is this meaning more appropriate, but it
   corresponds to a former clause, in which it was said, that God was
   justified by the people, (v. 29.) Although many apostates may revolt
   from the Church of God, yet, among all the elect, who truly belong to
   the flock, the faith of the Gospel will always remain uninjured.

   Luke 10:1-12

   Luke 10:1-12

   1. And after these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and
   sent them two by two before his face into every city and place, to
   which he was to come 2. He said, therefore to them, The harvest is
   indeed abundant, but the laborers are few; pray ye, therefore, the Lord
   of the harvest to send out the laborers into his harvest 3. Go: behold,
   I send you as lambs among wolves. 4. Carry neither purse, nor bag nor
   shoes, and salute no man by the way. 5. Into whatsoever house you shall
   enter, first say, Peace be to this house. 6. And if the son of peace
   will remain upon it: but if not, it will return to you. 7. And remain
   in the same house eating and drinking those things which shall be given
   by them; [29] for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house
   to house. 8. And into whatsoever city you shall enter, and they shall
   receive you, eat those things which are set before you: 9. And cure the
   diseased who are in it, and say to them, The kingdom of God is nigh to
   you. 10. And in whatsoever city you shall enter, and they shall not
   receive you, go out into its streets and say, 11. Even the dust, which
   has cleaved to us from your city, we wipe off against you: yet know
   this, that the kingdom of God is nigh to you. 12. I say to you, That in
   that day it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that day.


   Luke 10:1. And after these things the Lord appointed That the Apostles
   had returned to Christ before these seventy were substituted in their
   room, may be inferred from many circumstances. The twelve, therefore,
   were sent to awaken in the Jews the hope of an approaching salvation.
   After their return, as it was necessary that higher expectation should
   be excited, others were sent in greater numbers, as secondary heralds,
   to spread universally in every place the report of Christ's coming.
   Strictly speaking, they received no commission, but were only sent by
   Christ as heralds, to prepare the minds of the people for receiving his
   doctrine. As to the number seventy, he appears to have followed that
   order to which the people had already been long accustomed. We must
   bear in mind what has been already said about the twelve Apostles, [30]
   that as this was the number of the tribes when the people were in a
   flourishing condition, so an equal number of apostles or patriarchs was
   chosen, to reassemble the members of the lacerated body, that the
   restoration of the Church might thus be complete.

   There was a similar reason for these seventy. We know that Moses,
   finding himself insufficient for the burden, took seventy judges to be
   associated with him in governing the people, (Exodus 18:22; 24:1.) But
   when the Jews returned from the Babylonish captivity, they had a
   council or sunedrion--which was corrupted into Sanedrin [31]
   --consisting of seventy-two judges. As usually happens with such
   numbers, when they spoke of the council, they called them only the
   seventy judges; and Philo assures us, that they were chosen out of the
   posterity of David, that there might be some remaining authority in the
   royal line. After various calamities, this was the finishing stroke,
   when Herod abolished that council, and thus deprived the people of a
   legitimate share in the government. Now as the return from Babylon
   prefigured a true and complete redemption, the reason why our Lord
   chooses seventy heralds of his coming appears to be, to hold out the
   restoration of their fallen state; and as the people were to be united
   under one head, he does not give them authority as judges, but only
   commands them to go before him, that he may possess the sole power. And
   sent them by two and two. He appears to have done so on account of
   their weakness. There was reason to fear, that individually they would
   not have the boldness necessary for the vigorous discharge of their
   office; and therefore, that they may encourage one another, they are
   sent by two and two

   2. The harvest is indeed abundant. I have explained this passage under
   the ninth chapter of Matthew; [32] but it was proper to insert it again
   in this place, because it is related for a different purpose. In order
   to stimulate his disciples the more powerfully to apply with diligence
   to their work, he declares that the harvest is abundant: and hence it
   follows, that their labor will not be fruitless, but that they will
   find, in abundance, opportunities of employment, and means of
   usefulness. He afterwards reminds them of dangers, contests, and
   annoyances, and bids them go and prepare themselves for traversing with
   speed the whole of Judea. [33] In short, he repeats the same
   injunctions which he had given to the Apostles; and, therefore, it
   would serve no good purpose to trouble the reader here with many words,
   since a full exposition of all these matters may be found in the
   passage already quoted. We may notice briefly, however, the meaning of
   that expression, salute no man by the way. It indicates extreme haste,
   when, on meeting a person in the way, we pass on without speaking to
   him, lest he should detain us even for a short time. Thus, when Elisha
   sent his servant to the Shunamite woman, he charged him not to salute
   any person whom he met:

   if thou meet any man, salute him not;
   and if any salute thee, answer not again, (2 Kings 4:31.)

   Christ does not intend that his disciples shall be so unkind [34] as
   not to deign to salute persons whom they meet, but bids them hasten
   forward, so as to pass by every thing that would detain them.

   7. Eating and drinking those things which they shall give you This is
   another circumstance expressly mentioned by Luke. By these words Christ
   not only enjoins them to be satisfied with ordinary and plain food, but
   allows them to eat at another man's table. Their plain and natural
   meaning is: "you will be at liberty to live at the expense of others,
   so long as you shall be on this journey; for it is proper that those
   for whose benefit you labor should supply you with food." Some think
   that they were intended to remove scruples of conscience, that the
   disciples might not find fault with any kind of food. [35] But nothing
   of this kind was intended, and it was not even his object to enjoin
   frugality, but merely to permit them to accept of a reward, by living,
   during this commission, at the expense of those by whom they were
   entertained.

   matthew 11:20-24; luke 10:13-16

   Matthew 11:20-24

   Luke 10:13-16

   20. Then he began to upbraid the cities, in which most of his mighty
   works were done, because they had not repented of crimes: 21. Woe to
   thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which
   have been done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have
   repented of their crimes long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 22. But I say
   to you, It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon [36] in the day of
   judgment than for you. 23. And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted even
   to heaven shall be cast down even to hell; for if the mighty works,
   which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have
   remained until this day. 24. But I say to you, That it will be more
   tolerable for the land of Sodom [37] in the day of judgment than for
   thee.


   13. Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! for if the might
   works, which have been done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon,
   they would have long ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
   14. But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment
   than for you. [38] 15. And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted even to
   heaven, shall be cast down even to hell. 16. He that heareth you
   heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that
   despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.



   Matthew 11:20. Then he began to upbraid. Luke states the time when, and
   the reason why, Christ uttered such invectives against those cities. It
   was while he was sending the disciples away into various parts of
   Judea, to proclaim, as they passed along, that the kingdom of God was
   at hand. Reflecting on the ingratitude of those among whom he had long
   discharged the office of a prophet, and performed many wonderful works,
   without any good result, he broke out into these words, announcing that
   the time was now come, when he should depart to other cities, having
   learned, by experience, that the inhabitants of the country adjoining
   that lake, among whom he had begun to preach the Gospel and perform
   miracles, were full of obstinacy and of desperate malice. But he says
   nothing about the doctrine, and reproaches them that his miracles had
   not led them to repent. [39] The object which our Lord had in view, in
   exhibiting those manifestations of his power, undoubtedly was to invite
   men to himself; but as all are by nature averse to him, it is necessary
   to begin with repentance. Chorazin and Bethsaida are well known to have
   been cities which were situated on the lake of Gennesareth.

   21. If those mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon. As Tyre and
   Sidon, in consequence of their proximity, were at that time abhorred
   for their ungodliness, pride, debauchery, and other vices, Christ
   employs this comparison for the express purpose of making a deeper and
   more painful impression on his Jewish countrymen. There was not one of
   them who did not look upon the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon as
   abominable despisers of God. It is, therefore, no small heightening of
   his curse, when Christ says, that there would have been more hope of
   reformation from those places in which there was no religion, than is
   to be seen in Judea itself.

   Lest any should raise thorny questions [40] about the secret decrees of
   God, we must remember, that this discourse of our Lord is accommodated
   to the ordinary capacity of the human mind. [41] Comparing the citizens
   of Bethsaida, and their neighbors, with the inhabitants of Tyre and
   Sidon, he reasons, not of what God foresaw would be done either by the
   one or by the other, but of what both parties would have done, so far
   as could be judged from the facts. The exceedingly corrupt morals and
   unrestrained debauchery of those cities might be ascribed to ignorance;
   for there the voice of God had never been heard, nor had miracles been
   performed, to warn them to repent. But in the cities of Galilee, which
   Christ upbraids, there was a display of very hardened obstinacy in
   despising miracles, of which they had seen a vast number without
   reaping any advantage. In short, the words of Christ convey nothing
   more than that the inhabitants of Chorazin and Bethsaida go beyond
   those of Tyre and Sidon in malice and incurable contempt of God.

   And yet we have no right to contend with God, for having passed by
   others of whom better hopes might have been entertained, and displaying
   his power before some who were extremely wicked and altogether
   desperate. Those on whom he does not bestow his mercy are justly
   appointed to perdition. If he withhold his word from some, and allow
   them to perish, while, in order to render others more inexcusable, he
   entreats and exhorts them, in a variety of ways, to repentance, who
   shall charge him, on this account, with injustice? Let us, therefore,
   aware of our own weakness, learn to contemplate this height and depth
   [42] with reverence; for it is intolerable fretfulness and pride that
   is manifested by those who cannot endure to ascribe praise to the
   righteousness of God, except so far as it comes within the reach of
   their senses, and who disdainfully reject those mysteries, which it was
   their duty to adore, simply because the reason of them is not fully
   evident.

   If the mighty works had been done. We have said that these words inform
   us concerning the right use of miracles, though they likewise include
   doctrine; for Christ did not remain silent, [43] while he was holding
   out to their view the power of the Father; but, on the contrary,
   miracles were added to the Gospel, that they might attend to what was
   spoken by Christ.

   In sackcloth and ashes Repentance is here described by outward signs,
   the use of which was at that time common in the Church of God: not that
   Christ attaches importance to that matter, but because he accommodates
   himself to the capacity of the common people. We know that believers
   are not only required to exercise repentance for a few days, but to
   cherish it incessantly till death. But there is no necessity, in the
   present day, for being clothed with sackcloth, and sprinkled with
   ashes; and, therefore, there is not always occasion for that outward
   profession of repentance, but only when, after some aggravated revolt,
   men turn to God. Sackcloth and ashes are, no doubt, indications of
   guilt, for the purpose of turning away the wrath of the Judge; [44] and
   therefore relate strictly to the beginning of conversion. But as men
   testify by this ceremony their sorrow and grief, it must be preceded by
   hatred of sin, fear of God, and mortification of the flesh, according
   to the words of Joel, (2:13,) Rend your hearts and not your garments.
   We now see the reason why sackcloth and ashes are mentioned by Christ
   along with repentance, when he speaks of Tyre and Sidon, to the
   inhabitants of which the Gospel could not have been preached, without
   condemning their past life, leaving nothing for them, but to betake
   themselves to the wretched apparel of criminals for the sake of humbly
   beseeching pardon. Such, too, is the reference of the word sitting,
   which is employed by Luke, Sitting in sackcloth and ashes; for it
   denotes "lying prostrate on the ground,"--a posture adapted to express
   the grief of wretched persons, as is evident from many passages of the
   Prophets.

   23. And thou, Capernaum. He expressly addresses the city of Capernaum,
   in which he had resided so constantly, that many supposed it to be his
   native place. It was indeed an inestimable honor, that the Son of God,
   when about to commence his reign and priesthood, had chosen Capernaum
   for the seat of his palace and sanctuary. And yet it was as deeply
   plunged in its filth, as if there had never been poured upon it a drop
   of Divine grace. On this account, Christ declares, that the punishment
   awaiting it will be the more dreadful, in proportion to the higher
   favors which it had received from God. It deserves our earnest
   attention in this passage, that the profanation of the gifts of God, as
   it involves sacrilege, will never pass unpunished; and that the more
   eminent any one is, he will be punished with the greater severity, if
   he shall basely pollute the gifts which God has bestowed upon him; and
   above all, an awful vengeance awaits us, if, after having received the
   spiritual gifts of Christ, we treat him and his Gospel with contempt.

   If they had been done in Sodom. We have already hinted, that Christ
   speaks after the manner of men, and does not bring forth, as from the
   heavenly sanctuary, [45] what God foresaw would happen if he had sent a
   Prophet to the inhabitants of Sodom. But if quarrelsome persons are not
   satisfied with this answer, every ground of objection is removed by
   this single consideration, that although God had a remedy in his power
   for saving the inhabitants of Sodom, yet in destroying them he was a
   just avenger. [46]

   Luke 10:16. He that heareth you heareth me. It is a mistake to suppose
   that this passage is a repetition of what we formerly met with in the
   Gospel of Matthew 10:40 he that receiveth you receiveth me [47] Then,
   Christ was speaking of persons, but now, of doctrine. The former
   receiving had a reference to offices of kindness; but now he recommends
   faith, which receives God in his Word. The general meaning is, that the
   godliness of men is ascertained by the obedience of faith; [48] and
   that those who reject the Gospel, though they may boast of being the
   most eminent of the worshippers of God, give evidence that they
   wickedly despise him.

   We must now attend to the design of Christ. As a considerable portion
   of the world foolishly estimates the Gospel according to the rank of
   men, and despises it because it is professed by persons of mean and
   despicable condition, our Lord here contradicts so perverse a judgment.
   Again, almost all are so proud, that they do not willingly submit to
   their equals, or to those whom they look down upon as inferior to them.
   God has determined, on the other hand, to govern his Church by the
   ministry of men, and indeed frequently selects the ministers of the
   Word from among the lowest dregs of the people. It was, therefore,
   necessary to support the majesty of the Gospel, that it might not
   appear to be degraded by proceeding from the lips of men.

   This is a remarkable commendation [49] of the outward ministry, when
   Christ declares, that whatever honor and respect is rendered to the
   preaching of men, provided that the preaching be faithful, God
   acknowledges as done to Himself. In two points of view, this
   recommendation is useful. Nothing ought to be a stronger encouragement
   to us to embrace the doctrine of the Gospel, than to learn that this is
   the highest worship of God, and a sacrifice of the sweetest odor, to
   hear him speaking by human lips, and to yield subjection to his word,
   which is brought to us by men, in the same manner as if he were
   descending from heaven or making known his will to us by angels. Again,
   our confidence is established, and all doubt is removed, when we learn,
   that the testimony of our salvation, when delivered to us by men whom
   God has sent, is not less worthy of credit, than if His voice resounded
   from heaven. To deter us, on the other hand, from despising the Gospel,
   he adds a severe threatening:

   He that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth
   him that sent me. Those who disdain to listen to ministers, however
   mean and contemptible they may be, offer an insult, not to men only,
   but to Christ himself, and to God the Father. While a magnificent
   eulogium is here pronounced on the rank of pastors, who honestly and
   faithfully discharge their office, it is absurd in the Pope and his
   clergy to take this as a pretense for cloaking their tyranny.
   Assuredly, Christ does not speak in such a manner, as to surrender into
   the hands of men the power which the Father has given him, but only to
   protect his Gospel against contempt. Hence it follows, that he does not
   transfer to the persons of men the honor which is due to himself, but
   only maintains that it cannot be separated from his Word. If the Pope
   wishes to be received, let him bring forward the doctrine by which he
   may be recognized as a minister of Christ; but so long as he continues
   to be what he now is, a mortal enemy of Christ, and destitute of all
   resemblance to the Apostles, let him cease to deck himself with
   borrowed feathers.

   Luke 10:17-20

   Luke 10:17-20

   17. And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils
   are subject to us in thy name. [50] 18. And he said to them, I beheld
   Satan falling from heaven like lightning. 19. Lo, I give you power to
   tread on serpents and scorpions, and on all the power of the enemy, and
   nothing shall hurt you. 20. Nevertheless, rejoice not in this, that the
   spirits are subject to you; but rejoice, because your names are written
   in heaven.


   17. And the seventy returned. It is evident, that the faith of the
   seventy disciples in the words of Christ had not been full and
   complete, when they returned, exulting over it as a thing new and
   unexpected, that they had cast out devils by the power of Christ. Nay,
   they had received this power accompanied by a command. At the same
   time, I have no doubt that, when they departed, they were convinced
   that nothing which the Master had said to them would fail of its
   accomplishment; but afterwards, when the matter proceeded to an extent
   which surpassed their expectations, they were astonished at the sight.
   [51] And this is frequently the case with believers, that they receive
   from the word but a slight perception of the Divine power, and are
   afterwards excited to admiration by actual experience. What was the
   nature of that joy will more clearly appear from Christ's reply.

   18. I beheld Satan From one instance Christ leads them to the whole
   class; for he commanded his Gospel to be published for the very purpose
   of overturning Satan's kingdom. [52] So then, while the disciples
   rested solely on that demonstration which they had obtained from
   experience, Christ reminds them, that the power and efficacy of their
   doctrine extends farther, and that its tendency is to extirpate the
   tyranny which Satan exercises over the whole human race. We have now
   ascertained the meaning of the words. When Christ commanded that his
   Gospel should be preached, he did not at all attempt a matter of
   doubtful result, but foresaw the approaching ruin of Satan. [53] Now
   since the Son of God cannot be deceived, and this exercise of his
   foresight relates to the whole course of the Gospel, we have no reason
   to doubt, that whenever he raises up faithful teachers, he will crown
   their labor with prosperous success.

   Hence we infer, that our deliverance from the bondage of Satan is
   effected in no other way than through the Gospel; and that those only
   make actual proficiency in the Gospel, in whom Satan loses his power,
   so that sin is destroyed, and they begin to live to the righteousness
   of God. We ought also to attend to the comparison which he employs,
   that the thunder of the Gospel makes Satan fall like lightning; for it
   expresses the divine and astonishing power of the doctrine, which
   throws down, in a manner so sudden and violent, the prince of the world
   armed with such abundant forces. It expresses also the wretched
   condition of men, on whose heads fall the darts of Satan, who rules in
   the air, and holds the world in subjection under his feet, till Christ
   appear as a Deliverer.

   19. Lo, I give you power. This is said by way of admission. Christ does
   not affirm that the gift of which they now boast is not illustrious,
   but reminds them, that they ought to keep their eye chiefly on
   something loftier still, and not remain satisfied with outward
   miracles. He does not altogether condemn their joy, as if it were
   groundless, but shows it to be faulty in this respect, that they were
   immoderately delighted with a temporal favor, and did not elevate their
   minds higher. To this disease even the godly are almost all liable.
   Though the goodness of God is received by them with gratitude, yet the
   acts of the Divine kindness do not assist them, as they ought to do, by
   becoming ladders for ascending to heaven. This makes it necessary that
   the Lord should, as it were, stretch out his hand to raise them up,
   that they may not rest satisfied with the earth, but may aspire to
   heavenly renovation. The power of the enemy is the name given by him to
   every kind of annoyance; for all that is hostile to us is wielded
   against us by Satan. I do not mean that every thing which tends to
   injure men is placed at his disposal; but that, being armed with the
   curse of God, he endeavors to turn to our destruction all his
   chastisements, and seizes them as weapons for the purpose of wounding
   us.

   20. Your names are written. As it was the design of Christ to withdraw
   his disciples from a transitory joy, that they might glory in eternal
   life, he leads them to its origin and source, which is, that they were
   chosen by God and adopted as his children. He might indeed have
   commanded them to rejoice that they had been regenerated by the Spirit
   of God, (Titus 3:5,) and become new creatures in Christ, (2 Corinthians
   5:17;) that they had been enlightened (Ephesians 1:18) in the hope of
   salvation, and had received the earnest of the inheritance, (Ephesians
   1:14.) But he intended to point out, that the source from which all
   these benefits had flowed was the free election of God, that they might
   not claim any thing for themselves. Reasons for praising God are no
   doubt furnished by those acts of his kindness which we feel within us;
   but eternal election, which is without us, shows more clearly that our
   salvation rests on the pure goodness [54] of God. The metaphorical
   expression, your names are written in heaven, means, that they were
   acknowledged by God as His children and heirs, as if they had been
   inscribed in a register. [55]

   Matthew 11:25-30; Luke 10:21-22

   Matthew 11:25-30

   Luke 10:21-22

   25. At that time Jesus answering said, I acknowledge to thee, [56] O
   Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from
   the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to little children.
   26. Undoubtedly, O Father, such was thy good pleasure. [57] 27. All
   things have been delivered to me by my Father; and none knoweth the Son
   but the Father; and none knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom
   the Son has chosen to reveal him. [58] 28. Come to me, all that labor
   and are burdened, and I will relieve you. 29. Take my yoke upon you,
   and learn of me, that I am meek and lowly in heart, and you shall find
   rest in your souls. 30. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.


   21. In the same hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I acknowledge
   to thee, [59] O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid
   these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to
   little children: certainly, O Father, it is because such was thy good
   pleasure. 22. All things have been delivered to me by my Father, and
   none knoweth who the Son is but the Father, and who the Father is but
   the Son, and he to whom the Son shall choose to reveal him.



   Matthew 11:25. Jesus answering. Though the Hebrew verb, answer, (nh,)
   is frequently employed even in the commencement of a discourse, yet in
   this passage I consider it to be emphatic; for it was from the present
   occurrence that Christ took occasion to speak. This is more fully
   confirmed by the words of Luke, that in the same hour Jesus rejoiced in
   spirit Whence came that rejoicing? Was it not because the Church,
   composed of poor and despised persons, was viewed by him as not less
   precious and valuable than if all the nobility and high rank in the
   world had lent to it their brilliancy? Let it be observed, also, that
   the discourse is addressed to the Father, and consequently is marked by
   greater energy than if he had spoken to his disciples. It was on their
   behalf, no doubt, and for their sake, that he gave thanks to the
   Father, that they might not be displeased with the low and mean aspect
   of his Church.

   We are constantly looking for splendor; and nothing appears to us more
   incongruous, than that the heavenly kingdom of the Son of God, whose
   glory is so magnificently celebrated by the prophets, should consist of
   the dregs and offscourings of the common people. And truly it is a
   wonderful purpose of God, that though he has the whole world at his
   command, he chooses rather to select a peculiar people to himself from
   among the contemptible vulgar, than from the nobility, whose high rank
   would have been a greater ornament to the name of Christ. But here
   Christ withdraws his disciples from a proud and haughty imagination,
   that they may not venture to despise that mean and obscure condition of
   his Church, in which he delights and rejoices. To restrain more fully
   that curiosity which is constantly springing up in the minds of men, he
   rises above the world, and contemplates the secret decrees of God, that
   he may lead others to unite with him in admiring them. And certainly,
   though this appointment of God contradicts our senses, we discover not
   only blind arrogance, but excessive madness, if we murmur against it,
   while Christ our Head adores it with reverence.

   I acknowledge to thee, O Father [60] By these words he declares his
   acquiescence in that decree of the Father, which is so greatly at
   variance with human senses. There is an implied contrast between this
   praise, which he ascribes to the Father, and the malicious slanders, or
   even the impudent barkings, of the world. We must now inquire in what
   respect he glorifies the Father. It is because, while he was Lord of
   the whole world, he preferred children and ignorant persons to the wise
   It has no small weight, as connected with this subject, that he calls
   the Father Lord of heaven and earth; for in this manner he declares
   that it is a distinction which depends entirely on the will of God,
   [61] that the wise remain blind, while the ignorant and unlearned
   receive the mysteries of the Gospel. There are many other passages of a
   similar nature, in which God points out to us, that those who arrive at
   salvation have been freely chosen by him, because he is the Creator and
   Governor of the world, and all nations are his.

   This expression implies two things. First, that all do not obey the
   Gospel arises from no want of power on the part of God, who could
   easily have brought all the creatures into subjection to his
   government. Secondly, that some arrive at faith, while others remain
   hardened and obstinate, is accomplished by his free election; for,
   drawing some, and passing by others, he alone makes a distinction among
   men, whose condition by nature is alike. [62] In choosing little
   children rather than the wise, he has a regard to his glory; for the
   flesh is too apt to rise, and if able and learned men had led the way,
   it would soon have come to be the general conviction, that men obtain
   faith by their skill, or industry, or learning. In no other way can the
   mercy of God be so fully known as it ought to be, than by making such a
   choice, from which it is evident, that whatever men bring from
   themselves is nothing; and therefore human wisdom is justly thrown
   down, that it may not obscure the praise of divine grace.

   But it is asked, whom does Christ denominate wise? And whom does he
   denominate little children? For experience plainly shows, that not all
   the ignorant and unlearned on the one hand are enlightened to believe,
   and that not all the wise or learned are left in their blindness. It
   follows, that those are called wise and prudent, who, swelled with
   diabolical pride, cannot endure to hear Christ speaking to them from
   above. And yet it does not always happen that God reprobates those who
   have a higher opinion of themselves than they ought to have; as we
   learn from the instance of Paul, whose fierceness Christ subdued. If we
   come down to the ignorant multitude, the majority of whom display
   envenomed malice, we perceive that they are left to their destruction
   equally with the nobles and great men. I do acknowledge, that all
   unbelievers swell with a wicked confidence in themselves, whether their
   pride be nourished by their wisdom, or by a reputation for integrity,
   or by honors, or by riches. But I consider that Christ here includes
   all who are eminent for abilities and learning, without charging them
   with any fault; as, on the other hand, he does not represent it to be
   an excellence in any one that he is a little child. True, humble
   persons have Christ for their master, and the first lesson of faith is,
   Let no man presume on his wisdom. But Christ does not speak here as to
   voluntary childhood. He magnifies the grace of the Father on this
   ground, that he does not disdain to descend even to the lowest and most
   abominable, that he may raise up the poor out of filth.

   But here a question arises. As prudence is a gift of God, how comes it
   that it hinders us from perceiving the brightness of God, which shines
   in the Gospel? We ought, indeed, to remember what I have already said,
   that unbelievers corrupt all the prudence which they possess, and that
   men of distinguished abilities are often hindered in this respect, that
   they cannot submit to be taught. But with respect to the present
   passage I reply: Though the sagacity of the prudent does not stand in
   their way, they may notwithstanding be deprived of the light of the
   Gospel. Since the condition of all is the same or alike, why may not
   God take this or that person according to his pleasure? The reason why
   he passes by the wise and the great is declared by Paul to be, that

   God hath chosen the weak and foolish things of the world to confound
   the glory of the flesh,
   (1 Corinthians 1:27.)

   Hence also we infer, that the statement made by Christ is not
   universal, when he says, that the mysteries of the Gospel are hidden
   from the wise If out of five wise men four reject the Gospel and one
   embraces it, and if, out of an equal number of unlearned persons, two
   or three become disciples of Christ, this statement is fulfilled. This
   is also confirmed by that passage in Paul's writings, which I lately
   quoted; for he does not exclude from the kingdom of God all the wise,
   and noble, and mighty, but only declares that it does not contain many
   of them.

   The question is now solved. Prudence is not condemned as far as it is a
   gift of God, but Christ merely declares that it has no influence in
   procuring faith. On the other hand, he does not recommend ignorance, as
   if it rendered men acceptable to God, but affirms that it does not
   hinder mercy from enlightening ignorant and unlearned men with heavenly
   wisdom. It now remains to explain what is meant by revealing and
   hiding. That Christ does not speak of the outward preaching may be
   inferred with certainty from this circumstance, that he presented
   himself as a Teacher to all without distinction, and enjoined his
   Apostles to do the same. The meaning therefore is, that no man can
   obtain faith by his own acuteness, but only by the secret illumination
   of the Spirit.

   26. Undoubtedly, O Father This expression removes every pretense for
   that licentiousness of inquiry, to which we are continually excited.
   There is nothing which we yield to God with greater difficulty, than
   that his will shall be regarded by us as the highest reason and
   justice. [63] He frequently repeats, that his judgments are a deep
   abyss, (Psalm 36:6;) but we plunge with headlong violence into that
   depth, [64] and if there is any thing that does not please us, we gnash
   our teeth, or murmur against him, and many even break out into open
   blasphemies. On the contrary, our Lord lays down to us this rule, that
   whatever God has determined must be regarded by us as right. [65] This
   is sober wisdom, to acquiesce in the good pleasure of God as alone
   equal to a thousand arguments. [66] Christ might indeed have brought
   forward the causes of that distinction, if there were any; but he is
   satisfied with the good pleasure of God, and inquires no farther why he
   calls to salvation little children rather than others, and composes his
   kingdom out of an obscure flock. [67] Hence it is evident, that men
   direct their fury against Christ, when, on learning that some are
   freely chosen, and others are reprobated, by the will of God, they
   storm because they find it unpleasant to yield to God. [68]

   27. All things have been delivered to me. The connection of this
   sentence with the preceding one is not correctly understood by those
   commentators who think that Christ intends nothing more than to
   strengthen the confidence of his disciples for preaching the Gospel. My
   opinion is, that Christ spoke these words for another reason, and with
   another object in view. Having formerly asserted that the Church
   proceeds from the secret source of God's free election, he now shows in
   what manner the grace of salvation comes to men. Many persons, as soon
   as they learn that none are heirs of eternal life but those whom God
   chose before the foundation of the world, (Ephesians 1:4,) begin to
   inquire anxiously how they may be assured of God's secret purpose, and
   thus plunge into a labyrinth, from which they will find no escape.
   Christ enjoins them to come direct to himself, in order to obtain
   certainty of salvation. The meaning therefore is, that life is
   exhibited to us in Christ himself, and that no man will partake of it
   who does not enter by the gate of faith. We now see that he connects
   faith with the eternal predestination of God, -- two things which men
   foolishly and wickedly hold to be inconsistent with each other. Though
   our salvation was always hidden with God, yet Christ is the channel
   through which it flows to us, and we receive it by faith, that it may
   be secure and ratified in our hearts. We are not at liberty then to
   turn away from Christ, unless we choose to reject the salvation which
   he offers to us.

   None knoweth the Son. He says this, that we may not be guided by the
   judgment of men, and thus form an erroneous estimate of his majesty.
   The meaning therefore is, that if we wish to know what is the character
   of Christ, we must abide by the testimony of the Father, who alone can
   truly and certainly inform us what authority he hath bestowed upon him.
   And, indeed, by imagining him to be what our mind, according to its
   capacity, conceives of him, we deprive him of a great part of his
   excellence, so that we cannot know him aright but from the voice of the
   Father That voice alone would undoubtedly be insufficient without the
   guidance of the Spirit; for the power of Christ is too deep and hidden
   to be attained by men, until they have been enlightened by the Father
   We must understand him to mean, not that the Father knoweth for
   himself, but that He knoweth for us to reveal him to us.

   But the sentence appears to be incomplete, for the two clauses do not
   correspond to each other. Of the Son it is said, that none knoweth the
   Father except himself, and he to whom he shall be pleased to reveal him
   Of the Father nothing more is said than this, that He alone knoweth the
   Son. Nothing is said about revelation. I reply, that it was unnecessary
   to repeat what he had already said; for what else is contained in the
   previous thanksgiving, than that the Father hath revealed the Son to
   those who approve of him? When it is now added that He alone knoweth
   the Son, it appears to be the assigning of a reason; for this thought
   might, have occurred, What neccessity was there that the Son, who had
   openly exhibited himself to the view of men, should be revealed by the
   Father? We now perceive the reason why it was said, that none knoweth
   the Son but the Father only It now remains that we attend to the latter
   clause:

   None knoweth the Father except the Son, and he to whom the Son shall be
   pleased to reveal him. This is a different kind of knowledge from the
   former; for the Son is said to know the Father, not because he reveals
   Him by his Spirit, but because, being the lively image of Him, he
   represents Him visibly in his own person. At the same time, I do not
   exclude the Spirit, but explain the revelation here mentioned as
   referring to the manner of communicating information. This agrees most
   completely with the context; for Christ confirms what he had formerly
   said, that all things had been delivered to him by his Father, by
   informing us that the fullness of the Godhead dwelleth in him,
   (Colossians 2:9.) The passage may be thus summed up: [69] First, it is
   the gift of the Father, that the Son is known, because by his Spirit he
   opens the eyes of our mind to discern the glory of Christ, which
   otherwise would have been hidden from us. Secondly, the Father, who
   dwells in inaccessible light, and is in himself incomprehensible, is
   revealed to us by the Son, because he is the lively image of Him, so
   that it is in vain to seek for Him elsewhere. [70]

   28. Come to me all that labor He now kindly invites to himself those
   whom he acknowledges to be fit for becoming his disciples. Though he is
   ready to reveal the Father to all, yet the greater part are careless
   about coming to him, because they are not affected by a conviction of
   their necessities. Hypocrites give themselves no concern about Christ,
   because they are intoxicated with their own righteousness, and neither
   hunger nor thirst (Matthew 5:6) for his grace. Those who are devoted to
   the world set no value on heavenly life. It would be in vain,
   therefore, for Christ to invite either of these classes, and therefore
   he turns to the wretched and afflicted. He speaks of them as laboring,
   or groaning under a burden, and does not mean generally those who are
   oppressed with grief and vexations, but those who are overwhelmed by
   their sins, who are filled with alarm at the wrath of God, and are
   ready to sink under so weighty a burden. There are various methods,
   indeed, by which God humbles his elect; but as the greater part of
   those who are loaded with afflictions still remain obstinate and
   rebellious, Christ means by persons laboring and burdened, those whose
   consciences are distressed by their exposure to eternal death, and who
   are inwardly so pressed down by their miseries that they faint; for
   this very fainting prepares them for receiving his grace. He tells us
   that the reason why most men despise his grace is, that they are not
   sensible of their poverty; but that there is no reason why their pride
   or folly should keep back afflicted souls that long for relief.

   Let us therefore bid adieu to all who, entangled by the snares of
   Satan, either are persuaded that they possess a righteousness out of
   Christ, or imagine that they are happy in this world. Let our miseries
   drive us to seek Christ; and as he admits none to the enjoyment of his
   rest but those who sink under the burden, let us learn, that there is
   no venom more deadly than that slothfulness which is produced in us,
   either by earthly happiness, or by a false and deceitful opinion of our
   own righteousness and virtue. Let each of us labor earnestly to arouse
   himself, first, by vigorously shaking off the luxuries of the world;
   and, secondly, by laying aside every false confidence. Now though this
   preparation for coming to Christ makes them as dead men, [71] yet it
   ought to be observed, that it is the gift of the Holy Spirit, because
   it is the commencement of repentance, to which no man aspires in his
   own strength. Christ did not intend to show what man can do of himself,
   but only to inform us what must be the feelings of those who come to
   him.

   They who limit the burden and the labor to ceremonies of the Law, take
   a very narrow view of Christ's meaning. I do acknowledge, that the Law
   was intolerably burdensome, and overwhelmed the souls of worshippers;
   but we must bear in mind what I have said, that Christ stretches out
   his hand to all the afflicted, and thus lays down a distinction between
   his disciples and those who despise the Gospel. But we must attend to
   the universality of the expression; for Christ included all, without
   exception, who labor and are burdened, that no man may shut the gate
   against himself by wicked doubts. [72] And yet all such persons are few
   in number; for, among the innumerable multitude of those that perish,
   few are aware that they are perishing. The relief which he promises
   consists in the free pardon of sins, which alone gives us peace.

   29. Take my yoke upon you. Many persons, we perceive, abuse the grace
   of Christ by turning it into an indulgence of the flesh; and therefore
   Christ, after promising joyful rest to wretchedly distressed
   consciences, reminds them, at the same time, that he is their Deliverer
   on condition of their submitting to his yoke. He does not, he tells us,
   absolve men from their sins in such a manner, that, restored to the
   favor of God, they may sin with greater freedom, but that, raised up by
   his grace, they may also take his yoke upon them, and that, being free
   in spirit, they may restrain the licentiousness of their flesh. And
   hence we obtain a definition of that rest of which he had spoken. It is
   not at all intended to exempt the disciples of Christ from the warfare
   of the flesh, that they may enjoy themselves at their ease, but to
   train them under the burden of discipline, and keep them under the
   yoke.

   Learn of me It is a mistake, I think, to suppose that Christ here
   assures us of his meekness, lest his disciples, under the influence of
   that fear which is usually experienced in approaching persons of
   distinction, should remain at a distance from him on account of his
   Divine glory. It is rather his design to form us to the imitation of
   himself, because the obstinacy of the flesh leads us to shrink from his
   yoke as harsh and uneasy. Shortly afterwards, he adds, (verse 30,) my
   yoke is easy But how shall any man be brought willingly and gently to
   bend his neck, unless, by putting on meekness, he be conformed to
   Christ? That this is the meaning of the words is plain; for Christ,
   after exhorting his disciples to bear his yoke, and desirous to prevent
   them from being deterred by its difficulty, immediately adds, Learn of
   me; thus declaring that, when his example shall have accustomed us to
   meekness and humility, we shall no longer feel his yoke to be
   troublesome. To the same purpose he adds, I will relieve you So long as
   the flesh kicks, we rebel; and those who refuse the yoke of Christ, and
   endeavor to appease God in any other manner, distress and waste
   themselves in vain. In this manner, we see the Papists wretchedly
   torturing themselves, and silently enduring the dreadful tyranny under
   which they groan, that they may not bow to the yoke of Christ.

   Matthew 12:1-8

   Mark 2:23-28

   Luke 6:1-5

   1. At that time Jesus was passing through the corn-fields on the
   Sabbath; [73] and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the
   ears of corn, and to eat. 2. But when the Pharisees saw it, they said
   to him, Lo, thy disciples do what it is not lawful to do on the
   Sabbath. 3. But he said to them, Have you not read what David did, when
   he was hungry, and those who were with him? 4. How he entered into the
   house of God, and ate the shew-bread, which it was not lawful for him
   to eat, nor for those who were with him, but for the priests alone?
   5. Or have you not read in the Law, that on the Sabbath the priests in
   the temple profane the temple, and are free from blame? [74] 6. But I
   say to you, That one greater than the temple is in this place. 7. But
   if you knew what that is, I choose mercy, and not sacrifice, you would
   not have condemned the innocent. 8. For the Son of man is Lord even of
   the Sabbath.


   23. And it happened, that he was passing through the corn-fields, and
   his disciples began to pluck the ears of corn as they went along.
   24. And the Pharisees said to him, Lo, why do they on the Sabbath what
   is not lawful? 25. And he said to them, Have you not read what David
   did, when he had need, and was hungry, and those who were with him?
   26. How he entered into the house of God in the time of Abiathar, the
   high-priest, and ate the shew-bread, which it is not lawful to eat but
   for the priests, and gave also [75] to those who were with him? 27. And
   he said to them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the
   Sabbath. 28. Therefore the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath.


   1. And it happened that, on the second-first Sabbath, he was passing
   through the cornfields; and his disciples were plucking ears of corn,
   and were eating, rubbing them in their hands. 2. And some of the
   Pharisees said to them, Why do you do what it is not lawful to do on
   the Sabbath? 3. And Jesus answering saith to them, Have you not read
   even this which David did when he was hungry, and those who were with
   him? 4. How he entered into the house of God, and took the shew-bread,
   and ate it, and gave also to those who were with him, which it is not
   lawful to eat but only for the priests? 5. And he said to them, The Son
   of man is Lord even of the Sabbath.



   Matthew 12:1. Jesus was walking on the Sabbath It was the design of the
   Evangelists, in this history, to show partly what a malicious
   disposition the Pharisees had, and partly how superstitiously they were
   attached to outward and slight matters, so as to make holiness to
   consist in them entirely. They blame the disciples of Christ for
   plucking the ears of corn on the Sabbath, during their journey, when
   they were pressed with hunger, as if, by so doing, they were violating
   the Sabbath. The keeping of the Sabbath was, indeed, a holy thing, but
   not such a manner of keeping it as they imagined, so that one could
   scarcely move a finger without making the conscience to tremble. [76]
   It was hypocrisy, therefore, that made them so exact in trifling
   matters, while they spared themselves in gross superstitions; as Christ
   elsewhere upbraids them with

   paying tithe of mint and anise, and neglecting the
   important matters of the Law, (Matthew 23:23.)

   It is the invariable practice of hypocrites to allow themselves liberty
   in matters of the greatest consequence, and to pay close attention to
   ceremonial observances. Another reason why they demand that outward
   rites should be more rigorously observed is, that they wish to make
   their duty toward God to consist only in carnal worship. But it was
   malevolence and envy, still more than superstition, that led them to
   this act of censure; for towards others they would not have been
   equally stern. It is proper for us to observe the feelings by which
   they were animated, lest any one should be distressed by the fact, that
   the very Doctors of the Law were so hostile to Christ.

   Luke 6:1. On the second-first Sabbath It is beyond all question that
   this Sabbath belonged to some one of the festival-days which the Law
   enjoined to be observed once every year. Some have thought that there
   were two festival-days in immediate succession; but as the Jews had
   arranged their festival-days after the Babylonish captivity so that one
   day always intervened between them, that opinion is set aside. Others
   maintain with greater probability, that it was the last day of the
   solemnity, which was as numerously attended as the first. I am more
   inclined to favor those who understand by it the second festivity in
   the year; and this agrees exceedingly well with the name given to it,
   the second-first Sabbath, because, among the great Sabbaths which were
   annually observed, it was the second in the order of time. Now the
   first was the Passover, and it is therefore probable that this was the
   feast of first-fruits, (Exodus 23:15, 16.)

   Mark 2:24. Why do they on the Sabbath what is not lawful? The Pharisees
   do not blame the disciples of Christ for plucking ears of corn from a
   field that was not their own, but for violating the Sabbath; as if
   there had been a precept to this effect, that famishing men ought
   rather to die than to satisfy their hunger. Now the only reason for
   keeping the Sabbath was, that the people, by sanctifying themselves to
   God, might be employed in true and spiritual worship; and next, that,
   being free from all worldly occupations, they might be more at liberty
   to attend the holy assemblies. The lawful observation of it, therefore,
   must have a reference to this object; for the Law ought to be
   interpreted according to the design of the Legislator. But this shows
   clearly the malicious and implacable nature of superstition, and
   particularly the proud and cruel dispositions of hypocrites, when
   ambition is joined to hatred of the person. It was not the mere
   affectation of pretended holiness, as I have said, that made the
   Pharisees so stern and rigorous; but as they expressly wished to carp
   at every thing that Christ said or did, they could not do otherwise
   than put a wrong meaning in cases where there was nothing to blame, as
   usually happens with prejudiced interpreters. The accusation was
   brought--according to Matthew and Mark--against our Lord,
   and--according to Luke--against his disciples. But there is no
   inconsistency here; for the disciples were in all probability so
   harassed, that the charge was directed chiefly against the Master
   himself. It is even possible that the Pharisees first wrangled with the
   disciples, and afterwards with Christ, and that, in the rage of their
   malice, they blamed him for remaining silent, and permitting his
   disciples to break the Sabbath.

   Matthew 12:3. Have you not read what David did? Christ employs five
   arguments to refute their calumny. First, he apologizes for his
   disciples by pleading the example of David, (1 Samuel 21:6.) While
   David was fleeing from the rage of Saul, he applied for provisions to
   the high-priest Ahimelech; and there being no ordinary food at hand, he
   succeeded in obtaining a part of the holy bread. If David's necessity
   excused him, the same argument ought to be admitted in the case of
   others. Hence it follows, that the ceremonies of the Law are not
   violated where there is no infringement of godliness. [77] Now Christ
   takes for granted, that David was free from blame, because the Holy
   Spirit bestows commendation on the priest who allowed him to partake of
   the holy bread. When he says, that it was not lawful to eat that bread
   but for the priests alone, we must understand him to refer to the
   ordinary law:

   they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made,
   to consecrate and to sanctify them; but a stranger shall not
   eat thereof, because they are holy, (Exodus 29:33.)

   If David had attempted to do what was contrary to law, it would have
   been in vain for Christ to plead his example; for what had been
   prohibited for a particular end no necessity could make lawful.

   5. That on the Sabbaths the priests profane the Sabbath. This is the
   second argument by which Christ proves that the violation of the
   Sabbath, of which the Pharisees complained, was free from all blame;
   because on the Sabbaths it is lawful to slay beasts for sacrifice, to
   circumcise infants, and to do other things relating to the worship of
   God. Hence it follows, that the duties of piety are in no degree
   inconsistent with each other. [78] But if the temple sanctifies manual
   operations connected with sacrifices, and with the whole of the outward
   service, the holiness of the true and spiritual temple has greater
   efficacy, in exempting its worshippers from all blame, while they are
   discharging the duties of godliness. [79] Now the object which the
   disciples had in view was, to present to God souls which were
   consecrated by the Gospel.

   Matthew alone glances at this argument. When Christ says, that the
   priests Profane the Sabbath, the expression is not strictly accurate,
   and is accommodated to his hearers; for when the Law enjoins men to
   abstain from their employments, it does not forbid them to perform the
   services of religion. But Christ admits that to be true which might
   appear to be so in the eye of ignorant persons, [80] and rests
   satisfied with proving, that the labors performed in the temple are not
   offensive to God.

   7. But if you knew This Third argument is also mentioned by Matthew
   alone. Christ conveys an indirect reproof to the Pharisees, for not
   considering why ceremonies were appointed, and to what object they are
   directed. This has been a common fault in almost every age; and
   therefore the prophet Hosea (6:6) exclaims against the men of his own
   age for being too much attached to ceremonies, and caring little about
   the duties of kindness. But God declares aloud, that he sets a higher
   value on mercy than on sacrifice, employing the word mercy, by a figure
   of speech, for offices of kindness, as sacrifices include the outward
   service of the Law. This statement Christ applies to his own time, and
   charges the Pharisees with wickedly torturing the Law of God out of its
   true meaning, with disregarding the second table, and being entirely
   occupied with ceremonies.

   But a question arises: Why does God declare that he is indifferent
   about ceremonies, when he strictly enjoined in his Law that they should
   be observed? The answer is easy. External rites are of no value in
   themselves, and are demanded by God in so far only as they are directed
   to their proper object. Besides, God does not absolutely reject them,
   but, by a comparison with deeds of kindness, pronounces that they are
   inferior to the latter in actual value. Nor is it inconsistent with
   this to say, that in the perfection of righteousness the highest rank
   belongs to the worship of God, and the duties which men owe to each
   other occupy the second rank. For, though piety is justly reckoned to
   be as much superior to charity as God is higher than men, yet as
   believers, by practicing justice towards each other, prove that their
   service of God is sincere, it is not without reason that this subject
   is brought under the notice of hypocrites, who imitate piety by outward
   signs, and yet pervert it by confining their laborious efforts to the
   carnal worship alone. [81] From the testimony of the Prophet, Christ
   justly infers that no blame attaches to his disciples; for while God
   trained his people in the rudiments of the Law, it was far from being
   his design to kill wretched men with famine.

   8. For the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath. Some connect this
   sentence with a preceding statement, that one greater than the temple
   is in this place, (ver. 6;) but I look upon them as different. In the
   former case, Christ, by an allusion to the temple, affirmed that
   whatever was connected with his personal holiness was not a
   transgression of the Law; but now, he declares that he has received
   authority to exempt his followers from the necessity of observing the
   Sabbath. The Son of man, (he says,) in the exercise of his authority,
   can relax the Sabbath in the same manner as other legal ceremonies. And
   certainly out of Christ the bondage of the Law is wretched, from which
   he alone delivers those on whom he bestows the free Spirit of adoption,
   [82] (Romans 8:15.)

   Mark 2:27. The Sabbath was made for man. This Fifth argument is related
   by Mark alone. The general meaning is, that those persons judge amiss
   who turn to man's destruction, [83] the Sabbath which God appointed for
   his benefit. The Pharisees saw the disciples of Christ employed in a
   holy work; they saw them worn out with the fatigue of the journey, and
   partly with want of food; and yet are offended that, when they are
   hungry, they take a few grains of corn for the support of their wearied
   bodies. Is not this a foolish attempt to overturn the purpose of God,
   when they demand to the injury of men that observation of the Sabbath
   which he intended to be advantageous? But they are mistaken, I think,
   who suppose that in this passage the Sabbath is entirely abolished; for
   Christ simply informs us what is the proper use of it. Though he
   asserted, a little before, that he is Lord of the Sabbath, yet the full
   time for its abolition [84] was not yet come, because the veil of the
   temple was not yet rent, (Matthew 27:51.)

   Matthew 12:9-13

   Mark 3:1-5

   Luke 6:6-10

   9. And having departed thence, he came into their synagogue: 10. And,
   lo, there was a man having a withered hand, and they asked him, saying,
   Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbaths? that they might accuse him.
   11. But he said to them, What man shall there be among you who shall
   have one sheep, and if it fall on the Sabbath into a ditch, will not
   lay hold on it, and lift it out? 12. How much more then is a man better
   than a sheep? Therefore it is lawful to do well on the Sabbaths.
   13. Then he saith to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched it
   out, and it was restored to soundness like the other.


   1. And he entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there
   having a withered hand. 2. And they watched him, if he would heal that
   man on the Sabbath, that they might accuse him. 3. And he said to the
   man having the withered hand, Rise up in the midst. 4. Whether is it
   lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil? to save life or to
   kill? But they were silent. 5. And when he had looked round upon them
   with indignation, grieving on account of the blindness of their heart,
   he saith to the man, Stretch out thy hand; and he stretched it out, and
   his hand was restored to soundness like the other.


   6. And it happened also on another Sabbath, that he entered into the
   synagogue, and taught; and there was a man there whose right hand was
   withered. 7. And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, if he would
   heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an opportunity of accusing
   him. 8. But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man that had the
   withered hand, Rise up, and stand in the midst. And he rose up and
   stood. 9. Jesus therefore saith to them, I will ask you, Whether is it
   lawful on the Sabbaths to do good or to do evil? to save life or to
   destroy it? 10. And when he had looked round about upon them all, he
   said to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was
   restored sound like the other.


   Matthew 12:9. And having departed thence. This narrative and that which
   immediately precedes it have the same object; which is to show, that
   the scribes watched with a malicious eye for the purpose of turning
   into slander every thing that Christ did, and consequently that we need
   not wonder if men, whose minds were so depraved, were his implacable
   enemies. We see also, that it is usual with hypocrites to pursue what
   is nothing more than a shadow of the righteousness of the Law, and as
   the common saying is, to stickle more about the form than about the
   substance. First, then, let us learn from this passage to keep our
   minds pure, and free from every wicked disposition, when we are about
   to form a decision on any question; for if hatred, or pride, or
   anything of that description, reign within us, we will not only do
   injury to men, but will insult God himself, and turn light into
   darkness. No man, who was free from malice, would have refused to
   acknowledge that it was a Divine work, which those good teachers do not
   scruple to condemn. [85] Whence comes such fury, but because all their
   senses are affected by a wicked hatred of Christ, so that they are
   blind amidst the full brightness of the sun? We learn also, that we
   ought to beware lest, by attaching undue importance to ceremonial
   observances, we allow other things to be neglected, which are of far
   higher value in the sight of God, and which Christ in another passage
   calls the more important matters of the Law, (Matthew 23:23.) For so
   strongly are we inclined to outward rites, that we shall never preserve
   moderation in this respect, unless we constantly remember, that
   whatever is enjoined respecting the worship of God is, in the first
   place, spiritual; and, secondly, ought to be regulated by the rule
   which Christ has laid down to us in this passage.

   10. They asked him, saying. Mark and Luke say only that they watched
   what our Lord would do; but Matthew states more clearly that they also
   attacked him by words. It is probable, that some others had been
   previously cured on Sabbath-days; and hence they take occasion to ask
   if he believes it to be lawful for him to do again what he had formerly
   done. They ought to have considered whether it was a work of God, or of
   man, to restore a withered hand by a mere touch, or by a single word.
   When God appointed the Sabbath, he did not lay down a law for himself,
   or impose upon himself any restraint from performing operations on the
   Sabbath, when he saw it to be proper, in the same manner as on other
   days. It was excessive folly, therefore, to call this in question, and
   thus to prescribe rules for God himself, and to restrain the freedom of
   his operations.

   11. What man shall there be among you who shall have a sheep? Christ
   again points out what is the true way of keeping the Sabbath; and, at
   the same time, reproves them for slander, in bringing as a charge
   against him what was a universal custom. For if any man's sheep had
   fallen into a ditch, no person would have hindered it from being taken
   out: but in proportion as a man is of more value than a sheep, so much
   the more are we at liberty to assist him. It is plain, therefore, that
   if any man should relieve the necessity of brethren, he did not, in any
   degree, violate the rest which the Lord has enjoined. Mark and Luke
   take no notice of this comparison, but only state that Christ inquired,
   Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil?

   He who takes away the life of a man is held to be a criminal; and there
   is little difference between manslaughter and the conduct of him who
   does not concern himself about relieving a person in distress. So then
   Christ indirectly charges them with endeavoring, under the pretense of
   a holy act, to compel him to do evil; for sin is committed, as we have
   already said, not only by him who does any thing contrary to the Law,
   but also by him who neglects his duty. Hence also we perceive, that
   Christ did not always employ the same arguments in refuting this
   slander; for he does not reason here about his divinity as he does in
   the case mentioned by John, (v. 18.) Nor was there any necessity for
   doing so; since the Pharisees were completely refuted by this single
   defense, that nothing could be more unreasonable than to pronounce a
   man, who imitated God, to be a transgressor of the Sabbath.

   Luke 6:8. But he knew their thoughts If Matthew states the truth, they
   had openly declared by their language what was in their minds; and
   therefore Christ replies not to their secret thoughts, but to express
   words. But both may be true, that they spoke plainly, and yet that
   Christ discerned their secret thoughts; for they did not openly avow
   their designs, and Matthew himself tells us that their question was
   intended to take Christ by surprise; and, consequently, Luke means
   nothing more than that Christ was aware of their insidious designs,
   though not expressed in words.

   Mark 3:5. And when he had looked around upon them with indignation To
   convince us that this was a just and holy anger, Mark explains the
   reason of it to be, that he was grieved on account of the blindness of
   their hearts. First, then, Christ is grieved, because men who have been
   instructed in the Law of God are so grossly blind; but as it was malice
   that blinded them, his grief is accompanied by indignation. This is the
   true moderation of zeal, to be distressed about the destruction of
   wicked men, and, at the same time, to be filled with wrath at their
   ungodliness. Again, as this passage assures us, that Christ was not
   free from human passions, we infer from it, that the passions
   themselves are not sinful, provided there be no excess. In consequence
   of the corruption of our nature, we do not preserve moderation; and our
   anger, even when it rests on proper grounds, is never free from sin.
   With Christ the case was different; for not only did his nature retain
   its original purity, but he was a perfect pattern of righteousness. We
   ought therefore to implore from heaven the Spirit of God to correct our
   excesses.

   Matthew 12:14-21

   Mark 3:6-12

   Luke 6:11

   14. Then the Pharisees went out, and took counsel against him, how they
   might destroy him. [86] 15. But when Jesus knew this, he withdrew from
   that place; and great multitudes followed him, and he cured them all.
   16. And he threatened them, [87] that they should not make him known:
   17. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the Prophet,
   who says, 18. Lo, my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom
   my soul is well pleased: I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall
   proclaim judgment to the Gentiles. 19. He shall not strive, nor cry,
   nor shall any man hear his voice in the streets. 20. The bruised reed
   he will not break, and the smoking flax he will not quench, till he
   send forth judgment into victory. 21. And in his name the Gentiles will
   trust.


   6. And the Pharisees went out, and immediately took counsel with the
   Herodians against him, to destroy him. 7. And Jesus withdrew with his
   disciples to the sea, and a vast multitude followed him from Galilee,
   and from Judea. 8. And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond
   Jordan; and a great multitude (of men) who dwelt around Tyre and Sidon,
   who, when they had heard what he was doing, came to him. 9. And he
   commanded his disciples, that a small ship should wait upon him on
   account of the multitude, that they might not press upon him. 10. For
   he had cured many; so that as many as were afflicted pressed upon him
   to touch him. 11. And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down
   before him, and cried out, saying, Thou art the Son of God. 12. And he
   vehemently threatened the that they should not make him known

   11. And they were filled with madness, and talked with each other what
   they should do to Jesus.



   Matthew 12:14. Then the Pharisees took counsel. How obstinate is the
   rage which drives the wicked to oppose God! Even after having been
   convinced, they pour out their venom more and more. It is truly
   monstrous and shocking, that the most distinguished teachers of the
   Law, who were entrusted with the government of the Church, are engaged,
   like robbers, in contriving murder. But this must happen, whenever the
   malice of men reaches such a height, that they wish to destroy every
   thing that is opposed to their fancy, even though it may be from God.

   The circumstance of Christ's making his escape by flight must not be
   ascribed to fear; for he did not become more courageous by the lapse of
   time, but was endued with the same fortitude of the Spirit at the time
   when he fled, as when, at a later period, he voluntarily presented
   himself to die. And this was a part of that emptying of himself which
   Paul mentions, (Philippians 2:7,) that when he could easily have
   protected his life by a miracle, he chose rather to submit to our
   weakness by taking flight. The only reason why he delayed to die was,
   that the seasonable time, which had been appointed by the Father, was
   not yet come, (John 7:30; 8:20.) And yet it is manifest, that he was
   preserved by heavenly power rather than by flight; for it would not
   have been difficult for his enemies to find out the place to which he
   had retired, and so far was he from shrouding himself in darkness, that
   he carried a great company along with him, and rendered that place
   illustrious by his miracles. He withdrew from their presence for the
   sole purpose of not aggravating their rage.

   Mark 3:6. The Pharisees took counsel with the Herodians. Now they
   regarded the Herodians with the fiercest hatred; for their eagerness to
   be considered the guardians and protectors of public liberty made it
   necessary for them to make an open profession of mortal hatred to the
   ministers of that tyrant. And yet this aversion is counteracted by
   their hatred and fury against Christ, [88] which makes them not only
   enter into a conspiracy with foreigners, but insinuate themselves into
   the good graces of those with whom, on other occasions, they would have
   shrunk from intercourse. While ungodliness hurries men in various
   directions, and drives them to different courses, it engages them, with
   one consent, in a contest with God. No hostilities prevent them from
   giving their hand to each other for opposing the truth of God.

   Matthew 12:16. And he threatened them. The expression used by Mark
   conveys, in a still more pointed manner, that he restrained the unclean
   spirits, [89] who were exclaiming, Thou art the Son of God. We have
   formerly explained the reason why he did not choose to have such
   witnesses. [90] And yet there is no room to doubt, that divine power
   extorted from the devils this confession; but having made it evident
   that they were subject to his dominion, Christ properly rejected their
   testimony. But Matthew goes farther, and states, that Christ discharged
   them from spreading the fame of the miracles which he was performing.
   Not that he wished that fame to be wholly repressed, (as we have
   pointed out on other occasions, [91] but to allow it to strike root,
   that it might bring forth abundant fruit at the proper season. We know
   that Christ did not perform miracles for the purpose of amusement, but
   had a distinct object in view, which was to prove that he was the Son
   of God, and the appointed Redeemer of the world. But he was manifested
   gradually, and by regular steps, and was not revealed in his true
   character

   "until the time appointed by the Father,"
   (Galatians 4:2.)

   At the same time, it deserves our attention, that when wicked men do
   their utmost to extinguish the glory of God, they are so far from
   gaining their wish, that, on the contrary, God turns their rebellious
   designs in an opposite direction. Though Christ withdrew from a
   populous district, yet in this very concealment [92] his glory
   continues to shine, and even bursts forth magnificently into its full
   splendor.

   17. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken Matthew does not mean
   that this prediction was entirely fulfilled by Christ's prohibiting
   loud and general reports to be circulated respecting his power [93] ,
   but that this was an exhibition of that mildness which Isaiah describes
   in the person of the Messiah. Those wonderful works which Christ
   performed in presence of a few, and which he did not wish to be
   announced in pompous terms, were fitted to shake heaven and earth,
   (Hebrews 12:26.) It was, therefore, no ordinary proof, how widely he
   was removed from the pomp and ostentation of the world.

   But it will be proper for us to examine more closely the design of
   Matthew. By this circumstance he intended to show, that the glory of
   Christ's divinity ought not to be the less admired, because it appeared
   under a veil of infirmity. This is unquestionably the very object to
   which the Holy Spirit directed the eyes of the prophet. The flesh is
   constantly longing for outward display, and to guard believers against
   seeking any thing of this description in the Messiah, the Spirit of God
   declared that he would be totally different from earthly kings, who, in
   order to draw admiration upon themselves, produce great noises wherever
   they go, and fill cities and towns with commotion. [94] We now perceive
   how appropriately Matthew applies the prediction of the prophet to the
   case in hand. God appointed for his Son a low and mean appearance, and
   that ignorant persons may not take offense at an aspect which has no
   attraction, and is fitted to awaken contempt, both the prophet and
   Matthew come forward to declare, that it is not by accident, but in
   consequence of a decree of Heaven, that he assumes such a character.
   [95] Hence it follows, that deep blame attaches to all who despise
   Christ, because his outward condition does not correspond to the wishes
   of the flesh. We are not at liberty to imagine to ourselves a Christ
   that corresponds to our fancy, but ought simply to embrace him as he is
   offered by the Father. He who is offended by the low condition of
   Christ, which God declares to be agreeable to his will, is unworthy of
   salvation. I now come to examine the words of the prophet, (Isaiah
   42:1.)

   18. Lo, my servant, whom I have chosen. To fix our attention more
   closely on his will, God points out by the finger, as it were, the
   person whom he is about to send; and this is the design of the
   exclamation, Lo! A similar reason may be assigned for the epithets that
   follow, when God calls him his servant, his elect in whom his soul is
   well pleased. For whence comes it, that men venture to measure Christ
   by their own sense, but because they do not consider that their
   redemption depends exclusively on the grace of God? When God offers to
   us an invaluable treasure, it is excessive and wicked presumption to
   regulate our estimation of it by the disdainful views of our flesh. He
   is called a servant, not as if he were of the ordinary rank, but by way
   of eminence, and as the person to whom God has committed the charge and
   office of redeeming his Church. As:

   no man taketh this honor to himself, but he who is called of God
   (Hebrews 5:6)

   is justly entitled to this rank, God declares that he who comes forward
   in this character was elected by his decree. [96] Hence it follows,
   that men are not at liberty to reject him; because, by doing so, they
   would be guilty of contempt and rebellion against God. And, indeed, it
   were the height of absurdity that our choice or our pride should set
   aside that calling of God which ought to be regarded as sacred and
   inviolable.

   My beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased. There is a still wider
   import in this statement, which God next makes by the prophet, that the
   delight of his soul dwells in Christ; for though the calling of each of
   us proceeds from the free favor of God as its only source, yet in
   Christ there is this remarkable peculiarity, that in his person God the
   Father embraces in his love the whole Church. As we are all by nature
   enemies of God, his love will never come to us till it first begin with
   the Head; which we have seen on a former occasion, and will see again
   under another passage, (Matthew 17:5.)

   He will proclaim judgment to the Gentiles. The prophet gives a brief
   description of Christ's office, when he foretells that he will proclaim
   judgment to the Gentiles By the word judgment the Jews understand a
   government which is correctly and properly arranged, in which order and
   justice prevail. The design of the prophet is to inform us, that a
   person will come who will restore justice that had fallen, who will be
   the governor not of one nation only, but will also bring under
   subjection to God the Gentiles, among whom dreadful confusion formerly
   prevailed. And this is the import of the word bring forth, which the
   prophet employs; for it was the office of Christ to spread throughout
   the whole world the kingdom of God, which was at that time confined to
   the corner of Judea; [97] as it is said in another passage,

   The Lord will send forth the scepter of thy power out of Zion,
   (Psalm 110:2.)

   I will put my Spirit upon him. This explains the manner in which
   judgment shall be brought forth. It is no doubt true, that there never
   was any portion whatever of righteousness in the world that did not
   proceed from the Spirit of God, and that was not maintained by his
   heavenly power; as none of the kings of the earth can frame or defend
   good order, except so far as he shall be assisted by the same Spirit.
   But in bringing forth judgment Christ is greatly superior to all
   others, for he has received the Spirit from the Father, that he may
   pour it out on all his people; for not only does he by word or writing
   prescribe what is proper, but inwardly forms the hearts of men, by the
   grace of his Spirit, to preserve the rule of righteousness.

   19. He will not strive The general meaning is, that the coming of
   Christ will not be attended by noise, will have nothing of royal
   splendor and magnificence. He presently adds, that this will turn to
   the advantage of men, by inducing them to love that mildness which the
   world everywhere despises. And certainly it is an astonishing display
   of the folly of men, that their sentiments with regard to Christ are
   less respectful, because he mildly and voluntarily accommodates himself
   to their capacity. Were Christ to appear in his glory, what else could
   be expected, but that it would altogether swallow us up? What
   wickedness then is it to be less willing to receive him, when on our
   account he descends from his elevation?

   That the gentleness of Christ may awaken reverence in believers, Isaiah
   reminds them how advantageous, and even how necessary that gentleness
   must be. Each of us is conscious of his own weakness; and therefore we
   ought to consider of what importance it is that Christ should treat us
   with kindness. I speak not of unbelievers, who are entirely destitute
   of all the graces of the Spirit; but with respect to those whom God has
   already called, are they not like a half-broken reed and a smoking
   lamp, till God kindle them to full brightness, and supply them with
   perfect strength? When Christ is thus pleased to condescend to our
   weakness, let his unspeakable goodness be embraced by us with joy.
   Meanwhile, let none flatter himself in his vices, but let each of us
   labor to make greater proficiency, that we may not be tossed about
   (Ephesians 4:14) through our whole life, or bend, like reeds, to the
   slightest gale. Let us grow to the stature of perfect men, that we may
   remain firm against the diversified attacks of Satan, that our faith
   may not only emit slight sparks encompassed by thick smoke, but may
   send out bright rays.

   The example of Christ instructs all his ministers in what manner they
   ought to conduct themselves. But as there are some who falsely and
   absurdly maintain that mildness ought to be exercised indiscriminately
   towards all, we must attend to the distinction which the prophet
   expressly makes between weak and wicked persons. Those who are too
   stubborn need to have their hardness beaten violently with a hammer;
   and those who endeavor to spread darkness in every direction, or who
   act as torches to kindle conflagrations, must have their smoke
   dispelled and their flame extinguished. While the faithful ministers of
   the Word ought to endeavor to spare the weak, and thus to cherish and
   increase that portion of the grace of God, however small, which they
   possess, they must also exercise prudent caution, lest they encourage
   the obstinate malice of those who have no resemblance to the smoking
   lamp or bruised reed.

   20. Till he send out judgment into victory. The words of the prophet
   are a little different, he will bring forth the judgment unto truth.
   But the term employed by Matthew is very emphatic, and is intended to
   inform us, that justice is not established in the world without a great
   struggle and exertion. The devil throws all possible difficulties in
   the way, which cannot be removed without violent opposition. This is
   confirmed by the word victory, for victory is not obtained in any other
   way than by fighting.

   21. And in his name shall the Gentiles trust Instead of these words the
   prophet has, The isles shall wait for his law. But though Matthew has
   changed the words, the meaning is the same, that the grace of Christ
   will be shared by the Gentiles.

   Matthew 12:22-24

   Mark 3:20-22

   Luke 11:14-15

   22. Then was brought to him one who was tormented by a devil, blind and
   dumb; and he cured him, so that the blind and dumb person both spoke
   and saw. 23. And all the multitudes were astonished, and said, Is not
   this the son of David? 24. But when the Pharisees heard it, they said,
   This man doth not cast out devils but by Beelzebub prince of the
   devils.


   20. And they come into the house, and immediately a multitude
   assembled, so that they could not even eat bread. [98] 21. And when
   those who were related to him heard it, they went out to lay hands on
   him; [99] for they said, He is gone mad. [100] 22. And the Scribes, who
   had come down from Jerusalem, said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the
   prince of the devils he casteth out devils.

   14. And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. [101] And when he
   had cast out the devil, the dumb person spoke, and the multitudes
   wondered. [102] 15. And some of them said, By Beelzebub, the prince of
   the devils, he casteth out devils. [103]



   Mark 3:20. And they come into the house. Mark undoubtedly takes in a
   somewhat extended period of time, when he passes from the miracles to
   that wicked conspiracy which the relatives of Christ formed with each
   other, to bind him as if he had been a madman. Matthew and Luke mention
   not more than a single miracle, as having given to the Pharisees an
   opportunity of slander; but as all the three agree in this last clause
   which is contained in Mark's narrative, I have thought it proper to
   insert it here.

   It is wonderful that such wickedness should have been found among the
   relatives of Christ, who ought to have been the first to aid him in
   advancing the kingdom of God. When they see that he has already
   obtained some reputation, their ambition leads them to desire that he
   should be admired in Jerusalem; for they exhort him to go up to that
   city,

   that he may show himself more openly, (John 7:3,4.)

   But now that they perceive him to be hated on one side by the rulers,
   exposed on another to numerous slanders, and even despised by the great
   body of the people--to prevent any injury, or envy, or dishonor, from
   arising to the whole family, they form the design of laying hands on
   him, and binding him at home, as if he had been a person who labored
   under mental derangement; and, as appears from the words of the
   Evangelist, such was their actual belief.

   Hence we learn, first, how great is the blindness of the human mind, in
   forming such perverse judgments about the glory of God when openly
   displayed. Certainly, in all that Christ said and did, the power of the
   Holy Spirit shone magnificently; and if others had not clearly
   perceived it, how could it be unknown to his relatives, who were
   intimately acquainted with him? But because Christ's manner of acting
   does not please the world, and is so far from gaining its good graces
   that it exposes him to the resentments of many, they give out that he
   is deranged. Let us learn, in the second place, that the light of faith
   does not proceed from flesh and blood, but from heavenly grace, that no
   man may glory in any thing else than in the regeneration of the Spirit;
   as Paul tells us,

   If any man wishes to be considered to be in Christ,
   let him be a new creature, (2 Corinthians 5:17.)

   Matthew 12:22. Then was brought to him. Luke explains from the effect,
   that the devil by which the man was possessed was dumb; but Matthew
   says, that a twofold plague had been inflicted on the man. Many
   persons, no doubt, are blind and deaf on account of natural defects;
   but it is evident, that this man had become blind, and had been
   deprived of the use of speech, though there was no defect in his
   optical nerves, [104] or in the proportion of his tongue. We need not
   wonder that so much liberty should be allowed to Satan in injuring the
   bodily senses, when God justly permits him to corrupt or pervert all
   the faculties of the soul.

   23. And all the people were astonished. Hence we infer, that there was
   a visible display of the power of God, which drew upon him the
   admiration of the great body of the people, who were not at all
   actuated by any wicked disposition. For how came it that all admired,
   but because the fact compelled them to do so? And certainly there is
   not one of us, who does not see in this narrative, as in a mirror, an
   unwonted power of God: and hence it follows, that a diabolical venom
   must have seized the minds of the scribes, who were not ashamed to
   slander so remarkable a work of God. But we must attend to the result
   of the miracle. Moved with admiration, those who saw it ask each other,
   Is not Jesus the Christ? Acknowledging the power of God, they are led,
   as it were by the hand, to faith. Not that they suddenly profited as
   much as they ought to have done, (for they speak doubtfully;) but yet
   it is no small proficiency to be aroused to consider more attentively
   the glory of Christ. Some look upon this as a full affirmation, but the
   words convey no such meaning; and the fact itself shows, that an
   unexpected occurrence had struck them forcibly, and that they did not
   form a decided opinion, but only that it occurred to them that he might
   be the Christ.

   24. But when the Pharisees heard it. The scribes cannot withhold the
   acknowledgment of a fact so open and manifest, and yet they maliciously
   carp [105] at what Christ did by Divine power. Not only do they obscure
   the praise of the miracle, but endeavor to turn it into a reproach, as
   if it were performed by magical enchantment; and that work, which could
   not be ascribed to a man, is alleged by them to have the devil for its
   author. Of the word Beelzebub I have spoken under the Tenth Chapter,
   [106] and of the prince of the devils I have said a little under the
   Ninth Chapter. [107] The opinion expressed by the scribes, that there
   is a prince among wicked spirits, did not arise from a mistake of the
   common people, or from supposition, but from a conviction entertained
   among the godly, that the reprobate have a head, in the same manner as
   Christ is the Head of the Church.

   I cast out devils, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
   29. Otherwise, how can a man enter into the house of a strong man, and
   pillage his property, unless he first bind the strong man, and then he
   will pillage his house? 30. He that is not with me is against me; and
   he that gathereth not with me scattereth. 31. Therefore I say to you,
   All sin and blasphemy [110] shall be forgiven to men; but the blasphemy
   against the Spirit shall not be forgiven to men. 32. And whosoever
   shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him;
   but he who shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be
   forgiven him, neither in the present life nor in the future.

   23. And having called them to him, he spoke in parables, How can Satan
   cast out Satan? 24. And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that
   kingdom cannot stand. 25. And if a house be divided against itself,
   that house cannot stand. 26. And if Satan hath risen up against
   himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end. [111] 27. No
   man can enter into the house of a strong man, and pillage his property,
   unless he first bind the strong man, and then he will pillage his
   house. 28. Verily I say to you, All sins shall be forgiven to the sons
   of men, and blasphemies with which they shall blaspheme: 29. But he who
   shall speak blasphemy against the Holy Spirit hath not forgiveness to
   eternity, [112] but is exposed to eternal judgment. 30. For they said,
   He hath an unclean spirit. [113]

   16. And others tempting him sought from him a sign from heaven. 17. But
   as he knew their thoughts, [114] he said to them, Every kingdom divided
   against itself is laid waste, and a house against a house falleth.
   [115] 18. But if Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his
   kingdom stand? for you say that by Beelzebub I cast out devils. 19. But
   if I cast out devils by Beelzebub, by whom do your children cast them
   out? therefore they shall be your judges. 20. But if I cast out devils
   by the finger of God, truly has the kingdom of God come to you.
   21. When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his property is at
   peace; 22. But when a stronger than he cometh upon him, and overcometh
   him, he taketh from him all his armor, in which he trusted, and
   divideth his spoils. 23. He that is not with me is against me, and he
   that gathereth not with me scattereth.

   Luke 12:10.

   And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be
   forgiven him; but he who shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit, it
   shall not be forgiven him.


   Matthew 12:25. But as Jesus knew their thoughts. Though Christ knew
   sufficiently well, and had often learned by experience, that the
   scribes, in the exercise of their malice [116] were in the habit of
   putting an unfavorable construction on every thing that he did, yet
   Matthew and Luke, I have no doubt, mean that Christ was a discerner of
   their hearts. [117] And indeed it is probable, that they spoke so
   openly against Christ, that their calumnies reached his ears; but
   Christ knew by his Divine Spirit the dispositions which led them to
   slander him. For it frequently happens that erroneous judgments are
   formed by men who do not intentionally, after all, oppose what is
   right, but err through ignorance; who do not cherish a hidden and
   concealed venom, but whose rashness carries them headlong. [118] The
   meaning therefore is, that Christ reproved them with the greater
   severity, because he was a witness and judge of their inward malice.

   Every kingdom divided against itself. In refuting the calumny alleged
   against him, he first quotes a common proverb. This refutation may
   appear to be not quite satisfactory. We know what subtle methods Satan
   sometimes employs, presenting all the while an appearance of discord,
   in order to entrap the minds of men by superstitions. Thus, for
   example, the exorcisms of Popery are nothing else than feats of
   dexterity, in which Satan pretends to fight with himself. But no
   suspicion of this nature fell on Christ; for he cast out devils in such
   a manner, as to restore to God the men in whom they dwelt sound and
   whole. Whenever Satan enters into a collusion with himself, he pretends
   to be vanquished, and yet it is himself that triumphs. But Christ
   attacked Satan in open combat, threw him down, and left him nothing
   remaining. He did not lay him low in one respect, that he might give
   him greater stability in another, but stripped him completely of all
   his armor. Christ therefore reasons justly, that there is no community
   of interest between him and Satan, because that father of cunning [119]
   keeps one object in view -- the preservation of his kingdom.

   But perhaps it will be objected, that the devils are often hurried
   along, by giddiness and blind madness, to destroy themselves. The
   answer is easy. The words of Christ mean nothing more than that it was
   absurd in the scribes to maintain, that the devil, who endeavors by
   every method to make men his slaves, should, of his own accord, destroy
   the power which he possessed over them. Besides, it ought to be
   remembered, that common proverbs were employed by Christ in such a
   manner, as to be merely probable conjectures, and not solid arguments;
   and that, when he speaks of what is known and well attested, he finds
   it easier to reach the conscience of his adversaries. [120] Everybody
   knew that Christ had driven Satan from his possession, and nothing was
   plainer than that all his miracles tended to this object; and hence it
   was easy to conclude, that his power, which was so much opposed to
   Satan, was divine.

   27. By whom do your children cast them out? He charges them with
   passing an unjust and malicious decision, because in the same case they
   did not decide in a similar manner, but as they were affected towards
   the persons. Now this inequality shows, that their prevailing motive
   was not a regard to what is just and right, but blind love or hatred;
   and that it was even an evidence of wicked self-love (philautias) and
   envy, to condemn in Christ what they praised in their own children By
   your children some understand the children of the whole nation; and
   some think that the Apostles are so called, because they were
   acknowledged to be children, while Christ was treated as if he had been
   a foreigner. [121] Others refer it to the ancient Prophets. I have no
   doubt that he means the Exorcists, who were at that time generally
   employed among the Jews, as is evident from the Acts of the Apostles,
   (19:19.) There is reason to believe, that no greater kindness would be
   exercised in judging of the disciples of Christ than of their Master;
   and to apply these words to the dead is a forced construction, when
   they manifestly denote a comparison of the present time.

   There was indeed no statute of the Law for having Exorcists among the
   Jews; but we know that God, in order to maintain their fidelity to his
   covenant, and their purity of worship, often testified his presence
   among them by a variety of miracles. It is even possible that there
   were persons who cast out devils by calling on the name of the Lord;
   and the people, having experienced such a display of the power of God,
   rashly concluded that it was an ordinary office. [122] The Papists
   afterwards, resolving not to occupy a lower rank, imitated them by
   creating Exorcists; and in this way were apes of apes. Besides, it was
   not necessary that Christ should approve of those exorcisms, in order
   to point out the malice of those who wished to have them regarded as
   sacred, and as authorized by the name of God; for the objection was, as
   we say, of a personal nature. [123]

   Therefore they shall judge concerning you. These words are not to be
   taken literally, but the meaning is: "We need not go far to seek your
   condemnation. You attribute to Beelzebub the miracles which I have
   performed, and you praise the same things in your own children. You
   have at home what is sufficient to condemn you." But if any one prefer
   to understand them differently, as reproaching them with the grace of
   God, which was sometimes exhibited through the Exorcists, I do not
   greatly object to that view. Though they were greatly degenerated, yet
   the Lord was pleased not to leave them altogether without evidences of
   his power, that there might be some testimony to authorize the
   priesthood in general, and the service of the temple; for it was of the
   highest importance that there should be evident marks to distinguish
   them from the superstitions of the Gentiles. I look upon the former
   view, however, as the natural one.

   28. But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God. Luke says, if I cast
   out devils by The Finger of God; employing the word Finger
   metaphorically instead of the Spirit. As God works, and exerts his
   power, by his Spirit, it is with propriety that the word Finger is
   applied to him. And this mode of expression was common among the Jews,
   as Moses relates that Pharaoh's magicians said, This is the finger of
   God Now Christ infers from what he has already stated, that the scribes
   prove themselves to be ungrateful to God, by being unwilling that He
   should reign among them. Hitherto, he replied to their idle calumny;
   but now, he treats them as convicted persons, and charges them not to
   make ungodly opposition to the kingdom of God. He does not confine
   himself to a single miracle, but takes occasion from it to discourse on
   the object of his coming, reminds them that they ought not merely to
   look at one remarkable fact, but at a far more important truth, that it
   was the will of God, by revealing His Messiah, to raise up their
   salvation which was fallen, and to restore his kingdom among them. Thus
   we see that Christ complains of their ingratitude, in madly rejecting
   from the midst of them the inestimable grace of God. The kingdom of God
   hath come to you The word come is emphatic, and implies that, without
   any request from them, God appears as their Redeemer, while they do
   everything that is in their power to drive him away, and, when he is
   present and prepared for their salvation, refuse to give him a place.

   29. How can any one enter into the house of a strong man? Though the
   Evangelists differ a little as to words, there is a perfect agreement
   among them as to the substance of this discourse. Christ is pursuing
   the subject, on which he had lately touched, about the kingdom of God,
   and declares it to be necessary that Satan be violently driven out, in
   order that God may establish his kingdom among men. What he now states
   is nothing else than a confirmation of the preceding statement. But to
   ascertain more fully the intention of Christ, we must call to our
   recollection that analogy which Matthew (8:17) traces between the
   visible and the spiritual layouts which Christ bestows. [124] Every
   benefit which the bodies of men received from Christ was intended to
   have a reference to their souls. Thus, in rescuing the bodily senses of
   men from the tyranny of the devil, he proclaimed that the Father had
   sent him as a Deliverer, to destroy his spiritual tyranny over their
   souls.

   I now return to his words. He maintains that a strong and powerful
   tyrant cannot be deprived of his dominion, till he is stripped of his
   armor; for if he is not met by a force superior to his own, he will
   never yield of his own accord. Why is this asserted? First, we know
   that the devil is everywhere called the prince of the world Now the
   tyranny which he exercises is defended on every side by strong
   ramparts. His snares for entrapping men are beyond all calculation;
   nay, men are already his slaves, and so firmly bound by a variety of
   fetters, that they rather cherish the slavery, to which they are
   devoted, than make any aspirations after freedom. There are also
   innumerable evils which he inflicts upon them, by which he holds them
   in wretched oppression under his feet. In short, there is nothing to
   prevent him from tyrannizing over the world without control. Not that
   he can do anything without the permission of the Creator, but because
   Adam, having withdrawn from the dominion of God, has subjected all his
   posterity to this foreign sway.

   Now though it is contrary to nature that the devil reigns, and though
   it is by, just punishment of God, on account of sin, that men are
   subjected to his tyranny, yet he remains in quiet possession of his
   kingdom, and may insult us at his pleasure, till a stronger than he
   shall rise up against him. But this stronger person is not to be found
   on earth, for men have not sufficient power to relieve themselves; and
   therefor it was promised that a Redeemer would come from heaven. Now
   this kind of redemption Christ shows to be necessary, in order to
   wrench from the devil, by main force, what he will never quit till he
   is compelled. By these words he informs us, that it is in vain for men
   to expect deliverance, till Satan has been subdued by a violent
   struggle. [125]

   He expressly accuses the scribes of ignorance, in not understanding the
   principles of the kingdom of God. But this reproof applies almost
   equally to all, for all are chargeable with the same folly. There is no
   man who does not loudly boast that he desires the kingdom of God; and
   yet we do not permit Christ to fight boldly, as the occasion requires,
   in order to rescue us from the power of our tyrant; just as if a sick
   man were to entreat the aid of a physician, and then to refuse every
   remedy. We now see the reason why Christ introduced this parable. It
   was to show, that the scribes were hostile to the kingdom of God, the
   beginnings of which they maliciously resisted. Let us also learn that,
   as we are all subject to the tyranny of Satan, there is no other way in
   which he commences his reign within us, than when he rescues us, by the
   powerful and victorious arm of Christ, from that wretched and accursed
   bondage.

   30. He that is not with me. There are two ways of explaining this
   passage. Some suppose that it is an argument drawn from contraries, and
   that Christ's meaning is: "I cannot reign till the devil is overthrown;
   for the object of all his attempts is, to scatter whatever I gather."
   And certainly we see abundant evidence of the earnestness with which
   that enemy labors to destroy the kingdom of Christ. But I rather agree
   in opinion with those who explain it to denote, that the scribes are
   declared to be, in two respects, opposed to the kingdom of God, because
   they intentionally hinder its progress. "It was your duty to assist me,
   and to give me your hand in establishing the kingdom of God; for
   whoever does not assist is, in some measure, opposed to me, or, at
   least, deserves to be reckoned among enemies. What then shall be said
   of you, whose furious rage drives you into avowed opposition?" [126]

   And he that gathereth not with me scattereth The truth of this is
   abundantly manifest from what has been already said; for so strong is
   our propensity to evil, that the justice of God can have no place but
   in those who apply to it in good earnest. This doctrine has a still
   more extensive bearing, and implies that they are unworthy to be
   considered as belonging to the flock of Christ, who do not apply to it
   all the means that are in their power; because their indolence tends to
   retard and ruin the kingdom of God, which all of us are called to
   advance.

   31. Therefore I say to you. This inference ought not to be confined to
   the clause immediately preceding, but depends on the whole discourse.
   Having proved that the scribes could not blame him for casting out
   devils, without opposing the kingdom of God, he at length concludes
   that it is no light or ordinary offense, but an atrocious crime,
   knowingly and willingly to pour contempt on the Spirit of God. We have
   already said, that Christ did not pronounce this decision on the mere
   words which they uttered, but on their base and wicked thought.

   All sin and blasphemy. As our Lord declares blasphemy against the Holy
   Ghost to be more heinous than all other sins, it is of importance to
   inquire what is the meaning of that term. Those who define it to be
   impenitence [127] may be refuted without any difficulty; for it would
   have been in vain and to no purpose for Christ to say, that it is not
   forgiven in the present life. Besides, the word blasphemy cannot be
   extended indiscriminately to every sort of crimes; but from the
   comparison which Christ makes, we shall easily obtain the true
   definition. Why is it said that he who blasphemes against the Spirit is
   a more heinous sinner than he who blasphemes against Christ? Is it
   because the majesty of the Spirit is greater, that a crime committed
   against him must be punished with greater severity? Certainly that is
   not the reason; for as the fullness of the Godhead (Colossians 2:9)
   shines in Christ, he who pours contempt upon him overturns and
   destroys, as far as it lies in his power, the whole glory of God. Now
   in what manner shall Christ be separated from his Spirit, so that those
   who treat the Spirit with contempt offer no injury or insult to Christ?

   Already we begin to perceive, that the reason why blasphemy against the
   Spirit exceeds other sins, is not that the Spirit is higher than
   Christ, but that those who rebel, after that the power of God has been
   revealed, cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance. Besides, it must
   be observed, that what is here said about blasphemy does not refer
   merely to the essence of the Spirit, but to the grace which He has
   bestowed upon us. Those who are destitute of the light of the Spirit,
   however much they may detract from the glory of the Spirit, will not be
   held guilty of this crime. [128] We do not maintain, that those persons
   are said to pour contempt on the Spirit of God, who oppose his grace
   and power by hardened malice; and farther we maintain, that this kind
   of sacrilege is committed only when we knowingly endeavor to extinguish
   the Spirit who dwells in us.

   The reason why contempt is said to be poured on the Spirit, rather than
   on the Son or the Father, is this. By detracting from the grace and
   power of God, we make a direct attack on the Spirit, from whom they
   proceed, and in whom they are revealed to us. Shall any unbeliever
   curse God? It is as if a blind man were dashing against a wall. But no
   man curses the Spirit who is not enlightened by him, and conscious of
   ungodly rebellion against him; for it is not a superfluous distinction.
   that all other blasphemies shall be forgiven, except that one blasphemy
   which is directed against the Spirit. If a man shall simply blaspheme
   against God, he is not declared to be beyond the hope of pardon; but of
   those who have offered outrage to the Spirit, it is said that God will
   never forgive them. Why is this, but because those only are blasphemers
   against the Spirit, who slander his gifts and power, contrary to the
   conviction of their own mind? Such also is the import of the reason
   assigned by Mark for the extreme severity of Christ's threatening
   against the Pharisees; because they had said that he had the unclean
   spirit; for in this manner they purposely and maliciously turned light
   into darkness; and, indeed, it is in the manner of the giants, [129] as
   the phrase is, to make war against God.

   But here a question arises. Do men proceed to such a pitch of madness
   as not to hesitate, knowingly and willfully, to rush against God? for
   this appears to be monstrous and incredible. I reply: Such audacity
   does indeed proceed from mad blindness, in which, at the same time,
   malice and virulent rage predominate. Nor is it without reason that
   Paul says, that though he was

   a blasphemer, he obtained pardon, because he had done it ignorantly in
   his unbelief,
   (1 Timothy 1:13;)

   for this term draws a distinction between his sin and voluntary
   rebellion. This passage refutes also the error of those who imagine
   that every sin which is voluntary, or which is committed in opposition
   to the conscience, is unpardonable. On the contrary, Paul expressly
   limits that sin to the First Table of the Law; [130] and our Lord not
   less plainly applies the word blasphemy to a single description of sin,
   and at the same time shows, that it is of a kind which is directly
   opposed to the glory of God. [131]

   From all that has been said, we may conclude that those persons sin and
   blaspheme against the Holy Spirit, who maliciously turn to his dishonor
   the perfections of God, which have been revealed to him by the Spirit,
   in which His glory ought to be celebrated, and who, with Satan, their
   leader, are avowed enemies of the glory of God. We need not then
   wonder, if for such sacrilege there is no hope of pardon; for they must
   be desperate who turn the only medicine of salvation into a deadly
   venom. Some consider this to be too harsh, and betake themselves to the
   childish expedient, that it is said to be unpardonable, because the
   pardon of it is rare and difficult to be obtained. But the words of
   Christ are too precise to admit of so silly an evasion. It is
   excessively foolish to argue that God will be cruel if he never pardon
   a sin, the atrocity of which ought to excite in us astonishment and
   horror. [132] Those who reason in that manner do not sufficiently
   consider what a monstrous crime it is, not only to profane
   intentionally the sacred name of God, but to spit in his face when he
   shines evidently before us. It shows equal ignorance to object, that it
   would be absurd if even repentance could not obtain pardon; for
   blasphemy against the Spirit is a token of reprobation, and hence it
   follows, that whoever have fallen into it, have been delivered over to
   a reprobate mind, (Romans 1:28.) As we maintain, that he who has been
   truly regenerated by the Spirit cannot possibly fall into so horrid a
   crime, so, on the other hand, we must believe that those who have
   fallen into it never rise again; nay, that in this manner God punishes
   contempt of his grace, by hardening the hearts of the reprobate, so
   that they never have any desire towards repentance.

   32. Neither in the present life What these words mean, Mark briefly
   explains by saying, that those who have spoken against the Spirit are
   exposed to eternal judgment Every day we ask from God the forgiveness
   of sins, and every day he reconciles us to Him; and, finally, at death,
   he takes away all our sins, and declares that he is gracious to us. The
   fruit of this mercy will appear at the last day. The meaning therefore
   is: -- "There is no reason to expect that those who shall have
   blasphemed against the Spirit will obtain pardon in this life, or will
   be acquitted in the last judgment."

   With regard to the inference drawn by the Papists, that the sins of men
   are forgiven after death, there is no difficulty in refuting their
   slander. First, they act foolishly in torturing the expression, future
   life, to mean an intermediate period, while any one may perceive that
   it denotes "the last judgment." But it is likewise a proof of their
   dishonesty; for the objection which they sophistically urge is
   inconsistent with their own doctrine. Who knows not their distinction,
   that sins are freely pardoned in respect of guilt, but that punishment
   and satisfaction are demanded? This is an acknowledgment, that there is
   no hope of salvation to any one whose guilt is not pardoned before
   death. To the dead, therefore, there remains no forgiveness, except as
   regards punishment; and surely they will not venture to deny that the
   subject of this discourse is guilt. Let them now go and light their
   fire of purgatory with these cold materials, if ice can kindle a flame.

   MATTHEW 12:33-37

   Matthew 12:33-37

   33. Either make the tree good, and its fruit good: or make the tree
   bad, and its fruit bad; for the tree is known by the fruit.
   34. Offspring of vipers, how can you speak what is good, when you are
   bad? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. 35. A
   good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth what is
   good, and a bad man, out of the bad treasure, bringeth forth what is
   evil. 36. But I say to you, That men will give account, at the day of
   judgment, for every idle word which they shall have spoken. 37. For by
   thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be
   condemned.


   33. Either make the tree good It might look like absurdity, that men
   should be allowed a choice of being either good or bad; but if we
   consider what sort of persons Christ is addressing, the difficulty will
   be speedily resolved. We know what opinion was generally entertained
   about the Pharisees; for their pretended sanctity had so blinded the
   minds of the common people, that no one ventured to pass sentence on
   their vices. [134] Wishing to remove this mask, Christ desires them to
   be either good or bad; or, in other words, declares that nothing is
   more inconsistent with honesty than hypocrisy, and that it is in vain
   for men to boast of pretensions to righteousness who are not sincere
   and upright. [135] So then he puts nothing at their disposal, and
   withdraws no restraint from them, but only reminds them that their
   empty professions will avail them nothing so long as they are double,
   because they must be either good or bad

   From the expression, make the tree, some foolishly infer, that it is in
   every man's power to regulate his own life and conduct. It is a
   rhetorical mode of speaking, by which Christ points out the scribes,
   dispels--so to speak--the smoke of their hypocrisy, and recalls them to
   pure and genuine uprightness. He afterwards explains the way and manner
   in which they may show that they are good or bad trees; which is by
   yielding good or bad fruit: so that there is no ambiguity in the
   meaning. The life of the scribes was not rendered infamous among men by
   gross vices. Pride, ambition, and envy, displayed their venom in the
   slanders which they uttered; but as that venom was not perceived by
   ignorant people, Christ brings the concealed evil from its
   lurking-place, and drags it forth to light.

   But perhaps it will be objected that, in consequence of the corruption
   of our nature, it is impossible to find any man who is altogether
   upright, and free from every vice. The answer is ready. Christ does not
   demand absolute and entire perfection, but only a sincere and unfeigned
   disposition, which the Pharisees whom he addresses were far from
   possessing. As Scripture applies the terms, bad and wicked, to those
   who are completely given up to Satan, so the sincere worshippers of
   God, though they are encompassed by the infirmity of their flesh and by
   many sins, and groan under the burden, are called good. This arises
   from the undeserved kindness of God, who bestows so honorable a
   designation on those who aim at goodness.

   34. Offspring of vipers. The similarity between the tree and the fruit
   is here applied by Christ to nothing more than speech, because this
   afforded an opportunity of detecting the inward and concealed malice of
   the scribes; and that is the reason why he dwells so much on this one
   kind of sin. It is because their falsehood and slanders betrayed what
   was not so visible in the rest of their life, that Christ attacks them
   with such severity. "There is no reason to wonder," he says, "that you
   vomit out wicked words; for your heart is full of malice." Nor are we
   to suppose that he ought to have treated them with greater gentleness,
   because some might regard this reproof as excessively severe. There are
   other sins, no doubt, that call for harsh reproofs; but when
   hypocritical persons pervert what is right, or put a false coloring on
   what is sinful, such wickedness renders it necessary that God should
   thunder against it in a more terrible manner than against other sins.

   Now the design of Christ, suggested by the present occurrence, was to
   condemn the wicked sophistry which turns light into darkness. This
   passage shows how highly valuable in the sight of the Lord truth is,
   since he maintains and defends it with such rigor. Would that this were
   earnestly considered by those persons, whose ingenuity is too ready to
   be employed in defending any cause, and whose venal tongue disguises
   impostures! In a particular manner, Christ waxes wroth against those
   whom ambition, or envy, or some other fraudulent design, prompts to
   slander, even when there is nothing that their conscience condemns.
   Against the Pharisees, too, as his custom was, Christ used greater
   harshness, because they were so captivated by an unfounded conviction
   of their righteousness, that an ordinary warning had no effect upon
   them. And till hypocrites are sharply pierced, [136] all that is said
   to them is treated with scorn and contempt.

   How can you speak what is good? We have formerly hinted, that
   proverbial sayings ought not to be rigidly interpreted as an invariable
   rule, for they state nothing more than the ordinary fact. Sometimes, no
   doubt, a cruel man will deceive the simple by honied flatteries, a
   cunning man will cheat under the garb of simplicity, and a man of very
   wicked thoughts will breathe almost angelical purity of language. [137]
   But the ordinary practice demonstrates the truth of what Christ here
   says, that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh;
   agreeably to the old proverb, which declared the tongue to be the index
   of the mind. [138] And, indeed, whatever hidden and crooked recesses
   may exist in the heart of man, and whatever may be the amazing
   contrivances by which every man conceals his vices, yet the Lord
   extorts from each of them some kind of confession, so that they
   discover by the tongue their natural disposition and hidden feelings.
   We must also observe the purpose for which Christ employs those
   parables; for he reproaches the Pharisees with having manifested by
   words the malice which they had inwardly conceived. Besides, knowing
   them to be sworn enemies, he takes occasion from, single calumny to
   expose their whole life, and to destroy their credit with the people,
   which gave them too great influence in deceiving and in doing mischief.
   Though good speeches do not always proceed from the inmost heart, but
   originate (as the phrase is) on the tip of the tongue, yet it is an
   invariable truth, that bad speeches are indications of a bad heart.

   36. Of every idle word This is an argument from the less to the
   greater; for if every idle word is to be called in question, how would
   God spare the open blasphemies and sacrilegious insolence of those who
   bark against his glory? [139] An idle word means one that is useless,
   or that yields no edification or advantage. Many look upon this as too
   severe; [140] but if we consider the purpose for which our tongues were
   made, we will acknowledge, that those men are justly held guilty who
   unthinkingly devote them to trifling fooleries, and prostitute them to
   such a purpose. It is no light fault to abuse, for frivolous purposes,
   the time, which Paul enjoins us to be careful to redeem, (Ephesians
   5:16; Colossians 4:5.)

   Now since no man is so cautious in speech, or maintains such a wise
   restraint upon himself, as never to allow some idle words to escape
   him, there remains for all of us absolute despair, if the Lord should
   treat us with rigor. But as the confident hope of our salvation rests
   on the assurance that God will not enter into judgment with us, (Psalm
   143:2,) but will bury in gracious forgetfulness the sins which deserve
   innumerable deaths, [141] we entertain no doubt that, when he removes
   the condemnation of our whole life, he will likewise pardon the guilt
   of idle talking. When the judgment of God is mentioned in Scripture, it
   does not in any way set aside the forgiveness of sins. And yet let no
   man indulge himself, but let every man earnestly endeavor to bridle his
   tongue, (James 1:26.) First, let us speak of the sacred mysteries of
   God with the utmost reverence and sobriety; secondly, let us abstain
   from talkativeness, buffoonery, and vain jests, and much more from
   slanderous attacks; and, lastly, let us endeavor to have our speech
   seasoned with salt, (Colossians 4:6.)

   37. By thy words thou shalt be justified This was a common proverb,
   which he applied to the present subject; for I have no doubt that this
   was a saying which the people had frequently in their mouths, that
   "every man is condemned or acquitted by his own acknowledgment." But
   Christ turns it to a meaning somewhat different, that a wicked speech,
   being the indication of concealed malice, is enough to condemn a man.
   The attempt which the Papists make to torture this passage, so as to
   set aside the righteousness of faith, is childish. A man is justified
   by his words, not because his speech is the ground of his
   justification, (for we obtain by faith the favor of God, so that he
   reckons us to be righteous persons;) but because pure speech [142]
   absolves us in such a manner, that we are not condemned as wicked
   persons by our tongue. Is it not absurd to infer from this, that men
   deserve a single drop of righteousness in the sight of God? On the
   contrary, this passage upholds our doctrine; for, although Christ does
   not here treat of the ground of our justification, yet the contrast
   between the two words points out the meaning of the word justify. The
   Papists reckon it absurd in us to say, that a man is justified by
   faith, because they explain the word justified to mean, that he
   becomes, and is, actually righteous; while we understand it to mean,
   that he is accounted righteous, and is acquitted before the tribunal of
   God, as is evident from numerous passages of Scripture. And is not the
   same thing confirmed by Christ, when he draws a contrast between
   justified and condemned?

   Matthew 12:43-45; Luke 11:24-26

   Matthew 12:43-45

   Luke 11:24-26

   43. But when the unclean spirit hath gone out of a man, he walketh
   through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth it not. 44. Then he
   saith, I will return to my house, whence I came out; and coming, he
   findeth it empty, and swept, and embellished. 45. Then he goeth away,
   and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and
   entering, he dwelleth there: and the last state of that man is worse
   than the first. [143] So shall it be also to this wicked generation.

   24. When the unclean spirit hath gone out of a man, he walketh through
   dry places, seeking rest; and not finding it, he saith, I will return
   to my house, whence I came out. 25. And when he is come, he findeth it
   swept and embellished. 26. Then he goeth, and taketh with him seven
   other spirits more wicked than himself; and entering, they dwell there:
   and the last state of that man is worse than the first.



   43. But when the unclean spirit hath gone out. He speaks of scribes and
   hypocrites of a similar character, who, despising the grace of God,
   enter into a conspiracy with the devil. Against such persons he
   pronounces that punishment which their ingratitude deserves. To make
   his doctrine more extensively useful, he points out, in a general
   manner, the condemnation that awaits those who, despising the grace
   offered to them, again open the door to the devil. But as almost every
   particle has great weight, there are some points that must be noticed
   in their order, before we come to treat the substance of the parable.

   What Christ says about the going out of the devil is intended to
   magnify the power and efficacy of the grace of God. Whenever God draws
   near to us, and, above all, when he approaches us in the person of his
   Son, the design is, to rescue us from the tyranny of the devil, and to
   receive us into his favor. This had been openly declared by Christ in
   the miracle which he had lately performed. As it is the peculiar office
   of Christ to banish wicked spirits, that they may no longer reign over
   men, the devil is justly said to go out of those men to whom Christ
   exhibits himself as a Redeemer. Though the presence of Christ is not
   efficacious to all, because unbelievers render it useless to them, yet
   he intended to point out why he visits us, what is implied in his
   coming, and how it is regarded by wicked spirits; for in every case in
   which Christ operates on men, the devils are drawn into a contest with
   him, and sink beneath his power. Let us, therefore, hold it to be a
   settled point, that the devil is cast out of us, whenever Christ shines
   upon us, and displays his grace towards us by some manifestation.

   Secondly, the wretched condition of the whole human race is here
   described to us; for it follows that the devil has a residence within
   man, since he is driven from it by the Son of God. Now what is here
   said relates not to one individual or to another, but to the whole
   posterity of Adam. And this is the glory of our nature, that the devil
   has his seat within us, and inhabits both the body and the soul. So
   much the more illustrious is the display of the mercy of God, when we,
   who were the loathsome dens of the devil, are made temples to Himself,
   and consecrated for a habitation of His Spirit.

   Thirdly, we have here a description of Satan's nature. He never ceases
   to do us injury, but is continually busy, and moves from one place to
   another. In a word, he directs all his efforts to accomplish our
   destruction; and above all, when he has been vanquished and put to
   flight by Christ, it only tends more to whet his rage and keenness to
   do us injury. [144] Before Christ makes us partakers of his energy, it
   seems as if it were in sport and amusement that this enemy reigns over
   us; [145] but when he has been driven out, he conceives resentment at
   having lost his prey, collects new forces, and arouses all his senses
   to attack us anew.

   He walketh through dry places. This is a metaphorical expression, and
   denotes that to dwell out of men is to him a wretched banishment, and
   resembles a barren wilderness. Such, too, is the import of the phrase,
   seeking rest, so long as he dwells out of men; for then he is
   displeased and tormented, and ceases not to labor by one means or by
   another, till he recover what he has lost. [146] Let us, therefore,
   learn that, as soon as Christ calls us, a sharper and fiercer contest
   is prepared for us. Though he meditates the destruction of all, and
   though the words of Peter apply to all without exception, that he

   goeth about as a roaring lion, and seeketh whom he may devour,
   (1 Peter 5:8,)

   yet we are plainly taught by these words of Christ, that Satan views
   with deeper hatred, and attacks with greater fierceness and rage, those
   who have been rescued from his snares. Such an admonition, however,
   ought not to inspire us with terror, but to arouse us to keep diligent
   watch, and to put on the spiritual armor, that we may make a brave
   resistance.

   44. He findeth it empty Christ is unquestionably describing those who,
   being destitute of the Spirit of God, are prepared for receiving the
   devil; for believers, in whom the Spirit of God efficaciously dwells,
   are fortified on all sides, so that no opening is left for Satan. The
   metaphor of a house swept and embellished is taken from men who find
   pleasure in the cleanness and neatness of their apartments; for to
   Satan no sight is beautiful but deformity itself, and no smell is sweet
   but filth and nastiness. The meaning therefore is, that Satan never
   finds a more appropriate habitation within us, than when, having parted
   with Christ, we receive Satan as a guest. [147] His highest delight is
   in that emptiness by which the neglect of divine grace is followed.
   [148]

   45. He taketh with him seven other spirits The number seven is here
   used indefinitely, as in many other passages. By these words Christ
   shows that if we fall from his grace, our subjection to Satan is
   doubled, so that he treats us with greater cruelty than before, and
   that this is the just punishment of our slothfulness. [149] Let us not
   then suppose that the devil has been vanquished by a single combat,
   because he has once gone out of us. On the contrary, let us remember
   that, as his lodgment within us was of old standing, ever since we were
   born, he has knowledge and experience of all the approaches by which he
   may reach us; and that, if there be no open and direct entrance, he has
   dexterity enough to creep in by small holes or winding crevices. [150]
   We must, therefore, endeavor that Christ, holding his reign within us,
   may block up all the entrances of his adversary. Whatever may be the
   fierceness or violence of Satan's attacks, they ought not to intimidate
   the sons of God, whom the invincible power of the Holy Spirit preserves
   in safety. We know that the punishment which is here threatened is
   addressed to none but those who despise the grace of God, and who, by
   extinguishing the light of faith, and banishing the desire of
   godliness, [151] become profane.

   Luke 11:27-28; 8:19-21

   Matthew 12:46-50

   Mark 3:31-35

   Luke 11:27-28

   46. And while he was still talking to the multitudes, lo, his mother
   and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak to him. 47. And one
   said to him, Lo, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to
   speak to thee. 48. But he answering said to him who had told him, Who
   is my mother, or who are my brethren? 49. And stretching out his hand
   toward his disciples, he said, Lo, my mother and my brethren. 50. For
   whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my
   brother, and sister, and mother.


   31. And his mother and brethren came, and standing without, sent to him
   to call him. [152] 32. And the multitude was sitting around him, and
   they say to him, Lo, thy mother and thy brethren without seek thee.
   33. And he answered, saying to them, Who is my mother and my brethren?
   34. And when he had looked all around on the disciples sitting around
   him, he said, Lo, my mother and my brethren. 35. For he who shall do
   the will of God is my brother, and my sister, and mother.

   27. And it happened while he was saying these things, a certain woman
   from among the multitude, raising her voice, said to him, Blessed is
   the womb that bore thee, and the breasts which thou hath sucked.
   28. but he said, Nay, rather, blessed are they that hear the word of
   God, and keep it.

   Luke 8:19-21

   19. And his mother and his brethren came to him, and could not reach
   him on account of the crowd. 20. And it was related and told him, Thy
   mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee. 21. Who
   answering said to them, My mother and my brethren are those who hear
   the word of God, and do it. [153]


   Luke 11:27. Blessed is the womb. By this eulogium the woman intended to
   magnify the excellence of Christ; for she had no reference to Mary,
   [154] whom, perhaps, she had never seen. And yet it tends in a high
   degree to illustrate the glory of Christ, that she pronounces the womb
   that bore him to be noble and blessed. Nor was the blessing
   inappropriate, but in strict accordance with the manner of Scripture;
   for we know that offspring, and particularly when endued with
   distinguished virtues, is declared to be a remarkable gift of God,
   preferable to all others. It cannot even be denied that God conferred
   the highest honor on Mary, by choosing and appointing her to be the
   mother of his Son. And yet Christ's reply is so far from assenting to
   this female voice, that it contains an indirect reproof.

   Nay, rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God. We see that
   Christ treats almost as a matter of indifference that point on which
   the woman had set a high value. And undoubtedly what she supposed to be
   Mary's highest honor was far inferior to the other favors which she had
   received; for it was of vastly greater importance to be regenerated by
   the Spirit of God than to conceive Christ, according to the flesh, in
   her womb; to have Christ living spiritually within her than to suckle
   him with her breasts. In a word, the highest happiness and glory of the
   holy Virgin consisted in her being a member of his Son, so that the
   heavenly Father reckoned her in the number of new creatures.

   In my opinion, however, it was for another reason, and with a view to
   another object, that Christ now corrected the saying of the woman. It
   was because men are commonly chargeable with neglecting even those
   gifts of God, on which they gaze with astonishment, and bestow the
   highest praise. This woman, in applauding Christ, had left out what was
   of the very highest consequence, that in him salvation is exhibited to
   all; and, therefore, it was a feeble commendation, that made no mention
   of his grace and power, which is extended to all. Christ justly claims
   for himself another kind of praise, not that his mother alone is
   reckoned blessed, but that he brings to us all perfect and eternal
   happiness. We never form a just estimate of the excellence of Christ,
   till we consider for what purpose he was given to us by the Father, and
   perceive the benefits which he has brought to us, so that we who are
   wretched in ourselves may become happy in him. But why does he say
   nothing about himself, and mention only the word of God? It is because
   in this way he opens to us all his treasures; for without the word he
   has no intercourse with us, nor we with him. Communicating himself to
   us by the word, he rightly and properly calls us to hear and keep it,
   that by faith he may become ours.

   We now see the difference between Christ's reply and the woman's
   commendation; for the blessedness, which she had limited to his own
   relatives, is a favor which he offers freely to all. He shows that we
   ought to entertain no ordinary esteem for him, because he has all the
   treasures of life, blessedness, and glory, hidden in him, (Colossians
   2:3,) which he dispenses by the word, that they may be communicated to
   those who embrace the word by faith; for God's free adoption of us,
   which we obtain by faith, is the key to the kingdom of heaven. The
   connection between the two things must also be observed. We must first
   hear, and then keep; for as faith cometh by hearing, (Romans 10:17,) it
   is in this way that the spiritual life must be commenced. Now as the
   simple hearing is like a transitory looking into a mirror, [155] as
   James says, (1:23,) he likewise adds, the keeping of the word, which
   means the effectual reception of it, when it strikes its roots deep
   into our hearts, and yields its fruit. The forgetful hearer, whose ears
   alone are struck by the outward doctrine, gains no advantage. On the
   other hand, they who boast that they are satisfied with the secret
   inspiration, and on this ground disregard the outward preaching, shut
   themselves out from the heavenly life. What the Son of God hath joined
   let not men, with wicked rashness, put asunder, (Matthew 19:6.) The
   Papists discover amazing stupidity by singing, in honor of Mary, those
   very words by which their superstition is expressly condemned, and who,
   in giving thanks, detach the woman's saying, and leave out the
   correction. [156] But it was proper that such a universal stupefaction
   should come upon those who intentionally profane, at their pleasure,
   the sacred word of God.

   Luke 8:19. And his mother and his brethren came to him. There is an
   apparent discrepancy here between Luke and the other two Evangelists;
   for, according to their arrangement of the narrative, they represent
   Christ's mother and cousins as having come, while he was discoursing
   about the unclean spirit, while he refers to a different occasion, and
   mentions only the woman's exclamation, which we have just now
   explained. But we know that the Evangelists were not very exact as to
   the order of dates, or even in detailing minutely every thing that
   Christ did or said, so that the difficulty is soon removed. Luke does
   not state at what precise time Christ's mother came to him; but what
   the other two Evangelists relate before the parable of the sower he
   introduces after it. The account which he gives of the exclamation of
   the woman from among the multitude bears some resemblance to this
   narrative; for inconsiderate zeal may have led her to exalt to the
   highest pitch what she imagined that Christ had unduly lowered.

   All the three Evangelists agree in stating, that while Christ was
   discoursing in the midst of a crowd of people, his mother and brethren
   came to him The reason must have been either that they were anxious
   about him, or that they were desirous of instruction; for it is not
   without some good reason that they endeavor to approach him, and it is
   not probable that those who accompanied the holy mother were
   unbelievers. Ambrose and Chrysostom accuse Mary of ambition, but
   without any probability. What necessity is there for such a conjecture,
   when the testimony of the Spirit everywhere bestows commendation on her
   distinguished piety and modesty? The warmth of natural affection may
   have carried them beyond the bounds of propriety: this I do not deny,
   but I have no doubt that they were led by pious zeal to seek his
   society. Matthew relates that the message respecting their arrival was
   brought by one individual: Mark and Luke say that he was informed by
   many persons. But there is no inconsistency here; for the message which
   his mother sent to call him would be communicated, as usually happens,
   from one hand to another, till at length it reached him.

   Matthew 12:48. Who is my mother? These words were unquestionably
   intended to reprove Mary's eagerness, and she certainly acted
   improperly in attempting to interrupt the progress of his discourse.
   [157] At the same time, by disparaging the relationship of flesh and
   blood, our Lord teaches a very useful doctrine; for he admits all his
   disciples and all believers to the same honorable rank, as if they were
   his nearest relatives, or rather he places them in the room of his
   mother and brethren Now this statement is closely connected with the
   office of Christ; for he tells us that he has been given, not to a
   small number of individuals, but to all the godly, who are united in
   one body with him by faith. He tells us also, that there is no tie of
   relationship more sacred than spiritual relationship, because we ought
   not to think of him according to the flesh, but according to the power
   of his Spirit which he has received from the Father to renew men, so
   that those who are by nature the polluted and accursed seed of Abraham
   begin to be by grace the holy and heavenly sons of God. In like manner,
   Paul affirms that to know Christ after the flesh is not to know him
   properly, (2 Corinthians 5:16,) because we ought rather to consider
   that renovation of the world, which far exceeds human power, and which
   takes place when he forms us anew by his Spirit to the image of God. To
   sum up the whole, this passage, first, teaches us to behold Christ with
   the eyes of faith; and, secondly, it informs us, that every one who is
   regenerated by the Spirit, and gives himself up entirely to God for
   true justification, is thus admitted to the closest union with Christ,
   and becomes one with him.

   50. For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven. When
   he says that they do the will of his Father, he does not mean that they
   fulfill, in a perfect manner, the whole righteousness of the law; for
   in that sense the name brother, which is here given by him to his
   disciples, would not apply to any man. [158] But his design is, to
   bestow the highest commendation on faith, which is the source and
   origin of holy obedience, and at the same time covers the defects and
   sins of the flesh, that they may not be imputed. This, says Christ in a
   well-known passage,

   is the will of my Father, that whosoever seeth the Son, and believeth
   in him, may not perish, but have eternal life,
   (John 6:40.)

   Although these words seem to imply that Christ has no regard to the
   ties of blood, yet we know that in reality he paid the strictest
   attention to human order, [159] and discharged his lawful duties
   towards relatives; but points out that, in comparison of spiritual
   relationship, no regard, or very little, is due to the relationship of
   the flesh. Let us therefore attend to this comparison, so as to perform
   all that nature can justly claim, and, at the same time, not to be too
   strongly attached to flesh and blood. Again, as Christ bestows on the
   disciples of his Gospel the inestimable honor of being reckoned as his
   brethren, we must be held guilty of the basest ingratitude, if we do
   not disregard all the desires of the flesh, and direct every effort
   towards this object.

   Matthew 12:38-42; Luke 11:16, 29-32

   Matthew 12:38-42

   Luke 11:16, 29-32

   38. Then some of the scribes and Pharisees asked him, saying, Master,
   we desire to see a sign from thee. 39. But he answering said to them, A
   wicked and adulterous generation seeketh a sign, [160] and a sign shall
   not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet. 40. For as
   Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights, so
   will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the
   earth. 41. The men of Nineveh will rise in judgment with this
   generation, and will condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of
   Jonah; and, lo, a greater than Jonah is here. [161] 42. The queen of
   the south will rise in judgment with this generation, and will condemn
   it: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of
   Solomon; and, lo, a greater than Solomon is here. [162]

   16. And others tempting, sought from him a sign from heaven. -- (A
   little after.) 29. And while the multitudes were crowding together, he
   began to say, This is a wicked generation: it seeketh a sign, and a
   sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet.
   30. For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so shall the Son of man
   be also to this nation. 31. The queen of the south will rise in
   judgment with the men of this nation, and will condemn them: for she
   came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, lo,
   a great than Solomon is here. 32. The men of Nineveh will rise in
   judgment with this nation, and will condemn it: for they were brought
   to repentance by the preaching of Jonah; and, lo, a greater than Jonah
   is here.


   Luke 11:16. And others tempting sought from him a sign. Something
   similar to this is afterwards related by Matthew, (16:4,) and by Mark,
   (8:11, 12.) Hence it is evident, that Christ repeatedly attacked them
   on this subject, so that there was no end to the wickedness of those
   men who had once resolved [163] to oppose the truth. There can be no
   doubt that they ask a sign, in order to plead, as a plausible pretense
   for their unbelief, that Christ's calling has not been duly attested.
   They do not express such submissiveness as to be prepared to yield to
   two or three miracles, and still less to be satisfied with a single
   miracle; but as I hinted a little before, they apologize for not
   believing the Gospel on this pretense, that Christ shows no sign of it
   from heaven. [164] He had already performed miracles before their eyes
   sufficiently numerous and manifest; but as if these were not enough for
   the confirmation of doctrine, they wish to have something exhibited
   from heaven, by which God will, as it were, make a visible appearance.
   They call him Master, according to custom; for such was the appellation
   given at that time to all scribes and expounders of the law. But they
   do not acknowledge him to be a prophet of God, till he produce a
   testimony from heaven. The meaning therefore is: "Since thou professest
   to be a teacher and Master, if thou desirest that we should be thy
   disciples, let God declare from heaven that He is the Author of thy
   teaching, and let Him confirm thy calling by a miracle."

   Matthew 12:39. A wicked generation He does not merely charge that age
   with malice, but pronounces the Jews--or at least the scribes, and
   those who resembled them--to be a wicked nation; thus declaring that
   they labored under a hereditary disease of obstinacy. The word genea
   sometimes denotes an age, and sometimes a people or nation. He calls
   them adulterous, that is, spurious or illegitimate, [165] because they
   were degenerated from the holy fathers; as the prophets reproach the
   men of their age with being not the descendants of Abraham, but the
   ungodly seed of Canaan.

   Seeks a sign. This leads to the inquiry, Does Christ address them with
   such harshness of language, because they wished to have a sign given
   them? for on other occasions God manifests that He is not so much
   displeased on this account. Gideon asks a sign, (Judges 6:17,) and God
   is not angry, but grants his request; and though Gideon becomes
   importunate and asks another sign, yet God condescends to his weakness.
   Hezekiah does not ask a sign, and it is offered to him, though
   unsolicited, (Isaiah 38:7,8.) Ahaz is severely blamed for refusing to
   ask a sign, as the prophet had enjoined him to do, (Isaiah 7:11.) It is
   not solely, therefore, because they ask a sign, that Christ makes this
   attack upon the scribes, but because they are ungrateful to God,
   wickedly despise so many of his wonderful works, and try to find a
   subterfuge for not obeying his word. What a display was this, I do not
   say of indifference, but of malice, in shutting their eyes against so
   many signs! There was, therefore, no proper ground for this annoyance;
   and they had no other object in view than to appear to have a good
   reason for rejecting Christ. Paul condemns their posterity for the same
   crime, when he says that the Jews require a sign, (1 Corinthians 1:22.)

   A sign shall not be given to it. They had already been convicted by
   various miracles, and Christ does not abstain from exerting his power
   among them, for the purpose of rendering them inexcusable, but only
   means that one sign would stand for all, because they were unworthy of
   having their ungodly desire granted. "Let them rest satisfied," says
   he, "with this sign, that as Jonah, brought up from the bottom of the
   sea, preached to the Ninevites, so they will hear the voice of a
   prophet risen from the dead." The most of commentators, I am aware,
   display greater ingenuity in expounding this passage; but as the
   resemblance between Christ and Jonah does not hold at every point, we
   must inquire in what respect Christ compares himself to Jonah. For my
   own part, leaving the speculations of other men, I think that Christ
   intends to mark out that single point of resemblance which I have
   already hinted, that he will be their prophet after that he is risen
   from the dead. "You despise," he says, "the Son of God, who has come
   down to you from heaven: but I am yet to die, and to rise from the
   grave, and to speak to you after my resurrection, as Jonah came from
   the bottom of the sea to Nineveh." In this manner our Lord cuts off
   every pretense for their wicked demands, by threatening that he will be
   their Prophet after his resurrection, since they do not receive him
   while clothed with mortal flesh.

   Luke 11:30. As Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites. He declares that he
   will be a sign to them, as Jonah was to the inhabitants of Nineveh. But
   the word sign is not taken in its ordinary sense, as pointing out
   something, but as denoting what is widely removed from the ordinary
   course of nature. In this sense Jonah's mission was miraculous, when he
   was brought out of the belly of the fish, as if from the grave, to call
   the Ninevites to repentance. Three days and three nights This is in
   accordance with a well-known figure of speech. [166] As the night is an
   appendage to the day, or rather, as the day consists of two parts,
   light and darkness, he expresses a day by a day and a night, and where
   there was half a day, he puts down a whole day.

   Matthew 12:41. The men of Nineveh will rise in judgment. Having spoken
   of the Ninevites, Christ takes occasion to show that the scribes and
   others, by whom his doctrine is rejected, are worse than the Ninevites
   were. "Ungodly men," he says, "who never had heard a word of the true
   God, repented at the voice of an unknown and foreign person who came to
   them; while this country, which is the sanctuary of heavenly doctrine,
   hears not the Son of God, and the promised Redeemer." Here lies the
   contrast which is implied in the comparison. We know who the Ninevites
   were, men altogether unaccustomed to hear prophets, and destitute of
   the true doctrine. Jonah had no rank to secure their respect, but was
   likely to be rejected as a foreigner. The Jews, on the other hand,
   boasted that among them the Word of God had its seat and habitation. If
   they had beheld Christ with pure eyes, [167] they must have
   acknowledged, not only that he was a teacher sent from heaven, but that
   he was the Messiah, and the promised Author of Salvation. But if that
   nation was convicted of desperate ungodliness, for despising Christ
   while he spoke to them on earth, we are worse than all the unbelievers
   that ever existed, if the Son of God, now that he inhabits his
   sanctuary in heaven, and addresses us with a heavenly voice, does not
   bring us to obey him. Whether the men of Nineveh were truly and
   perfectly turned to God I judge it unnecessary to inquire. It is enough
   for the present purpose that they were so deeply affected by the
   teaching of Jonah, as to have their minds directed to repentance.

   42. The queen of the south. As Ethiopia lies in a southerly direction
   from Judea, I willingly concur with Josephus and other writers, who
   assert that she was the queen of Ethiopia. In sacred history she is
   called the queen of Sheba, (2 Chronicles 9:1.) We must not suppose this
   Sheba to be the country of Saba, which rather lay toward the east, but
   a town situated in Meroe, an island on the Nile, which was the
   metropolis of the kingdom. Here, too, we must attend to the points of
   contrast. A woman who had not been at all educated in the school of
   God, was induced, by the desire of instruction, to come from a distant
   region to Solomon, an earthly king; while the Jews, who had been
   instructed in the divine law, reject their highest and only teacher,
   the Prince of all the prophets. The word condemn relates not to the
   persons, but to the fact itself, and the example which it yields.

   Matthew 13:1-17

   Mark 4:1-12, 24-25

   Luke 8:1-10, 18

   1. And on the same day Jesus went out of the house, and sat down near
   the sea. 2. And great multitudes were gathered to him, so that he
   entered into a ship, and sat down, and the whole multitude was standing
   on the shore. 3. And he said many things to them by parables, saying,
   Lo, one who was sowing, some seeds fell near the road, and the birds
   came and devoured them. 5. And some fell on stony places, where they
   had not much earth, and immediately they sprang up, because they had
   not depth of earth. 6. But when the sun rose, they were burnt up, and
   because they had not a root, they withered away. 7. Others again fell
   on thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked them. 8. And others fell
   on good soil, and yielded fruit: some a hundred-fold, some sixty-fold,
   some thirty-fold. 9. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. 10. And
   the disciples approaching said to him, Why dost thou speak to them by
   parables? 11. But he answering, said to them, To you it is given to
   know the mysteries [168] of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is
   not given, 12. For whosoever hath, it shall be given to him, and he
   shall be rendered more wealthy; [169] and whosoever hath not, even that
   which he hath shall be taken from him. 13. For this reason I speak to
   them in parables, because seeing, they do not see, and hearing, they do
   not hear nor understand. 14. And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
   Isaiah, which saith, With the ears you shall hear, and shall not
   understand, and seeing, you shall see, and shall not perceive. 15. For
   the heart of this people hath become gross, and with their ears they
   have heard heavily, and their eyes they have shut, lest at any time
   they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and
   understand with the heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
   16. But your eyes are blessed for they see; and your ears, for they
   hear. 17. Verily, I say to you, That many prophets and righteous men
   have desired to see the things which you see, and have not seen them,
   and to hear the things which you hear, and have not heard them.

   1. And again he began to teach near the sea, and a great multitude was
   gathered to him, so that, entering into a ship, he sat on the sea, and
   the whole multitude was near the sea on land. 2. And he taught them
   many things by parables, and said to them in his doctrine: 3. Hear, lo,
   a sower went out to sow. 4. And it happened while he was sowing, some
   fell closer to the road; and the fowls of heaven came and ate them up.
   5. And some fell on stony places, where it had not much earth, and
   immediately it sprang up, because it had not depth of earth. 6. And
   when the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had not a root,
   it withered. 7. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns grew, and
   choked it, and it did not yield fruit. 8. And some fell on good soil,
   and yielded fruit springing up and growing, and produced some thirty,
   and some sixty, and some a hundred. 9. And he said to them, He that
   hath ears to hear, let him hear. 10. And when he began to be alone,
   those who were around him, with the twelve, asked him about the
   parable. 11. And he said to them, To you it is given to know the
   mystery [170] of the kingdom of God, but to those who are without all
   things are done by parables: 12. That seeing, they may see and may not
   perceive, and hearing, they may hear and may not understand, lest at
   any time they may be converted, and their sins may be forgiven them. --
   (A little after,) 24. And he said to them, Observe what you hear: with
   what measure, the same admeasurement shall be made to you, and it shall
   be added to you who shall hear. 25. For to him who hath it shall be
   given; and he that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken
   away from him.


   1. And it happened afterwards, and he was traveling through each city
   and village, [171] preaching and proclaiming the glad tidings of the
   kingdom of God; and the twelve were with him, 2. And likewise some
   women, who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases, Mary, who is
   called Magdalene, out of whom had gone seven devils, 3. And Joanna, the
   wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who
   assisted him out of their property 4. And while a very great multitude
   was assembling, and while they were crowding to him out of each city,
   he said by a parable: 5. One who sowed went out to sow his seed, and
   while he was sowing, some fell near the road, and the fowls of heaven
   ate it up. 6. And some fell on a rock, and when it was sprung up, it
   withered, because it hath not moisture. 7. And some fell among thorns,
   and the thorns springing up along with it, choked it. 8. And some fell
   on a good soil, and, springing up, produced fruit a hundred-fold.
   Saying these things, he exclaimed, He that hath ears to hear, let him
   hear. 9. And his disciples asked him, saying, What was this parable?
   [172] 10. But he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries [173]
   of the kingdom of God, but to the rest by parables; that seeing, they
   may not see, and hearing, they may not understand. -- (A little after,)
   18. Consider then how you hear. For whosoever hath, it shall be given
   to him; and whosoever hath not, even that which he thinketh that he
   hath shall be taken from him.

   Luke 10:23-24.

   23. And turning to his disciples, he said to them privately, Blessed
   are the eyes that see the things which you see. 24. For I say to you,
   That many prophets and kings have desired to see the things which you
   see, and have not seen them; and to hear the things which you hear, and
   have not heard them.



   What I have here introduced from Luke belongs, perhaps, to another
   time; but I saw no necessity for separating what he has placed in
   immediate connection. First, he says that the twelve apostles preached
   the kingdom of God along with Christ; from which we infer that, though
   the ordinary office of teaching had not yet been committed to them,
   they constantly attended as heralds to procure an audience for their
   Master; and, therefore, though they held an inferior rank, they are
   said to have been Christ's assistants. Next, he adds, that among those
   who accompanied Christ were certain women, who had been cured of evil
   spirits and diseases, such as Mary Magdalene, who had been tormented by
   seven devils To be associated with such persons might be thought
   dishonorable; for what could be more unworthy of the Son of God than to
   lead about with him women who were marked with infamy? But this enables
   us more clearly to perceive that the crimes with which we were loaded
   before we believed, are so far from diminishing the glory of Christ,
   that they tend rather to raise it to a higher pitch. And, certainly, it
   is not said, that the Church which he elected was found by him to be
   without spot and blemish, but that he cleansed it with his blood, and
   made it pure and fair.

   The wretched and disgraceful condition of those women, now that they
   had been delivered from it, redounded greatly to the glory of Christ,
   by holding out public manifestations of his power and grace. At the
   same time, Luke applauds their gratitude in following their Deliverer,
   and disregarding the ridicule of the world. [174] Beyond all question,
   they were pointed at with the finger on every side, and the presence of
   Christ served for a platform to exhibit them; but they do not refuse to
   have their own shame made generally known, provided that the grace of
   Christ be not concealed. On the contrary, they willingly endure to be
   humbled, in order to become a mirror, by which he may be illustriously
   displayed.

   In Mary, the boundless goodness of Christ was displayed in an
   astonishing manner. A woman, who had been possessed by seven devils,
   and might be said to have been the meanest slave of Satan, was not
   merely honored to be his disciple, but admitted to enjoy his society.
   Luke adds the surname Magdalene, to distinguish her from the sister of
   Martha, and other persons of the name of Mary, who are mentioned in
   other passages, (John 11:1; 19:25.)

   Luke 8:3. Joanna, the wife of Chuza It is uncertain whether or not Luke
   intended his statement to be applied to those women in the same manner
   as to Mary To me it appears probable that she is placed first in order,
   as a person in whom Christ had given a signal display of his power; and
   that the wife of Chuza, and Susanna, matrons of respectability and of
   spotless reputation, are mentioned afterwards, because they had only
   been cured of ordinary diseases. Those matrons being wealthy and of
   high rank, it reflects higher commendation on their pious zeal, that
   they supply Christ's expenses out of their own property, and, not
   satisfied with so doing, leave the care of their household affairs, and
   choose to follow him, attended by reproach and many other
   inconveniences, through various and uncertain habitations, instead of
   living quietly and at ease in their own houses. It is even possible,
   that Chuza, Herod's steward, being too like his master, was strongly
   opposed to what his wife did in this matter, but that the pious woman
   overcame this opposition by the ardor and constancy of her zeal.

   Matthew 13:2. And great multitudes were gathered together to him. It is
   not without good reason that the Evangelists begin with informing us
   that, a vast multitude had assembled, and that when Christ beheld them,
   he was led to compare his doctrine to seed That multitude had been
   collected from various places: all were held in suspense; all were
   alike eager to hear, but not equally desirous to receive instruction.
   The design of the parable was to inform them, that the seed of
   doctrine, which is scattered far and wide, is not everywhere
   productive; because it does not always find a fertile and well
   cultivated soil. Christ declared that he was there in the capacity of a
   husbandman, who was going out to sow seed, but that many of his hearers
   resembled an uncultivated and parched soil, while others resembled a
   thorny soil; so that the labor and the very seed were thrown away. I
   forbear to make any farther inquiry into the meaning of the parable,
   till we come to the explanation of it; which, as we shall find, is
   shortly afterwards given by our Lord. It may only be necessary, for the
   present, to remind the reader, that if those who ran from distant
   places to Christ, like hungry persons, are compared to an unproductive
   and barren soil, we need not wonder if, in our own day, the Gospel does
   not yield fruit in many, of whom some are lazy and sluggish, others
   hear with indifference, and others are scarcely drawn even to hear.

   9. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. These words were intended
   partly to show that all were not endued with true understanding to
   comprehend what he said, and partly to arouse his disciples to consider
   attentively that doctrine which is not readily and easily understood by
   all. Indeed, he makes a distinction among the hearers, by pronouncing
   some to have ears, and others to be deaf. If it is next inquired, how
   it comes to pass that the former have ears, Scripture testifies in
   other passages, that it is the Lord who pierces the ears, (Psalm
   40:7,)and that no man obtains or accomplishes this by his own industry.

   10. The disciples approaching said to him. From the words of Matthew it
   is evident, that the disciples did not merely look to themselves, but
   wished also to consult the benefit of others. Being unable to
   comprehend the parable, they concluded that it would be as little
   understood by the people; and, therefore, they complain that Christ
   employed language from which his hearers could derive no profit. Now
   though parables are generally found to illustrate the subject of which
   they treat, yet the uninterrupted course of a metaphor may lead to
   obscurity. [175] So then Christ, in delivering this parable, intended
   to wrap up, in an allegory, what he might have said more plainly and
   fully, without a figure. [176] But now that the exposition is added,
   the figurative discourse has greater energy and force than if it had
   been simple: by which is meant, that it is not only fitted to produce a
   more powerful impression on the mind, but is also more clear. So highly
   important is the manner in which any thing is said. [177]

   11. To you it is given to know the mysteries [178] of the kingdom of
   heaven From this reply of Christ we learn, that the doctrine of
   salvation is proclaimed by God to men for various purposes; for Christ
   declares that he intentionally spoke obscurely, in order that his
   discourse might be a riddle to many, and might only strike their ears
   with a confused and doubtful sound. It will perhaps be objected, that
   this is inconsistent with that prophecy,

   I have not spoken in secret, nor in a dark corner: I said not in vain
   to the seed of Jacob, Seek me,
   (Isaiah 45:19;)

   or with the commendations which David pronounces on the Law, that it

   is a lamp to the feet, and that it giveth wisdom to little children
   (Psalm 119:105,130.)

   But the answer is easy: the word of God, in its own nature, is always
   bright, [179] but its light is choked by the darkness of men. Though
   the Law was concealed, as it were, by a kind of veil, yet the truth, of
   God shone brightly in it, if the eyes of many had not been blinded.
   With respect to the Gospel, Paul affirms with truth, that it is hidden
   to none but to the reprobate, and to those who are devoted to
   destruction, whose minds Satan hath blinded, (2 Corinthians 4:3,4.)
   Besides, it ought to be understood, that the power of enlightening
   which David mentions, and the familiar manner of teaching which Isaiah
   predicts, refer exclusively to the elect people.

   Still it remains a fixed principle, that the word of God is not
   obscure, except so far as the world darkens it by its own blindness.
   And yet the Lord conceals its mysteries, so that the perception of them
   may not reach the reprobate. [180] There are two ways in which he
   deprives them of the light of his doctrine. Sometimes he states, in a
   dark manner, what might be more clearly expressed; and sometimes he
   explains his mind fully, without ambiguity and without metaphor, but
   strikes their senses with dulness and their minds with stupidity, so
   that they are blind amidst bright sunshine.

   Such is the import of those dreadful threatenings, in which Isaiah
   forewarns, that he will be to the people a barbarian, speaking in a
   foreign and unknown language; that the prophetical visions will be to
   the learned a shut and sealed book, in which they cannot read; and that
   when the book shall be opened, all will be unlearned, and will remain
   in amazement, through inability to read, (Isaiah 28:11; 29:11.) Now
   since Christ has purposely dispensed his doctrine in such a manner,
   that it might be profitable only to a small number, being firmly seated
   in their minds, and might hold others in suspense and perplexity, it
   follows that, by divine appointment, the doctrine of salvation is not
   proclaimed to all for the same end, but is so regulated by his
   wonderful purpose, that it is not less a savor of death to death to the
   reprobate than a life-giving savor to the elect, (2 Corinthians
   2:15,16.) And that no one may dare to murmur, Paul declares, in that
   passage that whatever may be the effect of the Gospel, its savor,
   though deadly, is always a sweet savor to God.

   To ascertain fully the meaning of the present passage, we must examine
   more closely the design of Christ, the reason why, and the purpose for
   which, these words were spoken. First, the comparison is undoubtedly
   intended by Christ to exhibit the magnitude of the grace bestowed on
   his disciples, in having specially received what was not given
   indiscriminately to all. If it is asked, why this privilege was
   peculiar to the apostles, [181] the reason certainly will not be found
   in themselves, and Christ, by declaring that it was given to them,
   excludes all merit. [182] Christ declares that there are certain and
   elect men, on whom God specially bestows this honor of revealing to
   them his secrets, and that others are deprived of this grace. No other
   reason will be found for this distinction, except that God calls to
   himself those whom he has gratuitously elected.

   12. For whosoever hath, it shall be given to him. Christ pursues the
   subject which I have just mentioned; for he reminds his disciples how
   kindly God acts towards them, that they may more highly prize his
   grace, and may acknowledge themselves to be under deeper obligations to
   his kindness. The same words he afterwards repeats, but in a different
   sense, (Matthew 25:29;) for on that occasion the discourse relates to
   the lawful use of gifts. [183] But here he simply teaches, that more is
   given to the apostles than to the generality of men, because the
   heavenly Father is pleased to display in perfection his kindness
   towards them.

   He does not forsake the work of his own hand,
   (Psalm 138:8.)

   Those whom he has once begun to form are continually polished more and
   more, till they are at length brought to the highest perfection. The
   multiplied favors which are continually flowing from him to us, and the
   joyful progress which we make, spring from God's contemplation of his
   own liberality, which prompts him to an uninterrupted course of bounty.
   And as his riches are inexhaustible, [184] so he is never wearied with
   enriching his children. Whenever he advances us to a higher degree, let
   us remember that every increase of the favors which we daily receive
   from him flows from this source, that it is his purpose to complete the
   work, of our salvation already commenced. On the other hand, Christ
   declares that the reprobate are continually proceeding from bad to
   worse, till, at length exhausted, they waste away in their own poverty.

   And he that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken from him.
   This may appear to be a harsh expression; but instead of saying, that
   what the ungodly have not is taken from them, Luke softens the
   harshness and removes the ambiguity by a slight change of the words:
   and whosoever hath not, even that which he thinketh that he hath shall
   be taken from him. And indeed it frequently happens, that the reprobate
   are endued with eminent gifts, and appear to resemble the children of
   God: but there is nothing of real value about them; for their mind is
   destitute of piety, and has only the glitter of an empty show. Matthew
   is therefore justified in saying that they have nothing; for what they
   have is of no value in the sight of God, and has no permanency within.
   Equally appropriate is the statement of Luke, that the gifts, with
   which they have been endued, are corrupted by them, so that they shine
   only in the eyes of men, but have nothing more than splendor and empty
   display. Hence, also let us learn to aim at progress throughout our
   whole life; for God grants to us the taste of his heavenly doctrine on
   the express condition, that we feed on it abundantly from day to day,
   till we come to be fully satiated with it.

   The manner in which Mark introduces this sentence has some appearance
   of confusion. Consider, says our Lord, what you hear; and then, if they
   make due progress, he holds out the expectation of more plentiful
   grace: it shall be added to you that hear Lastly, follows the clause
   which agrees with the words of Matthew, but is inserted in the middle
   of a sentence which I expounded under the seventh chapter of Matthew;
   [185] for it is not probable that they are here placed in their proper
   order. The Evangelists, as we have remarked on former occasions, were
   not very exact in arranging Christ's discourses, but frequently throw
   together a variety of sayings uttered by him. Luke mixes this sentence
   with other discourses of Christ spoken at different times, and likewise
   points out a different purpose for which Christ used these words. It
   was that they might be attentive to his doctrine, and not permit the
   seed of life to pass away unimproved, which ought to be cordially
   received, and take root in their minds. "Beware," he says, "lest what
   has been given be taken away from you, if it yield no fruit."

   13. For this reason I speak by parables. He says that he speaks to the
   multitude in an obscure manner, because they are not partakers of the
   true light. And yet, while he declares that a veil is spread over the
   blind, that they may remain in their darkness, he does not ascribe the
   blame of this to themselves, but takes occasion to commend more highly
   the grace bestowed on the Apostles, because it is not equally
   communicated to all. He assigns no cause for it, except the secret
   purpose of God; for which, as we shall afterwards see more fully, there
   is a good reason, though it has been concealed from us. It is not the
   only design of a parable to state, in an obscure manner, what God is
   not pleased to reveal clearly; but we have said that the parable now
   under our consideration was delivered by Christ, in order that the form
   of an allegory might present a doubtful riddle.

   14. And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah. He confirms his
   statement by a prediction of Isaiah, that it is far from being a new
   thing, if many persons derive no advantage from the word of God, which
   was formerly appointed to the ancient people, for the purpose of
   inducing greater blindness. This passage of the Prophet is quoted, in a
   variety of ways, in the New Testament. Paul quotes it (Acts 28:26) to
   charge the Jews with obstinate malice, and says that they were blinded
   by the light of the Gospel, because they were bitter and rebellious
   against God. There he points out the immediate cause which appeared in
   the men themselves. But in the Epistle to the Romans (11:7) he draws
   the distinction from a deeper and more hidden source; for he tells us,
   that the remnant was saved according to the election of grace, and that
   the rest were blinded, according as it is written. The contrast must
   there be observed; for if it is the election of God, and an undeserved
   election, which alone saves any remnant of the people, it follows that
   all others perish by a hidden, though just, judgment of God. Who are
   the rest, whom Paul contrasts with the elect remnant, but those on whom
   God has not bestowed a special salvation?

   Similar reasoning may be applied to the passage in John, (12:38;) for
   he says that many believed not, because no man believes, except he to
   whom God reveals his arm, and immediately adds, that they could not
   believe, because it is again written, Blind the heart of this people.
   Such, too is the object which Christ has in view, when he ascribes it
   to the secret purpose of God, that the truth of the Gospel is not
   revealed indiscriminately to all, but is exhibited at a distance under
   obscure forms, so as to have no other effect than to overspread the
   minds of the people with grosser darkness. [186] In all cases, I admit,
   those whom God blinds will be found to deserve this condemnation; but
   as the immediate cause is not always obvious in the persons of men, let
   it be held as a fixed principle, that God enlightens to salvation, and
   that by a peculiar gift, those whom He has freely chosen; and that all
   the reprobate are deprived of the light of life, whether God withholds
   his word from them, or keeps their eyes and ears closed, that they do
   not hear or see.

   Hearing you shall hear. We now perceive the manner in which Christ
   applies the prediction of the prophet to the present occasion. He does
   not quote the prophet's words, nor was it necessary; for Christ
   reckoned it enough to show, that it was no new or uncommon occurrence,
   if many were hardened by the word of God. The words of the prophet
   were,

   Go, blind their minds, and harden their hearts, (Isaiah 6:10.)

   Matthew ascribes this to the hearers, that they may endure the blame of
   their own blindness and hardness; for the one cannot be separated from
   the other. All who have been given over to a reprobate mind (Romans
   1:28) do voluntarily, and from inward malice, blind and harden
   themselves. Nor can it be otherwise, wherever the Spirit of God does
   not reign, by whom the elect alone are governed. Let us, therefore,
   attend to this connection, that all whom God does not enlighten with
   the Spirit of adoption are men of unsound mind; and that, while they
   are more and more blinded by the word of God, the blame rests wholly on
   themselves, because this blindness is voluntary. Again, the ministers
   of the word ought to seek consolation from this passage, if the success
   of their labors does not always correspond to their wish. Many are so
   far from profiting by their instruction, that they are rendered worse
   by it. What has befallen them was experienced by a Prophet, [187] to
   whom they are not superior. It were, indeed, to be wished, that they
   should bring all under subjection to God; and they ought to labor and
   strive for that end. But let them not wonder if that judgment, which
   God anciently displayed through the ministration of the Prophet, is
   likewise fulfilled at the present day. At the same time, we ought to be
   extremely careful, that the fruit of the Gospel be not lost through our
   negligence.

   Mark 4:12. That seeing, they may see, and not perceive. Here it may
   suffice to state briefly what has already been fully explained, that
   the doctrine is not, strictly speaking, or by itself, or in its own
   nature, but by accident, the cause of blindness. When persons of a weak
   sight come out into sunshine, their eyes become dimmer than before, and
   that defect is in no way attributed to the sun, but to their eyes. In
   like manner, when the word of God blinds and hardens the reprobate, as
   this takes place through their own depravity, it belongs truly and
   naturally to themselves, but is accidental, as respects the word.

   Lest at any time they should be converted. This clause points out the
   advantage that is gained by seeing and understanding It is, that men,
   having been converted to God, are restored to his favor, and, being
   reconciled to him, enjoy prosperity and happiness. The true end for
   which

   God desires that his word should be preached is, to reconcile men to
   himself by renewing their minds and hearts. With respect to the
   reprobate, on the other hand, Isaiah here declares that the stony
   hardness remains in them, so that they do not obtain mercy, and that
   the word fails to produce its effect upon them, so as to soften their
   minds to repentance.

   Matthew 13:15. Lest I should heal them In the word healing, Matthew, as
   well as the Prophet, includes deliverance from every evil; for a people
   afflicted by the hand of God is metaphorically compared by them to a
   sick man. They say that healing is bestowed, [188] when the Lord
   releases from punishment. But as this healing depends on the pardon of
   sins, Mark describes appropriately and justly its cause and source,
   lest they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them
   For whence comes the mitigation of chastisements, but because God has
   been reconciled to us, and makes us the objects of his blessing?
   Sometimes, no doubt, after removing our guilt, he continues to punish
   us, either with the view of humbling us the more, or of making us more
   cautious for the future. And yet, not only does he show evidences of
   his favor by restoring us to life and health; but as punishments
   usually terminate when the guilt is removed, healing and forgiveness
   are properly introduced together. It must not, however, be concluded,
   that repentance is the cause of pardon, as if God received into his
   favor converted men, because they deserved it; [189] for conversion
   itself is a mark of God's free favor. Nothing more is expressed than
   such an order and connection, that God does not forgive the sins of any
   but those who are dissatisfied with themselves.

   Matthew 13:16. But blessed are your eyes. Luke appears to represent
   this statement as having been spoken at another time; but this is
   easily explained, for in that passage he throws together a variety of
   our Lord's sayings, without attending to the order of dates. We shall,
   therefore, follow the text of Matthew, who explains more clearly the
   circumstances from which Christ took occasion to utter these words.
   Having formerly reminded them of the extraordinary favor which they had
   received, in being separated by our Lord from the common people, and
   familiarly admitted to the mysteries of his kingdom, he now magnifies
   that grace by another comparison, which is, that they excel ancient
   Prophets and holy Kings This is a far loftier distinction than to be
   preferred to an unbelieving multitude. Christ does not mean any kind of
   hearing, or the mere beholding of the flesh, but pronounces their eyes
   to be blessed, because they perceive in him a glory which is worthy of
   the only-begotten Son of God, so as to acknowledge him as the Redeemer;
   because they perceive shining in him the lively image of God, by which
   they obtain salvation and perfect happiness; and because in them is
   fulfilled what had been spoken by the Prophets, that those who have
   been truly and perfectly taught by the Lord (Isaiah 54:13) do not need
   to learn every man from his neighbor, (Jeremiah 31:34.)

   This furnishes a reply to an objection that might be drawn from another
   saying of Christ, that

   blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed,
   (John 20:29;)

   for there he describes that kind of seeing which Thomas desired in
   consequence of his gross apprehension. [190] But that seeing, of which
   Christ now speaks, has been enjoyed by believers in every age in common
   with the Apostles. We do not see Christ, and yet we see him; we do not
   hear Christ, and yet we hear him: for in the Gospel we behold him, as
   Paul says,

   face to face, so as to be transformed into his image,
   (2 Corinthians 3:18;)

   and the perfection of wisdom, righteousness, and life, which was
   formerly exhibited in him, shines there continually.

   Luke 10:24. Many Prophets and Kings have desired to see. The condition
   of the Church, at the present day, is justly pronounced to be
   preferable to that of the holy fathers, who lived under the Law;
   because to them was exhibited, under shadows and figures only, what is
   now openly manifested in the shining face of Christ. The veil of the
   temple being rent, (Matthew 27:51,) we enter by faith into the heavenly
   sanctuary, and are freely permitted to approach to God. Although the
   fathers were satisfied with their lot, and enjoyed a blessed peace in
   their own minds, yet this did not prevent their desires from extending
   farther. Thus, Abraham saw the day of Christ afar off, and rejoice,
   (John 8:56,) and yet longed to enjoy a nearer view, but did not obtain
   his wish. Simeon spoke the sentiments of all, [191] when he said, Now
   thou sendest thy servant away in peace, (Luke 2:29.) And indeed it was
   impossible that, under the burden of that curse by which the human race
   is crushed, they should be otherwise than altogether inflamed with the
   desire of a promised deliverance. [192] Let us therefore learn, that
   they breathed after Christ, like hungry persons, and yet possessed a
   serene faith; so that they did not murmur against God, but kept their
   minds in patient expectation till the full time of revelation.

   Matthew 13:18-23

   Mark 4:13-20

   Luke 8:11-15

   18. Hear therefore the parable of the sower. 19. When any one heareth
   the word of the kingdom, and understandeth not, that wicked one cometh,
   and taketh away what was sown in the heart. This is he who received
   seed near the road. 20. But he that received the seed thrown into stony
   places, is he that heareth the word, and immediately receiveth it with
   joy: 21. But hath not root in himself, but is of short duration: when
   affliction or persecution ariseth on account of the word, immediately
   he is offended. 22. And he that received the seed among thorns is he
   that heareth the word, and the care of this life, and the deceitfulness
   of riches, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. 23. But he who
   receiveth seed into a good soil is he that heareth the word and
   understandeth it, and who afterwards yieldeth and produceth fruit,
   [193] some a hundred-fold, some sixty-fold, and some thirty-fold.


   13. And he said to them, Know you not this parable? and how shall you
   know all parables? 14. The sower is he that soweth the word. 15. And
   there are some that (receive the seed) near the road, in whom the word
   is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan cometh, and taketh
   away the word which was sown in their hearts. 16. And in like manner
   there are others who receive the seed into stony places, who, when they
   have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy; 17. And have not
   root in themselves, but are of short duration: afterwards, when
   affliction or persecution ariseth on account of the words, immediately
   they are offended. 18. And there are others who receive the seed among
   thorns: these are they that hear the word, 19. And the anxieties of
   this life, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires of other
   things, entering in, choke the word, and it is rendered unfruitful.
   20. There are others who have received the seed into a good soil, who
   hear the word, and receive it, and bear fruit, some thirty, some sixty,
   some a hundred.

   11. Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. 12. And they
   that (received the seed) near the road are those who hear: afterwards
   cometh the devil, and taketh the word out of their heart, that they may
   not believe and be saved. 13. For they that are on the rock are those
   who, when they have heard, receive the word with joy: but these have
   not roots, who for a time believe, and in the time of temptation fall
   away. 14. And what fell among thorns are those who have heard, and,
   going away, are choked by the anxieties, and riches, and pleasures of
   life, and do not yield fruit. 15. And what fell into a good soil are
   those who, with a good and upright heart, keep it, and yield fruit with
   patience.



   According to Matthew and Luke, Christ explains the parable to his
   disciples simply, and unaccompanied by a reproof; but according to
   Mark, he indirectly blames them for being slow of apprehension, because
   those who were to be the teachers of all did not run before others.
   [194] The general truth conveyed is, that the doctrine of the Gospel,
   when it is scattered like seed, [195] is not everywhere fruitful;
   because it does not always meet with a fertile and well cultivated
   soil. He enumerates four kinds of hearers: the first of which do not
   receive the seed; [196] the second appear, indeed, to receive it, [197]
   but in such a manner that it does not take deep root; in the third, the
   corn is choked; [198] and so there remains a fourth part, which
   produces fruit. Not that one hearer only out of four, or ten out of
   forty, embrace the doctrine, and yield fruit; for Christ did not intend
   here to fix down an exact number, or to arrange the persons, of whom he
   speaks, in equal divisions; and, indeed, where the word is sown, the
   produce of faith is not always alike, but is sometimes more abundant,
   and at other times more scanty. He only intended to warn us, that, in
   many persons, the seed of life is lost on account of various defects,
   in consequence of which it is either destroyed immediately, or it
   withers, or it gradually degenerates. That we may derive the greater
   advantage from this warning, we ought to bear in mind, that he makes no
   mention of despisers who openly reject the word of God, but describes
   those only in whom there is some appearance of docility. But if the
   greater part of such men perish, what shall become of the rest of the
   world, by whom the doctrine of salvation is openly rejected? I now come
   down to each class.

   Matthew 13:19. When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and
   understandeth it not. He mentions, in the first place, the barren and
   uncultivated, who do not receive the seed within, because there is no
   preparation in their hearts. Such persons he compares to a stiff and
   dry soil, like what we find on a public road, which is trodden down,
   and becomes hard, like a pavement. I wish that we had not occasion to
   see so many of this class at the present day, who come forward to hear,
   but remain in a state of amazement, and acquire no relish for the word,
   and in the end differ little from blocks or stones. Need we wonder that
   they utterly vanish away?

   That which was sown in their heart. This expression, which Christ
   employs, is not strictly accurate, and yet it is not without meaning;
   for the wickedness and depravity of men do not make the word to lose
   its own nature, or to cease to have the character of seed. This must be
   carefully observed, that we may not suppose the favors of God to cease
   to be what they are, though the good effect of them does not reach us.
   With respect to God, the word is sown in the hearts, but it is far from
   being true, that the hearts of all receive with meekness what is
   planted in them, as James (1:21) exhorts us to receive the word. So
   then the Gospel is always a fruitful seed as to its power, but not as
   to its produce. [199]

   Luke adds, that the devil [200] taketh away the seed out of their
   heart, that they may not believe and be saved Hence we infer that, as
   hungry birds are wont to do at the time of sowing, this enemy of our
   salvation, as soon as the doctrine is delivered, watches and rushes
   forth to seize it, before it acquires moisture and springs up. It is no
   ordinary praise of the word, when it is pronounced to be the cause of
   our salvation.

   20. But he that received the seed thrown into stony places. This class
   differs from the former; for temporary faith, being a sort of
   vegetation of the seed, [201] promises at first some fruit; but their
   hearts are not so properly and thoroughly subdued, as to have the
   softness necessary for their continued nourishment. [202] We see too
   many of this class in our own day, who eagerly embrace the Gospel, and
   shortly afterwards fall off; for they have not the lively affection
   that is necessary to give them firmness and perseverance. Let every one
   then examine himself thoroughly, that the alacrity which gives out a
   bright flame may not quickly go out, as the saying is, like a fire of
   tow; [203] for if the word does not fully penetrate the whole heart,
   and strike its roots deep, faith will want the supply of moisture that
   is necessary for perseverance. Great commendation is due, no doubt, to
   that promptitude, which receives the word of God with joy, and without
   delay, as soon as it is published; but let us learn, that nothing has
   been done, till faith acquires true firmness, that it may not wither in
   the first blade.

   21. When affliction or persecution ariseth on account of the word. By
   way of example, Christ says that such persons are made uneasy by the
   offense of the cross. And certainly, as the heat of the sun discovers
   the barrenness of the soil, so persecution and the cross lay open the
   vanity of those, who are slightly influenced by I know not what desire,
   but are not actually moved by earnest feelings of piety. Such persons,
   according to Matthew and Mark, are temporary, [204] not only because,
   having professed, for a time, that they are the disciples of Christ,
   they afterwards fall away through temptation, but because they imagine
   that they have true faith. According to Luke, Christ says that they
   believe for a time; because that honor which they render to the Gospel
   resembles faith. [205] At the same time we ought to learn, that they
   are not truly regenerated by the incorruptible seed, which never
   fadeth, as Peter tells us, (1 Peter 1:4;) for he says that these words
   of Isaiah, The word of God endureth for ever, (Isaiah 40:8; 1 Peter
   1:25,) are fulfilled in the hearts of believers, in whom the truth of
   God, once fixed, never passes away, but retains its vigor to the end.
   Still, those persons who take delight in the word of God, and cherish
   some reverence for it, do in some manner believe; for they are widely
   different from unbelievers, who give no credit to God when he speaks,
   or who reject his word. In a word, let us learn that none are partakers
   of true faith, except those who are scaled with the Spirit of adoption,
   and who sincerely call on God as their Father; and as that Spirit is
   never extinguished, so it is impossible that the faith, which he has
   once engraven on the hearts of the godly, shall pass away or be
   destroyed.

   22. And he who received the seed among thorns. He places in the third
   class, those who would have been disposed to receive the seed within,
   if they had not permitted other things to corrupt and render it
   degenerate. Christ compares to thorns the pleasures of this life, or
   wicked desires, and covetousness, and the other anxieties of the flesh.
   Matthew mentions only the care of this life, along with covetousness,
   but the meaning is the same; for under that term he includes the
   allurements of pleasures, which Luke mentions, and every kind of
   desire. As corn, which otherwise might have been productive, no sooner
   rises into the stalk than it is choked by thorns and other matters
   injurious to its growth; so the sinful affections of the flesh prevail
   over the hearts of men, and overcome faith, and thus destroy the force
   of the heavenly doctrine, before it has reached maturity.

   Now though sinful desires exert their power on the hearts of men,
   before the word of the Lord springs up into the blade, yet, at first,
   their influence is not perceived, and it is only when the corn has
   grown up, and given promise of fruit, that they gradually make their
   appearance. Each of us ought to endeavor to tear the thorns out of his
   heart, if we do not choose that the word of God should be choked; for
   there is not one of us whose heart is not filled with a vast quantity,
   and, as I may say, a thick forest, of thorns. And, indeed, we perceive
   how few there are that reach maturity; for there is scarcely one
   individual out of ten that labors, I do not say to root out, but even
   to cut down the thorns. Nay more, the very number of the thorns, which
   is so prodigious that it ought to shake off our sloth, is the reason
   why most people give themselves no trouble about them.

   The deceitfulness of riches. Christ employs this phrase to denote
   covetousness He expressly says, that riches are imposing or deceitful,
   in order that men may be more desirous to guard against falling into
   their snares. Let us remember that the affections of our flesh, the
   number and variety of which are incalculable, are so many injurious
   influences to corrupt the seed of life.

   23. But he that received the seed into a good soil. None are compared
   by Christ to a good and fertile soil, but those in whom the word of God
   not only strikes its roots deep and solid, but overcomes every obstacle
   that would prevent it from yielding fruit. Is it objected that it is
   impossible to find any one who is pure and free from thorns? It is easy
   to reply, that Christ does not now speak of the perfection of faith,
   but only points out those in whom the word of God yields fruit. Though
   the produce may not be great, yet every one who does not fall off from
   the sincere worship of God is reckoned a good and fertile soil We ought
   to labor, no doubt, to pull out the thorns; but as our utmost exertion
   will never succeed so well, but that there will always be some
   remaining behind, let each of us endeavor, at least, to deaden them,
   that they may not hinder the fruit of the word. This statement is
   confirmed by what immediately follows, when Christ informs us that all
   do not yield fruit in an equal degree.

   Some a hundred-fold, and some sixty-fold, and some thirty-fold. Though
   the fertility of that soil, which yields a thirty-fold produce, is
   small, compared with that which yields a hundred-fold, yet we perceive
   that our Lord classes together all kinds of soil which do not entirely
   disappoint the labors and expectation of the husbandman. [206] Hence
   too we learn, that we have no right to despise those who occupy a lower
   degree of excellence; for the master of the house himself, though he
   gives to one the preference above another on account of more abundant
   produce, yet bestows the general designation, good, even on inferior
   soils. Those three gradations are absurdly tortured by Jerome, to
   denote virgins, widows, and married persons; as if that produce which
   the Lord demands from us belonged to celibacy alone, and as if the
   piety of married persons did not, in many cases, yield more abundantly
   every fruit of virtue. It must also be observed, in passing, that what
   Christ says about a hundred-fold produce is not hyperbolical; for such
   was at that time the fertility of some countries, as we learn from many
   historians, who give their report as eye-witnesses.

   Matthew 13:24-30, 36-43

   Matthew 13:24-30, 36-43

   24. He put forth to them another parable, saying, The kingdom of heaven
   is compared to a man sowing good seed in his field. 25. But while men
   were asleep, his enemy came, and sowed tares among the wheat, and went
   away. 26. And when the blade sprang up, and yielded fruit, then
   appeared also the tares. 27. And the servants of the household
   approaching, said to him, Lord, didst not thou sow good seed in thy
   field? Whence then hath it tares? [207] 28. And he said to them, An
   enemy [208] hath done this. And his servants said to him, Is it thy
   will then that we go away and gather them? 29. But he said, No; lest,
   while you are gathering the tares, you root out along with them the
   wheat also. 30. Allow both to grow together till the harvest; and at
   the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather first the tares,
   and bind them in bundles to burn them; but collect the wheat into my
   barn. -- (A little after.) 36. Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and
   came into the house, and his disciples approached him, saying, Explain
   to us the parable of the tares of the field. 37. But he answering, said
   to them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man. 38. And the
   field is the world. The good seed is the children of the kingdom; but
   the tares are the children of that wicked one. 39. And the enemy that
   soweth them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world, and the
   reapers are the angels. 40. So then as the tares are gathered, and are
   burned in the fire, so shall it be at the end of this world. 41. The
   Son of man will send his angels, and will gather out of his kingdom all
   stumbling-blocks, and those who commit iniquity. 42. And they will east
   them into a furnace of fire: there shall be lamentation and gnashing of
   teeth. 43. Then the righteous will shine as the sun in the kingdom of
   their Father. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.


   In order to reap the advantage of this parable, it is necessary to
   ascertain the object which Christ had in view. Some think that, to
   guard a mixed multitude against satisfying themselves with an outward
   profession of the Gospel, [209] he told them, that in his own field bad
   seed is often mixed with the good, but that a day is coming, when the
   tares shall be separated from the wheat. [210] They accordingly connect
   this parable with the one immediately preceding, as if the design of
   both had been the same. For my own part, I take a different view. He
   speaks of a separation, in order to prevent the minds of the godly from
   giving way to uneasiness or despondency, when they perceive a confused
   mixture of the good along with the bad. Although Christ has cleansed
   the Church with his own blood, that it may be without spot or blemish,
   yet hitherto he suffers it to be polluted by many stains. I speak not
   of the remaining infirmities of the flesh, to which every believer is
   liable, even after that he has been renewed by the Holy Spirit. But as
   soon as Christ has gathered a small flock for himself, many hypocrites
   mingle with it, persons of immoral lives creep in, nay, many wicked men
   insinuate themselves; in consequence of which, numerous stains pollute
   that holy assembly, which Christ has separated for himself. Many
   persons, too, look upon it as exceedingly absurd, that ungodly, or
   profane or unprincipled men should be cherished within the bosom of the
   Church. Add to this, that very many, under the pretense of zeal, are
   excessively displeased, when every thing is not conducted to their
   wish, and, because absolute purity is nowhere to be found, withdraw
   from the Church in a disorderly manner, or subvert and destroy it by
   unreasonable severity.

   In my opinion, the design of the parable is simply this: So long as the
   pilgrimage of the Church in this world continues, bad men and
   hypocrites will mingle in it with those who are good and upright, that
   the children of God may be armed with patience and, in the midst of
   offenses which are fitted to disturb them, may preserve unbroken
   stedfastness of faith. It is an appropriate comparison, when the Lord
   calls the Church his field, for believers are the seed of it; and
   though Christ afterwards adds that the field is the world, yet he
   undoubtedly intended to apply this designation, in a peculiar manner,
   to the Church, about which he had commenced the discourse. But as he
   was about to drive his plough through every country of the world, so as
   to cultivate fields, and scatter the seed of life, throughout the whole
   world, he has employed a synecdoche, to make the world denote what more
   strictly belonged only to a part of it.

   We must now inquire what he means by the wheat, and what by the tares
   These terms cannot be explained as referring to doctrine, as if the
   meaning had been that, when the Gospel is sown, it is immediately
   corrupted and adulterated by wicked inventions; for Christ would never
   have forbidden them to labor strenuously to purge out that kind of
   corruption. With respect to morals, those faults of men which cannot be
   corrected must be endured; but we are not at liberty to extend such a
   toleration to wicked errors, which corrupt the purity of faith. [211]
   Besides, Christ removes all doubt, by saying expressly, that the tares
   are the children of the wicked one And yet it must also be remarked,
   that this cannot be understood simply of the persons of men, as if by
   creation God sowed good men and the devil sowed bad men. I advert to
   this, because the present passage has been abused by the Manicheans,
   for the purpose of lending support to their notion of two principles.
   But we know that whatever sin exists, either in the devil or in men, is
   nothing else than the corruption of the whole nature. As it is not by
   creation that God makes his elect, who have been tainted with original
   sin, to become a good seed, but by regenerating them through the grace
   of his Spirit; so wicked men are not created by the devil, but, having
   been created by God, are corrupted by the devil, and thrown into the
   Lord's field, in order to corrupt the pure seed.

   37. He that soweth the good seed He had formerly said that the kingdom
   of heaven resembles a man sowing. The mode of expression is unusual,
   but plainly means, that the same thing happens with the preaching of
   the Gospel as usually takes place in the sowing of fields; the tares
   grow, up along with the wheat One peculiarity, however, is pointed out
   by him, when he says that the sowing of tares in the field was effected
   by the trick of an enemy. This is intended to inform us that, when many
   wicked men are mingled with believers, this is no accidental or natural
   occurrence, as if they were the same seed, but that we must learn to
   charge the blame of this evil on the devil. Not that, by condemning
   him, men are acquitted of guilt; but, in the first place, that no blame
   whatever may be laid on God on account of this fault which arose from
   the agency of another; and, secondly, that we may not be surprised to
   find tares frequently growing in the Lord's field, since Satan is
   always on the watch to do mischief. Again, when Christ says, not that
   the ministers of the word sow, but that he alone sows, this is not
   without meaning; for though this cannot be supposed to be restricted to
   his person, yet as he makes use of our exertions, and employs us as his
   instruments, for cultivating his field, so that He alone acts by us and
   in us, he justly claims for himself what is, in some respects, common
   to his ministers. Let us, therefore, remember, that the Gospel is
   preached, not only by Christ's command, but by his authority. and
   direction; in short, that we are only his hand, and that He alone is
   the Author of the work.

   39. The harvest is the end of the world. This is, no doubt, a very
   distressing consideration, that the Church is burdened with the
   reprobate to the very end of the world; but Christ enjoins on us to
   exercise patience till that time, that we may not deceive ourselves
   with a vain hope. Pastors ought to labor strenuously to purify the
   Church; and all the godly, so far as their respective callings enable
   them, ought to lend assistance in this matter; but when all shall have
   devoted their united exertions to the general advantage, they will not
   succeed in such a manner as to purify the Church entirely from every
   defilement. Let us therefore hold, that nothing was farther from the
   design of Christ than to encourage pollution by lending countenance to
   it. All that he intended was, to exhort those who believed in him not
   to lose courage, because they are under the necessity of retaining
   wicked men among them; and, next, to restrain and moderate the zeal of
   those who fancy that they are not at liberty to join in a society with
   any but pure angels. [212]

   This passage has been most improperly abused by the Anabaptists, and by
   others like them, [213] to take from the Church the power of the sword.
   But it is easy to refute them; for since they approve of
   excommunication, which cuts off, at least for a time, the bad and
   reprobate, why may not godly magistrates, when necessity calls for it,
   use the sword against wicked men? They reply that, when the punishment
   is not capital, [214] there is room allowed for repentance; as if the
   thief on the cross (Luke 23:42) did not find the means of salvation. I
   shall satisfy myself with replying, that Christ does not now speak of
   the office of pastors or of magistrates, but removes the offense which
   is apt to disturb weak minds, when they perceive that the Church is
   composed not only of the elect, but of the polluted dregs of society.

   The reapers are the angels. This term must be viewed in reference to
   the present subject. In another passage, the Apostles are called
   reapers, as compared with the Prophets, because they have entered into
   their labors, (John 4:38,) and it is enjoined on all the ministers of
   the word,

   that they should bring forth fruit, and that their fruit should remain,
   (John 15:16.)

   Such also is the import of that statement, that the fields are white,
   and are in want of reapers, (John 4:35;) and again, that

   the harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few,
   (Matthew 9:37.)

   But here the comparison is applied in a different manner; for those who
   occupy a place in the Church are said to be planted in the Lord's
   field. Nor is this inconsistent with what is said elsewhere, that
   Christ, as soon as he comes forth with his Gospel,

   hath a winnowing-fan in his hand, and will thoroughly
   cleanse his thrashing-floor, (Matthew 3:12.)

   These words describe the commencement of that cleansing, which, this
   passage declares, will not take place before the last day, because not
   till then will it be fully completed. Christ will put the last hand to
   the cleansing of the Church by means of angels, but he now begins to do
   the work by means of pious teachers. He assigns this office to angels,
   because they will not remain idle spectators before his tribunal, [215]
   but will hold themselves in readiness to execute his commands. It
   follows, that those who proceed, with undue haste, to root out whatever
   displeases them, prevent, as far as lies in their power, the sentence
   of Christ, deprive angels of their office, and rashly take that office
   on themselves.

   41. They shall gather out of his kingdom all stumbling-blocks The words
   that follow, and those who commit iniquity, are added for the sake of
   exposition; for it is not intended to point out two different things,
   but to state, that then will be the full and seasonable time, when all
   things shall be restored to regular order, and when the wicked shall be
   removed, who are now stumbling-blocks. They are so called, because not
   only are their own lives wicked, but they undermine the faith of many,
   retard others in the right course, draw some entirely aside, and drive
   others headlong. We ought to draw from this a useful admonition, not to
   become indolent and careless on account of our being surrounded by so
   many stumbling-blocks, but to be zealous and active in guarding against
   them. It reproves also the effeminacy of those who are so delicate,
   that the smallest possible stumbling-blocks make them turn back. [216]
   It is difficult, I admit, not to stumble frequently, and even sometimes
   to fall, when stumbling-blocks without number lie across our path. But
   our minds ought to be fortified with confidence; for the Son of God,
   who commands his followers to walk in the midst of stumbling-blocks,
   will unquestionably give us strength to overcome them all. He
   pronounces likewise an awful punishment against any hypocrites and
   reprobate persons, who now appear to be the most distinguished citizens
   of the Church.

   42. And shall cast them into a furnace of fire. This is a metaphorical
   expression; for, as the infinite glory which is laid up for the sons of
   God so far exceeds all our senses, that we cannot find words to express
   it, so the punishment which awaits the reprobate is incomprehensible,
   and is therefore shadowed out according to the measure of our capacity.
   From ignorance of this, the Sophists have tortured themselves, to no
   purpose, by fruitless disputes, as we have already hinted on a former
   occasion. [217] Some commentators, I am aware, carry their ingenious
   inquiries into every minute phrase; but as there is reason to fear that
   subtleties, which rest on no solid grounds, may lead us into idle
   fooleries, I choose to philosophize more sparingly, and to rest
   satisfied with the plain and natural meaning. If we put a question to
   those who are so delighted with matters of curiosity, how it comes
   about that, while Christ is asleep, and unacquainted with the affair,
   the devil sows tares among the good seed, they will have nothing to
   reply; but while I desire to exercise caution, I have endeavored to
   leave out nothing that is useful and necessary to be known.

   43. Then will the righteous shine. What a remarkable consolation! The
   sons of God, who now lie covered with dust, or are held in no
   estimation, or even are loaded with reproaches, will then shine in full
   brightness, as when the sky is serene, and every cloud has been
   dispelled. The adverb then (tote) is emphatic; for it contains an
   implied contrast between their present state and the ultimate
   restoration, by the expectation of which Christ animates those who
   believe in him. The meaning therefore is, Though many wicked men now
   hold a high rank in the Church, yet that blessed day is assuredly to be
   expected, when the Son of God shall raise his followers on high, and
   remove every thing that now tends to dim or conceal their brightness.
   It is no doubt true, that the future glory is promised to none but
   those in whom the image of God already shines, and who are transformed
   into it by continued advances of glory. But as the life of the godly is
   now hidden, and as their salvation is invisible, because it consists in
   hope, Christ properly directs the attention of believers to heaven,
   where they will find the glory that is promised to them.

   In order to make a deeper impression on his hearers, our Lord
   unquestionably refers here to a passage in Daniel, (12:3,)

   And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament.

   "The Prophet," he seems to say, "when he predicts a future brightness,
   intimates also that there is a temporary obscurity: and so, if we admit
   the prediction, we ought to endure patiently that mixture which, for a
   time, classes the elect of God with the reprobate." By comparing this
   glory to the sun, he does not determine that it will be alike in all.
   As Christ now distributes his gifts variously [218] among believers, in
   like manner will he crown these gifts at the last day. But we must
   recollect what I have said, that the restoration, which is delayed till
   the last coming of Christ, is compared with the cloudy state of the
   world. [219]

   The kingdom of the Father, as the inheritance of the godly, is
   contrasted with the earth, to remind them that here they are pilgrims,
   and therefore ought to look upwards towards heaven. In another passage,
   the kingdom of God is said to be within us, (Luke 17:21,) but we shall
   not obtain the full enjoyment of it till God be all in all, (1
   Corinthians 15:28.)

   Matthew 13:31-35; Mark 4:26-34;
   Luke 13:18-22

   Matthew 13:31-35

   Mark 4:26-34

   Luke 13:18-22

   31. He delivered another parable to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven
   is like a grain of mustard, which a man took and sowed in his field:
   32. Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown up, it
   is the largest among herbs, [220] and becometh a tree, so that the
   fowls of heaven come and make their nests among its branches. 33. He
   spake another parable to them: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven,
   which a woman took and hid among three measures of meal, till the whole
   was leavenened. 34. All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the
   multitudes, and without a parable he spoke nothing to them. 35. That it
   might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, who saith, I will
   open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been hidden
   from the foundation of the world.


   26. And he said, The kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed
   into the ground, 27. And sleep, and rise by night and day, and the corn
   should spring and grow up, while knoweth not how. 28. For the earth
   yieldeth fruit of itself, first the blade, then the ear, and then the
   full corn in the ear. 29. And when the fruit is matured, he immediately
   applieth the sickle, because the harvest is at hand. 30. And he said,
   To what shall we say that the kingdom of God is like? or with what
   comparison shall we compare it? 31. As a grain of mustard, which, when
   it is sown in the earth, is smaller than all the seeds which are in the
   earth; 32. And when it is sown, it springs up, and is larger than all
   herbs, [221] and putteth forth great branches, so that the fowls of
   heaven can make their nests under its shadow. 33. And by such parables
   he spake the word to them, as they were able to bear it: 34. But
   without a parable he did not speak to them, but he explained all things
   to his disciples when they were apart.

   18. Therefore he said, To what is the kingdom of God like? and to what
   shall I compare it? 19. It is like a grain of mustard, which a man took
   and cast into his garden, and it grew, and became a large tree, and the
   fowls of the air made their nests among its branches. 20. And again he
   said, To what shall I compare the kingdom of God? 21. It is like
   leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the
   whole was leavened. 22. And he went through the cities and villages,
   teaching and journeying towards Jerusalem.



   By these parables Christ encourages his disciples not to be offended
   and turn back on account of the mean beginnings of the Gospel. We see
   how haughtily profane men despise the Gospel, and even turn it into
   ridicule, because the ministers by whom it is preached are men of
   slender reputation and of low rank; because it is not instantly
   received with applause by the whole world; and because the few
   disciples whom it does obtain are, for the most part, men of no weight
   or consideration, and belong to the common people. This leads weak
   minds to despair of its success, which they are apt to estimate from
   the manner of its commencement. On the contrary, the Lord opens his
   reign with a feeble and despicable commencement, for the express
   purpose, that his power may be more fully illustrated by its unexpected
   progress. [222]

   The kingdom of God is compared to a grain of mustard, which is the
   smallest among the seeds, but grows to such a height that it becomes a
   shrub, in which the birds build their nests. It is likewise compared to
   leaven, which, though it may be small in amount, spreads its influence
   in such a manner, as to impart its bitterness to a large quantity of
   meal. [223] If the aspect of Christ's kingdom be despicable in the eyes
   of the flesh, let us learn to raise our minds to the boundless and
   incalculable power of God, which at once created all things out of
   nothing, and every day raises up things that are not, (1 Corinthians
   1:28,) in a manner which exceeds the capacity of the human senses. Let
   us leave to proud men their disdainful laugh, till the Lord, at an
   unexpected hour, shall strike them with amazement. Meanwhile, let us
   not despond, but rise by faith against the pride of the world, till the
   Lord give us that astonishing display of his power, [224] of which he
   speaks in this passage.

   The word leaven is sometimes taken in a bad sense, as when Christ warns
   them to

   beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees,
   (Matthew 16:11;)

   and when Paul says, that

   a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump,
   (1 Corinthians 5:6.)

   But here the term must be understood simply as applying to the present
   subject. As to the meaning of the phrase, the kingdom of God, and the
   kingdom of heaven, we have spoken on former occasions.

   Mark 4:26. So is the kingdom of God. Though this comparison has the
   same object with the two immediately preceding, yet Christ appears to
   direct his discourse purposely to the ministers of the word, that they
   may not grow indifferent about the discharge of their duty, because the
   fruit of their labor does not immediately appear. He holds out for
   their imitation the example of husbandmen, who throw seed into the
   ground with the expectation of reaping, and do not torment themselves
   with uneasiness and anxiety, but go to bed and rise again; or, in other
   words, pursue their ordinary and daily toil, till the corn arrive at
   maturity in due season. In like manner, though the seed of the word be
   concealed and choked for a time, Christ enjoins pious teachers to be of
   good courage, and not to allow their alacrity to be slackened through
   distrust.

   Matthew 13:34. All these things Jesus spoke in parables. Though Mark
   expressly says, that Christ spoke the word to them as they were able to
   bear it, yet I think it probable that he continued to employ parables,
   not so much for the purpose of instruction, as to keep the attention of
   his hearers awake till a more convenient time. For why did he explain
   them familiarly to his disciples when they were apart? Was it because
   they were more slow of apprehension than the great body of the people?
   No; but because he wished to convey to them privately a knowledge of
   his meaning, and to allow others to remain in a state of suspense, till
   a fitter opportunity should arrive. These were only a sort of
   introduction to the Gospel, the full brightness and publication of
   which was delayed till the proper time.

   There is an apparent contradiction between this statement of Matthew
   and the prediction of Isaiah, which was quoted a little before. But
   this is easily removed; for, though he withdrew the light of doctrine
   from the reprobate, yet this did not prevent him from accommodating
   himself to their capacity, so as to render them inexcusable. He
   therefore adopted a method of teaching which was proper and suitable to
   hearers, whom he knew to be not yet sufficiently prepared to receive
   instruction.

   35. That it might be fulfilled Matthew does not mean, that the psalm,
   which he quotes, is a prediction which relates peculiarly to Christ,
   but that, as the majesty of the Spirit was displayed in the discourse
   of the Prophet, in the same manner was his power manifested in the
   discourse of Christ. The Prophet, when he is about to speak of God's
   covenant, by which he adopted the seed of Abraham, of the benefits
   which he continued to bestow upon his people, and of the whole
   government of the Church, introduces his subject in lofty terms, I will
   open my mouth in parables, (Psalm 78:2:) that is, "I will not speak of
   trifling matters, but will handle with becoming gravity subjects of the
   highest importance." When he adds, I will utter dark sayings, the
   meaning is the same; such repetitions being very frequent in the
   Psalms. The Hebrew word mslym, (Meshalim) signifies comparisons; and it
   came afterwards to be applied to "weighty sentences," because
   comparisons generally impart beauty and energy to a discourse. The word
   chydvt (Chidoth) sometimes denotes "riddles," and at other times,
   "short sayings."

   Now though Matthew seems to allude to the word parable, he undoubtedly
   means, that Christ spoke figuratively, in order that his very style,
   being more brilliant than ordinary discourse, might carry more weight
   and dignity. In short, he says that what is contained in the psalm was
   fulfilled; because the use of allegories and figures tended to show,
   that Christ was treating of the hidden mysteries of God, and to prevent
   his doctrine from being despised. Hence, too, we infer, that there was
   no inconsistency in the various objects which Christ had in view, when
   he spoke to the people in a dark manner. Though he intended to conceal
   from the reprobate what he was saying, yet he labored to make them
   feel, even in the midst of their amazement, that there was something
   heavenly and divine in his language. [225]

   Luke 13:22. Journeying towards Jerusalem. It is uncertain whether Luke
   speaks only of one journey, or means that, while Christ walked
   throughout Judea, and visited each part of it for the purpose of
   teaching, he was wont to go up to Jerusalem at the festivals. The
   former clause, certainly, appears to describe that course of life which
   Christ invariably pursued, from the time that he began to discharge the
   office which had been committed to him by the Father. To make the
   latter clause agree with this, the meaning will be, that, when the
   festivals were at hand, he attended, along with others, [226] the holy
   assemblies.

   Matthew 13:44-52

   Matthew 13:44-52

   44. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hid in a field,
   which when found a man hideth, [227] and for the joy which he hath on
   account of it, goeth away, and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth
   that field. 45. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant,
   seeking beautiful pearls, [228] 46. Who, having found one valuable
   pearl, went away, and sold all that he possessed, and bought it.
   47. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net east into the sea, and
   collecting of every kind, [229] 48. Which, when it was full, they drew
   to shore, and sat down, and collected the good into vessels, but cast
   away the bad. [230] 49. So shall it be at the end of the world: the
   Angels will come, and will separate the bad from the midst of the
   righteous, 50. And will cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall
   be lamentation and gnashing of teeth. 51. Jesus saith to them, Have you
   understood all these things? They say to him, Yes, Lord. 52. But he
   said to them, Therefore every scribe instructed in reference to the
   kingdom of heaven [231] is like a householder, who bringeth forth out
   of his treasure things new and old.


   The first two of these parables are intended to instruct believers to
   prefer the Kingdom of heaven to the whole world, and therefore to deny
   themselves and all the desires of the flesh, that nothing may prevent
   them from obtaining so valuable a possession. We are greatly in need of
   such a warning; for we are so captivated by the allurements of the
   world, that eternal life fades from our view; [232] and in consequence
   of our carnality, the spiritual graces of God are far from being held
   by us in the estimation which they deserve. Justly, therefore, does
   Christ speak in such lofty terms of the excellence of eternal life,
   that we ought not to feel uneasiness at relinquishing, on account of
   it, whatever we reckon in other respects to be valuable.

   First, he says, that the kingdom of heaven is like a hidden treasure.
   We commonly set a high value on what is visible, and therefore the new
   and spiritual life, which is held out to us in the Gospel, is little
   esteemed by us, because it is hidden, and lies in hope. There is the
   highest appropriateness in comparing it to a treasure, the value of
   which is in no degree diminished, though it may be buried in the earth,
   and withdrawn from the eyes of men. These words teach us, that we ought
   not to estimate the riches of the grace of God according to the views
   of our flesh, or according to their outward display, but in the same
   manner as a treasure, though it be hidden, is preferred to a vain
   appearance of wealth. The same instruction is conveyed by the other
   parable. One pearl, though it be small, is so highly valued, that a
   skillful merchant does not hesitate to sell houses and lands in order
   to purchase it. The excellence of the heavenly life is not perceived,
   indeed, by the sense of the flesh; and yet we do not esteem it
   according to its real worth, unless we are prepared to deny, on account
   of it, all that glitters in our eyes.

   We now perceive the leading object of both parables. It is to inform
   us, that none are qualified for receiving the grace of the Gospel but
   those who disregard all other desires, and devote all their exertions,
   and all their faculties, to obtain it. It deserves our attention, also,
   that Christ does not pronounce the hidden treasure, or the pearl, to be
   so highly valued by all. The treasure is ascertained to be valuable,
   after that it has been found and known; and it is the skillful merchant
   that forms such an opinion about the pearl [233] These words denote the
   knowledge of faith. "The heavenly kingdom," Christ tells us, "is
   commonly held as of no account, because men are incapable of relishing
   it, and do not perceive the inestimable value of that treasure which
   the Lord offers to us in the Gospel."

   But it is asked, is it necessary that we abandon every other
   possession, in order that we may enjoy eternal life? I answer briefly.
   The natural meaning of the words is, that the Gospel does not receive
   from us the respect which it deserves, unless we prefer it to all the
   riches, pleasures, honors, and advantages of the world, and to such an
   extent, that we are satisfied with the spiritual blessings which it
   promises, and throw aside every thing that would keep us from enjoying
   them; for those who aspire to heaven must be disengaged from every
   thing that would retard their progress. Christ exhorts those who
   believe in him to deny those things only which are injurious to
   godliness; and, at the same time, permits them to use and enjoy God's
   temporal favors, as if they did not use them.

   46. And bought it. By the word buy Christ does not mean, that men bring
   any price, with which they may purchase for themselves the heavenly
   life; for we know on what condition the Lord invites believers in the
   book of Isaiah, (55:1,) Come and buy wine and milk without money and
   without price. But though the heavenly life, and every thing that
   belongs to it, is the free gift of God, yet we are said to buy it, when
   we cheerfully relinquish the desires of the flesh, that nothing may
   prevent us from obtaining it; as Paul says, that he

   reckoned all things to be loss and dung, that he might gain Christ,
   (Philippians 3:8.)

   47. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net. No new instruction is
   here given by Christ; but what he formerly taught is confirmed by
   another parable, that the Church of God, so long as it exists in the
   world, is a mixture of the good with the bad, and is never free from
   stains and pollutions. And yet the design of this parable is perhaps
   different. It may be that Christ intends not only to remove the offense
   which perplexes many weak minds, because they do not find in the world
   all the purity that might be desired, but likewise to employ the
   influence of fear and modesty, in restraining his disciples from
   delighting themselves with the empty title, or mere profession, of
   faith. For my own part, I cheerfully adopt both views. Christ informs
   us, that a mixture of the good and the bad must be patiently endured
   till the end of the word; because, till that time, a true and perfect
   restoration of the Church will not take place. Again, he warns us, that
   it is not enough, and--what is more--that it is of little consequence
   to us, to be gathered into the fold, unless we are his true and chosen
   sheep. To this effect is the saying of Paul,

   The Lord knoweth who are his; and let every one that calleth on the
   name of the Lord depart from iniquity,
   (2 Timothy 2:19.)

   The preaching of the Gospel is justly compared to a net sunk beneath
   the water, to inform us that the present state of the Church is
   confused.

   Our God is the God of order, and not of confusion,
   (1 Corinthians 14:33,)

   and, therefore, recommends to us discipline; but he permits hypocrites
   to remain for a time among believers, till the last day, when he will
   bring his kingdom to a state of perfection. So far as lies in our
   power, let us endeavor to correct vices, and let us exercise severity
   in removing pollutions; but the Church will not be free from every spot
   and blemish, until Christ shall have separated the sheep from the
   goats, (Matthew 25:32.)

   51. Have you understood all these things? We must keep in recollection
   what we have formerly seen, that all the parables of Christ were
   explained in private. And now the Lord, after having taught them in
   this kind and familiar manner, warns them at the same time, that his
   object, in taking so much pains to instruct them, was not merely that
   they might be well informed, [234] but that they might communicate to
   others what they had received. In this way he whets and excites their
   minds more and more to desire instruction. He says that teachers are
   like householders, who are not only careful about their own food, but
   have a store laid up for the nourishment of others; and who do not live
   at ease as to the passing day, but make provision for a future and
   distant period. The meaning, therefore, is, that the teachers of the
   Church ought to be prepared by long study for giving to the people, as
   out of a storehouse, [235] a variety of instruction concerning the word
   of God, as the necessity of the case may require. Many of the ancient
   expositors understand by things new and old the Law and the Gospel; but
   this appears to me to be forced. I understand them simply to mean a
   varied and manifold distribution, wisely and properly adapted to the
   capacity of every individual.

   LUKE 7:36-50

   Luke 7:36-50

   36. And one of the Pharisees requested him to take food with him; and
   he entered into the house of the Pharisee, and sat down at table.
   37. And, lo, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, when she knew that
   he sat at table in the house of the Pharisee, brought an alabaster box
   of ointment: [236] 38. And sitting at his feet behind him, and weeping,
   she began to wash his feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of
   her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with ointment. [237]
   39. And the Pharisee, who had invited him, seeing it, said, speaking
   within himself, If this man were a Prophet, he would certainly know who
   and what sort of woman this is that toucheth him; for she is a sinner.
   [238] 40. And Jesus answering, said to him, Simon, I have something to
   say to thee. And he said, Master, say on. 41. A certain creditor had
   two debtors: one owed five hundred pence, and another fifty. 42. And
   when they had nothing to pay, he forgave them both. Tell me then, which
   of them will love him more? 43. Simon answering said, I suppose that it
   will be he to whom he forgave more. And he said to him, Thou hast
   decided aright. 44. And turning to the woman, he said to Simon, Seest
   thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest not water for my
   feet; but she hath moistened my feet with tears, and wiped them with
   the hairs of her head. 45. Thou gavest me not a kiss; but she, since
   the time that I entered, hath not ceased to kiss my feet. 47. For which
   reason I say to thee, Her many sins are forgiven, for she hath loved
   much; but he to whom less is forgiven loveth less. 48. And he said to
   her, Thy sins are forgiven thee. 49. And those who sat at table with
   him began to say within themselves, Who is this that even forgiveth
   sins? 50. And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in
   peace.



   36. And one of the Pharisees requested him. This narrative shows the
   captious disposition, not only to take, but to seek out, offenses,
   which was manifested by those who did not know the office of Christ. A
   Pharisee invites Christ; from which we infer, that he was not one of
   those who furiously and violently opposed, nor of those who haughtily
   despised his doctrine. But whatever might be his mildness, he is
   presently offended when he sees Christ bestow a gracious reception on a
   woman who, in his opinion, ought not to have been permitted to approach
   or to converse with him; and, accordingly, disowns him as a prophet,
   because he does not acknowledge him to be the Mediator, whose peculiar
   office it was to bring miserable sinners into a state of reconciliation
   with God. It was something, no doubt, to bestow on Christ the honor due
   to a prophet; but he ought also to have inquired for what purpose he
   was sent, what he brought, and what commission he had received from the
   Father. Overlooking the grace of reconciliation, which was the main
   feature to be looked for in Christ, the Pharisee concluded that he was
   not a prophet And, certainly, had it not been that through the grace of
   Christ this woman had obtained the forgiveness of her sins, and a new
   righteousness, she ought to have been rejected.

   Simon's mistake lies only in this: Not considering that Christ came to
   save what was lost, he rashly concludes that Christ does not
   distinguish between the worthy and the unworthy. That we may not share
   in this dislike, let us learn, first, that Christ was given as a
   Deliverer to miserable and lost men, [239] and to restore them from
   death to life. Secondly, let every man examine himself and his life,
   and then we will not wonder that others are admitted along with us, for
   no one will dare to place himself above others. It is hypocrisy alone
   that leads men to be careless about themselves, [240] and haughtily to
   despise others.

   37. A woman who was a sinner The words stand literally as I have
   translated them,(hetis hen hamaztolos.) Erasmus has chosen to take the
   pluperfect tense, who Had Been a sinner, [241] lest any one should
   suppose that at that time she still was a sinner But by so doing, he
   departed from the natural meaning; for Luke intended to express the
   place which the woman held in society, and the opinion universally
   entertained respecting her. Though her sudden conversion had rendered
   her a different person in the sight of God from what she had previously
   been, yet among men the disgrace attaching to her former life had not
   yet been effaced. She was, therefore, in the general estimation of men
   a sinner, that is, a woman of wicked and infamous life; and this led
   Simon to conclude, though erroneously, that Christ had not the Spirit
   of discernment, since he was unacquainted with that infamy which was
   generally known. [242]

   40. And Jesus answering said. By this reply Christ shows how
   egregiously Simon was mistaken. Exposing to public view his silent and
   concealed thought, he proves himself to possess something more
   excellent than what belonged to the Prophets; for he does not reply to
   his words, but refutes the sentiment which he kept hidden within his
   breast. Nor was it only on Simon's account that this was done, but in
   order to assure every one of us, that we have no reason to fear lest
   any sinner be rejected by him, who not only gives them kind and
   friendly invitations, but is prepared with equal liberality, and--as we
   might say--with outstretched arms, to receive them all.

   41. A certain creditor had two debtors The scope of this parable is to
   demonstrate, that Simon is wrong in condemning the woman who is
   acquitted by the heavenly judge. He proves that she is righteous, not
   because she pleased God, but because her sins were forgiven; for
   otherwise her case would not correspond to the parable, in which Christ
   expressly states, that the creditor freely forgave the debtors who were
   not able to pay. We cannot avoid wondering, therefore, that the greater
   part of commentators have fallen into so gross a blunder as to imagine
   that this woman, by her tears, and her anointing, and her kissing his
   feet, deserved the pardon of her sins. The argument which Christ
   employs was taken, not from the cause, but from the effect; for, until
   a favor has been received, it cannot awaken gratitude, [243] and the
   cause of reciprocal love is here declared to be a free forgiveness. In
   a word, Christ argues from the fruits or effects that follow it, that
   this woman has been reconciled to God.

   44. And turning to the woman. The Lord appears to compare Simon with
   the woman, in such a manner as to make him chargeable with nothing more
   than light offenses. But this is spoken only in the way of concession.
   "Suppose now, Simon," he says, "that the guilt from which God
   discharges thee was light, [244] and that this woman has been guilty of
   many and very heinous offenses. Yet you see how she proves by the
   effect that she has obtained pardon. For what mean those profuse tears,
   those frequent kisses of the feet, that precious ointment? What mean
   they but to acknowledge, that she had been weighed down by an enormous
   burden of condemnation? And now she regards the mercy of God with
   fervor of love proportioned to her conviction that her necessity had
   been great."

   From the words of Christ, therefore, we are not at liberty to infer,
   that Simon had been a debtor to a small amount, or that he was absolved
   from guilt. [245] It is more probable that, as he was a blind
   hypocrite, he was still plunged in the filth of his sins. But Christ
   insists on this single point, that, however wicked the woman may have
   been, she gave undoubted proofs of her righteousness, by leaving no
   kind of duty undone to testify her gratitude, and by acknowledging, in
   every possible way, her vast obligations to God. At the same time,
   Christ reminds Simon, that he has no right to flatter himself, as if he
   were free from all blame; for that he too needed mercy; and that if
   even he does not obtain the favor of God without pardon, he ought to
   look upon this woman's gifts, whatever might have been her former sins,
   as evidences of repentance and gratitude.

   We must attend to the points of contrast, in which the woman is
   preferred to Simon. She moistened his feet with tears, and wiped them
   with the hairs of her head; while he did not even order water to be
   given, according to custom. She did not cease to kiss his feet, while
   he did not deign to receive Christ with the kiss of hospitality. [246]
   She poured precious ointment on his feet, while he did not even anoint
   his head with oil. But why did our Lord, who was a model of frugality
   and economy, permit the expense of the ointment? It was because, in
   this way, the wretched sinner testified that she owed all to him. He
   had no desire of such luxuries, was not gratified by the sweet odor,
   and did not approve of gaudy dress. But he looked only at her
   extraordinary zeal to testify her repentance, which is also held out to
   us by Luke as an example; for her sorrow, which is the commencement of
   repentance, was proved by her tears. By placing herself at Christ's
   feet behind him, and there lying on the ground, she discovered her
   modesty and humility. By the ointment, she declared that she offered,
   as a sacrifice to Christ, herself and all that she possessed. Every one
   of these things it is our duty to imitate; but the pouring of the
   ointment was an extraordinary act, which it would be improper to
   consider as a rule. [247]

   47. Her many sins are forgiven Some interpret the verb differently, may
   her many sins be forgiven, and bring out the following meaning: -- "As
   this woman evinces by remarkable actions, that she is full of ardent
   love to Christ, it would be improper for the Church to act harshly and
   severely towards her; but, on the contrary, she ought to be treated
   with gentleness, whatever may have been the aggravations of her
   offenses." But as apheontai is used, in accordance with the Athic
   dialect, for apheintai, we must dispense with that subtlety of
   exposition which is disapproved by the context; for a little after,
   Christ uses the same words in his address to the woman, where the
   imperative mood would not apply. Here, too is added a corresponding
   clause, that he to whom less is forgiven loveth less

   The verb, which is in the present tense, must, no doubt, be resolved
   into a preterite. [248] From the eager desire which she had manifested
   to discharge all the duties of piety, Christ infers that, although this
   woman might have been guilty of many sins, the mercy of God was so
   abundant towards her, that she ought no longer to be regarded as a
   sinner. Again, loving is not here said to be the cause of pardon, [249]
   but a subsequent manifestation, as I have formerly mentioned; for the
   meaning of the words is this: -- "They who perceive the display of deep
   piety in the woman form an erroneous judgment, if they do not conclude
   that God is already reconciled to her;" so that the free pardon of sins
   comes first in order. Christ does not inquire at what price men may
   purchase the favor of God, but argues that God has already forgiven
   this wretched sinner, and that, therefore, a mortal man ought not to
   treat her with severity.

   48. Thy sins are forgiven. It may be asked, why does Christ now promise
   to her the pardon which she had obtained, and of which she had been
   assured? Some reply that these words were uttered, not so much on her
   own account, as for the sake of others. For my own part, I have no
   doubt that it was chiefly on her own account; and this appears more
   clearly from the words that follow. Nor ought we to wonder, that the
   voice of Christ again pronounces an absolution of the woman, who had
   already tasted his grace, and who was even convinced that he was her
   only refuge of salvation. Thus, at the present day, faith is previously
   necessary, when we pray that the Lord would forgive our sins; and yet
   this is not a useless or superfluous prayer, but the object of it is,
   that the heavenly Judge may more and more seal his mercy on our hearts,
   and in this manner may give us peace. Though this woman had brought
   with her a confident reliance on that grace which she had obtained, yet
   this promise was not superfluous, but contributed greatly to the
   confirmation of her faith.

   49. And those who sat at table with him began to say within themselves.
   Hence we again learn, that ignorance of Christ's office constantly
   leads men to conceive new grounds of offense. The root of the evil is,
   that no one examines his own wretched condition, which undoubtedly
   would arouse every man to seek a remedy. There is no reason to wonder
   that hypocrites, who slumber amidst their vices, [250] should murmur at
   it as a thing new and unexpected, when Christ forgives sins.

   50. Thy faith hath saved thee. To repress those murmurings, [251] and,
   at the same time, to confirm the woman, Christ commends her faith. Let
   others grumble as they may, but do thou adhere steadfastly to that
   faith which has brought thee an undoubted salvation. [252] At the same
   time, Christ claims for himself the authority which had been given to
   him by the Father; for, as he possesses the power of healing, to him
   faith is properly directed. And this intimates that the woman was not
   led by rashness or mistake to come to him, but that, through the
   guidance of the Spirit, she had preserved the straight road of faith.
   Hence it follows, that we cannot believe in any other than the Son of
   God, without considering that person to have the disposal of life and
   death. If the true reason for believing in Christ be, that God hath
   given him authority to forgive sins, whenever faith is rendered to
   another, that honor which is due to Christ must of necessity be taken
   from him. This saying refutes also the error of those who imagine that
   the forgiveness of sins is purchased by charity; for Christ lays down a
   quite different method, which is, that we embrace by faith the offered
   mercy. The last clause, Go in peace, denotes that inestimable fruit of
   faith which is so frequently commended in Scripture. It brings peace
   and joy to the consciences, and prevents them from being driven hither
   and thither by uneasiness and alarm.

   Luke 10:38-42

   Luke 10:38-42

   38. And it happened, while they were traveling, that he entered into a
   certain village; and a certain woman, called Martha, received him into
   her house. 39. And she had a sister called Mary, who also, sitting at
   the feet of Jesus, heard his word. 40. And Martha was cumbered about
   much serving; who stood, and said, Lord, hast thou no care that my
   sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore assist me.
   41. And Jesus answering said to her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxious
   and distressed about many things. 42 But one thing is necessary: Mary
   hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken from her.


   38. And it happened that he entered into a certain village. This
   narrative shows, that Christ, wherever he came, did not devote himself
   to his private concerns, or consult his own ease or comfort; but that
   the single object which he kept in view was, to do good to others, and
   to discharge the office which had been committed to him by the Father.
   Luke relates that, having been hospitably received by Martha, as soon
   as he entered the house, he began to teach and exhort. As this passage
   has been basely distorted into the commendation of what is called a
   Contemplative life, we must inquire into its true meaning, from which
   it will appear, that nothing was farther from the design of Christ,
   than to encourage his disciples to indulge in indolence, or in useless
   speculations. It is, no doubt, an old error [253] , that those who
   withdraw from business, and devote themselves entirely to a
   contemplative, lead an Angelical life. For the absurdities which the
   Sorbonnists [254] utter on this subject they appear to have been
   indebted to Aristotle, who places the highest good, and ultimate end,
   of human life in contemplation, which, according to him, is the
   enjoyment of virtue. When some men were driven by ambition to withdraw
   from the ordinary intercourse of life, or when peevish men gave
   themselves up to solitude and indolence, the resolution to adopt that
   course was followed by such pride, that they imagined themselves to be
   like the angels, because they did nothing; for they entertained as
   great a contempt for active life, as if it had kept them back from
   heaven. On the contrary, we know that men were created for the express
   purpose of being employed in labor of various kinds, and that no
   sacrifice is more pleasing to God, than when every man applies
   diligently to his own calling, and endeavors to live in such a manner
   as to contribute to the general advantage. [255]

   How absurdly they have perverted the words of Christ to support their
   own contrivance, will appear manifest when we have ascertained the
   natural meaning. Luke says that Mary sat at the feet of Jesus Does he
   mean that she did nothing else throughout her whole life? On the
   contrary, the Lord enjoins his followers to make such a distribution of
   their time, that he who desires to make proficiency in the school of
   Christ shall not always be an idle hearer but shall put in practice
   what he has learned; for there is a time to hear, and a time to act.
   [256] It is, therefore, a foolish attempt of the monks to take hold of
   this passage, as if Christ were drawing a comparison between a
   contemplative and an active life, while Christ simply informs us for
   what end, and in what manner, he wishes to be received.

   Though the hospitality of Martha deserved commendation, and is
   commended, yet there were two faults in it which are pointed out by
   Christ. The first is, that Martha carried her activity beyond proper
   bounds; for Christ would rather have chosen to be entertained in a
   frugal manner, and at moderate expense, than that the holy woman should
   have submitted to so much toil. The second fault was, that Martha, by
   distracting her attention, and undertaking more labor than was
   necessary, deprived herself of the advantage of Christ's visit. The
   excess is pointed out by Luke, when he speaks of much serving; for
   Christ was satisfied with little. It was just as if one were to give a
   magnificent reception to a prophet, and yet not to care about hearing
   him, but, on the contrary, to make so great and unnecessary
   preparations as to bury all the instruction. But the true way of
   receiving prophets is, to accept the advantage which God presents and
   offers to us through their agency.

   We now see that the kind attention of Martha, though it deserved
   praise, was not without its blemishes. There was this additional evil,
   that Martha was so delighted with her own bustling operations, as to
   despise her sister's pious eagerness to receive instruction. [257] This
   example warns us, that, in doing what is right, we must take care not
   to think more highly of ourselves than of others.

   42. But one thing is necessary. Some give a very meager interpretation
   of these words, as if they meant that one sort of dish is enough. [258]
   Others make ingenious inquiries, but beside the purpose, about Unity.
   [259] But Christ had quite another design, which was, that whatever
   believers may undertake to do, and in whatever employments they may
   engage, there is one object to which every thing ought to be referred.
   In a word, we do but wander to no purpose, if we do not direct all our
   actions to a fixed object. The hospitality of Martha was faulty in this
   respect, that she neglected the main business, and devoted herself
   entirely to household affairs. And yet Christ does not mean that every
   thing else, with the exception of this one thing, is of no importance,
   but that we must pay a proper attention to order, lest what is
   accessory--as the phrase is--become our chief concern.

   Mary hath chosen the good part. There is no comparison here, as
   unskillful and mistaken interpreters dream. Christ only declares, that
   Mary is engaged in a holy and profitable employment, in which she ought
   not to be disturbed. "You would have a good right," he says, "to blame
   your sister, if she indulged in ease, or gave herself up to trifling
   occupations, or aimed at something unsuitable to her station, and left
   to you the whole charge of the household affairs. But now, when she is
   properly and usefully employed in hearing, it would be an act of
   injustice to withdraw her from it; for an opportunity so favorable is
   not always in her power." There are some, indeed, who give a different
   interpretation to the latter clause, which shall not be taken away from
   her, as if Christ intended to say, that Mary hath chosen the good part,
   because the fruit of heavenly doctrine can never perish. For my own
   part, I have no objection to that opinion, but have followed the view
   which appeared to me to be more in accordance with Christ's design.

   Sorbonne, in Paris, takes its name from Robert de Sorbonne, who founded
   it in the middle of the thirteenth century. Its reputation for
   theological learning, philosophy, classical literature, and all that
   formerly constituted a liberal education, was deservedly high. In the
   Doctors of the Sorbonne the Reformation found powerful adversaries. The
   very name of this University, to which the greatest scholars in Europe
   were accustomed to pay deference, would be regarded by the multitude
   with blind veneration. If such men as Calvin, Beza, Melancthon, and
   Luther, were prepared by talents and acquirements of the first order to
   brave the terrors of that name, they must have frequently lamented its
   influence on many of their hearers. Yet our author meets undaunted this
   formidable array, and enters the field with the full assurance of
   victory. Despising, as we naturally do, the weak superstitions and
   absurd tenets held by the Church of Rome, we are apt to underrate our
   obligations to the early champions of the Reformed faith, who
   encountered with success those veteran warriors, and contended
   earnestly (Jude, verse 3) for the faith which was once delivered to the
   saints."--(Biblical Cabinet, volume 30, p. 140.)--Ed.

   [260] Calvin appears to interpret the words, which shall not be taken
   from her, not as a doctrinal statement, but as a command, or, at least,
   as marking out the line of conduct which ought to be pursued by Martha
   and others towards Mary. The good part, or, as he explains it, "the
   holy and profitable employment," shall not be take, from her. "She
   ought not to be disturbed," and "it would be an act of injustice to
   withdraw her from it." -- Ed.

   Luke 12:13-21

   Luke 12:13-21

   13. And one out of the multitude said to him, Master, bid my brother
   divide the inheritance with me. 14. And he said to him, Man, who made
   me a judge or a divider over you? 15. And he said to them, Take heed
   and beware of covetousness; for the life of any man does not consist in
   the abundance of those things which he possesseth. [261] 16. And he
   spoke a parable to them, saying, The field of a certain rich man
   yielded an abundant produce. 17. And he thought within himself, saying,
   What shall I do? for I have no place in which I can collect my fruits.
   18. And he said, I will do this: I will pull down my barns, and will
   build larger ones, and there I will collect all my fruits and my goods.
   19. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast many goods laid up for
   many, years: take thine ease, eat, drink, and enjoy thyself. [262]
   20. But God said to him, Fool, this night they shall demand thy soul
   from thee; [263] and as to the things which thou hast provided, to whom
   shall they go? 21. So is he that layeth up for himself: [264] and is
   not rich toward God.


   13. Bid my brother divide Our Lord, when requested to undertake the
   office of dividing an inheritance, refuses to do so. Now as this tended
   to promote brotherly harmony, and as Christ's office was, not only to
   reconcile men to God, but to bring them into a state of agreement with
   one another, what hindered him from settling the dispute between the
   two brothers? [265] There appear to have been chiefly two reasons why
   he declined the office of a judge. First, as the Jews imagined that the
   Messiah would have an earthly kingdom, [266] he wished to guard against
   doing any thing that might countenance this error. If they had seen him
   divide inheritances, the report of that proceeding would immediately
   have been circulated. Many would have been led to expect a carnal
   redemption, which they too ardently desired; and wicked men would have
   loudly declared, that he was effecting a revolution in the state, and
   overturning the Roman Empire. Nothing could be more appropriate,
   therefore, than this reply, by which all would be informed, that the
   kingdom of Christ is spiritual. Let us learn from this to regulate our
   conduct by prudence, and to undertake nothing which may admit of an
   unfavorable construction.

   Secondly, our Lord intended to draw a distinction between the political
   kingdoms of this world and the government of his Church; for he had
   been appointed by the Father to be a Teacher, who should

   divide asunder, by the sword of the word, the thoughts and feelings,
   and penetrate into the souls of men,
   (Hebrews 4:12,)

   but was not a magistrate to divide inheritances This condemns the
   robbery of the Pope and his clergy, who, while they give themselves out
   to be pastors of the Church, have dared to usurp an earthly and secular
   jurisdiction, which is inconsistent with their office; for what is in
   itself lawful may be improper in certain persons.

   There was also in my opinion, a third reason of great weight. Christ
   saw that this man was neglecting doctrine, and was looking only to his
   private concerns. This is too common a disease. Many who profess the
   Gospel do not scruple to make use of it as a false pretense for
   advancing their private interests, and to plead the authority of Christ
   as an apology for their gains. From the exhortations [267] which is
   immediately added, we may readily draw this inference; for if that man
   had not availed himself of the Gospel as a pretext for his own
   emolument, Christ would not have taken occasion to give this warning
   against covetousness The context, therefore, makes it sufficiently
   evident, that this was a pretended disciple, whose mind was entirely
   occupied with lands or money.

   It is highly absurd in the Anabaptists to infer from this reply, that
   no Christian man has a right to divide inheritances, to take a part in
   legal decisions, or to discharge any public office. Christ does not
   argue from the nature of the thing itself, but from his own calling.
   Having been appointed by the Father for a different purpose, he
   declares that he is not a judge, because he has received no such
   command. Let us hold by this rule, that every one keep within the
   limits of the calling which God has given him.

   15. Take heed and beware of covetousness. Christ first guards his
   followers against covetousness, and next, in order to cure their minds
   entirely of this disease, he declares, that our life consisteth not in
   abundance. These words point out the inward fountain and source, from
   which flows the mad eagerness for gain. It is because the general
   belief is, that a man is happy in proportion as he possesses much, and
   that the happiness of life is produced by riches. Hence arise those
   immoderate desires, which, like a fiery furnace, send forth their
   flames, and yet cease not to burn within. If we were convinced that
   riches, and any kind of abundance, are evils of the present life, which
   the Lord bestows upon us with his own hand, and the use of which is
   accompanied by his blessing, this single consideration would have a
   powerful influence in restraining all wicked desires; and this is what
   believers have come to learn from their own experience. [268] For
   whence comes it, that they moderate their wishes, and depend on God
   alone, but because they do not look upon their life as necessarily
   connected with abundance, or dependent upon it, but rely on the
   providence of God, who alone upholds us by his power, and supplies us
   with whatever is necessary?

   16. And he spoke a parable to them This parable presents to us, as in a
   mirror, a lively portrait of this sentiment, that men do not live by
   their abundance. Since the life even of the richest men is taken away
   in a moment, what avails it that they have accumulated great wealth?
   All acknowledge it to be true, so that Christ says nothing here but
   what is perfectly common, and what every man has constantly in his
   mouth. But where is the man that honestly believes it? Do not all, on
   the contrary, regulate their life, and arrange their schemes and
   employments in such a manner as to withdraw to the greatest distance
   from God, making their life to rest on a present abundance of good
   things? It is therefore necessary that all should immediately arouse
   themselves, lest, by imagining their happiness to consist in riches,
   they entangle themselves in the snares of covetousness.

   This parable shows us, first, that the present life is short and
   transitory. Secondly, it points out to us, that riches are of no avail
   for prolonging life. We must add a third, which is not expressed, but
   may easily be inferred from the other two; that it is a most excellent
   remedy for believers, to ask from the Lord their daily bread, and to
   rely on his providence alone, whether they are rich or poor.

   17. What shall I do? Wicked men are driven to perplexity in their
   deliberations, because they do not know how any thing is to be lawfully
   used; [269] and, next, because they are intoxicated with a foolish
   confidence which makes them forget themselves. Thus we find that this
   rich man lengthens out his expectation of life in proportion to his
   large income, and drives far away from him the remembrance of death.
   And yet this pride is accompanied by distrust; for those men, when they
   have had their fill, are still agitated by insatiable desire, like this
   rich man, who enlarges his barns, as if his belly, which had been
   filled with his former barns, had not got enough. At the same time,
   Christ does not expressly condemn this man for acting the part of a
   careful householder in storing up his produce, but because his ravenous
   desire, like a deep whirlpool, swallows up and devours many barns; from
   which it follows that he does not comprehend the proper use of an
   abundant produce.

   19. Take thine ease, eat, drink, enjoy thyself. When he exhorts himself
   to eat and drink, he no longer remembers that he is a man, but swells
   into pride by relying on his abundance. We daily perceive striking
   instances of this disdainful conduct [270] in irreligious men, who hold
   up the mass of their riches, as if it were nothing less than a brazen
   rampart against death. When he says, Eat, my soul, and enjoy thyself,
   there is an emphatic meaning in this Hebrew idiom; [271] for he
   addresses himself in such a manner as to imply, that he has all that is
   necessary for gratifying all his senses and all his desires.

   20. Fool, this night they will demand thy soul from thee. The word soul
   carries an allusion. Formerly, the rich man addressed his soul as the
   seat of all the affections: but now, he speaks of the life itself, or
   the vital spirit. The words, they will demand, (apaitousin) though in
   the plural number, are used indefinitely, and mean nothing more than
   that the life of the rich man, which he imagined to be in his own
   power, was at the disposal of another. I advert to this, because some
   take occasion from them to make unfounded speculations about angels.
   The design of Christ is simply to show that the life of men, which they
   imagine to be strongly protected by the fortress of their riches, is
   every moment [272] taken away. The rich man is thus convicted of folly,
   in not knowing that his life depended on another.

   21. So is he that layeth up for himself. As the two clauses are
   evidently contrasted, the one must be taken into account for the
   exposition of the other. Let us ascertain, therefore, what is meant by
   being rich in God, or, "towards God" or, "with respect to God." Those
   who are tolerably acquainted with the Scriptures know that the
   preposition eis not unfrequently takes the sense of en. But whether it
   be understood in the one sense or in the other, is of little
   consequence; for the meaning comes to this, that they are rich
   according to God, who do not trust to earthly things, but depend solely
   on his providence. It matters not whether they are in abundance or in
   want, provided that both classes present their sincere prayers to the
   Lord for their daily bread. The corresponding phrase, layeth up for
   himself, conveys the idea that this man paid no attention to the
   blessing of God, but anxiously heaped up an immense store, so that his
   confidence was shut up in his barns. [273] Hence we may easily conclude
   that the parable was intended to show, that vain are the deliberations
   and foolish attempts of those who, trusting to the abundance of their
   wealth, do not rely on God alone, and are not satisfied with their own
   share, or prepared for whatever may befall them; [274] and, finally,
   that such persons will suffer the penalty of their own folly.

   Luke 13:1-9

   Luke 13:1-9

   1. And at that time some were present, who told him of the Galileans,
   whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. 2. And Jesus
   answering said to them, Do you imagine that these Galileans were
   sinners beyond all the Galileans, because they suffered such things?
   3. I tell you, no; but unless you repent, you will all perish in like
   manner. 4. Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloah fell and slew
   them, do you imagine that they were debtors beyond all men that dwell
   in Jerusalem? [275] 5. I tell you, no; but unless you repent, you shall
   all perish in like manner. 6. And he spake this parable: A certain man
   had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard, and came seeking fruit on it,
   and did not find it. 7. And he said to the vine-dresser, Lo, there are
   three years that I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree, and find none:
   cut it down; why does it even occupy the ground? [276] 8. But he
   answering, said to him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall
   dig about it, and dung it: 9. And if it bear fruit: [277] but if not,
   afterwards thou shalt cut it down.


   2. Do you imagine? etc. This passage is highly useful, were it for no
   other reason than that this disease is almost natural to us, to be too
   rigorous and severe in judging of others, and too much disposed to
   flatter our own faults. The consequence is, that we not only censure
   with excessive severity the offenses of our brethren; but whenever they
   meet with any calamity, we condemn them as wicked and reprobate
   persons. On the other hand, every man that is not sorely pressed by the
   hand of God slumbers at ease in the midst of his sins, as if God were
   favorable and reconciled to him. This involves a double fault; for when
   God chastises any one before our eyes, he warns us of his judgments,
   that each of us may examine himself, and consider what he deserves. If
   he spares us for a time, we are so far from having a right to take such
   kindness and forbearance as an opportunity for slumber, that we ought
   to regard it as an invitation to repentance.

   To correct the false and cruel judgment which we are accustomed to pass
   on wretched sufferers, and, at the same time, to shake off the
   indulgence which every man cherishes towards himself, he shows, first,
   that those who are treated with severity are not the most wicked of all
   men; because God administers his judgments in such a manner, that some
   are instantly seized and punished, and others are permitted to remain
   long in the enjoyment of ease and luxury, Secondly, he declares that
   all the calamities which happen in the world are so many demonstrations
   of the wrath of God; and hence we learn what an awful destruction
   awaits us, [278] if we do not avert it.

   The immediate occasion for this exhortation was, that some told him
   that Pilate had mingled human blood with sacrifices, in order that so
   shocking an event might bring sacrifices into abhorrence. As it is
   probable that this outrage was committed on the Samaritans, who had
   departed from the pure service of the Law, the Jews would easily and
   readily be disposed to condemn the Samaritans, and by so doing to
   applaud themselves. But our Lord applies it to a different purpose. As
   that whole nation was hated and detested by them on account of
   ungodliness, he puts the question, "Do you imagine that those wretched
   persons, who have been put to death by Pilate, were worse than others?
   You are perfectly aware, that that country is full of ungodly men, and
   that many who deserved the same punishment are still alive. He is a
   blind and wicked judge who decides as to the sins of all men by the
   punishments which they now endure. It is not always the most wicked man
   who is first dragged to punishment; but when God selects a few out of a
   large number to be punished, he holds out in their person a threatening
   that he will take vengeance on the remainder, in order that all may be
   alarmed."

   Having spoken of the Samaritans, he now approaches more closely to the
   Jews themselves. Eighteen men had at that time been killed by the fall
   of a tower in Jerusalem. He declares that those men were not more
   wicked than others, but that their death was held out to all as a
   ground of alarm; for if in them God gave a display of his judgment, no
   more would others, though they might be spared for a time, escape his
   hand. Christ does not, however, forbid believers to consider
   attentively the judgments of God, but enjoins them to observe this
   order, to begin with their own sins. They will thus obtain the highest
   advantage; for they will avert God's chastisements by voluntary
   repentance. To the same purpose is the warning which Paul gives,

   Let no man deceive you with vain words; for on account of these things
   the wrath of God cometh against the rebellious,
   (Ephesians 5:6.)

   6. He spoke also this parable. The substance of it is, that many are
   endured for a time who deserve to be cut off; but that they gain
   nothing by the delay, if they persist in their obstinacy. The wicked
   flattery, by which hypocrites are hardened, and become more obstinate,
   arises from this cause, that they do not think of their sins till they
   are compelled; and, therefore, so long as God winks at these, and
   delays his chastisements, they imagine that he is well satisfied with
   them. Thus they indulge themselves more freely, as if, to use the words
   of Isaiah, (28:15,) they had made a covenant with death, and were in
   friendship with the grave. And this is the reason why Paul denounces
   them in such earnestness of language for

   treasuring up to themselves the wrath of God against the last day,
   (Romans 2:5.)

   It is well known that trees are sometimes preserved, not because their
   owners find them to be useful and productive, but because the careful
   and industrious husbandman makes every possible trial and experiment
   before he determines to remove them out of the field or vineyard. This
   teaches us that, when the Lord does not immediately take vengeance on
   the reprobate, but delays to punish them, there are the best reasons
   for his forbearance. Such considerations serve to restrain human
   rashness, that no man may dare to murmur against the supreme Judge of
   all, if He does not always execute his judgments in one uniform manner.
   A comparison is here drawn between the owner and the vine-dresser: not
   that God's ministers go beyond him in gentleness and forbearance, but
   because the Lord not only prolongs the life of sinners, but likewise
   cultivates them in a variety of ways, that they may yield better fruit.

   Luke 13:10-17

   Luke 13:10-17

   10. And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
   11. And, lo, a woman who had a spirit of infirmity during eighteen
   years, and was bent down, and was altogether unable to lift up her
   head. [279] 12. Whom when Jesus saw, he called her to him, and said to
   her, Woman, thou art delivered from thine infirmity. 13. And he laid
   his hands on her, and immediately she stood upright, and glorified God.
   14. And the ruler of the synagogue answering, being offended because
   Christ had performed a cure on the Sabbath, said to the multitude,
   There are six days on which we ought to work: on them therefore come,
   and you shall be cured, and not on the Sabbath-day. 15. And the Lord
   answering said to her, Doth not each of you, on the Sabbath, loose his
   ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering? 16. And
   must not this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, eighteen
   years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath-day? 17. And while he
   was saying these things, all his adversaries were ashamed, and all the
   people rejoiced on account of all the glorious actions which were done
   by him.


   I have resolved to place in immediate connection some events which are
   detailed by Luke alone, without a direct reference to dates; for on
   that point, as we have formerly mentioned, the Evangelists did not care
   much about exactness. We shall afterwards find a more suitable time for
   returning to the Harmony of the Three Evangelists.

   11. And, lo, a woman Here is related a miracle performed on a woman who
   was cured, and the offense which the malignity of the Jews led them to
   take up, because our Lord had cured her on a Sabbath-day Luke says that
   the woman was held by a spirit of infirmity, so that her body was bent
   by the contraction of her nerves. As the nature of the disease is no
   farther described, it is probable that it was not one of an ordinary
   kind, or which was understood by physicians; and, therefore, he calls
   it a spirit of infirmity. We know that diseases of an unusual and
   extraordinary kind are, for the most part, inflicted on men through the
   agency of the devil; and this gave the more striking display of the
   divine power of Christ, which triumphed over Satan. Not that Satan
   rules over men according to his pleasure, but only so far as God grants
   to him permission to injure them. Besides, as the Lord, from whom alone
   all our blessings flow, makes his glory to shine with peculiar
   brightness in those blessings which are more remarkable, and of rare
   occurrence; so, on the other hand, it is his will that the power and
   tyranny of Satan should be chiefly regarded in extraordinary
   chastisements, though his agency is likewise employed in those more
   gentle applications of the rod, which we experience from day to day.

   12. Woman, thou art delivered In this miracle, as well as in others,
   Christ exhibited a proof both of his power and of his grace; for in
   this manner he testified that he had come for the purpose of granting
   relief to the wretched. His power is expressed in these words, Woman,
   thou art delivered; for he authoritatively declares that deliverance
   was at his own disposal, and employs, at the same time, the outward
   sign, the use of which we have explained on a former occasion.

   13. And glorified God. As to the people glorifying God, it is mentioned
   in order to inform us, that this was distinctly perceived to be a
   heavenly blessing. It was not some doubtful work which allowed room for
   argument on either side, but one which afforded ample and undoubted
   grounds for praising God. This discovers more strongly the malignity of
   the ruler of the synagogue

   14. There are six days. This reprover does not venture to pass censure
   openly on Christ, but points the venom of his dislike to another
   quarter, and indirectly condemns Christ in the person of the multitude.
   What an astonishing display of furious malice! Six days, he tells them,
   were set apart for labor; but how incorrectly and foolishly does he
   define that work, which is not permitted but on six days! Why does he
   not likewise forbid them to enter the synagogue, lest they should
   violate the Sabbath? Why does he not order them to refrain from all the
   exercises of godliness? But granting that men are restrained from
   following their own employments on the Sabbath-day, how unreasonable is
   it that the grace of God should be limited in that manner!

   On them, therefore, come and you shall be cured. He bids them come on
   the other days to seek a cure, as if the power of God lay asleep on
   Sabbath, and were not rather exerted chiefly on that day for the
   salvation of his people. What purpose is to be served by the holy
   assemblies, except to give an opportunity to believers for entreating
   the Divine assistance? That ungodly hypocrite talks as if the lawful
   observation of the Sabbath interrupted the course of God's favors,
   hindered men from calling upon him, and took away from them all feeling
   of his kindness.

   15. Doth not every one of you? etc Such a combination of malice and
   stupidity might easily have been exposed in many ways, but Christ
   satisfied himself with this single argument. If it be lawful on the
   Sabbath, to perform the offices of humanity to cattle, it is ridiculous
   to imagine that the due observance of it will prevent assistance from
   being granted to the children of God. The words of Christ present a
   twofold comparison: that of the cattle with the daughter of Abraham,
   and that of the halter by which the ass or the ox is tied to its stall
   with the chains of Satan, by which he holds men bound to their
   destruction. "You," says he, "who are so scrupulous about observing the
   Sabbath, venture to loose oxen and asses, and lead them away to
   watering. And why may not I be permitted to perform a similar office of
   kindness to the elect people of God; especially when the necessity is
   more urgent, when some one is to be delivered from the snares of
   Satan?"

   Now though the wicked reprover was struck dumb with shame, yet we
   perceive that Christ never performed any work, however illustrious,
   which wicked men did not seize as an occasion for slander. Nor need we
   wonder that Satan labored, with incessant zeal and exertions, to
   subvert the glory of Christ; for he is constantly employed in spreading
   his clouds, in order to darken the holy actions of believers.

   Luke 13:31-33

   Luke 13:31-33

   31. The same day some of the Pharisees came, saying to him, Depart, and
   go hence: for Herod intends to kill thee. 32. And he said to them, Go,
   tell that fox, Lo, I cast out devils, and I perform cures today and
   tomorrow, and the third day I am completed. [280] 33. But yet I must
   walk today and tomorrow, and the following day; for it is not a usual
   occurrence that a prophet perish anywhere else than in Jerusalem. [281]



   It deserves our attention, that Christ gives the designation, daughter
   of Abraham, to one whose body had been enslaved by Satan during
   eighteen years. She was so called, not only in reference to her
   lineage, as all the Jews without exception gloried in this title, but
   because she was one of the true and actual members of the Church. Here
   we perceive also what Paul tells us, that some are

   delivered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit
   may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus,
   (1 Corinthians 5:5.)

   And the length of time points out to us that, though the Lord does not
   immediately relieve our distresses, yet we ought not to despair.

   It is difficult to ascertain the precise time when this happened,
   farther than that Christ was at that time residing in Galilee, as
   during the whole period of his public calling he remained longer there
   than in any other place. Certain persons, wishing to be considered as
   his friends, advise him that, if he wishes to be in safety, he should
   go beyond the boundaries of Herod's jurisdiction. In what manner those
   who gave that advice were affected towards him we have no means of
   knowing; but I am strongly inclined to conjecture, that they attempted
   to drive him to some other place, because they saw that the greater
   part of the people in that place were attached to Christ, so that the
   Gospel was generally received. We must observe who those advisers were.
   Luke says that they were some of the Pharisees Now we know that that
   sect was not so favorable to Christ as to make it probable that those
   men were anxious about his life. What then? Their design was, to awaken
   in him such fears as would drive him to some place of concealment; for
   they expected that, in a short time, his authority would decline, and
   that his whole doctrine would vanish away. But we must also direct our
   attention to the first originator and contriver of this scheme, Satan;
   for, as he endeavored at that time to interrupt the progress of the
   Gospel, by terrifying the Son of God, so he constantly invents and
   hatches up new grounds of alarm, to strike the ministers of Christ with
   dismay, and to constrain them to turn aside.

   32. Go, tell that fox It is certain, that the person here spoken of is
   Herod Antipas. Though he had throughout the character of a fox, and was
   as remarkable for servility as for cunning, I do not think that the
   term, fox, is intended to refer generally to the cunning of his whole
   life, but rather to the insidious methods by which he labored to
   undermine the doctrine of the Gospel, when he did not venture to attack
   it openly. Christ tells him that, with all his craftiness, he will gain
   nothing by his schemes. "Whatever artifices he may devise," says
   Christ, "today and tomorrow I will discharge the office which God has
   enjoined upon me; and when I shall have reached the end of my course, I
   shall then be offered in sacrifice." That we may perceive more clearly
   the meaning of the words, Christ acknowledges, in the former part of
   his message, that on the third day--that is, within a very short
   time--he must die; and in this way shows, that he could not be deterred
   from his duty by any fear of death, to which he advanced boldly, with
   fixed purpose of mind.

   33. It does not usually happen, etc. He next adds, that it is an idle
   bugbear, which is held out by false and hypocritical advisers; because
   there is no danger of death anywhere else than at Jerusalem. In this
   second clause he sharply attacks the Pharisees. "Is it you, who -- I
   foresee -- will be my executioners, that advise me to beware of Herod?"
   The reproof extends, indeed, much farther; for he says, not only that
   preparations had been made for his own death in Jerusalem, but that it
   might be said to have been, for a long period, a den of robbers, in
   which almost all the prophets had been murdered. Many had, no doubt,
   been slain in other places, and particularly at the time when that
   cruel fury, [282] Jezebel, (1 Kings 19:2,) raged against them; but
   because in no other place had the prophets, at any time, been fiercely
   tormented, Christ justly brings this reproach against the ungodly
   inhabitants of the holy city.

   It usually happened that the prophets were slain there; because not
   only was it the source of all the ungodliness which spread over the
   whole of Judea, but it was also the field on which God trained his
   prophets. [283] We know that the more brightly the light of doctrine
   shines, so as to press more closely on wicked men, they are driven to a
   greater pitch of madness. What a dreadful example was it, that a place
   which had been chosen to be the sanctuary of divine worship, and the
   residence of the Law and of heavenly wisdom, should be polluted not by
   one or another murder,, but by a regular butchery of the prophets! It
   undoubtedly shows how obstinate is the rebellion of the world in
   rejecting sound doctrine.

   The exclamation which immediately follows in Luke, (13:34,) appears to
   be connected in such a manner, as if Christ had taken occasion from the
   present occurrence to inveigh, at this time, against Jerusalem But for
   my own part, I rather think, that Luke, having said that Jerusalem had
   been formerly stained by the blood of the prophets, nay, had been,
   through an uninterrupted succession of many ages, the slaughter-place,
   where the prophets were cruelly and wickedly put to death, immediately
   inserts, according to his custom, a statement which harmonized with
   that discourse. We have seen, on former occasions, that it is by no
   means unusual with him to introduce into one place a collection of
   Christ's sayings, which were uttered at various times.

   Luke 11:37-41

   Luke 11:37-41

   37. And while he was speaking, a certain Pharisee requested him to dine
   with him; and he entered and sat down at table. 38. And when the
   Pharisee saw it, he wondered that he had not first washed before
   dinner. 39. And the Lord said to him, Now you Pharisees cleanse the
   outside of the cup and of the plate; and what is within you is full of
   cruelty and wickedness. 40. Fools, did not he who made what is without
   make also what is within? 41. But out of what you have [284] give alms;
   and, lo, all things are clean to you.



   This narrative agrees in some respects, but not entirely, with the
   doctrine laid down by Matthew, (10:1-20,) that Christ, in order to
   correct the superstition of the people, and particularly of the
   scribes, intentionally disregarded outward ceremonies of human
   invention, which the Jews were too solicitous to observe. God had
   prescribed in his Law certain kinds of washings, that by means of them
   he might train his people usefully to the consideration of true purity.
   The Jews, not satisfied with this moderate portion had added many other
   washings, and more especially, that no person should partake of food
   till he had been washed with the water of purification, as Mark relates
   more minutely, (12:3,4,) and as is also evident from John, (2:6.) This
   fault was accompanied by wicked confidence; for they cared little about
   the spiritual worship of God, and thought that they had perfectly
   discharged their duty, when the figure was substituted in the place of
   God. Christ is fully aware that his neglect of this ceremony will give
   offense, but he declines to observe it, in order to show that God sets
   very little value on outward cleanness, but demands the spiritual
   righteousness of the heart.

   39. Now you Pharisees Christ does not here charge the Pharisees, as in
   Matthew, (15:1-20,) and Mark, (12:2-13,) with serving God in an
   improper manner by human inventions, and breaking the law of God for
   the sake of their traditions; but merely glances at their hypocrisy, in
   having no desire of purity except before the eyes of men, as if they
   had not to deal with God. Now this reproof applies to all hypocrites,
   even to those who believe that righteousness consists in ceremonies
   appointed by God. Christ includes more than if he had said, that it is
   in vain to serve God by the commandments of men, (Mark 7:7;) for he
   condemns generally the error of worshipping God by ceremonies, and not
   spiritually, by faith and a pure affection of the heart.

   On this point the prophets had always contended earnestly with the
   Jews; but, as the minds of men are strongly inclined to hypocrisy, they
   proudly and obstinately adhered to the conviction, that God is pleased
   with external worship, even when it is not accompanied by faith. But in
   the time of Christ, they had sunk to such depth of folly, that they
   made religion to consist entirely in absolute trifles. Accordingly, he
   directs his accusation against the Pharisees, for being extremely
   careful to wash cups, and cherishing within their hearts the most
   abominable filth of cruelty and wickedness He charges them with folly
   on this ground, that God, who created that which is within the man, his
   soul, as truly as the body, cannot be satisfied with a mere external
   appearance. The chief reason why men are deceived is, that they do not
   consider that they have to deal with God, or, they transform Him
   according to the vanity of their senses, as if there were no difference
   between Him and a mortal man.

   41. But out of what you have, give alms. Christ, according to his
   custom, withdraws the Pharisees from ceremonies to charity, declaring
   that it is not water, but liberality, [285] that cleanses both men and
   food. By these words he does not disparage the grace of God, or reject
   the ceremonies of the Law as vain and useless; but addresses his
   discourse to those who feel confident that God will be amused by mere
   signs. "It is the lawful use alone," he says, "that sanctifies food.
   But food is rightly and properly used by those who supply from their
   abundance the necessities of the poor. It would therefore be better to
   give alms out of what you have, than to be careful about washing hands
   and cups, and to neglect the poor."

   The inference which the Papists draw from these words, that alms are
   satisfactions, by which we are cleansed from our sins, is too absurd to
   require a lengthened refutation. Christ does not here inform us by what
   price we must purchase the forgiveness of sins, but says that those
   persons eat their bread with cleanness, who bestow a part of it on the
   poor. I understand the words, ta enonta, to mean "the present supply,"
   [286] and not, as Erasmus and the old translator render them, "what
   remains over." [287]

   The reproofs which immediately follow may be reserved, with greater
   propriety, for another occasion. I do not think it probable that
   Christ, while sitting at table, indulged in this continuous strain of
   invective against scribes and Pharisees, but that Luke has introduced
   here what was spoken at another time; for the Evangelists, as we have
   frequently mentioned, paid little attention to the order of dates.

   Luke 14:1-6

   Luke 14:1-6

   1. And it happened that he entered into the house of a certain ruler of
   the Pharisees on a Sabbath, to take food, and they watched him. 2. And,
   lo, a certain man who had a dropsy was before him, 3. And Jesus
   answering said to the lawyers [288] and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful
   to cure on the Sabbath? 4. But they were silent; and he took and cured
   him, and sent him away. 5. And he answering to them said, Which of you
   shall have an ass or an ox that shall fall into a pit, and will not
   immediately pull him out on the Sabbath-day? 6. And they could not
   answer him to these things.



   This narrative contains nothing more than a miracle which Christ
   performed, in order to correct the superstitious observance of the
   Sabbath. For he did not, intend, as some imagine, absolutely to abolish
   the Sabbath, but only to point out, that neither the works of God, nor
   the duties of charity, violate the holy rest which is enjoined by the
   law. Whether or not those very persons had purposely brought the
   dropsical man to that place cannot be known with certainty. He
   unquestionably could not be present at the table by accident, nor break
   into a private dwelling without the permission and consent of the
   owner. It is therefore probable, that he was placed there with the
   concealed design of tempting Christ, which, on their part, was as
   foolish an action as it was wicked; for they had already known by
   experience what Christ was accustomed to do, whenever a similar
   occasion presented itself.

   3. Is it lawful to cure on Sabbath? The meaning of this question is,
   ought the curing of a man to be reckoned among the works which violate
   the Sabbath? If they had said that the observance of the Sabbath is
   violated in this way, the reply was obvious, that it is a work of God.
   Now the law of the Sabbath goes no farther, than that men shall rest
   from their own works. Christ first puts the question to them, and he
   does so for the purpose of guarding against offense. It would not have
   been necessary for him to pacify them, if they had not been instigated
   by hardened malice. Not that he always laid himself under this
   restriction; for in many cases he did what had been enjoined on him by
   the Father, without attending to the offense that might arise from it.
   But he intended to show by this example, that he did not
   inconsiderately perform miracles on Sabbath, because he was prepared to
   assign a reason for what he did. They, on the other hand, make it
   evident by their silence, that their desire of finding fault is
   stronger than their zeal for the law; and therefore Christ treats with
   utter indifference their opinion about his action, because it was
   evident that they intentionally sought out an occasion of offense.

   5. Which of you shall have an ox or an ass? Though they did not deserve
   that Christ should take pains to remove the offense, yet he shows that
   he did nothing inconsistent with the observance of the Sabbath. And
   this he undoubtedly does, not so much with the view of instructing
   them, as of protecting himself against their slanders; for he knew that
   they were too much blinded by virulent hatred to yield submissively, to
   argument, but wished to triumph over their malice, by compelling them
   through shame to be silent. If we are at liberty to relieve brute
   animals on Sabbath, it would be unreasonable that we should not perform
   a similar office of kindness to man, who is formed after the image of
   God.

   Luke 14:7-14

   Luke 14:7-14

   7. And he spoke a parable to those who were invited, observing how they
   chose the first seats, saying to them: 8. When thou shalt be invited by
   any one to a marriage, do not sit at table in the first seat, lest
   perhaps a more honorable person than thyself be invited by him, 9. And
   he who invited thee and him come and say to thee, Give place to this
   man, and thou begin then with shame to occupy the lowest place. 10. But
   on the contrary, when thou shalt be invited, go, and sit at table in
   the lowest place, that when he who hath invited thee shall come, he may
   say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have honor in
   presence of those who sit at table with thee. 11. For every one that
   exalteth himself shall be humbled, and he that humbleth himself shall
   be exalted. 12. And he said to him by whom he had been invited, When
   thou makest a dinner or supper, invite not thy friends, nor thy
   brethren, nor thy relatives, nor rich neighbors, lest they also in
   their turn invite thee, and a recompense be made thee. 13. But when
   thou makest a banquet, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the
   blind. 14. And thou shalt be blessed, because they cannot recompense
   thee; for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the
   righteous.



   7. And he spoke a parable to those who were invited. We know to what an
   extent ambition prevailed among the Pharisees and all the scribes.
   While they desired to exercise a haughty dominion over all other men,
   the superiority among themselves was likewise an object of emulation.
   It is constantly the case with men who are desirous of empty applause,
   that they cherish envy towards each other, every one endeavoring to
   draw to himself what others imagine to be due to them. Thus the
   Pharisees and scribes, while they were all equally disposed, in
   presence of the people, to glory in the title of holy order, are now
   disputing among themselves about the degree of honor, because every one
   claims for himself the highest place.

   This ambition of theirs Christ exposes to ridicule by an appropriate
   parable. If any one sitting at another man's table were to occupy the
   highest place, and were afterwards compelled to give way to a more
   honorable person, it would not be without shame and dishonor that he
   was ordered by the master of the feast to take a different place. But
   the same thing must happen to all who proudly give themselves out as
   superior to others; for God will bring upon them disgrace and contempt.
   It must be observed, that Christ is not now speaking of outward and
   civil modesty; for we often see that the haughtiest men excel in this
   respect, and civilly, as the phrase is, profess great modesty. But by a
   comparison taken from men, he describes what we ought to be inwardly
   before God. "Were it to happen that a guest should foolishly take
   possession of the highest place, and should, on that account, be put
   down to the lowest, he would be so completely overpowered with shame as
   to wish that he had never gone higher. Lest the same thing should
   happen to you, that God would punish your arrogance with the deepest
   disgrace, resolve, of your own accord, to be humble and modest."

   11. For every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled. This clause
   makes it evident that ambition was the subject of which Christ was
   speaking; for he does not state what usually happens in the ordinary
   life of men, but declares that God will be their Judge, who resisteth
   the proud, and humbleth their haughtiness, but giveth grace to the
   humble, (James 4:6; 1 Peter 5:5; Psalm 138:6.) Scripture is full of
   similar testimonies, that God is an enemy to all who desire to exalt
   themselves, as all who claim for themselves any merit must of necessity
   make war with Him. It is a manifestation of pride to boast of the gifts
   of God, as if there were any excellence in ourselves, that would exalt
   us on the ground of our own merit. Humility, on the other hand, must be
   not only an unfeigned abasement, but a real annihilation of ourselves,
   proceeding from a thorough knowledge of our own weakness, the entire
   absence of lofty pretensions, and a conviction that whatever excellence
   we possess comes from the grace of God alone.

   12. When thou makest a dinner. Those who think that this is an absolute
   condemnation of entertainments given by relatives and friends to each
   other, take away a part of civility from among men. It were not only
   unfeeling, but barbarous, to exclude relatives from the hospitable
   table, and to class them only with strangers. Christ did not intend to
   dissuade us from every thing courteous, but merely to show, that acts
   of civility, which are customary among men, are no proof whatever of
   charity. To perform any act, in the hope of a reward, to rich men, from
   whom we expect a similar return, is not generosity, but a system of
   commercial exchange; and, in like manner, kind offices, rendered from
   mercenary views, are of no account in the sight of God, and do not
   deserve to be ascribed to charity. If I entertain at supper my
   relatives or rich friends, the act of civility ought not in itself to
   be condemned, but, as a proof of charity, it will have no value
   whatever; for we frequently see that persons who are extremely selfish
   grudge no expense or luxury in treating their friends. What then? You
   may spread a table for the rich, but, at the same time, you must not
   neglect the poor; you may feast with your friends and relatives, but
   you must not shut out strangers, if they shall happen to be poor, and
   if you shall have the means of relieving their wants. In a word, the
   meaning of the passage is, that those who are kind to relatives and
   friends, but are niggardly towards the poor, are entitled to no
   commend-ation; because they do not exercise charity, but consult only
   their own gain or ambition.

   Christ addresses, in a particular manner, the person who had invited
   him; because he perceived that he was too much addicted to pomp and
   luxury, and was so desirous to obtain the applause and favor of the
   rich, that he cared very little about the poor. Accordingly, in the
   person of one man, this reproof is directed against all those who spend
   their wealth in ambitious display, or who bargain for mutual
   compensation, but leave nothing over for the poor, as if they were
   afraid that whatever is gratuitously bestowed would be lost.

   14. And thou shalt be blessed. Christ pronounces those to be blessed
   who exercise liberality without any expectation of earthly reward; for
   they manifestly look to God. Those who constantly keep in view their
   own advantage, or who are driven by the gale of popularity, have no
   right to expect a reward from God.

   Matthew 22:1-14; Luke 14:15-24

   Matthew 22:1-14

   Luke 14:15-24

   1. And Jesus answering, spoke again by parables, and said, 2. The
   kingdom of heaven is like a human king who made a marriage for his son,
   3. And sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the
   marriage, and they refused to come. 4. Again he sent out other
   servants, saying, Tell those who are invited, Lo, I have prepared my
   dinner, my oxen and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come
   to the marriage. 5. But they treated it with indifference, and went
   away, one to his farm, and another to his merchandise: 6. And the rest
   took his servants, and abused and killed them. 7. But when the king
   heard it, he was angry, and sent his soldiers, and slew these
   murderers, and burnt up their city. 8. Then he said to his servants,
   The marriage is indeed ready, but those who were invited were not
   worthy. 9. Go then to the highways, and whomsoever you shall find
   invite to the marriage. 10. And his servants went out to the roads, and
   collected all that they found, both bad and good, so that the
   marriage-apartment was filled with guests. 11. And the king, having
   come in to see the guests, when he saw there a man not wearing the
   wedding garment, 12. Said to him, Friend, how camest thou hither, not
   having the wedding garment? And he was speechless. 13. Then said the
   king to his attendants, Bind him hand and foot, and cast him into outer
   darkness: weeping and gnashing of teeth will be there. 14. For many are
   called, but few are chosen.


   15. And when one of those who sat at table with him heard these things,
   he said to him, Blessed is he that eateth [289] bread in the kingdom of
   God. 16. But he said to him, A certain man had prepared a great supper,
   and had invited many. 17. And he sent his servant at the hour of supper
   to say to those who were invited, Come; for all things are now ready.
   18. And they all began together [290] to excuse themselves. 19. The
   first said to him, I have purchased an estate, and I must go and see
   it: I beseech thee hold me excused. 20. And another said, I have
   married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. 21. And the servant
   returned, and brought back these things to his master. Then the master
   of the house, being angry, said to his servant, Go out quickly into the
   streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the
   maimed, and the lame, and the blind. 22. And the servant said, Sir, it
   is done as thou hast commanded, and still there is room. 23. And the
   master said to the servant, Go out to the roads and hedges, and compel
   them to come in, that my house may be filled. 24. For I say to you,
   That none of those men who were invited shall taste of my supper.



   Matthew 22:1. And Jesus answering. Though Matthew relates this parable
   among other discourses which were delivered by Christ about the time of
   the last Passover, yet as he does not specify any particular time, and
   as Luke expressly affirms that Christ delivered this discourse while he
   sat at table in the house of a Pharisee, I have thought it better to
   follow this order. The design which Matthew had in view was, to point
   out the reasons why the scribes were excited to the highest pitch of
   fury; and therefore he properly placed it in the midst of those
   discourses which were hateful to them, and interwove it with those
   discourses, without attending to the order of time. But we must attend
   to Luke's narrative, who says that, when one of those who sat at table
   with him said, Blessed is he that eateth bread in the kingdom of God,
   Christ took occasion from it to upbraid the Jews with ingratitude. It
   is by no means probable, that the guest and friend of a Pharisee broke
   out into this exclamation from any sincere feeling of piety. Still, I
   do not look upon it as having been spoken in derision; but, as persons
   who have a moderate knowledge of the faith, and are not openly wicked,
   are in the habit of indulging, amidst their cups, in idle talk about
   eternal life, I think that this man threw out a remark about future
   blessedness, in order to draw out some observation in return from
   Christ. And his words make it manifest, that he had nothing in view
   beyond what was gross and earthly; for he did not employ the phrase,
   eat bread, as a metaphor for enjoy eternal life, but appears to have
   dreamed of I know not what state, filled with prosperity and abundance
   of all things. The meaning is, Blessed shall they be who shall eat the
   bread of God, [291] after that he has collected his children into his
   kingdom.

   2. The kingdom of heaven is like a human king As it was long ago said
   by a Spartan, that the Athenians knew what was right, but did not
   choose to practice it; so Christ now brings it as a reproach against
   the Jews, that they gave utterance to beautiful expressions about the
   kingdom of God, but, when God kindly and gently invited them, they
   rejected his grace with disdain. There is no room to doubt that the
   discourse is expressly levelled against the Jews, as will more plainly
   appear a little afterwards.

   Matthew and Luke differ in this respect, that Matthew details many
   circumstances, while Luke states the matter summarily, and in a general
   manner. Thus, Matthew says that a king made a marriage for his son:
   Luke only mentions a great supper The former speaks of many servants,
   while the latter refers to no more than one servant; the former
   describes many messages, the latter mentions one only; the former says
   that some of the servants were abused or slain, the latter speaks only
   of their being treated with contempt. Lastly, the former relates that a
   man was cast out, who had gone in to the marriage without a wedding
   garment, of which Luke makes no mention. But we have formerly pointed
   out a similar distinction, that Matthew, in explaining the same thing,
   is more copious, and enters into fuller details. There is a remarkable
   agreement between them on the main points of the parable.

   God bestowed on the Jews distinguished honor, by providing for them, as
   it were, a hospitable table; but they despised the honor which had been
   conferred upon them. The marriage of the king's son is explained by
   many commentators to mean, that Christ is the end of the Law, (Romans
   10:4.) and that God had no other design in his covenant, than to make
   him the Governor of his people, and to unite the Church to him by the
   sacred bond of a spiritual marriage. I have no objection to that view.
   But when he says, that the servants were sent to call those who were
   invited, these words are intended to point out a double favor which the
   Jews had received from God; first, in being preferred to other nations;
   and, secondly, in having their adoption made known to them by the
   prophets. The allusion is to a practice customary among men, that those
   who intended to make a marriage drew up a list of the persons whom they
   intended to have as guests, and afterwards sent invitations to them by
   their servants. In like manner, God elected the Jews in preference to
   others, as if they had been his familiar friends, and afterwards called
   them by the prophets to partake of the promised redemption, which was,
   as it were, to feast at a marriage It is true that those who were first
   invited did not live till the coming of Christ; but we know that all
   received an offer of the same salvation, of which they were deprived by
   their ingratitude and malice; for from the commencement, God's
   invitation was impiously despised by that people. [292]

   4. Again he sent other servants. He speaks as if it had been the same
   persons who were invited, for it was one body of the people. The
   meaning is, that when the happy and joyful day of redemption drew near,
   they were warned to be ready; for they had been long ago informed as to
   the time. But now Christ told them that, at the very hour, fresh
   messengers were sent to entreat them to come with haste; for the first
   invitation which he mentions includes all the former prophecies, down
   to the publication of the Gospel. For a long period, they exercised
   cruelty on the prophets; but their fury grew as the time advanced, and
   at length spent all its force on Christ and the apostles. For this
   reason, he charges the ancient people with nothing more than contempt
   and pride, but says, that the servants who had been last sent, and who
   arrived at the hour of supper, were abused or slain. That people
   arrived at the highest pitch of their crimes, when their haughty
   rejection of his grace was followed by the madness of cruelty. And yet
   he does not charge all of them equally with crime; for even at the
   latest call, which was given by the Gospel, the grace of God was in
   part ridiculed by careless despisers, and in part was furiously
   rejected by hypocrites. And thus it usually happens, that ungodly men
   break out into fiercer rage against God, in proportion to the
   earnestness with which he invites them to salvation.

   We must now consider that part of doctrine which is conveyed both by
   Matthew and by Luke. One went to his field, and another to his
   merchandise; or, as Luke expresses it, one pleaded that he had married
   a wife; another that he had purchased a field; and another that he had
   bought five yoke of oxen. By these words Christ pronounces the Jews to
   have been so entirely devoted to the world and to earthly things, that
   no man found leisure to approach to God; for the cares of this world,
   when we become entangled by them, are so many impediments in our way to
   keep us back from the kingdom of God. It is truly base and shameful,
   that men who were created for a heavenly life, should be under the
   influence of such brutish stupidity, as to be entirely carried away
   after transitory things. But this disease is universally prevalent; so
   that hardly one person in a hundred can be found, who prefers the
   kingdom of God to fading riches, or to any other kind of advantages.
   Though all are not infected with the same disease, every man is led
   away by his desires; in consequence of which, all are wandering in
   various directions.

   Besides, it deserves our attention, that ungodly men hold out fair
   pretences for rejecting the grace of God; as if their indolence might
   be excused, because they are entirely occupied with the affairs of the
   present life, and care little about a heavenly inheritance. But we see
   how Christ takes from us all such excuses, that no man may imagine it
   to be of any advantage for him to plead that he is detained by
   engagements of an earthly nature. On the contrary, men commit a double
   fault, when they allow themselves to be retarded by those things which
   are in themselves lawful, and which ought rather to have aided their
   progress. For why does God allow us the conveniences of the present
   life, but in order to draw us to himself? And yet so far is it from
   being true, that all have earnest desires towards heaven, in proportion
   as they are assisted by acts of the Divine kindness, that even holy
   marriage, and fields, and other riches, are so many snares to bind
   every man more closely to the earth.

   7. But when the king heard it. This punishment is mentioned by Matthew
   alone; for Luke makes no mention of any outrage committed on the
   servants. Both concur in stating, that those who did not come at the
   appointed time were shut out, and deprived of the honor of being
   present at the banquet. But this doctrine applies equally to us; for
   the same destruction which Christ denounces against the Jews awaits all
   the ungodly, who violently oppose the ministers of the Gospel. Those
   who are so entirely occupied with earthly cares, as to set no value on
   the divine invitation, will at length perish miserably in famine and
   want; and therefore, whenever God calls us, let us be prepared and
   ready to follow.

   9. Go therefore to the highways. Having shown that they are unworthy of
   the grace of God who disdainfully reject it when offered to them, he
   now says that their place is supplied by others, by the mean and
   despised common people. And here is described the calling of the
   Gentiles, which is to excite the Jews to jealousy, as we have it in the
   Song of Moses;

   They have provoked me by those who are not gods, and I will provoke
   them by that which is not a people, and by a foolish nation will I
   enrage them,
   (Deuteronomy 32:21.)

   Having been first elected, they imagined that the grace of God was
   bound to them, as if God could not want them; and how haughtily they
   despised all others is well known. Thus by way of admission, he
   compares the Gentiles to the poor, the blind, and the lame. He says
   that they are called from the cross-roads, and from the streets, as
   strangers and unknown persons; but yet declares that they will occupy
   that place which friends and domestics had treated with indifference.
   What the prophets had obscurely foretold about creating a new church is
   now plainly expressed. This dishonor was the completion of the divine
   vengeance on the Jews, when God

   cut them off, and ingrafted wild branches into
   the stock of the olive-tree, (Romans 11:17;)

   when he threw them off, and received the polluted and filthy Gentiles
   into his house. But if at that time he spared not the natural branches,
   (Romans 11:21,) the same punishment will this day be inflicted on us,
   if we do not answer to his call. The supper which had been prepared for
   us will not be lost, but God will invite other guests.

   Luke 14:23. Compel them to come in. This expression means, that the
   master of the house would give orders to make use, as it were, of
   violence for compelling the attendance of the poor, and to leave out
   none of the lowest dregs of the people. By these words Christ declares
   that he would rake together all the offscourings of the world, rather
   than he would ever admit such ungrateful persons to his table. The
   allusion appears to be to the manner in which the Gospel invites us;
   for the grace of God is not merely offered to us, but doctrine is
   accompanied by exhortations fitted to arouse our minds. This is a
   display of the astonishing goodness of God, who, after freely inviting
   us, and perceiving that we give ourselves up to sleep, addresses our
   slothfulness by earnest entreaties, and not only arouses us by
   exhortations, but even compels us by threatenings to draw near to him.
   At the same time, I do not disapprove of the use which Augustine
   frequently made of this passage against the Donatists, to prove that
   godly princes may lawfully issue edicts, for compelling obstinate and
   rebellious persons to worship the true God, and to maintain the unity
   of the faith; for, though faith is voluntary, yet we see that such
   methods are useful for subduing the obstinacy of those who will not
   yield until they are compelled.

   Matthew 22:11. And the king, having come in to see the guests. Here
   Christ does not reproach the Jews with having wickedly despised the
   grace and calling of God; but gives early warning to those who would be
   placed in their room, not to pollute with their filth the holy
   marriage, when God shall bestow upon them admission to his table.
   Hitherto he has taught that the Jews, on account of their ungodly and
   disdainful conduct, would be deprived of the peculiar honor and
   privilege which they had enjoyed; and that from among the irreligious
   and abhorred Gentiles would men be called to occupy their place. But
   now he threatens that, out of this very number, those who bring
   reproach upon the Church will be expelled; for God invites all
   indiscriminately by the Gospel, and thus many unholy and abominable
   persons creep in, who, though for a time they are admitted along with
   others, yet, when God reviews the guests, will be thrown out and
   dragged to punishment. The general truth conveyed is, that not all who
   have once entered the Church will become partakers of everlasting life,
   but only those who are found to wear the dress which befits the
   heavenly palace.

   As to the wedding garment, is it faith, or is it a holy life? This is a
   useless controversy; for faith cannot be separated from good works, nor
   do good works proceed from any other source than from faith. But Christ
   intended only to state, that the Lord calls us on the express condition
   of our being renewed by the Spirit after his image; and that, in order
   to our remaining permanently in his house, we must put off the old man
   with his pollutions, (Colossians 3:9; Ephesians 4:22,) and lead a new
   life, that the garment may correspond to so honorable a calling. But a
   question arises, how comes it that a beggar is punished so severely for
   not bringing a wedding garment; as if it were unusual to see the
   wretched people, who beg their bread on the public roads, wearing
   tattered and ugly clothes? I reply, the question is not as to the
   manner in which the garment is to be procured; for whomsoever the Lord
   invites he at the same time supplies with clothing, and in all of us is
   fulfilled what Ezekiel says, (16:6-14,) that God finds nothing in us
   but wretchedness, and nakedness, and abominable filth, but adorns us
   with magnificent attire. We know also, that there is no other way in
   which we are formed anew after the image of God, but by putting on
   Christ, (Romans 13:14; Galatians 3:27.) It is not, therefore, the
   declaration of Christ, that the sentence of casting them into outer
   darkness will be executed on wretched men who did not bring a costly
   garment taken from their own wardrobe, but on those who shall be found
   in their pollution, when God shall come to make a scrutiny of his
   guests.

   14. For many are called, but few are chosen. The object of the parable
   is pointed out by the conclusion, that few are chosen, though many are
   called; from which we infer, that we ought not to attempt an ingenious
   explanation of every minute clause. But lately, Christ did not threaten
   that the greater part would be thrown out, but mentioned one man only;
   and now we learn from him, that out of a large number few will be
   retained. And certainly, though in the present day a more numerous body
   of men is collected into the Church by the Gospel than was formerly
   collected by the Law, it is but a small portion of them whose faith is
   evinced by newness of life. Let us not flatter ourselves with the empty
   title of faith, but let every man seriously examine himself, that at
   the final review he may be pronounced to be one of the lawful guests;
   for, as Paul reminds us, that the vessels in the Lord's house are not
   all of the same kind, so

   let every one that calleth on the name of the Lord
   depart from iniquity, (2 Timothy 2:19,20.)

   I enter no farther, at present, into the question about the eternal
   election of God; for the words of Christ mean nothing more than this,
   that the external profession of faith is not a sufficient proof that
   God will acknowledge as his people all who appear to have accepted of
   his invitation. [293]

   Luke 16:1-15

   Luke 16:1-15

   1. And he said also to his disciples, There was a certain rich man who
   had a steward, and he was accused to him that he was wasting his
   estate. 2. And he called him, and said to him, What is this that I hear
   of thee? render an account of thy stewardship, for thou shalt no longer
   have it in thy power to be steward. 3. And the steward said within
   himself, What shall I do, since my master taketh from me my
   stewardship? I cannot dig, and am ashamed to beg. 4. I know what I
   shall do, that, when I shall be dismissed from the stewardship, they
   may receive me [294] into their houses. 5. Having therefore sent for
   each of his master's debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou
   to my master? 6. And he said, A hundred baths of oil. And he said to
   him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. [295]
   7. Then he said to another, And how much owest thou? Who said, A
   hundred measures of barley. He saith to him, Take thy bill, and write
   eighty. 8. And the master commended the unjust steward, because he had
   acted prudently; for the children of this world are more prudent in
   their generation than the children of light. 9. And I say to you, Make
   to yourselves friends of the unjust mammon, that, when you shall fail,
   they may receive you into eternal habitations. 10. He that is faithful
   in that which is least is faithful also in much; and he that is unjust
   in that which is least is unjust also in much. 11. If therefore you
   have not been faithful in the unjust mammon, who shall entrust to you
   what is true? [296] 12. And if you have not been faithful in what
   belongs to another, who will give you what is your own? -- (A little
   after.) 14. And the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard all these
   things, and they ridiculed him. 15. And he said to them, It is you
   that, justify yourselves in the sight of men: but God knoweth your
   hearts; for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in
   the sight of God.



   The leading object of this parable is, to show that we ought to deal
   kindly and generously with our neighbors; that, when we come to the
   judgment seat of God, we may reap the fruit of our liberality. Though
   the parable appears to be harsh and far-fetched, yet the conclusion
   makes it evident, that the design of Christ was nothing else than what
   I have stated. And hence we see, that to inquire with great exactness
   into every minute part of a parable is an absurd mode of
   philosophizing. Christ does not advise us to purchase by large
   donations the forgiveness of fraud, and of extortion, and of wasteful
   expenditure, and of the other crimes associated with unfaithful
   administration. But as all the blessings which God confers upon us are
   committed by Him to our administration, our Lord now lays down a method
   of procedure, which will protect us against being treated with rigor,
   when we come to render our account.

   They who imagine that alms are a sufficient compensation for sensuality
   and debauchery, do not sufficiently consider, that the first injunction
   given us is, to live in sobriety and temperance; and that the next is,
   that the streams which flow to us come from a pure fountain. It is
   certain that no man is so frugal, as not sometimes to waste the
   property which has been entrusted to him; and that even those who
   practice the most rigid economy are not entirely free from the charge
   of unfaithful stewardship. Add to this, that there are so many ways of
   abusing the gifts of God, that some incur guilt in one way, and some in
   another. I do not even deny, that the very consciousness of our own
   faulty stewardship ought to be felt by us as an additional excitement
   to kind actions.

   But we ought to have quite another object in view, than to escape the
   judgment of God by paying a price for our redemption; and that object
   is, first, that seasonable and well-judged liberality may have the
   effect of restraining and moderating unnecessary expenses; and,
   secondly, that our kindness to our brethren may draw down upon us the
   mercy of God. It is very far from being the intention of Christ to
   point out to his disciples a way of escape, when the heavenly Judge
   shall require them to give their account; but he warns them to lose no
   time in guarding against the punishment which will await their cruelty,
   if they are found to have swallowed up the gifts of God, and to have
   paid no attention to acts of beneficence. [297] We must always attend
   to this maxim, that

   with what measure a man measures, it shall be recompensed to him again,
   (Matthew 7:2.)

   8. And the master commended the unjust steward Here it is obvious that
   if we were to attempt to find a meaning for every minute circumstance,
   we would act absurdly. To make donations out of what belongs to another
   man, is an action which is very far from deserving applause; and who
   would patiently endure that an unprincipled villain should rob him of
   his property, and give it away according to his own fancy? It were
   indeed the grossest stupidity, if that man who beheld a portion of his
   substance taken away, should commend the person who stole the remainder
   of it and bestowed it on others. But Christ only meant what he adds a
   little afterwards, that ungodly and worldly men are more industrious
   and skillful in conducting the affairs of this fading life, than the
   children of God are anxious to obtain the heavenly and eternal life, or
   careful to make it the subject of their study and meditation.

   By this comparison he charges us with highly criminal indifference, in
   not providing for the future, with at least as much earnestness as
   ungodly men display by attending to their own interests in this world.
   How disgraceful is it that the children of light, whom God enlightens
   by his Spirit and word, should slumber and neglect the hope of eternal
   blessedness held out to them, while worldly men are so eagerly bent on
   their own accommodations, and so provident and sagacious! Hence we
   infer, that our Lord does not intend to compare the wisdom of the
   Spirit to the wisdom of the flesh, (which could not have been done
   without pouring contempt on God himself,) but only to arouse believers
   to consider more attentively what belongs to the future life, and not
   to shut their eyes against the light of the Gospel, when they perceive
   that even the blind, amidst their darkness, see more clearly. And,
   indeed, the children of light ought to be more powerfully excited, when
   they behold the children of this world making provision against a
   distant period, for a life which is fading, and which passes in a
   moment.

   9. Make to yourselves friends. As in the words which were last
   considered Christ did not enjoin us to offer sacrifices to God out of
   the fruits of extortion, so now he does not mean that we ought to
   search for defenders or advocates, who will throw around us the shield
   of their protection; but teaches us that by acts of charity we obtain
   favor with God, who has promised, that to the merciful he will show
   himself merciful, (Psalm 18:25.) It is highly foolish and absurd to
   infer from this passage, that the prayers or approbation of the dead
   are of service to us: for, on that supposition, all that is bestowed on
   unworthy persons would be thrown away; but the depravity of men does
   not prevent the Lord from placing on his records all that we have
   expended on the poor. The Lord looks not to the persons, but to the
   work itself, so that our liberality, though it may happen to be
   exercised towards ungrateful men, will be of avail to us in the sight
   of God. But then he appears to intimate that eternal life depends on
   our merits. I reply: it is sufficiently plain from the context that he
   speaks after the manner of men. One who possesses extensive influence
   or wealth, if he procure friends during his prosperity, has persons who
   will support him when he is visited by adversity. In like manner, our
   kindness to the poor will be a seasonable relief to us; for whatever
   any man may have generously bestowed on his neighbors the Lord
   acknowledges as if it had been done to himself.

   When you fail. By this word he expresses the time of death, and reminds
   us that the time of our administration will be short, lest the
   confident expectation of a longer continuance of life should make us
   take a firmer grasp. The greater part are sunk in slumber through their
   wealth; many squander what they have on superfluities; while the
   niggardliness of others keeps it back, and deprives both themselves and
   others of the benefit. Whence comes all this, but because they are led
   astray by an unfounded expectation of long life, and give themselves up
   to every kind of indulgence?

   Of the mammon of unrighteousness. By giving this name to riches, he
   intends to render them an object of our suspicion, because for the most
   part they involve their possessors in unrighteousness Though in
   themselves they are not evil, yet as it rarely happens that they are
   obtained without deceit, or violence, or some other unlawful expedient,
   or that the enjoyment of them is unaccompanied by pride, or luxury, or
   some other wicked disposition, Christ justly represents them as worthy
   of our suspicion; just as on another occasion he called them thorns,
   (Matthew 13:7,22.) It would appear that a contrast, though not
   expressed, is intended to be supplied, to this effect; that riches,
   which otherwise, in consequence of wicked abuse, polluted their
   possessors, and are almost in every ease allurements of sin, ought to
   be directed to a contrary object, to be the means of procuring favor
   for us. Let us also remember what I have formerly stated, that God does
   not demand sacrifice to be made from booty unjustly acquired, as if he
   were the partner of thieves, and that it is rather a warning given to
   believers to keep themselves free from unrighteousness

   10. He who is faithful in that which is least. Those maxims are
   proverbs taken from ordinary practice and experience, and it is quite
   enough if they are generally true. It will sometimes happen, no doubt,
   that a deceiver, who had disregarded a small gain, shall display his
   wickedness in a matter of importance. Nay, many persons, by affecting
   honesty in trifling matters, are only in pursuit of an enormous gain;
   [298] as that author [299] says: "Fraud establishes confidence in
   itself in small matters, that, when a fit opportunity shall arrive, it
   may deceive with vast advantage." And yet the statement of Christ is
   not inaccurate; for in proverbs, as I have mentioned, we attend only to
   what usually happens.

   Christ, therefore, exhorts his disciples to act faithfully in small
   matters, in order to prepare themselves for the exercise of fidelity in
   matters of the highest importance. He next applies this doctrine to the
   proper stewardship of spiritual graces, which the world, indeed, does
   not estimate according to their value, but which far surpass, beyond
   all question, the fading riches of this world. Those persons, he tells
   us, who act improperly and unfaithfully in things of small value, such
   as the transitory riches of the world, do not deserve that God should
   entrust to them the inestimable treasure of the Gospel, and of similar
   gifts. There is, therefore, in these words an implied threatening, that
   there is reason to fear lest, on account of our abuse of an earthly
   stewardship, we fail to obtain heavenly gifts. In this sense, what is
   true is contrasted with riches, as what is solid and lasting is
   contrasted with what is shadowy and fading. [300]

   12. And if you have not been faithful in what belongs to another. By
   the expression, what belongs to another, he means what is not within
   man; for God does not bestow riches upon us on condition that we shall
   be attached to them, but makes us stewards of them in such a manner,
   that they may not bind us with their chains. And, indeed, it is
   impossible that our minds should be free and disengaged for dwelling in
   heaven, if we did not look upon every thing that is in the world as
   belonging to another

   Who shall entrust to you what is your own? Spiritual riches, on the
   other hand, which relate to a future life, are pronounced by him to be
   our own, because the enjoyment of them is everlasting. But now he
   employs a different comparison. There is no reason, he tells us, to
   expect that we shall make a proper and moderate use of our own
   property, if we have acted improperly or unfaithfully in what belonged
   to another. Men usually care less about abusing, and allow themselves
   greater liberty in squandering, their own property, because they are
   not afraid that any person will find fault with them; but when a thing
   has been entrusted to them either in charge or in loan, and of which
   they must afterwards render an account, they are more cautious and more
   timid.

   We thus ascertain Christ's meaning to be, that they who are bad
   stewards of earthly blessings would not be faithful guardians of
   spiritual gifts. He next introduces a sentence: You cannot serve God
   and mammon; which I have explained at Matthew 6:24. There the reader
   will find an explanation of the word Mammon [301]

   14. And the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard all these things. They
   who imagine that Christ was ridiculed by the Pharisees, because he
   chose to employ a plain and familiar style, and made no use of swelling
   words, [302] do not sufficiently comprehend what Luke means. Haughty
   and disdainful men, I do acknowledge, view the doctrine of the Gospel
   with contempt; but Luke expressly declares the reason why Christ was
   the object of their derision to have been, that they were covetous
   Entertaining a firm and deep-seated conviction that the rich are happy,
   and that there is nothing better for men than to increase their wealth
   by every possible method, and earnestly to guard whatever they have
   acquired, they reject as foolish paradoxes [303] all the sayings of
   Christ which had a contrary tendency. And, certainly, any one that
   speaks of despising riches, or bestowing alms on the poor, is regarded
   by the covetous as a madman. Horace's words on this subject are well
   known: [304] "The people hiss at me, but I am well satisfied with
   myself." [305] But if, even when they are condemned by universal
   opinion, they continue to flatter themselves, how much more will they
   ridicule as a fable that philosophy of Christ which is far removed from
   the ordinary belief?

   Some other pretense, I have no doubt, was held out by the Pharisees for
   ridiculing and evading a doctrine which opposed their vice. But we must
   attend to the motive by which they were actuated; for it is a disease
   which almost always prevails in the world, that the greater part of men
   affect to despise whatever does not fall in with their corrupt morals.
   Hence the ridicule, and jest, and merriment, with which the word of God
   is frequently assailed; for every man fights in defense of his own
   vices, and all imagine that their witticisms will serve for a cloud to
   screen their criminality.

   15. It is you that justify yourselves before men. We see that Christ
   does not give way to their disdainful conduct, but constantly maintains
   the authority of his doctrine in opposition to their mockery; and it is
   the duty of all the ministers of the Gospel to pursue the same course,
   by meeting ungodly despisers with the dreadful judgment of God. He
   declares that the hypocrisy, with which they deceive the eyes of men,
   will be of no avail to them at the judgment-seat of God. They were
   unwilling to have it thought that their mockery was intended as a
   defense of their covetousness. But Christ affirms that this venom
   breaks out from a concealed ulcer; just as if one were to tell the
   mitred prelates of our own day, that their hostility to the Gospel
   arises from the severity with which it attacks their hidden vices.

   But God knoweth your hearts. He says that they reckon it enough if they
   appear to be good in the eyes of men, and if they can boast of a
   pretended sanctity; but that God, who knoweth the hearts, is well
   acquainted with the vices which they conceal from the view of the
   world. And here we must attend to the distinction between the judgments
   of God and the judgments of men; for men bestow approbation on outward
   appearances, but at the judgment-seat of God nothing is approved but an
   upright heart. There is added a striking observation:

   What is highly esteemed by men is abomination in the sight of God. Not
   that God rejects those virtues, the approbation of which He hath
   engraved on the hearts of men; but that God detests whatever men are
   disposed, of their own accord, to applaud. Hence it is evident in what
   light we ought to view all pretended acts of worship which the world
   contrives according to its own fancy. How much soever they may please
   their inventors, Christ pronounces that they are not only vain and
   worthless, but are even detestable.

   Luke 16:19-31

   Luke 16:19-31

   19. There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine
   linen, [306] and feasted sumptuously every day: 20. And there was a
   certain beggar, named Lazarus, who lay at his gate, full of sores,
   21. And desiring to be fed from the crumbs which fell from the rich
   man's table: and even the dogs came and licked his sores. 22. And it
   happened that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into
   Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; 23. And,
   lifting up his eyes in hell, when he was in torments, he seeth Abraham
   afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. 24. And he, crying out, said,
   Father Abraham, have compassion on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip
   of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this
   flame. 25. And Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
   receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus likewise evil things: but now
   he enjoys comfort, and thou art tormented. 26. And besides all these
   things, a vast gulf lieth between us and you; so that they who wish to
   pass hence to you cannot, nor can they pass to us thence. 27. And he
   said, I beseech thee, therefore, father, to send him to my father's
   house: 28. For I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, lest
   they also come into this place of torment. 29. Abraham saith to him,
   They have Moses and the prophets: let them hear them. 30. But he said,
   Nay, father Abraham; but if one went to them from the dead, they will
   repent. 31. And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the
   prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead.



   Though Luke introduces some things between them, there can be no doubt
   that this example was intended by Christ to confirm the discourse which
   we have last examined. He points out what condition awaits those [307]
   who neglect the care of the poor, and indulge in all manner of
   gluttony; who give themselves up to drunkenness and other pleasures,
   and allow their neighbors to pine with hunger; nay, who cruelly kill
   with famine those whom they ought to have relieved, when the means of
   doing so were in their power. Some look upon it as a simple parable;
   but, as the name Lazarus occurs in it, I rather consider it to be the
   narrative of an actual fact. But that is of little consequence,
   provided that the reader comprehends the doctrine which it contains.

   19. There was a certain rich man He is, first of all, described as
   clothed in purple and fine linen, and enjoying every day splendor and
   luxury. This denotes a life spent amidst delicacies, and superfluity,
   and pomp. Not that all elegance and ornaments of dress are in
   themselves displeasing to God, or that all the care bestowed on
   preparing victuals ought to be condemned; but because it seldom happens
   that such things are kept in moderation. He who has a liking for fine
   dress will constantly increase his luxury by fresh additions; and it is
   scarcely possible that he who indulges in sumptuous and well garnished
   tables shall avoid falling into intemperance. But the chief accusation
   brought against this man is his cruelty in suffering Lazarus, poor and
   full of sores, to lie out of doors at his gate.

   These two clauses Christ has exhibited in contrast. The rich man,
   devoted to the pleasures of the table and to display, swallowed up,
   like an unsatiable gulf, his enormous wealth, but remained unmoved by
   the poverty and distresses of Lazarus, and knowingly and willingly
   suffered him to pine away with hunger, cold, and the offensive smell of
   his sores. In this manner Ezekiel (16:49) accuses Sodom of not
   stretching out her hand to the poor amidst fullness of bread and wine.
   The fine linen, which is a peculiarly delicate fabric, is well-known to
   have been used by the inhabitants of eastern countries for elegance and
   splendor; a fashion which the Popish priests have imitated in what they
   call their surplices.

   21. And even the dogs came. It was quite enough to prove the hardened
   cruelty of the rich man, that the sight of wretchedness like this did
   not move him to compassion. Had there been a drop of humanity in him,
   he ought at least to have ordered a supply from his kitchen for the
   unhappy man. But the crowning exhibition of his wicked, and savage, and
   worse than brutal disposition was, that he did not learn pity even from
   the dogs There can be no doubt that those dogs were guided by the
   secret purpose of God, to condemn that man by their example. Christ
   certainly produces them here as witnesses to convict him of unfeeling
   and detestable cruelty. What could be more monstrous than to see the
   dogs taking charge of a man, to whom his neighbor is paying no
   attention; and, what is more, to see the very crumbs of bread refused
   to a man perishing of hunger, while the dogs are giving him the service
   of their tongues for the purpose of healing his sores? When strangers,
   or even brute animals, supply our place, by performing an office which
   ought rather to have been discharged by ourselves, let us conclude that
   they are so many witnesses and judges appointed by God, to make our
   criminality the more manifest.

   22. And it happened that the beggar died. Christ here points out the
   vast change which death effected in the condition of the two men. Death
   was no doubt common to both; but to be after death carried by angels
   into Abraham's bosom was a happiness more desirable than all the
   kingdoms of the world. On the other hand, to be sentenced to
   everlasting torments is a dreadful thing, for avoiding which a hundred
   lives, if it were possible, ought to be employed. In the person of
   Lazarus there is held out to us a striking proof that we ought not to
   pronounce men to be accursed by God, because they drag out, in
   incessant pain, a life which is full of distresses. In him the grace of
   God was so entirely hidden, and buried by the deformity and shame of
   the cross, that to the eye of the flesh nothing presented itself except
   the curse; and yet we see that in a body which was loathsome and full
   of rottenness there was lodged a soul unspeakably precious, which is
   carried by angels to a blessed life. It was no loss to him that he was
   forsaken, and despised, and destitute of every human comfort, when
   heavenly spirits deign to accompany him on his removal from the prison
   of the flesh.

   And the rich man also died, and was buried. In the rich man we see, as
   in a bright mirror, how undesirable is that temporal happiness which
   ends in everlasting destruction. It deserves our attention, that Christ
   expressly mentions the burial of the rich man, but says nothing of what
   was done to Lazarus. Not that his dead body was exposed to wild beasts,
   or lay in the open air, but because it was thrown carelessly, and
   without the slightest attention, into a ditch; for it may naturally be
   inferred from the corresponding clause, that no more attention was paid
   to him when he was dead than when he was alive. The rich man, on the
   other hand, buried magnificently according to his wealth, still retains
   some remnant of his former pride. [308] In this respect, we see ungodly
   men striving, as it were, against nature, by affecting a pompous and
   splendid funeral for the sake of preserving their superiority after
   death; but their souls in hell attest the folly and mockery of this
   ambition.

   And Lazarus was carried by angels. When he says that Lazarus was
   carried, it is a figure of speech by which a part is taken for the
   whole; for the soul being the nobler part of man, properly takes the
   name of the whole man. [309] This office is, not without reason,
   assigned by Christ to angels, who, we are aware, have been appointed to
   be ministering spirits (Hebrews 1:14) to believers, that they may
   devote their care and labor to their salvation.

   Into Abraham's bosom. To detail the variety of speculations about
   Abraham's bosom, in which many commentators of Scripture have indulged,
   is unnecessary, and, in my opinion, would serve no good purpose. It is
   quite enough that we receive what readers well acquainted with
   Scripture will acknowledge to be the natural meaning. As Abraham is
   called the father of believers, because to him was committed the
   covenant of eternal life, that he might first preserve it faithfully
   for his own children, and afterwards transmit it to all nations, and as
   all who are heirs of the same promise are called his children; so those
   who receive along with him the fruit of the same faith are said, after
   death, to be collected into his bosom. The metaphor is taken from a
   father [310] , in whose bosom, as it were, the children meet, when they
   all return home in the evening from the labors of the day. The children
   of God are scattered during their pilgrimage in this world; but as, in
   their present course, they follow the faith of their father Abraham, so
   they are received at death into that blessed rest, in which he awaits
   their arrival. It is not necessary to suppose that reference is made
   here to any one place; but the assemblage of which I have spoken is
   described, for the purpose of assuring believers, that they have not
   been fruitlessly employed in fighting for the faith under the banner of
   Abraham, for they enjoy the same habitation in heaven.

   It will perhaps be asked, Is the same condition reserved after death
   for the godly of our own day, or did Christ, when he rose, open his
   bosom to admit Abraham himself, as well as all the godly? I reply
   briefly: As the grace of God is more clearly revealed to us in the
   Gospel, and as Christ himself, the Sun of Righteousness, (Malachi 4:2,)
   has brought to us that salvation, which the fathers were formerly
   permitted to behold at a distance and under dark shadows, so there
   cannot be a doubt that believers, when they die, make a nearer approach
   to the enjoyment of the heavenly life. Still, it must be understood,
   that the glory of immortality is delayed till the last day of
   redemption. So far as relates to the word bosom, that quiet harbor at
   which believers arrive after the navigation of the present life, may be
   called either Abraham's bosom or Christ's bosom; but, as we have
   advanced farther than the fathers did under the Law, this distinction
   will be more properly expressed by saying, that the members of Christ
   are associated with their Head; and thus there will be an end of the
   metaphor about Abraham's bosom, as the brightness of the sun, when he
   is risen, makes all the stars to disappear. From the mode of expression
   which Christ has here employed, we may, in the meantime, draw the
   inference, that the fathers under the Law embraced by faith, while they
   lived, that inheritance of the heavenly life into which they were
   admitted at death.

   23. And, lifting up, his eyes in hell. Though Christ is relating a
   history, yet he describes spiritual things under figures, which he knew
   to be adapted to our senses. Souls have neither fingers nor eyes, and
   are not liable to thirst, nor do they hold such conversations among
   themselves as are here described to have taken place between Abraham
   and the rich man; but our Lord has here drawn a picture, which
   represents the condition of the life to come according to the measure
   of our capacity. The general truth conveyed is, that believing souls,
   when they have left their bodies, lead a joyful and blessed life out of
   this world, and that for the reprobate there are prepared dreadful
   torments, which can no more be conceived by our minds than the
   boundless glory of the heavens. As it is only in a small measure--only
   so far as we are enlightened by the Spirit of God--that we taste by
   hope the glory promised to us, which far exceeds all our senses, let it
   be reckoned enough that the inconceivable vengeance of God, which
   awaits the ungodly, is communicated to us in an obscure manner, so far
   as is necessary to strike terror into our minds.

   On these subjects the words of Christ give us slender information, and
   in a manner which is fitted to restrain curiosity. The wicked are
   described as fearfully tormented by the misery which they feel; as
   desiring some relief, but cut off from hope, and thus experiencing a
   double torment; and as having their anguish increased by being
   compelled to remember their crimes, and to compare the present
   blessedness of believers with their own miserable and lost condition.
   In connection with this a conversation is related, as if persons who
   have no intercourse with each other were supposed to talk together.
   When the rich man says, Father Abraham, this expresses an additional
   torment, that he perceives, when it is too late, that he is cut off
   from the number of the children of Abraham

   25. Son, remember. The word son appears to be used ironically, as a
   sharp and piercing reproof to the rich man, who falsely boasted in his
   lifetime that he was one of the sons of Abraham. It seems as if pain
   inflicted by a hot iron wounded his mind, when his hypocrisy and false
   confidence are placed before his eyes. When it is said that he is
   tormented in hell, because he had received his good things in his
   lifetime, we must not understand the meaning to be, that eternal
   destruction awaits all who have enjoyed prosperity in the world. On the
   contrary, as Augustine has judiciously observed, poor Lazarus was
   carried into the bosom of rich Abraham, to inform us, that riches do
   not shut against any man the gate of the kingdom of heaven, but that it
   is open alike to all who have either made a sober use of riches, or
   patiently endured the want of them. All that is meant is, that the rich
   man, who yielded to the allurements of the present life, abandoned
   himself entirely to earthly enjoyments, and despised God and His
   kingdom, now suffers the punishment of his own neglect.

   Receivedst THY good things. The pronoun thy is emphatic, as if Abraham
   had said: Thou wast created for an immortal life, and the Law of God
   raised time on high to the contemplation of the heavenly life; but
   thou, forgetting so exalted a condition, didst choose to resemble a sow
   or a dog, and thou therefore receivest a reward which befits brutal
   pleasures. But now he enjoys comfort When it is said of Lazarus, on the
   other hand, that he enjoys comfort, because he had suffered many
   distresses in the world, it would be idle to apply this to all whose
   condition is wretched; because their afflictions, in many cases, are so
   far from having been of service to them, that they ought rather to
   bring upon them severer punishment. But Lazarus is commended for
   patient endurance of the cross, which always springs from faith and a
   genuine fear of God; for he who obstinately resists his sufferings, and
   whose ferocity remains unsubdued, has no claim to be rewarded for
   patience, by receiving from God comfort in exchange for the cross.

   To sum up the whole, they who have patiently endured the burden of the
   cross laid upon them, and have not been rebellious against the yoke and
   chastisements of God, but, amidst uninterrupted sufferings, have
   cherished the hope of a better life, have a rest laid up for them in
   heaven, when the period of their warfare shall be terminated. On the
   contrary, wicked despisers of God, who are wholly engrossed in the
   pleasures of the flesh, and who by a sort of mental intoxication, drown
   every feeling of piety, will experience, immediately after death, such
   torments as will efface their empty enjoyments. It must also be
   recollected, that this comfort, which the sons of God enjoy, lies in
   this, that they perceive a crown of glory prepared for them, and rest
   in the joyful expectation of it; as, on the other hand, the wicked are
   tormented by the apprehension of the future judgment, which they see
   coming upon them.

   26. A vast gulf lieth. These words describe the permanency of the
   future state, and denote, that the boundaries which separate the
   reprobate from the elect can never be broken through. And thus we are
   reminded to return early to the path, while there is yet time, lest we
   rush headlong into that abyss, from which it will be impossible to
   rise. The words must not be strictly interpreted, when it is said, that
   no one is permitted to pass who would wish to descend from heaven to
   hell; for it is certain, that none of the righteous entertain any such
   desire.

   27. I beseech thee, father. To bring the narrative into more full
   accordance with our modes of thinking, he describes the rich man as
   wishing that his brothers, who were still alive, should be warned by
   Lazarus. Here the Papists exercise their ingenuity very foolishly, by
   attempting to prove that the dead feel solicitude about the living. Any
   thing more ridiculous than this sophistry cannot be conceived; for with
   equal plausibility I might undertake to prove, that believing souls are
   not satisfied with the place assigned to them, and are actuated by a
   desire of removing from it to hell, were it not that they are prevented
   by a vast gulf. If no man holds such extravagant views, the Papists are
   not entitled to congratulate themselves on the other supposition. It is
   not my intention, however, to debate the point, or to defend either one
   side or another; but I thought it right to advert, in passing, to the
   futility of the arguments on which they rest their belief that the dead
   intercede with God on our behalf. I now return to the plain and natural
   meaning of this passage.

   29. They have Moses and the prophets. In the persons of the rich man
   and Abraham Christ reminds us, that we have received an undoubted rule
   of life, and that therefore we have no right to expect that the dead
   will rise to instruct and persuade us. Moses and the prophets were
   appointed to instruct, while they lived, the men of their own age; but
   it was with the design, that the same advantage should be derived by
   posterity from their writings. As it is the will of God that we should
   receive instructions, in this manner, about a holy life, there is no
   reason why the dead should assure us of the rewards and punishments of
   the future state; nor is there any excuse for the indifference of those
   who shelter themselves under the pretext, that they do not know what is
   going on beyond this world. Among irreligious men, we are aware, is
   frequently heard this wicked saying, or rather this grunting of hogs,
   that it is foolish in men to distress themselves with fears about a
   matter of uncertainty, since no one has ever returned to bring us
   tidings about hell.

   With the view of counteracting every enchantment of Satan of this
   description, Christ draws their attention to the Law and the Prophets,
   agreeably to that passage in the writings of Moses:

   It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to
   heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? Neither
   is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the
   sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? But
   the word is very nigh unto thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart,
   that thou shouldest do it,
   (Deuteronomy 30:12-14.)

   They who ridicule as fabulous what Scripture testifies as to the future
   judgment, will one day feel how shocking is the wickedness of giving
   the lie to the holy oracles of God. From such lethargy Christ arouses
   his followers, that they may not be deceived by the hope of escaping
   punishment, and thus fail to improve the time allowed for repentance.

   Abraham's reply amounts to this: By Moses and the prophets God had
   sufficiently made known to his people the doctrine of salvation, and
   nothing remains for us but that it obtain the assent of all. So
   thoroughly infected is the mind of man with a depraved curiosity, that
   the greater part of men are always gaping after new revelations. Now as
   nothing is more displeasing to God than when men are so eager to go
   beyond due bounds, he forbids them to inquire at magicians and
   soothsayers respecting the truth, and to consult pretended oracles
   after the manner of the Gentiles; and in order to restrain that itching
   curiosity, he promises, at the same time, that he will give prophets,
   from whom the people may learn whatever is necessary to be known for
   salvation, (Deuteronomy 18:9,15.) But if the prophets were sent for the
   express purpose; that God might keep his people under the guidance of
   his word, he who is not satisfied with this method of instruction is
   not actuated by a desire to learn, but tickled by ungodly wantonness;
   and therefore God complains that He is insulted, when He alone is not
   heard from the living to the dead, (Isaiah 8:19.)

   The division of the word of God, which Abraham makes, into the Law and
   the Prophets, refers to the time of the Old Testament. Now that the
   more ample explanation of the Gospel has been added, there is still
   less excuse for our wickedness, if our dislike of that doctrine hurries
   us in every possible direction, and, in a word, if we do not permit
   ourselves to be regulated by the word of God. Hence too we infer how
   solid is the faith of Papists about purgatory and such fooleries, when
   it rests on nothing but phantoms. [311]

   30. Nay, father Abraham. This is a personification, as we have said,
   which expresses rather the feelings of the living than the anxiety of
   the dead. The doctrine of the Law is little esteemed by the world, the
   Prophets are neglected, and no man submits to hear God speaking in his
   own manner. Some would desire that angels should descend from heaven;
   others, that the dead should come out of their graves; others, that new
   miracles should be performed every day to sanction what they hear; and
   others, that voices should be heard from the sky. [312] But if God were
   pleased to comply with all their foolish wishes, it would be of no
   advantage to them; for God has included in his word all that is
   necessary to be known, and the authority of this word has been attested
   and proved by authentic seals. Besides, faith does not depend on
   miracles, or any extraordinary sign, but is the peculiar gift of the
   Spirit, and is produced by means of the word. Lastly, it is the
   prerogative of God to draw us to himself, and he is pleased to work
   effectually through his own word. There is not the slightest reason,
   therefore, to expect that those means, which withdraw us from obedience
   to the word, will be of any service to us. I freely acknowledge, that
   there is nothing to which the flesh is more strongly inclined than to
   listen to vain revelations; and we see how eagerly those men, to whom
   the whole of Scripture is an object of dislike, throw themselves into
   the snares of Satan. Hence have arisen necromancy and other delusions,
   which the world not only receives with avidity, but runs after with
   furious rage. But all that is here affirmed by Christ is, that even the
   dead could not reform, [313] or bring to a sound mind, those who are
   deaf and obstinate against the instructions of the law.

   Luke 17:7-10

   Luke 17:7-10

   7. But which of you that hath a servant ploughing or feeding, when he
   hath returned from the field, will immediately say to him, Come [314]
   and sit down at table? 8. And doth not rather say to him, Prepare
   supper for me, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and
   drunk, and, after that, eat and drink thou. [315] 9. Doth he thank that
   servant, [316] because he did the things which were commanded him? I
   suppose not. 10. So likewise, when you shall have done those things
   which were commanded you, do you say, We are unprofitable servants: we
   have done what we were bound to do.


   The object of this parable is to show that God claims all that belongs
   to us as his property, and possesses an entire control over our persons
   and services; and, therefore, that all the zeal that may be manifested
   by us in discharging our duty does not lay him under obligation to us
   by any sort of merit; for, as we are his property, so he on his part
   can owe us nothing. [317] He adduces the comparison of a servant, who,
   after having spent the day in severe toil, returns home in the evening,
   and continues his labors till his master is pleased to relieve him.
   [318] Christ speaks not of such servants as we have in the present day,
   who work for hire, but of the slaves that lived in ancient times, whose
   condition in society was such, that they gained nothing for themselves,
   but all that belonged to them--their toil, and application, and
   industry, even to their very blood--was the property of their masters.
   Christ now shows that a bond of servitude not less rigorous binds and
   obliges us to serve God; from which he infers, that we have no means of
   laying Him under obligations to us.

   It is an argument drawn from the less to the greater; for if a mortal
   man is permitted to hold such power over another man, as to enjoin upon
   him uninterrupted services by night and by day, and yet contract no
   sort of mutual obligation, as if he were that man's debtor, how much
   more shall God have a right to demand the services of our whole life,
   to the utmost extent that our ability allows, and yet be in no degree
   indebted to us? We see then that all are held guilty of wicked
   arrogance who imagine that they deserve any thing from God, or that he
   is bound to them in any way. And yet no crime is more generally
   practiced than this kind of arrogance; for there is no man that would
   not willingly call God to account, and hence the notion of merits has
   prevailed in almost every age.

   But we must attend more closely to the statement made by Christ, that
   we render nothing to God beyond what he has a right to claim, but are
   so strongly bound to his service, that we owe him every thing that lies
   in our power. It consists of two clauses. First, our life, even to the
   very end of our course, belongs entirely to God; so that, if a person
   were to spend a part of it in obedience to God, he would have no right
   to bargain that he should rest for the remainder of the time; as a
   considerable number of men, after serving as soldiers for ten years,
   would gladly apply for a discharge. Then follows the second clause, on
   which we have already touched, that God is not bound to pay us hire for
   any of our services. Let each of us remember, that he has been created
   by God for the purpose of laboring, and of being vigorously employed in
   his work; and that not only for a limited time, but till death itself,
   and, what is more, that he shall not only live, but die, to God,
   (Romans 14:8.)

   With respect to merit, we must remove the difficulty by which many are
   perplexed; for Scripture so frequently promises a reward to our works,
   that they think it allows them some merit. The reply is easy. A reward
   is promised, not as a debt, but from the mere good pleasure of God. It
   is a great mistake to suppose that there is a mutual relation between
   Reward and Merit; for it is by his own undeserved favor, and not by the
   value of our works, that God is induced to reward them. By the
   engagements of the Law [319] , I readily acknowledge, God is bound to
   men, if they were to discharge fully all that is required from them;
   but still, as this is a voluntary obligation, it remains a fixed
   principle, that man can demand nothing from God, as if he had merited
   any thing. And thus the arrogance of the flesh falls to the ground;
   for, granting that any man fulfilled the Law, he cannot plead that he
   has any claims on God, having done no more than he was bound to do.
   When he says that we are unprofitable servants, his meaning is, that
   God receives from us nothing beyond what is justly due but only
   collects the lawful revenues of his dominion.

   There are two principles, therefore, that must be maintained: first,
   that God naturally owes us nothing, and that all the services which we
   render to him are not worth a single straw; secondly, that, according
   to the engagements of the Law, a reward is attached to works, not on
   account of their value, but because God is graciously pleased to become
   our debtor. [320] It would evince intolerable ingratitude, if on such a
   ground any person should indulge in proud vaunting. The kindness and
   liberality which God exercises towards us are so far from giving us a
   right to swell with foolish confidence, that we are only laid under
   deeper obligations to Him. Whenever we meet with the word reward, or
   whenever it occurs to our recollection, let us look upon this as the
   crowning act of the goodness of God to us, that, though we are
   completely in his debt, he condescends to enter into a bargain with us.
   So much the more detestable is the invention of the Sophists, who have
   had the effrontery to forge a kind of merit, which professes to be
   founded on a just claim. [321] The word merit, taken by itself, was
   sufficiently profane and inconsistent with the standard of piety; but
   to intoxicate men with diabolical pride, as if they could merit any
   thing by a just claim, is far worse.

   10. We have done what we were bound to do. That is, "we have brought
   nothing of our own, but have only done what we were bound by the law to
   do " Christ speaks here of an entire observance of the law, which is
   nowhere to be found; for the most perfect of all men is still at a
   great distance from that righteousness which the law demands. The
   present question is not, Are we justified by works? but, Is the
   observance of the law meritorious of any reward from God? This latter
   question is answered in the negative; for God holds us for his slaves,
   and therefore reckons all that can proceed from us to be his just
   right. Nay, though it were true, that a reward is due to the observance
   of the law in respect of merit, it will not therefore follow that any
   man is justified by the merits of works; for we all fail: and not only
   is our obedience imperfect, but there is not a single part of it that
   corresponds exactly to the judgment of God.

   Luke 18:1-8

   Luke 18:1-8

   1. And he spake also a parable to them, that they ought always to pray,
   and not to grow weary: 2. Saying, There was a judge in a city, who
   neither feared God, nor regarded man. 3. And there was a widow in that
   city, who came to him, saying, Do me justice on my adversary. 4. And he
   refused for some time, [322] but afterwards said within himself, Though
   I neither fear God, nor regard man, 5. Yet because this widow is
   troublesome to me, [323] I will do her justice, lest by coming
   perpetually she weary me out. [324] 6. And the Lord said, Hear what the
   unjust judge saith. 7. And will not God avenge his elect, who cry to
   him night and day, even though he forbear with respect to them? [325]
   8. I tell you that he will speedily avenge them. But when the Son of
   man shall come, will he find faith on the earth? [326]


   We know that perseverance in prayer is a rare and difficult attainment;
   and it is a manifestation of our unbelief that, when our first prayers
   are not successful, we immediately throw away not only hope, but all
   the ardor of prayer. But it is an undoubted evidence of our Faith, if
   we are disappointed of our wish, and yet do not lose courage. Most
   properly, therefore, does Christ recommend to his disciples to
   persevere in praying.

   The parable which he employs, though apparently harsh, was admirably
   fitted to instruct his disciples, that they ought to be importunate in
   their prayers to God the Father, till they at length draw from him what
   He would otherwise appear to be unwilling to give. Not that by our
   prayers we gain a victory over God, and bend him slowly and reluctantly
   to compassion, but because the actual facts do not all at once make it
   evident that he graciously listens to our prayers. In the parable
   Christ describes to us a widow, who obtained what she wanted from an
   unjust and cruel judge, because she did not cease to make earnest
   demands. The leading truth conveyed is, that God does not all at once
   grant assistance to his people, because he chooses to be, as it were,
   wearied out by prayers; and that, however wretched and despicable may
   be the condition of those who pray to him, yet if they do not desist
   from the uninterrupted exercise of prayer, he will at length regard
   them and relieve their necessities.

   The parties between whom the comparison is drawn are, indeed, by no
   means equal; for there is a wide difference between a wicked and cruel
   man and God, who is naturally inclined to mercy. But Christ intended to
   assure believers that they have no reason to fear lest their
   persevering entreaties to the Father of mercy should be refused, since
   by importunate supplication they prevail on men who are given to
   cruelty. The wicked and iron-hearted judge could not avoid yielding at
   length, though reluctantly, to the earnest solicitations of the widow:
   how then shall the prayers of believers, when perseveringly maintained,
   be without effect? If exhaustion and weakness are felt by us when we
   give way after a slight exertion, or if the ardor of prayer languishes
   because God appears to lend a deaf ear, let us rest assured of our
   ultimate success, though it may not be immediately apparent.
   Entertaining this conviction, let us contend against our impatience, so
   that the long delay may not induce us to discontinue our prayers.

   7. And shall not God avenge his elect? That judge, whom Christ has
   described to us as altogether desperate, as not only hardened against
   the contemplation of God, but so entirely devoid of shame, that he had
   no anxiety about his reputation, at length opened his eyes to the
   distresses of the widow We have no reason to doubt that believers will
   derive, at least, equal advantage from their prayers, provided they do
   not cease to plead earnestly with God. Yet it must be observed that,
   while Christ applies the parable to his subject, he does not make God
   to resemble a wicked and cruel judge, but points out a very different
   reason why those who believe in him are kept long in suspense, and why
   he does not actually and at once stretch out his hand to them: it is
   because he forbears If at any time God winks at the injuries done to us
   longer than we would wish, let us know that this is done with a
   fatherly intention--to train us to patience. A temporary overlooking of
   crimes is very different from allowing them to remain for ever
   unpunished. The promise which he makes, that God will speedily avenge
   them, must be referred to his providence; for our hasty tempers and
   carnal apprehension lead us to conclude that he does not come quickly
   enough to grant relief. But if we could penetrate into his design, we
   would learn that his assistance is always ready and seasonable, as the
   case demands, and is not delayed for a single moment, but comes at the
   exact time.

   But it is asked, How does Christ instruct his disciples to seek
   vengeance, while he exhorts them on another occasion, pray for those
   who injure and persecute you, (Matthew 5:44.) I reply: what Christ says
   here about vengeance does not at all interfere with his former
   doctrine. God declares that he will avenge believers, not for the
   purpose of giving a loose rein to their carnal affections, but in order
   to convince them that their salvation is dear and precious in his
   sight, and in this manner to induce them to rely on his protection. If,
   laying aside hatred, pure and free from every wicked desire of revenge,
   and influenced by proper and well-regulated dispositions, they implore
   divine assistance, it will be a lawful and holy wish, and God himself
   will listen to it. But as nothing is more difficult than to divest
   ourselves of sinful affections, if we would offer pure and sincere
   prayers, we must ask the Lord to guide and direct our hearts by his
   Spirit. Then shall we lawfully call on God to be our avenger, and he
   will answer our prayers.

   8. When the Son of man shall come. By these words Christ informs us
   that there will be no reason to wonder if men shall afterwards sink
   under their calamities: it will be because they neglect the true
   remedy. He intended to obviate an offense which we are daily apt to
   take, when we see all things in shameful confusion. Treachery, cruelty,
   imposture, deceit, and violence, abound on every hand; there is no
   regard to justice, and no shame; the poor groan under their oppressors;
   the innocent are abused or insulted; while God appears to be asleep in
   heaven. This is the reason why the flesh imagines that the government
   of fortune is blind. But Christ here reminds us that men are justly
   deprived of heavenly aid, on which they have neither knowledge nor
   inclination to place reliance. They who do nothing but murmur against
   the Lord in their hearts, and who allow no place for his providence,
   cannot reasonably expect that the Lord will assist them.

   Shall he find faith on the earth? Christ expressly foretells that, from
   his ascension to heaven till his return, unbelievers will abound;
   meaning by these words that, if the Redeemer does not so speedily
   appear, the blame of the delay will attach to men, because there will
   be almost none to look for him. Would that we did not behold so
   manifest a fulfillment of this prediction! But experience proves that
   though the world is oppressed and overwhelmed by a huge mass of
   calamities, there are few indeed in whom the least spark of faith can
   be discerned. Others understand the word faith to denote uprightness,
   but the former meaning is more agreeable to the context.

   Luke 18:9-14

   Luke 18:9-14

   9. And he spoke also this parable to some who trusted in themselves
   that they were righteous, and despised others: 10. Two men went up into
   the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
   11. The Pharisee standing [327] prayed these things within himself:
   God, I thank thee that I am not as other men, extortioners, unjust,
   adulterous, or even as this publican. 12. I fast twice in the week, I
   give tithes of all that I possess. 13. And the publican standing at a
   distance, did not even wish to raise his eyes towards heaven, but smote
   upon his breast, saying, Lord, be reconciled to me a sinner. 14. I say
   to you, this man went down into his house justified rather than the
   other; for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled, and he
   that humbleth himself shall be exalted.



   Christ now gives directions about another virtue, which is necessary to
   acceptable prayer. Believers must not come into the presence of God but
   with humility and abasement. No disease is more dangerous than
   arrogance; and yet all have it so deeply fixed in the marrow of their
   bones, that it can scarcely be removed or extirpated by any remedy. It
   is no doubt strange that men should be so mad as to venture to raise
   their crests against God, and to plead their own merits before him.
   Though men are carried away by their ambition, yet when we come into
   the presence of God, all presumption ought to be laid aside; and yet
   every man thinks that he has sufficiently humbled himself, if he only
   presents a hypocritical prayer for forgiveness. Hence we infer that
   this warning which our Lord gives was far from being unnecessary.

   There are two faults at which Christ glances, and which he intended to
   condemn, -- wicked confidence in ourselves, and the pride of despising
   brethren, the one of which springs out of the other. It is impossible
   that he who deceives himself with vain confidence should not lift
   himself up above his brethren. Nor is it wonderful that it should be
   so; for how should that man not despise his equals, who vaunts against
   God himself? Every man that is puffed up with self-confidence carries
   on open war with God, to whom we cannot be reconciled in any other way
   than by denial of ourselves; that is, by laying aside all confidence in
   our own virtue and righteousness, and relying on his mercy alone.

   10. Two men went up. Christ makes a comparison between the two men,
   both of whom, by going up to pray, seem to manifest the same ardor of
   piety, while yet they are exceedingly unlike. The Pharisee, possessing
   outward sanctity, approaches to God with a commendation which he
   pronounces on his whole life, and as if he had an undoubted right to
   offer the sacrifice of praise. The publican, on the other hand, as if
   he had been some outcast, and knew that he was unworthy to approach,
   presents himself with trembling and with humble confession. Christ
   affirms that the Pharisee was rejected, and that the prayers of the
   publican were acceptable to God. The reasons why the Pharisee was
   rejected are stated to be these two: he trusted in himself that he was
   righteous, and despised others

   11. God, I thank thee. And yet he is not blamed for boasting of the
   strength of his free-will, but for trusting that God was reconciled to
   him by the merits of his works. For this thanksgiving, which is
   presented exclusively in his own name, does not at all imply that he
   boasted of his own virtue, as if he had obtained righteousness from
   himself, or merited any thing by his own industry. On the contrary, he
   ascribes it to the grace of God that he is righteous. Now though his
   thanksgiving to God implies an acknowledgment, that all the good works
   which he possessed were purely the gift of God, yet as he places
   reliance on works, and prefers himself to others, himself and his
   prayer are alike rejected. Hence we infer that men are not truly and
   properly humbled, though they are convinced that they can do nothing,
   unless they likewise distrust the merits of works, and learn to place
   their salvation in the undeserved goodness of God, so as to rest upon
   it all their confidence.

   This is a remarkable passage; for some think it enough if they take
   from man the glory of good works, so far as they are the gifts of the
   Holy Spirit; and accordingly they admit that we are justified freely,
   because God finds in us no righteousness but what he bestowed. But
   Christ goes farther, not only ascribing to the grace of the Spirit the
   power of acting aright, but stripping us of all confidence in works;
   for the Pharisee is not blamed on the ground of claiming for himself
   what belongs to God, but because he trusts to his works, that God will
   be reconciled to him, because he deserves it. Let us therefore know
   that, though a man may ascribe to God the praise of works, yet if he
   imagines the righteousness of those works to be the cause of his
   salvation, or rests upon it, he is condemned for wicked arrogance. And
   observe, that he is not charged with the vainglorious ambition of those
   who indulge in boasting before men, while they are inwardly conscious
   of their own wickedness, but is charged with concealed hypocrisy; for
   he is not said to have been the herald of his own praises, but to have
   prayed silently within himself. Though he did not proclaim aloud the
   honor of his own righteousness, his internal pride was abominable in
   the sight of God. His boasting consists of two parts: first, he acquits
   himself of that guilt in which all men are involved; and, secondly, he
   brings forward his virtues. He asserts that he is not as other men,
   because he is not chargeable with crimes which everywhere prevail in
   the world.

   12. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. This
   is equivalent to saying that he performed more than the law required;
   just as the Popish monks talk loftily of their works of supererogation,
   as if they found no great difficulty in fulfilling the law of God. It
   must be admitted that each of us, according to the measure of the
   virtues which God has bestowed upon him, is the more strongly bound to
   thank the Author of them; and that it is an exercise of holy meditation
   for each of us to ponder on the benefits which he has received, so as
   not to bury in ingratitude the kindness of God. But there are two
   things here that must be observed: we must not swell with confidence,
   as if we had satisfied God; and, next, we must not look down with
   disdainful contempt upon our brethren. In both respects the Pharisee
   erred; for, by falsely claiming righteousness for himself, he left
   nothing to the mercy of God; and, next, he despised all others in
   comparison of himself. And, indeed, that thanksgiving would not have
   been disapproved by Christ, if it had not labored under these two
   defects; [328] but as the proud hypocrite, by winking at his sins, met
   the justice of God with a pretense of complete and perfect
   righteousness, his wicked and detestable hardihood could not but make
   him fall. For the only hope of the godly, so long as they labor under
   the weakness of the flesh, is, after acknowledging what is good in
   them, [329] to betake themselves to the mercy of God alone, and to rest
   their salvation on prayer for forgiveness. [330]

   But it may be asked, how did this man, who was blinded by wicked pride,
   maintain such sanctity of life; for such integrity proceeds only from
   the Spirit of God, who, we are certain, does not reign in hypocrites? I
   reply: he trusted only to outward appearance, as if the hidden and
   inward uncleanness of the heart would not be taken into the account.
   Though he was full of wicked desires within, yet as he looks only at
   the appearance, he boldly maintains his innocence.

   Our Lord does not, indeed, accuse him of vanity, in falsely claiming
   for himself what he does not possess; but it ought to be believed that
   no man is pure from extortion, injustice, uncleanness, and other vices,
   unless he is governed by the Spirit of God.

   The word Sabbath (sabbaton) denotes in this passage, as in many others,
   a week But God never enjoined in the Law that his servants should fast
   every week; so that this fasting and the tithes were voluntary
   exercises beyond the prescriptions of the Law. [331]

   13. The publican standing at a distance. Here Christ did not intend to
   lay down a general rule, as if it were necessary, whenever we pray, to
   cast down our eyes to the ground. He merely describes the tokens of
   humility, which alone he recommends to his disciples. Now humility lies
   in not refusing to acknowledge our sins, but condemning ourselves, and
   thus anticipating the judgment of God; and, with the view of being
   reconciled to God, in making an honest confession of guilt. Such, too,
   is the cause of that shame which always accompanies repentance; for
   Christ insists chiefly on this point, that the publican sincerely
   acknowledged himself to be miserable and lost, and fled to the mercy of
   God. Though he is a sinner, he trusts to a free pardon, and hopes that
   God will be gracious to him. In a word, in order to obtain favor, he
   owns that he does not deserve it. And, certainly, since it is the
   forgiveness of sins that alone reconciles God to us, [332] we must
   begin with this, if we desire that he would accept our prayers. He who
   acknowledges that he is guilty and convicted, and then proceeds to
   implore pardon, disavows all confidence in works; and Christ's object
   was to show that God will not be gracious to any but those who betake
   themselves with trembling to his mercy alone. [333]

   14. This man went down justified. The comparison is not exact; for
   Christ does not merely assign to the publican a certain degree of
   superiority, as if righteousness had belonged alike to both, but means
   that the publican was accepted by God, while the Pharisee was totally
   rejected. And this passage shows plainly what is the strict meaning of
   the word justified: it means, to stand before God as if we were
   righteous. For it is not said that the publican was justified, because
   he suddenly acquired some new quality, but that he obtained grace,
   because his guilt was blotted out, and his sins were washed away. Hence
   it follows, that righteousness consists in the forgiveness of sins. As
   the virtues of the Pharisee were defiled and polluted by unfounded
   confidence, so that his integrity, which deserved commendation before
   the world, was of no value in the sight of God; so the publican,
   relying on no merits of works, obtained righteousness solely by
   imploring pardon, [334] because he had no other ground of hope than the
   pure mercy of God.

   But it may be thought absurd, that all should be reduced to the same
   level, since the purity of saints is widely different from that of the
   publican I reply: whatever proficiency any man may have made in the
   worship of God and in true holiness, yet if he consider how far he is
   still deficient, there is no other form of prayer which he can properly
   use than to begin with the acknowledgment of guilt; for though some are
   more, and others less, yet all are universally guilty. We cannot doubt,
   therefore, that Christ now lays down a rule for all to this effect,
   that God will not be pacified towards us, unless we distrust works, and
   pray that we may be freely reconciled. And, indeed, the Papists are
   compelled to acknowledge this in part, but immediately afterwards they
   debase this doctrine by a wicked invention. They admit that all need
   the remedy of forgiveness, because no man is perfect; but they first
   intoxicate wretched men with reliance on what they call imperfect
   righteousness, and next add satisfactions, in order to blot out their
   guilt. But our faith needs no other support than this, that God has
   accepted us, not because we deserved it, but because he does not impute
   our sins.

   Luke 17:11-21

   Luke 17:11-21

   11. And it happened, while he was going to Jerusalem, that he passed
   through the midst of Samaria and of Galilee. 12. And as he was entering
   into a certain village, there met him ten men, lepers, who stood at a
   distance; 13. And, lifting up their voice, said, Jesus, Master, take
   pity on us. 14. When he saw them, he said, Go, show yourselves to the
   priests. And it happened that, while they were going, they were
   cleansed. 15. And one of them, when he saw that he was cleansed, turned
   back, glorifying God with a loud voice, 16. And fell on his face [335]
   at his feet, thanking him: and he was a Samaritan. 17. And Jesus
   answering said, Were not ten cleansed? But where are the nine? 18. None
   are found that have returned to give glory to God except this stranger.
   19. And he saith to him, Arise, go, thy faith hath saved thee. [336]
   20. And being interrogated by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God
   would come, he replied to them and said, The kingdom of God will not
   come with observation; [337] 21. For they shall not say, Lo, he is
   here! or, Lo, he is there! for, lo, the kingdom of God is within you.


   As, on a former occasion, Matthew and the other two Evangelists
   (Matthew 8:1; Mark 1:40; Luke 5:12) related that a leper had been
   cleansed by Christ, so Luke mentions that the same miracle of healing
   was performed on ten lepers The object of this narrative, however, is
   different; for it describes the base and incredible ingratitude of the
   Jewish nation, to prevent us from wondering that so many of Christ's
   favors had been suppressed, and so many of his wonderful works buried,
   among them. One circumstance, too, is added, which greatly heightens
   the infamy of their crime. Our Lord had cured nine Jews: yet not one of
   them returned thanks, but, with the view of obliterating the
   remembrance of their disease, they privately stole away. One man
   only--a Samaritan--acknowledged his obligation to Christ. There is,
   therefore, on the one hand, a display of Christ's divine power; and, on
   the other hand, a reproof of the impiety of the Jews, in consequence of
   which so remarkable a miracle as this received scarcely any attention.

   13. Jesus, Master [338] It is evident that all of them possessed some
   measure of faith, not only because they implore Christ's assistance,
   but because they honor him with the title of Master That they made use
   of that expression sincerely, and not in hypocrisy, may be inferred
   from their ready obedience; for, although they perceive that the filthy
   scab still remains in their flesh, yet as soon as they are commanded to
   show themselves to the priests, they do not refuse to obey. Add to this
   that, but for the influence of faith, they would never have set out to
   show themselves to the priests; for it would have been absurd to
   present themselves to the judges of leprosy, for the purpose of
   attesting that they had been cleansed, if the promise of Christ had
   been regarded by them as of no more value than a mere inspection of the
   disease. They bear a visible leprosy in their flesh; and yet, trusting
   to Christ's word alone, they have no scruple about declaring that they
   are clean. It cannot therefore be denied, that some seed of faith had
   been implanted in their hearts. Now though it is certain that they were
   not regenerated by the Spirit of adoption, yet there is no absurdity in
   supposing that they had some beginnings of piety. There is the greater
   reason to fear that sparks of faith, which make their appearance in us,
   may be extinguished; for, although lively faith, which has its roots
   deeply fixed by the Spirit of regeneration, never dies, yet we have
   seen formerly that many conceive a temporary faith, which immediately
   disappears. Above all, it is too common a disease that, when we are
   urged by strong necessity, and when the Lord himself prompts us by a
   secret movement of the Spirit, we seek God, but, when we have obtained
   our wishes, ungrateful forgetfulness swallows up that feeling of piety.
   Thus poverty and hunger beget faith, but abundance kills it.

   14. Show yourselves to the priests This reply was equivalent to saying,
   "You are clean;" for we know that the discernment of leprosy belonged
   to the priests, who were enjoined in the law to distinguish between the
   clean and the unclean, (Leviticus 14:2.) Thus Christ preserves their
   right entire, and appeals to them as witnesses for approving of the
   miracle which he had wrought; and we have accordingly said, that pious
   and devout sentiments concerning Christ must have been entertained by
   those men who were instantly led, by his bare word, to entertain the
   hope of a cure.

   On this passage the Papists absurdly build their auricular confession.
   The lepers, I admit, were sent by Christ to the priests; but it was not
   for the purpose of vomiting out their sins into their ears. On the
   contrary, they were sent to offer a sacrifice, as the Law had enjoined.
   They were not sent to cleanse themselves, as the Papists imagine that
   cleanness is produced by confession, but to show to the priests that
   they were already clean. It is an additional proof of the folly of the
   Papists, that they do not consider what a foul stain of infamy they
   throw on their confession; for, according to their reasoning, it will
   be quite enough if, out of the whole troop of those who have gone to
   the priests, a tenth part only shall return to Christ, and all the rest
   shall wickedly revolt. They cannot plead this passage in behalf of
   their confession, without giving us liberty to throw back upon them
   this advantage which it yields, that none return from the priests to
   give glory to God. But, not to dwell on these fooleries, we have
   ascertained the reason why the priests were mentioned.

   It happened that, while they were going, they were cleansed. Here was
   displayed the divine power of Christ and of his words, and there was
   also a proof of the high estimation in which God holds the obedience of
   faith; for the great suddenness of the cure arose from the confident
   hope which induced them to undertake the journey, without hesitation,
   at the command of Christ. But if that transitory faith--which wanted a
   living root, and produced nothing more than the blade--was honored by
   God with a remarkable effect, how much more valuable is the reward that
   awaits our faith, if it is sincerely and permanently fixed on God?
   Though the nine lepers derived no advantage to salvation from the cure
   of the flesh, but only obtained a temporary gift by means of a fleeting
   and transitory faith, yet this figure points out to us the great
   efficacy which will attend true faith.

   15. And one of them, etc. It is uncertain if he returned when they were
   halfway, and Luke's words appear to imply this; but I think it more
   probable, that it was not till he had heard the decision of the priests
   that he returned to give thanks. He must have obtained permission from
   the priests to return to the ordinary intercourse of life; and he had
   no right to neglect the command of Christ, and to defraud the temple of
   God of a sacrifice. Some will perhaps be better pleased with a
   different conjecture, that as soon as he saw that he was cleansed, and
   before he applied to the priests for a testimony, he was seized with a
   devout and holy zeal, and returned to the Author of the cure, so as to
   commence his sacrifice with thanksgiving. The words of Christ contain
   an expostulation with the whole nation; for it is by way of reproach
   that he draws a comparison between one stranger and many Jews, because
   it was customary with them to swallow up God's favors without any
   feeling of piety. And this was the reason why Christ gained hardly any
   reputation among them by miracles so numerous and so splendid. Let us
   learn that this complaint is brought generally against all of us, if we
   do not at least repay the divine favors by the duty of gratitude.

   19. Thy faith hath saved thee. The word save is restricted by some
   commentators to the cleanness of the flesh. [339] But if this be the
   case, since Christ commends the lively faith of this Samaritan, it may
   be asked, how were the other nine saved? for all of them without
   exception obtained the same cure. [340] We must therefore arrive at the
   conclusion, that Christ has here pronounced a different estimate of the
   gift of God from that which is usually pronounced by ungodly men;
   namely, that it was a token or pledge of God's fatherly love. The nine
   lepers were cured; but as they wickedly efface the remembrance of the
   grace of God, the cure itself is debased and contaminated by their
   ingratitude, so that they do not derive from it the advantage which
   they ought. It is faith alone that sanctifies the gifts of God to us,
   so that they become pure, and, united to the lawful use of them,
   contribute to our salvation. Lastly, by this word Christ has informed
   us in what manner we lawfully enjoy divine favors. Hence we infer, that
   he included the eternal salvation of the soul along with the temporal
   gift. The Samaritan was saved by his faith How? Certainly not because
   he was cured of leprosy, (for this was likewise obtained by the rest,)
   but because he was admitted into the number of the children of God, and
   received from His hand a pledge of fatherly kindness.

   20. And being interrogated by the Pharisees This question was
   undoubtedly put in mockery; for, since Christ was continually speaking
   of the kingdom of God as at hand, while no change was taking place in
   the outward condition of the Jews, wicked and malicious persons looked
   upon this as a plausible excuse for harassing him. As if all that
   Christ said about the kingdom of God were idle talk and mere trifling,
   they put a sarcastic question to him, "When shall that kingdom come?"
   If any one shall consider this question to have been put on account of
   the grossness of their own views, rather than for the sake of jeering,
   I have no objection.

   The kingdom of God will not come with observation. My opinion is, that
   Christ now disregards those dogs, and accommodates this reply to the
   disciples; just as on many other occasions, when he was provoked by
   wicked men, and seized the opportunity of giving instruction. In this
   manner God disappoints their malice, while the truth, which is
   maintained in opposition to their sophistry, is the more fully
   displayed.

   The word observation is here employed by Christ to denote extraordinary
   splendor; [341] and he declares, that the kingdom of God will not make
   its appearance at a distance, or attended by pompous display. He means,
   that they are greatly mistaken who seek with the eyes of the flesh the
   kingdom of God, which is in no respect carnal or earthly, for it is
   nothing else than the inward and spiritual renewal of the soul. From
   the nature of the kingdom itself he shows that they are altogether in
   the wrong, who look around here or there, in order to observe visible
   marks. "That restoration of the Church," he tells us, "which God has
   promised, must be looked for within; for, by quickening his elect into
   a heavenly newness of life, he establishes his kingdom within them."
   And thus he indirectly reproves the stupidity of the Pharisees, because
   they aimed at nothing but what was earthly and fading. It must be
   observed, however, that Christ speaks only of the beginnings of the
   kingdom of God; for we now begin to be formed anew by the Spirit after
   the image of God, in order that our entire renovation, and that of the
   whole world, may afterwards follow in due time.

   Matthew 13:53-58; Mark 6:1-6

   Matthew 13:53-58

   Mark 6:1-6

   53. And it happened, when Jesus had concluded these discourses, [342]
   that he departed thence. 54. And when he was come into his own country,
   he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were amazed, and said,
   Whence hath this man this wisdom and these miracles? 55. Is not this
   the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers
   James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? 56. And his sisters, do not
   they all live amongst us? Whence then hath this man all these things?
   57. And they were offended at him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is
   not destitute of honor, except in his own country and in his own house.
   58. And he did not perform many miracles there on account of their
   unbelief.


   1. And he departed thence, and came into his own country, and his
   disciples followed him. 2. And when it was Sabbath, he began to teach
   in the synagogue, and many hearing were amazed, saying, Whence hath
   this man these things? [343] And what is the wisdom that hath been
   given to him, so that such miracles are done by his hands? 3. Is not
   this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses,
   and Judas, and Simon? Are not his sisters also here with us? And they
   were offended at him. 4. And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not
   devoid of honor, [344] except in his own country, and among his
   relatives, and in his own family. 5. And he could not perform any
   miracle there, except that he cured a few sick persons by laying his
   hands on them. 6. And he wondered at their unbelief, and walked about
   through the surrounding villages teaching.


   Matthew 13:53. When Jesus had concluded. Matthew does not mean, that
   immediately after delivering these discourses, he came into his own
   country; for it is evident from Mark, that some interval of time
   elapsed. But the meaning is, that after having taught for some time in
   Judea, he returned again to the Galileans, but did not receive from
   them kind treatment. A narrative which Luke gives (4:22) is nearly
   similar, but is not the same. Nor ought we to wonder that Christ's
   countrymen, when they perceived that his family was mean and despised,
   and that he had been poorly educated, were at first so much offended as
   to murmur at his doctrine, and afterwards persevered in the same malice
   to such an extent, that they did not cease to slander him, when he
   chose to discharge the office of a prophet amongst them. This second
   rejection of Christ shows that the space of time which had intervened
   had not effected a reformation on the inhabitants of Nazareth, but that
   the same contempt was constantly thrown as an obstacle in the way, to
   prevent them from hearing Christ. [345]

   54. So that they were amazed. They are struck with amazement at the
   novelty of the occurrence, that Christ, who had not learned letters,
   but had been employed from youth to manhood in a mechanical occupation,
   is so eminent a teacher, and is filled with divine wisdom. In this
   miracle they ought to have perceived the hand of God; but their
   ingratitude made them cover themselves with darkness. [346] They are
   compelled to admire him, whether they will or not; and yet they treat
   him with contempt. And what is this but to reject a prophet whom God
   has taught, because he has not been educated by men? They cut their
   throat by means of their own acknowledgment, when they render so
   honorable a testimony to the doctrine of Christ, which after all has no
   influence on them, because it does not take its origin, in the usual
   way, from the earth. Why do they not rather lift their eyes to heaven,
   and learn that what exceeds human reason must have come from God?

   Besides, the miracles, which were added to the doctrine, ought to have
   affected them the more powerfully, or at least to have aroused them
   from their excessive carelessness and stupidity to glorify God; for
   certainly, when God adopts unwonted methods of procedure, so much the
   more clearly does he display the power of his hand. And yet this was
   the very reason why the inhabitants of Nazareth maliciously drew a veil
   over their eyes. We see, then, that it is not mere ignorance that
   hinders men, but that, of their own accord, they search after grounds
   of offense, to prevent them from following the path to which God
   invites. We ought rather to argue in the opposite way, that, when human
   means fail, the power of God is clearly revealed to us, and ought to
   receive undivided praise.

   55. Is not this the carpenter's son? It was, we are aware, by the
   wonderful purpose of God, that Christ remained in private life till he
   was thirty years of age. Most improperly and unjustly, therefore, were
   the inhabitants of Nazareth offended on this account; for they ought
   rather to have received him with reverence, as one who had suddenly
   come down from heaven. They see God working in Christ, and
   intentionally turn away their eyes from this sight, to behold Joseph,
   and Mary, and all his relatives; thus interposing a veil to shut out
   the clearest light. The word brothers, we have formerly mentioned, is
   employed, agreeably to the Hebrew idiom, to denote any relatives
   whatever; and, accordingly, Helvidius displayed excessive ignorance in
   concluding that Mary must have had many sons, because Christ's brothers
   are sometimes mentioned. [347]

   57. A prophet is not devoid of honor. I have explained this statement
   at considerable length, where it occurs in the Gospel of John, [348]
   (4:44.) It may, no doubt, be a general proverb, that those who are
   distinguished by eminent gifts are nowhere held in less estimation than
   in their own country; and this manifests the ingratitude of men, who,
   in proportion to the greater familiarity with which God exhibits
   himself to them, are the more bold to reject him in the influences of
   his Spirit. I readily agree, however, with Chrysostom, who thinks that
   this proverb was applied in a peculiar manner to the Jews. But what was
   usually spoken against the whole nation, Christ now asserts with
   special reference to his Galilean countrymen; for nowhere did he
   receive less honor than on his native soil. There were good grounds for
   the charge which he brings against them, that, instead of being the
   first to accept the grace offered to them, as they ought to have been,
   they drive him to a distance from them; for it is truly extraordinary
   that a prophet of God, whom others warmly receive as a newly-arrived
   stranger, should be despised in the place where he was born.

   58. And he did not perform many miracles in that place. Mark states it
   more emphatically, that he could not perform any miracle. But they are
   perfectly agreed as to the substance of what is said, that it was the
   impiety of Christ's countrymen that closed the door against the
   performance of a greater number of miracles among them. He had already
   given them some taste of his power; but they willingly stupify
   themselves, so as to have no relish for it. Accordingly, Augustine
   justly compares faith to the open mouth of a vessel, while he speaks of
   faith as resembling a stopper, by which the vessel is closed, so as not
   to receive the liquor [349] which God pours into it. And undoubtedly
   this is the case; for when the Lord perceives that his power is not
   accepted by us, he at length withdraws it; and yet we complain that we
   are deprived of his aid, which our unbelief rejects and drives far from
   us.

   When Mark declares that Christ could not perform any miracles, he
   represents the aggravated guilt of those by whom his goodness was
   prevented; for certainly unbelievers, as far as lies in their power,
   bind up the hands of God by their obstinacy; not that God is overcome,
   as if he were an inferior, but because they do not permit him to
   display his power. We must observe, however, what Mark adds, that some
   sick people, notwithstanding, were cured; for hence we infer, that the
   goodness of Christ strove with their malice, and triumphed over every
   obstacle. [350] We have experience of the same thing daily with respect
   to God; for, though he justly and reluctantly restrains his power,
   because the entrance to us is shut against him, yet we see that he
   opens up a path for himself where none exists, and ceases not to bestow
   favors upon us. What an amazing contest, that while we are endeavoring
   by every possible method to hinder the grace of God from coming to us,
   it rises victorious, and displays its efficacy in spite of all our
   exertions!

   Matthew 14:1-2; Mark 6:14-16; Luke 9:7-9

   Matthew 14:1-2

   Mark 6:14-16

   Luke 9:7-9

   1. At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, 2. And
   said to his servants, This is John the Baptist: he is raised from the
   dead, and therefore miracles work in him.


   14. And king Herod heard of him, (for his name had become celebrated,)
   and said, John, who baptized, hath risen from the dead, and therefore
   miracles are performed by him. 15. Others said, It is Elijah; and
   others said, It is a prophet, or as one of the prophets. 16. But when
   Herod heard that, he said, It is John whom I beheaded, he hath rasen
   from the dead.


   7. Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him, and was
   perplexed, because it was said by some that Christ had risen from the
   dead; 8. And by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one
   of the ancient prophets had risen again. 9. And Herod said, John have I
   beheaded, but who is this of whom I hear such things? And he desired to
   see him.


   The reason why the Evangelists relate this occurrence is, to inform us
   that the name of Christ was universally celebrated, and, therefore, the
   Jews could not be excused on the plea of ignorance. Many might
   otherwise have been perplexed by this question, "How came it that,
   while Christ dwelt on the earth, Judea remained in a profound sleep, as
   if he had withdrawn into some corner, and had displayed to none his
   divine power?" The Evangelists accordingly state, that the report
   concerning him was everywhere spread abroad, and penetrated even into
   the court of Herod.

   2. And said to his servants. From the words of Luke it may be inferred,
   that Herod did not of his own accord adopt this conjecture, but that it
   was suggested to him by a report which was current among the people.
   And, indeed, I have no doubt that the hatred which they bore to the
   tyrant, and their detestation of so shocking a murder, gave rise, as is
   commonly the ease, to those rumors. It was a superstition deeply
   rooted, as we have formerly mentioned, in the minds of men, that the
   dead return to life in a different person. Nearly akin to this is the
   opinion which they now adopt, that Herod, when he cruelly put to death
   the holy man, was far from obtaining what he expected; because he had
   suddenly risen from the dead by the miraculous power of God, and would
   oppose and attack his enemies with greater severity than ever.

   Mark and Luke, however, show that men spoke variously on this subject:
   some thought that he was Elijah, and others that he was one of the
   prophets, or that he was so eminently endued with the gifts of the
   Spirit, that he might be compared to the prophets. The reason why they
   thought that he might be Elijah, rather than any other prophet, has
   been already stated. Malachi having predicted (4:5,6) that Elijah would
   come to gather the scattered Church, they misunderstood that prediction
   as relating to the person of Elijah, instead of being a simple
   comparison to the following effect: "That the coming of Messiah may not
   be unknown, and that the people may not remain ignorant of the grace of
   redemption, there will be an Elijah to go before, like him who of old
   raised up that which was fallen, and the worship of God which had been
   overthrown. He will go before, by a remarkable power of the Spirit, to
   proclaim the great and dreadful day of the Lord." The Jews, with their
   usual grossness of interpretation, had applied this to Elijah the
   Tishbite, (1 Kings 17:1,) as if he were to appear again and discharge
   the office of a prophet. Others again conjecture, either that some one
   of the ancient prophets had risen, or that he was some great man, who
   approached to them in excellence.

   It was astonishing that, amidst the diversity of views which were
   suggested, the true interpretation did not occur to any one; more
   especially as the state of matters at that very time directed them to
   Christ. God had promised to them a Redeemer, who would relieve them
   when they were distressed and in despair. The extremity of affliction
   into which they had been plunged was a loud call for divine assistance.
   The Redeemer is at hand, who had been so clearly pointed out by the
   preaching of John, and who himself testifies respecting his office.
   They are compelled to acknowledge that some divine power belongs to
   him, and yet they fall into their own fancies, and change him into the
   persons of other men. It is thus that the world is wont, in base
   ingratitude, to obliterate the remembrance of the favors which God has
   bestowed.

   With respect to Herod himself, as I hinted, little ago, the conjecture
   that John had risen did not at first occur to himself; but as bad
   consciences are wont to tremble and hesitate, and turn with every wind,
   he readily believed what he dreaded. With such blind terrors God
   frequently alarms wicked men; so that, after all the pains they take to
   harden themselves, and to escape agitation, their internal executioner
   gives them no rest, but chastises them with severity.

   And therefore miracles work in him. We naturally wonder what reasoning
   could have led them to this conclusion. John had performed no miracle
   during the whole course of his preaching. There appears to be no
   probability, therefore, in the conjecture, that it was John whom they
   saw performing extraordinary miracles. But they imagine that miracles
   are now performed by him for the first time, in order to prove his
   resurrection, and to show that the holy prophet of God had been
   wickedly put to death by Herod, and now came forward with a visible and
   divine protection, that no man might afterwards venture to assail him.
   They think that miracles work (enezgousin) in him; that is, are
   powerfully displayed, so as to give him greater authority, and make it
   evident that the Lord is with him.

   Matthew 14:3-12

   Mark 6:17-29

   3. For Herod had seized John, and bound him, and put him in prison, on
   account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip. 4. For John said
   to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her. 5. And though he wished
   to put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they accounted
   him a prophet. 6. But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of
   Herodias danced before the company, and pleased Herod. 7. And therefore
   he promised with an oath, that he would give her whatever she would
   ask. 8. But she, after having been instructed by her mother, said Give
   me here in a dish the head of John the Baptist. 9. And the king was
   sorry, yet on account of the oath, and of those who sat with him at
   table, he commanded that it should be given. 10. And he sent and
   beheaded John in the prison. 11. And his head was brought in a dish and
   given to the girl, and she carried it to her mother. 12. And his
   disciples came and carried away the body, and buried it, and went and
   told Jesus.


   17. For Herod himself had sent, and seized John, and bound him in
   prison, on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, because
   he had married her. 18. For John said to Herod, It is not lawful for
   thee to have thy brother's wife. 19. And Herodias lay in wait for him,
   and wished to kill him, and could not. 20. For Herod dreaded John,
   knowing that he was a just and holy man, and observed him, and, having
   heard him, did many things, and heard him gladly. 21. And when a
   convenient day came, when Herod on his birthday made a supper to the
   nobles, and captains, and distinguished men of Galilee; 22. And when
   the daughter of Herodias entered, and danced, and pleased Herod, and
   those who sat at table with him, the king said to the girl, Ask any
   thing from me, [351] and I will give it to thee. 23. And he swore to
   her, Whatever thou shalt ask of me, I will give to thee, even to the
   half of my kingdom. 24. But she went out and said to her mother, What
   shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. 25. And she
   went in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, saying, I wish
   that thou wouldst give to me immediately in a dish the head of John the
   Baptist. 26. And the king being sorry on account of the oath, and of
   those who sat at table with him, would not refuse her. [352] 27. And he
   immediately sent a spearman, [353] and commanded that his head should
   be brought: and he went, and beheaded him in the prison. 28. And he
   brought his head in a dish, and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave
   it to her mother. 29. And when his disciples heard of this, they carne
   and carried off his body, and laid it in a tomb.



   This narrative is at present omitted by Luke, because he had explained
   it on a former occasion; and for my own part, as I am unwilling to
   annoy my readers by writing the same thing twice, I shall handle this
   passage with greater brevity [354] The Evangelists relate that John was
   seized, because he had openly condemned Herod for carrying off
   Herodias, and for his incestuous marriage with her. Josephus assigns a
   different reason, namely, that Herod, dreading on his own account a
   change of affairs, regarded John with suspicion, (Ant. 18. 5:2;) and it
   is possible that this may have been the pretext on which the tyrant
   excused his crime, or that such a report may have been in circulation;
   for it frequently happens that various motives are assigned for unjust
   violence and cruelty. The true state of the fact, however, is pointed
   out by the Evangelists: Herod was offended at the holy man, because he
   had been reproved by him.

   Josephus is mistaken in supposing that Herodias was carried off, not
   from his brother Philip, but from Herod, King of Chalcis, his uncle,
   (Ant. 18:5:4.) For not only was the crime still recent when the
   Evangelists wrote, but it was committed before the eyes of all. What is
   elsewhere stated by Josephus, (Ant. 18:4:6,) that Philip was a person
   of amiable dispositions, emboldened Herod, I have no doubt, to expect
   that an outrage committed on a mild, gentle, and peaceable man, would
   pass with impunity. Another probable conjecture may be mentioned. There
   is greater reason to suppose that Herodias was married to her uncle
   Philip than to her grand-uncle, her grandfather's brother, who must
   have been at that time in the decrepitude of old age. Now Herod Antipas
   (who is here mentioned) and Philip were not brothers by the same
   mother; for Herod was the son of Marthaca, third wife of Herod the
   Great, and Philip was the son of Cleopatra. [355]

   To return to the Evangelists, they tell us that John was thrown into
   prison, because he had reproved Herod's crime with greater freedom than
   the ferocity of the tyrant would endure. The atrocious character of the
   deed was in itself sufficiently detestable and infamous; for not only
   did he keep in his own house another man's wife, whom he had torn away
   from lawful wedlock, but the person on whom he had committed this
   outrage was his own brother. When, in addition to this, he is freely
   reproved by John, Herod has some reason to fear that sedition will
   suddenly break out. His lust did not allow him to correct his fault;
   but having imprisoned the prophet of God, he promises to himself repose
   and liberty. [356]

   Ignorance of history has led many persons into a fruitless debate;
   "Have I a right to marry the woman who was formerly married to my
   brother?" Though the modesty of nature recoils from such a marriage,
   [357] yet John condemns the rape still more than the incest; for it was
   by violence or by stratagem [358] that Herod had deprived his brother
   of his lawful wife: and otherwise it would have been less lawful for
   him to marry his niece than to marry his brother's widow. There cannot
   be a doubt, that a crime so flagrant was universally blamed. But others
   loaded Herod with their curses in his absence. John alone comes into
   his presence, and reproves him boldly to his face, if by any means he
   may be brought to repentance. Hence we learn with what unshaken
   fortitude the servants of God ought to be armed when they have to do
   with princes; for in almost every court hypocrisy and servile flattery
   are prevalent; and the ears of princes, having been accustomed to this
   smooth language, do not tolerate any voice which reproves their vices
   with any severity. But as a prophet of God ought not to overlook so
   shocking a crime, John steps forward, though a disagreeable and
   unwelcome adviser, and, rather than fail in his duty, scruples not to
   incur the frown of the tyrant, even though he knew Herod to be so
   strongly held by the snares of the prostitute, that he could scarcely
   be moved from his purpose.

   5. And though he wished to put him to death. There is some appearance
   of contradiction between the words of Matthew and Mark: for the former
   says that Herod was desirous to commit this shocking murder, but was
   restrained by the fear of the people; while the latter charges Herodias
   alone with this cruelty. But the difficulty is soon removed. At first
   Herod would have been unwilling, if a stronger necessity had not
   compelled him reluctantly to do so, to put to death the holy man;
   because he regarded him with reverence, and, indeed, was prevented by
   religious scruples from practising such atrocious cruelty against a
   prophet of God; and that he afterwards shook off this fear of God, in
   consequence of the incessant urgency of Herodias; but that afterwards,
   when infuriated by that demon he longed for the death of the holy man,
   he was withheld by a new restraint, because he dreaded on his own
   account a popular commotion. And here we must attend to the words of
   Mark, Herodias lay in wait for him; [359] which imply, that as Herod
   was not of himself sufficiently disposed to commit the murder, she
   either attempted to gain him over by indirect wiles, or labored to find
   some secret method of putting the holy man to death. I am more disposed
   to adopt the former view, that she employed stratagems for influencing
   the mind of her husband, but did not succeed, so long as Herod was
   prevented by remorse of conscience from pronouncing sentence of death
   on the holy man. Next followed another fear that the business of his
   death should excite the people to some insurrection. But Mark glances
   only at what prevented Herod from yielding immediately to the
   entreaties of the prostitute; for Herodias would have wished that, as
   soon as John was thrown into prison, he should be privately executed.
   Herod, on the contrary, reverenced the holy man, so far as even to
   comply willingly with his advises: Herod feared John Now the fear which
   is here mentioned, was not a dread arising from a mistaken opinion, as
   we dread those who have obtained some authority over us, though we
   reckon them to be unworthy of the honor. But this fear was a voluntary
   respect; for Herod was convinced that he was a holy man and a faithful
   servant of God, and therefore did not dare to despise him. [360] And
   this deserves our attention; for though John knew by experience that it
   was, in many respects, advantageous for him to have some share in the
   good wishes of the tetrarch, [361] yet he was not afraid to offend him,
   when he could find no other way of securing that favor, than by
   wickedly conniving at a known and disgraceful crime. He might indeed
   have protested that he did not at all consult his private interests,
   and that he had no other object in view than the public advantage; for
   it is certain that he requested nothing from motives of ambition [362]
   but that Herod yielded to his holy counsels, which had a reference to
   the lawful administration of the kingdom. But as he perceives that he
   has no right to accept this kind of compensation, [363] which would
   procure for him some kind offices by betraying the truth, he chooses
   rather to turn a friend into an enemy than to encourage, by flattery or
   silence, an evil which he is laid under the necessity of reproving with
   severity.

   John has thus, by his example, furnished an undoubted rule for pious
   teachers, not to wink at the faults of princes, so as to purchase their
   favor at this price, how advantageous soever that favor might appear to
   be to the public interests. [364] In Herod, on the other hand, the
   Spirit of God exhibits, as in a mirror, how frequently it happens that
   those who do not sincerely worship God are nevertheless willing, in
   some measure, to obey His commands, provided that He will grant them
   some indulgence or abatement. But whenever they are hard pressed, they
   throw off the yoke, and break out not only into obstinacy, but into
   rage. There is no reason, therefore, why they who comply with many
   sound advises should be well satisfied with themselves, till they have
   learned to yield and surrender themselves unreservedly to God.

   6. And when Herod's birthday was kept. The Evangelists now begin to
   relate the stratagem by which Herodias at length succeeded in a design
   which she had long meditated, the taking away of John's life. The
   opportunity was afforded to her by an annual festival, when Herod was
   celebrating his birthday. It is scarcely possible that such magnificent
   preparations should not draw luxury, pride, unbridled merriment, and
   other crimes, and likewise many other evils, along with them. Not that
   there is any thing wrong in the mere act of preparing an expensive
   banquet; but such is the tendency of the human mind to licentiousness,
   that when the reins are loosened, they quickly go astray. The ancient
   custom of observing a birthday every year as an occasion of joy cannot
   in itself be disapproved; for that day, as often as it returns, reminds
   each of us to give thanks to God, who brought us into this world, and
   has permitted us, in his kindness, to spend many years in it; next, to
   bring to our recollection how improperly and uselessly the time which
   God granted to us has been permitted to pass away; and, lastly, that we
   ought to commit ourselves to the protection of the same God for the
   remainder of our life.

   But nothing is so pure that the world shall not taint it with its own
   vices. A birthday, which ought to have been held sacred, is profaned by
   the greater part of men with disgraceful abuses; and there is scarcely
   a single entertainment at all costly that is free from wicked
   debauchery. First, men drink more freely; next, the door is opened to
   filthy and immodest conversation; and, lastly, no moderation is
   observed. This was the reason why the patriarch Job was in the habit of
   offering sacrifices, while his sons were feasting alternately in each
   other's houses, (Job 1:5.) It was because he thought that, when the
   guests invite one another to mirth, they are far from maintaining due
   moderation, and sin in a variety of ways.

   Thus it happened that Herod, intending to give a rich entertainment to
   his guests, permitted his wife's daughter to dance. Hence, too, it
   appears what sort of discipline existed at his court; for, though most
   people at that time thought themselves at liberty to dance, yet for a
   marriageable young woman to dance was a shameful display of the
   impudence of the strumpet. But the unchaste Herodias had moulded her
   daughter Salome to her own manners in such a manner that she might not
   bring disgrace upon her. [365] And what was the consequence? The wicked
   murder of a holy prophet. The heat of wine had such an influence on
   Herod, that, forgetting gravity and prudence, he promised to a dancing
   girl, that he would give her even to the half of his kingdom. A
   shameful example truly, that a drunken king not only permits himself to
   behold with approbation a spectacle [366] which was disgraceful to his
   family, but holds out such a reward! Let us therefore learn to be
   careful in anticipating and resisting the devil, lest he entangle us in
   such snares.

   Mark 6:24. And she went out, and said to her mother We need not wonder
   that Herodias attached so much importance to John's death. [367] The
   conjecture thrown out by some--that she was actuated by revenge,--is
   not at all probable. It was rather the dread of being cast off that
   inflamed and tormented her; as it usually happens that, when adulterers
   are visited with feelings of uneasiness, they become ashamed of their
   own lust. But she hoped that this crime would bind Herod more closely
   to her than ever, if the disgrace of a pretended marriage were washed
   out by the blood of the prophet. That her power might be more secure
   for the future, she longed for the death of that man whom she imagined
   to be her only opponent; and this shows us the wretched anxiety by
   which a bad conscience is always tormented. John was detained in
   prison, and the haughty and cruel woman might have issued orders that
   no man should converse with or approach him; and yet she has no rest,
   but is oppressed with anxiety and alarm, till the prophet be removed
   out of the way. This likewise serves to show the power of the word of
   God, that the voice of the holy man, even when shut up in prison,
   wounds and tortures in the keenest manner the mind of the king's wife.
   [368]

   26. And the king being sorry. His heart, as we have said, was no longer
   influenced by religious sentiments; but, foreseeing the detestation
   that will be excited by such a crime, he dreads both the loss of
   character and positive harm, and consequently repents of his levity.
   And yet he has not the courage to give a refusal to a dancing girl,
   lest he should incur the reproach of unsteadiness; as if it were more
   dishonorable to retract a rash and foolish promise than to persist in a
   heinous crime. With the wonted vanity of kings, he does not choose that
   what he has once uttered shall be recalled, and orders that the prophet
   shall be instantly slain. We infer that Herod was at that time supping
   in the castle of Macherus, where, Josephus tells us, John was
   imprisoned, (Ant. 18. 5:2.)

   On account of the oath, and of those who sat at table with him. It
   deserves our attention that the Evangelists state this to be the reason
   of his grief; and hence we infer that, though he had sworn a hundred
   times, yet if there had been no witness, he would not have held by his
   oath. No inward feelings of religion constrained Herod to do this, but
   the mere love of power drove him headlong; for he reckoned that he
   would sink in the estimation of those who were present, if he did not
   fulfill his engagement. Thus it frequently happens that ungodly men
   fail to perform their duty, because they do not look to God, but are
   only intent on this object, that they may not incur the reproaches of
   men. [369] But though Herod had kept before his eyes the sacredness of
   an oath alone, and not the dread of the opinion of men, he committed a
   more heinous offense in fulfilling a foolish promise than if he had
   violated his oath. First, he was deeply in fault for such haste in
   swearing; for the design of an oath is to confirm a promise in a
   doubtful matter. Next, when it appeared that he could not be relieved
   from his engagement without involving himself in an aggravated crime,
   he had no right to implicate the sacred name of God in such wickedness;
   for what could be more at variance with the nature of God than to lend
   his countenance to a shocking murder? If a private loss is at stake,
   let him who has made a rash oath suffer the punishment of his folly;
   but, when a man has taken the name of God in vain, let him beware of
   doubling his guilt by employing this as a pretense for committing some
   enormous crime. Hence it follows, that monastic vows, which are
   attended by open impiety, do not bind the conscience any more than the
   enchantments of magicians; for it is not the will of God that his
   sacred name shall give support to what is sinful. But this passage
   teaches us, that we ought to beware of making promises without
   consideration; and next, that lightness must not be followed by
   obstinacy.

   28. And gave it to the girl. It was an additional aggravation of this
   detestable crime, that the head of the holy man was made, after his
   death, a matter of sport. But in this way the Lord sometimes gives up
   his people to the pride of wicked men, till he at length makes it
   evident that their blood is precious in his sight (Psalm 116:15.)
   Herodias is delighted with the thought of having gained her wicked
   purpose, and cruelly triumphs over her reprover; but when afterwards,
   stripped of her wealth, and not only deprived of the title of queen,
   but driven from her native country, and destitute of all means of
   support, she dragged out a wretched life in poverty and banishment, she
   presented a spectacle gratifying to angels and to all good people. When
   we perceive that the guests are compelled to pollute their eyes by
   beholding this detestable exhibition, let us learn from it, that those
   who sit at the tables of kings are often involved in many crimes; for,
   granting that the table is not stained by murder, every thing partakes
   so largely of all sorts of wickedness, that they who approach to it
   must be at least given up to debauchery.

   29. His disciples came. One thing only remained to complete the woman's
   cruelty. It was, to leave the corpse of the holy man unburied; for
   there is reason to believe that, when his disciples performed this
   duty, the attendants of the tyrant had thrown out the corpse. Though
   the honor of burial is of no importance to the dead, yet it is the will
   of the Lord that we should observe this ceremony as a token of the last
   resurrection; and therefore God was pleased with the carefulness which
   was manifested by the disciples, when they came to commit to the tomb
   the body of their master. Moreover, it was an attestation of their
   piety; for in this way they declared that the doctrine of their master
   continued to have a firm hold of their hearts after his death. This
   confession was therefore worthy of praise, more especially as it was
   not without danger; for they could not do honor to a man who had been
   put to death by the executioner without exciting against themselves the
   rage of the tyrant.

   Mark 6:30-44

   Luke 9:10-17

   13. When Jesus heard this, he departed thence to a ship to a desert
   place apart; and when the multitudes heard it, they followed him on
   foot out of the cities. 14. And Jesus, when leaving (the ship,) saw a
   great multitude, and was moved with compassion towards them, and healed
   of such of them as were diseased. 15. And when the evening was drawing
   on, his disciples came to him, saying, It is a desert place, and the
   time is now past: send the multitudes away, that they may go into the
   village, and purchase victuals for themselves. 16. And Jesus said to
   them, It is not necessary that they should go away: give you to them
   something to eat. 17. And they say to him, We have nothing here but
   five loaves and two fishes. 18. And he said, Bring them hither to me.
   19. And he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass, and,
   taking the five loaves and the two fishes, and raising his eyes to
   heaven, he blessed. [370] And when he had broken the loaves, he gave
   them to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. 20. And
   they all ate, and were satisfied, and carried away what remained of the
   fragments [371] twelve baskets full. 21. And they who had eaten were
   nearly five thousand men, besides women and children.

   30. And the Apostles assembled to Jesus, and related to him all things,
   both what they had done and what they had taught. [372] 31. And he said
   to them, Come you apart into a desert place, and rest for a little. For
   there were many who were coming and going, so that there was not even
   leisure to take food. [373] . 32. And he went into a desert place by
   ship apart. 33. And the multitude saw them departing, and many
   recognized him, and ran hither on foot out of all the cities, and went
   before them, and came together to him. 34. And Jesus, as he was leaving
   (the ship,) saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion
   towards them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd, and he
   began to teach them many things. 35. And when a great part of the day
   was already past, his disciples came to him, saying, It is a desert
   place, and the day is now far advanced. 36. Send them away, that they
   may go into the surrounding towns and villages and purchase bread for
   themselves; for they having nothing to eat. 37. And he answering said
   to them, Give you to them something to eat. And they said to him Shall
   we go and purchase bread for two hundred pence, and give them something
   to eat? 38. And he said to them, How many loaves have you? Go and see.
   And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes. 39. And he
   commanded them to make them all sit down, arranging the guests on the
   green grass. 40. And they sat down, arranged in hundreds, and fifties.
   41. And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, raising
   his eyes to heaven, he blessed, [374] and brake the loaves, and gave to
   the disciples to set before them, and divided the two fishes among them
   all. 42. And they all ate, and were satisfied. 43. And they carried
   away twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the fishes. 44. Now
   they who had eaten were about five thousand men.

   10. And the Apostles, having returned, [375] related to him all that
   they had done. And he took them, and withdrew apart into a desert
   place, near a city which is called Bethsaida. 11. And when the
   multitudes knew it, they followed him; and he received them, and spoke
   to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.
   12. And the day began to decline; and the twelve approached and said to
   him, Send away the multitudes, that they may go into the neighboring
   towns and villages, and procure food; for we are here in a desert
   place. 13. And he said to them, Give you to them something to eat. And
   they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; unless we
   go and buy food for all this people. 14. Now they were about five
   thousand men. And he saith to his disciples, Make them sit down, fifty
   in each division. 15. And they did so, and made them all sit down.
   16. And, taking the five loaves and the two fishes, he raised his eyes
   to heaven, and blessed them, and broke them, [376] and gave them to the
   disciples to set before the multitude. 17. And they all ate, and were
   satisfied; and there was carried away what was left of the fragments
   twelve baskets.



   Matthew 14:13. When Jesus heard it. John, who relates the same
   narrative, does not mention the reason why Jesus crossed over to the
   opposite bank, (6: 5.) Mark and Luke differ somewhat from Matthew; for
   they describe the occasion of the journey to have been to give some
   repose to his disciples, after that they had returned from their
   embassy. But there is no contradiction here; for it is possible that he
   intended to withdraw his disciples into a desert place, in order that
   he might be more at leisure to train them for higher labors, and that,
   about the same time, an additional reason arose out of the death of
   John. Minds which were still feeble might have been terrified by the
   death of John, learning from the melancholy end of that eminent prophet
   what condition awaited them all. Certainly, as it was formerly related
   that, when John was imprisoned, Christ removed from Herod's territory,
   in order to avoid his fury for the time, so we may now infer that
   Christ, in order to keep his trembling disciples at a distance from the
   flame, withdrew into a desert place.

   How long the Apostles were employed in their first embassy it is not in
   our power to determine; for the Evangelists, as we have formerly
   remarked, either did not attend to dates, or did not observe them with
   great exactness. I think it highly probable that their commission to
   proclaim the kingdom of Christ was not confined to a single occasion,
   but that, as opportunities were offered, they either repeated their
   visit to some places, or went to others after a lapse of time. The
   words, they came together to him, I look upon as meaning that ever
   afterwards they were his constant attendants; as if the Evangelist had
   said, that they did not leave their Master so as to be individually and
   constantly employed in the ordinary office of teaching, but that,
   having discharged a temporary commission, they went back to school to
   make greater advances in learning.

   They followed him on foot out of the cities. Though Christ, who foresaw
   all things before they happened, was in no respect ignorant of what
   would take place, yet he wished, as a man, to forewarn his disciples,
   that the fact might testify the anxiety which he had about them. The
   vast crowd that had assembled shows how widely his fame was spread in
   every direction: and this left the Jews without excuse in depriving
   themselves, by their own carelessness, of the salvation which was
   offered to them; for even out of this great multitude, which was
   inflamed by a sudden zeal to follow Christ, it is evident from what is
   stated by John, (6:66, 12:37) that not more than a very small number
   yielded a true and steady adherence to his doctrine.

   14. He was moved with compassion towards them. The other two
   Evangelists, and particularly Mark, state more clearly the reason why
   this compassion (sumpatheia) was awakened in the mind of Christ. It was
   because he saw famishing souls, whom the warmth of zeal had carried
   away from their homes and led into a desert place This scarcity of
   teaching indicated a wretched state of disorder; and accordingly Mark
   says that Jesus was moved with compassion towards them, because they
   were as sheep not having a shepherd Not that, as to his Divine nature,
   he looked upon them all as sheep, but that, as man, he judged according
   to the present aspect of the case. It was no small manifestation of
   piety that they left their own homes, and flocked in crowds to the
   Prophet of God, though he purposely concealed himself from them.
   Besides, it ought to be remarked, that Christ was mindful of the
   character which he sustained; for he had been commanded to discharge
   the duties of a public teacher, and was therefore bound to look upon
   all the Jews, for the time being, as belonging to the flock of God and
   to the Church, till they withdrew from it.

   So strongly was Christ moved by this feeling of compassion, that
   though, in common with his disciples, he was fatigued and almost worn
   out by uninterrupted toil, he did not spare himself. He had endeavored
   to obtain some relaxation, and that on his own account as well as for
   the sake of his disciples; but when urgent duty calls him to additional
   labor, he willingly lays aside that private consideration, [377] and
   devotes himself to teaching the multitudes. Although he has now laid
   aside those feelings which belonged to him as a mortal man, yet there
   is no reason to doubt that he looks down from heaven on poor sheep that
   have no shepherd, provided they ask relief of their wants. Mark says,
   that he began to teach them MANY things; that is, he spent a long time
   in preaching, that they might reap some lasting advantage. Luke says,
   that he spoke to them concerning the Kingdom of God, which amounts to
   the same thing. Matthew makes no mention of any thing but miracles,
   because they were of great importance in establishing Christ's
   reputation; but it may naturally be concluded that he did not leave out
   doctrine, which was a matter of the highest importance.

   15. When the evening was drawing on. The disciples had now lost their
   object, and they see that Christ is again absorbed in teaching, while
   the multitudes are so eager to receive instruction that they do not
   think of retiring. They therefore advise that for the sake of attending
   to their bodily wants, Christ should send them away into the
   neighboring villages. He had purposely delayed till now the miracle
   which he intended to perform; first, that his disciples might consider
   it more attentively, and might thus derive from it greater advantage;
   and next, that the very circumstance of the time might convince them
   that, though he does not prevent, and even does not immediately supply,
   the wants of his people, yet he never ceases to care for them, but has
   always at hand the assistance which he affords at the very time when it
   is required.

   16. Give you to them something to eat. As a fuller exposition of this
   miracle will be found at [18]the sixth chapter of John's Gospel,
   instead of troubling my readers with a repetition of what I have said,
   I would rather send them to that exposition; but rather than pass over
   this passage entirely, I shall offer a brief recapitulation. Hitherto
   Christ had bestowed his whole attention on feeding souls, but now he
   includes within his duties as a shepherd the care even of their bodies.
   And in this way he confirms his own saying, that to those who

   seek the kingdom of God, and his righteousness,
   all other things will be added, (Matthew 6:33.)

   We have no right, indeed, to expect that Christ will always follow this
   method of supplying the hungry and thirsty with food; but it is certain
   that he will never permit his own people to want the necessaries of
   life, but will stretch out his hand from heaven, whenever he shall see
   it to be necessary to relieve their necessities. Those who wish to have
   Christ for their provider, must first learn not to long for refined
   luxuries, but to be satisfied with barley-bread.

   Christ commanded that the people should sit down in companies; and he
   did so, first, that by this arrangement of the ranks the miracle might
   be more manifest; secondly, that the number of the men might be more
   easily ascertained, and that, while they looked at each other, they
   might in their turn bear testimony to this heavenly favor. Thirdly,
   perceiving that his disciples were anxious, he intended to make trial
   of their obedience by giving them an injunction which at first sight
   appeared to be absurd; for, as no provisions were at hand, there was
   reason to wonder why Christ was making arrangements that resembled a
   feast. To the same purpose is what follows, that he gave them the
   loaves, in order that in their hands the astonishing increase might
   take place, and that they might thus be the ministers of Christ's
   divine power; for as if it had been of small importance that they
   should be eye-witnesses, Christ determined that his power should be
   handled by them. [378] Two hundred pence, according to the computation
   of Budaeus, are worth about thirty-four French livres; [379] and so
   when the disciples speak of what is sufficient for them, that every one
   of them may take a little, they calculate at the rate of a farthing for
   each individual. Forming so high an estimate of the sum of money that
   would be required to purchase bread barely sufficient for procuring a
   morsel to the people, they are entitled to no small praise for their
   obedience, when they implicitly comply with the command of Christ, and
   leave the result to his disposal.

   19. He blessed. In this passage, as in many others, blessing denotes
   thanksgiving. Now Christ has taught us, by his example, that we cannot
   partake of our food with holiness and purity, unless we express our
   gratitude to God, from whose hand it comes to us. Accordingly, Paul
   tells us, that every kind of food which God bestows upon us is
   sanctifed by the word of God and prayer, (1 Timothy 4:5;) by which he
   means, that brutal men, who do not regard by faith the blessing of God,
   and do not offer to him thanksgiving, corrupt and pollute by the filth
   of their unbelief all that is by nature pure; and, on the other hand,
   that they are corrupted and defiled by the food which they swallow,
   because to unbelievers nothing is clean. Christ has therefore laid down
   for his followers the proper manner of taking food, that they may not
   profane their own persons and the gifts of God by wicked sacrilege.

   Raising his eyes towards heaven. This expresses warm and earnest
   supplication. Not that such an attitude is at all times necessary when
   we pray, but because the Son of God did not choose to disregard the
   outward forms which are fitted to aid human weakness. It ought also to
   be taken into account, that to raise the eyes upwards is an excitement
   well fitted to arouse us from sloth, when our minds are too strongly
   fixed on the earth.

   20. And carried away what was left. The fragments that remained after
   satisfying so vast a multitude of men were more than twelve times
   larger in quantity than what was at first put into their hands, and
   this contributed not a little to the splendor of the miracle. In this
   way all came to know that the power of Christ had not only created out
   of nothing the food that was necessary for immediate use, but that, if
   it should be required, there was also provision for future wants; and,
   in a word, Christ intended that, after the miracle had been wrought, a
   striking proof of it should still remain, which, after being refreshed
   by food, they might contemplate at leisure.

   Now though Christ does not every day multiply our bread, or feed men
   without the labor of their hands or the cultivation of their fields,
   the advantage of this narrative extends even to us. If we do not
   perceive that it is the blessing of God which multiplies the corn, that
   we may have a sufficiency of food, the only obstacle is, our own
   indolence and ingratitude. That, after we have been supported by the
   annual produce, there remains seed for the following year, and that
   this could not have happened but for an increase from heaven, each of
   us would easily perceive, were he not hindered by that very depravity
   which blinds the eyes both of the mind and of the flesh, so as not to
   see a manifest work of God. Christ intended to declare that, as all
   things have been delivered into his hands by the Father, so the food
   which we eat proceeds from his grace.

   sevenpence halfpenny of our own money, une livre Parisis must have been

   Matthew 14:22-33; Mark 6:45-52

   Matthew 14:22-33

   Mark 6:45-52

   22. And immediately Jesus constrained his disciples to embark, and to
   go before him to the opposite bank, till he had sent away the
   multitudes. 23. And when he had sent away the multitudes, he went up
   into a mountain alone to pray; and when the evening came, he was there
   alone. 24. But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with
   waves; for the wind was contrary. 25. And about the fourth watch of the
   night Jesus came to them, walking on the sea. 26. And when the
   disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, It
   is an apparition, and cried out for fear. 27. But immediately Jesus
   spoke to them, saying, Take courage; it is I, be not afraid. 28. And
   Peter replying to him said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee on
   the water. 29. And he said, Come. And when Peter had come down out of
   the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. 30. But when he
   perceived the wind to be boisterous, he was afraid; and when he began
   to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. 31. And immediately Jesus
   stretched out his hand and caught him, and said to him, O man of little
   faith, why didst thou doubt? 32. And when they had entered into the
   ship, the wind ceased. 33. Then they that were in the ship approached
   and worshipped him, saying, Truly thou art the Son of God.

   45. And immediately he constrained his disciples to embark, and to go
   before him, across the lake, to Bethsaida, while he sent away the
   multitude. 46. And when he had sent them away, he went into the
   mountain [380] to pray. 47. And when the evening came, the ship was in
   the midst of the sea, and he was alone on the land. 48. And he saw that
   they had difficulty in rowing, (for the wind was contrary to them;) and
   about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the
   sea, and intended to pass by them. 49. But when they saw him walking on
   the sea, they thought that it was an apparition, and cried out; 50. For
   they all saw him, and were alarmed. And immediately he spoke to them,
   and said to them, Take courage; it is I, be not afraid. 51. And he went
   up to them into the ship, and the wind ceased; and they were greatly
   astonished within themselves beyond measure, and wondered. 52. For they
   had not understood about the loaves; for their heart was blinded. [381]



   Matthew 14:22. And immediately Jesus constrained his disciples They
   must have been constrained; for they would never, of their own accord,
   have left him, and gone to the other side. Now in this they testify
   their great veneration for him, when, contrary to their own opinions,
   they yield to his command and obey it. And, indeed, it had an
   appearance of absurdity, that he should remain alone in a desert place,
   when night was approaching. But so much the greater commendation is due
   to the submissiveness of those who set a higher value on the authority
   of their heavenly teacher than on all that could be pleaded on the
   other side. And, indeed, we do not truly and perfectly obey God, unless
   we implicitly follow whatever he commands, though our feelings may be
   opposed to it. There is always the best reason, no doubt, for every
   thing that God does; but he often conceals it from us for a time, in
   order to instruct us not to be wise in ourselves, but to depend
   entirely on the expression of his will. And thus Christ constrained his
   disciples to cross over, in order to train them to that rule of
   obedience which I have mentioned; though there cannot be a doubt that
   he intended to prepare the way for the miracle which will immediately
   come under our consideration.

   23. He went up into a mountain alone. It is probable that the Son of
   God, who was fully aware of the tempest that was coming on, did not
   neglect the safety of his disciples in his prayers; and yet we
   naturally wonder that he did not rather prevent the danger than employ
   himself in prayer. But in discharging all the parts of his office as
   Mediator, he showed himself to be God and man, and exhibited proofs of
   both natures, as opportunities occurred. Though he had all things at
   his disposal, he showed himself to be a man by praying; and this he did
   not hypocritically, but manifested sincere and human affection towards
   us. In this manner his divine majesty was for a time concealed, but was
   afterwards displayed at the proper time.

   In going up into the mountain he consulted his convenience, that he
   might have more leisure for praying when removed from all noise. We
   know how easily the slightest interruptions destroy the ardor of
   prayer, or at least make it languish and cool. Though Christ was in no
   danger of this fault, yet he intended to warn us by his example, that
   we ought to be exceedingly careful to avail ourselves of every
   assistance for setting our minds free from all the snares of the world,
   that we may look direct towards heaven. Now in this respect solitude
   has a powerful influence, by disposing those who engage in prayer, when
   God is their only witness, to be more on their guard, to pour their
   heart into his bosom, to be more diligent in self-examination; and, in
   a word--remembering that they have to do with God--to rise above
   themselves. At the same time, it must be observed, that he did not lay
   down a fixed rule, as if we were never permitted to pray except in
   retirement; for Paul enjoins us to pray everywhere, lifting up clean
   hands, (1 Timothy 2:8;) and Christ himself sometimes prayed in presence
   of others, and even instructed his disciples to assemble together for
   offering social prayer. But that permission to pray in all places does
   not hinder them from engaging in secret prayer at proper seasons.

   24. The ship was now in the midst of the sea. The reader will find this
   narrative expounded by me at the sixth chapter of John's Gospel, and
   therefore I shall treat it more briefly here. When Christ permitted his
   disciples to be tossed about in a perilous condition, for a time, by an
   opposing storm, it was to fix their attention more powerfully on the
   assistance which he brought to them. For the adverse wind arose about
   midnight, or at least a little before it, and Christ appears about the
   fourth watch, that is, three hours before sunrise. Their arms were not
   more fatigued by rowing than their faith was shaken by grievous
   terrors. But when they were urged by strong necessity to desire the
   presence of their Master, it showed very extraordinary stupidity to be
   alarmed at his appearance as if he had been a ghost.

   For this reason Mark tells us, that their heart was blinded, and that
   they understood not about the loaves; for that miracle had given
   abundant evidence that Christ possessed divine power to assist his
   followers, and that he was careful to assist them, when necessity
   required. Justly, therefore, are they now charged with stupidity in not
   immediately recollecting that heavenly power, having beheld, on the
   preceding day, so astonishing a proof of it, which ought to have been
   still before their eyes. It is, no doubt, true, that their blameworthy
   slowness of apprehension was the reason why they were astonished; for
   they had not profited, as they ought to have done, by other and
   preceding miracles. But the principal charge brought against them is
   blindness, in allowing so recent an exhibition to fade from their
   memory, or rather in not directing their mind to the contemplation of
   Christ's divinity, of which the multiplication of the loaves was a
   sufficiently bright mirror.

   Two things are expressed by the words of Mark; first, that they did not
   properly consider the glory of Christ, which was exhibited in the
   multiplication of the loaves; and, secondly, a reason is assigned, that
   their heart was blinded. This appears to have been added, not only as
   an aggravation of their fault, but as a warning to us respecting the
   corruption of our understanding, that we may seek from the Lord new
   eyes. It certainly was a proof--as I have lately mentioned--of brutal
   ignorance, that they did not perceive the power of God, when they might
   almost feel it with their hands; but as the whole human race labors
   under the same disease, Mark purposely mentions blindness, in order to
   inform us that it is no new thing if men have their eyes closed against
   the manifest works of God, till they are enlightened from above; as
   Moses also said,

   The Lord hath not yet given thee a heart to understand, (Deuteronomy
   29:4.)

   Now though the word heart more frequently denotes the will or the seat
   of the affections, yet here, as in that passage which I have now quoted
   from Moses, it is put for the understanding.

   27. But immediately Jesus spake to them. As Christ is not known to be a
   Deliverer till he actually makes his appearance, he speaks, and desires
   his disciples to recognize him. That confidence, to which he exhorts
   them, is represented by him as founded on his presence; plainly
   implying that, since they perceive him to be present with them, there
   are abundant grounds of hope. But as terror had already overpowered
   their minds, he corrects that terror, lest it should hinder or abate
   their confidence: not that they could all at once lay aside fear and
   experience unmingled joy, but because it was necessary that the fear
   which had seized them should be allayed, that it might not destroy
   their confidence. Although to the reprobate the voice of the Son of God
   is deadly, and his presence appalling, yet the effect which they
   produce on believers is here described to us as widely different. They
   cause inward peace and strong confidence to hold the sway over our
   hearts, that we may not yield to carnal fears. But the reason why we
   are disturbed by unfounded and sudden alarms is, that our ingratitude
   and wickedness prevent us from employing as shields the innumerable
   gifts of God, which, if they were turned to proper account, would give
   us all necessary support. Now though Christ appeared at the proper time
   for rendering assistance, yet the storm did not immediately cease, till
   the disciples were more fully aroused both to desire and to expect his
   grace. And this deserves our attention, as conveying the instruction,
   that there are good reasons why the Lord frequently delays to bestow
   that deliverance which he has ready at hand.

   28. And Peter answering. The condition which he lays down shows that
   his faith was not yet fully settled. If it is thou, says he, bid me
   come to thee on the water. But he had heard Christ speak. Why then does
   he still argue with himself under doubt and perplexity? While his faith
   is so small and weak, a wish not well considered bursts into a flame.
   He ought rather to have judged of himself according to his capacity,
   and to have supplicated from Christ an increase of faith, that by its
   guidance and direction he might walk over seas and mountains. But now,
   without the wings of faith, he desires to fly at will; and though the
   voice of Christ has not its due weight in his heart, he desires that
   the waters should be firm under his feet. And yet there is no room to
   doubt that this longing sprung from a good principle; but as it
   degenerates into a faulty excess, it cannot be applauded as good.

   Hence too it happens that Peter immediately begins to smart for his
   rashness. Let believers, therefore, instructed by his example, beware
   of excessive haste. Wherever the Lord calls, we ought to run with
   alacrity; but whoever proceeds farther, will learn from the mournful
   result what it is to overleap the bounds which the Lord has prescribed.
   Yet it may be asked, Why does Christ comply with Peter's wish? for by
   so doing he seems to approve of it. But the answer is obvious. In many
   eases God promotes our interests better by refusing our requests; but
   at times he yields to us, that by experience we may be the more fully
   convinced of our own folly. In this manner, it happens every day that,
   by granting to those who believe in him more than is actually needed,
   he trains them to modesty and sober-mindedness for the future. Besides,
   this was of advantage to Peter and to the other disciples, and it is of
   advantage to us at the present day. The power of Christ shone more
   brightly in the person of Peter, when he admitted him as a companion,
   than if he had walked alone on the waters. But Peter knows, and the
   rest see plainly, that, when he does not rest with a firm faith, and
   rely on the Lord, the secret power of God, which formerly made the
   water solid, begins to disappear; and yet Christ dealt gently with him
   by not permitting him to sink entirely under the waters. [382] Both of
   these things happen to us; for as Peter was no sooner seized with fear
   than he began to sink, so the fleeting and transitory thoughts of the
   flesh immediately cause us to sink in the midst of our course of
   employments. [383] Meanwhile, the Lord indulges our weakness, and
   stretches out his hand, that the waters may not swallow us up
   altogether. It must also be observed that Peter, when he perceives the
   unhappy and painful consequences of his rashness, betakes himself to
   the mercy of Christ. And we too, though enduring just punishment, ought
   to betake ourselves to him, that he may have compassion on us, and
   bestow the aid of which we are unworthy.

   31. O man of little faith. While our Lord kindly preserves Peter, he
   does not connive at Peter's fault. Such is the object of the
   chastisement administered, when Peter is blamed for the weakness of his
   faith. But a question arises, Does every kind of fear give evidence of
   a weakness of faith? for Christ's words seem to imply that, where faith
   reigns, there is no room for doubt. [384] I reply: Christ reproves here
   that kind of doubt which was directly opposed to faith. A man may
   sometimes doubt without any fault on his part; and that is, when the
   word of the Lord does not speak with certainty on the matter. But the
   case was quite different with Peter, who had received an express
   command from Christ, and had already experienced his power, and yet
   leaves that twofold support, and falls into foolish and wicked fear.

   33. They that were in the ship. I understand these words to refer not
   only to the disciples, but to the sailors and other passengers. So then
   those who had not yet declared that he was their Master, instantly
   acknowledge that he is the Son of God, and by this term render to him
   the honor of the Messiah. Though at that time this lofty mystery was
   not generally known, how God was to be manifested in the flesh, (1
   Timothy 3:16,) yet as they had learned from the prophets, that he who
   was to be the Redeemer would be called the Son of God, those who under
   this designation proclaim the glory of Christ, declare their belief
   that he is the Christ. [385]

   Matthew 14:34-36

   Mark 6:53-56

   34. And when they had passed over, they came into the country of
   Gennesareth. 35. And when the men of that place had recognized him,
   they sent messengers into all the surrounding country, and brought to
   him all that were diseased. 36. And besought him that they might ouch
   only the fringe of his robe; and as many as touched were made whole.


   53. And when they had passed over, they came into the country of
   Gennesareth, and landed. 54. And when they had left the ship, they
   immediately knew him. [386] 55. And, running through all that country
   round about, they began to carry to him in beds those that were sick,
   wheresoever they heard that he was. 56. And to what place, soever he
   went, into villages, or into cities, or into towns, they laid the
   diseased in the streets, and besought him that they might touch only
   the fringe of his robe; and as many as touched him were healed.



   Matthew 14:34. They came into the country of Gennesareth. The
   Evangelists give that designation to the country which borrowed its
   name from the lake, though it is uncertain if it was not rather the
   name of the country that was bestowed on the lake; but that is a matter
   of little consequence. Our chief business is, to attend to the object
   which the Evangelists have in view. It is, to show that the glory of
   Christ was attested not by one or by another miracle, but that this
   part of Judea was filled with innumerable proofs of it, the report of
   which might easily be carried to Jerusalem and to other towns in every
   direction. Hence we infer, that singularly base and wicked must have
   been the ingratitude of that nation which wickedly shut its eyes from
   perceiving, and even endeavored, as far as lay in its power, to
   extinguish the brightness of the divine glory which was exhibited
   before them. Our present business is, to perceive, amidst so large an
   assemblage of miracles, the reason why Christ came, which was, that he
   might offer himself as a physician to heal all the diseases of all men
   [387] For we must bear in mind what Matthew had formerly quoted from
   the Prophet Isaiah, (53:4,) that in healing bodies he shadowed out
   something greater, namely, that he restores our souls to health, and
   that it is his peculiar office to remove spiritual diseases. [388] He
   is not now an inhabitant of the earth; but it is certain that, now that
   he is in heaven, he is authorized to bestow those favors of which he
   then exhibited a visible proof. Now as we labor under every kind of
   diseases till he heal us, let each of us not only present himself to
   him, but endeavor to bring others who need the same remedy.

   That they might touch the fringe. There is reason to believe that they
   were under the influence of some superstition, when they limited the
   grace of Christ to a touch of his robe; at least, they defrauded him of
   a part of his honor, since they did not expect any efficacy [389] to be
   derived from his bare word. But that he may not quench the smoking
   flax, (Isaiah 42:3,) he accommodates himself to their ignorance. Yet
   there is nothing here that lends countenance to the views of those who
   seek the grace of God in wood, or nails, or robes; while Scripture
   expressly declares, that we have no right to form any conception
   respecting Christ but what is spiritual and consistent with his
   heavenly glory. The weakness of those who, not knowing that Christ is
   God, desired to make a nearer approach to him, was endured for a time.
   Now that he fills heaven and earth with the sweet savor of his grace,
   we must embrace--not with hands or eyes, but by faith--the salvation
   which he offers to us from heaven.

   Matthew 15:1-9; Mark 7:1-13

   Matthew 15:1-9

   Mark 7:1-13

   1. Then scribes and Pharisees, who had come from Jerusalem, approach to
   Jesus, saying, 2. Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the
   elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. 3. But he
   answering said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of
   God on account of [390] your tradition? 4. For God commanded, saying,
   Honor thy father and mother; and, He that curseth father or mother,
   dying let him die. 5. But you say, Whosoever shall say to his father or
   mother, Whatever is a gift from me shall profit thee; and shall not
   honor his father or his mother. 6. Therefore you have annulled the
   commandment of God on account of your tradition. 7. Hypocrites, Isaiah
   hath justly prophesied concerning you, saying, 8. This people draw nigh
   to me with their mouth, and honor me with the lips; but their heart is
   far distant from me. 9. But in vain do they worship me, teaching
   doctrines, commandments of men.


   1. And the Pharisees, and some of the scribes, who had come from
   Jerusalem, assemble to him. 2. And when they saw some of his disciples
   eat bread with common, that is to say, with unwashen hands, they found
   fault. 3. For the Pharisees. and all the Jews, do not take food without
   frequently washing their hands, holding the traditions of the elders;
   4. And returning from market, they eat not till they have washed; and
   many other things are there which they have undertaken to keep, namely,
   the washings of cups, and pots, and brazen vessels, and beds. 5. Then
   the Pharisees and scribes ask him, saying, Why do not thy disciples
   walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with
   unwashen hands? 6. And he answering said to them, Well hath Isaiah
   prophesied concerning you hypocrites, as it is written, This people
   honor me with the lips, but their heart is far from me. 7. But in vain
   do they worship me, teaching doctrines, commandments of men. 8. For,
   laying aside the commandments of God, you keep a tradition of men, the
   washings of pots and cups, and many other things similar to these you
   do. 9. And he said to them, Well do you reject the commandment of God,
   that you may keep your own tradition. 10. For Moses said, Honor thy
   father and mother; and, He that curseth father or mother, dying let him
   die. 11. But you say, If a man shall say to his father and mother,
   Every Corban (that is, gift) that cometh from me shall profit thee.
   12. And you do not permit him to do any thing more to his father or his
   mother. 13. Annulling the word of God by your tradition, which you have
   delivered; and many things similar to this you do.



   Matthew 15:1. Then scribes and Pharisees. As the fault that is here
   corrected is not only common but highly dangerous, the passage is
   particularly worthy of our attention. We see the extraordinary
   insolence that is displayed by men as to the form and manner of
   worshipping God; for they are perpetually contriving new modes of
   worship, and when any one wishes to be thought wiser than others, he
   displays his ingenuity on this subject. I speak not of foreigners, but
   of the very domestics of the Church, on whom God has conferred the
   peculiar honor of declaring with their lips the rule of godliness. God
   has laid down the manner in which he wishes that we should worship him,
   and has included in his law the perfection of holiness. Yet a vast
   number of men, as if it were a light and trivial matter to obey God and
   to keep what he enjoins, collect for themselves, on every hand, many
   additions. Those who occupy places of authority bring forward their
   inventions for this purpose, as if they were in possession of something
   more perfect than the word of the Lord. This is followed by the slow
   growth of tyranny; for, when men have once assumed to themselves the
   right to issue commands, they demand a rigid adherence to their laws,
   and do not allow the smallest iota to be left out, either through
   contempt or through forgetfulness. The world cannot endure lawful
   authority, and most violently rebels against enduring the Lord's yoke,
   and yet easily and willingly becomes entangled in the snares of vain
   traditions; nay, such bondage appears to be, in the case of many, an
   object of desire. Meanwhile, the worship of God is corrupted, of which
   the first and leading principle is obedience. The authority of men is
   preferred to the command of God. Sternly, and therefore tyrannically,
   are the common people compelled to give their whole attention to
   trifles. This passage teaches us, first, that all modes of worship
   invented by men are displeasing to God, because he chooses that he
   alone shall be heard, in order to train and instruct us in true
   godliness according to his own pleasure; secondly, that those who are
   not satisfied with the only law of God, and weary themselves by
   attending to the traditions of men, are uselessly employed; thirdly,
   that an outrage is committed against God, when the inventions of men
   are so highly extolled, that the majesty of his law is almost lowered,
   or at least the reverence for it is abated.

   Scribes who had come from Jerusalem. With what design those scribes
   came to Jesus is not stated; but I think it probable that their
   attention was excited by his fame, and that they came with the desire
   of receiving instruction, provided that they should approve of him as a
   competent teacher; [391] though it is possible that they were sent to
   spy. However that may be, as they had brought their haughty disdain
   along with them, they are easily provoked by the slightest offense to
   bite or snarl at Christ. Hence we see with what difficulty those who
   are influenced by ambition and the lust of power are brought to submit
   to sound doctrine. Those especially whose attachment to ceremonies has
   been strengthened by long practice cannot endure any novelty, but
   loudly condemn every thing to which they have not been accustomed. In
   short, any thing more haughty or more disdainful than this class of men
   cannot be imagined.

   Both Evangelists mention that they were scribes and Pharisees; but
   Matthew puts the scribes first, and Mark puts them second. They convey
   the same meaning, that the scribes belonged to various sects, but that
   the Pharisees were the leaders, because they occupied an honorable
   station, and at that time held the government. That the Pharisees
   should be the first to take offense at disregard of the laws of which
   they were authors ought not to excite surprise; for, as we have said,
   though they boasted that they were expounders of the law, and though
   their name was derived from that circumstance, [392] they had corrupted
   by their inventions the purity of the word of God. All the traditions
   that then existed among the Jews had come out of their workshop; [393]
   and this was the reason why they displayed more than ordinary zeal and
   bitterness in defending them.

   2. Why do thy disciples transgress? When we speak of human traditions,
   this question has no reference to political laws, the use and object of
   which are widely different from enjoining the manner in which we ought
   to worship God. But as there are various kinds of human traditions, we
   must make some distinction among them. Some are manifestly wicked, for
   they inculcate acts of worship which are wicked and diametrically
   opposed to the word of God. Others of them mingle profane trifles with
   the worship of God, and corrupt its purity. Others, which are more
   plausible, and are not chargeable with any remarkable fault, are
   condemned on this ground., that they are imagined to be necessary to
   the worship of God; and thus there is a departure from sincere
   obedience to God alone, and a snare is laid for the conscience.

   To this last description the present passage unquestionably relates;
   for the washing of hands, on which the Pharisees insisted, could not in
   itself be charged with wicked superstition; otherwise Christ would not
   have permitted the water-pots to be used at the marriage, (John 2:6,)
   if it had not been an allowable ceremony; but the fault lay in this,
   that they did not think that God could be properly worshipped in any
   other way. It was not without a specious pretext that the practice of
   washings was first introduced. We know how rigidly the Law of God
   demands outward cleanness; not that the Lord intended that this should
   occupy the whole attention of his servants, but that they might be more
   careful to guard against every spiritual defilement. But in washings
   the Law preserved some moderation. Next came teachers, who thought that
   they would not be reckoned sufficiently acute, if they did not make
   some appendage to the word of God; [394] and hence arose washings of
   which no mention was made in the Law. The legislators themselves did
   not give out that they delivered any thing new, [395] but only that
   they administered cautions, which would be of service to assist in
   keeping the Law of God. But this was immediately followed by great
   abuse, when ceremonies introduced by men began to be regarded as a part
   of divine worship; and again, when in matters that were free and
   voluntary uniformity was absolutely enjoined. For it was always the
   will of God, as we have already said, that he should be worshipped
   according to the rule laid down in his word, and therefore no addition
   to his Law can be endured. Now as he permits believers to have outward
   ceremonies, by means of which they may perform the exercises of
   godliness, so he does not suffer them to mix up those ceremonies with
   his own word, as if religion consisted in them. [396]

   For they wash not their hands. The ground of offense is explained more
   fully by Mark; but the substance of his explanation is, that many
   things were practiced by the scribes, which they had voluntarily
   undertaken to keep. They were secondary laws invented by the curiosity
   of men, as if the plain command of God were not enough. God commanded
   that those who had contracted any defilement should wash themselves,
   (Leviticus 11:25,28;) and this extended to cups, and pots, and raiment,
   and other articles of household furniture, (Leviticus 11:32,) that they
   might not touch any thing that was polluted or unclean. But to invent
   other ablutions was idle and useless. [397] They were not destitute of
   plausibility, as Paul tells us that the inventions of men have an
   appearance of wisdom, (Colossians 2:23;) but if they had rested in the
   Law of God alone, that modesty would have been more agreeable to Him
   than solicitude about small matters.

   They were desirous to warn a person not to take food while he was
   unclean, through want of consideration; but the Lord reckoned it enough
   to wash away those defilements of which they were aware. Besides, no
   end or limit could be set to such cautions; for they could scarcely
   move a finger without contracting some new spot or stain. But a far
   worse abuse lay in this, that the consciences of men were tormented
   with scruples which led them to regard every person as chargeable with
   pollution, who did not on every occasion wash his body with water. In
   persons who belonged to a private rank they would perhaps have
   overlooked the neglect of this ceremony; but as they had expected from
   Christ and his disciples something uncommon and extraordinary, they
   reckoned it unbecoming that ceremonies, which were traditions of the
   elders, and the practice of which was held sacred by the scribes,
   should not be observed by the disciples of a master who undertook to
   reform the existing state of things.

   It is a great mistake to compare the sprinkling of the water of
   purification, or, as the Papists call it, blessed water, with the
   Jewish washing; for, by repeating so frequently the one baptism, [398]
   Papists do all that is in their power to efface it. Besides, this
   absurd sprinkling is used for exorcising. [399] But if it were lawful
   in itself, and were not accompanied by so many abuses, still we must
   always condemn the urgency with which they demand it as if it were
   indispensable.

   3. Why do you also transgress? There are here two answers that are
   given by Christ, the former of which is addressed, as we say, to the
   person; while the latter decides as to the fact and the question in
   hand. Mark inverts that order; for he first represents Christ as
   speaking on the whole subject, and afterwards adds the reproof which is
   directed against hypocrites. We shall follow the narrative of Matthew.
   When the Lord, in his turn, puts the question to the scribes why they
   break the Law of God on account of their traditions, he does not as yet
   pronounce a direct acquittal of his disciples from the crime charged
   against them; but only points out how improper and unwarrantable is
   this readiness to take offense. They are displeased when the
   commandments of men are not observed with exactness; and how much more
   criminal is it to spend the whole time in observing them, to the
   disregard of the law of God? It is manifest, therefore, that their
   wrath is kindled rather by ambition than by a proper kind of zeal, when
   they thus prefer men to God.

   When he says that they transgress the commandments of God, the meaning
   of the expression is easily learned from the context. They did not
   openly or professedly set aside the law of God, so as to look upon any
   thing as lawful which the law had forbidden; but there was an indirect
   transgression of it, for they permitted duties which God had enjoined
   to be neglected with impunity. A plain and familiar instance is adduced
   by Christ. The commandment of God is, that children shall honor their
   parents, (Exodus 20:12.) Now as the sacred offerings yielded emolument
   to the priests, the observance of them was so rigidly enforced, that
   men were taught to regard it as a more heinous sin not to make a
   free-will offering than to defraud a parent of what was justly due to
   him. In short, what the Law of God declared to be voluntary was, in the
   estimation of the scribes, of higher value than one of the most
   important of the commandments of God. Whenever we are so eager to keep
   the laws of men as to bestow less care and attention on keeping the law
   of God itself, we are held as transgressing it. Shortly afterwards he
   says, that they had annulled the commandment of God on account of the
   traditions of men; for the scribes led the people to entertain so
   strong an attachment to their own injunctions, that they did not allow
   them leisure to attend to the word of God. Again, as they reckoned
   those persons to have discharged their duty well who obeyed these
   injunctions to the letter, hence arose a liberty to commit sin; for
   whenever holiness is made to consist in any thing else than in
   observing the Law of God, men are led to believe that the law may be
   violated without danger.

   Let any man now consider whether this wickedness does not at present
   abound more among the Papists than it formerly did among the Jews. It
   is not indeed denied by the Pope, or by the whole of his filthy clergy,
   that we ought to obey God; but when we come to the point, we find that
   they consider the act of eating a morsel of flesh as nothing less than
   a capital crime, while theft or fornication is regarded as a venial
   fault, and thus, on account of their traditions, they overturn the Law
   of God; for it is utterly insufferable that the enactments of men shall
   withdraw any part of that obedience which is due to God alone. Besides,
   the honor which God commands to be yielded to parents extends to all
   the duties of filial piety. [400] The latter clause which Christ adds,
   that he who curseth father or mother deserves to be put to death, is
   intended to inform us, that it is no light or unimportant precept to
   honor parents, since the violation of it is so severely punished. And
   this is no small aggravation of the guilt of the scribes, that so
   severe a threatening does not terrify them from granting an extension
   of liberty to those who despised their parents.

   5. But you say, etc. The mode of expression is defective, and is more
   fully exhibited by Mark, who adds, you suffer them not to do anything
   more to their father or to their mother The meaning is, that the
   scribes were altogether wrong in acquitting those persons who fail to
   perform their duties to their parents, provided that this deficiency be
   supplied, on their part, by a voluntary sacrifice, which might have
   been omitted without offending God. For we must not understand Christ's
   words to bear that the scribes had forbidden men to render all proper
   obedience; [401] but they were so eager to pursue their own gain, that
   children were allowed, in the meantime, to neglect their duties to
   their parents.

   7. Well hath Isaiah prophesied concerning you. Our Lord now proceeds
   farther; for he decides on the question in hand, which he divides into
   two clauses. The first is, that they relied on outward ceremonies
   alone, and set no value on true holiness, which consists in sincere
   uprightness of heart; and the second is, that they worshipped God in a
   wrong way, according to their own fancy. Now though his reproof of
   pretended and hypocritical holiness appears hitherto to be restricted
   to persons, yet it includes the substance of this doctrine, from which
   the full conclusion was, first, that the worship of God is spiritual,
   and does not consist in the sprinkling of water, or in any other
   ceremony; and, secondly, that there is no reasonable worship of God but
   what is directed by the rule of his word. Although Isaiah (29:13) did
   not prophesy for futurity alone, but had regard to the men of his own
   age, yet Christ says that this prediction relates to the Pharisees and
   scribes, because they resemble those ancient hypocrites with whom the
   prophet had to contend. Christ does not quote that passage exactly as
   it stands; but the prophet expressly mentions two offenses by which the
   Jews provoked against themselves the divine vengeance. With their lips
   only, and by an outward profession, they made a pretense of godliness;
   and, next, they turned aside to modes of worship invented by men.
   First, then, it is wicked hypocrisy, when the honor which men render to
   God is only in outward appearance; for to approach to God with the
   mouth, and to honor him with the lips, would not be in itself evil,
   provided that the heart went before. The substance of what our Lord
   states on this subject is, that, since the worship of God is spiritual,
   and as nothing pleases him that is not accompanied by the inward
   sincerity of the heart, they who make holiness to consist in outward
   display are hypocrites.

   9. But in vain do they worship me The words of the prophet run
   literally thus: their fear toward me has been taught by the precept of
   men. But Christ has faithfully and accurately given the meaning, that
   in vain is God worshipped, when the will of men is substituted in the
   room of doctrine. By these words, all kinds of will-worship,
   (ethelothzeskeia,) as Paul calls it, (Colossians 2:23,) are plainly
   condemned. For, as we have said, since God chooses to be worshipped in
   no other way than according to his own appointment, he cannot endure
   new modes of worship to be devised. As soon as men allow themselves to
   wander beyond the limits of the Word of God, the more labor and anxiety
   they display in worshipping him, the heavier is the condemnation which
   they draw down upon themselves; for by such inventions religion is
   dishonored.

   Teaching doctrines, commandments of men In these words there is what is
   called apposition; [402] for Christ declares them to be mistaken who
   bring forward, in the room of doctrine, the commandments of men, or who
   seek to obtain from them the rule for worshipping God. Let it therefore
   be held as a settled principle, that, since obedience is more highly
   esteemed by God than sacrifices, (1 Samuel 15:22,23,) all kinds of
   worship invented by men are of no estimation in his sight; nay more,
   that, as the prophet declares, they are accursed and detestable.

   Luke 6:39

   10. And having called the multitudes to him, he said to them, Hear and
   understand. 11. What entereth into the mouth polluteth not the man, but
   what goes out of the mouth polluteth the man. 12. Then his disciples
   approaching said to him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended
   when they heard that saying? 13. But he answering, said, Every plant
   which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up. 14. Let
   them alone: they are blind leaders of the blind. And if a blind man
   shall lead a blind man, both will fall into the ditch. 15. And Peter
   answering said to him, Explain to us that parable. 16. And Jesus said,
   Are you also still void of understanding? 17. Do you not yet understand
   that whatever entereth into the mouth passeth into the belly, and is
   thrown into the sink? 18. But those things which proceed out of the
   mouth come from the heart itself, and they pollute the man. 19. For our
   of the heart proceed wicked thoughts, murders, adulteries,
   fornications, thefts, false testimonies, calumnies. 20. These are the
   things which pollute the man. But to take food with unwashed hands
   polluteth not the man.

   14. And when he had called to him the whole multitude, he said to them,
   Listen to me, all of you, and understand. 15. There is nothing from
   without a man which, entering into him, can pollute him; but those
   things which come out of a man are the things which pollute a man.
   16. If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. 17. And when he had
   entered into the house, and withdrawn from the multitude, his disciples
   asked him concerning the parable. 18. And he saith to them, Are you
   also void of understanding? Do you not yet understand that whatsoever
   entereth into a man from without cannot pollute him? 19. Because it
   entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the
   sink, purifying all the food? 20. And he said, It is what goeth out of
   a man that polluteth him. 21. For from within, out of the heart of man
   proceed wicked thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, 22. Thefts,
   evil desires, frauds, deceit, wantonness, an evil eye, calumnies,
   pride, foolishness: 23. All these evil things proceed from within, and
   pollute the man.


   39. And he spoke a parable to them, [403] Can a blind man lead a blind
   man? Will not both fall into the ditch?



   Matthew 15:10. And having called the multitudes to him. Here Christ
   turns [404] to those who are ready to receive instruction, and explains
   more fully the truth at which he had formerly glanced, that the kingdom
   of God does not consist in meat and drink, as Paul also teaches us,
   (Romans 14:17;) for, since outward things are by nature pure, the use
   of them is free and pure, and uncleanness is not contracted from the
   good creatures of God. It is therefore a general statement, that
   pollution does not come from without into a man, but that the fountain
   is concealed within him. Now when he says that all the evil actions
   which any man performs come out of the mouth of man, he employs a
   synecdoche; [405] for he says so by way of allusion to the subject in
   hand, and conveys this instruction, that we do not draw uncleanness
   into our mouth along with meat and drink, but that every kind of
   defilement proceeds from ourselves.

   Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended? As the scribes were
   presumptuous and rebellious, Christ did not take great pains to pacify
   them, but satisfied himself with repelling their hypocrisy and pride.
   The offense which they had formerly taken up was doubled, when they
   perceived that--not through oversight, but seemingly on purpose--Christ
   despised their washings as trifles. Now when Christ did not hesitate to
   inflame still more, by keen provocation, wicked and malicious persons,
   let us learn from his example, that we ought not to be exceedingly
   solicitous to please every one by what we say and do. His disciples,
   however--as is usually the case with ignorant and unlearned people--no
   sooner perceive the result to be unfavorable, than they conclude that
   Christ's reply had been unseasonable and improper. [406] For the object
   of their advice was, to persuade Christ to soothe the rage of the
   Pharisees by softening the harsh expression which he had employed.
   [407]

   It almost always happens with weak persons, that they form an
   unfavorable judgment about a doctrine, as soon as they find that it is
   regarded with doubt or meets with opposition. And certainly it were to
   be wished, that it should give no offense, but receive the calm
   approbation of all; but, as the minds of many are blinded, and even
   their hearts are kindled into rage, by Satan, and as many souls are
   held under the benumbing influence of brutal stupidity, it is
   impossible that all should relish the true doctrine of salvation. Above
   all, we ought not to be surprised to behold the rage of those who
   inwardly nourish the venom of malice and obstinacy. Yet we ought to
   take care that, so far as may be in our power, our manner of teaching
   shall give no offense; but it would be the height of madness to think
   of exercising greater moderation than we have been taught to do by our
   heavenly Master. We see how his discourse was made an occasion of
   offense by wicked and obstinate men; and we see at the same time, how
   that kind of offense which arose from malignity was treated by him with
   contempt.

   13. Every plant. As the indifferent success of the doctrine had wounded
   their weak minds, Christ intended to remedy this evil. Now the remedy
   which he proposes is, that good men ought not to be distressed, or
   entertain less reverence for the doctrine, though to many it be an
   occasion of death. It is a mistaken view of this passage which some
   have adopted, that all the inventions of men, and every thing that has
   not proceeded from the mouth of God, must be rooted up and perish; for
   it was rather to men that Christ referred, and the meaning is, that
   there is no reason to wonder if the doctrine of salvation shall prove
   deadly to the reprobate, because they are always carried headlong to
   the destruction to which they are doomed.

   By the persons that have been planted by the hand of God we are to
   understand those who, by his free adoption, have been ingrafted into
   the tree of life, as Isaiah also, when speaking of the Church renewed
   by the grace of God, calls it a branch planted by the Lord, (Isaiah
   60:21.) Now as salvation depends solely on the election of God, the
   reprobate must perish, in whatever way this may be effected; not that
   they are innocent, and free from all blame, when God destroys them, but
   because, by their own malice, they turn to their destruction all that
   is offered to them, however salutary it may be. To those who willingly
   perish the Gospel thus becomes, as Paul assures us, the savor of death
   unto death, (2 Corinthians 2:16;) for, though it is offered to all for
   salvation, it does not yield this fruit in any but the elect. It
   belongs to a faithful and honest teacher to regulate every thing which
   he brings forward by a regard to the advantage of all; but whenever the
   result is different, let us take comfort from Christ's reply. It is
   beautifully expressed by the parable, that the cause of perdition does
   not lie in the doctrine, but that the reprobate who have no root in
   God, when the doctrine is presented to them, throw out their hidden
   venom, and thus accelerate that death to which they were already
   doomed.

   Which my heavenly Father hath not planted. Hypocrites, who appear for a
   time to have been planted like good trees, are particularly described
   by Christ; for Epicureans, who are noted for open and shameful contempt
   of God, cannot properly be said to resemble trees, but the description
   must be intended to apply to those who have acquired celebrity by some
   vain appearance of godliness. Such were the scribes, who towered in the
   Church of God like the cedars in Lebanon, and whose revolt might on
   that account appear the more strange. Christ might have said that it is
   right that those should perish who disdainfully reject salvation; but
   he rises higher, and asserts that no man will remain steadfast, unless
   his salvation be secured by the election of God. By these words he
   expressly declares, that the first origin of our salvation flows from
   that grace by which God elected us to be his children before we were
   created.

   14. Let them alone. He sets them aside as unworthy of notice, and
   concludes that the offense which they take ought not to give us much
   uneasiness. Hence has arisen the distinction, of which we hear so much,
   about avoiding offenses, that we ought to beware of offending the weak,
   but if any obstinate and malicious person take offense, we ought not to
   be uneasy; for, if we determined to satisfy all obstinate people, we
   must bury Christ, who is the stone of offense, (1 Peter 2:8.) Weak
   persons, who are offended through ignorance, and afterwards return to
   just views, must be distinguished from haughty and disdainful men who
   are themselves the authors of offenses. It is of importance to attend
   to this distinction, in order that no one who is weak may be distressed
   through our fault. But when wicked men dash themselves through their
   obstinacy, let us walk on unmoved in the midst of offenses; for he who
   spares not weak brethren tramples, as it were, under foot those to whom
   we are commanded to stretch out the hand. It would be idle to attend to
   others, whom we cannot avoid offending, if we wish to keep the right
   path; and when, under the pretext of taking offense, they happen to
   fall off and revolt from Christ, we must let them alone, that they may
   not drag us along with them. [408]

   They are blind leaders of the blind. Christ means that all who allow
   themselves to be driven hither and thither at the disposal of those men
   will miserably perish; for when they stumble on a plain road, it is
   evident that they are willfully blind. Why then should any one allow
   himself to be directed by them, except that he might fall into the same
   ditch? Now Christ, who has risen upon us as the Sun of righteousness,
   (Malachi 4:2,) and not only points out the road to us by the torch of
   his Gospel, but desires that we should keep it before us, justly calls
   on his disciples to shake off that slothfulness, and not to wander, as
   it were, in the dark, for the sake of gratifying the blind. [409] Hence
   also we infer that all who, under the pretense of simplicity or
   modesty, give themselves up to be deceived or ensnared by errors, are
   without excuse.

   Luke 6:39. And he spake to them a parable. Luke relates this saying
   without mentioning any occurrence, but states generally, that Christ
   made use of this parable; as in recording many of Christ's discourses
   he says nothing as to the occasion on which they were delivered. It is
   no doubt possible that Christ may have spoken this parable more than
   once; but, as no place more appropriate was to be found, I have not
   hesitated to insert here what Luke relates without fixing the time.

   Matthew 15:15. And Peter answering said. As the disciples betray
   excessive ignorance, Christ justly reproves and upbraids them for being
   still void of understanding, and yet does not fail to act as their
   teacher. What Matthew ascribes in a peculiar manner to Peter is related
   by Mark, in the same sense, as a question put by them all; and this is
   evident from Christ's reply, in which he reproves the ignorance, not of
   Peter only, but of all of them alike. The general meaning is, that men
   are not polluted by food, but that they have within themselves the
   pollution of sins, which afterwards shows itself in the outward
   actions. Is it objected that intemperance in eating is defilement? The
   solution is easy. Christ speaks only of the proper and lawful use of
   those things which God has put in our power. To eat and drink are
   things in their own nature free and indifferent: if any corruption be
   added, it proceeds from the man himself, and therefore must be regarded
   not as external, but internal. [410]

   19. For out of the heart proceed wicked thoughts Hence we infer that
   the word mouth, as I have mentioned, was used by Christ in a former
   verse by way of allusion to the context; for now he makes no mention of
   the mouth, but merely says that out of the heart of man proceeds all
   that is sinful and that corrupts by its pollution. Mark differs from
   Matthew in this respect, that he gives a larger catalogue of sins, such
   as lusts, or irregular desires. The Greek word (pleonexiai) is by some
   rendered covetousness; but I have preferred to take it in a general
   acceptation. Next come fraud and intemperance, and those which
   immediately follow. Though the mode of expression be figurative, it is
   enough to understand Christ's meaning to be, that all sins proceed from
   the wicked and corrupt affections of the heart. To say that an evil eye
   proceeds from the heart is not strictly accurate, but it involves
   nothing that is absurd or ambiguous; for it means, that an unholy heart
   pollutes the eyes by making them the ministers, or organs, of wicked
   desires. And yet Christ does not speak as if every thing that is evil
   in man were confined to open sins; but, in order to show more clearly
   that the heart of man is the abode of all evils, [411] he says that the
   proofs and results appear in the sins themselves.

   And pollute the man. Instead of the verb pollute, the Greek term is
   koinoi, make common; as Mark, a little before, (7:2,) used the phrase,
   koinais chersi, with common hands, for with unclean hands. [412] It is
   a Hebrew phrase; [413] for, since God had set apart the Jews on the
   condition that they should separate themselves from all the pollutions
   of the Gentiles, everything that was inconsistent with this holiness
   was called common, that is, profane.

   Matthew 15:21-28; Mark 7:24-30

   Matthew 15:21-28

   Mark 7:24-30

   21. And Jesus departing thence withdrew into the territories of Tyre
   and Sidon. 22. And, lo, a woman of Canaan, who had come from those
   territories, cried saying, Have compassion on me, O Lord, thou son of
   David; my daughter is grievously afflicted by a devil. 23. But he made
   no reply to her, and his disciples approaching implored him, saying,
   Send her away; for she crieth after us. 24. But he answering said, I am
   not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 25. And she came
   and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. 26. But he answering said,
   It is not seemly to take the children's bread, and throw it to the
   dogs. 27. But she said, Certainly, O Lord; yet the dogs eat of the
   crumbs that fall from the table of their masters. 28. Then Jesus
   answering said to her, O woman, great is thy faith; be it to thee as
   thou desirest. And her daughter was cured from that time. [414]

   24. And he arose and departed thence into the borders of Tyre and
   Sidon; and, entering into a house, he wished that no man should know
   it, but he could not be concealed. 25. For a woman, whose daughter had
   an unclean spirit, no sooner heard of him than she came and fell at his
   feet, 26. (For the woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by birth,) and
   implored him to cast the devil out of her daughter. 27. And Jesus said
   to her, Allow the children to be first satisfied; for it is not seemly
   to take the children's bread, and throw it to the dogs. 28. But she
   replied and said to him, Certainly, O Lord; for even the dogs [415]
   under the table eat of the children's crumbs. 29. And he said to her,
   On account of that saying go away, the devil is gone out of thy
   daughter. 30. And when she had gone to her own house, she found that
   the devil had gone out, and her daughter lying on the bed.



   In this miracle we are informed in what manner the grace of Christ
   began to flow to the Gentiles; for, though the full time was not yet
   come when Christ would make himself known to the whole world, yet he
   intended to give some early manifestations of the common mercy which
   was at length offered indiscriminately to Jews and Gentiles after his
   resurrection. A remarkable picture of faith is presented to us in the
   woman of Canaan, for the purpose of instructing us by means of
   comparison, that the Jews were justly deprived of the promised
   redemption, since their impiety was so shameful.

   The woman, whom Matthew describes as of Canaan, is said by Mark to have
   been a Greek, and a Syrophenician by birth But there is no
   contradiction here; for we know that it was the prevailing custom among
   the Jews to call all foreign nations Greeks, and hence that contrast
   between Greeks and Jews, which occurs so frequently in the writings of
   Paul. As she was a native of the territories of Tyre and Sidon, we need
   not wonder that she is called a Syrophenician; for that country was
   called Syria, and formed part of Phenicia. The Jews disdainfully gave
   the name of Canaanites to all the inhabitants of that district; and it
   is probable that the majority of them were descended from the tribes of
   Canaan, who when banished from their native country, fled to a sort of
   retreat in the neighborhood. Both agree in this point, that the woman
   was a native of a heathen nation, that she had not been instructed in
   the doctrine of the law, and that she came of her own accord to Christ,
   humbly to entreat his aid.

   Mark 7:24. He wished that no man should know it. We must attend to this
   circumstance, which is mentioned by Mark, that when Christ came to that
   place, he did not erect his banner, but endeavored to remain concealed
   for a time, in that obscure situation, like a private individual. Mark
   speaks according to the ordinary perception of the flesh; for, although
   Christ by his divine Spirit foresaw what would happen, yet so far as he
   was the minister and ambassador of the Father, he kept himself, as his
   human nature might have led us to expect, within the limits of that
   calling which God had given him; and in that respect it is said that
   what he wished, as man, he was unable to accomplish. Meanwhile, this
   occurrence, as I have said, tends powerfully to condemn the Jews,
   who--though they boasted that they were the heirs of the covenant of
   the Lord, his peculiar people, and a royal priesthood--were blind and
   deaf when Christ, with a loud voice and with the addition of miracles,
   offered to them the promised redemption; while this woman, who had no
   relationship with the children of Abraham, and to whom, at first sight,
   the covenant did not at all belong, came of her own accord to Christ,
   without having heard his voice or seen his miracles.

   Matthew 15:22. Have compassion on me, O Lord. Though this woman was an
   alien, and did not belong to the Lord's flock, yet she had acquired
   some taste of piety; [416] for, without some knowledge of the promises,
   she would not have called Christ the Son of David. The Jews indeed had
   almost entirely departed, or at least had greatly turned aside, from
   the pure and sound doctrine of the Gospel; but a report of the promised
   redemption was extensively prevalent. As the restoration of the Church
   depended on the reign of David, whenever they spoke of the Messiah, it
   was customary for them to employ the name, Son of David; and indeed
   this confession was heard from the lips of all. But when the true faith
   had died out amongst them, it was an amazing and incredible display of
   the goodness of God that the sweet savor of the promises reached the
   neighboring nations. Though this woman had not been regularly educated
   by any teacher, yet her faith in Christ was not a notion adopted by her
   at random, but was formed out of the law and the prophets. It was
   therefore not less absurd than wicked in that dog, Servetus, to abuse
   this example for the purpose of proving that faith may exist without
   promises. I do not deny that, in this sense, there may sometimes be a
   sort of implicit faith, that is, a faith which is not accompanied by a
   full and distinct knowledge of sound doctrine; provided we also hold
   that faith always springs from the word of God, and takes its origin
   from true principles, and therefore is always found in connection with
   some light of knowledge.

   23. But he made no reply to her. In various ways the Evangelists bestow
   commendation on the faith of this woman. Here they bring before us her
   unshaken constancy; for the silence of Christ was a sort of refusal,
   and there is reason to wonder that she was not cast down by this trial,
   but her continuance in prayer was a proof of her perseverance. This
   appears, however, to be inconsistent with the nature of faith and of
   calling upon God, as it is described by Paul, who assures us that no
   man can pray aright till he has heard the word of God.

   How shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
   and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
   (Romans 10:14.)

   Who then will say that this woman had faith, who takes courage from her
   own feelings, though Christ is silent? But as Christ has two ways of
   speaking and of being silent, it must be observed, that though he
   withheld at that time the words of his mouth, yet he spoke within to
   the mind of the woman, and so this secret inspiration was a substitute
   for the outward preaching. Besides, her prayer arose out of the hearing
   of faith, (Romans 10:17;) and, therefore, though Christ does not
   immediately reply, she continually hears the sound of that doctrine
   [417] which she had already learned, that Christ came as a Redeemer. In
   this way the Lord often acts towards those who believe in him; he
   speaks to them, and yet is silent. Relying on the testimonies of
   Scripture, where they hear him speaking, they firmly believe that he
   will be gracious to them; and yet he does not immediately reply to
   their wishes and prayers, but, on the contrary, seems as if he did not
   hear. We see then that the design of Christ's silence was not to
   extinguish the woman's faith, but rather to whet her zeal and inflame
   her ardor. But if a small seed of doctrine in a woman of Canaan yielded
   such abundant fruit, it ill becomes us to be dejected, if at any time
   he delays and does not immediately grant a favorable answer.

   Send her away. The disciples present no request in favor of the woman,
   but as they are annoyed by her importunity, they desire that, in some
   way or other, she may be dismissed. It is a childish contrivance, which
   the Papists have endeavored to support by means of this passage, that
   departed saints are allowed to plead for us; for, granting that this
   woman solicited the disciples to give her some favor or assistance --
   which, however, cannot be proved from the passage -- still there is a
   wide difference between the dead and living. It must be also observed,
   that, if they really intended to aid her by their advocacy, they obtain
   nothing.

   24. I am not sent. He informs the Apostles that his reason for refusing
   the woman of Canaan arises out of his desire to devote himself entirely
   to the Jews to whom alone he was appointed to be a minister of the
   grace of God. He argues from the call and the command of the Father,
   that he must not yield any assistance to strangers; not that the power
   of Christ was always confined within so narrow limits, but because
   present circumstances rendered it necessary that he should begin with
   the Jews, and at that time devote himself to them in a peculiar manner.
   For as I have said in expounding Matthew 10:5, the middle wall of
   partition (Ephesians 2:14) was not thrown down till after Christ's
   resurrection that he might proclaim peace to the nations which were
   aliens from the kingdom of God: and therefore he prohibited the
   Apostles, at that time, from scattering anywhere but in Judea the first
   seed of doctrine. Justly therefore, does he affirm that, on this
   occasion, he was sent to the Jews only, till the Gentiles also followed
   in the proper order.

   To the lost sheep of the house of Israel. He bestows the designation of
   sheep of the house of Israel not on the elect only, but on all who were
   descended from the holy fathers; for the Lord had included all in the
   covenant, and was promised indiscriminately to all as a Redeemer, as he
   also revealed and offered himself to all without exception. It is
   worthy of observation, that he declares himself to have been sent to
   LOST sheep, as he assures us in another passage that he came to save
   that which was lost, (Matthew 18:11.) Now as we enjoy this favor, at
   the present day, in common with the Jews, we learn what our condition
   is till he appear as our Savior.

   25. And she came and worshipped him. We might be apt to think that this
   woman contends with some measure of obstinacy, as if she would extort
   something from Christ in spite of him; but there is no reason to doubt
   that she was animated by the conviction which she entertained as to the
   kindness of the Messiah. When Christ expressly declared that it did not
   belong to his office, she was not intimidated by that refusal, and did
   not desist from her purpose. The reason was, that she adhered firmly to
   that previous sentiment of faith which I have mentioned, and admitted
   nothing that was opposed to her hope. And this is the sure test of
   faith, that we do not suffer that general commencement of our
   salvation, which is founded on the word of God, to be in any way torn
   from us.

   26. It is not seemly. Christ's reply is harsher than ever, and one
   would think that he intended by it to cut off all hope; for not only
   does he declare that all the grace which he has received from the
   Father belongs to the Jews, and must be bestowed on them, otherwise
   they will be defrauded of their just rights; but he disdainfully
   compares the woman herself to a dog, thus implying that she is unworthy
   of being a partaker of his grace. To make the meaning plain to us, it
   must be understood that the appellation of the children's bread is here
   given, not to the gifts of God of whatever description, but only to
   those which were bestowed in a peculiar manner on Abraham and his
   posterity. For since the beginning of the world, the goodness of God
   was everywhere diffused--nay, filled heaven and earth--so that all
   mortal men felt that God was their Father. But as the children of
   Abraham had been more highly honored than the rest of mankind, the
   children's bread is a name given to everything that, relates peculiarly
   to the adoption by which the Jews alone were elected to be children The
   light of the sun, the breath of life, and the productions of the soil,
   were enjoyed by the Gentiles equally with the Jews; but the blessing
   which was to be expected in Christ dwelt exclusively in the family of
   Abraham. To lay open without distinction that which God had conferred
   as a peculiar privilege on a single nation, was nothing short of
   setting aside the covenant of God; for in this way the Jews, who ought
   to have the preference, were placed on a level with the Gentiles.

   And to throw it to the dogs. By using the word throw, Christ intimates
   that what is taken from the Church of God and given to heathens is not
   well bestowed. But this must be restricted to that time when it was in
   Judea only that men called on God; for, since the Gentiles were
   admitted to partake of the same salvations--which took place when
   Christ diffused everywhere the light of his Gospel--the distinction was
   removed, and those who were formerly dogs are now reckoned among the
   children. The pride of the flesh must fall down, when we learn that by
   nature we are dogs At first, no doubt, human nature, in which the image
   of God brightly shone, occupied so high a station that this opprobrious
   epithet did not apply to all nations, and even to kings, on whom God
   confers the honor of bearing his name. [418] But the treachery and
   revolt of Adam made it proper that the Lord should send to the stable,
   along with dogs, those who through the guilt of our first parent became
   bastards; more especially when a comparison is made between the Jews,
   who were exempted from the common lot, and the Gentiles, who were
   banished from the kingdom of God.

   Christ's meaning is more fully unfolded by Mark, who gives these words,
   Allow the children first to be satisfied He tells the woman of Canaan
   that she acts presumptuously in proceeding -- as it were, in the midst
   of the supper -- to seize on what was on the table. [419] His chief
   design was, to make trial of the woman's faith; but he also pointed out
   the dreadful vengeance that would overtake the Jews, who rejected an
   inestimable benefit which was freely offered to them, and which they
   refused to those who sought it with warmth and earnestness.

   27. Certainly, Lord. The woman's reply showed that she was not hurried
   along by a blind or thoughtless impulse to offer a flat contradiction
   [420] to what Christ had said. As God preferred the Jews to other
   nations, she does not dispute with them the honor of adoption, and
   declares, that she has no objection whatever that Christ should satisfy
   them according to the order which God had prescribed. She only asks
   that some crumbs -- falling, as it were, accidentally -- should come
   within the reach of the dogs And at no time, certainly, did God shut up
   his grace among the Jews in such a manner as not to bestow a small
   taste of them on the Gentiles. No terms could have been employed that
   would have described more appropriately, or more justly, that
   dispensation of the grace of God which was at that time in full
   operation.

   28. Great is thy faith. He first applauds the woman's faith, and next
   declares, that on account of her faith he grants her prayer. The
   greatness of her faith appeared chiefly in this respect, that by the
   aid of nothing more than a feeble spark of doctrine, she not only
   recognized the actual office of Christ, and ascribed to him heavenly
   power, but pursued her course steadily through formidable opposition;
   suffered herself to be annihilated, provided that she held by her
   conviction that she would not fail to obtain Christ's assistance; and,
   in a word, so tempered her confidence with humility, that, while she
   advanced no unfounded claim, neither did she shut against her the
   fountain of the grace of Christ, by a sense of her own unworthiness.
   This commendation, bestowed on a woman who had been a heathen, [421]
   condemns the ingratitude of that nation which boasted that it was
   consecrated to God.

   But how can the woman be said to believe aright, who not only receives
   no promise from Christ, but is driven back by his declaration to the
   contrary? On that point I have already spoken. Though he appears to
   give a harsh refusal to her prayers, yet, convinced that God would
   grant the salvation which he had promised through the Messiah, she
   ceases not to entertain favorable hopes; and therefore she concludes,
   that the door is shut against her, not for the purpose of excluding her
   altogether, but that, by a more strenuous effort of faith, she may
   force her way, as it were, through the chinks. Be it unto thee as thou
   desirest. This latter clause contains a useful doctrine, that faith
   will obtain anything from the Lord; for so highly does he value it,
   that he is always prepared to comply with our wishes, so far as it may
   be for our advantage.

   Matthew 15:29-39

   Mark 7:31-37

   29. And Jesus departing thence, came near the sea of Galilee, and he
   went up into the mountain, and sat down there. 30. And great multitudes
   came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the dumb, the
   maimed, and many others, and laid them at the feet of Jesus; and he
   cured them: 31. So that the multitudes wondered, when they perceived
   the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, the blind
   to see; and they glorified the God of Israel. 32. And Jesus, having
   called his disciples to him, said, I have compassion on the multitude,
   because they have now remained with me three days, and have nothing to
   eat; and I do not choose to send them away fasting, lest they faint by
   the way. 33. His disciples say to him, Whence shall we obtain so many
   loaves in a solitary place as to satisfy so great a multitude? 34. And
   Jesus saith to them, How many loaves have you? And they say, Seven, and
   a few small fishes. 35. And he commanded the multitudes to sit down on
   the ground. 36. And he took those seven loaves, and the fishes, and
   after that he had given thanks, he broke and gave to his disciples, and
   the disciples to the multitude. 37. And they all ate, and were
   satisfied; and they took up of the fragments that were left seven
   baskets full. 38. And they who had eaten were four thousand men,
   besides women and children. 39. And having sent away the multitudes, he
   embarked, and came to the borders of Magdala.

   31. And again, departing from the territories of Tyre and Sidon, he
   came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the territories of
   Decapolis. 32. And they bring to him one who was deaf, and had an
   impediment in his speech, and implore him to lay his hand on him.
   33. And when he had taken him aside from the multitude, he put his
   fingers into his ears, and spat, and touched his tongue; 34. And
   looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, Ephphatha, that is,
   Be opened. 35. And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of
   his tongue was loosed, and he spoke distinctly. 36. Then he enjoined
   them not to tell it to any person; but the more he enjoined them, so
   much the more the published it: 37. And were amazed beyond measure,
   saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh both the deaf to hear
   and the dumb to speak.

   Mark 8:1-10

   1. In those days, when there wa a very great multitude, and they had
   nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him, and said to them,
   2. I am moved with compassion towards the multitude, because they have
   now remained with me three days, and have nothing to eat. 3. And if I
   shall send them home fasting, they will faint by the way; for some of
   them have come from a distance. 4. And his disciples answered him,
   Whence shall any man be able to satisfy those persons with bread in
   this solitary place? 5. And he asked them, How many loaves have you?
   And they said, Seven. 6. And he commanded the multitude to sit down on
   the ground; and took the seven loaves, and, when he had given thanks,
   brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them, and they set them
   before the multitude. 7. And they had a few small fishes; and when he
   had blessed, he ordered these likewise to be set before them. 8. And
   they ate, and were satisfied; and of the fragments that remained they
   carried away seven baskets full. 9. And they that had eaten were about
   four thousand; and he sent them away. 10. And immediately embarking, he
   came with his disciples to the coasts of Dalmanutha.



   Matthew 15:29. And Jesus departing thence. Though it is unquestionably
   the same journey of Christ, on his return from the neighborhood of
   Sidon, that is related by Matthew and by Mark, yet in some points they
   do not quite agree. It is of little moment that the one says he came to
   the borders of Magdala, and the other, that he came to the coasts of
   Dalmanutha; for the cities were adjacent, being situated on the lake of
   Gennesareth, and we need not wonder that the district which lay between
   them received both names. [422]

   Decapolis was so called from its containing (deka poleis) ten cities;
   and as it was contiguous to Phenicia and to that part of Galilee which
   lay towards the sea, Christ must have passed through it, when he
   returned from Phenicia into Galilee of Judea. There is a greater
   appearance of contradiction in another part of the narrative, where
   Matthew says that our Lord cured many who labored under various
   diseases, while Mark takes no notice of any but of one deaf man. But
   this difficulty need not detain us; for Mark selected for description a
   miracle which was performed during the journey, and the report of which
   was no sooner circulated than it aroused the inhabitants of every part
   of that country to bring many persons to Christ to be cured. Now we
   know that the Evangelists are not anxious to relate all that Christ
   did, and are so far from dwelling largely on miracles, that they only
   glance at a few by way of example. Besides, Mark was satisfied with
   producing one instance, in which the power of Christ is as brightly
   displayed as in others of the same sort which followed shortly
   afterwards.

   Mark 7:32. And they bring to him one who was deaf. The reason why they
   implored him to lay his hands upon him may be learned from passages
   which we have already considered; for the laying on of hands was a
   solemn symbol of consecration, [423] and by means of it, the gifts of
   the Holy Spirit were also bestowed. And there is no doubt that this
   ceremony was frequently used by Christ; so that those men requested
   nothing but what they knew that he had been formerly in the habit of
   doing. On the present occasion, Christ employs other symbols; for he
   puts his spittle on the tongue of the dumb man, and puts his fingers
   into his ears. The laying on of hands would of itself have been
   sufficiently efficacious, and even, without moving a finger, he might
   have accomplished it by a single act of his will; but it is evident
   that he made abundant use of outward signs, when they were found to be
   advantageous. Thus, by touching the tongue with spittle, he intended to
   point out that the faculty of speech was communicated by himself alone;
   and by putting his finger into the ears, he showed that it belonged to
   his office to pierce the ears of the deaf. There is no necessity for
   having recourse to allegories; and we find that those who have amused
   themselves with ingenious discussions on this subject, are so far from
   bringing forward any thing of real value, that they tend rather to hold
   up the Scriptures to ridicule. Readers of sobriety and judgment will be
   satisfied with this single instruction, that we obtain from Christ, in
   answer to our prayers, both speech and hearing; for he pours his energy
   into our tongues, and pierces our ears with his fingers.

   33. And when he had taken him aside from the multitude. This was done,
   partly to afford to those who were ignorant, and not yet sufficiently
   qualified for becoming witnesses, an opportunity of perceiving at a
   distance the glory of his Divine nature, and partly that he might have
   a better opportunity of pouring out earnest prayer. When he looked up
   to heaven and sighed, it was an expression of strong feeling; and this
   enables us to perceive the vehemence of his love towards men, for whose
   miseries he feels so much compassion. Nor can it be doubted, that by
   conveying the spittle from his own mouth to the mouth of another, and
   by putting his fingers into his ears, he intended to manifest and
   express the same feeling of kindness. Yet that he has supreme power to
   remove all our defects, and restore us to health, is proclaimed by him
   when he simply orders the tongue and ears to be opened; for it was not
   without a good reason that Mark inserted that Chaldaic word,
   (ephphatha) Ephphatha, be opened, but to testify the divine power of
   Christ. Among other fooleries with which baptism has been debased by
   foolish men, the ceremony used by our Lord is turned into a piece of
   buffoonery; and this instance shows us that there is no end to
   licentiousness, when men wantonly change at their own pleasure the
   mysteries of God.

   36. Then he enjoined them not to tell it to any person. Many
   commentators torture these injunctions to an opposite meaning, as if
   Christ had purposely excited them to spread abroad the fame of the
   miracle; but I prefer a more natural interpretation which I have
   formerly stated, [424] that Christ only intended to delay the
   publication of it till a more proper and convenient time. I have no
   doubt, therefore, that their zeal was unseasonable, when, though
   enjoined to be silent, they were in haste to speak. We need not wonder
   that men unaccustomed to the doctrine of Christ are carried away by
   immoderate zeal, when it is not called for. Yet what they unwisely
   attempted to do, was made by Christ to promote his own glory; for not
   only was the miracle made known, but the whole of that district, in
   despising the Author of heavenly gifts, was rendered inexcusable.

   37. He hath done all things well. Matthew, after collecting many
   miracles, concludes by saying that the multitudes wondered, and
   glorified the God of Israel; that is, because God, taking unusual
   methods of illustrating his power, had called up the remembrance of his
   covenant. But the words of Mark contain perhaps an implied contrast;
   for the reports concerning Christ were various, and the word multitude
   or crowd (ochlos) may be intended to mean that it was only wicked and
   malicious persons who slandered his actions, since all that he did was
   so far from exposing him to calumny that it deserved the highest
   praise. But we know, and it is what nature teaches us, that nothing is
   more unjust than to make the bestowal of favors an occasion of envy and
   ill-will.

   Matthew 15:32. I have compassion on the multitude. Here a miracle is
   related not unlike another which we have lately explained. The only
   difference is, that on the former occasion Christ satisfied five
   thousand men with five loaves and two fishes, while, on the present
   occasion, four thousand men are fed with seven loaves and a few small
   fishes; and that twelve baskets were then filled with fragments, while
   out of a greater abundance a smaller portion is left. Let us learn from
   this, that the power of God is not restricted to means or outward
   assistance, and that it is all one with Him whether there be much or
   little, as Jonathan [425] said when speaking of his own moderate army
   and the vast multitude of enemies:

   there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few,
   (1 Samuel 14:6.)

   As the blessing of God can make one loaf suffice as well as twenty for
   satisfying a great multitude, so, if that be wanting, a hundred loaves
   will not be a sufficient meal for ten men; for when the staff of bread
   is broken, (Leviticus 26:26,) though the flour should come in full
   weight from the mill, and the bread from the oven, it will serve no
   purpose to stuff the belly. The three days' fasting, of which Christ
   speaks, must not be understood to mean that they had eaten nothing for
   three days; but that in desert places they had few conveniences, and
   must have wanted their ordinary food. Besides, in those warm countries,
   hunger is less keen than in our thick and cold atmosphere; and,
   therefore, we need not wonder that they should abstain longer from
   food.

   33. Whence shall we obtain so many loaves in a solitary place? The
   disciples manifest excessive stupidity in not remembering, at least,
   that earlier proof of the power and grace of Christ, which they might
   have applied to the case in hand. As if they had never seen any thing
   of the same sort, they forget to apply to him for relief. There is not
   a day on which a similar indifference does not steal upon us; and we
   ought to be the more careful not to allow our minds to be drawn away
   from the contemplation of divine benefits, that the experience of the
   past may lead us to expect for the future the same assistance which God
   has already on one or more occasions bestowed upon us.

   Matthew 16:1-4; Mark 8:11-13; Luke 12:54-57

   Matthew 16:1-4

   Mark 8:11-13

   Luke 12:54-57

   1. And the Pharisees, together with the Sadducees, came, and tempting
   desired that he would show them a sign from heaven. 2. But he answering
   said to them, About the commencement of the evening you say, It will be
   fine weather; for the sky is red. 3. And in the morning, There will be
   a storm today; for the sky is red and lowering. Hypocrites, you can
   judge aright of the face of the sky; but can you not judge of the signs
   of the times? 4. A wicked and adulterous nation demandeth a sign, and
   no sign shall be given to it but the sign of the prophet Jonah. And he
   left them, and departed.


   11. And the Pharisees came, and began to dispute with him, requesting
   from him a sign from heaven tempting him. 12. And he groaned in his
   spirit, and said, Why doth this generation ask a sign? Verily, I say to
   you, That no sign shall be given to this generation. 13. And he left
   them, and returned to the ship, and departed across the lake.


   54. And he said also to the multitudes, When you see a cloud rising out
   of the west, you immediately say, A shower is coming; and so it is.
   55. And when you perceive the south wind blowing, you say that there
   will be hot weather; and so it is. 56. Hypocrites, you know how to
   judge of the appearance of the sky and of the earth, and how comes it
   that you do not understand this time? 57. And why even of yourselves do
   you not judge what is right?



   Matthew 16:1. And the Pharisees came. Mark says that they began to
   dispute, from which we may conjecture that, when they had been
   vanquished in argument, this was their last resource; as obstinate men,
   whenever they are reduced to extremities, to avoid being compelled to
   yield to the truth, are accustomed to introduce something which is
   foreign to the subject. Though the nature of the dispute is not
   expressed, yet I think it probable that they debated about the calling
   of Christ, why he ventured to make any innovation, and why he made such
   lofty pretensions, as if by his coming he had fully restored the
   kingdom of God. Having nothing farther to object against his doctrine,
   they demand that he shall give them a sign from heaven. But it is
   certain that a hundred signs would have no greater effect than the
   testimonies of Scripture. Besides, many miracles already performed had
   placed before their eyes the power of Christ, and had almost enabled
   them to touch it with their hands. Signs, by which Christ made himself
   familiarly known, are despised by them; and how much less will they
   derive advantage from a distant and obscure sign? Thus the Papists of
   our own day, as if the doctrine of the Gospel had not yet been proved,
   demand that it be ascertained by means of new miracles.

   The Pharisees, together with the Sadducees. It deserves our attention
   that, though the Sadducees and the Pharisees looked upon each other as
   enemies, and not only cherished bitter hatred, but were continually
   engaged in hostilities, yet they enter into a mutual league against
   Christ. In like manner, though ungodly men quarrel among themselves,
   their internal broils never prevent them from conspiring against God,
   and entering into a compact for joining their hands in persecuting the
   truth.

   Tempting. By this word the Evangelists mean that it was not with honest
   intentions, nor from a desire of instruction, but by cunning and
   deceit, that they demanded what they thought that Christ would refuse,
   or at least what they imagined was not in his power. Regarding him as
   utterly mean and despicable, they had no other design than to expose
   his weakness, and to destroy all the applause which he had hitherto
   obtained among the people. In this manner unbelievers are said to tempt
   God, when they murmur at being denied what their fancy prompted them to
   ask, and charge God with want of power.

   2. About the commencement of the evening. By these words Christ reminds
   them that his power had been sufficiently manifested, so that they must
   have recognised the time of their visitation, (Luke 19:44,) had they
   not of their own accord shut their eyes, and refused to admit the
   clearest light. The comparison which he employs is beautiful and highly
   appropriate; for, though the aspect of the sky is changeable, so that
   sometimes a storm unexpectedly arises, and sometimes fair weather
   springs up when it was not expected, yet the instructions of nature are
   sufficient to enable men to predict from signs whether the day will be
   fair or cloudy. Christ therefore asks why they do not recognize the
   kingdom of God, when it is made known by signs not less manifest; for
   this proved clearly that they were excessively occupied with earthly
   and transitory advantages, and cared little about any thing that
   related to the heavenly and spiritual life, and were blinded not so
   much by mistake as by voluntary malice.

   3. Hypocrites, you can judge. He calls them hypocrites, because they
   pretend to ask that which, if it were exhibited to them, they are
   resolved not to observe. The same reproof applies nearly to the whole
   world; for men direct their ingenuity, and apply their senses, to
   immediate advantage; and therefore there is scarcely any man who is not
   sufficiently well qualified in this respect, or at least who is not
   tolerably acquainted with the means of gaining his object. How comes it
   then that we feel no concern about the signs by which God invites us to
   himself? Is it not because every man gives himself up to willing
   indifference, and extinguishes the light which is offered to him? The
   calling of Christ, and the immediate exhibition of eternal salvation,
   were exhibited to the scribes both by the Law and the Prophets, and by
   his own doctrine, to which miracles were added.

   There are many persons of the same description in the present day, who
   plead that on intricate subjects they have a good right to suspend
   their judgment, because they must wait till the matter is fully
   ascertained. They go farther, and believe that it is a mark of prudence
   purposely to avoid all inquiry into the truth; as if it were not an
   instance of shameful sloth that, while they are so eagerly solicitous
   about the objects of the flesh and of the earth, they neglect the
   eternal salvation of their souls, and at the same time contrive vain
   excuses for gross and stupid ignorance.

   A very absurd inference is drawn by some ignorant persons from this
   passage, that we are not at liberty to predict from the aspect of the
   sky whether we shall have fair or stormy weather. It is rather an
   argument which Christ founds on the regular course of nature, that
   those men deserve to perish for their ingratitude, who, while they are
   sufficiently acute in matters of the present life, yet knowingly and
   willfully quench the heavenly light by their stupidity.

   Mark 8:12. And groaning in his spirit. By these words Mark informs us
   that it occasioned grief and bitter vexation to our Lord, when he saw
   those ungrateful men obstinately resist God. And certainly all who are
   desirous to promote the glory of God, and who feel concern about the
   salvation of men, ought to have such feelings that nothing would
   inflict on their hearts a deeper wound than to see unbelievers
   purposely blocking up against themselves the way of believing, and
   employing all their ingenuity in obscuring by their clouds the
   brightness of the word and works of God. The words, in his spirit,
   appear to me to be added emphatically, to inform us that this groan
   proceeded from the deepest affection of his heart, and that no sophist
   might allege that Christ resorted to outward attitudes to express a
   grief which he did not inwardly feel; for that holy soul, which was
   guided by the zeal of the Spirit, must have been moved by deep sadness
   at the sight of such wicked obstinacy.

   Luke 12:57. And why even of yourselves, etc.? Here Christ opens up the
   source of the evil, and, as it were, applies the lancet to the ulcer.
   He tells them that they do not descend into their consciences, and
   there examine with themselves, as in the presence of God, what is
   right. The reason why hypocrites are so much disposed to make
   objections is, that they throw their swelling words into the air
   without any concern, and never exercise calm thought, or place
   themselves at the tribunal of God, that the truth, when once
   ascertained, may be fully embraced. When Luke says that this was spoken
   to the multitudes, he does not contradict the narrative of Matthew and
   Mark; for it is probable that Christ adapted his style generally to the
   followers and disciples of the scribes, and to other despisers of God
   who resembled them, of whom he perceived that there were too many; as
   the present complaint or expostulation was applicable to the whole of
   that rabble.

   Matthew 16:4. A wicked and adulterous nation. This passage was
   explained [426] under Matthew 12:38. The general meaning is, that the
   Jews are never satisfied with any signs, but are continually tickled by
   a wicked desire to tempt God. He does not call them an adulterous
   nation merely because they demand some kind of sign, (for the Lord
   sometimes permitted his people to do this,) but because they
   deliberately provoke God; and therefore he threatens that, after he has
   risen from the dead, he will be a prophet like Jonah. So Matthew at
   least says -- for Mark does not mention Jonah -- but the meaning is the
   same; for, strictly speaking, this was intended to serve as a sign to
   them, that Christ, when he had risen from the dead, would in every
   place cause the voice of his Gospel to be distinctly heard.

   Luke 12:1

   5. And his disciples, when they had come to the opposite bank, through
   neglect had not taken bread. [427] 6. And Jesus said to them, Take heed
   and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. 7. But
   they considered within themselves, saying, We have not taken bread.
   [428] 8. And when Jesus knew this, he said to them, Why do you think
   within yourselves, O you of little faith, that you have not taken
   bread? 9. Do you not yet understand, and do you not remember those five
   loaves, when there were five thousand men, and how many baskets you
   carried away? 10. Nor those seven loaves, when there were four thousand
   men, and how many baskets you carried away? 11. How comes it that you
   do not understand that it was not about bread that I told you to beware
   of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees? 12. Then they
   understood that he did not bid them beware of the doctrine of the
   Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

   14. And they had neglected to take bread, and had not more than one
   loaf with them in the ship. 15. And he charged them saying, Take heed
   and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.
   16. And they reasoned within themselves, saying, We have not bread.
   [429] 17. And Jesus, perceiving this, said to them, Why do you reason
   that you have no bread? Do you not yet consider or understand? Have you
   your heart yet blinded? 18. Having eyes, do you not see? and having
   ears, do you not hear? and do you not remember? 19. When I fed the five
   thousand men, how many baskets full of fragments did you carry away?
   They say to him, Twelve. 20. And when [I broke] the seven among four
   thousand, how many baskets of the remains of the fragments did you
   carry away? And they said, Seven. 21. And he said to them, How is it
   that you do not understand?


   1. And when an innumerable multitude had assembled, [430] so that they
   trod one upon another, he began to say to his disciples, Above all,
   beware [431] of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy


   Matthew 16:5. And when his disciples came. Here Christ takes occasion
   from the circumstance that had just occurred [432] to exhort his
   disciples to beware of every abuse that makes an inroad on sincere
   piety. The Pharisees had come a little before; the Sadducees joined
   them; and apart from them stood Herod, a very wicked man, and an
   opponent and corrupter of sound doctrine. In the midst of these dangers
   it was very necessary to warn his disciples to be on their guard; for,
   since the human mind has a natural inclination towards vanity and
   errors, when we are surrounded by wicked inventions, spurious
   doctrines, and other plagues of the same sort, nothing is more easy
   than to depart from the true and simple purity of the word of God; and
   if we once become entangled in these things, it will never be possible
   for the true religion to hold an entire sway over us. But to make the
   matter more clear, let us examine closely the words of Christ.

   Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees. Along with the Pharisees Matthew
   mentions the Sadducees Instead of the latter, Mark speaks of Herod Luke
   takes no notice of any but the Pharisees, (though it is not absolutely
   certain that it is the same discourse of Christ which Luke relates,)
   and explains the leaven to be hypocrisy In short, he glances briefly at
   this sentence, as if there were no ambiguity in the words. Now the
   metaphor of leaven, which is here applied to false doctrine, might have
   been employed, at another time, to denote the hypocrisy of life and
   conduct, or the same words might even have been repeated a second time.
   But there is no absurdity in saying, that those circumstances which are
   more copiously detailed by the other two Evangelists, in the order in
   which they took place, are slightly noticed by Luke in a manner
   somewhat different, and out of their proper place or order, but without
   any real contradiction. If we choose to adopt this conjecture,
   hypocrisy will denote here something different from a pretended and
   false appearance of wisdom. It will denote the very source and occasion
   of empty display, which, though it holds out an imposing aspect to the
   eyes of men, is of no estimation in the sight of God. For, as Jeremiah
   (5:3) tells us that the eyes of the Lord behold the truth, so they that
   believe in his word are instructed to maintain true godliness in such a
   manner as to cleave to righteousness with an honest and perfect heart;
   as in these words,

   An now, O Israel, what doth the Lord require from thee, but that thou
   shouldst cleave to him with all thy heart, and with all thy soul?
   (Deuteronomy 10:12.)

   On the other hand, the traditions of men, while they set aside
   spiritual worship, wear a temporary disguise, as if God could be
   imposed upon by such deceptions; for to whatever extent outward
   ceremonies may be carried, they are, in the sight of God, nothing more
   than childish trifles, unless so far as they assist us in the exercise
   of true piety.

   We now perceive the reason why hypocrisy was viewed by Luke as
   equivalent to doctrines invented by men, and why he included under this
   name the leavens of men, which only puff up, and in the sight of God
   contain nothing solid, and which even draw aside the minds of men from
   the right study of piety to empty and insignificant ceremonies. But it
   will be better to abide by the narrative of Matthew, which is more
   copious. The disciples, after having been reproved by our Lord, came at
   length to understand that he had charged them to be on their guard
   against certain doctrine. It was plainly, therefore, the intention of
   Christ to fortify them against prevailing abuses, by which they were
   attacked on all sides. The Pharisees and Sadducees were expressly
   named, because those two sects maintained at that time a tyrannical
   sway in the Church, and held opinions so utterly subversive of the
   doctrine of the Law and the Prophets, that almost nothing remained pure
   and entire.

   But Herod did not in any way profess to teach; and a question arises,
   why does Mark class him with false teachers? Beware of the leaven of
   the Pharisees, and Of The Leaven Of Herod. I reply: he was half a Jew,
   was mean and treacherous, and availed himself of every contrivance that
   was within his reach to draw the people to his side; for it is
   customary with all apostates to contrive some mixture, for the purpose
   of establishing a new religion by which the former may be abolished. It
   was because he was laboring craftily to subvert the principles of true
   and ancient piety, and thus to give currency to a religion that would
   be exceedingly adapted to his tyranny, or rather because he was
   endeavoring to introduce some new form of Judaism, that our Lord most
   properly charged them to beware of his leaven. From the temple of God
   the scribes disseminated their errors, and the court of Herod was
   another workshop of Satan, in which errors of a different kind were
   manufactured.

   Thus in our own day we find that not only from Popish temples, and from
   the dens of sophists and monks, does Antichrist vomit out her
   impostures, but that there is a Theology of the Court, which lends its
   aid to prop up the throne of Antichrist, so that no stratagem is left
   untried. But as Christ opposed the evils which then prevailed, and as
   he aroused the minds of his followers to guard against those which were
   the most dangerous, let us learn from his example to make a prudent
   inquiry what are the abuses that may now do us injury. Sooner shall
   water mix with fire than any man shall succeed in reconciling the
   inventions of the Pope with the Gospel. Whoever desires to become
   honestly a disciple of Christ, must be careful to keep his mind pure
   from those leavens; and if he has already imbibed them, he must labor
   to purify himself till none of their polluting effects remain. There
   are restless men, on the other hand, who have endeavored in various
   ways to corrupt sound doctrine, and, in guarding also against such
   impostures, believers must maintain a strict watch, that they may keep
   a perpetual Passover

   with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth,
   (1 Corinthians 5:8.)

   And as on every hand there now rages an impiety like that of Lucian,
   [433] a most pernicious leaven, or rather a worse than deadly poison,
   let them exercise this very needful caution, and apply to it all their
   senses.

   8. Why do you think within yourselves, etc.? The disciples again show
   how little they had profited by the instructions of their Master, and
   by his wonderful works. What he had said about being on their guard
   against the leaven is rashly interpreted by them as if Christ intended
   only to withdraw them from outward intercourse. As it was customary
   among the Jews not to take food in company with irreligious men, the
   disciples imagine that the Pharisees were classed with such persons.
   This ignorance might perhaps have been endured; but they are forgetful
   of a favor which they lately received, and do not consider that Christ
   has the remedy his power to hinder them from being compelled to pollute
   themselves by meat and drink, and therefore he reproves them sharply,
   as they deserved. And certainly it was shameful ingratitude that, after
   having seen bread created out of nothing, and in such abundance as to
   satisfy many thousands of men, and after having seen this done twice,
   they are now anxious about bread, as if their Master did not always
   possess the same power. From these words we infer that all who have
   once or twice experienced the power of God, and distrust it for the
   future are convicted of unbelief; for it is faith that cherishes in our
   hearts the remembrance of the gifts of God, and faith must have been
   laid asleep, if we allow them to be forgotten.

   12. Then they understood. The word leaven is very evidently used by
   Christ as contrasted with the pure and uncorrupted word of God. In a
   former passage, (Matthew 13:33,) Christ had used the word in a good
   sense, when he said that the Gospel resembled leaven; [434] but for the
   most part this word is employed in Scripture to denote some foreign
   substance, by which the native purity of any thing is impaired. In this
   passage, the naked truth of God, and the inventions which men contrive
   out of their own brain, are unquestionably the two things that are
   contrasted. The sophist must not hope to escape by saying that this
   ought not to be understood as applicable to every kind of doctrine; for
   it will be impossible to find any doctrine but what has come from God
   that deserves the name of pure and unleavened Hence it follows that
   leaven is the name given to every foreign admixture; as Paul also tells
   us that faith is rendered spurious, as soon as we are

   drawn aside from the simplicity of Christ,
   (2 Corinthians 11:3.)

   It must now be apparent who are the persons of whose doctrine our Lord
   charges us to beware. The ordinary government of the Church was at that
   time in the hands of the scribes and priests, among whom the Pharisees
   held the highest rank. As Christ expressly charges his followers to
   beware of their doctrine, it follows that all who mingle their own
   inventions with the word of God, or who advance any thing that does not
   belong to it, must be rejected, how honorable soever may be their rank,
   or whatever proud titles they may wear. Accursed and rebellious,
   therefore, is the obedience of those who voluntarily submit to the
   inventions and laws of the Pope.

   [432] "Ici Christ prenant occasion des propos precedens;" -- "here
   Christ taking occasion from the former discourse."

   [433] "L'mpiete des Lucianistes et des Atheistes;" -- "the impiety of
   the Lucianists and Atheists." Lucian, a celebrated Greek writer, of the
   second century of the Christian era, author of Dialogues of the Dead,
   is here alluded to as the type of scoffers and Atheists. His subject
   naturally led him to treat with sportive humor the solenmities of death
   and the future judgment; and the wit and elegance of his pen, had it
   been guided by ordinary caution, would have been readily -- far too
   readily -- sustained as an apology for the tone of his work. But in
   defiance of the ordinary feelings of mankind, he attacked so fearlessly
   the most sacred truths, and offended the ear of modesty by such
   indecent allusions, that his character as a man has been stamped with
   infamy. Modern times have scarcely produced so daring an infidel, with
   the exception perhaps of Voltaire, who took no pains to conceal his
   intense hatred of Christianity and of good men. Had he appeared
   earlier, his name might perhaps have been substituted for that of
   Lucian, as the representative of his class. -- Ed.

   Mark 8:22-26

   Mark 8:22-26

   22. And he cometh to Bethsaida, and they bring to him a blind man, and
   implore him to touch him. 23. Then taking the blind man by the hand, he
   led him out of the village. And when he had spat on his eyes, and laid
   his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw any thing. 24. And he
   looking up said, I see men; for I perceive them walking as if they were
   trees. 25. Then he again laid his hands upon his eyes, and desired him
   to look; and he was restored, so that he saw them all clearly. 26. And
   he sent him away to his own house, saying, Neither enter into the
   village, nor tell it to any one in the village.



   This miracle, which is omitted by the other two Evangelists, appears to
   have been related by Mark chiefly on account of this circumstance, that
   Christ restored sight to the blind man, not in an instant, as he was
   generally accustomed to do, but in a gradual manner. He did so most
   probably for the purpose of proving, in the case of this man, that he
   had full liberty as to his method of proceeding, and was not restricted
   to a fixed rule, so as not to resort to a variety of methods in
   exercising his power. On this account, he does not all at once
   enlighten the eyes of the blind man, and fit them for performing their
   office, but communicates to them at first a dark and confused
   perception, and afterwards, by laying on his hands a second time,
   enables them to see perfectly. And so the grace of Christ, which had
   formerly been poured out suddenly on others, flowed by drops, as it
   were, on this man.

   Mark 8:24. I see men. Our Lord had put the question to the blind man
   for the sake of his disciples, to inform them that the man had received
   something, but that hitherto nothing more than a slight commencement of
   the cure had been effected. The reply is, that he sees men, because he
   perceives some persons walking who are upright like trees By these
   words he acknowledges that his sight is not yet so clear as to
   distinguish men from trees, but that he has already obtained some power
   of seeing, because he conjectures from the motion that those whom he
   perceives to be in an erect posture are men; and it is in this respect
   that he says they are like trees We see then that he speaks only by
   conjecture when he says that he sees men

   26. And he sent him away to his house. Christ does not suffer him to
   return to Bethsaida, where there were many that had beheld the miracle.
   This is conjectured by some to have been done, because Christ intended
   to punish the inhabitants of that place by depriving them of the
   enjoyment of his favor. Whatever might be the reason, it is certain
   that no miracle was performed by him in order to remain perpetually
   buried, but that he intended to have it concealed along with many
   others, till, after having expiated by his death the sins of the world,
   [435] he should ascend to the glory of the Father.

   13. And when Jesus came to the coasts of Cesarea Philippi, he asked his
   disciples, saying, Who do men say that I the Son of man am? 14. And
   they said, Some [say,] John the Baptist; and other, Elijah; and others,
   Jeremiah, or one of the prophets. 15. He saith to them, But who do you
   say that I am? 16. And Simon Peter answering said, Thou art the Christ,
   the Son of the living God. 17. And Jesus answering said to him, Blessed
   art thou, Simon Bar-Jona; [436] for flesh and blood hath not revealed
   it to thee, but my Father who is in heaven. 18. But I say to thee, That
   thou art Peter, and on this rock will I build my church; and the gates
   of hell shall not prevail against it. 19. And I will give to thee the
   keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
   shall be bound in heaven; and whatseover thou shalt loose on earth
   shall be loosed in heaven.


   27. And Jesus departed, and his disciples, into the villages of
   Cesarea, which is called, Philippi; and by the way he asked his
   disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am? 28. And they
   replied, John the Baptist; and some, Elijah; and others, One of the
   prophets, 29. And he saith to them, But who do you say that I am? And
   Peter answering saith to him, Thou art the Christ.


   18. And it happened, when he was alone praying, his disciples also were
   with him, and he asked them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I
   am? 19. And they answering said, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah;
   and others, that one of the ancient prophets hath risen. 20. And he
   said to them, And who do you say that I am? Simon Peter answering said,
   The Christ of God.



   Matthew 16:13. And when Jesus came to the coasts of Cesarea Philippi.
   Mark says that this conversation took place during the journey. Luke
   says that it took place while he was praying, and while there were none
   in company with him but his disciples. Matthew is not so exact in
   mentioning the time. All the three unquestionably relate the same
   narrative; and it is possible that Christ may have stopped at a certain
   place during that journey to pray, and that afterwards he may have put
   the question to his disciples. There were two towns called Cesarea, of
   which the former was more celebrated, and had been anciently called The
   Tower of Strato; while the latter, which is mentioned here, was
   situated at the foot of Mount Lebanon, not far from the river Jordan.
   It is for the sake of distinguishing between these two towns that
   Philippi is added to the name; for though it is conjectured by some to
   have been built on the same spot where the town of Dan formerly stood,
   yet, as it had lately been rebuilt by Philip the Tetrarch, it was
   called Philippi [437]

   Who do men say that I am? This might be supposed to mean, What was the
   current rumor about the Redeemer, who became the Son of man? But the
   question is quite different, What do men think about Jesus the Son of
   Mary? He calls himself, according to custom, the Son of man, as much as
   to say, Now that clothed in flesh I inhabit the earth like other men,
   what is the opinion entertained respecting me? The design of Christ
   was, to confirm his disciples fully in the true faith, that they might
   not be tossed about amidst various reports, as we shall presently see.

   14. Some [say,] John the Baptist. This inquiry does not relate to the
   open enemies of Christ, nor to ungodly scoffers, but to the sounder and
   better part of the people, who might be called the choice and flower of
   the Church. Those only are mentioned by the disciples who spoke of
   Christ with respect; and yet, though they aimed at the truth, not one
   of them reaches that point, but all go astray in their vain fancies.
   Hence we perceive how great is the weakness of the human mind; for not
   only is it unable of itself to understand what is right or true, but
   even out of true principles it coins errors. Besides, though Christ is
   the only standard of harmony and peace, by which God gathers the whole
   world to himself, the greater part of men seize on this subject as the
   occasion of prolonged strife. Among the Jews, certainly, the unity of
   faith related solely to Christ; and yet they who formerly appeared to
   have some sort of agreement among themselves now split into a variety
   of sects.

   We see too how one error quickly produces another; for a preconceived
   opinion, which had taken a firm hold of the minds of the common people,
   that souls passed from one body to another, made them more ready to
   adopt this groundless fancy. But though, at the time of Christ's
   coming, the Jews were divided in this manner, such a diversity of
   opinions ought not to have hindered the godly from desiring to attain
   the pure knowledge of him. For if any man, under such a pretense, had
   given himself up to sloth, and neglected to seek Christ, we would have
   been forced to declare that there was no excuse for him. Much less then
   will any man escape the judgment of God who is led by the variety of
   sects to entertain a dislike of Christ, or who, disgusted by the false
   opinions of men, does not deign to attach himself to Christ.

   15. But who do you say that I am? Here Christ distinguishes his
   disciples from the rest of the crowd, to make it more fully evident
   that, whatever differences may exist among others, we at least ought
   not to be led aside from the unity of faith. They who shall honestly
   submit to Christ, and shall not attempt to mix with the Gospel any
   inventions of their own brain, will never want the true light. But here
   the greatest vigilance is necessary, that, though the whole world may
   be carried away by its own inventions, believers may continually adhere
   to Christ. As Satan could not rob the Jews of the conviction which they
   derived from the Law and the Prophets, that Christ would come, he
   changed him into various shapes, and, as it were, cut him in pieces.
   His next scheme was, to bring forward many pretended Christs, that they
   might lose sight of the true Redeemer. By similar contrivances, he
   continued ever afterwards either to tear Christ in pieces, or to
   exhibit him under a false character. Among the confused and discordant
   voices of the world, let this voice of Christ perpetually sound in our
   ears, which calls us away from unsettled and wavering men, that we may
   not follow the multitude, and that our faith may not be tossed about
   amongst the billows of contending opinions.

   16. Thou art the Christ. The confession is short, but it embraces all
   that is contained in our salvation; for the designation Christ, or
   Anointed, includes both an everlasting Kingdom and an everlasting
   Priesthood, to reconcile us to God, and, by expiating our sins through
   his sacrifice, to obtain for us a perfect righteousness, and, having
   received us under his protection, to uphold and supply and enrich us
   with every description of blessings. Mark says only, Thou art the
   Christ. Luke says, Thou art the Christ of God But the meaning is the
   same; for the Christs (christoi) of God was the appellation anciently
   bestowed on kings, who had been anointed by the divine command. [438]
   And this phrase had been previously employed by Luke, (2:26,) when he
   said that Simeon had been informed by a revelation from heaven that he
   would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ For the
   redemption, which God manifested by the hand of his Son, was clearly
   divine; and therefore it was necessary that he who was to be the
   Redeemer should come from heaven, bearing the impress of the anointing
   of God. Matthew expresses it still more clearly, Thou art the Son of
   the living God; for, though Peter did not yet understand distinctly in
   what way Christ was the begotten of God, he was so fully persuaded of
   the dignity of Christ, that he believed him to come from God, not like
   other men, but by the inhabitation of the true and living Godhead in
   his flesh. When the attribute living is ascribed to God, it is for the
   purpose of distinguishing between Him and dead idols, who are nothing,
   (1 Corinthians 8:4.)

   17. Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona. As

   this is life eternal, to know the only true God,
   and him whom he hath sent, Jesus Christ, (John 17:3,)

   Christ justly pronounces him to be blessed who has honestly made such a
   confession. This was not spoken in a peculiar manner to Peter alone,
   but our Lord's purpose was, to show in what the only happiness of the
   whole world consists. That every one may approach him with greater
   courage, we must first learn that all are by nature miserable and
   accursed, till they find a remedy in Christ. Next, we must add, that
   whoever has obtained Christ wants nothing that is necessary to perfect
   happiness, since we have no right to desire any thing better than the
   eternal glory of God, of which Christ puts us in possession.

   Flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee. In the person of one man
   Christ reminds all that we must ask faith from the Father, and
   acknowledge it to the praise of his grace; for the special illumination
   of God is here contrasted with flesh and blood. Hence we infer, that
   the minds of men are destitute of that sagacity which is necessary for
   perceiving the mysteries of heavenly wisdom which are hidden in Christ;
   and even that all the senses of men are deficient in this respect, till
   God opens our eyes to perceive his glory in Christ. Let no man,
   therefore, in proud reliance on his own abilities, attempt to reach it,
   but let us humbly suffer ourselves to be inwardly taught by the Father
   of Lights, (James 1:17,) that his Spirit alone may enlighten our
   darkness. And let those who have received faith, acknowledging the
   blindness which was natural to them, learn to render to God the glory
   that is due to Him.

   18. And I say to thee. By these words Christ declares how highly he is
   delighted with the confession of Peter, since he bestows upon it so
   large a reward. For, though he had already given to his disciple,
   Simon, the name of Peter, (Matthew 10:2; John 1:42,) and had, out of
   his undeserved goodness, appointed him to be an apostle, yet these
   gifts, though freely bestowed, [439] are here ascribed to faith as if
   they had been a reward, which we not unfrequently find in Scripture.
   Peter receives a twofold honor, the former part of which relates to his
   personal advantage, and the latter to his office as an Apostle.

   Thou art Peter. By these words our Lord assures him that it was not
   without a good reason that he had formerly given him this name,
   because, as a living stone (1 Peter 2:5) in the temple of God, he
   retains his stedfastness. This extends, no doubt, to all believers,
   each of whom is a temple of God, (l Corinthians 6:19,) and who, united
   to each other by faith, make together one temple, (Ephesians 2:21.) But
   it denotes also the distinguished excellence of Peter above the rest,
   as each in his own order receives more or less, according to the
   measure of the gift of Christ, (Ephesians 4:7.)

   And on this rock. Hence it is evident how the name Peter comes to be
   applied both to Simon individually, and to other believers. It is
   because they are founded on the faith of Christ, and joined together,
   by a holy consent, into a spiritual building, that God may dwell in the
   midst of them, (Ezekiel 43:7.) For Christ, by announcing that this
   would be the common foundation of the whole Church, intended to
   associate with Peter all the godly that would ever exist in the world.
   "You are now," said he, "a very small number of men, and therefore the
   confession which you have now made is not at present supposed to have
   much weight; but ere long a time will arrive when that confession shall
   assume a lofty character, and shall be much more widely spread." And
   this was eminently fitted to excite his disciples to perseverance, that
   though their faith was little known and little esteemed, yet they had
   been chosen by the Lord as the first-fruits, that out of this mean
   commencement there might arise a new Church, which would prove
   victorious against all the machinations of hell.

   Shall not prevail against it. The pronoun it (autos) may refer either
   to faith or to the Church; but the latter meaning is more appropriate.
   Against all the power of Satan the firmness of the Church will prove to
   be invincible, because the truth of God, on which the faith of the
   Church rests, will ever remain unshaken. And to this statement
   corresponds that saying of John,

   This is the victory which overcometh the world, your faith,
   (1 John 5:4.)

   It is a promise which eminently deserves our observation, that all who
   are united to Christ, and acknowledge him to be Christ and Mediator,
   will remain to the end safe from all danger; for what is said of the
   body of the Church belongs to each of its members, since they are one
   in Christ. Yet this passage also instructs us, that so long as the
   Church shall continue to be a pilgrim on the earth, she will never
   enjoy rest, but will be exposed to many attacks; for, when it is
   declared that Satan will not conquer, this implies that he will be her
   constant enemy. While, therefore, we rely on this promise of Christ,
   feel ourselves at liberty to boast against Satan, and already triumph
   by faith over all his forces; let us learn, on the other hand, that
   this promise is, as it were, the sound of a trumpet, calling us to be
   always ready and prepared for battle. By the word gates (pulai) is
   unquestionably meant every kind of power and of weapons of war.

   19. And I will give thee the keys Here Christ begins now to speak of
   the public office, that is, of the Apostleship, which he dignifies with
   a twofold title. First, he says that the ministers of the Gospel are
   porters, so to speak, of the kingdom of heaven, because they carry its
   keys; and, secondly, he adds, that they are invested with a power of
   binding and loosing, which is ratified in heaven. [440] The comparison
   of the keys is very properly applied to the office of teaching; as when
   Christ says (Luke 11:52) that the scribes and Pharisees, in like
   manner, have the key of the kingdom of heaven, because they are
   expounders of the law. We know that there is no other way in which the
   gate of life is opened to us than by the word of God; and hence it
   follows that the key is placed, as it were, in the hands of the
   ministers of the word.

   Those who think that the word keys is here used in the plural number,
   because the Apostles received a commission not only to open but also to
   shut, have some probability on their side; but if any person choose to
   take a more simple view of the meaning, let him enjoy his own opinion.
   [441] Here a question arises, Why does the Lord promise that he will
   give to Peter what he appeared to have formerly given him by making him
   an Apostle? But this question has been already answered, [442] when I
   said that the twelve were at first (Matthew 10:5) nothing more than
   temporary preachers, [443] and so, when they returned to Christ, they
   had executed their commission; but after that Christ had risen from the
   dead, they then began to be appointed to be ordinary teachers of the
   Church. It is in this sense that the honor is now bestowed for the
   future.

   Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth. The second metaphor, or
   comparison, is intended directly to point out the forgiveness of sins;
   for Christ, in delivering us, by his Gospel, from the condemnation of
   eternal death, looses the cords of the curse by which we are held
   bound. The doctrine of the Gospel is, therefore, declared to be
   appointed for loosing our bonds, that, being loosed on earth by the
   voice and testimony of men, we may be actually loosed in heaven. But as
   there are many who not only are guilty of wickedly rejecting the
   deliverance that is offered to them, but by their obstinacy bring down
   on themselves a heavier judgment, the power and authority to bind is
   likewise granted to the ministers of the Gospel. It must be observed,
   however, that this does not belong to the nature of the Gospel, but is
   accidental; as Paul also informs us, when, speaking of the vengeance
   which he tells us that he has it in his power to execute against all
   unbelievers and rebels, he immediately adds,

   When your obedience shall have been fulfilled,
   (2 Corinthians 10:6.)

   For were it not that the reprobate, through their own fault, turn life
   into death, the Gospel would be to all the power of God to salvation,
   (Romans 1:16;) but as many persons no sooner hear it than their impiety
   openly breaks out, and provokes against them more and more the wrath of
   God, to such persons its savor must be deadly, (2 Corinthians 2:16.)

   The substance of this statement is, that Christ intended to assure his
   followers of the salvation promised to them in the Gospel, that they
   might expect it as firmly as if he were himself to descend from heaven
   to bear testimony concerning it; and, on the other hand, to strike
   despisers with terror, that they might not expect their mockery of the
   ministers of the word to remain unpunished. Both are exceedingly
   necessary; for the inestimable treasure of life is exhibited to us in
   earthen vessels, (2 Corinthians 4:7,) and had not the authority of the
   doctrine been established in this manner, the faith of it would have
   been, almost every moment, ready to give way. [444] The reason why the
   ungodly become so daring and presumptuous is, that they imagine they
   have to deal with men. Christ therefore declares that, by the preaching
   of the Gospel, is revealed on the earth what will be the heavenly
   judgment of God, and that the certainty of life or death is not to be
   obtained from any other source.

   This is a great honor, that we are God's messengers to assure the world
   of its salvation. It is the highest honor conferred on the Gospel, that
   it is declared to be the embassy of mutual reconciliation between God
   and men, (2 Corinthians 5:20.) In a word, it is a wonderful consolation
   to devout minds to know that the message of salvation brought to them
   by a poor mortal man is ratified before God. Meanwhile, let the ungodly
   ridicule, as they may think fit, the doctrine which is preached to them
   by the command of God, they will one day learn with what truth and
   seriousness God threatened them by the mouth of men. Finally, let pious
   teachers, resting on this assurance, encourage themselves and others to
   defend with boldness the life-giving grace of God, and yet let them not
   the less boldly thunder against the hardened despisers of their
   doctrine.

   Hitherto I have given a plain exposition of the native meaning of the
   words, so that nothing farther could have been desired, had it not been
   that the Roman Antichrist, wishing to cloak his tyranny, has wickedly
   and dishonestly dared to pervert the whole of this passage. The light
   of the true interpretation which I have stated would be of itself
   sufficient, one would think, for dispelling his darkness; but that
   pious readers may feel no uneasiness, I shall briefly refute his
   disgusting calumnies. First, he alleges that Peter is declared to be
   the foundation of the Church. But who does not see that what he applies
   to the person of a man is said in reference to Peter's faith in Christ?
   There is no difference of meaning, I acknowledge, between the two Greek
   words Petros (Peter) and petra, (petra, a stone or rock,) [445] except
   that the former belongs to the Attic, and the latter to the ordinary
   dialect. But we are not to suppose that Matthew had not a good reason
   for employing this diversity of expression. On the contrary, the gender
   of the noun was intentionally changed, to show that he was now speaking
   of something different. [446] A distinction of the same sort, I have no
   doubt, was pointed out by Christ in his own language; [447] and
   therefore Augustine judiciously reminds the reader that it is not petra
   (petra, a stone or rock) that is derived from Petros, (Peter,) but
   Petros (Peter) that is derived from petra, (petra, a stone or rock )

   But not to be tedious, as we must acknowledge the truth and certainty
   of the declaration of Paul, that the Church can have no other
   foundation than Christ alone, (1 Corinthians 3:11; Ephesians 2:20,) it
   can be nothing less than blasphemy and sacrilege when the Pope has
   contrived another foundation. And certainly no words can express the
   detestation with which we ought to regard the tyranny of the Papal
   system on this single account, that, in order to maintain it, the
   foundation of the Church has been subverted, that the mouth of hell
   might be opened and swallow up wretched souls. Besides, as I have
   already hinted, that part does not refer to Peter's public office, but
   only assigns to him a distinguished place among the sacred stones of
   the temple. The commendations that follow relate to the Apostolic
   office; and hence we conclude that nothing is here said to Peter which
   does not apply equally to the others who were his companions, for if
   the rank of apostleship was common to them all, whatever was connected
   with it must also have been held in common.

   But it will be said, Christ addresses Peter alone: he does so, because
   Peter alone, in the name of all, had confessed Christ to be the Son of
   God, and to him alone is addressed the discourse, which applies equally
   to the rest. And the reason adduced by Cyprian and others is not to be
   despised, that Christ spake to all in the person of one man, in order
   to recommend the unity of the Church. They reply, [448] that he to whom
   this privilege was granted in a peculiar manner is preferred to all
   others. But that is equivalent to saying that he was more an apostle
   than his companions; for the power to bind and to loose can no more be
   separated from the office of teaching and the Apostleship than light or
   heat can be separated from the sun. And even granting that something
   more was bestowed on Peter than on the rest, that he might hold a
   distinguished place among the Apostles, it is a foolish inference of
   the Papists, that he received the primacy, and became the universal
   head of the whole Church. Rank is a different thing from power, and to
   be elevated to the highest place of honor among a few persons is a
   different thing from embracing the whole world under his dominion. And
   in fact, Christ laid no heavier burden on him than he was able to bear.
   He is ordered to be the porter of the kingdom of heaven; he is ordered
   to dispense the grace of God by binding and loosing; that is, as far as
   the power of a mortal man reaches. All that was given to him,
   therefore, must be limited to the measure of grace which he received
   for the edification of the Church; and so that vast dominion, which the
   Papists claim for him, falls to the ground.

   But though there were no strife or controversy about Peter, [449] still
   this passage would not lend countenance to the tyranny of the Pope. For
   no man in his senses will admit the principle which the Papists take
   for granted, that what is here granted to Peter was intended to be
   transmitted by him to posterity by hereditary right; for he does not
   receive permission to give any thing to his successors. So then the
   Papists make him bountiful with what is not his own. Finally, though
   the uninterrupted succession were fully established, still the Pope
   will gain nothing by it till he has proved himself to be Peter's lawful
   successor. And how does he prove it? Because Peter died at Rome; as if
   Rome, by the detestable murder of the Apostle, had procured for herself
   the primacy. But they allege that he was also bishop there. How
   frivolous [450] that allegation is, I have made abundantly evident in
   my Institutes, (Book 4, Chapter 6,) to which I would willingly send my
   reader for a complete discussion of this argument, rather than annoy or
   weary him by repeating it in this place. Yet I would add a few words.
   Though the Bishop of Rome had been the lawful successor of Peter, since
   by his own treachery he has deprived himself of so high an honor, all
   that Christ bestowed on the successors of Peter avails him nothing.
   That the Pope's court resides at Rome is sufficiently known, but no
   mark of a Church there can be pointed out. As to the pastoral office,
   his eagerness to shun it is equal to the ardor with which he contends
   for his own dominion. Certainly, if it were true that Christ has left
   nothing undone to exalt the heirs of Peter, still he was not so lavish
   as to part with his own honor to bestow it on apostates.

   20. Then he charged his disciples [451] not to tell any one that he was
   Jesus the Christ. 21. From that time Jesus began to make known to his
   disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the
   elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and be
   raised again on the third day. 22. And Peter, taking him aside, [452]
   began to rebuke him, saying, Lord, spare thyself; [453] this shall not
   happen to thee. 23. But he turning said to Peter, Get thee behind me,
   Satan, thou art an offense to me; for thou relishest not those things
   which are of God, but those which are of men. 24. Then Jesus said to
   his disciples, If any man chooses to come after me, let him deny
   himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. 25. For whosoever would
   save his life shall lose it; and on the other hand, whosoever shall
   lose his life on my account shall find it. 26. For what doth it profit
   a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what
   shall a man give, that, in exchange for it, he may redeem his soul?
   27. For the Son of man will come in the glory of his Father with his
   angels: and then will he render to every one according to his actions.
   28. Verily I say to you, There are some standing here, who will not
   taste death till they have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom.


   30. And he threatened, and forbade them to tell any one concerning him.
   [454] 31. And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer
   many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and
   the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. 32. And he
   spoke that saying openly, and Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
   33. But he turning and looking upon his disciples, rebuked Peter,
   saying, Get thee behind me, Satan; for thou relishest not the things
   that are of God, but those that are of men. 34. And when he had called
   the multitude to him along with his disciples, he said to them,
   Whosoever would follow me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross,
   and follow me. 35. For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; and
   whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, and for the sake of the
   gospel, shall save it, 36. For what will it profit a man, if he shall
   gain the whole world, and lose his soul? 37. Or what shall a man give
   as a ransom for his soul? 38. For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and
   of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him likewise
   will the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in the glory of his
   Father with the holy angels.

   Mark 9:1

   1. And he said to them, Verily, I say to you, There are some among
   those who stand here [455] that will not taste death, till they have
   seen the kingdom of God come with power.

   21. And he threatening charged them not to tell this to any one, [456]
   22. Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by
   the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and rise again on
   the third day. 23. And he said to all, If any man would come after me,
   let him deny himself, and take up hi cross daily, [457] and follow me.
   24. For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; and whosoever
   shall lose his life on my account shall save it. 25. For what doth it
   profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and be ruined and lost?
   26. For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my saying, of him
   likewise will the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own
   majesty, and in the majesty of his Father, and of the holy angels.
   27. And I say to you, There truly are some standing here who will not
   taste death, till they see the kingdom of God. [458]



   Having given a proof of his future glory, Christ reminds his disciples
   of what he must suffer, that they also may be prepared to bear the
   cross; for the time was at hand when they must enter into the contest,
   to which he knew them to be altogether unequal, if they had not been
   fortified by fresh courage. And first of all, it was necessary to
   inform them that Christ must commence his reign, not with gaudy
   display, not with the magnificence of riches, not with the loud
   applause of the world, but with an ignominious death. But nothing was
   harder than to rise superior to such an offense; particularly if we
   consider the opinion which they firmly entertained respecting their
   Master; for they imagined that he would procure for them earthly
   happiness. This unfounded expectation held them in suspense, and they
   eagerly looked forward to the hour when Christ would suddenly reveal
   the glory of his reign. So far were they from having ever adverted to
   the ignominy of the cross, that they considered it to be utterly
   unsuitable that he should be placed in any circumstances from which he
   did not receive honor. [459] To them it was a distressing occurrence
   that he should be rejected by the elders and the scribes, who held the
   government of the Church; and hence we may readily conclude that this
   admonition was highly necessary. But as the bare mention of the cross
   must, of necessity, have occasioned heavy distress to their weak minds,
   he presently heals the wound by saying, that on the third day he will
   rise again from the dead. And certainly, as there is nothing to be seen
   in the cross but the weakness of the flesh, till we come to his
   resurrection, in which the power of the Spirit shines brightly, our
   faith will find no encouragement or support. In like manner, all
   ministers of the Word, who desire that their preaching may be
   profitable, ought to be exceedingly careful that the glory of his
   resurrection should be always exhibited by them in connection with the
   ignominy of his death.

   But we naturally wonder why Christ refuses to accept as witnesses the
   Apostles, whom he had already appointed to that office; for why were
   they sent but to be the heralds of that redemption which depended on
   the coming of Christ? The answer is not difficult, if we keep in mind
   the explanations which I have given on this subject: first, that they
   were not appointed teachers for the purpose of bearing full and certain
   testimony to Christ, but only to procure disciples for their Master;
   that is, to induce those who were too much the victims of sloth to
   become teachable and attentive; and; secondly, that their commission
   was temporary, for it ended when Christ himself began to preach. As the
   time of his death was now at hand, and as they were not yet fully
   prepared to testify their faith, but, on the contrary, were so weak in
   faith, that their confession of it would have exposed them to ridicule,
   the Lord enjoins them to remain silent till others shall have
   acknowledged him to be the conqueror of death, and till he shall have
   endued them with increased firmness.

   Matthew 16:22. And Peter, taking him aside, began to rebuke him. It is
   a proof of the excessive zeal of Peter, that he reproves his Master;
   though it would appear that the respect he entertained for him was his
   reason for taking him aside, because he did not venture to reprove him
   in presence of others. Still, it was highly presumptuous in Peter to
   advise our Lord to spare himself, as if he had been deficient in
   prudence or self-command. But so completely are men hurried on and
   driven headlong by inconsiderate zeal, that they do not hesitate to
   pass judgment on God himself, according to their own fancy. Peter views
   it as absurd, that the Son of God, who was to be the Redeemer of the
   nation, should be crucified by the elders, and that he who was the
   Author of life should be condemned to die. He therefore endeavors to
   restrain Christ from exposing himself to death. The reasoning is
   plausible; but we ought without hesitation to yield greater deference
   to the opinion of Christ than to the zeal of Peter, whatever excuse he
   may plead.

   And here we learn what estimation in the sight of God belongs to what
   are called good intentions. So deeply is pride rooted in the hearts of
   men, that they think wrong is done them, and complain, if God does not
   comply with every thing that they consider to be right. With what
   obstinacy do we see the Papists boasting of their devotions! But while
   they applaud themselves in this daring manner, God not only rejects
   what they believe to be worthy of the highest praise, but even
   pronounces a severe censure on its folly and wickedness. Certainly, if
   the feeling and judgment of the flesh be admitted, Peter's intention
   was pious, or at least it looked well. And yet Christ could not have
   conveyed his censure in harsher or more disdainful language. Tell me,
   what is the meaning of that stern reply? How comes it that he who so
   mildly on all occasions guarded against breaking even a bruised reed,
   (Isaiah 42:3,) thunders so dismally against a chosen disciple? The
   reason is obvious, that in the person of one man he intended to
   restrain all from gratifying their own passions. Though the lusts of
   the flesh, as they resemble wild beasts, are difficult to be
   restrained, yet there is no beast more furious than the wisdom of the
   flesh. It is on this account that Christ reproves it so sharply, and
   bruises it, as it were, with an iron hammer, to teach us that it is
   only from the word of God that we ought to be wise.

   23. Get thee behind me, Satan. It is idle to speculate, as some have
   done, about the word (opiso) behind; as if Peter were ordered to
   follow, and not to go before; for, in a passage which we have already
   considered, Luke (4:8) informs us that our Lord used those very words
   in repelling the attacks of Satan, and the verb hupage (from which the
   Latin word Apage is derived) signifies to withdraw [460] Christ
   therefore throws his disciple to a distance from him, because, in his
   inconsiderate zeal, he acted the part of Satan; for he does not simply
   call him adversary, but gives him the name of the devil, as an
   expression of the greatest abhorrence.

   Thou art an offense to me; for thou relishest not those things which
   are of God, but those which are of men. We must attend to this as the
   reason assigned by our Lord for sending Peter away from him. Peter was
   an offense to Christ, so long as he opposed his calling; for, when
   Peter attempted to stop the course of his Master, it was not owing to
   him that he did not deprive himself and all mankind of eternal
   salvation. This single word, therefore, shows with what care we ought
   to avoid every thing that withdraws us from obedience to God. And
   Christ opens up the original source of the whole evil, when he says
   that Peter relishes those things which are of men. [461] Lest we and
   our intentions should be sent away by our heavenly Judge to the devil,
   [462] let us learn not to be too much attached to our own views, but
   submissively to embrace whatever the Lord approves. Let the Papists now
   go and extol their notions to the skies. They will one day learn, when
   they appear before the judgment-seat of God, what is the value of their
   boasting, which Christ declares to be from Satan And with regard to
   ourselves, if we do not, of our own accord, resolve to shut ourselves
   out from the way of salvation by deadly obstacles, let us not desire to
   be wise in any other manner than from the mouth of God.

   24. Then Jesus said to his disciples. As Christ saw that Peter had a
   dread of the cross, and that all the rest were affected in the same
   way, he enters into a general discourse about bearing the cross, and
   does not limit his address to the twelve apostles, but lays down the
   same law for all the godly. [463] We have already met with a statement
   nearly similar, (Matthew 10:38.) [464] But in that passage the apostles
   were only reminded of the persecution which awaited them, as soon as
   they should begin to discharge their office; while a general
   instruction is here conveyed, and the initiatory lessons, so to speak,
   inculcated on all who profess to believe the Gospel.

   If any man will come after me. These words are used for the express
   purpose of refuting the false views of Peter [465] Presenting himself
   to every one as an example of self-denial and of patience, he first
   shows that it was necessary for him to endure what Peter reckoned to be
   inconsistent with his character, and next invites every member of his
   body to imitate him. The words must be explained in this manner: "If
   any man would be my disciple, let him follow me by denying himself and
   taking up his cross, or, let him conform himself to my example." The
   meaning is, that none can be reckoned to be the disciples of Christ
   unless they are true imitators of him, and are willing to pursue the
   same course.

   He lays down a brief rule for our imitation, in order to make us
   acquainted with the chief points in which he wishes us to resemble him.
   It consists of two parts, self-denial and a voluntary bearing of the
   cross. Let him deny himself. This self-denial is very extensive, and
   implies that we ought to give up our natural inclinations, and part
   with all the affections of the flesh, and thus give our consent to be
   reduced to nothing, provided that God lives and reigns in us. We know
   with what blind love men naturally regard themselves, how much they are
   devoted to themselves, how highly they estimate themselves. But if we
   desire to enter into the school of Christ, we must begin with that
   folly to which Paul (1 Corinthians 3:18) exhorts us, becoming fools,
   that we may be wise; and next we must control and subdue all our
   affections.

   And let him take up his cross. He lays down this injunction, because,
   though there are common miseries to which the life of men is
   indiscriminately subjected, yet as God trains his people in a peculiar
   manner, in order that they may be conformed to the image of his Son, we
   need not wonder that this rule is strictly addressed to them. It may be
   added that, though God lays both on good and bad men the burden of the
   cross, yet unless they willingly bend their shoulders to it, they are
   not said to bear the cross; for a wild and refractory horse cannot be
   said to admit his rider, though he carries him. The patience of the
   saints, therefore, consists in bearing willingly the cross which has
   been laid on them. [466] Luke adds the word daily -- let him take up
   his cross Daily -- which is very emphatic; for Christ's meaning is,
   that there will be no end to our warfare till we leave the world. Let
   it be the uninterrupted exercise of the godly, that when many
   afflictions have run their course, they may be prepared to endure fresh
   afflictions.

   25. For he that would save his life shall lose it. It is a most
   appropriate consolation, that they who willingly suffer death for the
   sake of Christ [467] do actually obtain life; for Mark expressly states
   this as the motive to believers in dying -- for my sake, and for the
   sake of the Gospel -- and in the words of Matthew the same thing must
   be understood. It frequently happens that irreligious men are prompted
   by ambition or despair to despise life; and to such persons it will be
   no advantage that they are courageous in meeting death. The
   threatening, which is contrasted with the promise, has also a powerful
   tendency to shake off carnal sloth, when he reminds men who are
   desirous of the present life, that the only advantage which they reap
   is, to lose life. There is a contrast intended here between temporal
   and eternal death, as we have explained under Matthew 10:39, where the
   reader will find the rest of this subject. [468]

   26. For what doth it profit a man? The word soul is here used in the
   strictest sense. Christ reminds them that the soul of man was not
   created merely to enjoy the world for a few days, but to obtain at
   length its immortality in heaven. What carelessness and what brutal
   stupidity is this, that men are so strongly attached to the world, and
   so much occupied with its affairs, as not to consider why they were
   born, and that God gave them an immortal soul, in order that, when the
   course of the earthly life was finished, they might live eternally in
   heaven! And, indeed, it is universally acknowledged, that the soul is
   of higher value than all the riches and enjoyments of the world; but
   yet men are so blinded by carnal views, that they knowingly and
   willfully abandon their souls to destruction. That the world may not
   fascinate us by its allurements, let us remember the surpassing worth
   of our soul; for if this be seriously considered, it will easily dispel
   the vain imaginations of earthly happiness.

   27. For the Son of man will come. That the doctrine which has just been
   laid down may more deeply affect our minds, Christ places before our
   eyes the future judgment; for if we would perceive the worthlessness of
   this fading life, we must be deeply affected by the view of the
   heavenly life. So tardy and sluggish is our mind, that it needs to be
   aided by looking towards heaven. Christ summons believers to his
   judgment-seat, to lead them to reflect at all times that they lived for
   no other object than to long after that blessed redemption, which will
   be revealed at the proper time. The admonition is intended to inform
   us, that they do not strive in vain who set a higher value on the
   confession of faith than on their own life. "Place your lives
   fearlessly," says he, "in my hand, and under my protection; for I will
   at length appear as your avenger, and will fully restore you, though
   for the time you may seem to have perished."

   In the glory of the Father, with his angels. These are mentioned to
   guard his disciples against judging of his kingdom from present
   appearances; for hitherto he was unknown and despised, being concealed
   under the form and condition of a servant. He assures them that it will
   be far otherwise when he shall appear as the Judge of the world. As to
   the remaining part of the passage in Mark and Luke, the reader will
   find it explained under the tenth chapter of Matthew. [469]

   And then will he render to every one according to his actions. The
   reward of works has been treated by me as fully as was necessary under
   another passage. [470] It amounts to this: When a reward is promised to
   good works, their merit is not contrasted with the justification which
   is freely bestowed on us through faith; nor is it pointed out as the
   cause of our salvation, but is only held out to excite believers to aim
   at doing what is right, [471] by assuring them that their labor will
   not be lost. There is a perfect agreement, therefore, between these two
   statements, that we are justified freely, (Romans 3:24,) because we are
   received into God's favor without any merit; [472] and yet that God, of
   his own good pleasure, bestows on our works a reward which we did not
   deserve.

   28. Verily, I say to you. As the disciples might still hesitate and
   inquire when that day would be, our Lord animates them by the immediate
   assurance, that he will presently give them a proof of his future
   glory. We know the truth of the common proverb, that to one who is in
   expectation even speed looks like delay; but never does it hold more
   true, than when we are told to wait for our salvation till the coming
   of Christ. To support his disciples in the meantime, our Lord holds out
   to them, for confirmation, an intermediate period; as much as to say,
   "If it seem too long to wait for the day of my coming, I will provide
   against this in good time; for before you come to die, you will see
   with your eyes that kingdom of God, of which I bid you entertain a
   confident hope." This is the natural import of the words; for the
   notion adopted by some, that they were intended to apply to John, is
   ridiculous.

   Coming in his kingdom. By the coming of the kingdom of God we are to
   understand the manifestation of heavenly glory, which Christ began to
   make at his resurrection, and which he afterwards made more fully by
   sending the Holy Spirit, and by the performance of miracles; for by
   those beginnings he gave his people a taste of the newness of the
   heavenly life, when they perceived, by certain and undoubted proofs,
   that he was sitting at the right hand of the Father.

   1. And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, and James, and John his
   brother, and leadeth them to a high mountain apart; 2. And was
   transfigured before them: and his face shone as the sun, and his
   garments became white as the light. 3. And, lo, there appeared to them
   [473] Moses and Elijah talking with him. 4. And Peter answering said to
   Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make
   here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for
   Elijah. 5. While he was speaking, lo, a bright cloud overshadowed them;
   and, lo, a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son,
   in whom I am well pleased; hear him. 6. And having heard this, the
   disciples fell on their face, [474] and were exceedingly afraid.
   7. Then Jesus approaching touched them, and said, Arise, and be not
   afraid. 8. And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man but
   Jesus only.


   2. And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, and James, and John, and
   leadeth them to a high mountain apart by themselves, and was
   transfigured before them. 3. And his garments became shining,
   exceedingly white as snow, so white as no fuller on earth could make
   them. 4. And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were
   conversing with Jesus. 5. And Peter answering said to Jesus, Rabbi, it
   is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for
   thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. 6. For he knew not what he
   said; for they were terrified. 7. And there came a cloud that
   overshadowed them; and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is
   my beloved Son; hear him. 8. And suddenly, when they looked around,
   they saw no other person, but Jesus alone with them.


   28. And it happened about eight days after these words, and he took
   Peter, and James, and John, and went up to a mountain to pray. 29. And
   while he was praying, the appearance of his countenance was changed,
   and his raiment became white and dazzling. [475] 30. And, lo, two men
   talked with him; who were Moses and Elijah; 31. Who appeared in a
   majestic form, and spoke of the decease which he would accomplish at
   Jerusalem. 32. And Peter, and they that were with him, were overpowered
   with sleep; and when they awoke, they saw his glory, and the two men
   who were with him. 33. And it happened, while they were departing from
   him, [476] Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here:
   and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and
   one for Elijah: not knowing what he said. 34. And while he was speaking
   these words, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were afraid
   as they entered into the cloud. 35. And a voice came out of the cloud,
   saying, This is my beloved Son; hear him. 36. And while the voice was
   uttered, Jesus was found alone.


   Matthew 17:1. And after six days. We must first inquire for what
   purpose Christ clothed himself with heavenly glory for a short time,
   and why he did not admit more than three of his disciples to be
   spectators. Some think that he did so, in order to fortify them against
   the trial which they were soon to meet with, arising from his death.
   That does not appear to me to be a probable reason; for why should he
   have deprived the rest of the same remedy, or rather, why does he
   expressly forbid them to make known what they had seen till after his
   resurrection, but because the result of the vision would be later than
   his death? I have no doubt whatever that Christ intended to show that
   he was not dragged unwillingly to death, but that he came forward of
   his own accord, to offer to the Father the sacrifice of obedience. The
   disciples were not made aware of this till Christ rose; nor was it even
   necessary that, at the very moment of his death, they should perceive
   the divine power of Christ, so as to acknowledge it to be victorious on
   the cross; but the instruction which they now received was intended to
   be useful at a future period both to themselves and to us, that no man
   might take offense at the weakness of Christ, as if it were by force
   and necessity that he had suffered. [477] It would manifestly have been
   quite as easy for Christ to protect his body from death as to clothe it
   with heavenly glory.

   We are thus taught that he was subjected to death, because he wished it
   to be so; that he was crucified, because he offered himself. That same
   flesh, which was sacrificed on the cross and lay in the grave, might
   have been exempted from death and the grave; for it had already
   partaken of the heavenly glory. We are also taught that, so long as
   Christ remained in the world, bearing the form of a servant, and so
   long as his majesty was concealed under the weakness of the flesh,
   nothing had been taken from him, for it was of his own accord that he
   emptied himself, (Philippians 2:7;) but now his resurrection has drawn
   aside that veil by which his power had been concealed for a time.

   Our Lord reckoned it enough to select three witnesses, because that is
   the number which the Law has laid down for proving any thing;

   at the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses,
   (Deuteronomy 17:6.)

   The difference as to time ought not to give us uneasiness. Matthew and
   Mark reckon six entire days, which had elapsed between the events. Luke
   says that it happened about eight days afterwards, including both the
   day on which Christ spake these words, and the day on which he was
   transfigured. We see then that, under a diversity of expression, there
   is a perfect agreement as to the meaning.

   2. And was transfigured before them. Luke says that this happened while
   he was praying; and from the circumstances of time and place, we may
   infer that he had prayed for what he now obtained, that in the
   brightness of an unusual form his Godhead might become visible; not
   that he needed to ask by prayer from another what he did not possess,
   or that he doubted his Father's willingness, but because, during the
   whole course of his humiliation, he always ascribed to the Father
   whatever he did as a divine Person, and because he intended to excite
   us to prayer by his example.

   His transfiguration did not altogether enable his disciples to see
   Christ, as he now is in heaven, but gave them a taste of his boundless
   glory, such as they were able to comprehend. Then his face shone as the
   sun; but now he is far beyond the sun in brightness. In his raiment an
   unusual and dazzling whiteness appeared; but now without raiment a
   divine majesty shines in his whole body. Thus in ancient times God
   appeared to the holy fathers, not as He was in Himself, but so far as
   they could endure the rays of His infinite brightness; for John
   declares that not until

   they are like him will they see him as he is, (1 John 3:2.)

   There is no necessity for entering here into ingenious inquiries as to
   the whiteness of his garments, or the brightness of his countenance;
   for this was not a complete exhibition of the heavenly glory of Christ,
   but, under symbols which were adapted to the capacity of the flesh, he
   enabled them to taste in part what could not be fully comprehended.

   3. And, lo, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah. It is asked, Were
   Moses and Elijah actually present? or was it only an apparition that
   was exhibited to the disciples, as the prophets frequently beheld
   visions of things that were absent? Though the subject admits, as we
   say, of arguments on both sides, yet I think it more probable that they
   were actually brought to that place. There is no absurdity in this
   supposition; for God has bodies and souls in his hand, and can restore
   the dead to life at his pleasure, whenever he sees it to be necessary.
   Moses and Elijah did not then rise on their own account, [478] but in
   order to wait upon Christ. It will next be asked, How came the apostles
   to know Moses and Elijah, whom they had never seen? The answer is easy.
   God, who brought them forward, gave also signs and tokens by which they
   were enabled to know them. It was thus by an extraordinary revelation
   that they obtained the certain knowledge that they were Moses and
   Elijah

   But why did these two appear rather than others who equally belonged to
   the company of the holy fathers? It was intended to demonstrate that
   Christ alone is the end of the Law and of the Prophets; and that single
   reason ought to satisfy us: for it was of the utmost importance to our
   faith that Christ did not come into our world without a testimony, but
   with commendations which God had formerly bestowed. I have no
   objection, however, to the reason which is commonly adduced, that
   Elijah was selected, in preference to others, as the representative of
   all the Prophets; because, though he left nothing in writing, yet next
   to Moses he was the most distinguished of their number, restored the
   worship of God which had been corrupted, and stood unrivaled in his
   exertions for vindicating the Law and true godliness, which was at that
   time almost extinct.

   And they conversed with Jesus. When they appeared along with Christ,
   and held conversation with him, this was a declaration of their being
   agreed. The subject on which they conversed is stated by Luke only:
   they talked of the decease which awaited Christ at Jerusalem This must
   not be understood to refer to them as private individuals, but rather
   to the commission which they had formerly received. Though it was now a
   long time since they had died and finished the course of their calling,
   yet our Lord intended once more to ratify by their voice what they had
   taught during their life, in order to inform us that the same
   salvation, through the sacrifice of Christ, is held out to us in common
   with the holy fathers. At the time when the ancient prophets uttered
   their predictions concerning the death of Christ, he himself, who was
   the eternal wisdom of God, was sitting on the invisible throne of his
   glory. Hence it follows that, when he was clothed in flesh, he was not
   liable to death any farther than as he submitted to it of his own free
   will.

   4. Lord, it is good for us to be here. Luke tells us that Peter uttered
   these words while Moses and Elijah were departing; and hence we infer
   that he was afraid lest, at their departure, that pleasant and
   delightful exhibition should vanish away. We need not wonder that Peter
   was so captivated by the loveliness of what he beheld, as to lose sight
   of every other person, and rest satisfied with the mere enjoyment of
   it; as it is said in the psalm,

   In thy presence is fulnessess of joy, (Psalm 16:11.)

   But his desire was foolish; first, because he did not comprehend the
   design of the vision; secondly, because he absurdly put the servants on
   a level with their Lord; and, thirdly, he was mistaken in proposing to
   build fading tabernacles [479] for men who had been already admitted to
   the glory of heaven and of the angels.

   I have said that he did not understand the design of the vision; for,
   while he was hearing, from the mouth of Moses and Elijah, that the time
   of Christ's death was at hand, he foolishly dreamed that his present
   aspect, which was temporary, would endure for ever. And what if the
   kingdom of Christ had been confined in this way to the narrow limits of
   twenty or thirty feet? Where would have been the redemption of the
   whole world? Where would have been the communication of eternal
   salvation? It was also highly absurd to conceive of Moses and Elijah as
   companions of the Son of God, as if it had not been proper that all
   should be reduced to a lower rank, that he alone may have the
   pre-eminence. And if Peter is satisfied with his present condition, why
   does he suppose that earthly supports were needed by those persons, the
   very sight of whom, he imagined, was enough to make him happy?

   Justly, therefore, is it stated by two of the Evangelists, that he knew
   not what he said; and Mark assigns the reason, that they were afraid;
   for God did not intend that the apostles should, at that time, derive
   any advantage from it beyond that of beholding for a moment, as in a
   bright mirror, the divinity of his Son. At a later period, he pointed
   out to them the fruit of the vision, and corrected the error of their
   judgment. What is stated by Mark must therefore mean, that Peter was
   carried away by frenzy, and spoke like a man who had lost his senses.

   5. Lo, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Their eyes were covered by a
   cloud, in order to inform them, that they were not yet prepared for
   beholding the brightness of the heavenly glory. For, when the Lord gave
   tokens of his presence, he employed, at the same time, some coverings
   to restrain the arrogance of the human mind. So now, with the view of
   teaching his disciples a lesson of humility, he withdraws from their
   eyes the sight of the heavenly glory. This admonition is likewise
   addressed to us, that we may not seek to pry into the secrets which lie
   beyond our senses, but, on the contrary, that every man may keep within
   the limits of sobriety, according to the measure of his faith. In a
   word, this cloud ought to serve us as a bridle, that our curiosity may
   not indulge in undue wantonness. The disciples, too, were warned that
   they must return to their former warfare, and therefore must not expect
   a triumph before the time.

   And, lo, a voice from the cloud. It deserves our attention, that the
   voice of God was heard from the cloud, but that neither a body nor a
   face was seen. Let us therefore remember the warning which Moses gives
   us, that God has no visible shape, lest we should deceive ourselves by
   imagining that He resembled a man, (Deuteronomy 4:15.) There were, no
   doubt, various appearances under which God made himself known to the
   holy fathers in ancient times; but in all cases he refrained from using
   signs which might induce them to make for themselves idols. And
   certainly, as the minds of men are too strongly inclined to foolish
   imaginations, there was no necessity for throwing oil upon the flame.
   [480] This manifestation of the glory of God was remarkable above all
   others. When he makes a cloud to pass between Him and us, and invites
   us to himself by His voice, what madness is it to attempt to place Him
   before our eyes by a block of wood or of stone? Let us therefore
   endeavor to enter by faith alone, and not by the eyes of flesh, into
   that inaccessible light in which God dwells. The voice came from the
   cloud, that the disciples, knowing it to have proceeded from God, might
   receive it with due reverence.

   This is my beloved Son. I willingly concur with those who think that
   there is an implied contrast of Moses and Elijah with Christ, and that
   the disciples of God's own Son are here charged to seek no other
   teacher. The word Son is emphatic, and raises him above servants. There
   are two titles here bestowed upon Christ, which are not more fitted to
   do honor to him than to aid our faith: a beloved Son, and a Master. The
   Father calls him my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, and thus
   declares him to be the Mediator, by whom he reconciles the world to
   himself. When he enjoins us to hear him, he appoints him to be the
   supreme and only teacher of his Church. It was his design to
   distinguish Christ from all the rest, as we truly and strictly infer
   from those words, that by nature he was God's only Son In like manner,
   we learn that he alone is beloved by the Father, and that he alone is
   appointed to be our Teacher, that in him all authority may dwell.

   But it will perhaps be objected, Does not God love angels and men? It
   is easy to reply, that the fatherly love of God, which is spread over
   angels and men, proceeds from him as its source. The Son is beloved by
   the Father, not so as to make other creatures the objects of his
   hatred, but so that he communicates to them what belongs to himself.
   There is a difference, no doubt, between our condition and that of the
   angels; for they never were alienated from God, and therefore needed
   not that he should reconcile them; while we are enemies on account of
   sin, till Christ procure for us his favor. Still, it is a fixed
   principle that God is gracious to both, only so far as he embraces us
   in Christ; for even the angels would not be firmly united to God if
   Christ were not their Head. It may also be observed that, since the
   Father here speaks of himself as different from the Son, there is a
   distinction of persons; for they are one in essence and alike in glory.

   Hear him. I mentioned a little ago, that these words were intended to
   draw the attention of the Church to Christ as the only Teacher, that on
   his mouth alone it may depend. For, though Christ came to maintain the
   authority of the Law and the Prophets, (Matthew 5:17,) yet he holds the
   highest rank, so that, by the brightness of his gospel, he causes those
   sparks which shone in the Old Testament to disappear. He is the Sun of
   righteousness, whose arrival brought the full light of day. And this is
   the reason why the Apostle says (Hebrews 1:1) that

   God, who at sundry times and in various ways spoke formerly by the
   Prophets, hath in these last days spoken to us by his beloved Son.

   In short, Christ is as truly heard at the present day in the Law and in
   the Prophets as in his Gospel; so that in him dwells the authority of a
   Master, which he claims for himself alone, saying, One is your Master,
   even Christ, (Matthew 23:8.) But his authority is not fully
   acknowledged, unless all the tongues of men are silent. If we would
   submit to his doctrine, all that has been invented by men must be
   thrown down and destroyed. He is every day, no doubt, sending out
   teachers, but it is to state purely and honestly what they have learned
   from him, and not to corrupt the gospel by their own additions. In a
   word, no man can be regarded a faithful teacher of the Church, unless
   he be himself a disciple of Christ, and bring others to be taught by
   him.

   6. And having heard this God intended that the disciples should be
   struck with this terror, in order to impress more fully on their hearts
   the remembrance of the vision. Yet we see how great is the weakness of
   our nature, which trembles in this manner at hearing the voice of God.
   If ungodly men mock at God, or despise him without concern, it is
   because God does not address them so as to cause his presence to be
   felt; but the majesty of God, as soon as we perceive him, must
   unavoidably cast us down.

   7. Then Jesus approaching touched them. Christ raises them up when they
   had fallen, and by so doing performs his office; for he came down to us
   for this very purpose, that by his guidance believers might boldly
   enter into the presence of God, and that his majesty, which otherwise
   would swallow up all flesh, might no longer fill them with terror. Nor
   is it only by his words that he comforts, but by touching also that he
   encourages them.

   8. They saw no man but Jesus only. When it is said that in the end they
   saw Christ alone, this means that the Law and the Prophets had a
   temporary glory, that Christ alone might remain fully in view. If we
   would properly avail ourselves of the aid of Moses, we must not stop
   with him, but must endeavor to be conducted by his hand to Christ, of
   whom both he and all the rest are ministers. This passage may also be
   applied to condemn the superstitions of those who confound Christ not
   only with prophets and apostles, but with saints of the lowest rank, in
   such a manner as to make him nothing more than one of their number. But
   when the saints of God are eminent in graces, it is for a totally
   different purpose than that they should defraud Christ of a part of his
   honor, and appropriate it to themselves. In the disciples themselves we
   may see the origin of the mistake; for so long as they were terrified
   by the majesty of God, their minds wandered in search of men, but when
   Christ gently raised them up, they saw him alone If we are made to
   experience that consolation by which Christ relieves us of our fears,
   all those foolish affections, which distract us on every hand, will
   vanish away.

   Matthew 17:9-13

   Mark 9:9-13

   Luke 9:36

   9. And as they were going down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them,
   saying, Tell the vision to no man, till the Son of man be risen from
   the dead. 10. And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then do the
   scribes say that Elijah must come first? 11. And Jesus answering said
   to them, Elijah indeed will come first, and restore all things. 12. But
   I say to you, That Elijah is come already, and they did not know him,
   but have done to him whatever they pleased: thus also will the Son of
   man suffer from them. 13. Then the disciples understood that he had
   spoken to them concerning John the Baptist. [481]


   9. And when they were going down from the mountain, he charged them not
   to tell any man those things which they had seen, till the Son of man
   had risen from the dead. 10. And they kept this saying among
   themselves, disputing with each other what was the meaning of the
   expression which he had used, To rise from the dead. 11 And they asked
   him, saying, Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?
   12. And he answering said to them, Elijah indeed will come first, and
   restore all things; and, as it is written, the Son of man must suffer
   many things and be despised. 13. But I say to you, That Elijah is come,
   and they have done to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of
   him.

   36. And they kept silence, and told no man in those days any of those
   things which they had seen.



   Matthew 17:9. And as they were going down from the mountain. We have
   said that the time for making known the vision was not yet fully come;
   and, indeed, the disciples would not have believed it, if Christ had
   not given a more striking proof of his glory in his resurrection. But
   after that his divine power had been openly displayed, that temporary
   exhibition of his glory began to be admitted, so as to make it fully
   evident that, even during the time that he emptied himself,
   (Philippians 2:7,) he continued to retain his divinity entire, though
   it was concealed under the veil of the flesh. There are good reasons,
   therefore, why he enjoins his disciples to keep silence, till he be
   risen from the dead.

   10. And his disciples asked him, saying. No sooner is the resurrection
   mentioned than the disciples imagine that the reign of Christ is
   commenced; [482] for they explain this word to mean that the world
   would acknowledge him to be the Messiah. That they imagined the
   resurrection to be something totally different from what Christ meant,
   is evident from what is stated by Mark, that they disputed with each
   other what was the meaning of that expression which he had used, To
   rise from the dead Perhaps, too, they were already under the influence
   of that dream which is now held as an undoubted oracle among the
   Rabbins, that there would be a first and a second coming of the
   Messiah; that in the first he would be mean and despised, but that this
   would be shortly afterwards followed by his royal dignity. And, indeed,
   there is some plausibility in that error, for it springs from a true
   principle. The Scripture, too, speaks of a first and a second coming of
   the Messiah; for it promises that he will be a Redeemer, to expiate by
   his sacrifice the sins of the world [483] And such is the import of the
   following prophecies:

   Rejoice, daughter of Zion, behold, thy King cometh, poor, sitting on an
   ass,
   (Zechariah 9:9.)

   We beheld him, and he had no form or beauty, and he resembled a leper,
   so that we had no esteem for him,
   (Isaiah 53:3,4.)

   Again, Scripture represents him as victorious over death, and as
   subjecting all things to his dominion. But we see how the Rabbins
   corrupt the pure word of God by their inventions; and as every thing
   was greatly corrupted in the time of our Lord, it is probable that the
   people had also embraced this foolish notion.

   Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first? The gross mistakes
   which they committed as to the person of Elijah have been pointed out
   on two or three occasions. [484] Perhaps, too, they cunningly and
   wickedly endeavored to lessen the authority of Christ by bringing
   forward Elijah; for as it had been promised that Elijah would come as
   the forerunner of Messiah, to prepare the way before him, (Malachi 3:1;
   4:5,) it was easy to excite a prejudice against Christ, by saying that
   he came unaccompanied by Elijah By a trick closely resembling this, the
   devil enchants the Papists of the present day not to expect the day of
   judgment till Elijah and Enoch have appeared. [485] It may not usually
   be conjectured that this expedient was purposely resorted to by the
   scribes, in order to represent Christ as unworthy of confidence,
   because he wanted the legitimate badge of the Messiah.

   11. Elijah indeed will come first. We have stated elsewhere the origin
   of that error which prevailed among the Jews. As John the Baptist was
   to resemble Elijah by restoring the fallen condition of the Church, the
   prophet Malachi (4:5,6) had even given to him the name of Elijah; and
   this had been rashly interpreted by the scribes, as if Elijah the
   Tishbite (1 Kings 17:1) were to return a second time to the world.
   Christ now declares that every thing which Malachi uttered was true,
   but that his prediction had been misunderstood and distorted from its
   true meaning. "The promise," says he, "that Eliah would come was true,
   and has been already fulfilled; but the scribes have already rejected
   Elijah, whose name they idly and falsely plead in opposing me."

   And will restore all things. This does not mean that John the Baptist
   restored them perfectly, but that he conveyed and handed them over to
   Christ, who would complete the work which he had begun. Now as the
   scribes had shamefully rejected John, Christ reminds his disciples that
   the impostures of such men ought not to give them uneasiness, and that
   it ought not to be reckoned strange, if, after having rejected the
   servant, they should, with equal disdain, reject his Master. And that
   no one might be distressed by a proceeding so strange, our Lord
   mentions that the Scripture contained predictions of both events, that
   the Redeemer of the world, and Elijah his forerunner, would be rejected
   by false and wicked teachers.

   Mark 9:14-27

   Luke 9:37-43

   14. And when they were come to the multitude, a man came to him,
   kneeling before him, 15. And saying, Lord, have compassion on my son,
   for he is lunatic, and is grievously distressed; for frequently he
   falleth into the fire, and frequently into the water. 16. And I brought
   him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him. 17. And Jesus
   answering said, O unbelieving and perverse nation, how long shall I be
   with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him hither to me. 18. And
   Jesus rebuked the devil, who went out of him; and from that instant the
   child was cured.


   14. And when he came to the disciples, he saw a great multitude around
   them, and the scribes disputing with them. 15. And the whole multitude,
   as soon as they saw him, were astonished, and, running to him, saluted
   him. 16. And he asked the scribes, What do you dispute among
   yourselves? 17. And one of the multitude answering said, Master, I have
   brought to thee my son, who hath a dumb spirit; 18. And wheresoever it
   seizeth him, it teareth him, and he foameth, and gnasheth with his
   teeth, and languished: and I spoke to thy disciples to cast him out,
   and they could not. 19. And he, answering, saith to him, O unbelieving
   nation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you?
   Bring him to me. 20. And they brought him to him; and as soon as he saw
   him, the spirit tore him, and he lay on the ground, and rolled about,
   foaming. 21. And he asked hi father, How long is it since this happened
   to him? And he said, From a child. 22. And frequently it hath thrown
   him into the fire, and into the water, to destroy him: but if thou
   canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us. 23. And Jesus
   said, If thou canst believe it, all things are possible to him that
   believeth. 24. And immediately the father of the child, exclaiming with
   tears, said, Lord, I believe; aid thou my unbelief. 25. And when Jesus
   saw that the multitude were crowding upon him, he rebuked the unclean
   spirit, saying to him, Dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, go out of
   him, and enter no more into him. 26. And when the spirit had cried out,
   and torn him greatly, he went out of him; and he became like a dead
   person, so that many said, He is dead. 27. But Jesus stretched out his
   hand, and raised him; and he stood up.

   37. And it happened on the following day, while they were going down
   from the mountain, a great multitude met him. 38. And, lo, a man, who
   was one of the multitude, cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee,
   look to my son; for he is my only son. 39. And, lo, a spirit seizeth
   him, and teareth him foaming, and bruising him, hardly departeth from
   him. 40. And I besought thy disciples to cast him out, and they could
   not. 41. And Jesus answering said, O unbelieving and perverse nation,
   how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.
   42. And while he was still approaching, the devil tore him, and threw
   him down; and Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and cured the child,
   and restored him to his father. 43. And they were all astonished at the
   mighty power of God.



   As Mark is more full, and explains the circumstances very minutely, we
   shall follow the order of his narrative. And first he points out
   clearly the reason why Christ uses a harshness so unusual with him,
   when he exclaims that the Jews, on account of their perverse malice, do
   not deserve to be any longer endured. We know how gently he was wont to
   receive them, even when their requests were excessively importunate.
   [486] A father here entreats in behalf of an only son, the necessity is
   extremely urgent, and a modest and humble appeal is made to the
   compassion of Christ. Why then does he, contrary to his custom, break
   out suddenly into passion, and declare that they can be endured no
   longer? As the narrative of Matthew and Luke does not enable us to
   discover the reason of this great severity, some commentators have
   fallen into the mistake of supposing that this rebuke was directed
   either against the disciples, or against the father of the afflicted
   child. But if we duly consider all the circumstances of the case, as
   they are related by Mark, there will be no difficulty in arriving at
   the conclusion, that the indignation of Christ was directed against the
   malice of the scribes, and that he did not intend to treat the ignorant
   and weak with such harshness.

   During Christ's absence, a lunatic child had been brought forward. The
   scribes, regarding this as a plausible occasion for giving annoyance,
   seized upon it eagerly, and entreated the disciples that, if they had
   any power, they would exercise it in curing the child. It is probable
   that the disciples made an attempt, and that their efforts were
   unavailing; upon which the scribes raise the shout of victory, and not
   only ridicule the disciples, but break out against Christ, as if in
   their person his power had been baffled. It was an extraordinary
   display of outrageous impiety united with equally base ingratitude,
   maliciously to keep out of view so many miracles, from which they had
   learned the amazing power of Christ; for they manifestly endeavored to
   extinguish the light which was placed before their eyes. With good
   reason, therefore, does Christ exclaim that they could no longer be
   endured, and pronounce them to be an unbelieving and perverse nation;
   for the numerous proofs which they had formerly beheld ought at least
   to have had the effect of preventing them from seeking occasion of
   disparagement. [487]

   Mark 9:14. He saw a great multitude around them. The disciples were, no
   doubt, held up to public gaze, as the enemies of the truth are wont, on
   occasions of triumph, to assemble a crowd about a trifle. The scribes
   had made such a noise about it, as to draw down on the disciples the
   ridicule of many persons. And yet it appears that there were some who
   were not ill disposed; for, as soon as they see Jesus, they salute him;
   and even the insolence of the scribes is restrained by his presence,
   for, when they are asked what is the matter in dispute, they have not a
   word to say.

   17. Master, I have brought to thee my son. Matthew describes a
   different sort of disease from what is described by Mark, for he says
   that the man was lunatic But both agree as to these two points, that he
   was dumb, and that at certain intervals he became furious. The term
   lunatic is applied to those who, about the waning of the moon, are
   seized with epilepsy, or afflicted with giddiness. I do not admit the
   fanciful notion of Chrysostom, that the word lunatic was invented by a
   trick of Satan, in order to throw disgrace on the good creatures of
   God; for we learn from undoubted experience, that the course of the
   moon affects the increase or decline of these diseases. [488] And yet
   this does not prevent Satan from mixing up his attacks with natural
   means. I am of opinion, therefore, that the man was not naturally deaf
   and dumb, but that Satan had taken possession of his tongue and ears;
   and that, as the weakness of his brain and nerves made him liable to
   epilepsy, Satan availed himself of this for aggravating the disease.
   The consequence was, that he was exposed to danger on every hand, and
   was thrown into violent convulsions, which left him lying on the
   ground, in a fainting state, and like a dead man.

   Let us learn from this how many ways Satan has of injuring us, were it
   not that he is restrained by the hand of God. Our infirmities both of
   soul and body, which we feel to be innumerable, are so many darts with
   which Satan is supplied for wounding us. We are worse than stupid, if a
   condition so wretched does not, arouse us to prayer. But in this we see
   also an amazing display of the goodness of God, that, though we are
   liable to such a variety of dangers, [489] he surrounds us with his
   protection; particularly if we consider with what eagerness our enemy
   is bent on our destruction. We ought also to call to remembrance the
   consoling truth, that Christ has come to bridle his rage, and that we
   are safe in the midst of so many dangers, because our diseases are
   effectually counteracted by heavenly medicine.

   We must attend also to the circumstance of the time. The father
   replies, that his son had been subject to this grievous disease from
   his infancy. If Satan was permitted to exert his power, to such an
   extent, on a person of that tender age, what reason have not we to
   fear, who are continually exposing ourselves by our crimes to deadly
   strokes, who even supply our enemy with darts, and on whom he might
   justly be permitted to spend his rage, if it were not kept under
   restraint by the astonishing goodness of God?

   Matthew 17:17. O unbelieving and rebellious nation. Though Christ
   appears to direct his discourse to the father of the lunatic, yet there
   can be no doubt that he refers to the scribes, as I have lately
   explained; for it is certain that the reproof is directed, not against
   ignorant and weak persons, but against those who, through inveterate
   malice, obstinately resist God. This is the reason why Christ declares
   that they are no longer worthy to be endured, and threatens that ere
   long he will separate from them. But nothing worse could happen to them
   than that Christ should leave them, and it was no light reproach that
   they rejected so disdainfully the grace of their visitation. We must
   also observe here, that we ought to treat men in various ways, each
   according to his natural disposition. For, while our Lord attracts to
   him the teachable by the utmost mildness, supports the weak, and gently
   arouses even the sluggish, he does not spare those crooked serpents, on
   whom he perceives that no remedies can effect a cure.

   Mark 9:20. And as soon as he saw him. That the devil should rage with
   more than ordinary cruelty against the man, when he is brought to
   Christ, ought not to excite surprise; for in proportion as the grace of
   Christ is seen to be nearer at hand, and acts more powerfully, the fury
   of Satan is the more highly excited. The presence of Christ awakens him
   like the sound of a trumpet. He raises as violent a storm as he can,
   and contends with all his might. We ought to be prepared beforehand
   with such meditations, that our faith may not be disturbed, when the
   approach of the grace of Christ is met by more than ordinary violence
   on the part of our enemy. Nor ought we to lose sight of another point,
   that the true commencement of our cure is, when our affliction is so
   heavy that we are almost at the point of death. It must also be taken
   into account that, by means of the furious attack of Satan, our Lord
   lights a torch to cause his grace to be seen; for, when the spectators
   were appalled at the dreadful spectacle, the display of the power of
   Christ, which immediately followed, was more distinctly perceived.

   21. From a child. Hence we infer that this punishment was not inflicted
   on account of the sins of the individual, but was a secret judgment of
   God. True indeed, even infants, as soon as they have come out of the
   womb, are not innocent in the sight of God, or free from guilt; but
   God's chastisements have sometimes hidden causes, and are intended to
   try our obedience. We do not render to God the honor which is due to
   Him, unless with reverence and modesty we adore His justice, when it is
   concealed from us. Whoever wishes to obtain more full information on
   this point, may consult my Commentary on these words, Neither hath this
   man sinned, nor his parents, (John 9:3.)

   22. If thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us. We
   see how little honor he renders to Christ; for, supposing him to be
   some prophet, whose power was limited, he approaches to him with
   hesitation. On the other hand, the first foundation of faith is, to
   embrace the boundless power of God; and the first step to prayer is, to
   raise it above all opposition by the firm belief that our prayers are
   not in vain. As this man did not suppose Christ to be at all different
   from other men, his false opinion is corrected; for our faith must be
   so formed as to be capable and prepared for receiving the desired
   favor. In his reply Christ does not administer a direct reproof, but
   indirectly reminding the man of what he had said amiss, points out to
   him his fault, and informs him how a remedy may be obtained.

   23. If thou canst believe. "You ask me," says he, "to aid you as far as
   I can; but you will find in me an inexhaustible fountain of power,
   provided that the faith which you bring be sufficiently large." Hence
   may be learned a useful doctrine, which will apply equally to all of
   us, that it is not the Lord that prevents his benefits from flowing to
   us in large abundance, but that it must be attributed to the narrowness
   of our faith, that it comes to us only in drops, and that frequently we
   do not feel even a drop, because unbelief shuts up our heart. It is an
   idle exercise of ingenuity to prove Christ's meaning to be, that a man
   can believe of himself: for nothing more was intended than to throw
   back on men the blame of their poverty, whenever they disparage the
   power of God by their unbelief.

   All things are possible to him that believeth. Christ undoubtedly
   intended to teach that the fullness of all blessings has been given to
   us by the Father, and that every kind of assistance must be expected
   from him alone in the same manner as we expect it from the hand of God.
   "Only exercise," says he, "a firm belief, and you will obtain." In what
   manner faith obtains any thing for us we shall immediately see.

   24. Lord, I believe. He declares that he believes, and yet acknowledges
   himself to have unbelief These two statements may appear to contradict
   each other, but there is none of us that does not experience both of
   them in himself. As our faith is never perfect, it follows that we are
   partly unbelievers; but God forgives us, and exercises such forbearance
   towards us, as to reckon us believers on account of a small portion of
   faith. It is our duty, in the meantime, carefully to shake off the
   remains of infidelity which adhere to us, to strive against them, and
   to pray to God to correct them, and, as often as we are engaged in this
   conflict, to fly to him for aid. If we duly inquire what portion has
   been bestowed on each, it will evidently appear that there are very few
   who are eminent in faith, few who have a moderate portion, and very
   many who have but a small measure.

   Matthew 17:19-21

   Mark 9:28-29

   Luke 17:5-6

   19. Then the disciples, coming to Jesus apart, said, Why could not we
   cast it out? 20. And Jesus said to them, On account of your unbelief;
   for verily I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard-seed,
   you shall say to this mountain. Remove thou hence, and it shall remove;
   and nothing shall be impossible to you. 21. But this kind [490] goeth
   not out but by prayer and fasting.


   28. And when he had entered into the house, his disciples asked him
   apart, Why could not we cast out? 29. And he said to them, This kind
   [491] cannot go out in any other way than by prayer and fasting.


   5. And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith. 6. And the
   Lord said, If you had faith as a grain of mustard-seed, you might say
   to this sycamore tree. Be thou rooted up and planted in the sea; and it
   would obey you.



   Matthew 17:19. Then the disciples coming. The disciples wonder that the
   power which they once possessed has been taken from them; but they had
   lost it by their own fault. Christ therefore attributes this want of
   ability to their unbelief, and repeats and illustrates more largely the
   statement which he had previously made, that nothing is impossible to
   faith It is a hyperbolical mode of expression, no doubt, when he
   declares that faith removes trees and mountains; but the meaning
   amounts to this, that God will never forsake us, if we keep the door
   open for receiving his grace. He does not mean that God will give us
   every thing that we may mention, or that may strike our minds at
   random. On the contrary, as nothing is more at variance with faith than
   the foolish and irregular desires of our flesh, it follows that those
   in whom faith reigns do not desire every thing without discrimination,
   but only that which the Lord promises to give. Let us therefore
   maintain such moderation as to desire nothing beyond what he has
   promised to us, and to confine our prayers within that rule which he
   has laid down.

   But it may be objected, that the disciples did not know whether or not
   the Lord was pleased to cure the lunatic It is easy to reply, that it
   was their own fault if they did not know; for Christ is now speaking
   expressly about special faith, which had its secret instincts, as the
   circumstances of the case required. And this is the faith of which Paul
   speaks, (1 Corinthians 12:9.) How then came it that the apostles were
   deprived of the power of the Spirit, which they had formerly exercised
   in working miracles, but because they had quenched it by their
   indolence? But what Christ said about special faith, in reference to
   this particular event, may be extended to the common faith of the whole
   Church.

   21. This kind goeth not out, [492] By this expression Christ reproved
   the negligence of certain persons, in order to inform them that it was
   not an ordinary faith which was required; for otherwise they might have
   replied that they were not altogether destitute of faith The meaning
   therefore is, that it is not every kind of faith that will suffice,
   when we have to enter into a serious conflict with Satan, but that
   vigorous efforts are indispensably necessary. For the weakness of faith
   he prescribes prayer as a remedy, to which he adds fasting by way of an
   auxiliary. "You are effeminate exorcist," said he, "and seem as if you
   were engaged in a mock-battle got up for amusement; [493] but you have
   to deal with a powerful adversary, who will not yield till the battle
   has been fought out. Your faith must therefore be excited by prayer,
   and as you are slow and languid in prayer, you must resort to fasting
   as an assistance." [494] Hence it is very evident how absurdly the
   Papists represent fasting to be the specific method of driving away
   devils, since our Lord refers to it for no other reason than to
   stimulate the earnestness of prayer. When he says that this kind of
   devils cannot be cast out in any other way than by prayer and fasting,
   he means that, when Satan has taken deep root in any one, and has been
   confirmed by long possession, or when he rages with unbridled fury, the
   victory is difficult and painful, and therefore the contest must be
   maintained with all our might.

   22. And while they remained in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of
   man will be delivered into the hands of men: 23. And they will kill
   him, and on the third day he will rise again. And they were deeply
   grieved.

   Matthew 18:1-5

   1. At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who is the
   greatest in the kingdom of heaven? 2. And Jesus, having called a little
   child to him, placed him in the midst of them, 3. And said, Verily I
   say to you, Unless you be converted, and become as little children, you
   shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. 4. Whosoever then shall
   humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the
   kingdom of heaven. 5. And whosoever shall receive such a little child
   in my name receiveth me.


   30. And departing thence, they passed through Galilee, and he was
   desirous that nobody should know it. 31. For he taught his disciples,
   and said to them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men,
   and they will kill him; and, after being killed, he will arise on the
   third day. 32. but they knew not what he said, and were afraid to ask
   him. 33. And he came to Capernaum; [495] and when he was come into the
   house, he asked them, What were you disputing about among yourselves on
   the road? 34. But they were silent; for they had disputed among
   themselves by the way who was the greatest. 35. And when he had sat
   down, he called the twelve, and said to them, If any man choose to be
   first, he shall be last of all, [496] and servant of all. 36. And he
   took a child, and placed him in the midst of them; and when he had
   taken him in his arms, he said to them, 37. Whosoever shall receive one
   of such children in my name receiveth me; and whosoever receiveth me
   receiveth not me, but him that sent me.


   43. But while all were wondering at everything that he did, he said to
   his disciples, 44. Put these words in your ears; for the Son of man
   shall be delivered into the hands of men. 45. But they understood not
   that saying, and it was hidden from them, so that they did not perceive
   it, and they were afraid to ask him concerning this saying. 46. And a
   dispute arose among them, which of them was the greatest. 47. But
   Jesus, seeing the thought of their heart, took a child, and placed him
   near him, 48. And said to them, Whosoever shall receive this child in
   my name receiveth me; and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that
   sent me; for he that is least among you all shall be great.



   Matthew 17:22. And while they remained in Galilee. The nearer that the
   time of his death approached, the more frequently did Christ warn his
   disciples, lest that melancholy spectacle might give a violent shock to
   their faith. It was shortly after the miracle had been performed that
   this discourse was delivered; for Mark says that he went from that
   place to Galilee, in order to spend there the intervening time in
   privacy; for he had resolved to come to Jerusalem on the day of the
   annual sacrifice, because he was to be sacrificed at the approaching
   Passover.

   The disciples had previously received several intimations on this
   subject, and yet they are as much alarmed as if nothing relating to it
   had ever reached their ears. So great is the influence of preconceived
   opinion, that it brings darkness over the mind in the midst of the
   clearest light. The apostles had imagined that the state of Christ's
   kingdom would be prosperous and delightful, and that, as soon as he
   made himself known, he would be universally received with the highest
   approbation. They never thought it possible that the priests, and
   scribes, and other rulers of the Church, would oppose him. Under the
   influence of this prejudice, they admit nothing that is said on the
   other side; for Mark says that they understood not what our Lord meant.
   Whence came it that a discourse so clear and distinct was not
   understood, but because their minds were covered by the thick veil of a
   foolish imagination?

   They did not venture to make any farther inquiry. This must have been
   owing, in part, to their reverence for their Master; but I have no
   doubt that their grief and astonishment at what they had heard kept
   them silent. Such bashfulness was not altogether commendable; for it
   kept them in doubt, and hesitation, and sinful grief. In the meantime,
   a confused principle of piety, rather than a clear knowledge of the
   truth, kept them attached to Christ, and prevented them from leaving
   his school. A certain commencement of faith and right understanding had
   been implanted in their hearts, which made their zeal in following
   Christ not very different from the implicit faith of the Papists; but
   as they had not yet made such progress as to become acquainted with the
   nature of the kingdom of God and of the renewal which had been promised
   in Christ, I say that they were guided by zeal for piety rather than by
   distinct knowledge.

   In this way we come to see what there was in them that deserved praise
   or blame. But though their stupidity could not entirely be excused, we
   have no reason to wonder that a plain and distinct announcement of the
   cross of their Master, and of the ignominy to which he would be
   subjected, appeared to them a riddle; not only because they reckoned it
   to be inconsistent with the glory of the Son of God that he should be
   rejected and condemned, but because it appeared to them to be highly
   improbable that the grace which was promised in a peculiar manner to
   the Jews should be set at naught by the rulers of the nation. But as
   the immoderate dread of the cross, which had suddenly seized upon them,
   shut the door against the consolation which was immediately added,
   arising out of the hope of the resurrection, let us learn that, when
   the death of Christ is mentioned, we ought always to take into view at
   once the whole of the three days, that his death and burial may lead us
   to a blessed triumph and to a new life.

   Matthew 18:1. At that time the disciples came to Jesus. It is evident
   from the other two Evangelists, that the disciples did not come to
   Christ of their own accord, but that, having secretly disputed on the
   road, they were brought out of their lurking-places, and dragged forth
   to light. There is nothing inconsistent with this in the account given
   by Matthew, who hastens to Christ's reply, and does not relate all the
   circumstances of the case, but passes over the commencement, and
   relates in a summary manner the reason why Christ rebuked the foolish
   ambition of his disciples for the highest rank. When Christ makes
   inquiry about a secret conversation, and forces the disciples to
   acknowledge what they would willingly have kept back, this teaches us
   that we ought to beware of all ambition, however carefully it may be
   concealed. We must also attend to the time at which this occurred. The
   prediction of his death had made them sad and perplexed; but as if they
   had received from it unmingled delight, as if they had tasted of the
   nectar which the poets feign, [497] they immediately enter into a
   dispute about the highest rank. [498] How was it possible that their
   distress of mind vanished in a moment, but because the minds of men are
   so devoted to ambition, that, forgetful of their present state of
   warfare, they continually rush forward, under the delusive influence of
   a false imagination, to obtain a triumph? And if the apostles so soon
   forgot a discourse which they had lately heard, what will become of us
   if, dismissing for a long period meditation on the cross, we give
   ourselves up to indifference and sloth, or to idle speculations?

   But it is asked, what occasioned the dispute among the disciples? I
   reply, as the flesh willingly shakes off all uneasiness, they left out
   of view every thing that had given rise to grief, and fixed on what had
   been said about the resurrection; and out of this a debate sprung up
   among idle persons. And as they refuse the first part of the doctrine,
   for which the flesh has no relish, God permits them to fall into a
   mistake about the resurrection, and to dream of what would never take
   place, that, by mere preaching, Christ would obtain a kingdom, an
   earthly kingdom, and would immediately rise to the highest prosperity
   and wealth.

   There were two faults in this debate. First, the apostles were to blame
   for laying aside anxiety about the warfare to which they had been
   called, and for demanding beforehand repose, and wages, and honors, as
   if they had been soldiers that had served their time. The second fault
   is, that, instead of laboring with one consent, as they ought to have
   done, to render mutual assistance, and to secure for their brethren as
   large a share of honors as for themselves, they strove with wicked
   ambition to excel each other. If we wish that our manner of life should
   receive the approbation of the Lord, we must learn to bear patiently
   the burden of the cross that has been laid on us, till the proper time
   arrive for obtaining the crown, and, as Paul exhorts, in honor
   preferring one another, (Romans 12:10.) To the first of these faults is
   closely allied the vain curiosity of those persons in the present day,
   who, leaving the proper duties of their calling, eagerly attempt to fly
   above the clouds. The Lord, who in the Gospel invites us to his
   kingdom, points out to us the road by which we are to reach it. Fickle
   persons, who give themselves no concern about faith, patience, calling
   on God, and other exercises of religion, dispute about what is going on
   in heaven; as if a man who was about to commence a journey made inquiry
   where a lodging-place was situated, but did not move a step. Since we
   are commanded by the Lord to walk on the earth, those who make the
   condition of departed saints in heaven the subject of eager debate will
   be found, in so doing, to retard their own progress towards heaven.

   2. And Jesus called a child to him. The general meaning is, that those
   who desire to obtain greatness by rising above their brethren, will be
   so far from gaining their object that they do not even deserve to
   occupy the lowest corner. He reasons from contraries, because it is
   humility alone that exalts us. As we are more powerfully affected by
   appearances presented to the eyes, he holds up to them a little child
   as an emblem of humility. When he enjoins his followers to become like
   a child, this does not extend indiscriminately to all points. We know
   that in children there are many things faulty; and accordingly Paul
   bids us be children, not in understanding, but in malice, (1
   Corinthians 14:20;) and in another passage he exhorts us to strive to
   reach the state of a perfect man, (Ephesians 4:13.) But as children
   know nothing about being preferred to each other, or about contending
   for the highest rank, Christ desires that their example should banish
   from the minds of his followers those eager longings after distinction,
   which wicked men and the children of the world continually indulge,
   that they may not be allured by any kind of ambition.

   It will perhaps be objected, that children, even from the womb, have a
   native pride, which leads them to desire the highest honor and
   distinction; but the reply is obvious, that comparisons must not be too
   closely or too exactly carried out, so as to apply at all points. The
   tender age of little children is distinguished by simplicity to such an
   extent, that they are unacquainted with the degrees of honor, and with
   all the incentives to pride; so that they are properly and justly held
   out by Christ as an example.

   3. Unless you are converted. To the example of little children must be
   referred the conversion of which he now speaks. Hitherto they had been
   too much habituated to the ordinary customs of men; and if they would
   gain their object, they must pursue a totally different course. [499]
   Every one wished for himself the first or the second rank; but Christ
   does not allot even the lowest place to any man who does not lose sight
   of distinctions and humble himself On the contrary, he says,

   4. Whosoever shall humble himself like this little child, he is the
   greatest in the kingdom of heaven. This is intended to guard us against
   supposing that we degrade ourselves in any measure by freely
   surrendering every kind of distinction. And hence we may obtain a short
   definition [500] of humility. That man is truly humble who neither
   claims any personal merit in the sight of God, nor proudly despises
   brethren, or aims at being thought superior to them, but reckons it
   enough that he is one of the members of Christ, and desires nothing
   more than that the Head alone should be exalted.

   5. And he that shall receive such a child. The term children is now
   applied metaphorically by Christ to those who have laid aside lofty
   looks, and who conduct themselves with modesty and humility. This is
   added by way of consolation, that we may not account it troublesome or
   disagreeable to exercise humility, by means of which Christ not only
   receives us under his protection, but likewise recommends us to the
   favor of men. And thus believers are taught in what way they ought to
   esteem each other: it is by every one humbling himself How is mutual
   friendship usually maintained among the children of the world but by
   every man complying with the wishes of another? The more desirous a man
   is to obtain renown, the more insolently does he grasp at power, that
   he may be raised to a lofty station, and that others may be ridiculed
   or despised; but Christ enjoins that the more a man abases himself, the
   more highly shall he be honored. Such, too, is the import of the words
   given by Luke, he that is least among you shall be great; for our Lord
   does not enjoin us to think more highly of those who justly deserve to
   be despised, but of those who divest themselves of all pride, and are
   perfectly willing to occupy the lowest place.

   6. But whosoever shall offend one of those little ones who believe in
   me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck,
   and that he were sunk to the bottom of the sea. 7. Woe to the world on
   account of offenses! for offenses must come; but woe to the man by whom
   the offense cometh! 8. But if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut it
   off, and cast it from thee; [501] for it is better for thee to enter
   lame or maimed into life, than that, having two hands or two feet, thou
   shouldst be cast into the everlasting fire. 9. And if thine eye offend
   thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee; [502] for it is better that
   thou shouldst enter into life having one eye, than that, having two
   eyes, thou shouldst be cast into hell-fire. 10. Beware of despising one
   of these little ones; for I say to you, That their angels always behold
   the face of my Father who is in heaven.


   42. And whosoever shall offend one of the little ones who believe in
   me, it were better for him that a millstone were hung around his neck,
   and that he were thrown into the sea. 43. And if thy hand shall offend
   thee, cut it off; for it were better for thee to enter lame into life,
   than that, having two hands, thou shouldst go into hell, into the
   unquenchable fire: [503] 44. Where their worm dieth not, and their fire
   is not quenched. 45. And if thy foot shall offend thee, cut if off; for
   it were better for thee to enter lame into life, than that, having two
   feet, thou shouldst be cast into hell, into the unquenchable fire:
   46. Where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched. 47. And
   if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out; for it were better for thee to
   enter with one eye into the kingdom of God than that, having two eyes,
   thou shouldst be cast into hell-fire: 48. Where their worm dieth not,
   and their fire is not quenched.


   1. And he said to his disciples, It is impossible but that offenses
   will come; but woe to him by whom they come! 2. It were better for him
   that a millstone were hung around his neck, and that he were thrown
   into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.



   Matthew 18:6. But whosoever shall offend one of those little ones. This
   appears to be added for the consolation of the godly, that they may not
   be rendered uneasy by their condition, if they are despised by the
   world. It is a powerful obstruction to the voluntary exercise of
   modesty, when they imagine, that by so doing they expose themselves to
   contempt; and it is hard to be not only treated disdainfully, but
   almost trodden under foot, by haughty men. Christ therefore encourages
   his disciples by the consoling truth, that, if their mean condition
   draws upon them the insults of the world, God does not despise them.

   But he appears to have had likewise another object in view; for a
   dispute had arisen amongst them as to the first place of honor, from
   which it might naturally have been inferred that the Apostles were
   tainted with sinful ambition. Every man who thinks too highly of
   himself, or desires to be preferred to others, must necessarily treat
   his brethren with disdain. To cure this disease, Christ threatens a
   dreadful punishment, if any man in his pride shall throw down those who
   are oppressed with poverty, or who in heart are already humbled.

   Under the word offend he includes more than if he had forbidden them to
   despise their brethren; though the man who gives himself no concern
   about offending the weak, does so for no other reason, than because he
   does not render to them the honor to which they are entitled. Now as
   there are various kinds of offenses, it will be proper to explain
   generally what is meant by offending. If any man through our fault
   either stumbles, or is drawn aside from the right course, or retarded
   in it, we are said to offend him. [504] Whoever then desires to escape
   that fearful punishment which Christ denounces, let him stretch out his
   hand to the little ones who are despised by the world, and let him
   kindly assist them in keeping the path of duty; for Christ recommends
   them to our notice, that they may lead us to exercise voluntary
   humility; as Paul enjoins the children of God to

   condescend to men of low estate, (Romans 12:16,)

   and again says that

   we ought not to please ourselves, (Romans 15:1.)

   To hang a millstone about a man's neck, and drown him in the sea, was
   the punishment then reckoned the most appalling, and which was
   inflicted on the most atrocious malefactors. When our Lord alludes to
   this punishment, we are enabled to perceive how dear and precious those
   persons are in the sight of God, who are mean and despised in the eyes
   of the world.

   7. Woe to the world on account of offenses! This passage may be
   explained in two ways. It may be taken actively, as meaning that Christ
   pronounces a curse on the authors of offenses; and then by the term
   world, we must understand all unbelievers. Or it may be taken
   passively, as meaning that Christ deplores the evils which he perceives
   to be rapidly coming on the world on account of offenses; as if he had
   said, that no plague will be more destructive, or attended by more
   fearful calamities, than the alarm or desertion of many on account of
   offenses. The latter meaning is more appropriate; for I have no doubt
   that our Lord, who had spoken on another occasion about offenses,
   proceeded to discourse more largely on this subject; in order to make
   his disciples more attentive and watchful in guarding against them.
   That Satan may not gain advantage over us through our sluggishness, our
   Lord breaks out into an exclamation, that there is nothing which we
   ought to dread more than offenses; for as Satan has innumerable kinds
   of them in his hand, he constantly, and at almost every step, throws
   new difficulties in our way; while we, through excessive tenderness or
   sloth, are too ready to yield. The consequence is, that there are few
   who make tolerable progress in the faith of Christ; and of the few who
   have begun to walk in the way of salvation, there is scarcely one in
   ten who has the courage to persevere till he reaches the goal. [505]
   Now since Christ intended to strike his disciples with terror on
   account of offenses, and thus to arouse them to exertion, woe to our
   indifference, if each of us does not earnestly apply himself to
   overcome those offenses

   For offenses must come. To awaken more powerfully their care and
   anxiety, our Lord reminds his disciples that there is no possibility of
   walking but in the midst of various offenses; as much as to say, that
   this is an evil which cannot be avoided. Thus he confirms the former
   statement; for Christ shows us how great are the inconveniences which
   arise from offenses, since the Church never will be, and indeed never
   can be, free from this evil. But he does not state the reason of this
   necessity, as Paul does, when, speaking of heresies, he says that they
   arise, that the good may be made manifest, (1 Corinthians 11:19.) It
   must be held by us as a fixed principle, that it is the will of God to
   leave his people exposed to offense, in order to exercise their faith,
   and to separate believers, as the refuse and the chaff, from the pure
   wheat. Does any one object or complain, that blame attaches to our Lord
   for giving loose reins to Satan, to accomplish the destruction of
   wretched men? It is our duty to think and speak with the deepest
   reverence of the secret purposes of God, of which this is one, that the
   world must be disturbed by offenses

   But woe to the man by whom the offense cometh. After having exhorted
   his disciples to beware of offenses, he again breaks out against those
   who occasion them. To impart the greater vehemence to the threatening,
   he adds, that neither a right eye nor a right hand ought to be spared,
   if they occasion offense to us; for I explain these words as added for
   the purpose of amplification. Their meaning is, that we ought to be so
   constant and so zealous in opposing offenses, that we would rather
   choose to pluck out our eyes, or cut off our hands, than give
   encouragement to offenses; for if any man hesitate to incur the loss of
   his limbs, he spares them at the risk of throwing himself into eternal
   perdition. What dreadful vengeance then awaits those who by offenses
   shall bring ruin on their brethren! [506] As those two verses have been
   already explained [507] under Matthew 5:29,30, it was sufficient, on
   the present occasion, to glance at the reason why Christ repeats here
   the same statement.

   10. Beware of despising one of these little ones As pride is the mother
   of disdain, and as contempt hardens men in giving offense, our Lord,
   for the purpose of applying an appropriate remedy for curing this
   disease, forbids his disciples to despise the little ones. And
   certainly, as we have already hinted, no man who has a proper care for
   his brethren will ever allow himself, on light grounds, to give them
   offense. This conclusion of our Lord's discourse has the same tendency
   as the commencement of it, to remind us that we ought to strive with
   each other who shall be most submissive and modest; for God embraces
   with wonderful love the little ones. It would be strange indeed that a
   mortal man should despise, or treat as of no account, those whom God
   holds in such high esteem. He proves this love from the fact, that
   angels, who are ministers of their salvation, enjoy intimately the
   presence of God. Yet I do not think that he intended merely to show
   what honor God confers on them by appointing angels to be their
   guardians, but likewise to threaten those who despise them; as if he
   had said, that it is no light matter to despise those who have angels
   for their companions and friends, to take vengeance in their behalf. We
   ought therefore to beware of despising their salvation, which even
   angels have been commissioned to advance.

   The interpretation given to this passage by some commentators, as if
   God assigned to each believer his own angel, does not rest on solid
   grounds. For the words of Christ do not mean that a single angel is
   continually occupied with this or the other person; [508] and such an
   idea is inconsistent with the whole doctrine of Scripture, which
   declares that the angels encamp around (Psalm 34:7) the godly, and that
   not one angel only, but many, have been commissioned to guard every one
   of the faithful. Away, then, with the fanciful notion of a good and
   evil angel, and let us rest satisfied with holding that the care of the
   whole Church is committed to angels, to assist each member as his
   necessities shall require. It will perhaps be asked, Do the angels
   occupy a station inferior to ours, because they have been appointed to
   be our ministers? I reply, Though by nature they take rank above us,
   this does not prevent them from rendering service to God [509] in
   dispensing the favor which he freely bestows upon us. For this reason
   they are called our angels, because their labors are bestowed on us.

   Matthew 18:11-14

   Luke 15:1-10

   11. For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost. 12. What
   think you? If a man shall have a hundred sheep, and one of them shall
   go astray, doth he not leave the ninety-nine, and go to the mountains,
   and seek that which had gone astray? 13. And if he happen to find it,
   verily, I say to you, he rejoiceth more on account of that sheep than
   on account of the ninety-nine which had gone astray. 14. So it is not
   the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of those little ones
   should perish.


   1. And all the publicans and sinners drew near to him to hear him.
   2. And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth
   sinners, and eateth with them. 3. And he spoke to them a parable,
   saying, 4. What man is there among you, who hath a hundred sheep, and,
   if he shall lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety-nine in the
   wilderness, and go after that which was lost, till he find it? 5. And
   when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing: 6. And
   coming home, he calleth his friends and neighbors, saying to them,
   Rejoice with me; for I have found the sheep which was lost. 7. I say to
   you, that in like manner there will be greater joy in heaven over one
   repenting sinner, than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not
   need repentance. 8. Or what woman having ten pieces of money, [510] if
   she shall lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house,
   and seek diligently until she find it? 9. And when she hath found it,
   she calleth together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with
   me, for I have found the piece which I had lost. 10. In like manner, I
   tell you, there will be joy in the presence of the angels of God over
   one repenting sinner.


   Matthew 18:11. For the Son of man cometh. Christ now employs his own
   example in persuading his disciples to honor even weak and despised
   brethren; for he came down from heaven to save not them only, but even
   the dead who were lost. It is in the highest degree unreasonable that
   we should disdainfully reject those whom the Son of God has so highly
   esteemed. And even if the weak labor under imperfections which may
   expose them to contempt, our pride is not on that account to be
   excused; for we ought to esteem them not for the value of their
   virtues, but for the sake of Christ; and he who will not conform
   himself to Christ's example is too saucy and proud.

   12. What think you? Luke carries the occasion of this parable still
   farther back, as having arisen from the murmurings of the Pharisees and
   scribes against our Lord, whom they saw conversing daily with sinners.
   Christ therefore intended to show that a good teacher ought not to
   labor less to recover those that are lost, than to preserve those which
   are in his possession; though according to Matthew the comparison
   proceeds farther, and teaches us not only that we ought to treat with
   kindness the disciples of Christ, but that we ought to bear with their
   imperfections, and endeavor, when they wander, to bring them back to
   the road. For, though they happen sometimes to wander, yet as they are
   sheep over which God has appointed his Son to be shepherd, so far are
   we from having a right to chase or drive them away roughly, that we
   ought to gather them from their wanderings; for the object of the
   discourse is to lead us to beware of losing what God wishes to be
   saved. The narrative of Luke presents to us a somewhat different
   object. It is, that the whole human race belongs to God, and that
   therefore we ought to gather those that have gone astray, and that we
   ought to rejoice as much, when they that are lost return to the path of
   duty, as a man would do who, beyond his expectation, recovered
   something the loss of which had grieved him.

   Luke 15:10. There will be joy in the presence of the angels. If angels
   mutually rejoice with each other in heaven, when they see that what had
   wandered is restored to the fold, we too, who have the same cause in
   common with them, ought to be partakers of the same joy. But how does
   he say that the repentance of one ungodly man yields greater joy than
   the perseverance of many righteous men to angels, whose highest delight
   is in a continued and uninterrupted course of righteousness? I reply,
   though it would be more agreeable to the wishes of angels (as it is
   also more desirable) that men should always remain in perfect
   integrity, yet as in the deliverance of a sinner, who had been already
   devoted to destruction, and had been cut off as a rotten member from
   the body, the mercy of God shines more brightly, he attributes to
   angels, after the manner of men, a greater joy arising out of an
   unexpected good.

   Over one repenting sinner. The word repentance is specially limited to
   the conversion of those who, having altogether turned aside from God,
   rise as it were from death to life; for otherwise the exercise of
   repentance ought to be uninterrupted throughout our whole life, [511]
   and no man is exempted from this necessity, since every one is reminded
   by his imperfections that he ought to aim at daily progress. But it is
   one thing, when a man, who has already entered upon the right course,
   though he stumble, or fall, or even go astray, endeavors to reach the
   goal; and another thing, when a man leaves a road which was entirely
   wrong, or only starts in the right course. [512] Those who have already
   begun to regulate their life by the standard of the divine law, do not
   need that kind of repentance which consists in beginning to lead a holy
   and pious life, though they must groan [513] under the infirmities of
   the flesh, and labor to correct them.

   Luke 15:11-24

   Luke 15:11-24

   11. And he said, [514] A certain man had two sons: 12. And the younger
   of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of property
   which falls to me. And he divided between them the property. 13. And
   not many days afterwards, [515] the younger son, having gathered all
   together, set out on a journey to a distant country, and there wasted
   his property by living extravagantly. 14. But when he had spent all, a
   sore famine arose in that country; and he began to be in want. 15. And
   he went and entered into the service of one of the inhabitants of that
   country; and he sent him into his field to feed swine. 16. And he was
   desirous to fill his belly with the husks on which the swine were
   feeding: and no man gave to him. [516] 17. And when he came to himself,
   he said, How many hirelings of my father have abundance of bread, [517]
   while I perish with hunger! 18. I will arise, and go to my father,
   [518] and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and
   before thee, 19. And am no longer worthy to be called thy son: make me
   as one of thy hirelings. 20. And he arose, and came to his father. And
   while he was yet afar off, his father saw him, and was moved with
   compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. 21. And the
   son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,
   and am no longer worthy to be called thy son. 22. And the father said
   to his servants, Bring out the best robe, and put it on him; and put a
   ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: 23. And bring the fatted calf,
   and kill it; and let us feast, and be merry: 24. For this my son was
   dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. [519] And they
   began to be merry.



   This parable is nothing else than a confirmation of the preceding
   doctrine. [520] In the first part is shown how readily God is disposed
   to pardon our sins, and in the second part (which we shall afterwards
   treat in the proper place) is shown the great malignity and obstinacy
   of those who murmur at his compassion. In the person of a young
   prodigal who, after having been reduced to the deepest poverty by
   luxury and extravagance, returns as a suppliant to his father, [521] to
   whom he had been disobedient and rebellious, Christ describes all
   sinners who, wearied of their folly, apply to the grace of God. To the
   kind father, [522] on the other hand, who not only pardons the crimes
   of his son, but of his own accord meets him when returning, he compares
   God, who is not satisfied with pardoning those who pray to him, but
   even advances to meet them with the compassion of a father. [523] Let
   us now examine the parable in detail.

   Luke 15:12. And the younger of them said to his father. The parable
   opens by describing a mark of wicked arrogance in the youth, which
   appears in his being desirous to leave his father, and in thinking that
   he cannot be right without being permitted to indulge in debauchery,
   free from his father's control. There is also ingratitude in leaving
   the old man, [524] and not only withholding the performance of the
   duties which be owed to him, but crippling and diminishing the wealth
   of his house. [525] This is at length followed by wasteful luxury and
   wicked extravagance, by which he squanders all that he had. [526] After
   so many offenses he deserved to find his father implacable. [527]

   Under this image our Lord unquestionably depicts to us the boundless
   goodness and inestimable forbearance of God, that no crimes, however
   aggravated, may deter us from the hope of obtaining pardon, There would
   be some foundation for the analogy, if we were to say that this foolish
   and insolent youth resembles those persons who, enjoying at the hand of
   God a great abundance of good things, are moved by a blind and mad
   ambition to be separated from Him, that they may enjoy perfect freedom;
   as if it were not more desirable than all the kingdoms of the world to
   live under the fatherly care and government of God. But as I am afraid
   that this allusion may be thought overstrained, I shall satisfy myself
   with the literal meaning; not that I disapprove of the opinion, that
   under this figure is reproved the madness of those who imagine that it
   will be advantageous for them to have something of their own, and to be
   rich apart from the heavenly Father; but that I now confine myself
   within the limits of a Commentator. [528]

   Christ here describes what usually happens with young men, when they
   are carried away by their natural disposition. Destitute of sound
   judgment, and maddened by passion, they are ill fitted for governing
   themselves, and are not restrained by fear or shame. It is therefore
   impossible but that they shall abandon themselves to every thing to
   which their sinful inclination prompts them, and rush on in a
   disgraceful course, till they are involved in shameful poverty. He
   afterwards describes the punishment which, in the righteous judgment of
   God, generally overtakes spendthrifts and prodigals. After having
   wickedly squandered their means, they are left to pine in hunger, and
   not having known how to use in moderation an abundant supply of the
   best bread, they are reduced to eat acorns and husks. In short, they
   become the companions of swine, and are made to feel that they are
   unworthy to partake of human food; for it is swinish gluttony [529] to
   squander wickedly what was given for the support of life. [530] As to
   the ingenious exposition which some have brought forward, that it is
   the just punishment of wicked scorn, when those who have rejected
   delicious bread in the house of our heavenly Father are driven by
   hunger to eat husks, it is a true and useful doctrine; but in the
   meantime, we must bear in mind the difference that exists between
   allegories and the natural meaning. [531]

   And was desirous to fill his belly. This means that, in consequence of
   hunger, he no longer thought of his former luxuries, but greedily
   devoured husks; for of that kind of food he could not be in want, when
   he was giving it to the swine There is a well-known saying of Cyrus
   who, having for a long time suffered hunger during a flight, and having
   been slightly refreshed by eating coarse black bread, declared that he
   had never tasted savory bread till now; so the young man who is here
   mentioned was compelled by necessity to betake himself with appetite to
   husks The reason is added, because no man gave to him; for the
   copulative conjunction and (kai) must, in my opinion, signify because,
   [532] and what is here said does not refer to husks, which he had at
   hand, but I understand the meaning to be, that no man pitied his
   poverty; for prodigals who throw away the whole of their property are
   persons whom no man thinks himself bound to relieve, -- nay more, as
   they have been accustomed to squander every thing, men think that
   nothing ought to be given to them. [533]

   17. And when he came to himself. Here is described to us the way in
   which God invites men to repentance. If of their own accord they were
   wise, and became submissive, he would draw them more gently; but as
   they never stoop to obedience, till they have been subdued by the rod,
   he chastises them severely. Accordingly, to this young man, whom
   abundance [534] rendered fierce and rebellious, hunger proved to be the
   best teacher. Instructed by this example, let us not imagine that God
   deals cruelly with us, if at any time he visits us with heavy
   afflictions; for in this manner those who were obstinate and
   intoxicated with mirth are taught by him to be obedient. In short, all
   the miseries which we endure are a profitable invitation to repentance.
   [535] But as we are slow, we scarcely ever regain a sound mind, unless
   when we are forced by extreme distress; for until we are pressed by
   difficulties on every hand, and shut up to despair, the flesh always
   indulges in gaiety, or at least recoils. Hence we infer, that there is
   no reason to wonder, if the Lord often uses violent and even repeated
   strokes, in order to subdue our obstinacy, and, as the proverb runs,
   applies hard wedges to hard knots. It must also be observed, that the
   hope of bettering his condition, if he returned to his father, gave
   this young man courage to repent; for no severity of punishment will
   soften our depravity, or make us displeased with our sins, till we
   perceive some advantage. As this young man, therefore, is induced by
   confidence in his father's kindness to seek reconciliation, so the
   beginning of our repentance must be an acknowledgment of the mercy of
   God to excite in us favorable hopes.

   20. And while he was still afar off. This is the main point of the
   parable. If men, who are by nature prone to revenge, and too tenacious
   of their own rights, are moved by fatherly love kindly to forgive their
   children, and freely to bring them back, when they are sunk in
   wretchedness, God, whose boundless goodness exceeds all the affection
   of parents, [536] will not treat us more harshly. [537] And certainly
   nothing is here attributed to an earthly father which God does not
   promise with respect to himself. Before they call, says he, I will
   answer, (Isaiah 65:24.) That passage too of David is well known,

   I said, I will acknowledge against me my unrighteousness to the Lord
   and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin,
   (Psalm 32:5.)

   As this father, therefore, is not merely pacified by the entreaties of
   his son, but meets him when he is coming, and before he has heard a
   word, embraces him, filthy and ugly as he is, so God does not wait for
   a long prayer, but of his own free will meets the sinner as soon as he
   proposes to confess his fault.

   It is wretched sophistry to infer from this, that the grace of God is
   not exhibited to sinners until they anticipate it by their repentance.
   "Here," say they, "is held out to us a father ready to pardon, but it
   is after that his son has begun to return to him; and therefore God
   does not look, and does not bestow his grace, on any but those who
   begin to seek him." It is, no doubt, true that, in order to his
   obtaining pardon, the sinner is required to have grief of conscience,
   and to be dissatisfied with himself; but it is wrong to infer from
   this, that repentance, which is the gift of God, is yielded by men from
   their own movement of their heart. And in this respect it would be
   improper to compare a mortal man to God; for it is not in the power of
   an earthly father to renew the stubborn heart of his son, as God
   changes hearts of stone into hearts of flesh. In short, the question
   here is not whether a man is converted by himself, and returns to him;
   but only under the figure of a man is commended the fatherly gentleness
   of God, and his readiness to grant forgiveness.

   21. Father, I have sinned against heaven. Here is pointed out another
   branch of repentance, namely, such a conviction of sin as is
   accompanied by grief and shame. For he who is not grieved for having
   sinned, and whose offense is not placed before his eyes, will sooner
   attempt any thing than think of returning to the path of duty.
   Displeasure with sin must therefore go before repentance. And there is
   great emphasis in this expression, that the young man is said to have
   come to himself, as one whom the wanderings of wild desires had hurried
   away into forgetfulness of himself. And certainly so far astray are the
   impulses of the flesh, that any one who gives himself up to them may be
   said to have gone out of himself, and to have lost his senses. For this
   reason transgressors are commanded to return to the heart, [538]
   (Isaiah 46:8.) Next follows a confession, [539] not such a one as the
   Pope has contrived, but one by which the son appeases his offended
   father; for this humility is absolutely necessary in order to obtain
   forgiveness of sins. This mode of expression, I have sinned against
   heaven, and before thee, is of the same import as if he had said, that
   God was offended in the person of an earthly father. And certainly this
   is the dictate of nature, that every one who rebels against a father
   rises wickedly also against God, who has placed children in subjection
   to parents.

   22. Bring out the best robe. Although in parables (as we have
   frequently observed) it would be idle to follow out every minute
   circumstance, yet it will be no violence to the literal meaning, if we
   say, that our heavenly Father not only pardons our sins in such a
   manner as to bury the remembrance of them, but even restores those
   gifts of which we had been deprived; as, on the other hand, by taking
   them from us, he chastises our ingratitude in order to make us feel
   ashamed at the reproach and disgrace of our nakedness.

   Luke 15:25-32

   Luke 15:25-32

   25. Now his elder son was in the field; and when he came and drew near
   to the house, he heard music and dancing. 26. And he called one of his
   servants, and asked what those things were. [540] 27. And he said to
   him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf,
   because he hath received him safe and sound. [541] 28. And he was
   angry, and would not go in: therefore his father went out, and
   entreated him. 29. But he answering said to his father, Behold, during
   so many years I serve thee, and never have I transgressed thy
   commandment; and thou never gavest me a kid, that I might be merry with
   my friends: 30. But after that this thy son, who hath devoured thy
   property with harlots, is come, thou hast killed for him the fatted
   calf. 31. But he said to him, Son, [542] thou art always with me, and
   all my property is thine. 32. But it was proper that we should be merry
   and rejoice; because this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; he
   was lost, and is found.



   This latter portion of the parable charges those persons with cruelty,
   who would wickedly choose to set limits to the grace of God, as if they
   envied the salvation of wretched sinners. For we know that this is
   pointed at the haughtiness of the scribes, [543] who did not think that
   they received the reward due to their merits, if Christ admitted
   publicans and the common people to the hope of the eternal inheritance.
   The substance of it therefore is, that, if we are desirous to be
   reckoned the children of God, we must forgive in a brotherly manner the
   faults of brethren, which He forgives with fatherly kindness.

   25. And his elder son was in the field. Those who think that, under the
   figure of the first-born son, the Jewish nation is described, have
   indeed some argument on their side; but I do not think that they attend
   sufficiently to the whole of the passage. For the discourse was
   occasioned by the murmuring of the scribes, who took offense at the
   kindness of Christ towards wretched persons who had led a wicked life.
   He therefore compares the scribes, who were swelled with presumption,
   to good and modest men, who had always lived with decency and sobriety,
   and had honorably supported their family; nay, even to obedient
   children, who throughout their whole life had patiently submitted to
   their father's control. And though they were utterly unworthy of this
   commendation, yet Christ, speaking according to their belief,
   attributes to them, by way of concession, their pretended holiness, as
   if it had been virtue; as if he had said, Though I were to grant to you
   what you falsely boast of, that you have always been obedient children
   to God, still you ought not so haughtily and cruelly to reject your
   brethren, when they repent of their wicked life.

   28. Therefore his father went out. By these words he reproaches
   hypocrites with intolerable pride, which makes it necessary that the
   Father should entreat them not to envy the compassion manifested to
   their brethren. Now though God does not entreat, yet by his example he
   exhorts us to bear with the faults of our brethren. And in order to
   take away every excuse from wicked severity, he not only introduces
   hypocrites as speaking, whose false boasting might be confuted, but
   even affirms that, though any man had discharged, in the most perfect
   manner, all the duties of piety towards the Father, yet he has no just
   reason to complain because his brother obtains pardon. It is certain,
   indeed, that the sincere worshippers of God are always pure and free
   from this malignant disposition; but the design of Christ is, to show
   that it would be unjust in any man to murmur on account of his brother
   having been received into favor, even though he were not inferior in
   holiness to the angels.

   31. Son, [544] thou art always with me. This answer consists of two
   parts. The first is, that the first-born son has no reason to be angry,
   when he sees his brother kindly received without any loss to himself;
   [545] and the second is, that, without paying any regard to his
   brother's safety, he is grieved on account of the rejoicing occasioned
   by his return. All my property, says he, is thine: that is, "Though
   thou hast hitherto carried nothing away out of my house, it has been no
   loss to the for all is reserved for thee undiminished." [546] Besides,
   why art thou offended at our joy, in which thou oughtest to have
   shared? for it was proper that thy brother, who we thought had been
   lost, should now be congratulated on his safety and return. Those two
   reasons deserve our attention; for, on the one hand, it is no loss to
   us, [547] if God graciously receives into favor those who had been at
   variance with him on account of their sins; and, on the other hand, it
   is wicked hardness of heart not to rejoice, when we see our brethren
   returned from death to life. [548]

   Matthew 18:15-20; Luke 17:3

   Matthew 18:15-20

   Luke 17:3

   15. But if thy brother hath sinned against thee, go and reprove him
   between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy
   brother. 16. But if he shall not hear thee, take with thee one or two
   more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be
   confirmed: and if he shall not hear them, tell the church. 17. And if
   he shall not hear the church, let him be to thee as a heathen and a
   publican. 18. Verily, I say to thee, What things soever you shall bind
   on earth [549] shall be bound also in heaven; and what things soever
   you shall loose on earth shall be loosed also in heaven. 19. Again, I
   say to you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as to every thing
   which they shall ask, [550] it will be done to them by any Father who
   is in heaven. 20. For where two or three are assembled [551] in my
   name, there am I in the midst of them.


   3. Be on your guard. If thy brother shall sin against thee, reprove
   him; and if he shall repent, forgive him.



   Matthew 18:15. But if thy brother shall sin against thee. As he had
   discoursed about bearing the infirmities of brethren, he now shows more
   clearly in what manner, and for what purpose, and to what extent, we
   ought to bear with them. For otherwise it would have been easy to
   reply, that there is no other way of avoiding offenses, than by every
   man winking at the faults of others, and thus what is evil would be
   encouraged by forbearance. Christ therefore prescribes a middle course,
   which does not give too great offense to the weak, and yet is adapted
   to cure their diseases; for that severity which is employed as a
   medicine is profitable and worthy of praise. In short, Christ enjoins
   his disciples to forgive one another, but to do so in such a manner as
   to endeavor to correct their faults. It is necessary that this be
   wisely observed; for nothing is more difficult than to exercise
   forbearance towards men, and, at the same time, not to neglect the
   freedom necessary in reproving them. [552] Almost all lean to the one
   side or to the other, either to deceive themselves mutually by deadly
   flatteries, or to pursue with excessive bitterness those whom they
   ought to cure. But Christ recommends to his disciples a mutual love,
   which is widely distant from flattery; only he enjoins them to season
   their admonitions with moderation, lest, by excessive severity and
   harshness, they discourage the weak.

   Now he distinctly lays down three steps of brotherly correction. The
   first is, to give a private advice to the person who has offended. The
   second is, if he shall give any sign of obstinacy, to advise him again
   in presence of witnesses. The third is, if no advantage shall be
   obtained in that way, to deliver him up to the public decision of the
   Church. The design of this, as I have said, is, to hinder charity from
   being violated under the pretence of fervent zeal. As the greater part
   of men are driven by ambition to publish with excessive eagerness the
   faults of their brethren, Christ seasonably meets this fault by
   enjoining us to cover the faults of brethren, as far as lies in our
   power; for those who take pleasure in the disgrace and infamy of
   brethren are unquestionably carried away by hatred and malice, since,
   if they were under the influence of charity, they would endeavor to
   prevent the shame of their brethren.

   But it is asked, Ought this rule to be extended indiscriminately to
   every kind of offense? For there are very many who do not allow any
   public censures, till the offender has been privately admonished. But
   there is an obvious limitation in the words of Christ; for he does not
   simply, and without exception, order us to advise or reprove privately,
   and in the absence of witnesses, all who have offended, but bids us
   attempt this method, when we have been offended in private; by which is
   meant, not that it is a business of our own, but that we ought to be
   wounded and grieved whenever God is offended. And Christ does not now
   speak about bearing injuries, but teaches us in general to cultivate
   such meekness towards each other, as not to ruin by harsh treatment
   those whom we ought to save. [553]

   Against thee. This expression, as is evident from what we have said,
   does not denote an injury committed against any one, but distinguishes
   between secret and open sins. [554] For if any man shall offend against
   the whole Church, Paul enjoins that he be publicly reproved, so that
   even elders shall not be spared; for it is in reference to them that he
   expressly enjoins Timothy, to

   rebuke them publicly in presence of all, and thus to make them a
   general example to others,
   (1 Timothy 5:20.)

   And certainly it would be absurd that he who has committed a public
   offense, so that the disgrace of it is generally known, should be
   admonished by individuals; for if a thousand persons are aware of it,
   he ought to receive a thousand admonitions. The distinction, therefore,
   which Christ expressly lays down, ought to be kept in mind, that no man
   may bring disgrace upon his brother, by rashly, and without necessity,
   divulging secret offenses.

   If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. Christ confirms
   his doctrine by its usefulness and advantage; for it is no small matter
   to gain to God a soul which had been the slave of Satan. And how comes
   it that those who have fallen do not often repent, but because they are
   regarded with hatred, and treated as enemies, and thus acquire a
   character of hardened obstinacy? Nothing, therefore, is more
   appropriate than meekness, which reconciles to God those who had
   departed from him. On the other hand, he who inconsiderately indulges
   in foolish flattery willingly places in jeopardy the salvation of a
   brother, which he had in his hand.

   According to Luke, Christ expressly enjoins us to be satisfied with a
   private reproof, if the brother be brought to repentance Hence, too, we
   infer how necessary it is that mutual freedom of reproof should subsist
   among believers. For, since each of us in many ways commits daily
   offenses, it would be outrageous cruelty to betray, by our silence and
   concealment, the salvation of those whom we might, by mild reproof,
   rescue from perdition. Though it does not always succeed, yet he is
   chargeable with heinous guilt, who has neglected the remedy which the
   Lord prescribes for promoting the salvation of the brethren. It is also
   worthy of notice, that the Lord, in order to render us more zealous in
   performing our duty, ascribes to us that honor which is his own; for to
   him alone, and to no other, does it belong to convert a man; and yet he
   bestows on us this applause, though we did not deserve it, that we gain
   a brother who was lost.

   16. But if he shall not hear thee. The second step is, that he who
   displayed obstinacy, or refused to yield to one man, should be again
   admonished in presence of witnesses Here some object, that it will
   serve no purpose to call witnesses, if we have to deal with an
   obstinate and rebellious man, because their presence will be so far
   from leading him to acknowledge his guilt, that he will only make a
   more wicked denial. But this difficulty will be speedily removed, if we
   distinguish between denial and evasion. He who explicitly denies the
   fact, and declares that he is falsely and calumniously accused, must be
   left alone; for it would be ill vain to press him by calling witnesses.
   But as, in most cases, men shamelessly evade, or impudently excuse, the
   improper and unjust actions which they have committed, till greater
   authority is employed, towards such persons it is useful to observe
   this method.

   That Christ's discourse ought to be understood in this sense is evident
   from the word used, elenxon, reprove, or argue; for to argue is to
   convince by demonstration. [555] And how could I argue with a man [556]
   who boldly denies the whole matter? for he who has the effrontery to
   deny the crime which he has committed shuts the door against a second
   admonition.

   We now perceive for what purpose Christ proposes to call witnesses. It
   is, to give greater weight and impressiveness to the admonition. As to
   the slightly different meaning to which he has turned the words of
   Moses, it involves no absurdity. Moses forbids sentence to be
   pronounced on a matter that is unknown, and defines this to be the
   lawful mode of proving, that it be established by the testimony of

   two or three witnesses. At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth
   of three witnesses, shall the matter be established,
   (Deuteronomy 19:15.)

   Alluding to that law, Christ says that, when two or three witnesses
   shall rise up to condemn the obstinacy of the man, the case will be
   clear, at least till the Church be prepared to take cognizance of it;
   for he who refuses to hear two or three witnesses [557] will have no
   reason to complain that he is dragged forth to light.

   Tell it to the Church. It is asked, what does he mean by the term
   Church? For Paul orders (1 Corinthians 5:5) that the incestuous
   Corinthian shall be excommunicated, not by a certain chosen number, but
   by the whole assembly of the godly; and therefore it might appear to be
   probable that the power of judging is bestowed on the whole of the
   people. But as at that time no Church as yet was in existence, which
   acknowledged the authority of Christ, and no such order had been
   established, and as our Lord employs the ordinary and received forms of
   expression, there can be no doubt that he alludes to the order of the
   ancient Church, as in other places also he accommodates his modes of
   expression to what was known and customary. [558] When he commands
   that:

   the offering, which we intend to present, shall be left at the altar,
   till we are reconciled to an offended brother,
   (Matthew 5:23,)

   he unquestionably intends, by means of that form of the worship of God
   which was then in existence and in force, to teach us, that we cannot
   in a right manner either pray, or offer any thing to God, so long as we
   are at variance with our brethren. So then he now looked at the form of
   discipline which was observed among the Jews; for it would have been
   absurd to propose an appeal to the judgment of a Church which was not
   yet in existence.

   Now since among the Jews the power of excommunication belonged to the
   elders, who held the government of the whole Church, Christ speaks
   appropriately when he says that they who sinned must at length be
   brought forward publicly to the Church, if they either despise
   haughtily, or ridicule and evade, the private admonitions. We know
   that, after the Jews returned from the Babylonish captivity, a council
   was formed, which they called Sanhedrim, and in Greek Synedrion,
   (sunedrion) and that to this council was committed the superintendence
   of morals and of doctrine. This government was lawful and approved by
   God, and was a bridle to restrain within their duty the dissolute and
   incorrigible.

   It will perhaps be objected that, in the time of Christ, every thing
   was corrupt and perverted, so that this tyranny was very far from
   deserving to be accounted the judgment of the Church But the reply is
   easy. Though the method of procedure was at that time depraved and
   perverted, yet Christ justly praises that order, such as it had been
   handed down to them from the fathers. And when, shortly afterwards, he
   erected a Church, while he removed the abuse, he restored the proper
   use of excommunication. Yet there is no reason to doubt that the form
   of discipline, which prevailed in the kingdom of Christ, succeeded in
   the room of that ancient discipline. And certainly, since even heathen
   nations maintained a shadowy form of excommunication, it appears that,
   from the beginning, this was impressed by God on the minds of men, that
   those who were impure and polluted ought to be excluded from religious
   services. [559] It would therefore have been highly disgraceful to the
   people of God to have been altogether destitute of that discipline,
   some trace of which remained among the Gentiles. But what had been
   preserved under the Law Christ has conveyed to us, because we hold the
   same rank with the ancient fathers. For it was not the intention of
   Christ to send his disciples to the synagogue, which, while it
   willingly cherished in its bosom disgraceful filth, excommunicated the
   true and sincere worshippers of God; but he reminded us that the order,
   which had been formerly established in a holy manner under the Law,
   must be maintained in his Church.

   Let him be to thee as a heathen and a publican. What is here added as
   to heathens and publicans confirms the interpretation which I have
   given. For heathens and publicans having been at that time regarded by
   the Jews with the greatest hatred and detestation, he compares to them
   unholy and irreclaimable men, who yield to no admonitions. Certainly he
   did not intend to enjoin them to avoid the society of heathens, of whom
   the Church was afterwards composed; nor is there any reason at the
   present day why believers should shrink from associating with
   publicans. But in order that he might be more easily understood by the
   ignorant, Christ borrowed a mode of expression from what was then
   customary among his nation; [560] and the meaning is, that we ought to
   have no intercourse with the despisers of the Church till they repent.

   18. What things soever you shall bind. He now repeats the same words
   which he had formerly used, (Matthew 16:19,) but in a different sense;
   for there he intended to maintain their authority in doctrine, but here
   he appoints discipline, which is an appendage to doctrine. There Christ
   declared that the preaching of the Gospel would not be without effect,
   but that the odor of it would either be life-giving or deadly, (2
   Corinthians 2:15,16:) here he affirms that, though wicked men ridicule
   the judgment of the Church, it will not be ineffectual. We must attend
   to this distinction, that there our Lord's discourse relates to the
   preached word, but here to public censures and discipline. Let the
   reader go to that passage for the import of the metaphor, binding and
   loosing. [561]

   The substance of it is this: Whoever, after committing a crime, humbly
   confesses his fault, and entreats the Church to forgive him, is
   absolved not only by men, but by God himself; and, on the other hand,
   whoever treats with ridicule the reproofs and threatenings of the
   Church, if he is condemned by her, the decision which men have given
   will be ratified in heaven. If it be objected, that in this way God is
   made a sort of petty judge, who concurs in the sentence of mortal men,
   the reply is at hand. For when Christ maintains the authority of his
   Church, he does not diminish his own power or that of his Father, but,
   on the contrary, supports the majesty of his word. As in the former
   case (Matthew 16:19) he did not intend to confirm indiscriminately
   every kind of doctrine, but only that which had proceeded out of his
   mouth, so neither does he say in this place that every kind of decision
   will be approved and ratified, but only that in which he presides, and
   that too not only by his Spirit, but by his word. Hence it follows,
   that men do no injury to the authority of God, when they pronounce
   nothing but what comes from his mouth, and only endeavor faithfully to
   execute what he has commanded. For, though Christ alone is the Judge of
   the world, yet he chooses to have ministers to proclaim his word. [562]
   Besides, he wishes that his own decision should be pronounced by the
   Church; and thus he takes nothing from his own authority by employing
   the ministry of men, but it is Himself alone that looses and binds.

   But here a question arises. Since the Church endures many hypocrites,
   and likewise absolves (or looses) many whose professions of repentance
   are hypocritical, does it follow that such persons will be absolved (or
   loosed) in heaven? I reply, the discourse is addressed to those only
   who are truly and sincerely reconciled to the Church. For Christ,
   wishing to administer comfort to trembling consciences, and to relieve
   them from fear, declares that any who may have offended are freed from
   guilt in the sight of God, provided that they be reconciled to the
   Church. For he has appointed this as the pledge of heavenly grace,
   which has no reference to hypocrites, who pervert the proper use of
   reconciliation, but awakens in the godly no ordinary confidence, when
   they hear that their sins are blotted out before God and angels, as
   soon as they have obtained forgiveness from the Church.

   In the other clause, Christ's meaning is not at all ambiguous; for,
   since obstinate and haughty men are strongly inclined to despise the
   decision of the Church on this pretense, that they refuse to be subject
   to men -- as wicked profligates often make bold appeals to the heavenly
   tribunal [563] -- Christ, in order to subdue this obstinacy by terror,
   threatens that the condemnation, which is now despised by them, will be
   ratified in heaven. He encourages his followers, at the same time, to
   maintain proper severity, and not to yield to the wicked obstinacy of
   those who reject or shake off discipline. [564]

   Hence, too, we may see how absurdly the Papists torture this passage to
   cloak every species of tyranny. That the right of excommunication is
   granted to the Church is certain, and is acknowledged by every person
   of sound judgment; but does it follow that any individual, even though
   not called by the Church, but elected [565] by a mitered and disguised
   beast, shall at his own caprice throw out the useless squibs of
   excommunications? [566] On the contrary, it is evident that the lawful
   government of the Church is committed to elders, and not only to the
   ministers of the word, but to those also who, taken from among the
   people, have been added to them for the superintendence of morals. And
   yet, not satisfied with this impudence, they endeavor even to prove
   from this passage that we must bear all the burdens which they shall
   impose. I do not mention that the power which has been granted to the
   Church is basely seized and carried off by those outrageous enemies of
   the Church; and I only mention that, since Christ speaks only about
   correcting offenders, those who by their laws ensnare souls are
   chargeable with not less folly than wickedness in abusing this passage.
   Of the same stamp is their defense of their auricular confession on
   this pretense; for if Christ intended that those who by their own fault
   had been brought even to a public sentence should be reconciled to the
   Church, he does not therefore lay an obligations [567] on every
   individual to pour his sins into the ear of the priest. But their
   fooleries are so ridiculous, that it is unnecessary to spend any longer
   time in refuting them.

   19. Again I say to you. He confirms the former statement; for not only
   will God bestow the spirit of wisdom and prudence on those who ask it,
   but he will also provide that not one thing which they shall do
   according to his word shall want its power and effect. By uniting
   agreement with prayer, he reminds us with what moderation and humility
   believers ought to conduct themselves in all religious acts. [568] The
   offender must be admonished, and, if he does not receive correction, he
   must be excommunicated. Here it is not only necessary to ask counsel at
   the sacred mouth of God, so that nothing may be determined but by his
   word, but it is proper at the same time to begin with prayer. Hence
   appears more clearly what I have formerly stated, that men are not
   allowed the liberty of doing whatever they please, [569] but that God
   is declared to have the sole claim to the government of the Church, so
   that he approves and ratifies the decisions of which he is himself the
   Author. Meanwhile, when believers assemble, they are taught to unite
   their prayers and to pray in common, not only to testify the unity of
   faith, but that God may listen to the agreement of them all. So then,
   as God frequently promises in other passages that he will graciously
   listen to the private requests of each individual, so here Christ makes
   a remarkable promise to public prayers, in order to invite us more
   earnestly to the practice of them.

   20. For where two or three are assembled in my name. This promise is
   more extensive than the former; for the Lord declares that he will be
   present,

   wherever two or three are met together in his name,
   to guide them by his counsel, (Psalm 73:24,)

   and to conduct to a prosperous result whatever they shall undertake.
   There is therefore no reason to doubt that those who give themselves up
   to his direction will derive most desirable advantage from his
   presence. And since it is an invaluable blessing to have Christ for our
   director in all our affairs, to bless our deliberations and their
   results; and since, on the other hand, nothing can be more miserable
   than to be deprived of his grace, this promise ought to add no small
   excitement to us to unite with each other in piety and holiness. [570]
   For whoever either disregards the holy assemblies, or separates himself
   from brethren, and takes little interest in the cultivation of unity,
   by this alone makes it evident that he sets no value on the presence of
   Christ.

   But we must take care, first of all, that those who are desirous to
   have Christ present with them shall assemble in his name; and we must
   likewise understand what is the meaning of this expression; for we
   perceive how ungodly men falsely and impudently, as well as wickedly,
   cover their conspiracies with his sacred name. If therefore we do not
   wish to expose Christ to their ridicule, and at the same time to
   overturn what he has here promised, we must know first of all what is
   meant by this phrase. It means that those who are assembled together,
   laying aside every thing that hinders them from approaching to Christ,
   shall sincerely raise their desires to him, shall yield obedience to
   his word, and allow themselves to be governed by the Spirit. Where this
   simplicity prevails, there is no reason to fear that Christ will not
   make it manifest that it was not in vain for the assembly to meet in
   his name

   In this is displayed the gross ignorance of the Papists, who exclaim
   that Councils could not err, and that all ought to abide by their
   decisions, because, as often as two or three are assembled in the name
   of Christ, he is in the midst of them. But we ought first of all to
   inquire whether those persons, as to whose faith, and doctrine, and
   dispositions, we are in doubt, were assembled in the name of Christ.
   When the Papists leave out or perplex this matter, who does not see
   that they dexteroasly confound the distinction between holy and profane
   assemblies, so that the power of doing any thing is taken from the
   Church and conveyed to the sworn enemies of Christ? Let us therefore
   know that none but the pious worshippers of God, who sincerely seek
   Christ, are encouraged to entertain the confident hope that he will
   never leave them. Disregarding the bastard and abortive Councils, which
   out of their own head have woven a web, let Christ alone, with the
   doctrine of his Gospel, be always exalted amongst us.

   Matthew 18:21-35 Luke 17:4

   Matthew 18:21-35

   Luke 17:4

   21. Then Peter approaching him said, Lord, how often shall my brother
   offend against me, and I forgive him? Till seven times? 22. Jesus saith
   to him, I say not to thee till seven times, but till seventy times
   seven. 23. Therefore the kingdom of heaven is compared to a king, who
   wished to make a reckoning with his servants. 24. And when he had begun
   to reckon, one was brought to him who owed ten thousand talents.
   25. But as he was unable to pay, his master commanded him to be sold,
   and his wife and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
   26. And that servant falling down, entreated him, saying, Master, have
   patience with me, and I will pay thee all. 27. And his master, pitying
   that servant, forgave him, and acquitted him of the debt. 28. But that
   servant, having gone out, found one of his fellow-servants, who owed
   him a hundred pence: and laying hands on him, saying, Pay me what thou
   owest. 29. And his fellow-servant, fallind down, entreated him, saying,
   Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. 30. But he would not,
   but went out, and threw him into prison, till he should pay the debt.
   31. And when his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were deeply
   grieved, and came, and related to their master all that had been done.
   32. Then his master called him, and said to him, Wicked servant, I
   forgave thee all that debt, because thou didst implore me: 33. Oughtest
   not thou also to pity thy fellow-servant, even as I pitied thee?
   34. And his master, being enraged, delivered him to the tormentors,
   till he should pay all that he owed him. 35. So likewise shall my
   heavenly Father do to you, if you forgive not every one his brother
   from your hearts their offenses.


   4. And if seven times in a day he shall offend against thee, and seven
   times in a day he shall turn to thee, saying, I repent, forgive him.



   Matthew 18:21. Lord, how often shall my brother offend against me?
   Peter made this objection according to the natural feelings and
   disposition of the flesh. It is natural to all men to wish to be
   forgiven; and, therefore, if any man does not immediately obtain
   forgiveness, he complains that he is treated with sternness and
   cruelty. But those who demand to be treated gently are far from being
   equally gentle towards others; and therefore, when our Lord exhorted
   his disciples to meekness, this doubt occurred to Peter: "If we be so
   strongly disposed to grant forgiveness, what will be the consequence,
   but that our lenity shall be an inducement to offend?" [571] He asks,
   therefore, if it be proper frequently to forgive offenders; for, since
   the number seven is taken for a large number, the force of the adverb,
   (heptakis) seven times, is the same as if he had said, "How long, Lord,
   dost thou wish that offenders be received into favor? for it is
   unreasonable, and by no means advantageous, that they should, in every
   case, find us willing to be reconciled." But Christ is so far from
   yielding to this objection, that he expressly declares that there ought
   to be no limit to forgiving; [572] for he did not intend to lay down a
   fixed number, but rather to enjoin us never to become wearied.

   Luke differs somewhat from Matthew; for he states the command of Christ
   to be simply, that we should be prepared to forgive seven times; but
   the meaning is the same, that we ought to be ready and prepared to
   grant forgiveness not once or twice, but as often as the sinner shall
   repent There is only this difference between them, that, according to
   Matthew, our Lord, in reproving Peter for taking too limited a view,
   employs hyperbolically a larger number, which of itself is sufficient
   to point out the substance of what is intended. For when Peter asked if
   he should forgive seven times, it was not because he did not choose to
   go any farther, but, by presenting the appearance of a great absurdity,
   to withdraw Christ from his opinion, as I have lately hinted. So then
   he who shall be prepared to forgive seven times will be willing to be
   reconciled as far as to the seventieth offense.

   But the words of Luke give rise to another question; for Christ does
   not order us to grant forgiveness, till the offender turn to us and
   give evidence of repentance. [573] I reply, there are two ways in which
   offenses are forgiven. If a man shall do me an injury, and I, laying
   aside the desire of revenge, do not cease to love him, but even repay
   kindness in place of injury, though I entertain an unfavorable opinion
   of him, as he deserves, still I am said to forgive him. For when God
   commands us to wish well to our enemies, He does not therefore demand
   that we approve in them what He condemns, but only desires that our
   minds shall be purified from all hatred. In this kind of pardon, so far
   are we from having any right to wait till he who has offended shall
   return of his own accord to be reconciled to us, that we ought to love
   those who deliberately provoke us, who spurn reconciliation, and add to
   the load of former offenses. A second kind of forgiving is, when we
   receive a brother into favor, so as to think favorably respecting him,
   and to be convinced that the remembrance of his offense is blotted out
   in the sight of God. And this is what I have formerly remarked, that in
   this passage Christ does not speak only of injuries which have been
   done to us, but of every kind of offenses; for he desires that, by our
   compassion, we shall raise up those who have fallen. [574] This
   doctrine is very necessary, because naturally almost all of us are
   peevish beyond measure; and Satan, under the pretense of severity,
   drives us to cruel rigor, so that wretched men, to whom pardon is
   refused, are swallowed up by grief and despair.

   But here another question arises. As soon as a man by words makes
   profession of repentance, are we bound to believe him? Were this done,
   we must of necessity go willingly and knowingly into mistake; for where
   will be discretion, if any man may freely impose on us, even to the
   hundredth offense? I answer, first, the discourse relates here to daily
   faults, in which every man, even the best, needs forgiveness. [575]
   Since, then, amidst such infirmity of the flesh, our road is so
   slippery, and snares and attacks so numerous what will be the
   consequence if, at the second or third fall, the hope of forgiveness is
   cut off? We must add, secondly, that Christ does not deprive believers
   of the exercise of judgment, so as to yield a foolish readiness of
   belief to every slight expression, but only desires us to be so candid
   and merciful, as to stretch out the hand to offenders, provided there
   be evidence that they are sincerely dissatisfied with their sins. For
   repentance is a sacred thing, and therefore needs careful examination;
   but as soon as the offender gives probable evidence of conversion,
   Christ desires that he shall be admitted to reconciliation, lest, on
   being repulsed, he lose courage and fall back.

   Thirdly, It must be observed that, when any man, through his light and
   unsteady behavior, has exposed himself to suspicion, we may grant
   pardon when he asks it, and yet may do so in such a manner as to watch
   over his conduct for the future, that our forbearance and meekness,
   which proceed from the Spirit of Christ, may not become the subject of
   his ridicule. For we must observe the design of our Lord himself, that
   we ought, by our gentleness, to assist those who have fallen to rise
   again. And certainly we ought to imitate the goodness of our heavenly
   Father, who meets sinners at a distance to invite them to salvation.
   Besides, as repentance is a wonderful work of the Spirit, and is the
   creation of the new man, if we despise it, we offer an insult to God
   himself.

   23. The kingdom of heaven is compared. As it is difficult to bend us to
   mercy, and as we are quickly seized with weariness, particularly when
   we have to bear with many faults of brethren, our Lord confirms this
   doctrine by a most appropriate parable, the substance of which is, that
   those who will not yield to pardon the faults of brethren judge very
   ill for themselves, and subject themselves to a very hard and severe
   law; for they will find God to be equally stern and inexorable towards
   themselves. There are three parts in which the resemblance mainly
   consists; for the master is contrasted with the servant, the large sum
   of money with small or ordinary sums, and extraordinary kindness with
   extreme cruelty. By attending to these three points, it will be easy to
   ascertain Christ's meaning; for what are we, if we are compared with
   God? And how large is the sum which every one of us owes to God?
   Lastly, how inconsiderable are the offenses, with which brethren are
   chargeable towards us, if we take into account our obligation to God?
   How ill then does that man deserve the compassion of God, who, though
   oppressed with an immense load, implacably refuses to forgive even the
   smallest offenses to men like himself? So far as regards the words, the
   kingdom of heaven here denotes the spiritual condition of the Church;
   as if Christ had said, that the state of matters between God and men,
   in regard to the soul and the nature of spiritual life, is the same as
   between an ordinary or earthly master and his servants, in regard to
   money and the affairs of the present life.

   25. His master ordered him to be sold. It would be an idle exercise of
   ingenuity to examine here every minute clause. For God does not always
   display severity at first, till, constrained to pray, we implore
   pardon, but rather meets us with undeserved goodness. But Christ only
   shows what will become of us, if God shall treat us with the utmost
   severity; and again, if He shall choose to demand from us what we owe,
   how necessary it is for us to betake ourselves to prayer, because this
   is the only refuge that remains for transgressors. We must also attend
   to the wide difference of the sums; for, since one talent is worth more
   than a hundred pence, what proportion will a hundred pence bear to ten
   thousand talents?

   31. When his fellow-servants saw what was done. Though we ought not to
   search for mystery in these words -- because they contain nothing but
   what nature teaches, and what we learn by daily experience -- we ought
   to know that the men who live among us will be so many witnesses
   against us before God; for it is impossible but that cruelty shall
   excite in them displeasure and hatred, more especially, since every man
   is afraid that what he sees done to others will fall upon his own head.
   As to the clause which immediately follows, it is foolish to inquire
   how God punishes those sins [576] which he has already forgiven; for
   the simple meaning is this: though he offers mercy to all, yet severe
   creditors, from whom no forgiveness can be obtained, are unworthy of
   enjoying it.

   34. Delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that he
   owed. The Papists are very ridiculous in endeavoring to light the fire
   of purgatory by the word till; for it is certain that Christ here
   points out not temporal death, by which the judgment of God may be
   satisfied, but eternal death.

   Matthew 17:24-27

   Matthew 17:24-27

   24. And when they came to Capernaum, those who received the didrachma
   came to Peter, and said, Does not your Master pay the didrachma? 25. He
   saith, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him,
   saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth
   receive tribute or custom? From their own children, or from strangers?
   26. Peter saith to him, From strangers. Jesus saith to him, Then are
   the children free. 27. But that we may not offend them, go thou to the
   sea, throw a hook, and take that fish which cometh first up; and when
   thou hast opened its mouth, thou wilt find a stater: take that, and
   give it for me and for thee.



   Matthew 17:24. And when they came to Capernaum. We must attend, first
   of all, to the design of this narrative; which is, that Christ, by
   paying tribute of his own accord, declared his subjection, as he had
   taken upon him the form of a servant, (Philippians 2:7,) but at the
   same time showed, both by words and by the miracle, that it was not by
   obligation or necessity, but by a free and voluntary submission, that
   he had reduced himself so low that the world looked upon him as nothing
   more than one of the common people. This was not a tax which was wont
   to be demanded on crossing the sea, [577] but an annual tribute laid
   individually on every man among the Jews, so that they paid to tyrants
   what they were formerly in the habit of paying to God alone. For we
   know that this tax was imposed on them by the Law, that, by paying
   every year half a stater, (Exodus 30:13,) they might acknowledge that
   God, by whom they had been redeemed, was their supreme King. When the
   kings of Asia appropriated this to themselves, the Romans followed
   their example. Thus the Jews, as if they had disowned the government of
   God, paid to profane tyrants the sacred tax required by the Law. But it
   might appear unreasonable that Christ, when he appeared as the Redeemer
   of his people, should not himself be exempted from paying tribute To
   remove that offense, he taught by words, that it was only by his will
   that he was bound; and he proved the same thing by a miracle, for he
   who had dominion over the sea and the fishes might have released
   himself from earthly government. [578]

   Doth not your Master pay? Some think that the collectors of the tribute
   intended to throw blame on Christ, as if he were claiming exemption
   from the common law. For my own part, as men of that class are insolent
   and abusive, I interpret these words as having been spoken by way of
   reproach. It was customary for every man to be enrolled in his own
   city; but we know that Christ had no fixed habitation in one place.
   Those people therefore inquire if he be exempted from the law on the
   ground of his frequent removals from place to place. [579]

   25. He saith, Yes. Peter's reply contains a modest excuse [580] to
   satisfy them: "he will pay," [581] says he; from which we infer that
   Christ had formerly been accustomed to pay, for Peter promises it as a
   thing about which there was no doubt. That they address him rather than
   the other disciples was, as I conjecture, because Christ lived with
   him; for if all had occupied the same habitation, the demand would have
   been made on all alike. It is therefore very ridiculous in the Papists,
   on so frivolous a pretense, to make Peter a partner in the dignity of
   Christ. "He chose him (they say) to be his vicar, and bestowed on him
   equal honors, by making him equal to himself in the payment of
   tribute." But in this way they will make all swine-herds vicars of
   Christ, for they paid as much as he did. And if the primacy of Peter
   was manifested in the paying of tribute, whence comes that exemption
   which they claim for themselves? But this is the necessary result of
   the shameful trifling of those who corrupt Scripture according to their
   own fancy.

   What thinkest thou, Simon? In this Christ gave a proof of his Divinity,
   by showing that nothing was unknown to him. But what is the object of
   his discourse? Is it to exempt himself and his followers from
   subjection to the laws? Some explain it thus, that Christians have a
   right to be exempted, but that they voluntarily subject themselves to
   the ordinary government, because otherwise human society cannot be
   maintained. To me, however, the meaning appears to be more simple; for
   there was danger lest the disciples might think that Christ had come in
   vain, because, by paying tribute cut off the hope of deliverance; and
   therefore he simply affirms that he pays tribute, solely because he
   voluntarily refrains from exercising his right and power. Hence it is
   inferred that this takes nothing from his reign. But why does he not
   openly claim his right? It is because his kingly power was unknown to
   the collectors of the tribute. For, though his kingdom be spiritual,
   still we must maintain, that as he is the only Son of God, he is also
   the heir of the whole world, so that all things ought to be subject to
   him, and to acknowledge his authority. The meaning, therefore, is, that
   God has not appointed kings, and established governments over mankind,
   in such a manner as to place him who is the Son in the same rank
   indiscriminately with others, but yet that, of his own accord, he will
   be a servant along with others, till the glory of his kingdom be
   displayed.

   The Pope has not less foolishly than successfully abused this passage
   to exempt his clergy from the laws; as if the shaving of the head made
   them sons of God, and exempted them from tributes and taxes. But
   nothing else was intended by Christ than to claim for himself the honor
   of a King's Son, so as to have at least a home privileged and exempted
   from the common law. And therefore it is also highly foolish in the
   Anabaptists to torture these words for overturning political order,
   since it is more than certain, that Christ does not say any thing about
   a privilege common to believers, but only draws a comparison from the
   sons of kings, who, together with their domestics, are exempted. [582]

   27. Throw a hook. Though I acknowledge that Christ had not always full
   coffers, yet I think that he was not compelled by poverty to give this
   order to Peter, but that he did so in order to prove by a miracle, that
   he had a more extensive dominion than all earthly kings, since he had
   even fishes for his tributaries. And we do not read that this was done
   more than once, because one proof was enough for his whole life. Thou
   wilt find a stater. A stater was of the same value as a shekel, namely,
   four drachms or two didrachma. [583]

   Matthew 19:1-2

   Mark 9:38-40

   Luke 9:49-56

   1. And it happened, when Jesus had finished these discourses, he
   departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judea beyond Jordan.
   2. And great multitudes followed him, and he cured them there.


   38. And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out
   devils in thy name, and he followeth not us; and we forbade him,
   because he followeth him, because he followeth not us. 39. And Jesus
   said, Forbid him not; for there is no man who, if he has performed a
   miracle in my name, can easily speak evil of me. 40. For he who is not
   against us is for us.

   Mark 10:1

   1. And when he had risen thence, he came into the coasts of Judea,
   through the district which is beyond Jordan. And again the multitudes
   assemble to him, and again he taught them, as he was accustomed.


   49. And John answering said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in
   thy name; and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us. 50. And
   Jesus said to him, Forbid him not; for he who is not against us is for
   us. 51. And it happened, when the days of his being received up were in
   course of being fulfilled, and he set his face steadfastly to go to
   Jerusalem. 52. And he sent messengers before his face; and they went
   and entered into a town of the Samaritans, to make ready for him:
   53. And they did not receive him, because his face was as if he were
   going to Jerusalem. [584] 54. And when his disciples James and John saw
   it, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from
   heaven, and consume them, even as Elijah did? 55. And Jesus, turning,
   rebuked them, saying, You know not of what spirit you are. 56. For the
   Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And
   they went into another village.


   Mark 9:38. Master, we saw one. Hence it is evident that the name of
   Christ was at that time so celebrated, that persons who were not of the
   number of his intimate disciples used that name, or perhaps even abused
   it, for I will not venture to avouch any thing on this point as
   certain. It is possible that he who is here mentioned had embraced the
   doctrine of Christ, and betaken himself to the performance of miracles
   with no bad intention; but as Christ bestowed this power on none but
   those whom he had chosen to be heralds of his Gospel, I think that he
   had rashly taken, or rather seized upon, this office. Now though he was
   wrong in making this attempt, and in venturing to imitate the disciples
   without receiving a command to do so, yet his boldness was not without
   success: for the Lord was pleased, in this way also, to throw luster
   around his name, [585] as he sometimes does by means of those of whose
   ministry he does not approve as lawful. It is not inconsistent with
   this to say, that one who was endued with special faith followed a
   blind impulse, and thus proceeded inconsiderately to work miracles.

   I now come to John and his companions. They say that they forbade a man
   to work miracles Why did they not first ask whether or not he was
   authorized? For now being in a state of doubt and suspense, they ask
   the opinion of their Master. Hence it follows, that they had rashly
   taken on themselves the right to forbid; and therefore every man who
   undertakes more than he knows that he is permitted to do by the word of
   God is chargeable with rashness. Besides, there is reason to suspect
   the disciples of Christ of ambition, because they are anxious to
   maintain their privilege and honor. For how comes it that they all at
   once forbid a man who is unknown to them to work miracles, but because
   they wish to be the sole possessors of this right? For they assign the
   reason, that he followeth not Christ; as much as to say, "He is not one
   of thy associates, as we are: why then shall he possess equal honor?"

   39. Forbid him not. Christ did not wish that he should be forbidden;
   not that he had given him authority, or approved of what he did, or
   even wished his disciples to approve of it, but because, when by any
   occurrence God is glorified, we ought to bear with it and rejoice. Thus
   Paul, (Philippians 1:18,) though he disapproves of the dispositions of
   those who used the Gospel as a pretense for aggrandizing themselves,
   yet rejoices that by this occurrence the glory of Christ is advanced.
   We must attend also to the reason which is added, that it is impossible
   for any man who works miracles in the name of Christ to speak evil of
   Christ, and therefore this ought to be reckoned as gain; for hence it
   follows, that if the disciples had not been more devoted to their own
   glory than anxious and desirous to promote the glory of their Master,
   they would not have been offended when they saw that glory heightened
   and enlarged in another direction. And yet Christ declares that we
   ought to reckon as friends those who are not open enemies.

   40. For he who is not against us is for us. He does not enjoin us to
   give a loose rein to rash men, and to be silent while they intermeddle
   with this and the other matter, according to their own fancy, and
   disturb the whole order of the Church: for such licentiousness, so far
   as our calling allows, must be restrained. He only affirms that they
   act improperly, who unseasonably prevent the kingdom of God from being
   advanced by any means whatever. And yet he does not acknowledge as his
   disciples, or reckon as belonging to his flock, those who hold an
   intermediate place between enemies and friends, but means that,. so far
   as they do no harm, they are useful and profitable: for it is a
   proverbial saying, which reminds us that we ought not to raise a
   quarrel till we are constrained.

   Luke 9:51. While the days of his being received up, etc. Luke alone
   relates this narrative, which, however, is highly useful on many
   accounts. For, first, it describes the divine courage and firmness of
   Christ [586] in despising death; secondly, what deadly enmities are
   produced by differences about religion; thirdly, with what headlong
   ardor the nature of man is hurried on to impatience; next, how ready we
   are to fall into mistakes in imitating the saints; and, lastly, by the
   example of Christ we are called to the exercise of meekness. The death
   of Christ is called his being received up, (analepsis) not only because
   he was then withdrawn from the midst of us, [587] but because, leaving
   the mean prison of the flesh, he ascended on high.

   52. And he sent messengers. It is probable that our Lord was, at that
   time, attended by a great multitude of followers; for the messengers
   were not sent to prepare a splendid banquet, or to select some
   magnificent palace, but only to tell that a vast number of guests were
   approaching. They again, when excluded and repulsed, wait for their
   Master. Hence, too, we learn, what I remarked in the second place,
   [588] that when men differ among themselves about the doctrines of
   religion, they readily break out into hatred of each other; for it was
   an evidence of very bitter hatred to withhold food from the hungry, and
   lodging from those who were fatigued. But the Samaritans have such a
   dislike and enmity at the Jewish religion, that they look upon all who
   follow it as unworthy of any kindness. Perhaps, too, they were
   tormented with vexation at being despised; for they knew that their
   temple was detested by the Jews as profane, and that they were
   considered to be spurious and corrupt worshippers of God. But as the
   superstition once admitted kept so firm a hold of them, they strove,
   with wicked emulation, to maintain it to the last. At length the
   contention grew so hot, that it consumed both nations in one
   conflagration; for Josephus assures us that it was the torch which
   kindled the Jewish war. Now though Christ might easily have avoided
   that dislike, he chooses rather to profess himself to be a Jew, than by
   an indirect denial to procure a lodging.

   53. He steadfastly set his face. By this expression Luke has informed
   us that Christ, when he had death before his eyes, rose above the fear
   of it, and went forward to meet it; but, at the same time, points out
   that he had a struggle, and that, having vanquished terror, [589] he
   boldly presented himself to die. For if no dread, no difficulty, no
   struggle, no anxiety, had been present to his mind, what need was there
   that he should set his face steadfastly? [590] But as he was neither
   devoid of feeling, nor under the influence of foolish hardihood, he
   must have been affected by the cruel and bitter death, or rather the
   shocking and dreadful agony, which he knew would overtake him from the
   rigorous judgment of God; and so far is this from obscuring or
   diminishing his glory, that it is a remarkable proof of his unbounded
   love to us; for laying aside a regard to himself that he might devote
   himself to our salvation, through the midst of terrors he hastened to
   death, the time of which he knew to be at hand.

   54. And when His disciples James and John saw it. The country itself
   had perhaps suggested to them the desire of thundering immediately
   against the ungodly; for it was there that Elijah had formerly
   destroyed, by a fire from heaven, the king's soldiers who had been sent
   to apprehend him, (2 Kings 1:10.) It therefore occurred to them that
   the Samaritans, who so basely rejected the Son of God, were at that
   time devoted to a similar destruction. And here we see to what we are
   driven by a foolish imitation [591] of the holy fathers. James and John
   plead the example of Elijah, but they do not consider how far they
   differ from Elijah; they do not examine properly their own intemperate
   zeal, nor do they look at the calling of God. Under a pretext equally
   plausible did the Samaritans cloak their idolatry, our fathers
   worshipped in this mountain, (John 4:20.) But both were in the wrong;
   for, neglecting the exercise of judgment, they were apes rather than
   imitators of the holy fathers. Now though it is doubtful whether they
   think that they have the power in their own hand, or ask Christ to give
   it to them, I think it more probable that, elated with foolish
   confidence, they entertain no doubt that they are able to execute
   vengeance, provided that Christ give his consent.

   55. You know not of what spirit you are By this reply he not only
   restrained the unbridled fury of the two disciples, but laid down a
   rule to all of us not to indulge our temper. For whoever undertakes any
   thing, ought to be fully aware that he has the authority and guidance
   of the Spirit of God, and that he is actuated by proper and holy
   dispositions. Many will be impelled by the warmth of their zeal, but if
   the spirit of prudence be wanting, their ebullitions end in foam.
   Frequently, too, it happens, that the impure feelings of the flesh are
   mingled with their zeal, and that those who appear to be the keenest
   zealots for the glory of God are blinded by the private feelings of the
   flesh. And therefore, unless our zeal be directed by the Spirit of God,
   it will be of no avail to plead in our behalf, that we undertook
   nothing but from proper zeal. But the Spirit himself will guide us by
   wisdom and prudence, that we may do nothing contrary to our duty, or
   beyond our calling, nothing, in short, but what is prudent and
   seasonable; and, by removing all the filth of the flesh, he may impart
   to our minds proper feelings, that we may desire nothing but what God
   shall suggest. Christ likewise blames his disciples because, though
   they are widely distant from the spirit of Elijah, [592] they rashly
   take upon themselves to do what he did. For Elijah executed the
   judgment of God, which had been committed to him by the Spirit; but
   they rush to vengeance, not by the command of God, but by the movement
   of the flesh. And therefore the examples of the saints are no defense
   to us, unless the same Spirit that directed them dwell in us.

   Matthew 19:3-9

   Mark 10:2-12

   3. And the Pharisees came to him, tempting him, and saying to him, Is
   it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause whatever? 4. Who
   answering said to them, Have you not read, that he who made them at
   first, [593] made them male and female? 5. And he said, Therefore shall
   a man leave his father and mother, and be joined to his wife; and they
   shall be one flesh. 6. Therefore now they are not two, but one flesh:
   what God therefore hath joined, let not man separate. 7. They say to
   him, Why then did Moses order to give a letter of divorcement, and send
   her away? 8. He said to them, Moses, for the hardness of your heart,
   permitted you to divorce your wives; but at the beginning it was not
   so. 9. And I say to you, That whosoever shall divorce his wife, except
   for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery; and
   whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.


   2. And the Pharisees, coming to him, asked him, Is it lawful for a man
   to divorce his wife? tempting him. 3. But he answering said to them,
   What did Moses command you? 4. And they said, Moses permitted to write
   a letter of divorcement, and to send her away. 5. And Jesus answering
   said to them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote to you this
   commandment. 6. But at the beginning of the creation God made them male
   and female. 7. For this reason shall a man leave his father and mother,
   and cleave to his wife; 8. And they shall be one flesh: therefore now
   they are not two, but one flesh. 9. What therefore God hath joined
   together let not man separate. 10. And in the house his disciples again
   asked him about the same subject. 11. And he saith to them, Whososever
   shall divorce his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against
   her. 12. And if a woman shall divorce her husband, and shall be married
   to another, she committeth adultery.



   Matthew 19:3. And the Pharisees came to him, tempting him. Though the
   Pharisees lay snares for Christ, and cunningly endeavor to impose upon
   him, yet their malice proves to be highly useful to us; as the Lord
   knows how to turn, in a wonderful manner, to the advantage of his
   people all the contrivances of wicked men to overthrow sound doctrine.
   For, by means of this occurrence, a question arising out of the liberty
   of divorce was settled, and a fixed law was laid down as to the sacred
   and indissoluble bond of marriage. The occasion of this quibbling was,
   that the reply, in whatever way it were given, could not, as they
   thought, fail to be offensive.

   They ask, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause
   whatever? If Christ reply in the negative, they will exclaim that he
   wickedly abolishes the Law; and if in the affirmative, they will give
   out that he is not a prophet of God, but rather a pander, who lends
   such countenance to the lust of men. Such were the calculations which
   they had made in their own minds; but the Son of God, who knew how to
   take the wise in their own craftiness, (Job 5:13,) disappointed them,
   sternly opposing unlawful divorces, and at the same time showing that
   he brings forward nothing which is inconsistent with the Law. For he
   includes the whole question under two heads: that the order of creation
   ought to serve for a law, that the husband should maintain conjugal
   fidelity during the whole of life; and that divorces were permitted,
   not because they were lawful, but because Moses had to deal with a
   rebellious and intractable nation.

   4. Have you not read? Christ does not indeed reply directly to what was
   asked, but he fully meets the question which was proposed; just as if a
   person now interrogated about the Mass were to explain faithfully the
   mystery of the Holy Supper, and at length to conclude, that they are
   guilty of sacrilege and forgery who venture either to add or to take
   away any thing from the pure institution of the Lord, he would plainly
   overturn the pretended sacrifice of the Mass. Now Christ assumes as an
   admitted principle, that at the beginning God joined the male to the
   female, so that the two made an entire man; and therefore he who
   divorces his wife tears from him, as it were, the half of himself. But
   nature does not allow any man to tear in pieces his own body.

   He adds another argument drawn from the less to the greater. The bond
   of marriage is more sacred than that which binds children to their
   parents. But piety binds children to their parents by a link which
   cannot be broken. Much less then can the husband renounce his wife.
   Hence it follows, that a chain which God made is burst asunder, if the
   husband divorce his wife. [594]

   Now the meaning of the words is this: God, who created the human race,
   made them male and female, so that every man might be satisfied with
   his own wife, and might not desire more. For he insists on the number
   two, as the prophet Malachi, (2:15,)when he remonstrates against
   polygamy, employs the same argument, that God, whose Spirit was so
   abundant that He had it in His power to create more, yet made but one
   man, that is, such a man as Christ here describes. And thus from the
   order of creation is proved the inviolable union of one husband with
   one wife. If it be objected, that in this way it will not be lawful,
   after the first wife is dead, to take another, the reply is easy, that
   not only is the bond dissolved by death, but the second wife is
   substituted by God in the room of the first, as if she had been one and
   the same woman.

   5. Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother. It is uncertain
   whether Moses represents Adam or God as speaking these words; but it is
   of little consequence to the present passage which of these meanings
   you choose, for it was enough to quote the decision which God had
   pronounced, though it might have been uttered by the mouth of Adam. Now
   he who marries a wife is not commanded absolutely to leave his father;
   for God would contradict himself, if by marriage He set aside those
   duties which He enjoins on children towards their parents; but when a
   comparison is made between the claims, the wife is preferred to the
   father and mother But if any man abandon his father, and shake off the
   yoke by which he is bound, no man will own such a monster; [595] much
   less will he be at liberty to dissolve a marriage.

   And the two shall be one flesh. This expression condemns polygamy not
   less than it condemns unrestrained liberty in divorcing wives; for, if
   the mutual union of two persons was consecrated by the Lord, the
   mixture of three or four persons is unauthorized. [596] But Christ, as
   I stated a little ago, applies it in a different manner to his purpose;
   namely, to show that whoever divorces his wife tears himself in pieces,
   because such is the force of holy marriage, that the husband and wife
   become one man. For it was not the design of Christ to introduce the
   impure and filthy speculation of Plato, but he spoke with reverence of
   the order which God has established. Let the husband and wife,
   therefore, live together in such a manner, that each shall cherish the
   other in the same manner as if they were the half of themselves. Let
   the husband rule, so as to be the head, and not the tyrant, of his
   wife; and let the woman, on the other hand, yield modestly to his
   commands.

   6. What God therefore hath joined. By this sentence Christ restrains
   the caprice of husbands, that they may not, by divorcing their wives,
   burst asunder the sacred knot. And as he declares that it is not in the
   power of the husband to dissolve the marriage, so likewise he forbids
   all others to confirm by their authority unlawful divorces; for the
   magistrate abuses his power when he grants permission to the husband to
   divorce his wife. But the object which Christ had directly in view was,
   that every man should sacredly observe the promise which he has given,
   and that those who are tempted, by wantonness or wicked dispositions,
   to divorce, may reflect thus with themselves: "Who, art thou that
   allowest thyself to burst asunder what God hath joined?" But this
   doctrine may be still farther extended. The Papists, contriving for us
   a church separated from Christ the Head, leave us an imperfect and
   mutilated body. In the Holy Supper, Christ joined the bread and the
   wine; but they have dared to withhold from all the people the use of
   the cup. To these diabolical corruptions we shall be at liberty to
   oppose these words, What God hath joined let not man separate

   7. Why then did Moses order? They had thought of this calumny, [597]
   if, which was more probable, Christ should demand a proper cause to be
   shown in cases of divorce; for it appears that whatever God permits by
   his law, whose will alone establishes the distinction between what is
   good or evil, is lawful. But Christ disarms the falsehood and slander
   by the appropriate reply, that Moses permitted it on account of their
   obstinacy, and not because he approved of it as lawful. And he confirms
   his opinion by the best argument, because it was not so at the
   beginning. He takes for granted that, when God at first instituted
   marriage, he established a perpetual law, which ought to remain in
   force till the end of the world. And if the institution of marriage is
   to be reckoned an inviolable law, it follows that whatever swerves from
   it does not arise from its pure nature, but from the depravity of men.

   But it is asked, Ought Moses to have permitted what was in itself bad
   and sinful? I reply, That, in an unusual sense of the word, he is said
   to have permitted what he did not severely forbid; [598] for he did not
   lay down a law about divorces, so as to give them the seal of his
   approbation, but as the wickedness of men could not be restrained in
   any other way, he applied what was the most admissible remedy, that the
   husband should, at least, attest the chastity of his wife. For the law
   was made solely for the protection of the women, that they might not
   suffer any disgrace after they had been unjustly rejected. Hence we
   infer, that it was rather a punishment inflicted on the husbands, than
   an indulgence or permission fitted to inflame their lust. Besides,
   political and outward order is widely different from spiritual
   government. What is lawful and proper the Lord has comprehended under
   the ten words. [599] Now as it is possible that many things, for which
   every man's conscience reproves and charges him, may not be called in
   question at a human tribunal, it is not wonderful if those things are
   connived at by political laws.

   Let us take a familiar instance. The laws grant to us a greater liberty
   of litigation than the law of charity allows. Why is this? Because the
   right cannot be conferred on individuals, unless there be an open door
   for demanding it; and yet the inward law of God declares that we ought
   to follow what charity shall dictate. And yet there is no reason why
   magistrates should make this an excuse for their indolence, if they
   voluntarily abstain from correcting vices, or neglect what the nature
   of their office demands. But let men in a private station beware of
   doubling the criminality of the magistrates, by screening their own
   vices under the protection of the laws. For here the Lord indirectly
   reproves the Jews for not, reckoning it enough that their stubbornness
   was allowed to pass unpunished, if they did not implicate God as
   defending their iniquity. And if the rule of a holy and pious life is
   not always, or in all places, to be sought from political laws, much
   less ought we to seek it from custom.

   9. But I say to you. Mark relates that this was spoken to the disciples
   apart, when they had come into the house; but Matthew, leaving out this
   circumstance, gives it as a part of the discourse, as the Evangelists
   frequently leave out some intermediate occurrence, because they reckon
   it enough to sum up the leading points. There is therefore no
   difference, except that the one explains the matter more distinctly
   than the other. The substance of it is: though the Law does not punish
   divorces, which are at variance with God's first institution, yet he is
   an adulterer who rejects his wife and takes another. For it is not in
   the power of a man to dissolve the engagement of marriage, which the
   Lord wishes to remain inviolate; and so the woman who occupies the bed
   of a lawful wife is a concubine.

   But an exception is added; for the woman, by fornication, cuts herself
   off, as a rotten member, from her husband, and sets him at liberty.
   Those who search for other reasons ought justly to be set at nought,
   because they choose to be wise above the heavenly teacher. They say
   that leprosy is a proper ground for divorce, because the contagion of
   the disease affects not only the husband, but likewise the children.
   For my own part, while I advise a religious man not to touch a woman
   afflicted with leprosy, I do not pronounce him to be at liberty to
   divorce her. If it be objected, that they who cannot live unmarried
   need a remedy, that they may not be burned, I answer, that what is
   sought in opposition to the word of God is not a remedy. I add too,
   that if they give themselves up to be guided by the Lord, they will
   never want continence, for they follow what he has prescribed. One man
   shall contract such a dislike of his wife, that he cannot endure to
   keep company with her: will polygamy cure this evil? Another man's wife
   shall fall into palsy or apoplexy, or be afflicted with some other
   incurable disease, shall the husband reject her under the pretense of
   incontinency? We know, on the contrary, that none of those who walk in
   their ways are ever left destitute of the assistance of the Spirit.

   For the sake of avoiding fornication, says Paul, let every man marry a
   wife, (1 Corinthians 7:2.) He who has done so, though he may not
   succeed to his wish, has done his duty; and, therefore, if any thing be
   wanting, he will be supported by divine aid. To go beyond this is
   nothing else than to tempt God. When Paul mentions another reason,
   namely, that when, through a dislike of godliness, wives happen to be
   rejected by unbelievers, a godly brother or sister is not, in such a
   case, liable to bondage, (1 Corinthians 7:12,15,) this is not
   inconsistent with Christ's meaning. For he does not there inquire into
   the proper grounds of divorce, but only whether a woman continues to be
   bound to an unbelieving husband, after that, through hatred of God, she
   has been wickedly rejected, and cannot be reconciled to him in any
   other way than by forsaking God; and therefore we need not wonder if
   Paul think it better that she should part with a mortal man than that
   she should be at variance with God.

   But the exception which Christ states appears to be superfluous. For,
   if the adulteress deserve to be punished with death, what purpose does
   it serve to talk of divorces? But as it was the duty of the husband to
   prosecute his wife for adultery, in order to purge his house from
   infamy, whatever might be the result, the husband, who convicts his
   wife of uncleanness, is here freed by Christ from the bond. It is even
   possible that, among a corrupt and degenerate people, this crime
   remained to a great extent unpunished; as, in our own day, the wicked
   forbearance of magistrates makes it necessary for husbands to put away
   unchaste wives, because adulterers are not punished. It must also be
   observed, that the right belongs equally and mutually to both sides, as
   there is a mutual and equal obligation to fidelity. For, though in
   other matters the husband holds the superiority, as to the marriage
   bed, the wife has an equal right: for he is not the lord of his body;
   and therefore when, by committing adultery, he has dissolved the
   marriage, the wife is set at liberty.

   And whosoever shall marry her that is divorced. This clause has been
   very ill explained by many commentators; for they have thought that
   generally, and without exception, celibacy is enjoined in all cases
   when a divorce has taken place; and, therefore, if a husband should put
   away an adulteress, both would be laid under the necessity of remaining
   unmarried. As if this liberty of divorce meant only not to lie with his
   wife; and as if Christ did not evidently grant permission in this case
   to do what the Jews were wont indiscriminately to do at their pleasure.
   It was therefore a gross error; for, though Christ condemns as an
   adulterer the man who shall marry a wife that has been divorced, this
   is undoubtedly restricted to unlawful and frivolous divorces. In like
   manner, Paul enjoins those who have been so dismissed

   to remain unmarried, or to be reconciled to their husbands,
   (1 Corinthians 7:11;)

   that is, because quarrels and differences do not dissolve a marriage.
   This is clearly made out from the passage in Mark, where express
   mention is made of the wife who has left her husband: and if the wife
   shall divorce her husband Not that wives were permitted to give their
   husbands a letter of divorcement, unless so far as the Jews had been
   contaminated by foreign customs; but Mark intended to show that our
   Lord condemned the corruption which was at that time universal, that,
   after voluntary divorces, they entered on both sides into new
   marriages; and therefore he makes no mention of adultery.

   Matthew 19:10-12

   Matthew 19:10-12

   10. His disciples say to him, If such be the case of the man with his
   wife, [600] it is not expedient to enter into marriage. 11. Who said to
   them, [601] All are not capable of receiving this saying, but those to
   whom it is given. 12. For there are eunuchs, who were so born from
   their mother's womb; and there are eunuchs, who have been made eunuchs
   by men; and there are eunuchs, who have castrated themselves for the
   sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who can receive it, [602] let him
   receive it.


   10. His disciples say to him. As if it were a hard condition for
   husbands to be so bound to their wives, that, so long as they remain
   chaste, they are compelled to endure every thing rather than leave
   them, the disciples, roused by this answer of Christ, reply, that it is
   better to want wives than to submit to a knot of this kind. [603] But
   why do they not, on the other hand, consider how hard is the bondage of
   wives, [604] but because, devoted to themselves and their own
   convenience, they are driven by the feeling of the flesh to disregard
   others, and to think only of what is advantageous for themselves?
   Meanwhile, it is a display of base ingratitude that, from the dread or
   dislike of a single inconvenience, they reject a wonderful gift of God.
   It is better, according to them, to avoid marriage than to bind one's
   self by the bond of living always together. [605] But if God has
   ordained marriage for the general advantage of mankind, though it may
   be attended by some things that are disagreeable, it is not on that
   account to be despised. Let us therefore learn not to be delicate and
   saucy, but to use with reverence the gifts of God, even if there be
   something in them that does not please us. Above all, let us guard
   against this wickedness in reference to holy marriage; for, in
   consequence of its being attended by many annoyances, Satan has always
   endeavored to make it an object of hatred and detestation, in order to
   withdraw men from it. And Jerome has given too manifest a proof of a
   malicious and wicked disposition, in not only loading with calumnies
   that sacred and divinely appointed condition of life, but in collecting
   as many terms of reproach (loidorias) as he could from profane authors,
   in order to take away its respectability. But let us recollect that
   whatever annoyances belong to marriage are accidental, for they arise
   out of the depravity of man. Let us remember that, since our nature was
   corrupted, marriage began to be a medicine, and therefore we need not
   wonder if it have a bitter taste mixed with its sweetness. But we must
   see how our Lord confutes this folly.

   11. All are not capable of receiving this saying. By this he means,
   that the choice is not placed in our hands, as if we were to deliberate
   on a matter submitted to us. If any man thinks it advantageous for him
   to want a wife, and, without making any inquiry, lays upon himself an
   obligation to celibacy, [606] he is widely mistaken. God, who has
   declared it to be good that a man should have a woman to be his helper,
   will punish the contempt of his own appointment; for mortals take too
   much on themselves, when they endeavor to exempt themselves from the
   heavenly calling. But Christ proves that it is not free to all to make
   what choice they please, because the gift of continence is a special
   gift; for when he says that all are not capable of receiving it, but
   those to whom it is given, he plainly shows that it was not given to
   all. And this reproves the pride of those who do not hesitate to claim
   for themselves what Christ so manifestly refuses to them.

   12. For there are eunuchs Christ distinguishes three kinds of eunuchs
   Those who are so by nature, or who have been castrated by men, are
   debarred from marriage by this defect, for they are not men. He says
   that there are other eunuchs, who have castrated themselves, that they
   may be more at liberty to serve God; and these he exempts from the
   obligation to marry. Hence it follows, that all others who avoid
   marriage fight against God with sacrilegious hardihood, after the
   manner of the giants. When Papists urge the word castrate,
   (eunouchisan) as if at their own pleasure men might lay themselves
   under obligation to continence, it is too frivolous. For Christ has
   already declared, that God gives it to whom he chooses; and, a little
   afterwards, we shall find him maintaining, that it is folly in any man
   to choose to live unmarried, when he has not received this special
   gift. This castration, therefore, is not left to free will; but the
   plain meaning is, while some men are by nature fit to marry, though
   they abstain, they do not tempt God, because God grants them exemption.
   [607]

   For the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Many foolishly explain this as
   meaning, in order to deserve eternal life; as if celibacy contained
   within itself some meritorious service, as the Papists imagine that it
   is an angelical state. But Christ meant nothing more than that persons
   unmarried ought to have this for their object, that, being freed from
   all cares, they may apply themselves more readily to the duties of
   piety. It is, therefore, a foolish imagination, that celibacy is a
   virtue; for it is not in itself more pleasing to God than fasting, and
   is not entitled to be reckoned among the duties which he requires from
   us, but ought to have a reference to another object. Nay more, Christ
   expressly intended to declare that, though a man be pure from
   fornication, yet his celibacy is not approved by God, if he only
   consults his own ease and comfort, but that he is excused on this
   single ground, that he aims at a free and unrestrained meditation on
   the heavenly life. In short, Christ teaches us, that it is not enough,
   if unmarried men live chastely, unless they abstain from having wives,
   for the express purpose of devoting themselves to better employments.
   [608]

   He that can receive it, let him receive it. By this conclusion Christ
   warns them, that the use of marriage is not to be despised, unless we
   intend, with blind rashness, to rush headlong to destruction: for it
   became necessary to restrain the disciples, whom he saw acting
   inconsiderately and without judgment. But the warning is useful to all;
   for, in selecting a manner of life, few consider what has been given to
   them, but men rush forward, without discrimination, in whatever
   direction inconsiderate zeal prompts them. And I wish that the warning
   had been attended to in past times; but men's ears are stopped by I
   know not what enchantments of Satan, so that, contrary to nature, and,
   at it were, in spite of God, those whom God called to marriage have
   bound themselves by the cord of perpetual virginity [609] Next came the
   deadly cord of a vow, by which wretched souls were bound, [610] so that
   they never rose out of the ditch.

   13. Then were presented to him children, that he might lay hands on
   them and pray; but the disciples rebuked them. 14. And Jesus said to
   them, Suffer children, and forbid them not, to come to me; for of such
   is the kingdom of heaven. 15. And when he had laid hands on them, he
   departed thence.

   13. And they brought to him children, that he might touch them; but the
   disciples rebuked those who presented them. 14. And when Jesus saw it,
   he was displeased, and said to them, Suffer children to come to me, and
   do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of heaven. 15. Verily I
   say to you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a child
   shall not enter into it. 16. And when he had taken them in his arms, he
   laid hands on them, and blessed them.


   15. And they presented to him also infants, that he might touch them;
   which, when the disciples saw, they rebuked them. 16. But Jesus, when
   he had called them to him, said, Suffer children to come to me, and do
   not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God. 17. Verily I say to
   you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a child shall
   not enter into it.



   This narrative is highly useful; for it shows that Christ receives not
   only those who, moved by holy desire and faith, freely approach to him,
   but those who are not yet of age to know how much they need his grace.
   Those little children have not yet any understanding to desire his
   blessing; but when they are presented to him, he gently and kindly
   receives them, and dedicates them to the Father [611] by a solemn act
   of blessing. We must observe the intention of those who present the
   children; for if there had not been a deep-rooted conviction in their
   minds, that the power of the Spirit was at his disposal, that he might
   pour it out on the people of God, it would have been unreasonable to
   present their children. There is no room, therefore, to doubt, that
   they ask for them a participation of his grace; and so, by way of
   amplification, Luke adds the particle also; as if he had said that,
   after they had experienced the various ways in which he assisted
   adults, they formed an expectation likewise in regard to children,
   that, if he laid hands on them, they would not leave him without having
   received some of the gifts of the Spirit. The laying on of hands (as we
   have said on a former occasion) was an ancient and well known sign of
   blessing; and so there is no reason to wonder, if they desire that
   Christ, while employing that solemn ceremony, should pray for the
   children At the same time, as the inferior are blessed by the better,
   (Hebrews 7:7,) they ascribe to him the power and honor of the highest
   Prophet.

   Matthew 19:13. But the disciples rebuked them. If a crown [612] had
   been put on his head, they would have admitted it willingly, and with
   approbation; for they did not yet comprehend his actual office. But
   they reckon it unworthy of his character to receive children; and their
   error wanted not plausibility; for what has the highest Prophet and the
   Son of God to do with infants? But hence we learn, that they who judge
   of Christ according to the feeling of their flesh are unfair judges;
   for they constantly deprive him of his peculiar excellencies, and, on
   the other hand, ascribe, under the appearance of honor, what does not
   at all belong to him. Hence arose an immense mass of superstitions,
   which presented to the world a fancied Christ. [613] And therefore let
   us learn not to think of him otherwise than what himself teaches, and
   not to assign to him a character different from what he has received
   from the Father. We see what happened with Popery. They thought that
   they were conferring a great honor on Christ, if they bowed down before
   a small piece of bread; but in the sight of God it was an offensive
   abomination. Again, because they did not think it sufficiently
   honorable to him to perform the office of an Advocate for us, they made
   for themselves innumerable intercessors; but in this way they deprived
   him of the honor of Mediator.

   14. Suffer children. He declares that he wishes to receive children;
   and at length, taking them in his arms, he not only embraces, but
   blesses them by the laying on of hand; from which we infer that his
   grace is extended even to those who are of that age. And no wonder; for
   since the whole race of Adam is shut up under the sentence of death,
   all from the least even to the greatest must perish, except those who
   are rescued by the only Redeemer. To exclude from the grace of
   redemption those who are of that age would be too cruel; and therefore
   it is not without reason that we employ this passage as a shield
   against the Anabaptists. They refuse baptism to infants, because
   infants are incapable of understanding that mystery which is denoted by
   it. We, on the other hand, maintain that, since baptism is the pledge
   and figure of the forgiveness of sins, and likewise of adoption by God,
   it ought not to be denied to infants, whom God adopts and washes with
   the blood of his Son. Their objection, that repentance and newness of
   life are also denoted by it, is easily answered. Infants are renewed by
   the Spirit of God, according to the capacity of their age, till that
   power which was concealed within them grows by degrees, and becomes
   fully manifest at the proper time. Again, when they argue that there is
   no other way in which we are reconciled to God, and become heirs of
   adoption, than by faith, we admit this as to adults, but, with respect
   to infants, this passage demonstrates it to be false. Certainly, the
   laying on of hands was not a trifling or empty sign, and the prayers of
   Christ were not idly wasted in air. But he could not present the
   infants solemnly to God without giving them purity. And for what did he
   pray for them, but that they might be received into the number of the
   children of God? Hence it follows, that they were renewed by the Spirit
   to the hope of salvation. In short, by embracing them, he testified
   that they were reckoned by Christ among his flock. And if they were
   partakers of the spiritual gifts, which are represented by Baptism, it
   is unreasonable that they should be deprived of the outward sign. But
   it is presumption and sacrilege to drive far from the fold of Christ
   those whom he cherishes in his bosom, and to shut the door, and exclude
   as strangers those whom he does not wish to be forbidden to come to him

   For of such is the kingdom of heaven. Under this term he includes both
   little children and those who resemble them; for the Anabaptists
   foolishly exclude children, with whom the subject must have commenced;
   but at the same time, taking occasion from the present occurrence, he
   intended to exhort his disciples to lay aside malice and pride, and put
   on the nature of children Accordingly, it is added by Mark and Luke,
   that no man can enter into the kingdom of heaven unless he be made to
   resemble a child. But we must attend to Paul's admonition,

   not to be children in understanding, but in malice,
   (1 Corinthians 14:20.)

   callest thou me good? There is none good but God alone? [614] but if

   Honor thy father and mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as

   wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou
   shalt have a treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. 22. And when the
   young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful; for he had many

   17. And as he was going out into the road, one ran, and, when he had
   kneeled down, asked him, Good Master, what shall I do, that I may

   bear false witness, Defraud not, Honor thy father and mother. 20. But
   he answering said to him, Master, all these things have I kept from my

   art in want of one thing, go sell what thou hast, and give to the poor,

   do, that I may obtain eternal life? 19. And Jesus said to him, Why
   callest thou me good? None is good but God alone. 20. Thou knowest the
   commandments, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou
   shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness. Honor thy father
   and thy mother. 21. And he said, All these things have I kept from my
   youth. 22. Having heard this, Jesus said to him, Yet one thing thou
   wantest; sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt
   have a treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. 23. Having heard these
   things, he was grieved; for he was very rich.



   Matthew 19:16. And, lo, one. Luke says that he was a ruler, (archon,)
   that is, a man of very high authority, not one of the common people.
   [616] And though riches procure respect, [617] yet he appears to be
   here represented to have been held in high estimation as a good man.
   For my own part, after weighing all the circumstances, I have no doubt
   that, though he is called a young man, he belonged to the class of
   those who upheld the integrity of the Elders, by a sober and regular
   life. [618] He did not come treacherously, as the scribes were wont to
   do, but from a desire of instruction; and, accordingly, both by words
   and by kneeling, he testifies his reverence for Christ as a faithful
   teacher. But, on the other hand, a blind confidence in his works
   hindered him from profiting under Christ, to whom, in other respects,
   he wished to be submissive. Thus, in our own day, we find some who are
   not ill-disposed, but who, under the influence of I know not what
   shadowy holiness, [619] hardly relish the doctrine of the Gospel.

   But, in order to form a more correct judgment of the meaning of the
   answer, we must attend to the form of the question. He does not simply
   ask how and by what means he shall reach life, but what good thing he
   shall do, in order to obtain it. He therefore dreams of merits, on
   account of which he may receive eternal life as a reward due; and
   therefore Christ appropriately sends him to the keeping of the law,
   which unquestionably is the way of life, as I shall explain more fully
   afterwards.

   17. Why callest thou me good? I do not understand this correction in so
   refined a sense as is given by a good part of interpreters, as if
   Christ intended to suggest his Divinity; for they imagine that these
   words mean, "If thou perceivest in me nothing more exalted than human
   nature, thou falsely appliest to me the epithet good, which belongs to
   God alone." I do acknowledge that, strictly speaking, men and even
   angels do not deserve so honorable a title; because they have not a
   drop of goodness in themselves, but borrowed from God; and because in
   the former, goodness is only begun, and is not perfect. But Christ had
   no other intention than to maintain the truth of his doctrine; as if he
   had said, "Thou falsely callest me a good Master, unless thou
   acknowledgest that I have come from God." The essence of his Godhead,
   therefore, is not here maintained, but the young man is directed to
   admit the truth of the doctrine. He had already felt some disposition
   to obey; but Christ wishes him to rise higher, that he may hear God
   speaking. For -- as it is customary with men to make angels of those
   who are devils -- they indiscriminately give the appellation of good
   teachers to those in whom they perceive nothing divine; but those modes
   of speaking are only profanations of the gifts of God. We need not
   wonder, therefore, if Christ, in order to maintain the authority of his
   doctrine, directs the young man to God.

   Keep the commandments. This passage was erroneously interpreted by some
   of the ancients, whom the Papists have followed, as if Christ taught
   that, by beeping the law, we may merit eternal life On the contrary,
   Christ did not take into consideration what men can do, but replied to
   the question, What is the righteousness of works? or, What does the Law
   require? And certainly we ought to believe that God comprehended in his
   law the way of living holily and righteously, in which righteousness is
   included; for not without reason did Moses make this statement,

   He that does these things shall live in them, (Leviticus 18:5;)

   and again,

   I call heaven and earth to witness that l have
   this day showed you life, (Deuteronomy 30:19.)

   We have no right, therefore, to deny that the keeping of the law is
   righteousness, by which any man who kept the law perfectly -- if there
   were such a man -- would obtain life for himself. But as we are all
   destitute of the glory of God, (Romans 3:23,) nothing but cursing will
   be found in the law; and nothing remains for us but to betake ourselves
   to the undeserved gift of righteousness. And therefore Paul lays down a
   twofold righteousness, the righteousness of the law, (Romans 10:5,) and
   the righteousness of faith, (Romans 10:6.) He makes the first to
   consist in works, and the second, in the free grace of Christ.

   Hence we infer, that this reply of Christ is legal, because it was
   proper that the young man who inquired about the righteousness of works
   should first be taught that no man is accounted righteous before God
   unless he has fulfilled the law, [620] (which is impossible,) that,
   convinced of his weakness, he might betake himself to the assistance of
   faith. I acknowledge, therefore, that, as God has promised the reward
   of eternal life to those who keep his law, we ought to hold by this
   way, if the weakness of our flesh did not prevent; but Scripture
   teaches us, that it is through our own fault that it becomes necessary
   for us to receive as a gift what we cannot obtain by works. If it be
   objected, that it is in vain to hold out to us the righteousness which
   is in the law, (Romans 10:5,) which no man will ever be able to reach,
   I reply, since it is the first part of instruction, by which we are led
   to the righteousness which is obtained by prayer, it is far from being
   superfluous; and, therefore, when Paul says, that the doers of the law
   are justified, (Romans 2:13,) he excludes all from the righteousness of
   the law.

   This passage sets aside all the inventions which the Papists have
   contrived in order to obtain salvation. For not only are they mistaken
   in wishing to lay God under obligation to them by their good works, to
   bestow salvation as a debt; but when they apply themselves to do what
   is right, they leave out of view the doctrine of the law, and attend
   chiefly to their pretended devotions, as they call them, not that they
   openly reject the law of God, but that they greatly prefer human
   traditions. [621] But what does Christ say? That the only worship of
   which God approves is that which he has prescribed; because obedience
   is better to him than all sacrifices, [622] (1 Samuel 15:22.) So then,
   while the Papists are employed in frivolous traditions, let every man
   who endeavors to regulate his life by obedience to Christ direct his
   whole attention to keep the commandments of the law.

   18. Thou shalt not murder It is surprising that, though Christ intended
   to show that we are bound to obey the whole law, he should mention the
   second table only; but he did so, because from the duties of charity
   the disposition of every man is better ascertained. Piety towards God
   holds, no doubt, a higher rank; [623] but as the observation of the
   first table is often feigned by hypocrites, the second table is better
   adapted for making a scrutiny. [624] Let us know, therefore, that
   Christ selected those commandments in which is contained a proof of
   true righteousness; but by a synecdoche he takes a part for the whole.
   As to the circumstance of his placing that commandment last which
   speaks of honoring parents, it is of no consequence, for he paid no
   attention to the regular order. Yet it is worthy of notice, that this
   commandment is declared to belong to the second table, that no one may
   be led astray by the error of Josephus, who thought that it belonged to
   the first table. [625] What is added at the end, Thou shalt love thy
   neighbor, contains nothing different from the former commandments, but
   is, general explanation of them all.

   The young man saith to him. The law must have been dead to him, when he
   vainly imagined that he was so righteous; for if he had not flattered
   himself through hypocrisy, it was an excellent advice to him to learn
   humility, to contemplate his spots and blemishes in the mirror of the
   law. But, intoxicated with foolish confidence, he fearlessly boasts
   that he has discharged his duty properly from his childhood. Paul
   acknowledges that the same thing happened to himself, that, so long as
   the power of the law was unknown to him, he believed that he was alive;
   but that, after he knew what the law could do, a deadly wound was
   inflicted on him, (Romans 7:9.) So the reply of Christ, which follows,
   was suited to the man's disposition. And yet Christ does not demand any
   thing beyond the commandments of the law, but, as the bare recital had
   not affected him, Christ employed other words for detecting the hidden
   disease of avarice.

   I confess that we are nowhere commanded in the law to sell all; but as
   the design of the law is, to bring men to self-denial, and as it
   expressly condemns covetousness, we see that Christ had no other object
   in view than to correct the false conviction of the young man. [626]
   for if he had known himself thoroughly, as soon as he heard the mention
   of the law, he would have acknowledged that he was liable to the
   judgment of God; but now, when the bare words of the law do not
   sufficiently convince him of his guilt, the inward meaning is expressed
   by other words. If Christ now demanded any thing beyond the
   commandments of the law, he would be at variance with himself. He just
   now taught that perfect righteousness is comprehended in the
   commandments of the law: how then will it agree with this to charge the
   law with deficiency? Besides, the protestation of Moses, (Deuteronomy
   30:15,) which I formerly quoted, would be false.

   Mark 10:21. One thing thou wantest. Christ therefore does not mean that
   the young man wanted one Thing beyond the keeping of the law, but in
   the very keeping of the law. For though the law nowhere obliges us to
   sell all, yet as it represses all sinful desires, and teaches us to
   bear the cross, as it bids us be prepared for hunger and poverty, the
   young man is very far from keeping it fully, so long as he is attached
   to his riches, and burns with covetousness. And he says that one thing
   is wanting, because he does not need to preach to him about fornication
   and murder, but to point out a particular disease, as if he were laying
   his finger on the sore.

   It ought also to be observed, that he does not only enjoin him to sell,
   but likewise to give to the poor; for to part with riches would not be
   in itself a virtue, but rather a vain ambition. Profane historians
   applaud Crates, a Theban, because he threw into the sea his money and
   all that he reckoned valuable; for he did not think that he could save
   himself unless his wealth were lost; as if it would not have been
   better to bestow on others what he imagined to be more than he needed.
   Certainly, as charity is the bond of perfection, (Colossians 3:14,) he
   who deprives others, along with himself, of the use of money, deserves
   no praise; and therefore Christ applauds not simply the selling but
   liberality in assisting the poor

   The mortification of the flesh is still more strongly urged by Christ,
   when he says, Follow me. For he enjoins him not only to become his
   disciple, but to submit his shoulders to bear the cross, as Mark
   expressly states. And it was necessary that such an excitement should
   be applied; for, having been accustomed to the ease, and leisure and
   conveniences, of home, he had never experienced, in the smallest
   degree, what it was to crucify the old man, and to subdue the desires
   of the flesh. But it is excessively ridiculous in the monks, under the
   pretense of this passage, to claim for themselves state of perfection.
   First, it is easy to infer, that Christ does not command all without
   exception to sell all that they have; for the husbandman, who had been
   accustomed to live by his labor, and to support his children, would do
   wrong in selling his possession, if he were not constrained to it by
   any necessity. To keep what God has put in our power, provided that, by
   maintaining ourselves and our family in sober and frugal manner, we
   bestow some portion on the poor, is a greater virtue than to squander
   all. But what sort of thing is that famous selling, on which the monks
   plume themselves? A good part of them, finding no provision at home,
   plunge themselves into monasteries as well-stocked hog-styes. All take
   such good care of themselves, that they feed in idleness on the bread
   of others. A rare exchange truly, when those who are ordered to give to
   the poor what they justly possess are not satisfied with their own, but
   seize on the property of others.

   Jesus beholding him, loved him. The inference which the Papists draw
   from this, that works morally good -- that is, works which are not
   performed by the impulse of the Spirit, but go before regeneration --
   have the merit of congruity, is an excessively childish contrivance.
   For if merit be alleged to be the consequence of the love of God, we
   must then say that frogs and fleas have merit, because all the
   creatures of God, without exception, are the objects of his love. To
   distinguish the degrees of love is, therefore, a matter of importance.
   [627] As to the present passage, it may be enough to state briefly,
   that God embraces in fatherly love none but his children, whom he has
   regenerated with the Spirit of adoption, and that it is in consequence
   of this love that they are accepted at his tribunal. In this sense, to
   be loved by God, and to be justified in his sight, are synonymous
   terms. [628]

   But God is sometimes said to love those whom he does not approve or
   justify; for, since the preservation of the human race is agreeable to
   Him -- which consists in justice, uprightness, moderation, prudence,
   fidelity, and temperance -- he is said to love the political virtues;
   not that they are meritorious of salvation or of grace, but that they
   have reference to an end of which he approves. In this sense, under
   various points of view, God loved Aristides and Fabricius, and also
   hated them; for, in so far as he had bestowed on them outward
   righteousness, and that for the general advantage, he loved his own
   work in them; but as their heart was impure, the outward semblance of
   righteousness was of no avail for obtaining righteousness. For we know
   that by faith alone hearts are purified, and that the Spirit of
   uprightness is given to the members of Christ alone. Thus the question
   is answered, How was it possible that Christ should love a man who was
   proud and a hypocrite, while nothing is more hateful to God than these
   two vices? For it is not inconsistent, that the good seed, which God
   has implanted in some natures, shall be loved by Him, and yet that He
   should reject their persons and works on account of corruption.

   Matthew 19:22. He went away sorrowful. The result at length showed how
   widely distant the young man was from that perfection to which Christ
   had called him; for how comes it that he withdraws from the school of
   Christ, but because he finds it uneasy to be stripped of his riches?
   But if we are not prepared to endure poverty, it is manifest that
   covetousness reigns in us. And this is what I said at the outset, that
   the order which Christ gave, to sell all that he had, was not an
   addition to the law, but the scrutiny of a concealed vice. [629] For
   the more deeply a man is tainted by this or the other vice, the more
   strikingly will it be dragged forth to light by being reproved. We are
   reminded also by this example that, if we would persevere steadily in
   the school of Christ, we must renounce the flesh. This young man, who
   had brought both a desire to learn and modesty, withdrew from Christ,
   because it was hard to part with a darling vice. The same thing will
   happen to us, unless the sweetness of the grace of Christ render all
   the allurements of the flesh distasteful to us. Whether or not this
   temptation was temporary, so that the young man afterwards repented, we
   know not; but it may be conjectured with probability, that his
   covetousness kept him back from making any proficiency.

   23. And Jesus said to his disciples, Verily I say to you, A rich man
   will with difficulty enter into the kingdom of heaven. 24. Again I say
   to you, It is easier for a camel [630] to pass through the eye of a
   needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 25. And
   his disciples, when they had heard these things, were greatly amazed,
   [631] saying, Who then can be saved? 26. And Jesus, beholding them,
   said to them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are
   possible.


   23. And when Jesus had looked around, he said to his disciples, With
   what difficulty shall they who have riches enter into the kingdom of
   God! 24. And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus
   again replying, said to them, Children, how difficult is it for those
   who have confidence in riches to enter into the kingdom of God! 25. It
   is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a
   rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 26. And they wondered beyond
   measure, saying within themselves, And who can be saved? 27. And Jesus
   beholding them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for
   all things are possible with God.

   24. And Jesus, perceiving that he was sorrowful, said, With what
   difficulty shall they who have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
   25. For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle,
   than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 26. And they that
   heard it said, And who can be saved? [632] 27. But he said, The things
   which are impossible with men are possible with God.



   Matthew 19:23. A rich man will with difficulty enter. Christ warns
   them, not only how dangerous and how deadly a plague avarice is, but
   also how great an obstacle is presented by riches. In Mark, indeed, he
   mitigates the harshness of his expression, by restricting it to those
   only who place confidence in riches But these words are, I think,
   intended to confirm, rather than correct, the former statement, as if
   he had affirmed that they ought not to think it strange, that he made
   the entrance into the kingdom of heaven so difficult for the rich,
   because it is an evil almost common to all to trust in their riches Yet
   this doctrine is highly useful to all; to the rich, that, being warned
   of their danger, they may be on their guard; to the poor, that,
   satisfied with their lot, they may not so eagerly desire what would
   bring more damage than gain. It is true indeed, that riches do not, in
   their own nature, hinder us from following God; but, in consequence of
   the depravity of the human mind, it is scarcely possible for those who
   have a great abundance to avoid being intoxicated by them. So they who
   are exceedingly rich are held by Satan bound, as it were, in chains,
   that they may not raise their thoughts to heaven; nay more, they bury
   and entangle themselves, and became utter slaves to the earth. The
   comparison of the camel., which is soon after added, is intended to
   amplify the difficulty; for it means that the rich are so swelled with
   pride and presumption, that they cannot endure to be reduced to the
   straits through which God makes his people to pass. The word camel
   denotes, I think, a rope used by sailors, rather than the animal so
   named. [633]

   25. And his disciples, when they heard these things, were greatly
   amazed. The disciples are astonished, because it ought to awaken in us
   no little anxiety, that riches obstruct the entrance into the kingdom
   of God; for, wherever we turn our eyes, a thousand obstacles will
   present themselves. But let us observe that, while they were struck
   with astonishment, they did not shrink from the doctrines of Christ.
   The case was different with him who was lately mentioned; for he was so
   much alarmed by the severity of the commandment, that he separated from
   Christ; while they, though trembling, and inquiring, who can be saved?
   do not break off in an opposite direction, but are desirous to conquer
   despair. Thus it will be of service to us to tremble at the
   threatenings of God: whenever he denounces any thing that is gloomy or
   dreadful, provided that our minds are not discouraged, but rather
   aroused.

   26. With men this is impossible. Christ does not entirely free the
   minds of his disciples from all anxiety; for it is proper that they
   should perceive how difficult it is to ascend to heaven; first, that
   they may direct all their efforts to this object; and next, that,
   distrusting themselves, they may implore strength from heaven. We see
   how great is our indolence and carelessness; and what the consequence
   would be if believers thought that they had to walk at ease, for
   pastime, along a smooth and cheerful plain. Such is the reason why
   Christ does not extenuate the danger -- though he perceives the terror
   which it excited in his disciples -- but rather increases it; for
   though formerly he said only that it was difficult, he now affirms it
   to be impossible Hence it is evident, that those teachers are guilty of
   gross impropriety, who are so much afraid to speak harshly, that they
   give indulgence to the slothfulness of the flesh. They ought to follow,
   on the contrary, the rule of Christ, who so regulates his style that,
   after men have been bowed down within themselves, he teaches them to
   rely on the grace of God alone, and, at the same time, excites them to
   prayer. In this manner, the weakness of men is seasonably relieved, not
   by ascribing anything to them, but by arousing their minds to expect
   the grace of God. By this reply of Christ is also refuted that widely
   embraced principle -- which the Papists have borrowed from Jerome --
   "Whoever shall say that it is impossible to keep the law, let him be
   accursed. "For Christ plainly declares, that it is not possible for men
   to keep the way of salvation, except so far as the grace of God assists
   them.

   differ only by a single vowel; kamelos, denoting a camel, and kamilos a
   cable or rope It does not appear that Calvin; relied on certain

   kamelon. But he adopted the notion equally unfounded, that Greek
   writers sometimes used kamelos, in the sense of kamilos. Had due

   showed a strong leaning to the idea of cable, which our Author favors,
   but have now very generally abandoned it, and returned to the true
   reading. -- Ed

   31. But many that are first shall be last, and the last first. [636]


   28. And Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.
   29. Who said to them, Verily I say to you, There is no man who hath
   left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, on account
   of the kingdom of God, 30. Who shall not receive much more at this
   time, and in the world to come eternal life.

   Luke 22:28-30

   28. You are they that have continued with me in my temptations: [637]
   29. And I appoint to you the kingdom, [638] as my Father hath appointed
   it to me; 30. That you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and
   may sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.



   Matthew 19:27. Then Peter answering said to him. Peter tacitly compares
   himself and the other disciples to the rich man, whom the world had
   turned aside from Christ. As they had led a poor and wandering [639]
   life, which was not unaccompanied by disgrace and by annoyances, and as
   no better condition for the future presented itself, he properly
   inquires if it be to no purpose that they have left all their property,
   and devoted themselves to Christ; for it would be unreasonable if,
   after having been stripped of their property by the Lord, they should
   not be restored to a better condition.

   Lo, we have left all. But what were those all things? for, being mean
   and very poor men, they scarcely had a home to leave, and therefore
   this boasting might appear to be ridiculous. And certainly experience
   shows how large an estimate men commonly form of their duties towards
   God, as at this day, among the Papists, those who were little else than
   beggars make it a subject of haughty reproach that they have sustained
   great damage for the sake of the Gospel. But the disciples may be
   excused on this ground, that, though their wealth was not magnificent,
   they subsisted at home, by their manual labors, not less cheerfully
   than the richest man. And we know that men of humble condition, who
   have been accustomed to a quiet and modest life, reckon it a greater
   hardship to be torn from their wives and children than those who are
   led by ambition, or who are carried in various directions by the gale
   of prosperity. Certainly, if some reward had not been reserved for the
   disciples, it would have been foolish in them to have changed their
   course of life. [640] But though on that ground they might be excused,
   they err in this respect, that they demand a triumph to be given them,
   before they have finished their warfare. If we ever experience such
   uneasiness at delay, and if we are tempted by impatience, let us learn
   first to reflect on the comforts by which the Lord soothes the
   bitterness of the cup in this world, and next elevate our minds to the
   hope of the heavenly life; for these two points embrace the answer of
   Christ.

   28. Verily I say to you. That the disciples may not think that they
   have lost their pains, and repent of having begun the course, Christ
   warns them that the glory of his kingdom, which at that time was still
   hidden, was about to be revealed. As if he had said, "There is no
   reason why that mean condition should discourage you; for I, who am
   scarcely equal to the lowest, will at length ascend to my throne of
   majesty. Endure then for a little, till the time arrive for revealing
   nay glory." And what does he then promise to them? That they shall be
   partakers of the same glory.

   You also shall sit on twelve thrones By assigning to them thrones, from
   which they may judge the twelve tribes of Israel, he compares them to
   assessors, or first councilors and judges, who occupy the highest seats
   in the royal council. We know that the number of those who were chosen
   to be apostles was twelve, in order to testify that, by the agency of
   Christ, God purposed to collect the remnant of his people which was
   scattered. This was a very high rank, but hitherto was concealed; and
   therefore Christ holds their wishes in suspense till the latest
   revelation of his kingdom, when they will fully receive the fruit of
   their election. And though the kingdom of Christ is, in some respects,
   manifested by the preaching of the Gospel, there is no doubt that
   Christ here speaks of the last day.

   In the regeneration. Some connect this term with the following clause.
   In this sense, regeneration would be nothing else than the renovation
   which shall follow our restoration, when life shall swallow up what is
   mortal, and when our mean body shall be transformed into the heavenly
   glory of Christ. But I rather explain regeneration as referring to the
   first coming of Christ; for then the world began to be renewed, and
   arose out of the darkness of death into the light of life. And this way
   of speaking occurs frequently in the Prophets, and is exceedingly
   adapted to the connection of this passage. For the renovation of the
   Church, which had been so frequently promised, had raised an
   expectation of wonderful happiness, as soon as the Messiah should
   appear; and therefore, in order to guard against that error, Christ
   distinguishes between the beginning and the completion of his reign.

   Luke 22:28. You are they who have continued with me. Although Luke
   appears to relate a different discourse of Christ, and one which was
   delivered at a different time, yet I have no doubt that it refers to
   the same time. For it is not a continued discourse of Christ that is
   here related, but detached sentences, without any regard to the order
   of time, as we shall shortly afterwards have occasion to state. But he
   employs more words than Matthew; for he declares that, as the apostles
   had accompanied him, and had remained steadfastly in his temptations,
   they would also be partakers of his glory. It is asked, in what sense
   does he call them his temptations? I think that he means the contests
   by which God tried him and the apostles in common. And properly did he
   use the word temptations; for, according to the feeling of human
   nature, his faith and patience were actually tried.

   29. And I appoint to you the kingdom. Here he makes them not only
   judges, but kings; for he shares with them the kingdom which he
   received from the Father There is an emphasis in the word appoint, that
   they may not, by warmth and vehemence of desire, hasten too eagerly to
   possess the kingdom of which he alone has the lawful right to dispose.
   By his own example, also, he exhorts them to patience; for, though he
   was ordained by the Father to be a King, yet he was not immediately
   raised to his glory, but even emptied Himself, (Philippians 2:7,) and
   by the ignominy of the cross obtained kingly honor. To eat and drink at
   his table is put metaphorically for being made partakers of the same
   glory.

   Matthew 19:29. And whosoever shall forsake. After having raised the
   expectation of his followers to the hope of a future life, he supports
   them by immediate consolations, [641] and strengthens them for bearing
   the cross. For though God permit his people to be severely afflicted,
   he never abandons them, so as not to recompense their distresses by his
   assistance. And here he does not merely address the apostles, but takes
   occasion to direct his discourse generally to all the godly. The
   substance of it is this: Those who shall willingly lose all for the
   sake of Christ, will be more happy even in this life than if they had
   retained the full possession of them; but the chief reward is laid up
   for them in heaven.

   But what he promises about recompensing them a hundredfold appears not
   at all to agree with experience; for in the greater number of cases,
   those who have been deprived of their parents, or children, and other
   relatives -- who have been reduced to widowhood, and stripped of their
   wealth, for the testimony of Christ -- are so far from recovering their
   property, that in exile, solitude and desertion, they have a hard
   struggle with severe poverty. I reply, if any man estimate aright the
   immediate grace of God, by which he relieves the sorrows of his people,
   he will acknowledge that it is justly preferred to all the riches of
   the world. For though unbelievers flourish, (Psalm 92:7,) yet as they
   know not what awaits them on the morrow (James 4:14,) they must be
   always tossed about in perplexity and terror, and it is only by
   stupefying themselves in some sort that they can at all enjoy
   prosperity. [642] Yet God gladdens his people, so that the small
   portion of good which they enjoy is more highly valued by them, and far
   sweeter, than if out of Christ they had enjoyed an unlimited abundance
   of good things. In this sense I interpret the expression used by Mark,
   with persecutions; as if Christ had said, Though persecutions always
   await the godly in this world, and though the cross, as it were, is
   attached to their back, yet so sweet is the seasoning of the grace of
   God, which gladdens them, that their condition is more desirable than
   the luxuries of kings.

   30. And many that are first shall be last. This sentence was added in
   order to shake off the indolence of the flesh. The apostles, though
   they had scarcely begun the course, were hastening to demand the prize.
   And such is the disposition of almost all of us, that, when a month has
   elapsed, we ask, like soldiers who have served their time, to receive a
   discharge. But Christ exhorts those who have begun well (Galatians 3:3;
   5:7) to vigorous perseverance, and at the same time gives warning, that
   it will be of no avail to runners to have begun with alacrity, if they
   lose courage in the midst of the course. In like manner Paul also warns
   us, that not all who run obtain t/re prize, (1 Corinthians 9:24;) and
   in another passage he exhorts believers, by referring to his own
   example, to:

   forget those things which are behind, and press forward to the
   remaining portion of their course,
   (Philippians 3:13,14.)

   As often, therefore, as we call to mind the heavenly crown, we ought,
   as it were, to feel the application of fresh spurs, that we may not be
   more indolent for the future.

   Matthew 20:1-16

   Matthew 20:1-16

   1. For the kingdom of heaven is like a householder, who went out at
   break of day to hire laborers into his vineyard. 2. And having made an
   agreement with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them into his
   vineyard. 3. And having gone out about the third hour, he saw others
   standing idle in the market-place. 4. And he said to them, Go you also
   into the vineyard, and whatever shall be right I will give you. 5. And
   they went away. And again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour,
   and acted in the same manner. 6. And about the eleventh hour he went
   out, and found others standing idle, and said to them, Why stand you
   here all the day idle? 7. They say to him, Because nobody hath hired
   us. He saith to them, Go you also into the vineyard, and you will
   receive what shall be right. 8. And when the evening was come, the
   master of the vineyard saith to his steward, Call the laborers, and pay
   them their hire, beginning with the last even to the first. 9. And when
   they came who had come about the eleventh hour, they received every man
   a penny. 10. And they who had come first thought that they would
   receive more, and they also received every man a penny. 11. And when
   they had received it, they murmured against the householder,
   12. Saying, These last have been but one hour at work, and thou hast
   made them equal to us, who have endured the burden of the day and the
   heat. 13. But he answering one of them, said, Friend, I do thee no
   wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny? 14. Take what is
   thine, and go away: and I intend to give to this last as much as to
   thee. 15. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own
   property? Is thy eye evil, because I am good? 16. So the last shall be
   first, and the first shall be last: for many are called, but few are
   chosen.



   As this parable is nothing else than a confirmation of the preceding
   sentence, the last shall be first, it now remains to see in what manner
   it ought to be applied. Some commentators reduce it to this general
   proposition, that the glory of all; will be equal, because the heavenly
   inheritance is not obtained by the merits of works, but is bestowed
   freely. But Christ does not here argue either about the equality of the
   heavenly glory, or about the future condition of the godly. He only
   declares that those who were first in point of time have no right to
   boast or to insult others; because the Lord, whenever he pleases, may
   call those whom he appeared for a time to disregard, and may make them
   equal, or even superior, to the first. If any man should resolve to
   sift out with exactness every portion of this parable, his curiosity
   would be useless; and therefore we have nothing more to inquire than
   what was the design of Christ to teach. Now we have already said that
   he had no other object in view than to excite his people by continual
   spurs to make progress. We know that indolence almost always springs
   from excessive confidence; and this is the reason why many, as if they
   had reached the goal, stop short in the middle of the course. Thus Paul
   enjoins us to forget the things which are behind, (Philippians 3:13,)
   that, reflecting on what yet remains for us, we may arouse ourselves to
   persevere in running. But there will be no harm in examining the words,
   that the doctrine may be more clearly evinced.

   Matthew 20:1. For the kingdom of heaven is like a householder. The
   meaning is, that such is the nature of the divine calling, as if a man
   were, early in the morning, to hire laborers for the cultivation of his
   vineyard at a fixed price, and were afterwards to employ others without
   an agreement, but to give them an equal hire. He uses the phrase,
   kingdom of heaven, because he compares the spiritual life to the
   earthly life, and the reward of eternal life to money which men pay in
   return for work that has been done for them. There are some who give an
   ingenious interpretation to this passage, as if Christ were
   distinguishing between Jews and Gentiles. The Jews, they tell us, were
   called at the first hour, with an agreement as to the hire; for the
   Lord promised to them eternal life, on the condition that they should
   fulfill the law; while, in calling the Gentiles, no bargain was made at
   least as to works, for salvation was freely offered to them in Christ.
   But all subtleties of that sort are unseasonable; for the Lord makes no
   distinction in the bargain, but only in the time; because those who
   entered last, and in the evening, into the vineyard, receive the same
   hire with the first Though, in the Law, God formerly promised to the
   Jews the hire of works, (Leviticus 18:5,) yet we know that this was
   without effect, because no man ever obtained salvation by his merits.

   Why then, it will be said, does Christ expressly mention a bargain
   [643] in reference to the first, but make no mention of it in reference
   to the others? It was in order to show that, without doing injury to
   any one, as much honor is conferred on the last, as if they had been
   called at the beginning. For strictly speaking, he owes no man any
   thing, and from us, who are devoted to his service, he demands, as a
   matter of right, all the duties which are incumbent on us. But as he
   freely offers to us a reward, he is said to hire the labors which, on
   other grounds, were due to him. This is also the reason why he gives
   the name of a hire to the crown which he bestows freely. Again, in
   order to show that we have no right to complain of God, if he make us
   companions in honor with those who followed us after a long interval,
   he borrowed a comparison from the ordinary custom of men, who bargain
   about the hire, before they send laborers to their work.

   If any man infer from this, that men are created for the purpose of
   doing something, and that every man has his province assigned him by
   God, that they may not sit down in idleness, he will offer no violence
   to the words of Christ. [644] We are also at liberty to infer, that our
   whole life is unprofitable, and that we are justly accused of
   indolence, until each of us regulate his life by the command and
   calling of God. Hence it follows, that they labor to no purpose, who
   rashly undertake this or that course of life, and do not wait for the
   intimation of the call of God. Lastly, we learn from the words of
   Christ, that those only are pleasing to God, who labor for the
   advantage of their brethren.

   A penny (which was rather more than four times the value of a French
   carolus,) [645] was probably the ordinary hire for a day's work. The
   third, sixth, and ninth hour, are expressly mentioned, because, while
   the ancients were wont to divide the day into twelve hours, from
   sunrise to sunset, there was another division of the day into every
   three hours; as, again, the night was divided into four watches; and so
   the eleventh hour means the close of the day.

   8. And when the evening was come. It would be improper to look for a
   mystery in the injunction of the householder to begin with the last, as
   if God crowned those first who were last in the order of time; for such
   a notion would not at all agree with the doctrine of Paul. They that
   are alive, he says, at the coming of Christ will not come before those
   who previously fell asleep in Christ, but will follow, (1 Thessalonians
   4:15.) But Christ observes a different order in this passage, because
   he could not otherwise have expressed -- what he afterwards adds --
   that the first murmured, because they did not receive more [646]

   Besides, he did not intend to say that this murmuring will take place
   at the last day, but merely to affirm that there will be no occasion
   for murmuring The personification (prosopopoia) which he employs throws
   no small light on this doctrine, that men have no right to complain of
   the bounty of God, when he honors unworthy persons by large rewards
   beyond what they deserve. There is no foundation, therefore, for what
   some have imagined, that these words are directed against the Jews, who
   were full of malice and envy towards the Gentiles; for it would be
   absurd to say that such persons receive an equal hire with the children
   of God, and this malignity, which leads men to exclaim against God,
   does not apply to believers. But the plain meaning is, that, since God
   defrauds no man of a just hire, He is at liberty to bestow on those
   whom He has lately called an undeserved reward.

   16. So the first shall be last. He does not now compare the Jews to the
   Gentiles, (as in another passages) nor the reprobate, who swerve from
   the faith, to the elect who persevere; and therefore the sentence which
   is introduced by some interpreters, many are called, but few are
   chosen, does not apply to that point. Christ only meant to say that
   every one who has been called before others ought to run with so much
   the greater alacrity, and, next, to exhort all men to be modest, not to
   give themselves the preference above others, but willingly to share
   with them a common prize. As the apostles were the first-fruits of the
   whole church, they appeared to possess some superiority; and Christ did
   not deny that they would sit as judges to govern the twelve tribes of
   Israel. But that they might not be carried away by ambition or vain
   confidence in themselves, it was necessary also to remind them that
   others, who would long afterwards be called, would be partakers of the
   same glory, because God is not limited to any person, but calls freely
   whomsoever He pleases, and bestows on those who are called whatever
   rewards He thinks fit.

   Luke 18:31-34

   Matthew 20:17-19

   Mark 10:32-34

   Luke 18:31-34

   17. And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart
   in the way, and said to them, 18. Lo, we go up to Jerusalem; and the
   Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes; and they
   will condemn him to death. 19. And they will deliver him to the
   Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him; [647] and on the
   third day he will rise again.


   32. And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went
   before them: and they were amazed; and, while they followed him, where
   afraid. And having again taken aside the twelve, he began to tell them
   what things would happen to him: 33. Lo, we go up to Jerusalem; and the
   Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes; and they
   will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles:
   34. And will mock him, and scourge him, and spit upon him, and kill
   him; and on the third day he will rise again.

   31. And Jesus took the twelve, and said to them, Lo, we go up to
   Jerusalem, and all things which have been written by the prophets
   concerning the Son of man will be accomplished. 32. For he will be
   delivered to the Gentiles, and mocked, and insulted, and spat on;
   33. And after having scourged, they will kill him; and on the third day
   he will rise again. 34. And they understood none of these things; and
   this saying was hidden from them, and they understood not the things
   which were spoken. [648]



   Though the apostles had been previously informed what kind of death
   awaited our Lord, yet as they had not sufficiently profited by it, he
   now repeats anew what he had frequently said. He sees that the day of
   his death is at hand; nay more, he is already in a state of readiness
   to offer himself to be sacrificed; and, on the other hand, he sees the
   disciples not only afraid, but overwhelmed by blind alarm. He therefore
   exhorts them to steadiness, that they may not immediately yield to
   temptation. Now there are two methods by which he confirms them; for,
   by foretelling what would happen, he not only fortifies them, that they
   may not give way, when a calamity, which has arisen suddenly and
   contrary to expectation, takes them by surprise, but meets the offense
   of the cross by a proof of his Divinity, that they may not lose courage
   at beholding his short abasement, when they are convinced that he is
   the Son of God, and therefore will be victorious over death. The second
   method of confirmation is taken from his approaching resurrection.

   But it will be proper to look more closely at the words. Mark states --
   what is omitted by the other two Evangelists -- that, before our Lord
   explained to his disciples in private that he was going straight to the
   sacrifice of death, not only they, but also the rest of his followers,
   were sorrowful and trembling. Now why they were seized with this fear
   it is not easy to say, if it was not because they had already learned
   that they had dangerous adversaries at Jerusalem, and would therefore
   have wished that Christ should remain in some quiet retreat beyond the
   reach of the darts, rather than voluntarily expose himself to such
   inveterate enemies. Although this fear was in many respects improper,
   yet the circumstance of their following Christ is a proof of no
   ordinary respect and obedience. It would indeed have been far better to
   hasten cheerfully and without regret, wheresoever the Son of God chose
   to lead them; but commendation is due to their reverence for his
   person, which appears in choosing to do violence to their own feelings
   rather than to forsake him.

   Matthew 20:17. Took the twelve disciples apart in the way It may appear
   surprising that he makes the twelve alone acquainted with his secret,
   since all have need of consolation, for all had been alike seized with
   fear. I consider the reason why he did not publish his death to have
   been, that the report might not spread too widely before the time.
   Besides, as he did not expect that the warning would be of immediate
   advantage, he reckoned it enough to entrust it to a few, who were
   afterwards to be his witnesses. For, as the seed thrown into the earth
   does not immediately spring up, so we know that Christ said many things
   to the apostles which did not immediately yield fruit. And if he had
   admitted all indiscriminately to this discourse, it was possible that
   many persons, seized with alarm, might flee, and fill the ears of the
   public with this report; and thus the death of Christ would have lost
   its glory, because he would have appeared to have rashly brought it on
   himself. Secretly, therefore, he addresses the apostles, and does not
   even select them as qualified to receive profit by it, but, as I lately
   hinted, that they may afterwards be witnesses.

   On this subject Luke is more full than the others; for he relates not
   only that Christ predicted the events which were near at hand, but also
   that he added the doctrine, that those things which had been written by
   the prophets would be accomplished in the Son of man. It was an
   excellent remedy for overcoming temptation, to perceive in the very
   ignominy of the cross the marks by which the Prophets had pointed out
   the promised Author of salvation. There can be no doubt that our Lord
   pointed out also from the Prophets what kind of fruit they ought to
   expect from his death; for the Prophets do not only teach that Christ
   must suffer, but add the reason, that he may reconcile the world to
   God.

   18. Lo, we go up to Jerusalem. Hence we perceive that Christ was endued
   with divine fortitude for overcoming the terrors of death, for he
   knowingly and willingly hastens to undergo it. [649] For why does he,
   without any constraint, march forward to suffer a shocking murder, but
   because the invincible power of the Spirit enabled him to subdue fear,
   and raised him above all human feelings? By a minute detail of the
   circumstances, he gives a still more evident proof of his Divinity. For
   he could not -- as man -- have foreseen that, after having been
   condemned by the chief priests and scribes, he would be delivered up to
   the Gentiles, and spat on, and mocked in various ways, and scourged,
   and at length dragged to the punishment of the cross Yet it must be
   observed that, though our Lord was fully acquainted with the weakness
   of his disciples, he does not conceal from them a very grievous
   offense. For -- as we have said on a former occasion [650] -- nothing
   could at that time have happened more powerfully calculated to shake
   the minds of the godly, than to see the whole of the sacred order of
   the Church opposed to Christ.

   And yet he does not spare their weakness by deceiving them, but,
   candidly declaring the whole matter, points out the way to overcome
   temptation; namely, by looking forward with certainty to his
   resurrection. But as it was necessary that His death should go before,
   he makes their triumph, in the meantime, to consist in hope.

   Luke 18:34. And they understood none of these things. What stupidity
   was this, not to understand what Christ said to them in a plain and
   familiar manner, on a subject not too lofty or intricate, but of which
   they had, at their own suggestion, entertained some suspicion! But it
   is proper also to bear in mind -- what I have formerly observed -- the
   reason why they were held in such gross ignorance, which was, that they
   had formed the expectation of a joyful and prosperous advancement, and
   therefore reckoned it to be in the highest degree absurd, that Christ
   should be ignominiously crucified. Hence we infer with what madness the
   minds of men are seized through a false imagination; and therefore we
   ought to be the more careful not to yield to any foolish thoughts, and
   shut our eyes against the light.

   Matthew 20:20-23

   Mark 10:35-40

   20. Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons,
   worshipping, [651] and asking something from him. 21. And he said to
   her, What wilt thou? She saith to him, Grant that these my two sons may
   sit, one at thy right hand, and the other at the left, in thy kingdom.
   22. And Jesus answering said, You know not what you ask. Can you drink
   the cup which I shall drink, and be baptized with the baptism with
   which I am baptized? They say to him, We can. 23. He saith to them, You
   shall indeed drink my cup, and you shall be baptized with the baptism
   with which I am baptized; but to sit at my right hand, and at my left,
   is not mine to give; but it shall fall to those for whom it is prepared
   by my Father. [652]


   35. And James and John, sons of Zebedee, came to him, saying, Master,
   we desire that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall ask.
   36. And he said to them, What do you wish that I should do for you?
   37. And they said, Grant to us that we may sit, on at thy right hand,
   and the other at thy left, in thy glory. 38. And Jesus said to them,
   You know not what you ask. Can you drink the cup which I drink, and be
   baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized? 39. And they said
   to him, We can. And Jesus said to them, You shall indeed drink the cup
   which I drink, and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I
   am baptized: 40. But to sit at my right hand, and at my left is not
   mine to give; but it shall fall to those for whom it is prepared. [653]



   Matthew 20:20. Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children. This
   narrative contains a bright mirror of human vanity; for it shows that
   proper and holy zeal is often accompanied by ambition, or some other
   vice of the flesh, so that they who follow Christ have a different
   object in view from what they ought to have. They who are not satisfied
   with himself alone, but seek this or the other thing apart from him and
   his promises, wander egregiously from the right path. Nor is it enough
   that, at the commencement, we sincerely apply our minds to Christ, if
   we do not stead-lastly maintain the same purity; for frequently, in the
   midst of the course, there spring up sinful affections by which we are
   led astray. In this way it is probable that the two sons of Zebedee
   were, at first, sincere in their adherence to Christ; but when they see
   that they have no ordinary share of his favor, and hear his reign
   spoken of as near at hand, their minds are immediately led to wicked
   ambition, and they are greatly distressed at the thought of remaining
   in their present situation. If this happens to two excellent disciples,
   with what care ought we to walk, if we do not wish to turn aside from
   the right path! More especially, when any plausible occasion presents
   itself, we ought to be on our guard, lest the desire of honors corrupt
   the feeling of piety.

   Though Matthew and Mark differ somewhat in the words, yet they agree as
   to the substance of the matter. Matthew says that the wife of Zebedee
   came, and asked for her sons that they might hold the highest places in
   the kingdom of Christ. Mark represents themselves as making the
   request. But it is probable that, being restrained by bashfulness, they
   had the dexterity to employ their mother, who would present the request
   with greater boldness. That the wish came originally from themselves
   may be inferred from this circumstance, that Christ replied to them,
   and not to their mother. Besides, when their mother, bowing down,
   states that she has something to ask, and when themselves, according to
   Mark, apply for a general engagement, that whatever they ask shall be
   granted to them, this timid insinuation proves that they were conscious
   of something wrong. [654]

   21. In the kingdom. It was worthy of commendation in the sons of
   Zebedee, that they expected some kingdom of Christ, of which not even
   the slightest trace was then visible. They see Christ exposed to
   contempt under the mean aspect of a servant; nay more, they see him
   despised and loaded with many reproaches by the world; but they are
   convinced that he will soon become a magnificent king, for so he had
   taught them. It is unquestionably a noble specimen of faith; but hence
   we perceive how easily the pure seed is no sooner implanted in our
   hearts than it becomes degenerate and corrupted; for they imagined to
   themselves a kingdom which had no existence, and presently committed
   the folly of desiring the highest places. Since, therefore, this wicked
   ambition flowed from a general principle of faith, which in itself was
   highly commendable, we ought to pray, not only that the Lord would open
   the eyes of our mind, but that he would give us continual direction,
   and keep our minds fixed on the proper object. We ought also to pray,
   not only that he would bestow faith upon us, but that he would keep it
   pure from all mixture.

   22. You know not what you ask. Their ignorance was worthy of blame on
   two accounts; first, because their ambition led them to desire more
   than was proper; and, secondly, because, instead of the heavenly
   kingdom of Christ, they had formed the idea of a phantom in the air. As
   to the first of those reasons, whoever is not satisfied with the free
   adoption of God, and desires to raise himself, such a person wanders
   beyond his limits, and, by unseasonably pressing himself forward beyond
   what was proper for him to do, is ungrateful to God. Now to estimate
   the spiritual kingdom of Christ according to the feeling of our flesh
   is highly perverse. And, indeed, the greater the delight which the mind
   of man takes in idle speculations, the more carefully ought we to guard
   against them; as we see that the books of the sophists are stuffed with
   useless notions of this sort.

   Can you drink the cup which I shall drink? To correct their ambition,
   and to withdraw them from this wicked desire, he holds out to them the
   cross, and all the annoyances which the children of God must endure. As
   if he had said, "Does your present warfare allow you so much leisure,
   that you are now making arrangements for a triumphal procession?" For
   if they had been earnestly employed in the duties of their calling,
   they would never have given way to this wicked imagination. In these
   words, therefore, those who are desirous to obtain the prize before the
   proper time are enjoined by Christ to employ themselves in attending to
   the duties of piety. And certainly this is an excellent bridle for
   restraining ambition; for, so long as we are pilgrims in this world,
   our condition is such as ought to banish vain luxuries. We are
   surrounded by a thousand dangers. Sometimes the enemy assails us by
   ambush, and that in a variety of ways; and sometimes he attacks us by
   open violence. Is he not worse than stupid who, amidst so many deaths,
   entertains himself at his ease by drawing pictures of a triumph?

   Our Lord enjoins his followers, indeed, to feel assured of victory, and
   to sing a triumphal song in the midst of death; for otherwise they
   would not have courage to fight valiantly. But it is one thing to
   advance manfully to the battle, in reliance on the reward which God has
   promised to them, and to labor with their whole might for this object;
   and it is another thing to forget the contest, to turn aside from the
   enemy, to lose sight of dangers, and to rush forward to triumph, for
   which they ought to wait till the proper time. Besides, this foolish
   speed, for the most part, draws men aside from their calling; for as in
   battle the greatest coward is the keenest to seize the booty, so in the
   kingdom of Christ none are more eager to obtain the superiority than
   those who shrink from all the annoyance which attends toil. Most
   properly, therefore, does Christ enjoin those who were puffed up with
   vain glory to keep by their post. [655] The sum of the whole is, that
   for none but him who has fought lawfully is the crown prepared; and
   especially, that none will be a partaker of the life and the kingdom of
   Christ who has not previously shared in his sufferings and death.

   In the word baptism the force of the metaphor is very evident; for we
   know that by baptism believers are instructed to deny themselves,
   (Matthew 16:24;) to crucify the old man, (Romans 6:6;) and, in short,
   to bear the cross It is uncertain if, by the word cup, (poterion,) our
   Lord alluded to the mystery of the Holy Supper; but as it had not yet
   come into use, I choose to interpret it more simply as denoting the
   measure of afflictions which God appoints to every one. For as it is
   his right to lay on every one his own burden according to his pleasure,
   in the same manner as a householder distributes and allots the portions
   of the members of his family, so He is said to give them a cup to drink
   [656]

   These words contain no ordinary consolation for alleviating the
   bitterness of the cross, when in the cross Christ associates himself
   with us. And what could be more desirable than to have every thing in
   common with the Son of God? for thus are those things which at first
   sight appear to be deadly made to yield to us salvation and life. On
   the other hand, how shall he be reckoned among the disciples of Christ,
   who desires to be wholly exempted from the cross? For such person
   refuses to submit to the baptism of Christ, which is nothing else than
   to withdraw from the earliest lessons. [657] Now whenever baptism is
   mentioned, let us recollect that we were baptized on this condition,
   and for this purpose, that the cross may be attached to our shoulders.

   The boast made with so much confidence by John and James, that they are
   prepared to drink the cup, manifests the presumption of the flesh; for,
   when we are beyond the reach of darts, we think nothing impossible. And
   not long afterwards, the melancholy result exposed their rashness; but
   in so far it was good in them that, when they were free to make a
   choice, they presented themselves to bear the cross.

   23. You shall indeed drink my cup. As they were disciples, it was
   proper that they should be assimilated to their Master. Christ warns
   them of what will take place, that they may be prepared to endure it
   with patience; and, in the persons of two men, he addresses all his
   followers. For though many believers die a natural death, and without
   violence or shedding of blood, yet it is common to all of them, as Paul
   informs us, (Romans 8:29; 2 Corinthians 3:18,) to be conformed to the
   image of Christ; and, therefore,

   during their whole life, they are sheep appointed to the slaughter,
   (Romans 8:36.)

   Is not mine to give [658] By this reply Christ surrenders nothing, but
   only states that the Father had not assigned to him this office of
   appointing to each person his own peculiar place in the kingdom of
   heaven. He came, indeed, in order to bring all his people to eternal
   life; but we ought to reckon it enough that the inheritance obtained by
   his blood awaits us. As to the degree in which some men rise above
   others, it is not our business to inquire, and God did not intend that
   it should be revealed to us by Christ, but that it should be reserved
   till the latest revelation. We have now ascertained Christ's meaning;
   for he does not here reason as to his power, but only desires us to
   consider for what purpose he was sent by the Father, and what
   corresponds to his calling, and therefore distinguishes between the
   secret purpose of God and the nature of that teaching which had been
   enjoined on him. It is a useful warning, that we may learn to be wise
   with sobriety, and may not attempt to force our way into the hidden
   mysteries of God, and more especially, that we may not indulge
   excessive curiosity in our inquiries about the future state; for

   It hath not yet appeared what we shall be,
   till God shall make us like himself, (1 John 3:2.

   It is also worthy of our notice, that these words do not imply that
   there will be equality among the children of God, after they have been
   admitted to the heavenly glory, but rather that to each is promised
   that degree of honor to which he has been set apart by the eternal
   purpose of God.

   Matthew 20:24-27

   Mark 10:41-45

   Luke 22:24-27

   24. And when the ten heard it, [659] they were displeased with the two
   brethren. 25. And Jesus called them to him, and said, You know that the
   princes of the Gentiles rule over them, and they who are great exercise
   authority over them. 26. It shall not be so among you: but whoever
   wishes to be great among you, let him be your minister; 27. And he that
   wishes to be chief among you, let him be your servant: 28. Even as the
   Son of man came not that he might be served, but that he might serve,
   and that he might give his life a ransom for many.


   41. And when the ten heard it, they began to be displeased with James
   and John. 42. And Jesus, when he had called them to him, saith to them,
   You know that they who appear to rule over the Gentiles exercise
   dominion over them; and they who are princes among them exercise power
   over them. 43. But it shall not be so among you; but whoever wishes to
   become great among you, shall be your minister;. And whoever wishes to
   be chief among you, shall be your servant. 45. For even the Son of man
   came not that he might be served, but that he might serve, and that he
   might give his life a ransom for many.


   24. And there arose also a dispute among them, which of them appeared
   to be greatest. 25. And he said to them, The kings of the Gentiles rule
   over them; and they that have power over them are called benefactors.
   26. But you are not so: but he that is greatest among you, let him
   become as the younger; and he that is ruler, as he that serves. 27. For
   which is greater, he that sitteth at table, or her that serveth? Is it
   not he that sitteth at table? But I am in the midst of you as he that
   serveth.



   Matthew 20:24. And when the ten heard it. [660] Luke appears to refer
   this dispute to a different time. But any one who shall carefully
   examine that twenty-second chapter will plainly see that discourses
   delivered at different times are there brought together, without any
   regard to order. The dispute about the primacy, therefore which Luke
   mentions, flowed from this source, that the sons of Zebedee aspired to
   the first places in the kingdom of Christ. And yet the displeasure of
   the rest was far from being well-founded; for, while the foolish
   ambition of the two disciples was so severely blamed, that they retired
   from Christ with disgrace, what injury was it to the other ten, that
   those disciples foolishly wished what they did not obtain? [661] For
   though they had a good right to be offended at the ambition of those
   disciples, yet when it was put down they ought to have been satisfied.
   But our Lord intended to seize on this occasion for laying open a
   disease which was lurking within them; for there was not one of them
   who would willingly yield to others, but every one secretly cherished
   within himself the expectation of the primacy; in consequence of which,
   they envy and dispute with one another, and yet in all there reigns
   wicked ambition. And if this fault was found to be natural to
   uneducated men of ordinary rank, and if it broke out on a slight
   occasion, and almost without any occasion at all, how much more ought
   we to be on our guard, when there is abundance of fuel to feed a
   concealed flame? We see then how ambition springs up in any man who has
   great power and honors, and sends out its flames far and wide, unless
   the spirit of modesty, coming from heaven, extinguish the pride which
   has a firm hold of the nature of man.

   25. You know that the princes of the Gentiles rule over them. It is
   first said that Christ called them to him, that he might reprove them
   in private; and next we learn from it that, being ashamed of their
   ambition, they did not openly complain, but that a sort of hollow
   murmur arose, and every one secretly preferred himself to the rest. He
   does not explain generally how deadly a plague ambition is, but simply
   warns them, that nothing is more foolish than to fight about nothing.
   [662] He shows that the primacy, which was the occasion of dispute
   among them, has no existence in his kingdom. Those persons, therefore,
   who extend this saying indiscriminately to all the godly are mistaken;
   for Christ only takes occasion from the present occurrence to show that
   it is absurd in the apostles to dispute about the degree of power and
   honor in their own rank, because the office of teaching, to which they
   were appointed, has no resemblance to the governments of the world. I
   do acknowledge that this doctrine applies both to private persons and
   to kings and magistrates; for no man deserves to be reckoned one of
   Christ's flock, unless he has made such proficiency under the teacher
   of humility, as to claim nothing for himself, but condescend to
   cultivate brotherly love. This is, no doubt, true; but the design of
   Christ was, as I have said, to distinguish between the spiritual
   government of his Church and the empires of the world, that the
   apostles might not look for the favors of a court; for in proportion as
   any of the nobles is loved by kings, he rises to wealth and
   distinction. But Christ appoints pastors of his Church, not to rule,
   but to serve

   This reflects the error of the Anabaptists, who exclude kings and
   magistrates from the Church of God, because Christ declares [663] that
   they are not like his disciples; though the comparison is here made not
   between Christians and ungodly men, but between the nature of their
   offices. Besides, Christ did not look so much at the persons of men as
   at the condition of his Church. For it was possible that one who was
   governor of a village or of a city might, in a case of urgent
   necessity, discharge also the office of teaching; but Christ satisfied
   himself with explaining what belongs to the apostolic office and what
   is at variance with it.

   But a question arises, Why does Christ, who appointed separate orders
   in his Church, disown in this passage all degrees? For he appears to
   throw them all down, or, at least, to place them on a level, so that
   not one rises above the rest. But natural reason prescribes a very
   different method; and Paul, when describing the government of the
   Church, (Ephesians 4:11,) enumerates the various departments of the
   ministry, in such a manner as to make the rank of apostleship higher
   than the office of pastors. Timothy and Titus also, are unquestionably
   enjoined by him to exercise authoritative superintendence over others,
   according to the command of God. I reply, if we carefully examine the
   whole, it will be found that even kings do not rule justly or lawfully,
   unless they serve; but that the apostolic office differs from earthly
   government in this respect, that the manner in which kings and
   magistrates serve does not prevent them from governing, or indeed from
   rising above their subjects in magnificent pomp and splendor. Thus
   David, Hezekiah, and others of the same class, while they were the
   willing servants of all, used a scepter, a crown, a throne, and other
   emblems of royalty. But the government of the Church admits nothing of
   this sort; for Christ allowed the pastors nothing more than to be
   ministers, and to abstain entirely from the exercise of authority.
   Here, to it ought to be observed, that the discourse relates to the
   thing itself rather than to the disposition. Christ distinguishes
   between the apostles and the rank of kings, not because kings have a
   right to act haughtily, but because the station of royalty is different
   from the apostolic office. While, therefore, both ought to be humble,
   it is the duty of the apostles always to consider what form of
   government the Lord has appointed for his Church.

   As to the words which Matthew employs, the princes of the Gentiles rule
   over them, Luke conveys the same import by saying, they are called
   benefactors; which means, that kings possess great wealth and
   abundance, in order that they may be generous and bountiful. For though
   kings have greater delight in their power, and a stronger desire that
   it should be formidable, than that it should be founded in the consent
   of the people, still they desire the praise of munificence. [664]
   Hence, too, they take the name in the Hebrew language, ndyvym, (nedibim
   ) They are so called from bestowing gifts; [665] for taxes and tributes
   are paid to them for no other purpose than to furnish the expense
   necessary to the magnificence of their rank.

   26. It shall not be so among you. There can be no doubt that Christ
   refers to the foolish imagination by which he saw that the apostles
   were deceived. "It is foolish and improper in you," he says, "to
   imagine a kingdom, which is unsuitable to me; and therefore, if you
   desire to serve me faithfully, you must resort to a different method,
   which is, that each of you may strive to serve others." [666] But
   whoever wishes to be great among you, let him be your servant. These
   words are employed in an unusual sense; for ambition does not allow a
   man to be devoted, or, rather, to be subject to his brethren. Abject
   flattery, I do acknowledge, is practiced by those who aspire to honors,
   but nothing is farther from their intention than to serve But Christ's
   meaning is not difficult to be perceived. As every man is carried away
   by a love of himself, he declares that this passion ought to be
   directed to a different object. Let the only greatness, eminence, and
   rank, which you desire, be, to submit to your brethren; and let this be
   your primacy, to be the servants of all.

   28. As the Son of man Christ confirms the preceding doctrine by his own
   example; for he voluntarily took upon himself the form of a servant,
   and emptied himself, as Paul also informs us, (Philippians 2:7.) To
   prove more clearly how far he was from indulging in lofty views, he
   reminds them of his death. "Because I have chosen you to the honor of
   being near me, you are seized by a wicked ambition to reign. But I --
   by whose example you ought to regulate your life -- came not to exalt
   myself, or to claim any royal dignity. On the contrary, I took upon me,
   along with the mean and despised form of the flesh, the ignominy of the
   cross. If it be objected, that Christ was:

   exalted by the Father, in order that every knee might bow to him,
   (Philippians 2:9,10,)

   it is easy to reply, that what he now says refers to the period of his
   humiliation. Accordingly, Luke adds, that he lived among them, as if he
   were a servant: not that in appearance, or in name, or in reality, he
   was inferior to them, (for he always wished to be acknowledged as their
   Master and Lord,) but because from the heavenly glory he descended to
   such meekness, that he submitted to bear their infirmities. Besides, it
   ought to be remembered that a comparison is here made between the
   greater and the less, as in that passage,

   If I, who am your Master and Lord, have washed your feet, much more
   ought you to perform this service to one another,
   (John 13:14.)

   And to give his life a ransom for many. Christ mentioned his death, as
   we have said, in order to withdraw his disciples from the foolish
   imagination of an earthly kingdom. But it is a just and appropriate
   statement of its power and results, when he declares that his life is
   the price of our redemption; whence it follows, that we obtain an
   undeserved reconciliation with God, the price of which is to be found
   nowhere else than in the death of Christ. Wherefore, this single word
   overturns all the idle talk of the Papists about their abominable
   satisfactions Again, while Christ has purchased us by his death to be
   his property, this submission, of which he speaks, is so far from
   diminishing his boundless glory, that it greatly increases its
   splendor. The word many (pollon) is not put definitely for a fixed
   number, but for a large number; for he contrasts himself with all
   others. [667] And in this sense it is used in Romans 5:15, where Paul
   does not speak of any part of men, but embraces the whole human race.

   they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried aloud, saying, Have mercy
   on us, O Lord, thou Son of David. 31. And the multitude rebuked them,
   that they might be silent; but they cried out the more, saying, Have
   mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David. 32. And Jesus stood, and called
   them, and said, What do you wish that I should do to you? 33. They say
   to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. 34. And Jesus, moved with
   compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received
   sight, and they followed him.


   46. And they come to Jericho: and while they was departing from the
   city Jericho, and his disciples, and a great multitude, Bartimeus, son
   of Timeus, a blind man, was sitting hear the road begging. 47. And when
   he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry aloud, and to
   say, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me. 48. And many rebuked him,
   that he might be silent: but he cried out so much the more, Son of
   David, have mercy on me. 49. And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be
   called. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Be of good courage,
   rise; he calleth thee. 50. And he, throwing away his mantle, arose, and
   came to Jesus. 51. And Jesus answering, saith to him, What dost thou
   wish that I should do to thee? And the blind man said to him, Master,
   [668] that I may receive sight. 52 And Jesus said to him, Go away; thy
   faith hath cured thee. And immediately he received sight, and followed
   Jesus in the way.


   35. And it happened that, while he was approaching Jericho, a certain
   blind man was sitting near the road begging: 36. And when he heard a
   multitude passing by, he asked what it was. 37. And they said to him,
   that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. 38. And he cried out, saying,
   Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me. 39. And they that were going
   before rebuked him, that he might be silent: but he cried out so much
   the more, Son of David, have mercy on me. 40. And Jesus, standing
   still, commanded him to be brought to him: and while he was
   approaching, he asked him, 41. Saying, What dost thou wish that I
   should do to thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive sight.
   42. Then Jesus said to him, Receive sight: thy faith hath cured thee.
   43. And immediately he received sight, and followed him, glorifying
   God: and all the people when they saw it, gave praise to God.



   Matthew 20:29. And while they were departing from Jericho. Osiander has
   resolved to display his ingenuity by making four blind men out of one.
   But nothing can be more frivolous than this supposition. Having
   observed that the Evangelists differ in a few expressions, he imagined
   that one blind man received sight when they were entering into the
   city, and that the second, and other two, received sight when Christ
   was departing from it. But all the circumstances agree so completely,
   that no person of sound judgment will believe them to be different
   narratives. Not to mention other matters, when Christ's followers had
   endeavored to put the first to silence, and saw him cured contrary to
   their expectation, would they immediately have made the same attempt
   with the other three? But it is unnecessary to go into particulars,
   from which any man may easily infer that it is one and the same event
   which is related.

   But there is a puzzling contradiction in this respect, that Matthew and
   Mark say that the miracle was performed on one or on two blind men,
   when Christ had already departed from the city; while Luke relates that
   it was done before he came to the city. Besides, Mark and Luke speak of
   not more than one blind man, while Matthew mentions two. But as we know
   that it frequently occurs in the Evangelists, that in the same
   narrative one passes by what is mentioned by the others, and, on the
   other hand, states more clearly what they have omitted, it ought not to
   be looked upon as strange or unusual in the present passage. My
   conjecture is, that, while Christ was approaching to the city, the
   blind man cried out, but that, as he was not heard on account of the
   noise, he placed himself in the way, as they were departing from the
   city, [669] and then was at length called by Christ. And so Luke,
   commencing with what was true, does not follow out the whole narrative,
   but passes over Christ's stay in the city; while the other Evangelists
   attend only to the time which was nearer to the miracle. There is
   probability in the conjecture that, as Christ frequently, when he
   wished to try the faith of men, delayed for a short time to relieve
   them, so he subjected this blind man to the same scrutiny.

   The second difficulty may be speedily removed; for we have seen, on a
   former occasion, that Mark and Luke speak of one demoniac as having
   been cured, while Matthew, as in the present instance, mentions two,
   (Matthew 8:28; Mark 5:2; Luke 8:27 [670] ) And yet this involves no
   contradiction between them; but it may rather be conjectured with
   probability, that at first one blind man implored the favor of Christ,
   and that another was excited by his example, and that in this way two
   persons received sight Mark and Luke speak of one only, either because
   he was better known, or because in him the demonstration of Christ's
   power was not less remarkable than it was in both. It certainly appears
   to have been on account of his having been extensively known that he
   was selected by Mark, who gives both his own name and that of his
   father: Bartimeus, son of Timeus By doing so, he does not claim for him
   either illustrious descent or wealth; for he was a beggar of the lowest
   class. Hence it appears that the miracle was more remarkable in his
   person, because his calamity had been generally known. This appears to
   me to be the reason why Mark and Luke mention him only, and say nothing
   about the other, who was a sort of inferior appendage. But Matthew, who
   was an eye-witness, [671] did not choose to pass by even this person,
   though less known.

   30. Have mercy on me, O Lord. I stated, a little ago, that there was at
   first but one who cried out, but the other was induced by a similar
   necessity to join him. They confer on Christ no ordinary honor, when
   they request him to have mercy, and relieve them; for they must have
   been convinced that he had in his power the assistance or remedy which
   they needed. But their faith is still more clearly exhibited by their
   acknowledgment of him as Messiah, to whom we know that the Jews gave
   this designation, Son of David They therefore apply to Christ, not only
   as some Prophet, but as that person whom God had promised to be the
   only Author of salvation. The cry proved the ardor of the desire; for,
   though they knew that what they said exposed them to the hatred of
   many, who were highly displeased with the honor done to Christ, their
   fear was overcome by the ardor of desire, so that they did not refrain,
   on this account, from raising their voice aloud.

   31. And the multitude reproved them. It is surprising that the
   disciples of Christ, who follow him through a sense of duty and of
   respect, should wish to drive wretched men from the favor of Christ,
   and, so far as lies in them, to prevent the exercise of his power. But
   it frequently happens that the greater part of those who profess the
   name of Christ, instead of inviting us to him, rather hinder or delay
   our approach. If Satan endeavored to throw obstacles in the way of two
   blind men, by means of pious and simple persons, who were induced by
   some sentiments of religion to follow Christ, how much more will he
   succeed in accomplishing it by means of hypocrites and traitors, if we
   be not strictly on our guard. Perseverance is therefore necessary to
   overcome every difficulty, and the more numerous the obstacles are
   which Satan throws in the way, the more powerfully ought we to be
   excited to earnestness in prayer, as we see that the blind men
   redoubled their cry

   32. What do you wish that I should do to you? He gently and kindly asks
   what they desire; for he had determined to grant their requests. There
   is no reason to doubt that they prayed by a special movement of the
   Holy Spirit; for, as the Lord does not intend to grant to all persons
   deliverance from bodily diseases, so neither does he permit them simply
   to pray for it. A rule has been prescribed for us what we ought to ask,
   and in what manner, and to what extent; and we are not at liberty to
   depart from that rule, unless the Lord, by a secret movement of the
   Spirit, suggest to us some special prayer, which rarely happens. Christ
   puts the question to them, not for their sake as individuals, but for
   the sake of all the people; for we know how the world swallows God's
   benefits without perceiving them, unless they are stimulated and
   aroused. Christ, therefore, by his voice, awakens the assembled crowd
   to observe the miracle, as he awakens them shortly afterwards by a
   visible sign, when he opens their eyes by touching them.

   34. And Jesus, moved with compassion, etc. Splanchnistheis, moved with
   compassion, is not the participle of the same verb which Matthew had
   just now employed in reference to the blind man, eleeson, have mercy
   [672] They implored the mercy of Christ, that he might relieve their
   wretchedness; but now the Evangelist expresses that Christ was induced
   to cure them, not only by undeserved goodness, but because he pitied
   their distress. For the metaphor is taken from the bowels, (splanchna,)
   in which dwells that kindness and mutual compassion which prompts us to
   assist our neighbors.

   Mark 10:52. Thy faith hath saved thee By the word faith is meant not
   only a confident hope of recovering sight, but a loftier conviction,
   which was, that this blind man had acknowledged Jesus to be the Messiah
   whom God had promised. Nor must we imagine that it was only some
   confused knowledge; for we have already seen that this confession was
   taken from the Law and the Prophets. For the blind man did not at
   random bestow on Christ the name of Son of David, but embraced him as
   that person whose coming he had been taught by the divine predictions
   to expect. Now Christ attributes it to faith that the blind man
   received sight; for, though the power and grace of God sometimes extend
   even to unbelievers, yet no man enjoys His benefits in a right and
   profitable manner, unless he receive them by faith; nay, the use of the
   gifts of God is so far from being advantageous to unbelievers, that it
   is even hurtful. And therefore, when Christ says, thy faith hath saved
   thee, the word saved is not limited to an outward cure, but includes
   also the health and safety of the soul; as if Christ had said, that by
   faith the blind man obtained that God was gracious to him, and granted
   his wish. And if it was in regard to faith that God bestowed his favor
   on the blind man, it follows that he was justified by faith

   Matthew 20:34. And followed him. This was an expression of gratitude,
   [673] when the blind men became followers of Christ; for, though it is
   uncertain how long they discharged this duty, yet it showed a grateful
   mind, that they presented themselves to many, in that journey, as
   mirrors of the grace of Christ. Luke adds, that the people gave praise
   to God, which tends to prove the certainty of the miracle.

   Luke 19:1-10

   Luke 19:1-10

   1. And having entered, he passeth through Jericho. [674] 2. And, lo, a
   man named Zaccheus, and he was chief of the publicans, and was rich.
   3. And he sought to see Jesus who he was, [675] and could not on
   account of the multitude; for he was of small stature. 4. And running
   before, he climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him; for he was to
   pass that way. 5. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and
   saw him, and said to him, Zaccheus, make haste, and come down; for
   today I must abide at thy house. 6. And he made haste, and came down,
   and received him joyfully. 7. And when they saw it, they all murmured,
   saying, That he had gone to lodge with a man who is a sinner. 8. And
   Zaccheus stood, and said to the Lord, Lo, O Lord, the half of my goods
   I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any man in any thing, I
   restore fourfold. [676] 9. Jesus said to him, Today is salvation come
   to this house, inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham. [677] 10. For
   the Son of man came to seek and save what was lost.



   This shows how little attention Luke paid to observing the order of
   dates; for, after having detailed the miracle, he now relates what
   happened in the city of Jericho He tells us that, while Christ
   presented himself to the view of all, as he went along the streets,
   Zaccheus alone was very desirous to see him. For it was an evidence of
   intense desire that he climbed up a tree; since rich men are, for the
   most part, haughty, and plume themselves on affected gravity. It is
   possible, indeed, that others entertained the same wish, but this man
   was most properly singled out by Luke, both on account of his rank, and
   on account of his wonderful conversion, which took place suddenly. Now,
   though faith was not yet formed in Zaccheus, yet this was a sort of
   preparation for it; for it was not without a heavenly inspiration that
   he desired so earnestly to get a sight of Christ; I mean, in reference
   to that design which immediately appeared. Some were led, no doubt, by
   vain curiosity to run even from distant places, for the purpose of
   seeing Christ, but the event showed that the mind of Zaccheus contained
   some seed of piety. In this manner, before revealing himself to men,
   the Lord frequently communicates to them a secret desire, by which they
   are led to Him, while he is still concealed and unknown; and, though
   they have no fixed object in view, He does not disappoint them, but
   manifests himself in due time.

   5. Zaccheus, make haste, and come down. It is a remarkable instance of
   favor, that the Lord anticipates Zaccheus, and does not wait for his
   invitation, but of his own accord asks lodging at his house. We know
   how hateful, nay, how detestable the name of publican at that time was;
   and we shall find that this is shortly afterwards mentioned by Luke. It
   is therefore astonishing kindness in the Son of God to approach a man,
   from whom the great body of men recoil, and that before he is requested
   to do so. But we need not wonder, if he bestows this honor on one who
   was already drawn to him by a secret movement of the Spirit; for it was
   a more valuable gift to dwell in his heart than to enter his house. But
   by this expression he made it evident, that he is never sought in vain
   by those who sincerely desire to know him; for Zaccheus obtained vastly
   more than he had expected. Besides, the great readiness of Zaccheus to
   obey, his hastening to come down from the tree, and his joy in
   receiving Christ, exhibit still more clearly the power and guidance of
   the Holy Spirit; for, though he did not yet possess a pure faith, yet
   this submissiveness and obedience must be regarded as the beginning of
   faith.

   7. And when they saw it, they all murmured. The inhabitants of the town
   -- and, perhaps, some of Christ's followers -- murmur that he goes to
   lodge with a man who is looked upon as wicked and infamous, even though
   nobody invited him. It is thus that the world disregards the offer of
   the grace of God, but complains bitterly [678] when it is conveyed to
   others. But let us consider how unjust this murmuring was. They think
   it unreasonable that Christ should bestows so great an honor on a
   wicked man; for in this passage, as in many others, the word sinner is
   not taken in the ordinary sense, [679] but denotes a man of disgraceful
   and scandalous life. Let us suppose that Zaccheus was a person of this
   description. Still, we ought first to inquire for what purpose Christ
   chose to become his guest; for, while out of doors men are murmuring,
   within the house God displays magnificently the glory of this name, and
   refutes their wicked calumny.

   The conversion of Zaccheus was an astonishing work of God, and yet
   there was no good reason why Zaccheus should be marked with infamy. He
   had the charge of collecting the taxes. Now to collect taxes was no
   crime in itself, but men of that class were exceedingly despised and
   hated by the Jews, because they reckoned it to be in the highest degree
   unjust that they should pay tribute. But whatever might be the
   character of Zaccheus, still the kindness of Christ ought not to be
   blamed, but commended, in not refusing his assistance to a wretched
   man, to rescue him from destruction, and bring him to salvation. And
   therefore the offense which was wickedly taken did not hinder him from
   proceeding to execute his Father's command. With such magnanimity ought
   all his ministers to be endued, as to think more highly of the
   salvation of one soul than of the murmurs which all ignorant persons
   may utter, and not to desist from their duty, even though all their
   actions and words may expose them to reproaches.

   8. And Zaccheus stood, and said. From this result they ought to have
   formed their opinion of what Christ did; but men are so hasty and
   precipitate, that they do not take time to wait for God. [680] The
   conversion of Zaceheus is described by fruits and outward signs. As it
   was probable that he had enriched himself to the injury of others,

   if he had wronged any man, he was ready to restore fourfold. Besides,
   the half of his goods he dedicates to the poor. A man might indeed
   bestow all his goods on the poor,
   (1 Corinthians 13:3,)

   and yet his generosity might be of no value in the sight of God; but,
   though no mention is here made of inward repentance, yet Luke means
   that the godly zeal, which he commends in Zaccheus, proceeded from that
   living root. In like manner, Paul, when treating of repentance, exhorts
   us to those duties, by which men may learn that we are changed for the
   better.

   Let him that stole steal no more; but rather let him labor with his
   hands, that he may assist the poor and needy,
   (Ephesians 4:28.)

   We ought therefore to begin with the heart, but our repentance ought
   also to be evinced by works.

   Now let us observe that Zaccheus does not make a present to God out of
   his extortions, as many rich men give to God a portion of what they
   have obtained by dishonesty, that they may the more freely pillage in
   future, and that they may be acquitted of the wrongs which they have
   formerly done. But Zaccheus devotes the half of his goods to God in
   such a manner, as to give, at the same time, compensation for whatever
   wrongs he has done; and hence we infer that the riches which he
   possessed were not the fruit of dishonest gain. Thus Zaccheus is not
   only ready to give satisfaction, if he has taken any thing by fraud,
   but shares his lawful possessions with the poor; by which he shows that
   he is changed from a wolf not only into a sheep, but even into a
   shepherd. And while he corrects the faults which had been formerly
   committed, he renounces wicked practices for the future, as God demands
   from his people, first of all, that they abstain from doing any act of
   injury. Zaccheus has not laid others under obligation, by his example,
   to strip themselves of the half of their goods; but we have only to
   observe the rule which the Lord prescribes, that we dedicate ourselves,
   and all that we have, to holy and lawful purposes.

   9. Today is salvation come to this house. Christ, bearing testimony to
   Zaccheus, declares that his professions were not hypocritical. And yet
   he does not ascribe to the good works of Zaccheus the cause of
   salvation; but, as that conversion was an undoubted pledge of the
   divine adoption, he justly concludes from it that this house is a
   possessor of salvation Such, to is the import of the words for, since
   Zaccheus is one of the children of Abraham, he argues that his house is
   saved. In order that any man may be reckoned among the children of
   Abraham, it is necessary for him to imitate Abraham's faith; nay,
   Scripture expressly bestows on faith this commendation, that it
   distinguishes the genuine children of Abraham from strangers. Let us
   therefore know that in Zaccheus faith is chiefly commended, on account
   of which his good works were acceptable to God. Nor is there reason to
   doubt that the doctrine of Christ went before the conversion of
   Zaccheus; and, consequently, the commencement of his salvation was, to
   hear Christ discoursing on the undeserved mercy of God, and on the
   reconciliation of men to Him, and on the redemption of the Church, and
   to embrace this doctrine by faith.

   In consequence of the Greek word oikos; (house) being of the masculine
   gender, this passage is explained in two ways. The old translator [681]
   has made the reference to be to Zaccheus, which I also prefer. [682]
   Erastians has chosen to render it, inasmuch as The House, itself is a
   Daughter of Abraham; [683] and although I do not disapprove of this, I
   think it more natural to explain it as referring to Zaccheus For, since
   God, when he adopts the head of a family, promises that He will be a
   God even to his whole house, salvation is, with propriety, extended
   from the head to the whole body. Now the particle kai (also) is
   emphatic; for Christ means, that Zaccheus, not less than the other Jews
   who haughtily detested him, is a son of Abraham And that his former
   life may not seem to have shut against him the gate of salvation,
   Christ argues from his own office, that there is nothing in this change
   at which any man ought to take offense, since he was sent by the Father
   to save those who were lost.

   Matthew 25:14-30; Luke 19:11-28

   Matthew 25:14-30

   Luke 19:11-28

   14. For as a certain man, setting out on a journey, called his
   servants, and delivered to them his goods. 15. And to one he gave five
   talents, and to another two, and to another one; to every one according
   to his own ability; and immediately set out. 16. And he who had
   received five talents went away and traded with them, and amassed other
   five talents. 17. And likewise he who had received two, he also gained
   other two. 18. But he who had received one went away, and dug in the
   earth, and hid his master's money. 19. And after a long time the master
   of those servant cometh, and reckoneth with them. 20. And he who had
   received five talents, saying, Master, thou deliveredst to me five
   talents: lo, I have gained by them other five talents. 21. His master
   saith to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou has tbeen
   faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things: enter
   thou into the joy of thy master. 22. And he also who had received two
   talents came, and said, Master, thou deliveredst to me two talents: lo,
   I have gained by them other two. 23. His master saith to him, Well
   done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few
   things: enter thou into the joy of thy master. 24. But he who had
   received one talent came and said, Master, knew thee that thou art a
   harsh man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where didst
   not scatter: 25. And, being afraid, I went away, and hid thy talent in
   the earth: lo, thou hast what is thine. 26. And his master answering
   said to him, Wicked and slothful servant, thou knowest that I reap
   where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter: 27. Thou
   oughtest therefore to have given my money to the bankers, and, when I
   came, I would have received my own with usury. 28. Take away then from
   him the talent, and give it to him who hath ten talents. 29. For to
   every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound; but he that
   hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken from him. 30. And cast
   out the unprofitable servant into outer darkness, where shall be
   weeping and gnashing of teeth.


   11. While they were hearing these things, he added, and spoke a
   parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and because they thought that
   the kingdom of God would immediately be revealed. 12. He said
   therefore, A certain nobleman set out for a distant country, to receive
   for himself a kingdom, [684] and to return. 13. And, having called his
   ten servants, he gave to them ten pounds, and said to them, Trade till
   I come. 14. And his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him,
   saying, We will not have this man to reign over us. 15. And it happened
   that he returned, after having obtained the kingdom, [685] and
   commanded those servants to be called to him, to whom he had given
   money, that he might know how much everyone had gained by trading.
   16. And the first came, saying, Master, thy pound hath gained ten
   pounds. 17. And he said to him, Well done, good servant; because thou
   hast been faithful in a very small matter, have though power over ten
   cities. 18. And another came, saying, Master, thy pound hath gained
   five pounds. 19. And he said to him, And be thou ruler over five
   cities. 20. And another came, saying, Master, lo, thy pound, which I
   have kept laid up in a napkin: 21. For I feared thee, because thou art
   a harsh man: thou takest up what thou didst not lay down, and reapest
   what thou didst not sow. 22. He saith to him, Out of thy mouth will I
   judge thee, wicked servant. Thou knewest that I am a harsh man, taking
   up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow: 23. And why
   didst not thou give my money to the bank, and, when I came, I would
   have demanded it with usury? 24. And to those who stood by he said,
   Take from him the pound, and give it to him who hath ten pounds.
   25. And they said to him, Master, he hath ten pounds. 26. For I say to
   you, That to him that hath it shall be given; but from him who hath
   not, even what he hath shall be taken away. 27. But bring hither those
   my enemies, who refused that I should reign over them, and slay them
   before me. 28. And, having said these things, he went before, to go up
   to Jerusalem.



   Luke 19:11. While they were hearing these things. It was next to a
   prodigy that the disciples, after having been so frequently warned as
   to the approaching death of Christ, flew aside from it to think of his
   kingdom. There were two mistakes; first, that they pictured to
   themselves rest and happiness without the cross; secondly, that they
   judged of the kingdom of God according to their own carnal sense. Hence
   it appears how slight and obscure their faith was; for though they had
   entertained a hope of the resurrection, yet the taste was too slight
   for forming a fixed and decided opinion about Christ. They believe him
   to be the Redeemer who had been formerly promised, and hence they
   conceive a hope that the Church will be renewed; but that knowledge
   immediately degenerates into vain imaginations, which either overturn
   or obscure the power of his kingdom. But the strangest thing of all
   was, that so many warnings should have passed away from their
   recollection without yielding any advantage. At least, it was brutal
   stupidity that, though Christ had lately declared, in express terms,
   that he was just about to undergo a bitter and ignominious death, they
   not only remained unconcerned, but rushed forward, as if to a joyful
   triumph.

   12. A certain nobleman. Matthew interweaves this parable with others,
   without attending to the order of time; but, as his intention was, in
   the twenty-second chapter, to make a collection of Christ's latest
   discourses, readers ought not to trouble themselves greatly with the
   inquiry which of them was delivered on the first, or the second, or the
   third day within that short period. But it is proper to observe the
   difference between Matthew and Luke; for, while the former touches only
   on one point, the latter embraces two. This point is common to both,
   that Christ resembles a nobleman, who, undertaking a long journey for
   the sake of obtaining a kingdom, has entrusted his money to the
   management of his servants, and so on. The other point is peculiar to
   Luke, that the subjects abused the absence of the prince, and raised a
   tumult in order to shake off his yoke. In both parts Christ intended to
   show, that the disciples were greatly mistaken in supposing that his
   royal authority was already established, and that he was coming to
   Jerusalem, in order to commence immediately a course of prosperity.
   Thus by taking away the expectation of an immediate kingdom, he exhorts
   them to hope and patience; for he tells them that they must long and
   steadily endure many toils, before they enjoy that glory for which they
   pant too earnestly.

   Into a distant country. As the disciples thought that Christ was now
   about to enter into the possession of his kingdom, he first corrects
   this mistake by informing them, that he must undertake a long journey,
   in order to obtain the kingdom [686] As to what is meant by the distant
   country, I leave it to the ingenious expositions of those who are fond
   of subtleties. For my own part, I think that Christ expresses nothing
   more than his long absence, which would extend from the time of his
   death to his last coming. For, though he sits at the right hand of the
   Father, and holds the government of heaven and earth, and though, from
   the time that he ascended to heaven, all power was given to him,
   (Matthew 28:18,) that every knee might bow before him, (Philippians
   2:10;) yet as he has not yet subdued his enemies -- has not yet
   appeared as Judge of the world, or revealed his majesty -- it is not
   without propriety that he is said to be absent from his people, till he
   return again, clothed with his new sovereignty. It is true, indeed,
   that he now reigns, while he regenerates his people to the heavenly
   life, forms them anew to the image of God, and associates them with
   angels; while he governs the Church by his word, guards it by his
   protection, enriches it with the gifts of the Spirit, nourishes it by
   his grace, and maintains it by his power, and, in short, supplies it
   with all that is necessary for salvation; while he restrains the fury
   of Satan and of all the ungodly, and defeats all their schemes. But as
   this way of reigning is concealed from the flesh, his manifestation is
   properly said to be delayed till the last day. Since, therefore, the
   apostles foolishly aimed at the shadow of a kingdom, our Lord declares
   that he must go to seek a distant kingdom, that, they may learn to
   endure delay. [687]

   13. And having called his ten servants. We must not inquire anxiously
   into the number of the servants, or into the sums of money. For
   Matthew, by expressing various sums, includes a more extensive
   doctrine, namely, that Christ does not lay on all an equal charge of
   trafficking, but commits to one a small, and to another a larger sum of
   money. Both agree in this, that till the last day of the resurrection
   Christ, in some respects, goes to a distance from his people, but yet
   that it would be highly improper for them to sit down in idleness and
   do no good; for each has a certain office enjoined him, in which he
   ought to be employed, and, therefore, they ought to be diligent in
   trading, that they may be careful to increase their Lord's property.

   Luke says simply, that to each he gave a pound; because, whether more
   or less may be committed to us by our Lord, every man must equally give
   account for himself. Matthew, as I have said, is more full and copious;
   for he states various degrees. Let us know that the Lord does not
   bestow on all indiscriminately the same measure of gifts, (Ephesians
   4:7,) but

   distributes them variously as he thinks proper,
   (1 Corinthians 12:11,)

   so that some excel others. But whatever gifts the Lord has bestowed
   upon us, let us know that it is committed to us as so much money, that
   it may yield some gain; for nothing could be more unreasonable than
   that we should allow to remain buried, or should apply to no use, God's
   favors, the value of which consists in yielding fruit.

   Matthew 25:15. To every one according to his own ability. By this term
   Christ does not distinguish between natural gifts and the gifts of the
   Spirit; for we have neither power nor skill [688] which ought not to be
   acknowledged as having been received from God; and, therefore, whoever
   shall determine to give God his share will leave nothing for himself.
   What then is meant by saying, that the master of the house gives to
   each person more or less, according to his own ability? It is because
   God, as he has assigned to every one his place, and has bestowed on him
   natural gifts, gives him also this or the other injunction, employs him
   in the management of affairs, raises him to various offices, furnishes
   him with abundant means of eminent usefulness, and presents to him the
   opportunity.

   It is absurd, however, in the Papists to infer from this, that the
   gifts of God are conferred on every man according to the measure which
   he deserves. For, though the old translator, [689] employed the word
   virtus, [690] he did not mean that God bestows his gifts, according as
   men have acquitted themselves well, and obtained the praise of virtue,
   but only so far as the master of the house has judged them to be
   suitable. Now we know that no man is found by God to be suitable till
   He has made him so; and the Greek word dunamis, (power, ability,) which
   Christ employed, is free from all ambiguity.

   20. And he who had received five talents. Those who employ usefully
   whatever God has committed to them are said to be engaged in trading
   The life of the godly, [691] is justly compared to trading, for they
   ought naturally to exchange and barter with each other, in order to
   maintain intercourse; and the industry with which every mall discharges
   the office assigned him, the calling itself, the power of acting
   properly, and other gifts, are reckoned to be so many kinds of
   merchandise; because the use or object which they have in view is, to
   promote mutual intercourse among men.

   Now the gain which Christ mentions is general usefulness, [692] which
   illustrates the glory of God. For, though God is not enriched, and
   makes no gain, by our labors, yet when every one is highly profitable
   to his brethren, and applies advantageously, for their salvation, the
   gifts which he has received from God, he is said to yield profit, or
   gain, to God himself. So highly does our heavenly Father value the
   salvation of men, that whatever contributes to it he chooses to place
   to his own account. That we may not become weary in doing well,
   (Galatians 6:9,) Christ declares that the labor of those who are
   faithfully employed in their calling will not be useless.

   According to Luke, he says that he who gained five pounds obtains the
   government of five cities; by which words he informs them, that the
   glory of his kingdom will be very different at his last coming from
   what it now appears. For now [693] we have labor and anxiety in
   managing, as it were, the affairs of an absent master; but then he will
   have at his command an ample and copious supply of honors, to ennoble
   and enrich us. The form of expression employed by Matthew is more
   simple, Enter thou into the joy of thy master; by which he means that
   faithful servants, whose discharge of duty shall meet with his
   approbation, will share with himself a blessed abundance of all good
   things.

   But it is asked, What is meant by what is added, Take from him the
   talent, and give it to him who hath ten talents? For every kind of
   trading will then be at an end. I reply, We ought to keep in
   remembrance what I formerly mentioned, that those who insist on
   explaining, with exactness, every minute phrase, are mistaken. The true
   meaning is, though slothful and unprofitable servants are now endued
   with the gifts of the Spirit, yet they will at length be deprived of
   them all, that their wretched and shameful poverty may redound to the
   glory of the good. Now these slothful persons, Christ tells us, hide
   either the talent or the pound in the earth; because, while they
   consult their own ease and gratifications, they refuse to submit to any
   uneasiness; as we see very many who, while they are privately devoted
   to themselves and to their own advantage, avoid all the duties of
   charity, and have no regard to the general edification. When it is said
   that the master of the house, after his return, called the servants to
   account; as this ought to impart courage to the good, when they
   understand that they do not lose their pains, so the indolent and
   careless, on the other hand, ought to be struck with no small terror.
   Let us therefore learn to call ourselves daily to account, before the
   Lord come, and make a reckoning with us.

   24. I knew thee, that thou art a harsh man. This harshness has nothing
   to do with the substance of the parable; and it is an idle speculation
   in which those indulge, who reason from this passage, how severely and
   rigorously God deals with his own people. For Christ did not intend to
   describe such rigor, any more than to applaud usury, when he represents
   the master of the house as saying, that the money ought to have been
   deposited with a banker, that it might, at least, gain interest Christ
   only means, that there will be no excuse for the indolence of those who
   both conceal the gifts of God, and waste their time in idleness. Hence
   also we infer that no manner of life is more praiseworthy in the sight
   of God, than that which yields some advantage to human society.

   29. To every one that hath shall be given has been explained [694]
   under Matthew 13:12

   30. And cast the unprofitable servant into outer darkness. We have also
   explained, [695] under Matthew 8:12, that outer darkness is contrasted
   with the light which is within the house; [696] for, as banquets were
   anciently held, for the most part, at night, and were illuminated by
   numerous torches and lamps, of those who are banished from the kingdom
   of God, Christ says, that they are cast without into darkness

   Luke 19:27. But those my enemies In this second part, he appears to
   glance principally at the Jews, but includes all who in the absence of
   their master, determine to revolt. Now Christ's intention was, not only
   to terrify such persons by threatening an awful punishment, but also to
   keep his own people in faithful subjection; for it was no small
   temptation to see the kingdom of God scattered by the treachery and
   rebellion of many. In order then that we may preserve our composure in
   the midst of troubles, Christ informs us that he will return, and that
   at his coming he will punish wicked rebellion. [697]

   Luke 19:29-38

   1. And when they approached Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, to
   the mountain of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, [698] 2. Saying
   to them, Go into the village which is opposite to you, and immediately
   you will find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring
   them to me. 3. And if any man shall say anything to you, say, The Lord
   hath need of them; and immediately he will send them. [699] 4. Now all
   this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the
   prophet, saying, 5. Say to the daughter of Zion, Lo, thy King cometh to
   thee, meek, and sitting on an ass, and on a colt, the foal of one that
   is under the yoke. [700] 6. And the disciples went, and did as Jesus
   had commanded them. 7. And they brought the ass and the colt, and laid
   on them their garments, and placed him upon them. [701] 8. And a very
   great multitude spread their garments in the way; and others cut down
   branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way. 9. And the
   multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna
   to the Son of David: Blessed be he [702] that cometh in the name of the
   Lord; Hosanna in the highest. [703]


   1. And as they approach Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany, near the
   mountain of Olives, he sendeth two of his disciples. 2. And saith to
   them, Go away into the village which is opposite to you, and, just as
   you are entering into it, you will find a colt tied, on which no man
   ever sat; loose him, and bring him. 3. And if any man shall say to you,
   Why do you this? say, Because the Lord hath need of him; and
   immediately he will send him hither. 4 And they went away, and found a
   colt tied near a door where two ways meet, and they loose him. 5. And
   some of those who stood there said to them, What do you, [704] loosing
   the colt? 6. And they said to them as Jesus had commanded, and they
   allowed them. [705] 7. And they brought the colt to Jesus, and threw
   their garments on him, and he sat upon him, 8. And many spread their
   garments in the way; and others cut down branches from the trees, and
   strawed them in the way. 9. And they that went before, and that
   followed, cried, saying, Blessed be he [706] that cometh in the name of
   the Lord: 10. Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh
   in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest. [707]


   29. And it happened, when he approached Bethphage and Bethany, near the
   mountain which is called the mountain of Olives, he sent two of his
   disciples, 30. Saying, Go into the village which is opposite; and, as
   you enter into it, you will find a colt tied, on which no man ever sat;
   loose him, and bring him. 31. And if any man shall ask you, Why do you
   loose him? thus shall you say to him, Because the Lord hath need of
   him. 32. And they that were sent went away, and found as he had said to
   them. 33. And while they were loosing the colt, its owners [708] said
   to them, Why do you loose the colt? 34. And they said, The Lord hath
   need of him. 35. And they brought him to Jesus; and, having thrown
   their garments on the colt, they set Jesus upon it. 36. And while he
   was going, they strawed their garments in the way. 37. And when he was
   already of the mountain of Olives, the whole multitude of the
   disciples, rejoicing, began to praise God with a loud voice, for all
   the miracles which they had seen, 38. Saying, Blessed be the King that
   cometh in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven, and glory in the
   highest. [709]



   Matthew 21:1. Then Jesus sent two disciples Jesus sends his disciples
   to bring an ass to him, not because he was wearied with the journey,
   but for a different reason; for, in consequence of the time of his
   death being at hand, he intended to show, by a solemn performance, what
   was the nature of his kingdom. He had begun, indeed, to do this at his
   baptism, but it remained that this demonstration should be given by him
   towards the end of his calling: for why did he hitherto refrain from
   the title of King, and now at length openly declare himself to be a
   King, but because he is not far from the end of his course? [710] So
   then, as his removal to heaven was at hand, he intended to commence his
   reign openly on earth.

   This would have been a ridiculous display, if it had not been in
   accordance with the prediction of Zechariah, (9:9.) In order to lay
   claim to the honors of royalty, he enters Jerusalem, riding an ass. A
   magnificent display, truly! more especially when the ass was borrowed
   from some person, and when the want of a saddle and of accouterments
   compelled the disciples to throw their garments on it, which was mark
   of mean and disgraceful poverty. He is attended, I admit, by a large
   retinue; but of what sort of people? Of those who had hastily assembled
   from the neighboring villages. Sounds of loud and joyful welcome are
   heard; [711] but from whom? From the very poorest, and from those who
   belong to the despised multitude. One might think, therefore, that he
   intentionally exposed himself to the ridicule of all. But as he had two
   things to do at the same time, -- as he had to exhibit some proof of
   his kingdom, and to show that it does not resemble earthly kingdoms,
   and does not consist of the fading riches of this world, it was
   altogether necessary for him to take this method.

   To wicked men, no doubt, this might be very unacceptable, had not God
   long before testified by his Prophet that such would be the king who
   would come to restore the salvation of his people. In order, therefore,
   that the mean aspect of Christ may not hinder us from perceiving in
   this exhibition, [712] his spiritual kingdom, let us keep before our
   eyes the heavenly prediction, by which God conferred more honor on his
   Son under the revolting aspect of a beggar, than if he had been
   decorated with all the dazzling ornaments of kings. Without this
   seasoning, we shall never have any relish for this history; and
   therefore there is great weight in the words of Matthew, when he says,
   that the prediction of the Prophet was fulfilled [713] Perceiving that
   it was hardly possible that men, who are too much devoted to wealth and
   splendor, should derive any advantage from this narrative, when viewed
   according to the feeling of the flesh, he leads them away from the
   simple contemplation of the fact to the consideration of the prophecy.

   2. Go into the village. As he was at Bethany, he did not ask for an ass
   to relieve the fatigue of traveling; for he could easily have performed
   the rest of the journey on foot. [714] But as kings are wont to ascend
   their chariots, from which they may be easily seen, so the Lord
   intended to turn the eyes of the people on himself, and to place some
   mark of approbation on the applauses of his followers, lest any might
   think that he unwillingly received the honor of a king. [715]

   From what place he ordered the ass to be brought is uncertain, except,
   what may naturally be inferred, that it was some village adjoining to
   the city; for the allegorical exposition of it, which some give, as
   applying to Jerusalem, is ridiculous. Not a whit more admissible is the
   allegory which certain persons have contrived about the ass and the
   colt "The she-ass," they tell us, "is a figure of the Jewish nation,
   which had been long subdued, and accustomed to the yoke of the Law. The
   Gentiles, again, are represented by the colt, on which no man ever sat.
   Christ sat first on the ass for this reason, that it was proper for him
   to begin with the Jews; and afterwards he passed over to the colt,
   because he was appointed to govern the Gentiles also in the second
   place." And indeed Matthew appears to say that he rode on both of them;
   but as instances of Synecdoche occur frequently in Scripture, we need
   not wonder if he mentions two instead of one. From the other
   Evangelists it appears manifestly that the colt only was used by
   Christ; and all doubt is removed by Zechariah, (9:9,)who twice repeats
   the same thing, according to the ordinary custom of the Hebrew
   language. [716]

   And immediately you will find That the disciples may feel no hesitation
   about immediate compliance, our Lord anticipates and replies to their
   questions. First, he explains that he does not send them away at
   random, and this he does by saying that, at the very entrance into the
   village, they will find an ass-colt with its mother; and, secondly,
   that nobody will hinder them from leading him away, if they only reply
   that He hath need of him In this way he proved his Divinity; for both
   to know absent matters, and to bend the hearts of men to compliance,
   [717] belonged to God alone. It was, no doubt, possible that the owner
   of the ass, entertaining no unfavorable opinion of Christ, would
   cheerfully grant it; but to foresee if he would be at home, if it would
   then be convenient for him, or if he would place confidence in unknown
   persons, was not in the power of a mortal man. Again, as Christ
   strengthens the disciples, that they may be more ready to obey, so we
   see how they, on the other hand, yield submission. The result shows
   that the whole of this affair was directed by God.

   5. Say to the daughter of Zion. This is not found, word for word, in
   Zechariah; but what God commanded one Prophet to proclaim, the
   Evangelist justly and appropriately applies to all godly teachers; for
   the only hope, on which the children of God ought both to build and to
   rely, was, that the Redeemer would at length come. Accordingly, the
   Prophet shows that the coming of Christ yields to believers a full and
   complete ground of joy; for, since God is not reconciled to them in any
   other way than through the agency of the Mediator, and as it is the
   same Mediator who delivers his people from all evils, what can there
   be, apart from him, that is fitted to cheer men ruined by their sins,
   and oppressed by troubles? And as we must be altogether overwhelmed
   with grief when Christ is absent, so on the other hand, the Prophet
   reminds believers that, when the Redeemer is present with them, they
   ought to be perfectly joyful. Now though he bestows on Christ other
   commendations -- namely, that he is just, and having salvation --
   Matthew has taken but a single portion, which applied to the object he
   had in view, which is, that Christ will come, poor or meek; or in other
   words, that he will be unlike earthly kings, whose apparel is very
   magnificent and costly. Another mark of poverty is added, that he will
   ride on an ass, or the foal of an ass; for there can be no doubt that
   the manner of riding which belongs to the common people is contrasted
   with royal splendor.

   6. And the disciples went It was just now remarked, that the zeal and
   readiness of the disciples to obey are here mentioned with
   commendation; for the influence of Christ was not so great, that his
   name alone would be sufficient to produce an impression on unknown
   persons; and besides, there was reason to fear that they would be
   blamed for theft. It is therefore a proof of the deference which they
   paid to their Master, when they make no reply, but proceed readily
   towards that place to which he has ordered them to go, relying on his
   command and promise. Let us also learn by their example to press
   forward through every kind of difficulty, so as to render to the Lord
   the obedience which he demands from us; for he will remove obstacles,
   and open up a path, and will not permit our endeavors to be unavailing.

   8. And a very great multitude. Here the Evangelists relate that Christ
   was acknowledged as a king by the people. It might, indeed, appear to
   be a ludicrous exhibition, [718] that a multitude of obscure persons,
   by cutting down trees, and strawing their garments, bestowed on Christ
   the empty title of King; but as they did this in good earnest, and as
   they gave an honest testimony of their reverence, so Christ looked upon
   them as fit heralds of his kingdom. Nor ought we to wonder at such a
   beginning, when even in the present day, while sitting at the right
   hand of the Father, he commissions from the heavenly throne obscure
   men, by whom his majesty is celebrated in a despicable manner. I do not
   think it probable that the branches of palm-trees were cut down, as
   some interpreters conjecture, in accordance with an ancient and solemn
   rite appointed for that day. On the contrary, it would seem to have
   been by a sudden movement of the Spirit that this honor was rendered to
   Christ, when nothing of this nature had been intended by the disciples,
   whom the rest of the multitude imitated by doing the same thing; for
   this also may be inferred from the words of Luke.

   9. Hosanna to the Son of David. This prayer is taken from Psalm 118:25.
   Matthew relates expressly the Hebrew words, in order to inform us, that
   these applauses were not rashly bestowed on Christ, and that the
   disciples did not utter without consideration the prayers which came to
   their lips, but that they followed with reverence the form of prayer,
   which the Holy Spirit had prescribed to the whole Church by the mouth
   of the Prophet. For, though he speaks there of his own kingdom, yet
   there is no reason to doubt that he principally looks, and intends
   others to look, to the eternal succession, which the Lord had promised
   to him. He drew up a perpetual form of prayer, which would be observed,
   even when the wealth of the kingdom was decayed; and therefore it was a
   prevailing custom, that prayers for the promised redemption were
   generally presented in these words. And the design of Matthew was, as
   we have just hinted, to quote in Hebrew a well-known psalm, for the
   purpose of showing that Christ was acknowledged by the multitude as a
   Redeemer. The pronunciation of the words, indeed, is somewhat changed;
   for it ought rather to have been written, Hoshiana, (hvsy n') Save now,
   we beseech thee; but we know that it is scarcely possible to take a
   word from one language into another, without making some alteration in
   the sound. Nor was it only the ancient people whom God enjoined to pray
   daily for the kingdom of Christ, but the same rule is now laid down for
   us. And certainly, as it is the will of God to reign only in the person
   of his Son, when we say, May thy kingdom come, under this petition is
   conveyed the same thing which is expressed more clearly in the psalm.
   Besides, when we pray to God to maintain his Son as our King, we
   acknowledge that this kingdom was not erected by men, and is not upheld
   by the power of men, but remains invincible through heavenly
   protection.

   In the name of the Lord. He is said to come in the name of God, who not
   only conducts himself, but receives the kingdom, by the command and
   appointment of God. This may be more certainly inferred from the words
   of MARK, where another exclamation is added, Blessed be the kingdom of
   our father David, which cometh in the name of the Lord; for they speak
   thus in reference to the promises; because the Lord had testified that
   he would at length be a deliverer of that nation, and had appointed as
   the means the restoration of the kingdom of David. We see then that the
   honor of Mediator, from whom the restoration of all things and of
   salvation was to be expected, is ascribed to Christ. Now as it was mean
   and uneducated men by whom the kingdom of Christ was called the kingdom
   of David, let us hence learn that this doctrine was at that time well
   known, which in the present day appears to many to be forced and harsh,
   because they are not well acquainted with Scripture.

   Luke adds a few words, Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest; [719]
   in which there would be no obscurity, were it not that they do not
   correspond to the song of the angels, (Luke 2:14;) for there the angels
   ascribe to God glory in heaven, and to men peace on earth; while here
   both peace and glory are ascribed to God. But there is no contradiction
   in the meaning; for, though the angels state more distinctly the reason
   why we ought to sing, Glory to God -- namely, because through his mercy
   men enjoy peace in this world -- yet the meaning is the same with what
   is now declared by the multitude, that there is peace in heaven; for we
   know that there is no other way in which wretched souls find rest in
   the world, than by God reconciling himself to them out of heaven.

   Luke 19:41-44

   Luke 19:41-44

   41. And when he came near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,
   saying, 42. O if even thou, and at least in this thy day, hadst known
   and considered the things which belong to thy peace! but now they are
   hid from thy eyes. 43. For the days will come upon thee, and thy
   enemies will encompass thee with a rampart; [720] and will enclose
   thee, and will shut thee in on all sides; 44. And will level thee with
   the ground, and thy children who are within thee; and will not leave in
   thee one stone upon another; because thou didst not know the time of
   thy visitation.



   41. And wept over it. As there was nothing which Christ more ardently
   desired than to execute the office which the Father had committed to
   him, and as he knew that the end of his calling was to gather the lost
   sheep of the house of Israel, (Matthew 15:24,) he wished that his
   coming might bring salvation to all. This was the reason why he was
   moved with compassion, and wept over the approaching destruction of the
   city of Jerusalem. For while he reflected that this was the sacred
   abode which God had chosen, in which the covenant of eternal salvation
   should dwell -- the sanctuary from which salvation would go forth to
   the whole world, it was impossible that he should not deeply deplore
   its ruin. And when he saw the people, who had been adopted to the hope
   of eternal life, perish miserably through their ingratitude and
   wickedness, we need not wonder if he could not refrain from tears.

   As to those who think it strange that Christ should bewail an evil
   which he had it in his power to remedy, this difficulty is quickly
   removed. For as he came down from heaven, that, clothed in human flesh,
   he might be the witness and minister of the salvation which comes from
   God, so he actually took upon him human feelings, as far as the office
   which he had undertaken allowed. And it is necessary that we should
   always give due consideration to the character which he sustains, when
   he speaks, or when he is employed in accomplishing the salvation of
   men; as in this passage, in order that he may execute faithfully his
   Father's commission, he must necessarily desire that the fruit of the
   redemption should come to the whole body of the elect people. Since,
   therefore, he was given to this people as a minister for salvation, it
   is in accordance with the nature of his office that he should deplore
   its destruction. He was God, I acknowledge; but on all occasions when
   it was necessary that he should perform the office of teacher, his
   divinity rested, and was in a manner concealed, that it might not
   hinder what belonged to him as Mediator. By this weeping he proved not
   only that he loved, like a brother, those for whose sake he became man,
   but also that God made to flow into human nature the Spirit of fatherly
   love.

   42. O if even thou hadst known! The discourse is pathetic, and
   therefore abrupt; for we know that by those who are under the influence
   of vehement passion their feelings are not more than half-expressed.
   Besides, two feelings are here mingled; for not only does Christ bewail
   the destruction of the city, but he likewise reproaches the ungrateful
   people with the deepest guilt, in rejecting the salvation which was
   offered to them, and drawing down on themselves a dreadful judgment of
   God. The word even, which is interwoven with it, is emphatic; for
   Christ silently contrasts Jerusalem with the other cities of Judea, or
   rather, of the whole world, and the meaning is: "If Even thou, who art
   distinguished by a remarkable privilege above the whole world, -- if
   thou at least, (I say,) who art a heavenly sanctuary in the earth,
   hadst known " This is immediately followed by another amplification
   taken from the time: "Though hitherto thou hast wickedly and
   outrageously rebelled against God, now at least there is time for
   repentance." For he means that the day is now at hand, which had been
   appointed by the eternal purpose of God for the salvation of Jerusalem,
   and had been foretold by the prophets. Thus (says Isaiah) is the
   accepted time, this is the day of salvation, (Isaiah 49:8; 2
   Corinthians 6:2.)

   Seek the Lord while he may be found; call upon him while he is near,
   (Isaiah 55:6.)

   The things which belong to thy peace Under the word peace he includes,
   according to the meaning of the Hebrew phrase, all that is essential to
   happiness. Nor does he simply say, that Jerusalem did not know her
   peace, but the things which belonged to her peace; for it frequently
   happens that men are far from being unacquainted with their happiness,
   but they are ignorant of the way and means, (as we say,) because they
   are blinded by their wickedness. Now since the compassion is mingled
   with reproach, let us observe, that men deserve the heavier punishment
   in proportion to the excellence of the gifts which they have received,
   because to other sins there is added an impious profanation of heavenly
   grace. Secondly, let us observe, that the nearer God approaches to us,
   and holds out the light of sound doctrine, the less excusable are we,
   if we neglect this opportunity. The gate of salvation, indeed, is
   always open; but as God is sometimes silent, it is no ordinary
   privilege, when He invites us to himself with a loud voice, and in a
   familiar manner, and therefore the contempt will be visited by severer
   punishment.

   But now they are hid from thy eyes. This is not said for the purpose of
   extenuating the guilt of Jerusalem; for, on the contrary, it marks with
   disgrace the monstrous stupidity of that city, that, when God is
   present, it does not perceive him. I do acknowledge that it belongs to
   God alone to open the eyes of the blind, and that no man is qualified
   for understanding the mysteries of the heavenly kingdom, unless God
   enlighten him inwardly by his Spirit; but it does not follow from this
   that they who perish through their own brutal blindness are excusable.
   Christ intended also to remove an offense, which might otherwise have
   perplexed the ignorant and weak; for when the eyes of all were directed
   to that city, his example might have very great influence in both
   respects, either for evil or for good. That no man then may be
   perplexed by its unbelief and proud contempt of the Gospel, Jerusalem
   is condemned for disgraceful blindness.

   43. For the days shall come upon thee. He now assumes, as it were, the
   character of a judge, and addresses Jerusalem with greater severity. In
   like manner the prophets also, though they shed tears over the
   destruction of those about whom they ought to feel anxiety, yet they
   summon up courage to pronounce severe threatenings, because they know
   that not only are they commanded to watch over the salvation of men,
   but that they have also been appointed to be the heralds of the
   judgment of God. Under these terms Jesus declares that Jerusalem will
   suffer dreadful punishment, because she did not know the time of her
   visitation; that is, because she despised the Redeemer who had been
   exhibited to her, and did not embrace his grace. Let the fearful nature
   of the punishments which she endured now alarm us, that we may not, by
   our carelessness, extinguish the light of salvation, but may be careful
   to receive the grace of God, and may even run with rigor to meet it.
