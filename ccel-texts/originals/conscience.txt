     __________________________________________________________________

Prefatory note.

   These brief Discourses are included in the folio edition of Owen's
   Sermons, published in 1721, and are there, for obvious reasons, made to
   occupy a place by themselves. They were delivered at church meetings
   for the purposes of devotion and conference among Christian brethren
   (see p. 403); and they relate to a particular department of Christian
   ethics. Casuistry -- the science and doctrine of conscience -- is
   designed, as the name denotes, to resolve cases of doubt and
   uncertainty in regard to points of subjective morality. As a branch of
   theological inquiry and discussion, it has in a great measure fallen
   into disrepute. It came to be regarded with suspicion and odium from
   the use made of it by the Jesuits in the fifteenth and sixteenth
   centuries, who converted it into an engine of successful villany. It
   was denounced as "the art of quibbling with God;" and it was partly the
   casuistical system of the Jesuits against which Pascal, in his
   "Provincial Letters," launched with scathing effect the bolts of his
   brilliant sarcasm.

   But this science was for a time in great favour with the divines of the
   Reformation also; though studied and taught by them on different
   principles, and assuredly for very different ends. Mayer, a German
   theologian of the Lutheran Church (1650-1712), in his "Bibliotheca
   Biblica," has a list of the authors on Casuistry under three divisions,
   comprehending the Calvinistic, Lutheran, and Romish Churches. The
   science was at one time extensively cultivated in England, and by
   divines of eminent reputation. Sanderson, bishop of Lincoln after the
   Restoration, has two works on it, -- "Casus Conscientiæ," and "De
   Obligatione Conscientiæ Prælectiones." The "Ductor Dubitantium" of
   Jeremy Taylor is widely known as one of the most learned and important
   works on this subject. Baxter's "Christian Directory" deserves also to
   be, mentioned. Pike and Hayward's "Cases of Conscience" is a work that
   has been extensively circulated. There is a quarto volume in Latin
   entitled "Therapeutica Sacra," in which cases of conscience are
   discussed, by David Dickson, a Scotch divine, who, about 1650, was
   translated from the professorship of divinity in the University of
   Glasgow to the same chair in the University of Edinburgh. Four volumes
   of "The Morning Exercises" are occupied with the discussion and
   resolution of cases of conscience.

   Casuistry is liable to abuse, and has often been abused. It tends to
   foster a morbid subjectivity, and to enervate principle. Every
   Christian pastor, however, in the course of his official duties, must
   sometimes be called to resolve the doubts and scruples which are apt to
   embarrass the tender conscience. As handled by the divines to whom we
   have last referred, it really embraces all questions of Christian
   obligation and practice; and on some points their discussions are among
   the best treatises on practical religion in the language. Nor can the
   divine entirely overlook casuistry, even in the strict sense of the
   term, seeing the apostle Paul was very careful to direct and enlighten
   the consciences of Christians in his day, who scrupled to eat "things
   offered in sacrifice unto idols."

   It would be matter of regret, if the prejudice now entertained against
   a field of theological discussion cultivated to such an extent by
   divines of former generations, should prevent any reader from perusing
   the Discourses of our author which follow. Owen's was not the mind on
   any subject to be lost in obscure mysticism and refined subtilties, and
   to disport itself in a species of moral gymnastics, from which no overt
   and positive advantage could accrue to himself or to his hearers. These
   Discourses deal with momentous questions of religious experience, and
   are replete with suggestions and advices, which will be prized in
   proportion as the religion of the heart prevails, and so long as
   Christianity is not buried in formalism. The spirit which pervades all
   these brief but important Discourses, may be gathered from a weighty
   observation in one of them: "Suppose we should resolve with great
   earnestness, diligence, watchfulness, to abide in duties, in inward
   duties, to watch over our hearts, -- which is required of us; yet if in
   our so doing we are taken off thereby from frequent actings of faith
   upon Christ, as the spring of our life, we shall decay, under all our
   endeavours, watchfulness, and multiplication of duties." -- Ed.

Discourse I. [1]

   Question. What conviction of a state of sin, and of the guilt of sin,
   is necessary to cause a soul sincerely to look after Christ?

   Answer. There is one thing only that I shall at present speak to, and
   that is this: What is the lowest condition that hath the nature of
   conviction in sincerity, so as that souls may not be discouraged from
   closing with Christ because they have had no greater convictions of
   sin? And I shall speak to it on this account, -- because, although the
   things that have already been spoken by others are true, and such as
   those who have spoken them have found to be true by the word and their
   own experience; yet, it may be, others have not come up in their
   experience unto such a distinct observation of the work of conviction
   as hath been laid down, [so] that they may be discouraged. For, seeing
   conviction is so indispensably necessary, some may say, "It hath not
   been thus and thus with me, -- according as hath been declared."
   Therefore, I would only show what I judge to be so necessary, as that
   without it a soul cannot be supposed sincerely to have closed with
   Christ. And we having all made our profession of choosing and closing
   with Christ, as I would be loath to say any thing that might discourage
   any, lest they should have failed in the very necessary work of
   conviction; so I would not betray the truth of God, nor the souls of
   any.

   Therefore, I shall place it upon this: What Jesus Christ doth
   indispensably call men unto, in order to believing in him, that is
   indispensably required of them. And this I shall manifest out of two or
   three places of Scripture:-- Mark ii. 17, "I came not to call the
   righteous, but sinners to repentance." Now, this calling them unto
   repentance, is a calling them unto it by the faith which is in him. The
   apostle saith, 1 Tim. i. 15, "It is a faithful saying, and worthy of
   all acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save
   sinners." What kind of sinners doth Christ call? Whom he calls to
   repentance, he calls to faith; and whom he calls to faith, that they
   may truly believe, they are sinners, -- opposed unto them that are
   righteous: "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to
   repentance." "The righteous!" who are those righteous? The Scriptures
   tell us of these very men, that there were two sorts of them: First,
   Such as trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised
   other men. As long as a man trusteth in himself that he is righteous,
   Christ doth not call that man to believe. So long as a man is persuaded
   that his condition is good enough, he shall do well enough, that man
   hath no warrant to believe. Another description of these very persons,
   though upon another occasion, is given by the apostle Paul, Rom. x. 3,
   where he says, they were ignorant of the righteousness of God, and went
   about to establish their own righteousness. Though they did not come to
   trust in themselves for righteousness, yet sought righteousness as it
   were by the works of the law, and went about to establish their own
   righteousness; -- Jesus Christ doth not call these men to believe:
   these righteous persons have no ground for believing. What is the
   conclusion? "Lost sinners," saith Christ, "this is that I require of
   you." So that this is what I assert to be indispensably necessary, --
   namely, that they are so far convinced that they are sinners as to
   state and course, that they are not righteous in themselves, and can
   have no righteousness in themselves. I say, therefore, when a person is
   not really convinced that he is not righteous, he is not under the call
   of Jesus Christ; and if he doth believe this, he is under a sovereign
   dispensation, and let not such despond.

   Another direction of Christ is, "They that be whole need not a
   physician, but they that are sick," Matt. ix. 12. There are, in my
   apprehension, two things in a sick person that have need of a
   physician: First, He hath an uneasiness. A man who is sick, though he
   would shift it, yet his uneasiness will cause him to send for a
   physician. Saith Christ, "I come to such persons who say they can find
   no rest nor ease in their present condition." It may be they have often
   tried this and that, and see all will not do, -- they are sick still;
   conscience reflects, and their hearts are burdened, and they must have
   relief, or they shall not be free. Secondly, There is a fear that it
   will end in death. This puts the sick person upon sending for a
   physician. When the soul is made uneasy in its state and condition, can
   find no rest nor ease, it thinks, "If I abide here, I shall be lost for
   ever." This soul doth Christ call; this man will be at the charge of a
   physician, cost what it will.

   There is another word of Christ [which] very remarkably speaks just to
   the same purpose, Matt. xi. 28, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and
   are heavy laden, and I will give you rest," -- a soul finding itself
   under want, labouring after something whereby it may be accepted with
   God. I will not confine this to extraordinary instances, for sometimes
   he is found of them that sought him not; but the ordinary case of a
   labouring soul, before closing with Christ, is to abstain from sin,
   pray more or less, be found in duties, and under strong desires to be
   accepted with God. And what is the end of these labours and endeavours?
   They labour and are weary; -- that is, they see their labour comes to
   no effect; they do not find rest, and peace, and acceptance with God.
   And here is the turning point; Isa. lvii. 10, "Thou art wearied in the
   greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no hope." When the
   soul hath laboured for acceptance with God, and comes to be weary,
   saith Christ, "Come unto me." "No," saith the light of nature, "come
   unto me; trust unto your own endeavours." Saith the soul, "I will try
   what it will do; I will not say, There is no hope.'?" Saith another, "I
   will not say so; I will go unto Christ:" -- this is he whom Christ
   calls.

   Now, these things I do account indispensably necessary, antecedently to
   believing, as to the substance of them. And this, I hope, hath been
   found in all our souls. And if we have obtained so far, we need not
   then question whether our closing with Christ be sincere or not. This
   is all that I dare assert to be absolutely and indispensably necessary.
   Many pretend to believe, though they never were convinced thoroughly
   that they were not righteous, -- never were sick in their lives, --
   never had fears that they should die. These are contrary to the express
   rule Christ hath given, "I came not to call the righteous, but
   sinners;" -- not those that say, "There is hope," but those that say,
   "There is no hope."

Discourse II. [2]

   Question. Seeing the act of closing with Christ is secret and hidden,
   and the special times and seasons of our conversion unto God are
   unknown unto most, what are the most certain evidences and pledges that
   we have cordially and sincerely received Christ, and returned unto God?

   Answer. I do acknowledge the inquiry is very large, and such as we may
   be straitened in, through the abundance of it. I shall only speak
   plainly some few things that to me are an evidence of a sincere closing
   with Christ, and receiving of Christ, -- such as I know have been of
   use unto some.

   First. When there is a permanency and abiding in the choice we have
   made of Christ, notwithstanding opposition against it that we shall be
   sure to meet withal. I do not speak to the nature of the choice, or the
   means of it, -- how the mind is prepared for it; but I speak unto the
   poorest, the weakest of the flock, that may be inquiring whether they
   have made a sincere choice of Christ or not: I say, they may try it by
   the permanency and abiding in their choice against opposition.

   And there are two sorts of oppositions that will try us and shake us,
   as to our choice, as I have found it, if I have had any experience of
   these things -- 1. Opposition from charges of the guilt of sin and the
   law. 2. Opposition from temptations unto sin:--

   1. There will, even after sincere believing and closing with Christ, be
   many a heavy charge brought against a soul from the law, and the guilt
   of sin in the conscience. Now, in such a case, the inquiry is, What the
   soul abides by when it is shaken? Why, truly, if a man go only upon
   mere convictions, on such shaking impressions of the guilt of sin, he
   will be very ready and inclined in his own mind to tack about to some
   other relief. He puts out fair for his voyage, -- the storm arises, --
   the ship will not carry him; -- he must tack about for another harbour.
   I have known it so with some; and experienced, when the wind hath set
   very strong that way with myself, -- when the guilt of sin hath been
   charged with all its circumstances, -- the soul hath been very hardly
   able to keep its hold, yet notwithstanding resolved, "I will trust to
   Christ:" but it hath been tacking about to self again, -- "I must
   remedy this, -- have relief for this from myself; I cannot abide by it,
   and live wholly upon Christ; and when the storm is over, then I will
   out to sea again." I say, this is no good sign to me when things are
   so; but when a soul in all those charges that sometimes come upon it
   abides the issue, -- "Here I will trust upon Christ, let the worst come
   upon me;" -- this I call a permanency in our choice against opposition.
   I hope you have experience of it.

   2. There must be a permanency in our choice of Christ against
   temptations unto sin, as well as against the charges from sin. Truly,
   the former -- of abiding with Christ against the charges from sin -- is
   our daily work: it is sometimes more high and pressing, but it is our
   daily work. But there are also temptations unto sin, -- it may be to
   the neglect of our duty, or to a compliance in any evil way (which we
   are subject unto while in the body); and perhaps great sins. Here
   Joseph's reply, applied to Christ, is that which doth argue our choice
   of Christ to be sincere, -- "How shall I do this great wickedness, and
   sin against God?" When the soul can draw a prevailing argument from
   that, "How shall I do this, and relinquish my Lord Christ?" -- "I will
   not do this against him whom I have chosen," -- this is a good
   argument, if frequently reiterated, that our choice of Christ is
   sincere.

   Secondly. Growing up in a love unto the person of Christ is a great
   evidence to me of a sincere choice of Christ. It is a blessed field
   that is before me, but I shall but hint things unto you. When the soul
   hath received Christ, it cannot but study Christ; and though it is no
   argument against the sincerity of a man's faith and grace, that he doth
   principally regard the offices and graces of Christ, and the benefits
   we have by him, yet it is an argument against the thrift and growth of
   it: for a thriving faith and grace will come to respect principally the
   person of Christ. I mean this; -- when the soul studies the person of
   Christ, -- the glory of God in him, -- of his natures, the union of
   them in one person, -- of his love, condescension and grace; and the
   heart is drawn out to love him, and cry, "Doubtless I count all things
   but loss and dung for the excellency of Christ Jesus my Lord." "What is
   thy beloved more than another beloved?" "My beloved is white and ruddy,
   the chiefest among ten thousand; he is altogether lovely." To see an
   excellency, a desirableness in the person of Christ, so as to grow in
   admiration and love of him, is to me an evidence that, when all fails
   besides, will greatly support the soul, and persuade it that its choice
   is true. Nay, it is one of the most spiritual evidences; for I much
   question whether an unregenerate man can love Christ for his own sake
   at all. But it is a good sign of growth, when our love to the person of
   Christ grows, when we meditate much upon it, and think much about it. I
   could show you wherein the beauty of Christ's person doth much consist;
   but I have not time now to do it.

   Thirdly. Another evidence to me of the soul's having made a sincere
   choice of Christ is, when it continues to approve, judge well of, and
   every day more and more to see, the glory, the excellency, the
   holiness, the grace, which is in the way of salvation by Jesus Christ;
   approves of it as not only a necessary way, -- a way it has betaken
   itself to, because it must unavoidably perish in any other way, -- but
   when it approves of it to be a most excellent way, in pardoning sin
   freely through the atonement he hath made, and the imputation of his
   righteousness unto us, -- while the righteousness, the holiness, and
   the grace of God in all this is glorified. Saith the soul, "What a
   blind, wretched creature was I, that I did not see an excellency in
   this way before! It is better than the way of the law and the old
   covenant. I approve of this way with all my heart. If all other ways
   were set before me, and made possible, I would choose this way, of
   going to God by Jesus Christ, as the best way, -- that brings most
   glory to God and most satisfaction unto the creature, and is most
   suited to the desires of my heart, I would have no other way. I am the
   way, the truth, and the life,' says Christ; and this I will abide by,
   whatsoever becomes of me," replies the soul; "though I should perish, I
   will abide by it, since God hath given me such a discovery of the glory
   of saving sinners by Christ, that is inferior to nothing but the glory
   of heaven. I see that glory to God in it, -- that exaltation to Christ,
   whom I would love, -- that honour to the Holy Spirit, and safety to my
   own soul, -- that I will abide by it." A growing in the approbation of
   this way gives some assurance that we have made a true and sincere
   choice of Christ.

   Give me leave to add this one thing more:--

   Fourthly. That a delight in obedience unto God by Christ, in the ways
   of his own appointment, is a great evidence that we have chosen Christ,
   and he us; -- chosen him as our king, prophet, and priest. The ways of
   the worship of God in his church and ordinances, are the ways and
   worship of God in Christ, which he hath appointed. Take these things
   abstractedly and in themselves, and we should be apt to say of them, as
   was said of Christ, "There is no beauty in them, nor glory, that they
   should be desired." There is much more outward beauty and glory in
   other ways, that Christ hath not appointed. But if we love the ways
   Christ hath appointed, because he hath appointed them, then we choose
   those ways because we have chosen him to be our king; and that is it
   which gives them beauty and life. And when the ways of Christ's
   appointment grow heavy and burdensome to us, we are weary of them, and
   are willing to have our neck from under the yoke, -- it is a sign we
   grow weary of him who is the author of them; and this is a great sign
   that we never made a right and sincere choice of him.

   Many other things might be offered as evidences of sincere closing with
   Christ; but these are some which have been of use to me: and I hope
   they may be so unto some of you.

Discourse III.

   Question. What concern have we in the sins of the day wherein we live?

   Answer. All sins may be referred to two heads:-- First, Irreligion.
   Secondly, Immorality.

   First. Irreligion; and that may be reduced to two heads, -- atheism and
   false worship: you may add, also, particularly, the contempt of all
   instituted worship. It takes up much of the sins against the first
   table; however, at present I shall only speak of the first of them:--

   As to atheism, then, it may be no age can parallel that wherein we
   live, considering all the ways whereby the atheism of man's heart may
   discover itself. For, take it absolutely, and in the seat of it, it is
   found only in the heart of man; unless some one or other prodigious
   instance breaks out sometime, as we have had in our days: but
   otherwise, "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God." The
   heart is the seat of atheism. But we consider the ways whereby this
   atheism may and doth manifest itself:--

   (1.) By horrid, cursed, blasphemous swearing; which is a contempt of
   the name of God. And when did it ever more abound in this nation?

   (2.) By reproaching of the Spirit of God. Perhaps this is the peculiar
   sin of the nation at this day; and that the like hath not been known or
   heard of in any nation under the sun.

   (3.) By scoffing at all holy things; -- at the Scriptures, -- at every
   thing that carries a reverence and fear of God; so that a man who dares
   profess a fear of God in what he doth, makes himself a scorn.

   (4.) Contempt of all God's providential warnings is another proof of
   atheism. Never had a nation more warnings from God's providence, nor
   ever were they more despised. These things, brethren, are not done in a
   corner; they are perpetrated in the face of the sun. The steam of them
   darkens the whole heaven, and they abound more and more every day.

   Secondly. Shall we go to the other head, -- namely, Immorality, -- and
   see how it is there? It would be an endless thing, to go over the sins
   that reign among us: oppression, blood, uncleanness, sensuality,
   drunkenness, -- all to the height, raging and reigning in the nation. I
   mention these things as a matter to be bewailed before the Lord by us
   this day; and we ought to be affected with the consideration of them.

   Unto this great prevalency and predominancy of sin in the whole nation,
   there is added a strange and unspeakable security. The truth is, men
   were a little awakened one while in the nation. When the judgments of
   God -- the pestilence, the fire, the sword, and the year after, another
   warning from heaven -- were upon us, then there was a little awakening,
   like a man out of a dead sleep, that lifts up his head, and rubs his
   eyes for a time. But I can say this, that it is now towards forty years
   since God enabled me to observe something in the world; and, to my
   knowledge, I never observed this nation in that state of security
   wherein it is at this day. For, even in former times, there were
   warnings continually that God had a controversy with the nation; and
   those that had any fear of God spake one to another about it; and we
   saw and found their warnings were not in vain. But here is now a
   general security. Men complain of straits, want, poverty, and the like;
   but as to any thing wherein God hath to do with the world, either my
   observation doth greatly deceive me, or I never saw, I think, so
   general a security as at this day in this nation. And this security
   hath reached us all, -- even the churches of God themselves.

   These things are matter of fact. The whole question is, Whether we are
   greatly to be concerned in these things or not? "They are the sins of
   wicked men, and they are the sins of the persecutors of God's people,
   and the like; and what have we to do with them?"

   The psalmist of old said, that "rivers of waters ran down his eyes,
   because men did not keep the law of God." And you know that God doth
   set a special mark upon those, not that are free from the abominations
   of the age, but upon those that mourn for the abominations that are in
   the midst of us. It will not be enough for us, that we are free from
   those abominations, unless we are found to mourn for them. Brethren,
   our own hearts know we are guilty in this matter, and that we had need
   seek the face of God this day to give us a deeper sense of these things
   than we have obtained. The name of God is blasphemed, the Spirit of God
   reproached, a flood of iniquity spreads itself over the nation, the
   land of our nativity, over the inheritance of Christ, over a nation
   professing the reformed religion; -- all things go backward, -- every
   thing declines. Indeed, brethren, if you will not, I do acknowledge
   here before you, and to my own shame, I have great guilt upon me in
   this matter, that I have not been sensible of the abominations of the
   nation, so as to mourn for them and be humbled for them, as I ought to
   have been. And you will do well to search your hearts, and consider how
   it is with you; -- whether indeed you have been affected with these
   things; or whether you have not thought all is well, while all hath
   been well with yourselves and families, and, it may be, with the
   church, that may have no trouble upon that account. The security that
   is upon the nation is dismal; and, I may say, I see no way or means
   whereby the nation should be freed from this security. The conduct of
   the ministry, which they are under generally, is not able to free them
   from this security; nor the dispensation of the word: [so] that it
   seems to be a security from God to lead on the nation to judgment; the
   means for the removal of it and the awakening of us being laid aside.
   And if it comes this way, or that way, any way, though we see not the
   morning of it, you will find yourselves concerned in it. -- "Who may
   abide the day of his coming?"

   We may do well, brethren, to consider the state of the church of God in
   the world, among ourselves, and our own condition. I need not tell you
   how it is in the world; but this I can say, that to my apprehensions,
   the interest of Christ and the gospel was never so fast going down in
   the world since it came into it, as at this day. I will give you my
   reason of what I say: When the gospel was first planted and brought
   into the world, the devil was not able to bring the church into its
   apostasy, under six, or seven, or eight hundred years, and that by
   degrees. Since the time of the Reformation, the church was progressive
   for about seventy years; it stood at a stay about the same proportion
   of time; and ever since, it hath been going backward, straitened in all
   places: the power of it decays, and the peace of it is taken away, and
   destruction everywhere seems to lie at the door. Many, indeed, are in
   great misery and distress: some I have heard of lately sold for slaves,
   [3] for the testimony of their conscience. How is it with the church of
   Christ in this nation? Truly, some [are] in great poverty, in great
   affliction, in great distress; and I am afraid we and others have not
   hearts to relieve them, as we ought to do, in a due manner: however,
   let us help them with our prayers. And that which is worst of all,
   there seems to me, I must acknowledge it, to be a very great decay in
   all churches of Christ in the nation, especially among those of us who
   have had most peace, most prosperity. That which we call zeal for God
   is almost quite lost among us. Some of us have almost forgot whether
   there be such a thing as the cause and interest of Christ in the world.
   We who have cried and prayed about it, and had it upon our hearts, have
   sat down in our narrow compass, and almost forgot there is such a thing
   as the interest of Christ in the world, so as to have an active zeal
   for the ordinances of God according to rule, as God requires of us. Our
   primitive love, -- how is it decayed! Value of the ordinances of
   Christ, and the society of his people for edification, -- how cold are
   we grown in these things! How little is the church society upon our
   hearts, which some of us remember when it was the very joy of our
   souls! Truly we have reason to lift up our cry to God, that he would
   return and visit the churches, and pour out a new, fresh, reviving
   spirit upon them, that we fall not under the power of these decays till
   we come to formality, and God withdraws himself from us, and leaves us;
   which he seems to be at the very point of doing.

   Then, brethren, let us remember our own church; that God would in an
   especial manner revive the spirit of life, power, and holiness among
   us; that he would be pleased to help the officers of the church to
   discharge their duty, and not suffer them to fall under any decay of
   grace or gifts, unfitting of them to the discharge of their office to
   the edification of the church; that he would give them also to beware
   and take heed of formality as to the exercise of gifts in their
   administration; and that he would take care of us, since we are apt to
   fall under these things. Let us pray that we may be acted by the Spirit
   of God, and enlivened by the grace of God, in all things we do.

   Have any of us any particular occasions in reference to temptations,
   trials, and troubles? -- we may bear it upon our hearts to the Lord
   this day. This is much better than by multiplying a company of formal
   bills. The Lord help us to know the plague of our own hearts, and to be
   enabled to plead with the Lord, upon this opportunity, for grace and
   mercy to help us in every time of need!

Discourse IV. [4]

   Question. How may we recover from a decay of the principle of grace?

   Answer. We have been speaking concerning the decay of the principle of
   grace; and I will now offer you some few thoughts that may be applied
   unto our recovery from the decay of this principle. In doing which, I
   shall tell you no more than I think I have found myself.

   If we would recover spiritual life, we must come as near as we can
   unto, and abide as much as we are able at, the well-head of life.
   Christ is the spring of our spiritual life; he is every way our life.
   It is in a derivation of life from Christ, and in conformity to him,
   that we must look for our spiritual life.

   Before I mention how we should approach unto and lie at this well-head
   of life, let me observe to you this one thing, -- that when there is a
   general contagious disease (the plague, or the like), every man will
   look to his health and safety with reference to other occasions, but
   will be most careful in regard to the general contagion. Now, if
   forsaking this spring of life be the plague of the age, and the plague
   of the place where we live, and the plague of Christians, we ought to
   be very careful lest this general contagion should reach us, more or
   less, one way or other. It is evident to me, -- who have some advantage
   to consider things, as much as ordinary men, -- that the apostasy, the
   cursed apostasy, that spreads itself over this nation, and whose fruits
   are in all ungodliness and uncleanness, consists in an apostasy from
   and forsaking the person of Christ. Some write of how little use the
   person of Christ is in religion; -- none, but to declare the doctrine
   of the gospel to us. Consider the preaching and talk of men. You have
   much preaching and discourse about virtue and vice; so it was among the
   philosophers of old: but Jesus Christ is laid aside, quite as a thing
   forgotten; as if he was of no use, no consideration, in religion; as if
   men knew not at all how to make any use of him, as to living to God.

   This being the general plague, as is evident, of the apostasy of the
   day wherein we live, if we are wise, we shall consider very carefully
   whether we ourselves are not influenced more or less with it; as where
   there is a general temptation, it doth more or less try all men, the
   best of believers, and prevail more or less upon their spirits. I am
   afraid we have not, some of us, that love for Christ, that delight in
   him, nor do make that constant abode with him, as we have done. We have
   very much lost out of our faith and our affections him who is the life
   and centre, the glory and the power, of all spiritual life, and of all
   we have to do with God, -- Jesus Christ himself. I brought it in only
   to let us know, that if we would revive our spiritual life (and,
   believe it, if any of us are not concerned in our spiritual decays,
   these are sapless things, and will be heard with as much weariness as
   spoken), we are to abide more at the well-head of life. It is the
   direction of our Lord Jesus Christ, "Abide in me: unless ye abide in
   me, ye can bring forth no fruit. And every such branch shall be so and
   so purged."

   But you will say, "How shall we do so? how shall we abide, more than we
   have done, at this well-head of life?"

   1. We are to abide at the well-head of life by a frequency of the acts
   of faith upon the person of Christ. Faith is that grace, not only
   whereby we are implanted into Christ, but whereby we also abide in him.
   If so, methinks the frequent actings of faith upon the person of Christ
   are a drawing near to the well-head of life. And though we are to put
   forth the vigour, the earnestness, the watchfulness of our hearts unto
   obedience; yet a ceasing to continue in the acting of faith upon the
   person of Christ, even under the vigour of our own endeavours by those
   general, outward desires of walking with God and living to him, will
   weaken us, and we shall find ourselves losers by it. Do you all
   understand me? I am not teaching the wise and more knowing of the
   flock; I would speak unto the meanest. I say, suppose we should resolve
   with great earnestness, diligence, watchfulness, to abide in duties, in
   inward duties, to watch over our hearts, which is required of us; yet,
   if in our so doing we are taken off thereby from frequent actings of
   faith upon Christ, as the spring of our life, we shall decay under all
   our endeavours, watchfulness, and multiplication of duties. Wherefore,
   my brethren, let me give you this advice, -- that you would night and
   day, upon your beds, in your ways, upon all occasions, have the
   exercise of faith upon the person of Christ; faith working by a view of
   him as represented in the gospel, by trust in him, and by invocation of
   him, -- that he may be continually nigh unto you. And you cannot have
   him nigh unto you, unless you make yourselves, by these actings of
   faith, through his grace, continually nigh unto him: so you will abide
   at the well-head.

   I could show you those excellent advantages that we should have by
   continually being near to Christ, who is the overflowing spring of
   grace, and from whence it will issue out to us, if we abide with him,
   be nigh to him, and keep up to this well-head.

   2. Abide with him in love. Oh, the warm affections for Christ which
   some of you can witness concerning yourselves, -- that your hearts have
   been filled withal towards Christ, when you have been under his call to
   believe on him! And it is a marvellous way of abiding with Christ, to
   abide with him by love; which is called "cleaving to God and Christ:"
   it is the affection of adhesion, and gives a sense of union.

   "How, then, shall we get our hearts to abide with Christ by love?"

   This is a subject that if I were to preach upon, how many things would
   presently offer themselves to us, from the excellency of his person,
   from the excellency of his love, from our necessity of him, the
   advantages and benefits we have by him, and his kindness towards us!
   All these things, and many more, would quickly present themselves unto
   us.

   But I will name but one thing, and I name it the rather, because I
   heard it mentioned in prayer since I came in: Labour to have your
   hearts filled with a love to Jesus Christ, as there is in him made a
   representation of all divine excellencies. This was God's glorious
   design. It is not to be separated from his design of glorifying himself
   in the work of redemption; for a great part of God's glorious design in
   the incarnation of Christ, was in him to represent himself unto us,
   "who is the image of the invisible God, the express image of his
   person." Now, if you do but consider Christ as God is gloriously
   represented unto you in him, you will find him the most proper object
   for divine love, -- for that love which is wrought in your hearts by
   the Holy Ghost, for that love that hath sweetness, complacency,
   satisfaction in it. Then, let us remember that we exercise our minds to
   consider Christ, as all the lovely properties of the divine nature and
   counsels of his will, as to love and grace, are manifested by Christ.

   If we would abide at the well-head of life, we must abide in these
   things; and let love be excited to Christ under this especial
   consideration, -- as he who represents the supreme object of your love,
   God himself, in all the glorious properties of his nature.

   3. Add meditation hereunto; study Christ more, and all the things of
   Christ; delight more in the hearing and preaching of Christ. He is our
   best friend; let not the difficulties of the mystery of his person and
   grace deter you. There are wonderful things of the counsels of heaven,
   and of the glory of the holy God, in the person of Christ as the head
   of the church; if you would be found inquiring into them, an
   unsearchable treasure of divine wisdom, grace, and love is laid up in
   Christ: therefore meditate upon them more. Let me assure you this will
   prove the best expedient for the recovery of our spiritual life. And I
   will abide by this doctrine to eternity, that without it we shall never
   recover spiritual life to the glory of God in Christ.

   4. And then, brethren, seeing we have, in the next place, felt decays
   in the midst of the performance of multiplied duties, labour to bring
   spirituality into your duties.

   "What is that," you will say, "and wherein doth it consist?"

   It is the due exercise of every grace that is required to the discharge
   of that duty. Let every such grace be in its due exercise, and that is
   to be spiritual in duty. As, for instance, would a man be spiritual in
   all his prayers? -- let him, then, consider what grace and what
   exercise of grace is required to this duty. A due fear and reverence of
   the name of God; faith, love, and delight in him; an humble sense of
   his own wants, earnest desires of supply, dependence upon God for
   guidance, and the like; -- we all know that these are the graces
   required to the discharge of this duty of praying by the Holy Ghost.
   And let these graces be in a due exercise, and then you are spiritual
   in this duty. Is the duty charity, -- giving a supply to the poor?
   There is to be a ready mind, a compassionateness of heart, and
   obedience unto the command of Christ in that particular. These are the
   graces required to the discharge of that duty, and to watch against the
   contrary vices. So that if we would bring spirituality into duty, it is
   to exercise the graces that are required by the rule to the performance
   of that duty.

   I shall only farther give you this one caution, -- have a care that
   your head in notion and your tongue in talk do not too fast empty your
   hearts of truth. We are apt to lay it up in our heads by notions, and
   bring it forth in talk, and not let it be in our hearts; and this
   weakens spiritual life greatly. Ye hear the word preached; and it is of
   great concernment what account we shall give of the word that hath been
   preached unto you: for we that preach must give an account of our
   preaching, and so must you of what you hear; and many a good word is
   spoken, truly, and yet we see but little fruit of it. And the reason of
   this is, that some, when they hear it, take no farther regard of it,
   but "let it slip," as the apostle speaks, Heb. ii. 1. And if we
   complain of the treacherousness of our memories, -- it is the most
   harmless way of the slipping out of the word. It is not the treachery
   of our memories, but of our hearts and affections, that makes the heart
   like a broken vessel, -- that makes all the rents in it where the water
   runs out, as the comparison is. The word slips out by putting your
   affections into carnal exercise; and it quickly finds its way to depart
   from the heart that gives it no better entertainment. We talk away a
   sermon and the sense of it; which robs us both of the sermon and the
   fruit of it. A man hears a good word of truth, and, instead of taking
   the power of it into his heart, he takes the notion of it into his
   mind, and is satisfied therewith. But this is not the way to thrive.
   God grant that we may never preach to you any thing but what we may
   labour to have an experience of the power of it in our own hearts, and
   to profit ourselves by the word wherewith we design to profit others!
   And I pray God grant that you also may have some profit by the word
   dispensed to you, -- that it slip not out through carnal affections,
   and be not drawn out through notions and talk, with a regardlessness to
   treasure it up in your hearts!

   These things we are diligently to attend unto, if we would recover our
   spiritual losses that we are complaining of, and that not without just
   cause.

Discourse V. [5]

   Question. It was queried by some, how we may make our application unto
   Christ; not in general, but under what notion and apprehension of the
   person of Christ?

   Answer. Because some seem to apprehend there might be danger in
   terminating our worship upon the nature of Christ as a creature, I
   shall give you my thoughts and directions in it. And, --

   First. You must observe we are to have no conceptions, in our acting of
   any duty, towards Christ or about him, but with respect unto his person
   as he is God and man in one person. It is not lawful for us to have any
   apprehensions of Christ, to make any application to him, as man only;
   nor is it lawful for us to have any apprehensions of him as God only:
   but all our apprehensions of Christ, and all our addresses unto him,
   must be as God and man in one person. So he is, and so he will be to
   all eternity. The union is inseparable and indissoluble; and for any
   man to make his application unto Christ either as God or as man, is to
   set up a false Christ. Christ is God and man in one person, and no
   other. So, in all our actings of faith upon him, and applications unto
   him, we ought to consider him as he was "the seed of David," and as
   "God over all, blessed for ever," in one person. This makes the great
   idolatry among the Papists; -- in the image of Christ they represent
   the human nature of Christ separated from his Deity; for they can make
   no representation of one that is God and man in one person: hereby they
   become guilty of double idolatry, referring the mind unto one that is a
   man, and no more, -- and doing it by means of an image.

   Secondly. The person of Christ is the immediate and proper object of
   all divine worship. The worship of Christ is commanded in the first
   commandment. By worship, I intend faith, love, trust, subjection of
   soul, invocation on the name of Christ, -- every act of the soul and
   mind whereby we ascribe infinite divine excellencies unto God; which is
   the worship of the mind. See John v. 23. It is the will of God "that
   all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father." How do
   we honour the Father? By divine faith, trust, love, and worship; making
   him our end and our reward. So the Son is to be honoured. And as to the
   divine person of the Son of God, being of the same nature, essence, and
   substance with the Father, there is no dispute of that among them by
   whom his Deity is acknowledged.

   Thirdly. The divine person of the Son of God lost nothing of his glory
   and honour that was due unto him by the assumption of our human nature.
   Though thereby he became the Son of man as well as the Son of God, -- a
   Lamb for sacrifice; yet he is still, in his whole and entire person,
   the object of all that worship I spake of before; -- and the whole
   church of God agree together in giving that worship unto him, Rev. v.
   8, 9, 11-13, "And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four
   and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them
   harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of
   saints. And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the
   book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast
   redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and
   people, and nation. And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels
   round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of
   them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;
   saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive
   power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and
   blessing. And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and
   under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them,
   heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him
   that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever."
   Jesus Christ is here distinguished from the Father. There is, "He that
   sitteth upon the throne," and "The Lamb;" and he is considered as
   incarnate, -- as a Lamb slain: and yet there is all the glory, honour,
   praise, and worship, that is given to him that sitteth upon the throne,
   the Father, given to Jesus Christ, God and man, the Lamb slain, who
   hath redeemed us with his blood.

   Fourthly. This person of Christ, God-man, must not be so much as
   severed by any conception of the mind. For distinction, as God and man,
   he may be considered two ways; either absolutely in himself, or in the
   discharge of his mediatory office. And this double consideration
   produceth a double kind of worship to the person of Christ.

   1. Consider Christ absolutely in his own person, as the Son of God
   incarnate; and so he is the immediate and ultimate object of our faith,
   prayer, and invocation. So that a man may lawfully, under the guidance
   and conduct of the Spirit of God, direct his prayer immediately to the
   person of Christ. You have the example of Stephen in his last prayer.
   "Lord Jesus," saith he, "receive my spirit." These were the words of
   our Lord Jesus Christ when he died, "Father, into thy hands I commend
   my spirit." And Stephen, when he died, committed his spirit into the
   hands of Jesus Christ: "Lord Jesus," (for that is the name of the Son
   of God incarnate, "He shall be called Jesus, for he shall save his
   people from their sins,") "receive my spirit." So that a person may
   make an immediate address in his prayers and supplications unto the
   person of Christ, as God and man. I look upon it as the highest act of
   faith that a believer is called unto in this world, -- to resign a
   departing soul into his hands, letting go all present things and future
   hopes; to resign, I say, a departing soul quietly and peaceably into
   the hands of Christ. Now, this Stephen did with respect unto Jesus:
   "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." There he left himself by faith. So we
   may apply ourselves unto him upon any other account, in the acting of
   faith, upon any other occasion.

   2. Consider Christ in the discharge of his mediatory office. And under
   that formal consideration, as discharging his mediatory office, he is
   not the ultimate object of our faith and invocation; but we call upon
   God, even the Father, in the name of Jesus Christ. "We through Christ
   have believed in God," saith Peter in one of his epistles. And it
   implies a contradiction to have it otherwise: for the calling him
   Mediator, showeth he is a means between God and us; and so it is
   contradictory to say our faith is terminated on his mediatory office.
   This he calls asking the Father in his name: "You shall ask the Father
   in my name;" that is, expressly plead the intervention of the mediation
   of Christ. And so the apostle tells us, in that grand rubric and
   directory of church worship, Eph. ii. 18, "By whom we have access by
   one Spirit unto the Father." The Father is proposed as the ultimate
   object of access in our worship; and the Spirit is the effecting cause,
   enabling us unto this worship; and the Son is the means whereby we
   approach unto God.

   All that I shall add hereunto is this:-- Seeing there is in Scripture a
   double worship of Christ that is immediate (for his person is
   considered absolutely, and as mediator between God and man), which of
   these ought we principally to apply ourselves unto?

   I answer plainly, --

   (1.) Our direction for solemn worship in the church generally respects
   Christ as mediator, in Scripture. The general worship that is to be
   performed unto God in the assemblies of the saints, doth look upon
   Christ as executing his mediatory office; and so our address is unto
   the throne of grace by him. By him we enter into the holy place, --
   through him and by him unto God. "I bow my knees unto (God) the Father
   of our Lord Jesus Christ," Eph. iii. 14. God, considered as the Father
   of our Lord Jesus Christ, is the proper, ultimate object of the solemn
   worship of the church.

   (2.) In treating and dealing about our own souls, under the conduct of
   the Spirit of God, it is lawful and expedient for us in our prayers and
   supplications to make addresses to the person of Christ; as Stephen
   did.

Discourse VI. [6]

   Question. How may we make our addresses to Christ for the exercise of
   grace; that is, that we may have grace strengthened, and be ready for
   all exercise? or, How may we make application to Christ, that we may
   receive grace from him to recover from decays?

   Answer. I think the direction given by our Saviour himself is so plain,
   and doth so fall in with our experience, that we need not look much
   farther. Saith he, "Unless ye abide in me, ye cannot bear fruit." The
   business we aim at is fruit-bearing; which consists as much in the
   internal, vigorous actings of grace, as in the performance of outward
   duties, -- to be faithful in our minds and souls, as well as in our
   lives. "The way for that," saith our Saviour, "is, Abide in me.'?" And
   unless we do so, he tells us plainly, do we whatever we will else, we
   "cannot bring forth fruit." So that the whole of our fruitfulness
   depends upon our abiding in Christ. There cannot, then, be much more
   said unto this business, but to inquire a little what it is to abide in
   Christ.

   Certainly, it is not a mere not going off from Christ; as we say, a man
   abides when he doth not go away. For I hope that, under all the decays
   we have complained of, and want of fruitfulness, yet we have not left
   Christ, and gone away from him. We have so far abode in him as the
   branch abideth in the root, from whence it hath its communication and
   supplies. Therefore there is something in particular included in this
   abiding in Christ, dwelling in Christ, and Christ dwelling in us.

   And there seems to be this in it, -- that to abide in Christ, is to be
   always nigh unto Christ, in the spiritual company of Christ, and in
   communication with Christ. It doth not lie in a naked, essential act of
   believing, whereby we are implanted into Christ, and will not go from
   him; but there is something of an especial, spiritual activity of soul
   in this abiding in Christ: it is abiding with him, and in his presence.

   And as this abiding with Christ must be by some acts of our souls, let
   us consider what acts those are; which may give a little farther light
   into this matter. And, First, It must be, certainly, by some act of our
   minds. Secondly, By some act of our wills. Thirdly, By some act of our
   affections. And thus we abide with Christ; which is the way certainly
   to bring forth fruit.

   First. There is an abiding with Christ in our minds. Now this, to me,
   is in contemplation and thoughts of him night and day, -- "I sought him
   on my bed, in the night," saith the spouse; -- to consider very much
   the person of Christ, to contemplate upon him as vested with his
   glorious office, and as intrusted and designed by the Father to this
   work. "We all," saith the apostle, "with open face beholding the glory
   of the Lord as in a glass, are changed into the same image from glory
   to glory, by the Spirit of the Lord." My brethren, that which you and I
   are aiming at is, to be "changed into the same image;" that is, into
   the image and likeness of the glory of God in Christ. I dare boldly
   say, by those of us who have reason to have daily apprehensions of our
   going out of the world, and leaving this state of things, that we have
   no greater desire, nor is there any thing more frequent in our minds,
   than this, that we may be more and more changed into that image before
   we go out of this world; for we are looking after perfection in
   likeness to Christ. Therefore aged Christians especially will bear
   witness, that there is nothing now we long for more than to be more and
   more changed into the image and likeness of Christ. How shall we get to
   this? Why, saith he, "The way is, by looking steadily upon Christ, as a
   man looks with an optic glass to an object at a great distance. We
   behold him," saith he, "by looking steadily upon Christ himself, and
   the glory of God in him." Now there is a wonderful large object for us
   to behold; for when you look upon the glory of God in Christ, you have
   what you please of Christ for the object of your eye and view; the
   person of Christ, the office of Christ, the merit of Christ, the
   example of Christ, the death of Christ, and what you will, so you be
   much intent in your thoughts and minds, much in immediate contemplation
   about Christ. I do not know how you find it, brethren; but it is the
   advice I would give you who are aged Christians, and not likely to
   continue long in this world, to exercise yourselves in immediate
   contemplations upon Christ. All the teachings you have had from
   ministers, the principal end of them has been to enable you to this;
   and really, if I know any thing, we shall find them accompanied with a
   sweet transforming power, beyond what we have had experience of in
   other ways and duties. "We shall be changed into the same likeness."

   Well, then, we abide with Christ in the acts of our mind, by immediate
   thoughtfulness and contemplation upon Christ in the night, and upon our
   beds, and in our walkings, and by the wayside, and in times we set
   apart for meditation. We are greatly to labour after an intuitive view
   of Christ; that is, a direct view in the contemplation of Christ.

   Secondly. If you will abide with Christ, there must be an acting of
   your will in it also; and that is, in great diligence and carefulness
   about that obedience which Christ doth require, in all the instances of
   it. This is a great way of abiding with Christ, when we labour to have
   our wills in a readiness unto all the instances of obedience that
   Christ requireth at our hands. Let that be the question, whether it be
   the will of God that we should do thus, or not? And if it be so, pray
   let us be ready to show we do abide with Christ, by yielding cheerful
   and willing obedience to him in this instance and duty which he calleth
   us unto; and so in all other things. I would have every one of us think
   often of this matter, -- what it is Christ requires of me personally,
   in a way of duty and obedience. And I would have us labour to have in
   great readiness all things which Christ requires of us. And especially,
   brethren, I would have this in a readiness, that Christ requires of me
   to walk very circumspectly and carefully, -- to keep myself from spots
   and pollution, and defilements, by converse in the world. This Christ
   requires at all times, in all instances, and upon all occasions. What
   have we been preaching? what have former teachers been instructing us
   in? All that you are taught is, that you should come to the knowledge
   of all instances of duty, and the way of them, which Christ requires at
   your hands. And "if ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them."

   This is your fruit-bearing, -- a direct contemplation upon Christ;
   wherein I would beg that both you and my own soul might be found more
   to abound, while we are in this world (and you will find Christ, in the
   discharge of this duty, will make very near approaches and frequent
   visits to your hearts, -- more in the discharge of this duty than of
   any other); and to have our hearts in a readiness to comply with every
   instance of obedience Christ requires at our hands.

   Thirdly. There is an abiding with Christ in point of affection. There
   may be love and delight in all these things; if there be not, very
   spiritual contemplations will be a bar. There is no duty that is
   required of any man in this world so spiritual, so heavenly, so
   evangelical, but, through want of love and delight, a man may be
   slothful in performing of it. I may tie myself to do so this hour or
   that hour, and have no benefit to my own soul, nor give any glory unto
   God, if there be not love and delight in it. They will sweeten the
   duty, and refresh the heart of God and man, Christ and us. So labour,
   brethren, and pray greatly for it, that you may abide with Christ with
   delight, that you may find a sweetness and refreshment in it, and that
   every season of retiring unto Christ may bring a kind of spiritual joy
   and gladness to your hearts. Now you have a great opportunity, having
   shaken off the occasions of life and other concernments, to dwell with
   Christ; -- now it is a good time.

Discourse VII. [7]

   Question. When our own faith is weakened as to the hearing of our
   prayers -- when we ourselves are hindered within ourselves from
   believing the answer of our prayers, have no ground to expect we should
   be heard, or no ground to believe we are heard -- what are those things
   that greatly weaken our faith as to the answer of our prayers; that
   though we continue to pray, yet our faith is weakened as to the hearing
   of our prayers? and what are the grounds that weaken men's faith in
   such a state?

   Answer. If our hearts are not duly prepared to the consideration of the
   great and glorious properties, presence, and holiness of God, and duly
   affected with them in our preparation for prayer, it is certain we can
   have no faith for the hearing of our prayers.

   It is also of great importance that we consider aright in what state
   the things we seek for are promised; -- whether temporal things, that
   are left to God; or spiritual, that lie under a promise, and so we may
   press God immediately about them.

   There are two things that are certainly great weakeners of our faith as
   to God's hearing our prayers:--

   First. The one is, that intermixture of self which is apt to creep into
   our prayers, in public especially, in the congregation and assemblies.
   Self-reputation in the exercise of gifts, or whatever it be, weakens
   our faith as to the expectation of God's hearing our prayers.

   Secondly. The other is, that we pray with earnestness and fervency,
   with noise and clamour of speech, but do not industriously pursue the
   things we pray for. Unless we watch and follow after these things, we
   shall not have ground of faith for the hearing of our prayers; -- as,
   for instance, when the soul is burdened with a corruption, there is
   nothing we are more fervent in prayer unto God against; yet, when we
   have done this, we take no more care to get it mortified. Where is our
   faith that our prayers may be heard in this thing? We must pursue our
   prayers, or it will weaken our faith as to the hearing of them. We all
   pray; but do we believe that God will hear and answer our prayers?

   I shall not speak unto the nature of that faith we exercise, or what
   assurance we may have of God's hearing our prayers; but I will tell you
   plainly what hinders in us the answer of our prayers:--

   1. We are not clear that our persons are accepted. God had respect unto
   Abel and his offering, and not unto Cain and his offering. We can have
   no more faith that our prayers are heard than we have faith that our
   persons are accepted. How many of us are dubious, and know not whether
   we believe or no! or are the children of God or no! According as our
   faith is as to the acceptance of our persons, so, ordinarily, our faith
   will be as to the hearing of our prayers. I do acknowledge that
   sometimes, under extraordinary darkness or temptation, whilst a person
   doth not at all know nor hath any assurance what is his own condition,
   -- whether approved or rejected of God, -- yet the Holy Spirit of God
   many times gives assurance of the hearing of that prayer which is
   poured out in the anguish of the soul. But let us bring things unto a
   good issue between God and our souls, and not complain that our prayers
   are not heard, when we are negligent to come unto the assurance of
   faith about the acceptance of our persons. We have had many days of
   prayer, and have not seen that return of our prayer that we designed.
   This evil lies at the bottom, -- that we have been dubious as to our
   state of acceptance with God. Let us labour to amend it.

   2. Another thing is this, -- pray while you will, you will not believe
   your prayers are answered if you indulge any private lust, or do not
   vigorously endeavour the mortification of it, according to what the
   Scripture and duty require. If any lust ariseth in the soul, and we do
   not immediately engage to mortify it, as God requires, it will break
   out, and weaken our faith in all our prayers. Therefore, if you will be
   helped to believe the answer of your prayers, labour to search your
   hearts. Do not think that no corruption is indulged but such as break
   out into open sin. It may be you do not know the corruption you
   indulge; labour, therefore, to find it out, and you will find how your
   faith is weakened thereby.

   3. Again; want of having treasured up former experiences of the hearing
   of prayer. We have not provided as we ought in this matter. If we had
   laid up manifold experiences of God's having heard our prayers, it
   would strengthen our faith that God doth hear them. It may be some have
   prayed all their days; God hath kept their souls alive, that they have
   not wickedly departed from God, and they have obtained particular
   mercies; -- why, such ought to keep a constant record of God's hearing
   their prayers. Every discovery made of Christ that draws our souls more
   to love him, and engageth us to cleave unto him, is our experience of
   God's hearing our prayers.

   4. I might add, when we ourselves are not sensible that we arise unto
   that fervency of prayer that is required of them that believe. If we
   pray in the congregation, in our closets, or families, and when we have
   done, are not sensible that we have risen up unto that fervency that is
   required, we cannot believe our prayers are answered.

   It is the duty of all men to pray unto the Lord; but it is incumbent on
   none more than those who have really and sincerely given up themselves
   unto God, and yet in truth have no comfortable persuasion concerning
   their condition. That is a state wherein I am so far from discouraging
   prayer, that it is your season for prayer in the whole course of your
   lives. When Paul was first called, before such time as he had evidence
   of the pardon of his sins, it is said, "Behold, he prays." If they
   truly attend unto their state and condition, they may be sure to be the
   persons of whom also it will be said, "Behold, they pray." And even in
   these prayers they may exercise faith, when they have not faith to
   believe that their prayers are heard. But while in this condition, it
   will be hard to believe that their prayers are heard, when they cannot
   believe that their persons are accepted.

Discourse VIII.

   Question. When may any one sin, lust, or corruption, be esteemed
   habitually prevalent?

   Answer. I shall premise some few things before I come to answer the
   question:--

   First. All lusts and corruptions whatsoever have their root and
   residence in our nature, -- the worst of them. For, saith the apostle
   James, chap. i. 14, "Every man is tempted of his own lust." Every man
   hath his own lust, and every man hath all lust in him; for this lust,
   or corruption, is the depravation of our nature, and it is in all men.
   And in the root and principle of it, it is in all men even after their
   conversion. So saith the apostle concerning believers, Gal. v. 17, "The
   flesh lusteth against the Spirit; so that ye" (believers) "cannot do
   the things that ye would." What doth the flesh lust unto? Why, it lusts
   unto the works of it. What are they? "Adultery, fornication,
   uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance,
   emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders,
   drunkenness, revellings, and such like." The flesh lusteth unto all
   these things in believers, -- the worst things that can be mentioned;
   whence is that [saying] of our Saviour, which yields to me a doctrine
   which is a sad truth, but so plain that nothing can be more. He
   foretells marvellous troubles, great desolations and destructions, that
   shall come upon the world, and befall all sorts of men, and says, "It
   is a day that as a snare shall come on all them that dwell on the face
   of the whole earth.'?" Nothing makes me more believe that day, that
   terrible day of the Lord, is coming upon the face of the whole earth,
   than this, that it comes "as a snare." "Men do not take notice of it;
   do you, therefore, take heed to yourselves, you that are my disciples:
   believers, take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
   overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and the cares of this
   life, and so that day come upon you at unawares.'?" The doctrine I
   observe from thence is this, -- that the best of men have need to be
   warned to take care of the worst of sins in the approach of the worst
   of times. Who would think, when such troubles, distresses, desolations,
   were coming upon a nation, in that place the disciples of Christ should
   be in danger of being overtaken with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and
   the cares of this life? Yet he who is the wisdom of God, knew how it
   would be with us. Nay, what if a man should say, from observation, that
   professors are never more in danger of sensual, provoking sins, than
   when destruction is lying nearest at the door? "In that day," saith he,
   "take care."

   Secondly. Another thing I would premise is this, -- that this root of
   sin abiding in us, as I have showed, will, upon its advantage, work
   unto all sorts of evils; -- which should give us a godly jealousy over
   our souls, and over one another. Saith the apostle, Rom. vii. 8, "Sin
   wrought in me all manner of concupiscence."

   Thirdly. If it be so, that sin doth thus always abide in us, and will
   upon occasions work to all its fruit, to all manner of concupiscence,
   then the mortification of sin is a continual duty, that we ought to be
   exercised in all our days. Col. iii. 3, "Ye are dead, and your life is
   hid with Christ in God." A blessed state and condition! I desire no
   better attainment in this world than this holds out. But what duty does
   the apostle infer from thence? "Therefore," saith he, "mortify your
   members which are upon the earth." What, I pray? "Fornication,
   uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and
   covetousness, which is idolatry." The mortification of sin is a duty
   incumbent upon the best of saints.

   Fourthly. The fourth thing I would premise is this, -- that a
   particular sin doth not obtain a signal prevalency without it hath some
   signal advantage; for our corrupt nature is universally and equally
   corrupt; but a particular sin obtains prevalency by particular
   advantages.

   It would be too long to speak of all those advantages. I shall name
   two, whereunto others may be reduced:--

   1. The inclination of constitution gives particular advantages unto
   particular sins. Some may be very much inclined to envy; some to wrath
   and passion; and others to sensual sins, -- gluttony, drunkenness,
   uncleanness, -- to name the things which our Saviour names, and warns
   us of. It is with respect hereunto that David said he "would keep
   himself from his iniquity," as some think. I have only this to say, --
   that it hath been much from the fallacy of the devil that men have been
   apt to plead constitution and the inclination of their constitution to
   the extenuation of their sin; when, indeed, it is an aggravation. "I am
   apt to be passionate in my nature," saith one; "I am sanguine," saith
   another, "and love company." They make their natural inclinations to be
   a cover and excuse for their sin. But this I must say, as my judgment,
   -- that if grace does not cure constitution-sins, it hath cured none;
   and that we can have no trial of the efficacy of grace, if we have it
   not in curing constitution-sins. The great promise is, that it shall
   change the nature of the wolf and the lion, of the bear, the asp, the
   cockatrice, and that they shall become as lambs; which it can never do,
   if it doth not change it by an habitual counterworking of inclinations
   arising from constitution. If grace, being habitual, doth not change
   the very inclination of constitution, I know not what it doth. That is
   the first advantage whereby particular sins come to have signal
   advantage and prevalency.

   2. Outward occasions; and I refer them unto two heads:--

   (1.) To education. Particular sins get advantage by education. If we do
   even in education instruct our children to pride, by their fineries and
   deportment to themselves, -- if we teach them to be proud, we heap dry
   fuel upon them, till such time as lust will flame. Let us take heed of
   this. It is an easy thing to bring forth a proud generation by such
   means.

   (2.) Society in the world, according to occasion of life, is that which
   inflames particular corruptions. According as men delight in their
   converse, so corruption will be provoked and heightened by it.

   I have spoke all these things previously, to show you where lies the
   nature and principle of the danger we are going to inquire into, and
   how it comes to that condition.

   Now, I shall inquire a little into the question itself, -- how we may
   know whether a particular corruption be habitually predominant or no?

   Brethren, I take it for granted the vilest of those lusts which our
   Saviour and his apostles warn us against, to mortify and crucify, may
   be working in the hearts and minds of the best of us; and that a
   particular lust may be habitually prevalent, where, for particular
   reasons, it never brings forth outward effects: therefore, look to
   yourselves. I say, then, when the mind and soul is frequently and
   greatly, as there are occasions, urged upon and pressed with a
   particular lust and corruption, this doth not prove that particular
   lust and corruption to be habitually prevalent; for it may be a
   temptation. This may all proceed from the conjunction of temptation
   with indwelling sin; which will make it fight and war, and use force,
   and lead captive.

   But suppose a person be in that condition, how shall he know whether it
   be a temptation in conjunction with indwelling sin in general, or
   whether it be an habitual prevalency of a particular corruption?

   I answer, --

   I. It is not from the prevalency of corruption these three ways:--

   1. If the soul be more grieved with it than defiled by it, it is a
   temptation, and not a lust habitually prevalent. In this case, when a
   heart is so solicited with any sin, sin and grace are both at work, and
   have their contrary aims. The aim of grace is to humble the soul; and
   the aim of sin, to defile it. And the soul is so far defiled as, by the
   deceitfulness and solicitations of sin, consent is obtained. Defilement
   ariseth not from temptation as active upon the mind, but from
   temptation as admitted with consent: so far as it consents, whether by
   surprisal or long solicitations, so far it is defiled. It is otherwise
   if the soul be more grieved with it than defiled by it.

   2. It is so, when the soul can truly, and doth, look upon that
   particular corruption as its greatest and most mortal enemy. "It is not
   soldiers who have ruined my estate, nor a disease that hath taken away
   my health, nor enemies who have ruined my name or opposed me; but this
   corruption, which is my great and mortal enemy." When the soul is truly
   under this apprehension, then it is to be hoped it is the power of
   temptation, and not the prevalency of lust or corruption.

   3. It is so, also, when a man maintains his warfare and his conflict
   with it constantly, especially in those two great duties of private
   prayer and meditation; which if once the soul be beat off from, it is
   driven out of the field, and sin is conqueror. But so long as a man
   maintains the conflict in the exercise of grace in those duties, I look
   upon it as a temptation, and not an habitual, prevalent lust.

   II. I shall now proceed to show when a corruption is habitually
   prevalent.

   And here is a large field before me, but I shall only speak some few
   things:--

   1. When a man doth choose, or willingly embrace, known occasions of his
   sin, that sin is habitually prevalent. There is no man that hath the
   common understanding of a Christian, and hath any corruption or lust
   working in him, but he knows what are the occasions that provoke it. No
   man, unless he is profligately wicked, can choose sin for sin's sake;
   but he who knows what are the occasions that stir up, excite, and draw
   forth, any particular corruption, and doth choose them, or willingly
   embrace them, there is the habitual prevalency of sin to a high degree
   in the mind of that man, whosoever he be: for sin is to be rejected in
   the occasion of it, or it will never be refused in the power of it.

   2. Let a man fear it is so, when he finds arguments against it to lose
   their force. No man is under the power of particular corruption, but
   will have arguments suggested to his mind from fear, danger, shame,
   ruin, against continuing under that corruption. When a man begins to
   find these arguments abate in their force, and have not that prevalency
   upon his mind they have had, let him fear there is an habitual,
   prevalency of his corruption.

   3. When a man, upon conviction, is turned out of his course, but is not
   turned aside from his design, -- when he traverseth his way like the
   wild ass, "In her occasion who shall turn her aside?" -- if you meet
   her, or pursue her, you may turn her out of her way; but still she
   pursues her design. Men meet with strong convictions of sin, strong
   rebukes and reproofs; this a little puts them out of their way, but not
   from their design or inclination; the bent of their spirit lies that
   way still; and the secret language of their heart is, "that it were
   free with me to be as in former days!" Certainly a corruption is
   habitually prevalent, if it seldom or never fails to act itself under
   opportunities and temptations. If a man who trades cheats every time he
   is able to do so, he hath covetousness in his heart; or if a man
   whenever opportunity and occasion meet together to drink, doth it to
   excess, -- this is a sign of an habitual corruption, if he be not able
   to hold out scarce at any time against a concurrence of temptation and
   opportunity.

   4. When the soul, if it will examine itself, will find it is gone from
   under the conduct of renewing grace, and is, at the best, but under the
   evidence [influence?] of restraining grace. Believers are under the
   conduct of renewing grace; and I grant that sometimes, when, under the
   power of corruption and temptation, even they have broken the rule of
   renewing grace, God will keep them in order by restraining grace, -- by
   fear of danger, shame, and infamy, -- by outward considerations set
   home upon the mind by the Spirit of God, which keeps them off from sin:
   but this is but sometimes. But, if a man finds his heart wholly got
   from under the rule of renewing grace, and that he hath no leading or
   conduct but restraining grace, his sin hath got the perfect victory
   over him; that is, he would sin on to the end of his life, were it not
   for fear of shame, danger, death, and hell; he is no longer acted by
   renewing grace, which is faith and love, -- faith working by love. A
   man who hath a spiritual understanding may examine himself, and find
   under what conduct he is.

   5. Lastly, when there is a predominant will in sinning, then lust is
   habitually prevalent. Sin may entangle the mind and disorder the
   affections, and yet not be prevalent; but when it hath laid hold upon
   the will, it hath the mastery.
     __________________________________________________________________

Discourse IX. [8]

   Question. Whether lust or corruption, habitually prevalent, be
   consistent with the truth of grace?

   Answer. This is a hard question; there are difficulties in it, and, it
   may be, it is not precisely to be determined. I am sure we should be
   wonderfully careful what we say upon such a question, which determines
   the present and eternal condition of the souls of men.

   Supposing we retain something of what was spoken in stating a lust or
   corruption so habitually prevalent, because this is the foundation of
   our present inquiry, I shall bring what I have to say upon this
   question to a few heads, that they may be remembered.

   I say, then, --

   First. It is the duty of every believer to take care that this may
   never be his own case practically. We shall meet with straits enough,
   and fears enough, and doubts enough about our eternal condition, though
   we have no lust nor corruption habitually prevalent; therefore, I say,
   it is the duty of every believer to take care this may never be his
   case. David did so, Ps. xix. 12, 13, "Who can understand his errors?"
   saith he, "Cleanse thou me from secret faults. Keep back thy servant
   also from presumptuous sins: then shall I be upright, and I shall be
   innocent from the great transgression." He acknowledges his errors and
   sins, and prays for cleansing, purifying, pardon; but for presumptuous
   sins, sins with a high hand, and every habitual corruption, which hath
   something of presumption, -- "Lord, keep back thy servant from them,"
   saith he. The apostle's caution is to the same purpose, Heb. xii. 15,
   "Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any
   root of bitterness spring up." There is the root of bitterness in every
   one; which I look upon as a corruption in some measure habitual, if it
   springs up unto great defilement. And I beseech you, brethren, beg of
   God, for your own souls and mine, that we may be careful this be never
   our case.

   Secondly. The second thing I would observe is this, -- whatever may be
   said concerning its consistency with grace, it is certainly consistent
   with peace. I wish we could remember what description was given before
   of this prevalent corruption, that we might consider the things now
   applied unto it. Here (though I would be as tender as of the apple of
   mine eye in these things) I will not fear to say this, that the peace
   which any one hath concurring with a prevalent corruption, is security,
   not peace. I know men may be at great peace under prevalent
   corruptions, and live upon good hopes that they shall be accepted with
   God, -- that it shall be well with them in the latter end; and that
   they shall have power one time or other against this corruption, and
   will leave it when it is seasonable, and strive against it more than
   they have done: but all such peace is but security. Under prevalent
   corruption there is a drawing back; for I would state the matter
   thus:-- a person who is a professor, and hath kept up to duties and
   obedience till some lust hath gotten strength, by constitution,
   temptations, or occasions of life, and hath drawn him off from his
   former renovation in walking with God; there is then a drawing back.
   Now, saith the apostle, "If any man draw back, my soul shall have no
   pleasure in him," Heb. x. 38. And when God hath no pleasure according
   to the several degrees of backsliders (it may be that is meant of final
   apostasy), he doth not intimate any thing that is a ground of peace to
   that soul. So Isa. lvii. 17, "For the iniquity of his covetousness was
   I wroth, and hid myself from him." If there be an incurable iniquity of
   covetousness, or any other iniquity, whether manifest unto us or no,
   God is angry, and doth hide himself from us. I pray, brethren, let us
   examine our peace; and if we find we have a peace that can maintain its
   ground and station under prevalent corruption, trust no more to that
   peace, -- it will not stand us in stead when it comes to a trial.

   Thirdly. The third thing I would say is this, -- that if a prevalent
   corruption be not inconsistent with the truth of grace, it is certainly
   inconsistent with the true exercise of grace. It is not, indeed,
   inconsistent with the performance of duties; but it is inconsistent
   with the true exercise of grace in the performance of duties. It is
   often seen and known, that persons under prevalent corruption will
   multiply duties, thereby to quiet conscience, and to compensate God for
   what they have done amiss. Persons may multiply prayers, follow
   preaching, and attend to other duties, when they use all these things,
   through the deceitfulness of sin, but as a cloak unto some prevailing
   corruption; but in all those duties there is no true exercise of grace.

   The true determination of this question depends upon a right exposition
   of 1 John ii. 15. If we could understand that verse, it determines this
   point, "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.
   If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him." There
   is the question, whether prevalent corruption be inconsistent with true
   grace? I know the words may have this construction, "If any man do make
   the world his chiefest good, if any man put the world in the place of
   God, then the love of the Father is not in him; he hath either received
   no love from God, or he hath no love to God as a Father in Christ." But
   indeed the apostle, speaking unto believers, I am apt to think speaks
   not of the whole kind, but degrees, -- if there be a prevalency of love
   of the world, there is no prevalency of the actings of the love of the
   Father, -- that they do not concern the habitual principles of the love
   of the world, and of the love of the Father, but the prevailing actings
   of the one and the other. And, accordingly, it may be said of all other
   graces whatsoever, that where there is a prevalency of the acting of
   sin, there is a suspension of the exercise of grace. Brethren, if any
   of us have been under the power of prevalent corruption (I will be
   still tender, and speak what ought to be received and believed, whether
   people do or not), it is much to be feared we have lost all our prayers
   and hearing, because we have not had a true exercise of grace in them.
   Some exercise there may be, but a due and true exercise of grace will
   be laid asleep by prevalent corruption. And therefore let us take heed
   of prevalent corruption, as we would take heed of losing all things
   that we have wrought, -- our praying, hearing, suffering, charity,--
   for want of a due exercise of grace in them.

   Fourthly. I shall grant this, that spiritual life may be in a swoon,
   when the spiritual man is not dead. There is a kind of deliquium of the
   spirits, called swooning away, that may befall believers, which
   suspends all acts of life, when yet the man is not dead. So I say,
   though I should see a man, through the prevalency of corruption, have
   all the evidences of a spiritual life cast into a swoon, yet I will not
   presently conclude the spiritual man is dead. Take the case of David,
   from the time of his great fall and transgression in the matter of
   Uriah until the coming of Nathan the prophet. Persons are generally
   inclined to believe that the spiritual life was in a swoon, when the
   spiritual man was not dead. His fall, as an honest man said, beat the
   breath out of his body, and he lay a long time like a man dead, by
   reason of that power, which one signal sin left in his soul. And take
   that as a great instance that one sin, not immediately taken off by
   great humiliation, leaves great and even habitual inclinations in the
   soul to the same sin. So that some ascribed it unto the corruption of
   our nature. For it is a great and difficult question in divinity, how
   one particular sin, as the sin of Adam was, should bring in habitual
   corruption to our nature. To which some answer thus: That any one
   single moral act, performed with a high hand, hath great obliquity in
   it, disposing our whole nature to corruption. David, by that single act
   of flagrant wickedness, did continue in it for so long a space of time,
   till Nathan came and administered some good spirits to him, that
   relieved him out of his swoon. Wherefore I say that I will not judge a
   person to be spiritually dead, whom I have judged formerly to have had
   spiritual life, though I see him at present in a swoon as to all
   evidences of the spiritual life. And the reason why I will not judge so
   is this, -- because if you judge a person dead, you neglect him, you
   leave him; but if you judge him in a swoon, though never so dangerous,
   you use all means for the retrieving of his life. So ought we to do to
   one another and our own souls.

   Fifthly. There is a prevalency of sin that is inconsistent with true
   grace, which may befall those who have been professors. So the apostle
   doth plainly declare, Rom. vi. 16, "Know ye not, that to whom ye yield
   yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey;
   whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?" There
   is such a serving of sin as puts a man into a contrary state.

   Sixthly. I shall add but one thing more, and that is this, -- there may
   be a corruption, sin, or lust, habitually prevalent, as to whatsoever
   evidences the person in whom it is or others can discern; and yet the
   root of the matter, the root of spiritual life, be notwithstanding in
   the person.

   Suppose, then, there be such a prevalency, that the soul judges to be
   habitual, how shall we know whether the root of the matter be in such a
   person or no?

   If the soul hath any thing left of spiritual life, there will be
   something of vital operations in that soul. Now, the vital operations
   that give evidence the soul is not absolutely slain by prevalent
   corruption, are opposition and humiliation. So long as the soul, though
   it be never so much captivated, is conscious to itself of a sincerity
   in the opposition it makes, there is an evidence of a vital operation;
   as likewise where it is constant in its humiliation on that account.

   But if it be farther inquired, how it may be known that this
   humiliation is sincere?

   I answer, It cannot be known from its vigour and efficacy; for that
   overthrows the question. For if the opposition was vigorous and
   effectual, it would break the power of lust and corruption, so that it
   would be no more prevalent. But two ways it may be known.

   1. By its constancy. If the root of the matter be still in us, there
   will be a constant opposition to every act of any prevailing corruption
   whatsoever. I do not speak about violent temptations, but ordinary
   cases; in which I know not whence we should conclude the root of the
   matter is in that man who doth not make a sincere opposition to every
   instance of the acting of prevalent corruption. If a man can pass over
   one and another instance of prevalent corruption without any
   humiliation for it, the holy, sovereign God show him grace and mercy!
   but it is to me "the way of a serpent upon a stone," -- I see it not, I
   know it not.

   2. It is sincere, if it be from its proper spring; that is, if the
   opposition be not from conviction, light, or conscience only, but from
   the will of the poor sinner. "I would do otherwise; I would have this
   sin destroyed, -- I would have it rooted out, that it should be no more
   in me; my will lies against it, however it hath captivated my
   affections and disturbed my course."

   This is all I dare say upon this question, -- that there may be an
   habitual prevalency of corruption, which may seem so to them in whom it
   is, as also to those who converse with them, and yet the root of the
   matter be in them. We may know the root of the matter by the acting of
   spiritual life, -- in opposition going before, and humiliation coming
   after. We may know the sincerity of these vital actings by their
   constancy, and by their spring, -- if we are constant in them, and if
   they arise from our wills.

Discourse X. [9]

   Question. What shall a person do who finds himself under the power of a
   prevailing corruption, sin, or temptation?

   Answer. I shall premise only this one thing, and then inquire whether
   it belongs to us or no:--

   This prevalency hath many degrees. It may be a prevalency to outward
   scandal, or to the utter loss of inward peace, or to the disquieting
   and divesting of us of that tranquillity of mind usually which Christ
   calleth us unto. Now, pray consider that I speak to it equally and in
   every degree. And perhaps there may be none of us but, at one time or
   other, after inquiry, will have had experience in one degree or other,
   either to disquietment, loss of peace, or scandal.

   What shall such a person then do, who finds it so with him?

   I answer, --

   First. He should labour to affect his mind with the danger of it. It is
   not conceivable how subtle sin is to shift off an apprehension of the
   danger of it. "Notwithstanding this," says the man, "yet I hope I am in
   a state of grace, and shall be saved, and come to the issue of it at
   one time or other;" and so the mind keeps off a due sense of the danger
   of it. I beseech you, brethren and sisters, if this be your condition,
   labour to affect your minds that this state, as far as I know, will end
   in hell; and let not your minds be relieved from the apprehension that,
   upon due and good grounds of faith, these ways go down to the chambers
   of death. Do not please yourselves, imagining you are members of the
   church, and have good hopes of salvation by Jesus Christ; but consider
   whither this tends, and affect your minds with it.

   Secondly. When the person is affected with the danger of it, the next
   thing to be done is, to burden his conscience with the guilt of it. For
   the truth is, as our minds are, upon many pretences, slow to apprehend
   the danger of sin; so our consciences are very unwilling to take the
   weight of the burden of it as to its guilt. I speak not of men of
   seared consciences, that, lay what weight you will upon them, will feel
   none; but even of the consciences of renewed men, unless they use all
   the ways and means whereby conscience may be burdened, -- as by
   apprehensions of the holiness of God, of the law, of the love of
   Christ, and of all those things whereby conscience must be made to feel
   the weight of its guilt. No sooner doth it begin to be made a little
   sick with a sense of the guilt of sin, but it takes a cordial
   presently. "Here this sin hath taken place, it hath contracted this and
   that guilt; I have been thus long negligent in this or that duty; I
   have thus long engaged in this and that folly, and been so given up
   unto the world: I must take to Christ by faith, or I am undone." It is
   afraid of making its load. But let conscience bear the burden, and not
   easily shift it off, unless it can, by true faith, guided by the word,
   load it upon Christ; which is not a thing of course to be done.

   Thirdly. "What shall we do in case we have this apprehension of its
   danger, and can be thus burdened with its guilt?" Pray for deliverance.
   "How?" you will say. There is in the Scriptures mention of "roaring,"
   Ps. xxxii. 3, "The voice of my roaring;" and likewise of "shouting,"
   Lam. iii. 8, "I shouted and cried." This is a time to pray that God
   would not hide his face from our roaring, nor shut out our prayers when
   we shout unto him; that is, to cry out with all the vigour of our
   souls. Christ is able "to succour" and help them that "make an outcry"
   to him. The word signifies so; [10] and our word "succour," signifies a
   running in to help a man who is ready to be destroyed. These may seem
   hard things to us, but it is a great thing to save our souls, and to
   deliver ourselves from the snares of Satan.

   Fourthly. Treasure up every warning, and every word that you are
   convinced was pointed against your particular corruption. There is none
   of you who may have the power of particular corruptions, but God, at
   one time or other, in his providence or word, gives particular warning,
   that the soul may say, "This is for me, I must comply with it;" but "it
   is like a man that sees his face in a glass, and goes away, and
   immediately forgets what manner of man he was," -- there is an end of
   it. But if God give you such warnings, set them down, treasure them up,
   lose them not; they must be accounted for. "He that, being often
   reproved, hardens his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that
   without remedy."

   Fifthly. I shall mind you of two rules, and so have done:--

   1. In your perplexities as to the power of sin, exercise faith, that,
   notwithstanding all you see and find that you are almost lost and gone,
   there is a power in God, through Christ, for the subduing and
   conquering of it.

   2. It is in vain for any to think to mortify a prevailing sin, who doth
   not at the same time endeavour to mortify all sin, and to be found in
   every duty. Here is a person troubled and perplexed with a temptation
   or corruption; both are the same in this case: he cries, "O that I were
   delivered! I had rather have deliverance than life! I will do my
   endeavour to watch against it." But it may be this person will not come
   up to a constancy in secret prayer; -- he will go up and down, and wish
   himself free, but will not be brought up to such duties [as] wherein
   those lusts must be mortified. Therefore, take this rule along with
   you, -- never hope to mortify any corruption whereby your hearts are
   grieved, unless you labour to mortify every corruption by which the
   Spirit of God is grieved; and be found in every duty, especially those
   under which grace thrives and flourishes.

Discourse XI.

   Question. What is our duty with respect to dark and difficult
   dispensations of God's providence in the world?

   Answer. In answer unto this question, three things are to be
   considered:-- First. What are, in a Scripture sense, those things that
   make a season of providence dark and difficult? Secondly. What are the
   open signs of the coming and passing of such a season over us? And,
   Thirdly. What are our special duties in reference to our entering into,
   and passing through, such a season?

   First. What are those things that make a season of providence dark and
   difficult?

   I find four things in Scripture that make a dark season of providence;
   and, if I mistake not, they are all upon us:--

   1. The long-continued prosperity of wicked men. This you are sensible
   is the most known case of all the Old Testament, Ps. lxxiii.; Jer. xii.
   1-3; Hab. i. 4, 13, and many other places. The holy men of old did
   confess themselves in great perplexity at the long-continued prosperity
   of wicked men, and their long-continued prosperity in ways of
   wickedness. Give but this one farther circumstance to it, -- the
   long-continued prosperity of wicked men in their wickedness, when the
   light shines round about them to convince them of that wickedness, and
   God speaks in and by the light of his word against them; that is a
   trial. When all things were wrapped up in darkness and idolatry, it is
   no wonder at the patience of God; but when things come in any place to
   that state that many continue prosperous in wickedness when the day is
   upon them that judges them, -- it is a difficulty.

   2. It is a difficult season of providence, when the church is continued
   under persecution and distress in a time of prayer, when they give
   themselves to prayer. The difficulty seems mentioned, Ps. lxxx. 4, "O
   Lord, how long wilt thou smoke against the prayer of thy people?" This
   made it hard, that God should afflict his church, and keep her under
   distresses, and suffer the furrows to be made long upon her back, and
   continue her under oppression from one season to another. There may be
   evident reason for that. But saith God, "Call upon me in the time of
   trouble, and I will hear." God hath promised to hear the church: Will
   not God avenge the elect, that call upon him day and night? He will do
   it speedily. Now, when God seems to be angry with the prayers of his
   people, that is a difficult season: when they cry and shout, and God
   shuts out their prayers, that makes a dark providence.

   As the other difficulty is evidently upon us, so I hope we have this
   difficulty to conflict withal, that the anger of God continues to smoke
   against the prayers of his people, as having stirred up many a blessed
   cry to himself; for there is a time when he will hear and answer their
   prayers.

   3. It is a dark and difficult dispensation of providence, when the
   world and nations of the world are filled with confusion and blood, and
   no just reason appearing why it should be so. When our Saviour
   foretells a difficult season, Matt. xxiv. and Luke xxi., he says,
   "There shall be terrible times, such as never were; nation shall rise
   against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be wars,
   bloodshed, and earthquakes; and the very elect shall hardly escape."
   Therefore God calls such a time, "a day of darkness," yea, of "thick
   darkness," Joel ii. 2, a dark, gloomy day. There is nothing to be seen
   in all the confusions that are in the world at this day, but that the
   frogs or unclean spirits are gone forth to stir up the lusts of men to
   make havoc of one another.

   4. It adds greatly to the difficulty of a season, when we have no
   prospect whither things are tending, and what will be their issue.

   There are two ways whereby we may have a prospect of things that are in
   being:-- by the eye of God's providence, when we perceive which way
   that looks; and by Scripture rule. The truth is, we are in a time
   wherein no man can discern a fixed eye of providence looking this way
   or that way. What will be the issue of these things; whether it will be
   the deliverance of the church, or the desolation of the nation and
   straitening of the church; whether God will bring good out of them in
   this generation, or any other time, none knows: this makes it
   difficult. Ps. lxxiv. 9, We see not our signs, -- have no tokens what
   God intends to do; "neither is there among us any to tell us how long."

   There is none of these things but make a season difficult, and
   providence dark; but when all of them concur together, they cannot but
   greatly heighten it: and I think they are all upon us.

   Secondly. What are the open signs of the coming and passing of such a
   season over us?

   There are three tokens or outward evidences of a difficult season. It
   is so, --

   1. When God's patience is abused. You know that place, Eccles. viii.
   11, "Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
   therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do
   evil." Things pass thus:-- men fall into wickedness, great wickedness;
   their consciences fly in their faces, and they are afraid; the power of
   their lusts carries them into the same wickedness again, and their
   consciences begin to grow a little colder than they were: no evil comes
   of it, and judgment is not speedily executed; and so their hearts at
   last come to be wholly set to do evil. Hence others that look on say,
   "Here are men given up to all wickedness; surely judgment will speedily
   come upon these men." Judgment doth not come, -- God is patient; and so
   they themselves turn as wicked as the former. Abusing of God's patience
   is an evident sign of a dispensation of the displeasure of God in his
   providence: and if ever it was upon any, it is upon us; and men learn
   it more and more every day. Every one talks of other men's sins; and
   seeing no judgment falls upon them, they give up themselves to the same
   sins.

   2. It is so when God's warnings are despised: "When thine hand is
   lifted up, they will not see." That is a difficult season; for, saith
   God, "The fire of thine adversaries shall consume thee." Never had
   people more warnings than we have had; -- warning in heaven above, and
   warning on the earth beneath; warnings by lesser judgments, and
   warnings by greater; and warnings by the word. God's hand hath been
   lifted up; but who takes notice of it? Some despise it, and others talk
   of it as a tale to be told; and there is an end of it. Who sanctifies
   the name of God in all the warnings that are given us? "The Lord's
   voice crieth unto the city," Mic. vi. 9; but it is only "the man of
   wisdom," of substance, that seeth the name of God in these his cries
   unto the city by his warnings from heaven and earth, signs and tokens,
   and great intimations of his displeasure.

   3. An inclination in all sorts of people to security, and to take no
   notice of these things. I have spoken unto this business of security
   formerly, and I pray God warn you and myself of it; for I believe none
   of us are such strangers to our hearts, but we can say, that under all
   these warnings there is an inclination to security: if God did not
   prevent it, we should fall fast asleep under all the judgments that are
   round about us.

   Any of these things shows that we are under a difficult dispensation of
   providence; but where all concur, -- God be merciful to such a people!
   -- it is the opening of the door to let out judgments to the uttermost.

   Now if this be such a season, as I do verily believe we are all
   sensible it is, then, --

   Thirdly, What shall we do? what are our special duties in reference to
   our entering into, and passing through, such a season?

   I might speak unto the peculiar exercise of those graces which are
   required unto such a season; as faith, resignation to the will of God,
   readiness for his pleasure, waiting upon God, weanedness from the
   world, and the like; but I will only give you three or four duties,
   which are peculiarly hinted in such a season, and so have done:--

   1. Our first duty is, that we should meet together, and confer about
   these things, Mal. iii. 16, 17. A good plan in difficult seasons, such
   as some of us have seen. The day of the Lord was coming that would burn
   as an oven: "Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another:
   and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was
   written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon
   his name. And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day
   when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his
   own son that serveth him." When was this? In a time of great judgment,
   and great sin, -- "when they called the proud happy, and they that
   wrought wickedness were set up, and they that tempted God were even
   delivered;" that is, "appeared to be delivered." It is the great duty
   of us all, as we have opportunity and occasion, to confer about these
   things; about the causes of them, -- what ariseth from the profane,
   wicked world; what from a persecuting, idolatrous world; and (wherein
   we are more concerned) what from a professing generation; and see how
   we can sanctify the name of God in it. We might have as great
   advantages as any under the face of heaven for the discharge of this
   duty, if we did but make use of that "price" [Prov. xvii. 16] which God
   hath put into our hands; but if we are "fools," and have no "heart" to
   improve it, the blame will be our own. You have opportunities for
   meeting and assembling: I fear there are cold affections in your
   private meetings; I wish there be not. It may be some thrive and grow;
   I hope so: and others are cold and backward; it is not a season for it.
   If God would help us to manage this church aright, and as we ought to
   do, there can be no greater advantage under such a season than we
   enjoy: but we want voluntary inspection; and the Lord lay it not to our
   charge we have deferred it so long. Much want of love might have been
   prevented, many duties furthered, and many evils removed, if we had
   come up to the light God hath given to us. But we are at a loss; and
   God knows we suffer under it, for want of discharging our duty.

   That is the first thing, -- to speak often one to another; -- to
   sanctify the name of God by an humble, diligent inquiry into the causes
   of these dispensations, and preparation for these things.

   2. The second duty in such a season is, for every one of us privately
   to inquire of Jesus Christ, in prayer and supplication, "What shall be
   the end of these things?" You have a great instance of it, Dan. viii.
   13, 14, "Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto
   that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning
   the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both
   the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? And he said unto
   me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary
   be cleansed." I suppose there is something of the ministry of angels in
   it; for this saint inquires, but the answer is made to Daniel, "One
   saint said unto another saint;" -- "and he said unto me." But the
   speaking saint was Jesus Christ. There was the Holy One that spake,
   which he calls plmvny?, "a certain saint;" but the derivation of the
   word is, "One that revealeth secrets." [11] There was application made
   unto Jesus Christ, who is the revealer of secrets, to know how long.
   And you will find in the Scriptures, in difficult dispensations, that
   is very many times the request of the saints to God, "How long?" Dan.
   xii. 6, 8, "How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?" and, "O
   my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?" There is an humble
   application by faith and prayer unto Jesus Christ, to know the mind of
   God in these things, that will bring satisfaction in to our souls. Do
   not leave yourselves to wander in your own thoughts and imaginations.
   It is impossible but we shall be debating things, and giving a rational
   account of them; but all will not bring us satisfaction. But let us go
   to Jesus Christ, and say to him, "O Lord, how long?" And he will give
   in secret satisfaction to our souls.

   This is the second thing, -- frequently confer about these things; and
   press Jesus Christ to give your souls satisfaction as to these
   dispensations And then, --

   3. Another peculiar duty required in such a season is, to mourn for the
   sins that are in the world. That is recommended to us, Ezek. ix. When
   God had given commission unto the sword to slay both old and young, he
   spared only them that mourned for the abominations that were done in
   the land. We come short in our duty in that matter, -- in [not] being
   affected with the sins of the worst of men. God being dishonoured, the
   Spirit of God blasphemed, the name of God reproached in them, we ought
   to mourn for their abominations. We mourn for the sins among God's
   people; but we ought also to mourn for those abominations others are
   guilty of, -- for their idolatries, murders, bloodshed, uncleanness, --
   for all the abominations that the lands about us, as well as our own,
   are filled with. It is our duty, in such a season, to mourn for them,
   or we do not sanctify the name of God, and shall not be found prepared
   for those difficult dispensations of God's providence which are coming
   upon us.

   4. The fourth and last peculiar duty which I shall mention is, to hide
   ourselves. And how shall we do that? The storm is coming; get an ark,
   as Noah did when the flood was coming upon the world: which is stated
   for a precedent of all judgments in future times. There are two things
   required to provide an ark, -- fear and faith:--

   (1.) Fear: "By faith Noah, being moved with fear, prepared an ark." If
   he had not been moved with the fear of God's judgments, he would never
   have provided an ark. It is a real complaint; we are not moved enough
   with the fear of God's judgments. We talk of [as] dreadful things as
   can befall human nature, and expect them every day; but yet we are not
   moved with fear. "Yet were they not afraid," saith Jeremiah, "nor rent
   their garments." Nor do we do so. Habakkuk, upon the view of God's
   judgments, was in another frame, chap. iii. 16, "When I heard," saith
   he, "my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness
   entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in
   the day of trouble." This is the way to find rest in the day of God's
   judgments. We are afraid of being esteemed cowards for fearing God's
   judgments; and then, --

   (2.) We cannot well provide an ark for ourselves, unless we be guided
   by faith, as well as moved by fear. "By faith, Noah prepared an ark."
   How many things there are to encourage faith, you have heard; -- the
   name, the properties of God, and the accomplishment of the promise of
   God. By virtue of all those properties, encourage faith in providing an
   ark.

   But you will say, "We are yet at a loss what this providing of an ark
   and hiding of ourselves is. A prudent man foresees the evil, and hides
   himself.' God calls us to enter into the chamber of providence, and
   hide ourselves till the indignation be overpast. If we knew what this
   was, we should apply ourselves unto it." I will tell you what I think
   in one instance:-- give no quiet to your minds, until, by some renewed
   act of faith, you have a strong and clear impression of the promises of
   God upon your hearts, and of your interest in them. If it be but one
   promise, it will prove an ark. If, under all these seasons, moved with
   fear, acted by faith, we can but get a renewed sense and pledge of our
   interest in any one promise of God, we have an ark over us that will
   endure, whatever the storm be. Think of it, and if nothing else occur
   to you, apply your minds to it, that you may not wander up and down at
   uncertainties; but endeavour to have a renewed pledge of your interest
   in some special promise of God, that it belongs unto you, and it will
   be an ark in every time of trouble that shall befall you.

Discourse XII. [12]

   I did at two meetings inquire among ourselves what was required in the
   time of approaching judgments and calamities, that the world hath been,
   and is like to be, filled withal? And God was pleased to guide us to
   the discovery of the necessary exercise of many graces, and the
   necessary attendance unto many duties, for that end and purpose. And we
   did design to spend our time this day to beg that God would give us
   those graces, and stir them up by his Spirit unto a due exercise; and
   that he would help us unto such a performance of those duties, that
   when the Lord Christ shall come, by any holy dispensation of his
   providence, we may be found of him in peace. That was the especial
   occasion of allotting the present time unto this duty; no ways
   excluding the reasons, occasions, and matter of prayer, which at other
   times we attend to for ourselves, the church, and the nation.

   I would offer a few words that may stir us up unto this duty:--

   The Scripture doth everywhere, upon all such occasions, call expressly
   unto us for a special preparation, by the exercise of grace, in
   reformation and holiness: "Judgment must begin at the house of God;"
   and "what will be the end of them that obey not the gospel?" What,
   then, is our duty? Why, saith he, "Seeing that all these things shall
   be dissolved" (all this outward frame of things), "what manner of
   persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness?"
   Brethren, we ought at all times to attend unto "all holy conversation
   and godliness;" but saith the apostle, "The approach of judgment is a
   peculiar motive thereunto; -- seeing that all these things are to be
   dissolved.'?" It is true, seeing Christ hath died for us, washed us in
   his blood, and given his Holy Spirit unto us, "What manner of persons
   ought we to be?" But the great motives are not exclusive of occasional
   exercises, but give an addition unto them. "Take heed that ye be not
   overtaken with surfeiting and drunkenness," -- with any excess in the
   use of the creature. What if it be so? "Then that day will come upon
   you at unawares;" -- the day when all shall be dissolved, -- the day of
   judgment, -- the day of approaching calamities. "You ought at all times
   to take care of these things; but if your minds are not influenced in
   the consideration of the approach of that day, you are not my
   disciples.'?" I do not at all speak unto what preparations are
   required.

   I could also reflect on those places where God expresseth his great
   displeasure against such who did not labour for a peculiar preparation
   upon approaching calamities. Isa. xxii. 12-14, "?I called for mourning,
   and fasting, and girding with sackcloth,' and you betook yourselves
   unto feasting on all occasions." "Surely, saith the Lord, this iniquity
   shall not be purged from you till ye die." And it is reckoned among the
   sins of the most profligate persons, that when God's hand is lifted up
   and ready to strike, they will not see, so as to learn righteousness,
   Isa. xxvi. 11.

   Let us, therefore, beg for grace. Though God multiplieth warnings,
   makes appearances of mercy, and then writes death upon them, and
   entangles every thing in darkness, yet our work goes slowly on in
   preparation. Cry earnestly unto God for such supplies of his grace and
   Spirit that may effectually bring us unto him; that we may no longer
   abide in the frame wherein we are.

   There are three things, and no more, that I know of (others may be
   named, but they may be reduced unto these three heads), that are
   required of us in reference unto approaching judgments; and there is
   not one of them through which we can pass, or which we can perform in a
   due manner, comfortably unto ourselves, and unto the glory of God,
   without we have some singular and eminent preparation for it. And they
   are these:-- First. That we ourselves stand in the gap, to turn away
   the threatened judgments. Secondly. That we may be fit for deliverance,
   if it please the Lord graciously to give it unto us. Saith Christ,
   speaking of great calamities, "Lift up your heads; for your redemption
   draweth nigh." Thirdly. That we may cheerfully and comfortably go
   through the calamities, if they shall overtake us.

   These three are comprehensive of all the threats of approaching
   judgments and darkness that encompass us at this day. Now, there is not
   one of them that we can be any way fit for, unless our hearts and lives
   are brought into an extraordinary preparation, according as God calls
   and requires. I do not know whether we believe these things or no, but
   they will be shortly found to be true.

   First. Who dares among us to propose himself to stand in the gap, to
   divert judgments from the nation, otherwise than in a formal manner,
   who is not prepared by these things we have spoken of, and hath not
   some good and comfortable persuasion of his own personal interest in
   Christ, and hath not freed himself from those sins that have procured
   these judgments, and who lives not in a resignation of himself unto the
   will of God? who dares to do this? We shall provoke God, if we think to
   stand in the gap, and turn away judgments from the nation, when we see
   ourselves are concerned in procuring those judgments.

   Secondly. We cannot be meet for deliverance, unless we are thus
   prepared. I have heard a notion preached and spoken upon other
   occasions, -- which I confess I never liked, and the more I consider
   it, the more I dislike it; and that is, that God, in the deliverance of
   his people, works for his own name's sake, that he may have all the
   glory, -- that it shall be seen merely to be of grace: and therefore he
   will oftentimes deliver his people, when they are in an unreformed and
   unreforming condition, that he may shame them and humble them by his
   mercy and grace afterward. I know no rule of Scripture upon which this
   notion may be grounded, nor one instance or example whereby it may be
   made out.

   Here lies the truth of it, -- when there are two things concurring in
   the deliverance of the church, God will deliver them, notwithstanding
   all their sins and unworthiness, without any previous humiliation in
   themselves:-- first, When God hath fixed and limited a certain season
   in his word and promise for their deliverance; and, secondly, When,
   antecedent unto their deliverance, they want means for humiliation. God
   delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt when they were in a very
   bad condition, -- an ignorant, stubborn, faithless generation; but both
   these things were concurring:-- God was engaged, in point of his
   promise, that, at the end of four hundred and thirty years, he would
   visit and deliver them; and they were deprived of all ordinances of
   worship in Egypt: not a sacrifice could they offer while they were
   there; not a Sabbath, I believe, though it is not expressed in
   Scripture, could they observe; -- the way of worship and knowledge of
   God was taken from them. So, when God delivered the children of Israel
   out of Babylon, they were in no very good condition; but God was
   engaged in point of promise as to that time, that at the end of seventy
   years they should be delivered; and in Babylon they had no means for
   instruction or reformation, -- no temple, no sacrifice; -- these were
   denied. But whenever God doth afford unto persons all the means of
   grace for humiliation, reformation, and turning unto himself, -- it may
   be as good as ever they shall in this world, -- that God did ever
   deliver that people out of their distresses, when they refused to be
   reformed, humbled, or to turn unto him, neither instances of Scripture
   nor God's dealing with his church will make this good. Therefore it is
   vain for us to expect any thing of this nature. If, indeed, for so many
   years we had been thrown into a wilderness condition, and had no
   preaching, no assemblies, no administration of ordinances, no warnings
   or charges from God, we might have expected the Lord would have given
   us deliverance; but to us, who have had all these things, and yet will
   not make use of what we have now at present, we have no ground to
   expect any such thing. Therefore I confess, neither by rule, instance,
   or example, do I expect deliverance, until God come in to work a
   thorough change and reformation in our hearts and lives; which makes it
   very necessary to be preparing to meet God in the way of his judgments.

   Thirdly. The third thing that may lie before us is, how we may
   cheerfully go through the calamities which may overtake us. I will say
   no more unto that, because it is that which we did expressly insist
   upon in our former discourse. As to the best of us, who have been long
   in the ways of God, woeful will be our surprisal when the days of
   calamity come, if we have lived in negligence of complying with the
   calls and warnings of God that we have had, to bring ourselves unto a
   more even and better frame. We shall find our strength to fail us, and
   have our comforts to seek, and be left to inward darkness when outward
   darkness increaseth, and not know whither to cause our sorrows to go.

   These things, brethren, I thought fit to mention unto you, that, if it
   be the will of God, they may be of use to take us off from those false
   hopes and false expectations which we are wonderfully ready to feed
   ourselves withal in such a day as this is wherein we live. It is high
   time for us to be calling upon God for this end.

Discourse XIII.

   The prophet Daniel tells us, when he understood by books -- namely, the
   writings of the prophet Jeremiah -- that the time wherein the great
   contest between Babylon and the church was to have its issue was come
   to a point, "Then," saith he, "I set my face to seek the Lord with
   prayer and supplications, and fasting." And if you will read his
   prayer, you will find nothing of confidence, nothing of
   self-ascription; but a deep acknowledgment of sin: "We, our kings, our
   princes, our fathers" (our church), "have all sinned;" so as that "to
   us belong shame and confusion of face." And never had such shame and
   confusion of face befallen the church as would have befallen them, if
   they had been disappointed in that trial. But he adds, "Unto thee
   belong mercies and forgivenesses." There he issues the whole business,
   upon "mercy and forgiveness," though he knew by books that the time was
   come.

   Truly, brethren, we do not know by any Scripture revelation, as he did,
   that the time is come wherein the long contest and conflict between
   Babylon and the church will have its issue; but it looks like it in the
   book of providence, and so like it, that it is a plain duty we should
   give ourselves unto prayer and supplication, that it do not issue in
   shame and confusion of face; which belongeth unto us by reason of our
   sins. It is that contest which is now under consideration, and which
   seems to be coming to its issue, and all men are in expectation of it.
   It is the greatest, save one, that ever was; for the greatest contest
   that ever was in this world was between the person and the gospel of
   Christ on the one hand, and the devil and the pagan world on the other;
   and the next to that is the contest between Christ -- in his offices
   and grace, in his gospel and worship -- and Antichrist. And it is at
   this day upon its trial, in as signal an instance as ever it received.
   The question is, as to us and our posterity, Whether Christ or
   Antichrist? whether the worship of God or of idols? whether the
   effusion, and waiting for the effusion, of the Spirit of God in his
   worship, or all manner of superstitious impositions? This is the
   present contest; and, it may be, under heaven there never was a more
   signal instance of the issue of this contest than will be in these
   nations in these days; I do not say presently or speedily; but this,
   you all know, is our state.

   I mention it only to let you know that there is more than an ordinary
   earnestness and fervency of spirit and wrestling with God required of
   us at this day for the cause of Zion, the interest of Christ, and
   defeating of his adversaries. What way God will work we know not. If he
   be at work, he hath said, that when a flood was cast out of the mouth
   of the dragon, to swallow up the woman everywhere (and we have had a
   flood cast out of the mouth of the dragon to swallow up the whole
   interest of Christ in this nation), the earth lifted up herself and
   helped the woman, and turned aside the flood. Good old Eli's heart
   trembled for the ark of God. The interest of God and the truths of
   Christ are yet among us, but hardly beset by the Philistines; and
   whether they may not take them I know not, -- God only knows. But
   assuredly, brethren, our hearts ought now to tremble for the ark of
   God, that God would continue it among us, and not give his glory into
   the hands of the adversary.

   I have mentioned these things only for this end, -- that if God will,
   our hearts may be a little warmed, upon all occasions, in this great
   contest and conflict between Christ and Antichrist, to come in with our
   prayers to the help of the Lord, and of the ark of the Lord, -- that we
   may see a blessed issue of this trial, and not be covered with that
   shame and confusion of face which belong unto us.
     __________________________________________________________________

Discourse XIV. [13]

   This meeting is for conference, and I would ask you a few questions:--

   First. Whether do you think there are extraordinary calls and warnings
   of God towards this nation at this time?

   Secondly. If there be, what is the voice of these calls?

   Thirdly. Whether any sort of men, believers, or churches, are exempted
   from attending unto and complying with these calls of God? For there
   lies a reserve in our hearts. The nation is very wicked (I shall not
   repeat the sins of the nation), the warning is general to the nation,
   the body of the people, and God testifies his displeasure against them.
   Now, the inquiry is, Whether there be any rule that we, who profess
   ourselves believers, and a church, should count ourselves exempted from
   a particular compliance with these extraordinary calls of God, -- that
   they are for others, and not for us? "If the scourge slay suddenly, he
   will laugh at the trial of the innocent," Job ix. 23. And the good figs
   went first into captivity.

   Fourthly. What have we done hitherto in order to it, that may evidence
   itself to be an answer to, a compliance with, these calls of God, which
   we have owned here before the Lord? We have been speaking of it, and it
   becomes me to judge that we have had good and sincere desires after it.
   And neither the church, nor any one in the church, shall have any
   reflections from me beyond evidence. It becomes me to judge that we
   have had in ourselves good intentions, and sincere endeavours after it,
   though they have been, it may be, no way suitable or proportionable to
   the present occasion; and therefore I must say, that, in an eminent and
   extraordinary manner, as yet we have done nothing. We have not
   consulted of it yet, what we should do, and "what it is" in particular
   "that the Lord our God requireth of us;" nor declared our designs and
   intentions for a universal compliance with these great calls of God for
   repentance and turning unto the Lord. I mourn over myself night and
   day; I mourn over you continually. I do not see that life and vigour in
   returning unto God, either in our persons or in our church relation, as
   I could desire. And give me leave to say, from an experience in my own
   heart, I am jealous over you. We may proceed to consider something of
   outward duties afterward; but as yet we are not at all come to it, but
   only to inquire into our hearts what we have done in compliance with
   these calls of God, in the reformation and change of our hearts, and
   vigour of spirit in walking with him. I speak it with all tenderness,
   that none might take offence; but I do acknowledge to you, that I have
   not myself attained, nor can I, though I am labouring to bring my heart
   to that frame which God requireth in us all at this time. I find many
   obstructions: if you have attained I shall rejoice in it with all my
   heart and soul; but if not, help them that are labouring after it. I
   intend no more at present but this, -- to settle upon our souls a
   conviction that we have not as yet answered the calls of God in the
   heart: for if we have all apprehensions we have complied, the work is
   at an end.

   I hope we may in due time go on to consider all the ways and instances
   whereby we may reform and return unto God; but in the meantime I offer
   this to you, -- that unless the foundation of it be laid in a deep and
   broken sense of our past miscarriages and present frames, and I can see
   in the church some actings of a renewed spirit with vigour and
   earnestness to pursue our recovery and return to God, I shall much
   despond in this thing. But let us be persuaded that we are to lay this
   foundation (I desire we may agree upon this), that it is our duty to
   get a deep sense upon our hearts, as the first thing God aims at in his
   calls, of our past miscarriages, and of our present dead, wretched
   frame; in comparison of that vigour, liveliness, and activity of grace
   that ought to be found in us. Ought we not to lay the foundation here?
   If so, then we ought to apply ourselves unto it. It may be, though it
   be so with some, that they have such a lively, vigorous acting of faith
   in a deep and humble sense of their past miscarriages, yet it is not so
   with others; and we are looking for the edification of the whole. And
   therefore, brethren, do we judge it our present duty to labour to
   affect our hearts deeply with a sense of our present unanswerable frame
   unto the mind of God and Christ, and of our past miscarriages.

   If it be so, let us every day pray that God would keep this thing in
   the imagination of the thoughts of our hearts; not only of ourselves,
   but of one another. Observe the phrase of the Holy Ghost: when you come
   to "the thoughts of the heart," you think you can go no farther; but
   saith David, "I pray, O Lord, preserve this in the imagination of the
   thoughts of the heart of thy people;" that is, "in the first internal
   framing of our thoughts." There must be a frame acting and coining
   thoughts (if I may so say) continually in us to this propose. But I
   recommend this to you, -- that if this be a truth, and we are convinced
   it is our duty to labour to affect our hearts with a sense of the
   unanswerableness of our souls, and the frame of our minds unto the will
   of God and the holiness of Christ, who is coming to visit his churches,
   -- "What manner of persons ought we to be?" Not such as we have been.
   We should labour for a deep sense of this, and I hope it may not be
   unsuitable unto you; for if any of us have any corruption, temptation,
   or disorder in our spirits and ways to conflict withal, in vain,
   believe me, shall we contend against it, unless we lay this foundation.

   I know one great means for the beginning and carrying on of this work,
   is by earnest crying unto God, -- by prayers and supplications, and
   humiliations. I am loath to issue it there; I have seen so many days of
   humiliation without reformation, that I dare not issue it there: we
   shall make use of them as God shall help us. I desire the church would
   do so, if they find in themselves a sense of duty, and a heart crying
   to God in sincerity and truth. I have now been very long, though very
   unprofitable, in the ministration of the word; and I have observed the
   beginning of churches, and wish I do not see the end of them in this
   their confidence of mere profession, and the observation of these
   duties of humiliation. God knows, I have thought often of this thing;
   and I say I dare not issue it there. Let us have as many as we have
   hearts for, and no more; and as many as shall end with reformation, but
   no more. But let us all begin among ourselves; and who knows but that
   God may give wisdom to this church? I am ready to faint, and give over,
   and to beg of the church they would think of some other person to
   conduct them in my room, without these disadvantages. The last day will
   discover I have nothing but a heart to lead you in the ways of God, --
   to the enjoyment of God.
