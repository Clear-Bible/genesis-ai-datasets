INTRODUCTION.

   This Hymn Book is the result of an agreement between Alexander
   Campbell--the former proprietor of the Christian Hymn Book--and the
   Christian brotherhood at large, as represented in the American
   Christian Missionary Society. At the annual meeting of the Society, in
   1864, an overture was made by Mr. Campbell, of the copy-right of the
   Christian Hymn Book, to be held by certain brethren, in trust, on two
   conditions: 1. That a committee be mutually agreed on by himself and
   the Society, to revise and enlarge the book, so as to meet the general
   wishes of the brotherhood of Disciples; 2. That the profits arising
   from the sale of the book be given to the A. C. M. S. This overture was
   accepted, and the Committee of Revision was immediately appointed. That
   Committee, having fulfilled their task, now present the fruit of their
   labors to the public.

   It will be seen that, while the former book was made the basis of this,
   the work of revision and enlargement has been made as thorough as
   possible. Still, comparatively few hymns have been expunged. After
   making as complete an exploration as our time would allow, of the
   realms of Christian Hymnology, we were more than ever convinced of the
   value of the labor, judgment, and taste, displayed in the compilation
   of the book we have so long used and cherished. We have met with no
   book of equal size, that possesses equal merit. The principal changes
   we have made, are:

   1.--A new classification of subjects--increasing the facility of
   reference to hymns on the various subjects of song.

   2.--An unbroken series of numbers to the hymns, which, while it
   necessitates the abolition of the formal distinction between Psalms,
   Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, enables us to avoid the confusion that
   constantly grew out of the three series of numbers, which the former
   classification required.

   3.--The numbering of the stanzas of every hymn, for easy reference,
   when any stanza is omitted in singing.

   4.--An arrangement of meters, under every heading.

   5.--A greatly enlarged number and variety of hymns, suited to the
   diversified wants of personal, social, and public devotion.

   We take pleasure in acknowledging our indebtedness to numerous
   brethren, for counsel and assistance; especially to Elder William
   Baxter, whose collected material and original contributions have been
   cheerfully placed at our disposal.

   While we have admitted a few original hymns, prepared expressly for
   this work, the additions have been made mostly from the old authors, or
   from the new resources furnished by the living authors of our own and
   other lands. It is believed that the work is brought fully up to the
   resources and demands of the present time.

   Knowing that in Christian families, the Hymn Book is generally the most
   popular book of sacred poetry, and, not seldom, the sole resource of
   the family in that department, we have felt the importance of a large
   variety of the choicest lyrical productions that our language affords.
   We have done what our time and means would allow, toward this end. We
   hope that it may minister to the comfort, strength, and purity of the
   Church of God; throw over many a hearth-stone, and many a weary
   pilgrim-path, the sweet radiance of heavenly song; and give fresh
   encouragement to the cultivation of all pious sentiments and emotions,
   alike in the closet, the family, the prayer-meeting, and the public
   assembly.

   L. M.

   The works and the word of God.
   Psalm 19.

   Watts.


   The heavens declare thy glory, Lord!

   In every star thy wisdom shines;

   But when our eyes behold thy word,

   We read thy name in fairer lines.


   2 The rolling sun, the changing light,

   And nights and days, thy power confess;

   But the blest volume thou hast writ,

   Reveals thy justice and thy grace.


   3 Sun, moon, and stars, convey thy praise

   Round the whole earth, and never stand;

   So when thy truth began its race,

   It touched and glanced on every land.


   4 Nor shall thy spreading gospel rest

   Till through the world thy truth has run;

   Till Christ has all the nations blest

   That see the light, or feel the sun.


   5 Great Sun of Righteousness! arise;

   Bless the dark world with heavenly light:

   Thy gospel makes the simple wise,

   Thy laws are pure, thy judgments right.


   6 Thy noblest wonders here we view,

   In souls renewed, and sins forgiven;

   Lord! cleanse my sins, my soul renew,

   And make thy word my guide to heaven.

   Divine love displayed, etc.

   Exeter Coll.


   To thee my heart, Eternal King!

   Would now its thankful tribute bring,

   To thee its humble homage raise

   In songs of ardent, grateful praise.


   2 All nature shows thy boundless love,

   In worlds below and worlds above;

   But in thy blesséd word I trace

   The richer glories of thy grace.


   3 There what delightful truths are given;

   There Jesus shows the way to heaven;

   His name salutes my listening ear,

   Revives my heart and checks my fear.


   4 There Jesus bids our sorrows cease,

   And gives the laboring conscience peace;

   Raises our grateful feelings high,

   And points to mansions in the sky.


   5 For love like this, O, may our song

   Through endless years thy praise prolong;

   And distant climes thy name adore,

   Till time and nature are no more!
     __________________________________________________________________

   L. M.

   Nature and revelation.

   Grant.


   The starry firmament on high,

   And all the glories of the sky,

   Yet shine not to thy praise, O Lord,

   So brightly as thy written word.


   2 The hopes that holy word supplies,

   Its truths divine and precepts wise--

   In each a heavenly beam I see,

   And every beam conducts to thee.


   3 Almighty Lord! the sun shall fail,

   The moon forget her nightly tale,

   And deepest silence hush on high

   The radiant chorus of the sky--


   4 But fixed for everlasting years,

   Unmoved amid the wreck of spheres,

   Thy word shall shine in cloudless day

   When heaven and earth have passed away.
     __________________________________________________________________

   L. M.

   Strength and peace from the divine word.

   Watts.


   There is a stream whose gentle flow

   Supplies the city of our God;

   Life, love, and joy, still gliding through,

   And watering our divine abode.


   2 That sacred stream, thy holy word,

   Supports our faith, our fear controls;

   Sweet peace thy promises afford,

   And give new strength to fainting souls.
     __________________________________________________________________

   L. M.

   The Scriptures our light and guide.

   Beddome.


   When Israel through the desert passed,

   A fiery pillar went before,

   To guide them through the dreary waste,

   And lessen the fatigues they bore.


   2 Such is thy glorious word, O God;

   'Tis for our light and guidance given;

   It sheds a luster all abroad,

   And points the path to bliss and heaven.


   3 It fills the soul with sweet delight,

   And quickens its inactive powers;

   It sets our wandering footsteps right,

   Displays thy love and kindles ours.


   4 Its promises rejoice our hearts;

   Its doctrine is divinely true;

   Knowledge and pleasure it imparts;

   It comforts and instructs us too.


   5 Ye favored lands, who have this word!

   Ye saints, who feel its saving power!

   Unite your tongues to praise the Lord,

   And his distinguished grace adore.

   L. M.

   Their words to the end of the world.
   Psalm 19:4.

   Bowring.


   Upon the gospel's sacred page

   The gathered beams of ages shine;

   And, as it hastens, every age

   But makes its brightness more divine.


   2 On mightier wing, in loftier flight,

   From year to year, does knowledge soar;

   And, as it soars, the gospel light

   Becomes effulgent more and more.


   3 More glorious still, as centuries roll,

   New regions blest, new powers unfurled;

   Expanding with the expanding soul,

   Its radiance shall o'erflow the world;


   4 Flow to restore, but not destroy;

   As when the cloudless lamp of day

   Pours out its flood of light and joy,

   And sweeps the lingering mist away.
     __________________________________________________________________

   L. M.

   Hold fast the form of sound words.
   2 Tim. 1:13.

   Briggs.


   God's law demands one living faith,

   Not a gaunt crowd of lifeless creeds;

   Its warrant is a firm "God saith;"

   Its claim, not words, but living deeds.


   2 Yet, Lord, forgive; thy simple law

   Grows tarnished in our earthly grasp;

   Pure in itself, without a flaw,

   It dims in our too-worldly clasp.


   3 We handle it with unwashed hands;

   We stain it with unhallowed breath;

   We gloss it with device of man's,

   And hide thine image underneath.


   4 Forgive the sacrilege, and take

   From off our souls th' unworthy stain;

   And show us, for thy Son's dear sake

   Thy pure and perfect law again.
     __________________________________________________________________

   L. P. M.

   The entrance of thy word giveth light.
   Psalm 119:130.

   Watts.


   I love the volume of thy word;

   What light and joy those leaves afford

   To souls benighted and distressed!

   Thy precepts guide my doubtful way,

   Thy fear forbids my feet to stray,

   Thy promise leads my heart to rest.


   2 Thy threatenings wake my slumbering eyes,

   And warn me where my danger lies;

   But 'tis thy blessed gospel, Lord,

   That makes my guilty conscience clean,

   Converts my soul, subdues my sin,

   And gives a free, but large reward.


   3 Who knows the errors of his thoughts?

   My God, forgive my secret faults,

   And from presumptuous sins restrain;

   Accept my poor attempts of praise,

   That I have read thy book of grace,

   And book of nature, not in vain.

   Thy word is a lamp.
   Psalm 119:105.

   Fawcett.


   How precious is the book divine,

   By inspiration given!

   Bright as a lamp its precepts shine,

   To guide our souls to heaven.


   2 It sweetly cheers our drooping hearts

   In this dark vale of tears;

   Life, light, and joy, it still imparts,

   And quells our rising fears.


   3 This lamp, through all the tedious night

   Of life, shall guide our way,

   Till we behold the clearer light

   Of an eternal day.

   C. M.

   Thy testimonies are my delight.
   Psalm 119:24.

   Mrs. Steele.


   Father of Mercies! in thy word

   What endless glory shines!

   For ever be thine name adored

   For these celestial lines!


   2 Here may the wretched sons of want

   Exhaustless riches find;

   Riches above what earth can grant,

   And lasting as the mind.


   3 Here the fair tree of knowledge grows,

   And yields a rich repast:

   Sublimer sweets than nature knows

   Invite the longing taste.


   4 Here springs of consolation rise

   To cheer the fainting mind,

   And thirsty souls receive supplies,

   And sweet refreshment find.


   5 Here the Redeemer's welcome voice,

   Spreads heavenly peace around;

   And life and everlasting joys

   Attend the blissful sound.


   6 O may these heavenly pages be

   My ever dear delight;

   And still new beauties may I see,

   And still increasing light.


   7 Divine Instructor! gracious Lord,

   Be thou for ever near;

   Teach me to love thy sacred word,

   And view my Saviour there!

   A light unto my path.
   Psalm 119:105.

   Cowper.


   What glory gilds the sacred page,

   Majestic like the sun!

   It gives a light to every age--

   It gives but borrows none.


   2 The hand that gave it, still supplies

   His gracious light and heat;

   His truths upon the nations rise--

   They rise, but never set.


   3 Let everlasting thanks be thine

   For such a bright display,

   As makes the world of darkness shine

   With beams of heavenly day.


   4 My soul rejoices to pursue

   The paths of truth and love,

   Till glory breaks upon my view

   In brighter worlds above.

   Thy law is my delight.
   Psalm 119:174.

   Watts.


   Lord, I have made thy word my choice,

   My lasting heritage;

   There shall my noblest powers rejoice,

   My warmest thoughts engage.


   2 I'll read the histories of thy love,

   And keep thy laws in sight;

   While through the promises I rove,

   With ever fresh delight.


   3 'Tis a broad land, of wealth unknown,

   Where springs of life arise,

   Seeds of immortal bliss are sown,

   And hidden glory lies.


   4 The best relief that mourners have;

   It makes our sorrows blest;

   Our fairest hope beyond the grave,

   And our eternal rest.

   Revelation welcomed.


   Hail, sacred truth! whose piercing rays

   Dispel the shades of night,

   Diffusing o'er a sinful world

   The healing beams of light.


   2 Thy word, O Lord, with friendly aid,

   Restores our wandering feet,

   Converts the sorrows of the mind

   To joys divinely sweet.


   3 O, send thy light and truth abroad,

   In all their radiant blaze;

   And bid the admiring world adore

   The glories of thy grace.

   O, how I love thy law.
   Psalm 119:97.

   Watts.


   O how I love thy holy law!

   'Tis daily my delight;

   And thence my meditations draw

   Divine advice by night.


   2 I wake before the dawn of day,

   To meditate thy word;

   My soul with longing melts away,

   To bear thy gospel, Lord.


   3 How doth thy word my heart engage,

   How well employ my tongue;

   And in my tiresome pilgrimage,

   Yields me a heavenly song.


   4 When nature sinks, and spirits droop,

   Thy promises of grace

   Are pillars to support my hope,

   And there I write thy praise.

   Wherewithal shall a young man, etc.
   Psalm 119:9.

   Watts.


   How shall the young secure their hearts,

   And guard their lives from sin?

   Thy word the choicest rules imparts

   To keep the conscience clean.


   2 'Tis like the sun, a heavenly light,

   That guides us all the day,

   And through the dangers of the night,

   A lamp to lead our way.


   3 Thy precepts make us truly wise;

   We hate the sinner's road;

   We hate our own vain thoughts that rise,

   But love the law, O God.


   4 Thy word is everlasting truth;

   How pure is every page!

   That holy book shall guide our youth

   And well support our age.

   Word of the everlasting God.

   Barton.


   Lamp of our feet! whereby we trace

   Our path when wont to stray;

   Stream from the fount of heavenly grace!

   Brook by the traveler's way!


   2 Bread of our souls, whereon we feed!

   True manna from on high!

   Our guide and chart! wherein we read

   Of realms beyond the sky.


   3 Pillar of fire through watches dark,

   And radiant cloud by day!

   When waves would whelm our tossing bark,

   Our anchor and our stay!

   2 Celestial light it sheds

   To cheer this vale below;

   To distant lands its glory spreads,

   And streams of mercy flow.

   2 The darkness and the light

   Still keep their course the same;

   While night to day, and day to night,

   Divinely teach his name.


   3 In every different land,

   Their general voice is known;

   They show the wonders of his hand,

   And orders of his throne.


   4 Ye Christian lands! rejoice;

   Here he reveals his word;

   To bid us know the Lord.

   Precious treasure! thou art mine:

   Mine to tell me whence I came;

   Mine to teach me what I am;

   Mine to show a Saviour's love;

   Mine to show, by living faith,

   Man can triumph over death;

   Book of grace, and book of glory!

   Gift of God to age and youth;

   Bright, bright with truth.


   2 Book of love! in accents tender,

   Speaking unto such as we;

   May it lead us, Lord, to render

   All, all to thee.


   3 Book of hope! the spirit sighing,

   Consolation finds in thee;

   As it hears the Saviour crying--

   The word more precious than gold.

   Newton.


   Precious Bible! what a treasure

   Does the word of God afford!

   All I want for life or pleasure,

   Food and med'cine, shield and sword:

   Let the world account me poor,

   Having this I need no more.


   2 Food to which the world's a stranger,

   Here my hungry soul enjoys;

   Of excess there is no danger--

   Though it fills, it never cloys:

   On a dying Christ I feed,

   He is meat and drink indeed!


   3 When my faith is faint and sickly,

   Or when Satan wounds my mind;

   Cordials to revive me quickly,

   Healing med'cines here I find:

   To the promises I flee,

   Each affords a remedy.


   4 In the hour of dark temptation,

   Satan can not make me yield;

   For the word of consolation

   Is to me a mighty shield:

   While the scripture truths are sure,

   From his malice I'm secure.


   5 Vain his threats to overcome me,

   When I take the Spirit's sword;

   Then, with ease, I drive him from me;

   Satan trembles at the word:

   'Tis a sword for conquest made,

   Keen the edge, and strong the blade.


   6 Shall I envy, then, the miser,

   Doating on his golden store?

   Sure I am, or should be, wiser;

   I am rich--'tis he is poor:

   Jesus gives me in his word,

   Food and med'cine, shield and sword.

   The family Bible.


   How painfully pleasing the fond recollection

   Of youthful connections and innocent joy,

   When blessed with parental advice and affection,

   Surrounded with mercies--with peace from on high!

   I still view the chairs of my father and mother,

   The seats of their offspring as ranged on each hand;

   And that richest of books which excelled every other,

   The family Bible that lay on the stand:

   The old-fashioned Bible, the dear blesséd Bible,

   The family Bible that lay on the stand.


   2 That Bible, the volume of God's inspiration,

   At morn and at evening could yield us delight;

   And the prayer of our sire was a sweet invocation

   For mercy by day and for safety through night;

   Our hymn of thanksgiving with harmony swelling,

   All warm from the heart of the family band,

   Has raised us from earth to that rapturous dwelling

   Described in the Bible that lay on the stand:

   The old-fashioned Bible, the dear, blesséd Bible,

   The family Bible that lay on the stand.


   3 Ye scenes of tranquillity, long have we parted,

   My hopes almost gone, and my parents no more:

   In sorrow and sadness I live broken-hearted,

   And wander unknown on a far distant shore;

   Yet how can I doubt a dear Saviour's protection,

   Forgetful of gifts from his bountiful hand!

   O let me with patience receive his correction,

   And think of the Bible that lay on the stand:

   The old-fashioned Bible, the dear, blesséd Bible,

   The family Bible that lay on the stand.

   Great is the Lord.

   Watts.


   Praise ye the Lord! 'tis good to raise

   Our hearts and voices in his praise:

   His nature and his works invite

   To make this duty our delight.


   2 Great is the Lord! and great his might,

   And all his glories infinite:

   His wisdom vast, and knows no bound;

   A deep where all our thoughts are drowned.


   3 He loves the meek, rewards the just,

   Humbles the wicked in the dust,

   Melts and subdues the stubborn soul,

   And makes the broken spirit whole.


   4 His saints are precious in his sight;

   He views his children with delight;

   He sees their hope, he knows their fear,

   Approves and loves his image there.

   Eternity of God.

   F. Lyte.


   Ere mountains reared their forms sublime,

   Or heaven and earth in order stood--

   Before the birth of ancient time,

   From everlasting thou art God.


   2 A thousand ages, in their flight,

   With thee are as a fleeting day;

   Past, present, future, to thy sight

   At once their various scenes display.


   3 But our brief life's a shadowy dream,

   A passing thought, that soon is o'er,

   That fades with morning's earliest beam,

   And fills the musing mind no more.


   4 To us, O Lord, the wisdom give

   Each passing moment so to spend,

   That we at length with thee may live,

   Where life and bliss shall never end.

   "How unsearchable are thy judgments."
   Rom. 11:33.

   Ray Palmer.


   Lord, my weak thought in vain would climb

   To search the starry vault profound:

   In vain would wing her flight sublime,

   To find creation's outmost bound.


   2 But weaker yet that thought must prove

   To search thy great eternal plan--

   Thy sovereign counsels, born of love

   Long ages ere the world began.


   3 When my dim reason would demand

   Why that, or this, thou dost ordain,

   By some vast deep I seem to stand,

   Whose secrets I must ask in vain.


   4 When doubts disturb my troubled breast,

   And all is dark as night to me,

   Here, as on solid rock, I rest;

   That so it seemeth good to thee.


   5 Be this my joy, that evermore

   Thou rulest all things at thy will:

   Thy sovereign wisdom I adore,

   Omnipresence of God.


   Father of spirits! nature's God,

   Our inmost thoughts are known to thee:

   Thou, Lord, canst hear each idle word,

   And every private action see.


   2 Could we, on morning's swiftest wings,

   Pursue our flight through trackless air,

   Or dive beneath deep ocean's springs,

   Thy presence still would meet us there.


   3 In vain may guilt attempt to fly,

   Concealed beneath the pall of night:

   One glance from thy all-piercing eye,

   Can kindle darkness into light.


   4 Search thou our hearts, and there destroy

   Each evil thought, each secret sin,

   And fit us for those realms of joy

   Where naught impure shall enter in.

   The Lord reigneth.
   Psalm 96:10.

   Watts.


   Jehovah reigns; his throne is high;

   His robes are light and majesty;

   His glory shines with beams so bright

   No mortal can sustain the sight.


   2 His terrors keep the world in awe;

   His justice guards his holy law;

   His love reveals a smiling face.

   His truth and promise seal the grace.


   3 Through all his works his wisdom shines,

   And baffles Satan's deep designs;

   His power is sovereign to fulfill

   The noblest counsels of his will.


   4 And will this glorious Lord descend

   To be my father and my friend?

   Then let my songs with angels join;

   Heaven is secure, if God be mine.

   With one consent let all the earth

   To God their cheerful voices raise;

   Glad homage pay, with awful mirth,

   And sing before him songs of praise:


   2 Convinced that he is God alone,

   From whom both we and all proceed;

   We, whom he chooses for his own,

   The flock that he vouchsafes to keep.


   3 O, enter, then, his temple gate,

   Thence to his courts devoutly press;

   And still your grateful hymns repeat,

   And still his name with praises bless.


   4 For he's the Lord supremely good,

   His mercy is for ever sure;

   His truth, which always firmly stood,

   To endless ages shall endure.

   What thickest darkness vails, to thee

   Shines clearly as the morning light.


   3 Thine, Lord, is holiness, alone:

   Justice and truth before thee stand:

   Yet, nearer to thy sacred throne,

   Love ever dwells at thy right hand.

   And to thy love and ceaseless care,

   Proclaims thy love to all below;

   Of ceaseless praises to thy name.

   And sends to earth his rays of light;

   While darkness from his brightness hides,

   And vanishes from human sight;

   Declares thy goodness gave it birth.


   3 The moon and stars, that rule at night,

   And smile upon this world of wrong,

   Bear on each trembling chord of light

   The notes of this sweet, sacred song;

   "Thou, Lord, didst make all things that move;

   All are the creatures of thy love."


   4 Then help my poor, unworthy heart

   To join aloud in nature's praise;

   And may my song, in every part,

   Proclaim the wonders of thy ways;

   And when I reach the heavenly plains,

   I'll sing thy love in nobler strains.

   Through heaven its joys for ever run,

   And o'er the earth they flow.

   And glides in every rill.

   3 Soon as the evening shades prevail,

   The moon takes up the wondrous tale,

   And nightly to the listening earth

   Repeats the story of her birth:


   4 While all the stars that round her burn,

   And all the planets in their turn,

   Confirm the tidings as they roll,

   And spread the truth from pole to pole,


   5 What though in solemn silence all

   Move round this dark terrestrial ball--

   What though no real voice nor sound

   Amid their radiant orbs be found--


   6 In reason's ear they all rejoice,

   Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;

   From realm to realm the notes shall sound,

   And heaven's exulting sons rejoice

   To bear the full hosanna round.


   2 When, starting from the shades of night,

   Obedient, Lord, to thy behest,

   The sun arrayed his limbs in light

   And earth her virgin beauty drest;


   3 Thy praise transported nature sung

   In pealing chorus loud and far;

   The echoing vault with rapture rung,

   And shouted every morning star.


   4 When bending from his native sky,

   The Lord of life in mercy came,

   And laid his bright effulgence by,

   To bear on earth a human name;


   5 The song, by cherub voices raised,

   Rolled through the dark blue depths above,

   And Israel's shepherds heard amazed

   The seraph notes of peace and love.


   And shall not man the concert join,

   For whom this bright creation rose--

   For whom the fires of morning shine

   And eve's still lamps, that woo repose?


   2 And shall not he the chorus swell,

   Whose form the incarnate Godhead wore,

   Whose guilt, whose fears, whose triumph tell

   How deep the wounds his Saviour bore?


   3 Long as yon glittering arch shall bend,

   Long as yon orbs in glory roll,

   Long as the streams of life descend

   To cheer with hope the fainting soul,


   4 Thy praise shall fill each grateful voice,

   Shall bid the song of rapture sound;

   And heaven's exulting sons rejoice

   To bear the full hosanna round.

   And skies and stars obey thy word:

   Thy throne was fixed on high

   Before the starry sky:

   Eternal is thy kingdom, Lord!


   3 Thy promises are true;

   Thy grace is ever new;

   There fixed, thy church shall ne'er remove:

   Thy saints, with holy fear,

   Shall in thy courts appear,

   And sing thine everlasting love.

   He guards the souls of all his friends,

   3 Immortal light and joys unknown

   Are for the saints in darkness sown;

   Those glorious seeds shall spring and rise,

   O Lord, how full of sweet content

   My years of pilgrimage are spent!

   Where'er I dwell, I dwell with thee,

   In heaven, in earth, or on the sea.


   2 To me remains nor place nor time;

   My country is in every clime:

   I can be calm and free from care

   On any shore, since God is there.


   3 While place I seek, or place I shun,

   The soul finds happiness in none;

   But with my God to guide my way,

   'Tis equal joy to go or stay.


   4 Could I be cast where thou art not,

   That were indeed a dreadful lot;

   But regions none remote I call,

   Secure of finding God in all.

   And guard me with a watchful eye:

   My noonday walks he shall attend,

   And all my midnight hours defend.


   2 When in the sultry glebe I faint,

   Or on the thirsty mountains pant,

   To fertile vales and dewy meads

   My weary, wandering steps he leads,

   Where peaceful rivers, soft and slow,

   Amid the verdant landscape flow.


   3 Though in a bare and rugged way,

   Through devious, lonely wilds I stray,

   His bounty shall my pains beguile;

   The barren wilderness shall smile,

   With lively greens and herbage crowned,

   And streams shall murmur all around.


   4 Though in the paths of death I tread,

   With gloomy horrors overspread,

   My steadfast heart shall fear no ill,

   For thou, O Lord! art with me still;

   Thy friendly crook shall give me aid,

   And guide me through the dismal shade.

   All things are yours.

   Beddome.


   Since God is mine, then present things

   And things to come are mine;

   Yea, Christ, his word, and Spirit, too,

   And glory all divine.


   2 Since he is mine, then from his love

   He every trouble sends;

   All things are working for my good,

   And bliss his rod attends.


   3 Since he is mine, I need not fear

   The rage of earth and hell;

   He will support my feeble power,

   Their utmost force repel.


   4 Since he is mine, let friends forsake,

   Let wealth and honors flee:

   Sure, he who giveth me himself,

   Is more than these to me.


   5 Since he is mine, I'll boldly pass

   Through death's dark, lonely vale:

   He is my comfort and my stay,

   When heart and flesh shall fail.


   6 And now, O Lord, since thou art mine,

   What can I wish beside?

   My soul shall at the fountain live,

   When all the streams are dried.

   Providence.

   Watts.


   Let the whole race of creatures lie

   In dust before the Lord!

   Whate'er his powerful hand has formed,

   He governs with a word.


   2 Ten thousand ages ere the skies

   Were into motion brought,

   All the long years and worlds to come

   Stood present to his thought.


   3 There's not a sparrow, or a worm,

   O'erlooked in his decrees:

   He raises monarchs to a throne,

   Or sinks with equal ease.


   4 If light attend the course I go,

   'Tis he provides the rays;

   And 'tis his hand that hides the sun,

   If darkness cloud my days.


   5 Trusting his wisdom and his love,

   I would not wish to know

   What, in the book of his decrees,

   Awaits me here below.


   6 Be this alone my fervent prayer:

   Whate'er my lot may be,

   Or joys, or sorrows--may they form

   My soul for heaven and thee!

   The Lord descended from above

   And bowed the heavens most high,

   And underneath his feet he cast

   The darkness of the sky.


   2 On cherubim and seraphim

   Full royally he rode;

   And on the wings of mighty winds,

   Came flying all abroad.


   3 He sat serene upon the floods,

   Their fury to restrain;

   And he, as sovereign Lord and King,

   For evermore shall reign.

   4 He crowns thy life with love,

   He that redeemed our souls from death,

   Hath boundless power to save.


   5 He fills the poor with good;

   He gives the sufferers rest:

   Though troubles assail, and dangers affright,

   The scripture assures us, The Lord will provide.


   2 The birds without barn or storehouse are fed;

   From them let us learn to trust for our bread:

   His saints what is fitting shall ne'er be denied,

   So long as 'tis written, The Lord will provide.


   3 We may, like the ships, by tempests be tossed

   On perilous deeps, but can not be lost:

   Though Satan enrages the wind and the tide,

   The promise engages, The Lord will provide.


   4 His call we obey, like Abrah'm of old,

   Not knowing our way, but faith makes us bold:

   For though we are strangers, we have a good guide,

   And trust, in all dangers, The Lord will provide.


   5 No strength of our own, or goodness, we claim;

   But since we have known the Saviour's great name,

   In this our strong tower for safety we hide--

   The Lord is our power--The Lord will provide.

   Again a life divine he feels,

   Despises earth and walks with God.

   Is ransomed man ordained to be!

   With honor, holiness, and love,

   No seraph more adorned than he.

   A voice of more than mortal sound,

   In distant hallelujahs stole,

   Wild murmuring o'er the raptured soul.


   3 On wheels of light, on wings of flame,

   The glorious hosts of Zion came;

   High heaven with songs of triumph rung,

   While thus they struck their harps and sung:


   4 "O Zion, lift thy raptured eye;

   The long-expected hour is nigh;

   The joys of nature rise again;

   The Prince of Salem comes to reign.


   5 "See, Mercy, from her golden urn,

   Pours a rich stream to them that mourn;

   Behold, she binds with tender care

   The bleeding bosom of despair.


   6 "He comes to cheer the trembling heart:

   Bids Satan and his host depart;

   Again the day-star gilds the gloom,

   Again the bowers of Eden bloom."

   Glory to God--good will to men.


   In hymns of praise, eternal God,

   When thy creating hand

   Stretched the blue arch of heaven abroad,

   And meted sea and land,

   The morning stars together sung,

   And shouts of joy from angels rung.


   2 Than earth's prime hour, more joyous far

   Was the eventful morn,

   When the bright beam of Bethlehem's star

   Announced a Saviour born!

   Then sweeter strains from heaven began

   "Glory to God--good will to man."


   3 Babe of the manger! can it be?

   Art thou the Son of God?

   Shall subject nations bow the knee,

   And kings obey thy nod?

   Shall thrones and monarchs prostrate fall

   Before the tenant of a stall?


   4 'Tis he! the hymning seraphs cry,

   While hovering drawn to earth;

   'Tis he, the shepherds' songs reply;

   Hail! hail! Immanuel's birth;

   The rod of peace those hands shall bear,

   That brow a crown of glory wear!


   5 'Tis he! the eastern sages sing,

   And spread their golden hoard;

   'Tis he! the hills of Zion ring,

   Hosanna to the Lord!

   The Prince of long prophetic years

   To-day in Bethlehem appears!

   Song of the angels.

   E. H. Sears.


   It came upon the midnight clear,

   That glorious song of old,

   From angels bending near the earth

   To touch their harps of gold:

   "Peace to the earth, good will to men,

   From heaven's all-gracious King;"

   The world in solemn stillness lay

   To hear the angels sing.


   2 Still through the cloven skies they come

   With peaceful wings unfurled;

   And still their heavenly music floats

   O'er all the weary world:

   Above its sad and lowly plains

   They bend on heavenly wing,

   And ever o'er its Babel sounds

   The blesséd angels sing.


   3 Yet with the woes of sin and strife

   The world has suffered long;

   Beneath the angel-strain have rolled

   Two thousand years of wrong;

   And men, at war with men, hear not

   The love-song which they bring:

   O! hush the noise, ye men of strife,

   And hear the angels sing!


   4 And ye, beneath life's crushing load,

   Whose forms are bending low,

   Who toil along the climbing way

   With painful steps and slow;

   Look now! for glad and golden hours

   Come swiftly on the wing:

   O! rest beside the weary road,

   And hear the angels sing!


   5 For lo! the days are hastening on,

   By prophet-bards foretold,

   When with the ever-circling years

   Comes round the age of gold;

   When peace shall over all the earth

   Its ancient splendor fling,

   And the whole world send back the song

   Which now the angels sing.

   Mortals! awake, with angels join,

   And chant the solemn lay;

   Love, joy, and gratitude combine

   To hail the auspicious day.


   2 In heaven the rapturous song began,

   And sweet seraphic fire

   Through all the shining legions ran,

   And swept the sounding lyre.


   3 The theme, the song, the joy was new

   To each angelic tongue;

   Swift through the realms of light it flew,

   And loud the echo rung.


   4 Down through the portals of the sky

   The pealing anthem ran,

   And angels flew with eager joy

   To bear the news to man.


   5 Hark! the cherubic armies shout,

   And glory leads the song,

   Peace and salvation swell the note

   Of all the heavenly throng.


   6 With joy the chorus we'll repeat,

   "Glory to God on high!

   Good will and peace are now complete--

   Jesus was born to die!"


   7 Hail, Prince of life! for ever hail!

   Though earth, and time, and life shall fail,

   Thy praise shall never end.

   The Saviour promised long!

   Let every heart prepare a throne,

   And every voice a song.


   2 He comes, the prisoner to release

   In Satan's bondage held;

   The gates of brass before him burst,

   The iron fetters yield.


   3 He comes, from thickest films of vice

   To clear the mental ray,

   And on the eyeballs of the blind

   To pour celestial day.


   4 He comes, the broken heart to bind,

   The bleeding soul to cure,

   And with the treasures of his grace

   To enrich the humble poor.


   5 Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace,

   The welcome shall proclaim,

   And heaven's eternal arches ring

   With thy belovéd name.

   Let men their songs employ;

   While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains,

   Repeat the sounding joy.


   3 No more let sins and sorrows grow,

   Nor thorns infest the ground;

   He comes to make his blessings flow

   Far as the curse is found.

   And makes the nations prove

   The glories of his righteousness,

   And wonders of his love.

   Gild the spot that gave them birth?

   Traveler, ages are its own:

   See! it bursts o'er all the earth!

   2 He has come--the Prince of Peace--

   3 He, the mighty King, has come!

   Making the poor earth his home

   Come to bear sin's heavy load;

   Son of David, Son of God.


   4 He has come, whose name of grace

   Speaks deliverance to our race;

   Left for us his glad abode;

   Ne'er has earth beheld a morn

   Numbered in the morns of time,

   As the light falls on their eyes:

   Now, again, the earth rejoices,

   Satan's powerful kingdom shakes,

   As, from all the heavenly voices,

   Louder still the chorus breaks!

   Glory in the highest heaven! etc.


   3 Rise and shine, Star of Salvation!

   Spread thy beams o'er all the earth,

   Till each distant land and nation

   Owns and speaks thy matchless worth!

   Nor dares the holy man refuse:

   Jesus descends beneath the wave,

   The emblem of his future grave!


   2 Wonder, ye heavens! your Maker lies

   In deeps concealed from human view;

   Ye saints, behold him sink and rise;

   A fit example this for you:

   The sacred record, while you read,

   Calls you to imitate the deed.


   3 But, lo! from yonder opening skies,

   What beams of dazzling glory spread!

   Dove-like the Holy Spirit flies,

   And lights on the Redeemer's head:

   Amazed they see the power divine

   Around the Saviour's temples shine.


   4 But, hark! my soul, hark, and adore!

   What sounds are those that roll along?

   Not loud, like Sinai's awful roar;

   But soft and sweet as Gabriel's song:

   "This is my well-belovéd Son,

   The meekness and gentleness of Christ.
   2 Cor. 10:1.

   A. C. Coxe.


   How beauteous were the marks divine,

   That in thy meekness used to shine;

   That lit thy lonely pathway, trod

   In wondrous love, O Son of God!


   2 O, who like thee--so calm, so bright,

   So pure, so made to live in light?

   O, who like thee did ever go

   So patient through a world of woe?


   3 O, who like thee so humbly bore

   The scorn, the scoffs of men, before?

   So meek, forgiving, godlike, high,

   So glorious in humility?


   4 The bending angels stooped to see,

   The lisping infant clasp thy knee,

   And smile, as in a father's eye,

   Upon thy mild divinity.


   5 And death, which sets the prisoner free,

   Was pang, and scoff, and scorn to thee;

   Yet love through all thy torture glowed,

   And mercy with thy life-blood flowed.


   6 O, in thy light be mine to go,

   Illuming all my way of woe;

   And give me ever on the road

   To trace thy footsteps, Son of God!

   His miracles.

   Watts.


   Behold the blind their sight receive!

   Behold the dead awake and live!

   The dumb speak wonders, and the lame

   Leap like the hart, and bless his name!


   2 Thus doth the Holy Spirit own

   And seal the mission of the Son;

   The Father vindicates his cause,

   While he hangs bleeding on the cross.


   3 He dies: the heavens in mourning stood;

   He rises by the power of God:

   Behold the Lord ascending high,

   No more to bleed, no more to die!


   4 Hence and for ever from my heart

   I bid my doubts and fears depart;

   And to those hands my soul resign,

   Which bear credentials so divine.

   Watts.


   My dear Redeemer and my Lord,

   I read my duty in thy word;

   But in thy life the law appears

   Drawn out in living characters.


   2 Such was thy truth, and such thy zeal,

   Such deference to thy Father's will,

   Such love, and meekness so divine;

   I would transcribe and make them mine.


   3 Cold mountains and the midnight air

   Witnessed the fervor of thy prayer;

   The desert thy temptations knew,

   Thy conflict and thy victory too.


   4 Be thou my pattern; make me bear

   More of thy gracious image here;

   Then God the judge shall own my name

   Among the followers of the Lamb.

   He so loved the world.
   John 3:16.

   Watts.


   Not to condemn the sons of men,

   Did Christ, the Son of God, appear;

   No weapons in his hands are seen,

   No flaming sword, nor thunder there.


   2 Such was the pity of our God,

   He loved the race of man so well,

   He sent his Son to bear our load

   Of sins, and save our souls from hell.


   3 Sinners, believe the Saviour's word;

   Trust in his mighty name, and live:

   A thousand joys his lips afford,

   His hands a thousand blessings give.

   His poverty.


   As much have I of worldly good

   As e'er my Master had;

   I diet on as dainty food,

   And am as richly clad;

   Though plain my garb, though scant my hoard,

   As Mary's Son and nature's Lord.


   2 The manger was his infant bed,

   His home the mountain cave;

   He had not where to lay his head--

   He borrowed e'en his grave;

   Earth yielded him no resting-spot;

   Her Maker, but she knew him not.


   3 As much the world's good-will I share,

   Its favors and applause,

   As he whose blessed name I bear,

   Hated without a cause;

   Despised, rejected, mocked by pride,

   Betrayed, forsaken, crucified.


   4 Why should I court my Master's foe?

   Why should I fear its frown?

   Why should I seek for rest below?

   Or sigh for brief renown?

   A pilgrim to a better land,

   An heir of joy at God's right hand.

   Acts 10:38.

   Enfield.


   Behold, where, in a mortal form,

   Appears each grace divine;

   The virtues, all in Jesus met,

   With mildest radiance shine.


   2 To spread the rays of heavenly light,

   To give the mourner joy,

   To preach glad tidings to the poor,

   Was his divine employ.


   3 'Midst keen reproach, and cruel scorn,

   Patient and meek he stood;

   His foes, ungrateful, sought his life;

   He labored for their good.


   4 In the last hour of deep distress,

   Before his Father's throne,

   With soul resigned, he bowed, and said,

   "Thy will, not mine, be done!"


   5 Be Christ our pattern and our guide;

   His image may we bear;

   O, may we tread his holy steps,

   His joy and glory share!

   A pilgrim through this lonely world,

   The blessed Saviour passed;

   A mourner all his life was he,

   A dying Lamb at last.


   2 That tender heart which felt for all,

   For us its life-blood gave;

   It found on earth no resting-place,

   Save only in the grave!


   3 Such was our Lord: and shall we fear

   The cross with all its scorn?

   Or love a faithless, evil world,

   That wreathed his brow with thorn?


   4 No; facing all its frowns or smiles,

   Like him, obedient still,

   We homeward press, through storm or calm,

   To Zion's blessed hill.

   The winds were howling o'er the deep;

   Each wave a watery hill;

   The Saviour wakened from his sleep;

   He spake, and all was still.


   2 The madman in a tomb had made

   His mansion of despair;

   Woe to the traveler who strayed,

   With heedless footsteps, there.


   3 He met that glance so thrilling sweet,

   He heard those accents mild;

   And, melting at Messiah's feet,

   Wept like a weanéd child.


   4 O, madder than the raving man!

   O, deafer than the sea!

   How long the time since Christ began

   To call in vain to me!


   5 Yet could I hear him once again,

   As I have heard of old,

   Methinks he should not call in vain

   His wanderer to the fold.

   Medley.


   O could I speak the matchless worth,

   O could I sound the glories forth,

   Which in my Saviour shine;

   I'd soar, and touch the heavenly strings,

   And vie with Gabriel, while he sings

   In notes almost divine.


   2 I'd sing the precious blood he spilt,

   My ransom from the dreadful guilt

   Of sin, and wrath divine;

   I'd sing his glorious righteousness,

   In which all-perfect, heavenly dress,

   My soul shall ever shine.


   3 I'd sing the characters he bears,

   And all the forms of love he wears,

   Exalted on his throne;

   In loftiest songs of sweetest praise,

   I would to everlasting days

   Make all his glories known.


   4 Well, the delightful day will come,

   When my dear Lord will bring me home,

   And I shall see his face;

   Then, with my Saviour, Brother, Friend,

   A blest eternity I'll spend,

   Triumphant in his grace.

   A bruised reed he shall not break.
   Matt. 12:20.


   To the hall of that feast came the sinful and fair:

   She heard in the city that Jesus was there:

   Unheeding the splendor that blazed on the board,

   She silently knelt at the feet of her Lord!


   2 The hair on her forehead, so sad and so meek,

   Hung dark on the blushes that glowed on her cheek;

   And so sad and so lowly she knelt in her shame,

   It seemed that her spirit had fled from her frame.


   3 The frown and the murmur went round thro' them all,

   That one so unhallowed should tread in the hall;

   And some said the poor would be objects more meet

   For the wealth of the perfume she showered on his feet.


   4 She heard but her Saviour--she spoke but in sighs,

   She dared not look up to the heaven of his eyes:

   And the hot tears gushed forth at each heave of her breast,

   As her lips to his sandals she throbbingly pressed.


   5 In the sky, after tempest, as shineth the bow,

   In the glance of the sunbeam as melteth the snow,

   Ho looked on the lost one--her sins were forgiven,

   And Mary went forth in the beauty of heaven!

   Sacred tears.

   Mrs. St. Leon Loud.


   Draw near, ye weary, bowed, and broken-hearted,

   Ye onward travelers to a peaceful bourne;

   Ye from whose path the light hath all departed;

   Ye who are left in solitude to mourn;

   Though o'er your spirits hath the storm-cloud swept,

   Sacred are sorrow's tears, since "Jesus wept."


   2 The bright and spotless heir of endless glory,

   Wept o'er the woes of those he came to save;

   And angels wondered when they heard the story

   That he who conquered death wept o'er the grave;

   For 'twas not when his lonely watch he kept

   In dark Gethsemane, that "Jesus wept."


   3 But with the friends he loved, whose hope had perished,

   The Saviour stood, while through his bosom rushed

   A tide of sympathy for those he cherished,

   And from his eyes the burning tear-drops gushed;

   And bending o'er the tomb where Lazarus slept,

   In agony of spirit, "Jesus wept."


   4 Lo! Jesus' power the sleep of death hath broken,

   And wiped the tear from sorrow's drooping eye!

   Look up, ye mourners, hear what he hath spoken:

   "He that believes on me, shall never die."

   Through faith and love your spirits shall be kept;

   Hope brighter grew on earth when "Jesus wept."

   He made himself of no reputation.
   Phil. 2:7.

   Doane.


   He came with his heavenly crown,

   His scepter clad with power;

   His coming was in feebleness,

   The infant of an hour;

   An humble manger cradled, first,

   The Virgin's holy birth,

   And lowing herds surrounded there

   The Lord of heaven and earth.


   2 He came, not in his robe of wrath,

   With arm outstretched to slay;

   But on the darkling paths of earth,

   To pour celestial day;

   To guide in peace the wandering feet,

   The broken heart to bind,

   And bear upon the painful cross,

   The sins of human kind.


   3 And thou hast borne them, Saviour meek!

   And therefore unto thee,

   In humbleness and gratitude,

   Our hearts shall offered be;

   Our contrite hearts, an offering, Lord,

   Which thou wilt not despise,

   Our souls, our bodies, all be thine,

   A living sacrifice!

   3 Jesus wept, and still in glory

   He can mark each mourner's tear--

   Living to retrace the story

   Of the hearts he solaced here.

   Lord, when I am called to die,

   Let me think of Bethany!


   4 Jesus wept! that tear of sorrow

   Is a legacy of love;

   Yesterday, to-day, to-morrow,

   O suffering Friend of human kind!

   How, as the fatal hour drew near,

   Came thronging on thy holy mind

   The images of grief and fear!


   2 Gethsemane's sad midnight scene,

   The faithless friends, th' exulting foes,

   The thorny crown, the insult keen,

   The scourge, the cross, before thee rose.


   3 Did not thy spirit shrink dismayed,

   As the dark vision o'er it came;

   And, though in sinless strength arrayed,

   Turn, shuddering, from the death of shame?


   4 Onward, like thee, through scorn and dread,

   May we our Father's call obey,

   Steadfast thy path of duty tread,

   And rise, through death, to endless day.

   Led as a lamb to the slaughter.

   The morning dawns upon the place

   Where Jesus spent the night in prayer;

   Through yielding glooms behold his face!

   Nor form, nor comeliness is there.


   2 Brought forth to judgment, now he stands

   Arraigned, condemned, at Pilate's bar;

   Here, spurned by fierce pretorian bands;

   There, mocked by Herod's men of war.


   3 He bears their buffeting and scorn--

   Mock-homage of the lip, the knee--

   The purple robe, the crown of thorn--

   The scourge, the nail, the accursed tree.


   4 No guile within his mouth is found;

   He neither threatens nor complains;

   Meek as a lamb for slaughter bound,

   Dumb 'mid his murderers he remains.


   5 But hark, he prays; 'tis for his foes

   And speaks: 'tis comfort to his friends;

   Answers: and paradise bestows;

   He bows his head: the conflict ends.

   The suffering Saviour prays alone.


   2 'Tis midnight; and, from all removed,

   The Saviour wrestles lone, with fears;

   E'en that disciple whom he loved

   Heeds not his Master's grief and tears.


   3 'Tis midnight; and for others' guilt

   The man of sorrows weeps in blood;

   Yet he that hath in anguish knelt

   Is not forsaken by his God.


   4 'Tis midnight; from the heavenly plains

   Is borne the song that angels know;

   Unheard by mortals are the strains

   That sweetly soothe the Saviour's woe.

   2 "Father, remove this bitter cup,

   If such thy sacred will;

   If not, content to drink it up,

   Thy pleasure I fulfill."


   3 Go to the garden, sinner: see

   Those precious drops that flow;

   The heavy load he bore for thee:

   For thee he lies so low.


   4 Then learn of him the cross to bear,

   Thy Father's will obey;

   And, when temptations press thee near,

   Brooded o'er the vale;

   All around was silent,

   Save the night-wind's wail;

   When Christ the man of sorrows,

   In tears, and sweat, and blood,

   Prostrate in the garden,

   Raised his voice to God.


   2 Smitten for offenses

   Which were not his own,

   He, for our transgressions,

   Had to weep alone,

   No friend with words to comfort,

   Nor hand to help was there.

   Humbly bowed in prayer.

   If indeed it may,

   Let this cup of anguish,

   Pass from me, I pray.

   His countenance is all divine,

   Yet grief appears in every line.


   2 He bows beneath the sins of men;

   He cries to God, and cries again,

   In sad Gethsemane:

   He lifts his mournful eyes above--

   "My Father, can this cup remove?"


   3 With gentle resignation still,

   He yielded to his Father's will

   In sad Gethsemane;

   "Behold me here, thine only Son;

   And, Father, let thy will be done."


   4 The Father heard; and angels, there,

   Sustained the Son of God in prayer,

   In sad Gethsemane:

   He drank the dreadful cup of pain--

   Then rose to life and joy again.


   5 When storms of sorrow round us sweep,

   And scenes of anguish make us weep,

   Agony in the garden.

   Mrs. Hemans.


   He knelt; the Saviour knelt and prayed,

   When but his Father's eye

   Looked, through the lonely garden shade,

   On that dread agony;

   The Lord of high and heavenly birth

   Was bowed with sorrow unto death.


   2 The sun went down in fearful hour;

   The heavens might well grow dim,

   When this mortality had power

   Thus to o'ershadow him;

   That he who came to save might know

   The very depths of human woe.


   3 He knew them all--the doubt, the strife,

   The faint, perplexing dread;

   The mists that hang o'er parting life

   All darkened round his head;

   And the Deliverer knelt to pray;

   Yet passed it not, that cup, away.


   4 It passed not, though the stormy wave

   Had sunk beneath his tread;

   It passed not, though to him the grave

   Had yielded up its dead;

   But there was sent him, from on high,

   A gift of strength, for man to die.


   5 And was his mortal hour beset

   With anguish and dismay?

   How may we meet our conflict yet

   In the dark, narrow way?

   How, but through him that path who trod:

   "Save, or we perish, Son of God."

   Among the mountain trees,

   The winds were whispering low,

   And night's ten thousand harmonies

   Were harmonies of woe;

   A voice of grief was on the gale,

   It came from Cedron's gloomy vale.


   2 It was the Saviour's prayer

   That on the silence broke,

   Imploring strength from heaven to bear

   The sin-avenging stroke,

   As in Gethsemane he knelt,

   And pangs unknown his bosom felt.


   3 The fitful starlight shone

   In dim and misty gleams,

   Deep was his agonizing groan,

   And large the vital streams

   That trickled to the dewy sod,

   While Jesus raised his voice to God.


   4 The chosen three that staid,

   Their nightly watch to keep,

   Left him through sorrows deep to wade,

   And gave themselves to sleep:

   Meekly and sad he prayed alone;

   Strangely forgotten by his own.


   5 Along the streamlet's bank

   The reckless traitor came,

   And heavy on his bosom sank

   The load of guilt and shame;

   Yet unto them that waited nigh

   He gave the Lamb of God to die.


   6 Among the mountain trees

   The winds were whispering low,

   And night's ten thousand harmonies

   A bitter and heart-rending cry:

   My Saviour! every mournful word

   Bespeaks thy soul's deep agony.


   2 A horror of great darkness fell

   On thee, thou spotless holy One!

   And all the swarming hosts of hell

   Conspired to tempt God's only Son.


   3 The scourge, the thorns, the deep disgrace--

   These thou couldst bear, nor once repine;

   But when Jehovah vailed his face,

   Unutterable pangs were thine.


   4 Let the dumb world its silence break;

   Let pealing anthems rend the sky;

   Awake, my sluggish soul, awake!

   He died, that we might never die.


   5 Lord! on thy cross I fix mine eye;

   2 Behold the Man! by all condemned,

   Assaulted by a host of foes;

   His person and his claims contemned:

   A Man of suffering and of woes.


   3 Behold the Man! he stands alone,

   His foes are ready to devour;

   Not one of all his friends will own

   Their Master in this trying hour.


   4 Behold the Man! though scorned below,

   He bears the greatest name above;

   The angels at his footstool bow,

   And all his royal claims approve.

   Lo! Salem's daughters weep around!

   A solemn darkness vails the skies,

   A sudden trembling shakes the ground.


   2 Here's love and grief beyond degree!

   The Lord of glory dies for men!

   But, lo! what sudden joys we see--

   Jesus the dead revives again!


   3 The rising Lord forsakes the tomb!

   (The tomb in vain forbids his rise!)

   Cherubic legions guard him home,

   And shout him welcome to the skies!


   4 Break off your tears, you saints, and tell

   How high our great Deliverer reigns;

   Sing how he spoiled the hosts of hell,

   And led the monster Death in chains.


   5 Say, "Live for ever, wondrous King!

   Born to redeem, and strong to save!"

   Then ask the monster, "Where's thy sting?

   And where's thy victory, boasting grave?"

   The Sovereign of the skies,

   Stoop down to wretchedness and dust

   That guilty man might rise?


   2 Yes, the Redeemer left his throne,

   His radiant throne on high;

   Surpassing mercy! love unknown!

   To suffer, bleed, and die.


   3 He took the dying rebel's place,

   And suffered in our stead;

   For sinful man, O wondrous grace!

   For sinful man he bled!

   By this are sinners saved from hell,

   He conquered when he fell:

   'Tis finished, said his dying breath,

   And shook the gates of hell.


   2 'Tis finished, our Immanuel cries,

   The dreadful work is done;

   Hence shall his sovereign throne arise,

   His kingdom is begun.


   3 His cross a sure foundation laid

   For glory and renown,

   When through the regions of the dead

   Behold the Saviour of mankind

   Nailed to the shameful tree!

   How vast the love that him inclined

   To bleed and die for me!


   2 Hark! how he groans, while nature shakes,

   And earth's strong pillars bend!

   The temple's vail asunder breaks,

   The solid marbles rend.


   3 'Tis finished! now the ransom's paid,

   "Receive my soul!" he cries:

   See--how he bows his sacred head!

   He bows his head and dies!


   4 But soon from death he'll rise again,

   And in full glory shine;

   O Lamb of God! was ever pain--

   Was ever love like thine?

   And groaned, and bled, and died,

   He looked with pity on a wretch

   That languished by his side.


   2 The dying thief in Jesus saw

   A majesty divine;

   While scoffing Jews around him stood,

   And asked him for a sign!


   3 The kingdom, Lord, is thine, he said;

   'Tis thine o'er men to reign:

   Thy wondrous works thy lordship prove,

   These pains thy love proclaim:


   4 Honors divine await thee soon,

   A scepter and a crown:

   With shame thy foes shall yet behold

   Thee seated on a throne.


   5 Then, gracious Lord, remember me!

   Is not forgiveness thine?

   My crimes have brought me to thy side--

   Thy love brought thee to mine!


   6 His prayer the dying Jesus hears,

   And instantly replies,

   To-day your parting soul shall be

   With me in paradise.

   2 On me, as thou art dying,

   O, turn thy pitying eye;

   To thee for mercy crying,

   Before thy cross I lie.

   Thine, thine the bitter passion;

   Thy pain is all for me;

   Mine, mine the deep transgression;

   My sins are all on thee.


   3 What language can I borrow

   To praise thee, heavenly Friend,

   For all this dying sorrow,

   Of all my woes the end?

   O, can I leave thee ever?

   Then do not thou leave me;

   Lord, let me never, never

   Outlive my love to thee.


   4 Be near when I am dying;

   Then close beside me stand;

   Let me, while faint and sighing,

   Lean calmly on thy hand:

   These eyes, new faith receiving,

   From thee shall never move,

   For he who dies believing,

   Dies safely--in thy love.

   The Son of Man they did betray;

   He was condemned, and led away,

   Think, O my soul, on that dread day,

   Look on Mount Calvary;

   Behold him, lamb-like, led along

   Surrounded by a wicked throng,

   Accused by every lying tongue,

   And then the Lamb of God they hung

   Upon the shameful tree.


   2 Now, hung between the earth and skies,

   Behold! in agony he dies;

   O sinners, hear his mournful cries,

   Come, see his torturing pain!

   The morning sun withdrew his light,

   Blushed, and refused to view the sight,

   The azure clothed in robes of night,

   All nature mourned, and stood affright,

   When Christ the Lord was slain.


   3 All glory be to God on high,

   Who reigns enthroned above the sky;

   Who sent his Son to bleed and die;

   Glory to him be given:

   While heaven above his praise resounds,

   O Zion, sing--his grace abounds;

   In flaming love that knows no bounds,

   Shall rise and draw immortal breath.


   3 Our surety freed declares us free,

   For whose offenses he was seized:

   Unseals his eyes to sleep no more;

   And ever lives their cause to plead,

   Hasted at the early dawn;

   For a while she lingering stood,

   Filled with sorrow and surprise;

   Trembling, while a crystal flood

   Issued from her weeping eyes.


   2 Jesus who is always near,

   Though too often unperceived,

   Came her drooping heart to cheer,

   Kindly asking why she grieved:

   Though at first she knew him not,

   When he called her by her name,

   She her heavy griefs forgot,

   For she found him still the same.


   3 And her sorrows, quickly fled,

   When she heard his welcome voice;

   Christ had risen from the dead,

   Now he bids her heart rejoice:

   What a change his word can make--

   Turning darkness into day;

   You who weep for Jesus' sake,

   He will wipe your tears away.

   And see immortality's light

   Arise on the shades of the tomb.

   When these aching heartstrings shall break,

   When death shall extinguish these eyes,

   And moisten with dew the pale cheek.

   Psalm 47:5.

   Arise, ye people, and adore,

   Exulting strike the chord;

   Let all the earth, from shore to shore,

   Confess th' almighty Lord.


   2 Glad shouts aloud--wide echoing round,

   Th' ascending Lord proclaim;

   The angelic choir respond the sound,

   And shake creation's frame.


   3 They sing of death and hell o'erthrown

   In that triumphant hour;

   And God exalts his conquering Son

   To his right hand of power.


   4 O shout, ye people, and adore,

   Exulting strike the chord;

   Let all the earth, from shore to shore,

   Thou, who didst stoop below

   To drain the cup of woe,

   And wear the form of frail mortality,

   Thy blesséd labors done,

   Thy crown of victory won,

   Hast passed from earth--passed to thy home on high.


   2 It was no path of flowers,

   Through this dark world of ours,

   Belovéd of the Father! thou didst tread;

   And shall we in dismay

   Shrink from the narrow way,

   When clouds and darkness are around it spread.


   3 O thou who art our Life,

   Be with us through the strife;

   Thy own meek head with rudest storms was bowed!

   Raise thou our eyes above

   To see a Father's love

   Beam, like the bow of promise, through the cloud.


   4 E'en through the awful gloom

   Which hovers o'er the tomb,

   That light of love our guiding star shall be;

   Our spirits shall not dread

   The shadowy way to tread,

   Friend, Guardian, Saviour! which doth lead to thee.

   3 He in the days of feeble flesh,

   Poured out his cries and tears;

   And in his measure feels afresh

   What every member bears.


   4 Then let our humble faith address

   His mercy and his power;

   We shall obtain delivering grace

   In each distressing hour.

   The bright and morning star.
   Rev. 22:16.

   Spirit of the Psalms.


   Bright was the guiding star that led,

   With mild, benignant ray,

   The Gentiles to the lowly shed

   Where the Redeemer lay.


   2 But, lo! a brighter, clearer light

   Now points to his abode;

   It shines through sin and sorrow's night

   To guide us to our God.


   3 O haste to follow where it leads;

   The gracious call obey,

   Be rugged wilds or flowery meads

   The Christian's destined way.


   4 O gladly tread the narrow path

   While light and grace are given:

   Who meekly follow Christ on earth,

   Shall reign with him in heaven.

   Come, you that love the Saviour's name,

   And joy to make it known;

   The Sovereign of your heart proclaim,

   And bow before his throne.


   2 Behold your King, your Saviour, crowned

   With glories all divine;

   And tell the wondering nations round

   How bright these glories shine.


   3 Infinite power and boundless grace

   In him unite their rays;

   You that have seen his lovely face,

   Can you forbear his praise?


   4 When in the earthly courts we view

   The beauties of our King,

   We long to love as angels do,

   And wish like them to sing.


   5 And shall we long and wish in vain?

   Lord, teach our songs to rise!

   Thy love can animate our strain,

   And bid it reach the skies.


   6 O for the day, the glorious day!

   When heaven and earth shall raise,

   With all their powers, the raptured lay,

   To celebrate thy praise.

   In mercy to me speak;

   In thee, my Priest, will I rejoice,

   Jesus, in thee our eyes behold

   A thousand glories more

   Than the rich gems and polished gold

   The sons of Aaron wore.


   2 They first their own burnt-offerings brought

   To purge themselves from sin:

   Thy life was pure, without a spot,

   And all thy nature clean.


   3 Fresh blood, as constant as the day,

   Was on their altar spilt;

   But thy one offering takes away

   For ever all our guilt.


   4 Their priesthood ran through several hands,

   For mortal was their race;

   Thy never-changing office stands

   Eternal as thy days.


   5 Once, in the circuit of a year,

   With blood, but not his own,

   Aaron with the vail appeared

   Before the golden throne;


   6 But Christ, with his own precious blood,

   Ascends above the skies,

   And in the presence of our God

   Shows his own sacrifice.


   7 Jesus, the King of glory, reigns

   On Zion's holy hill;

   Looks like a lamb that had been slain,

   And wears his priesthood still.

   2 How dreadful was the hour

   When God our wanderings laid,

   And did at once his vengeance pour

   Upon the Shepherd's head.


   3 How glorious was the grace

   When Christ sustained the stroke!

   His life and blood the Shepherd pays,

   A ransom for the flock.


   4 But God hath raised his head

   O'er all the sons of men,

   And made him see a numerous seed

   To recompense his pain.

   Turner, varied.


   Beyond the starry skies,

   Far as th' eternal hills,

   Yon heaven of heavens, with living light,

   Our great Redeemer fills.


   2 Around him angels fair,

   In countless armies shine;

   And ever, in exalted lays,

   They offer songs divine.


   3 "Hail, Prince of life!" they cry,

   "Whose unexampled love

   Moved thee to quit those glorious realms

   And royalties above."


   4 And when he stooped to earth,

   And suffered rude disdain,

   They cast their honors at his feet,

   And waited in his train.


   5 They saw him on the cross,

   While darkness vailed the skies;

   And when he burst the gates of death,

   They saw the Conqueror rise.


   6 They thronged his chariot wheels,

   And bore him to his throne;

   Then swept their golden harps and sung--

   "The glorious work is done."

   Sing of Jesus, sing for ever

   Of the love that changes never!

   Who, or what, from him can sever

   Those he makes his own?


   2 With his blood the Lord hath bought them,

   When they knew him not, he sought them,

   And from all their wanderings brought them;

   His the praise alone.


   3 Through the desert Jesus leads them,

   With the bread of heaven he feeds them,

   And through all their way he speeds them

   To their home above.


   4 There they see the Lord who bought them,

   Him who came from heaven and sought them,

   Him who by his Spirit taught them,

   Him they serve and love.

   Rock of ages, cleft for me,

   Let me hide myself in thee;

   Let the water and the blood,

   From thy riven side which flowed,

   Be of sin the double cure;

   Cleanse me from its guilt and power.


   2 Not the labor of my hands

   Can fulfill the law's demands;

   Could my zeal no respite know,

   Could my tears for ever flow,

   All for sin could not atone;

   Thou must save and thou alone.


   3 Nothing in my hand I bring,

   Simply to thy cross I cling;

   Naked, come to thee for dress;

   Helpless, look to thee for grace;

   Foul, I to the fountain fly;

   Wash me, Saviour, or I die.


   4 While I draw this fleeting breath,

   When my heart-strings break in death,

   When I soar to worlds unknown,

   See thee on thy judgment throne,

   Rock of ages, cleft for me,

   Let me hide myself in thee.

   While the tempest still is high;

   Hide me, O my Saviour, hide,

   Till the storm of life is past,

   Safe into the haven guide,

   O receive my soul at last.


   2 Other refuge have I none,

   Hangs my helpless soul on thee!

   Leave, O leave me not alone,

   Still support and comfort me:

   All my trust on thee is stayed,

   All my help from thee I bring,

   Cover my defenseless head

   With the shadow of thy wing.


   3 Thou, O Christ, art all I want,

   Boundless love in thee I find;

   Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,

   Heal the sick, and lead the blind.

   Just and holy is thy name,

   Prince of Peace and Righteousness;

   Most unworthy, Lord, I am,

   Thou art full of love and grace.


   4 Plenteous grace with thee is found,

   Grace to pardon all my sins;

   Let the healing streams abound,

   Make and keep me pure within.

   Thou of life the fountain art,

   Freely let me take of thee;

   Spring thou up within my heart,

   And look to the Rock that is higher than I.

   The Christian hanner! dread no loss

   Where that broad ensign floats unrolled;

   But let the fair and sacred cross

   Blaze out from every radiant fold:

   Stern foes arise, a countless throng,

   Loud as the storms of Kara's sea,

   But though the strife be fierce and long,

   That cross shall wave in victory.


   2 Sound the shrill trumpet, sound, and call

   The people of the mighty King,

   And bid them keep that standard all

   In martial thousands gathering:

   Let them come forth from every clime

   That lies beneath the circling sun,

   Various, as flowers in that sweet clime

   Where flowers are, in heart, but one.


   3 Soldiers of heaven! take sword and shield,

   Look up to him who rules on high,

   And forward to the glorious field,

   Where noble martyrs bleed and die;

   Press onward, scorning flight or fear,

   As deep waves burst on Norway's coast,

   And let the startled nations hear

   The war-shout of the Christian host.


   4 Lift up the banner: rest no more,

   Nor let this righteous warfare cease,

   Till man's last tribe shall bow before

   The Lord of lords--the Prince of Peace:

   Go! bear it forth, ye strong and brave;

   Let not those bright folds once be furled,

   Till that high sun shall see them wave

   Above a blest but conquered world.

   And vainly seek to comprehend

   Shall see, from far, the glorious sight,

   And nations, crowding to be born,

   Baptize their spirits in its light.


   4 Fling out the banner! sin-sick souls,

   That sink and perish in the strife,

   Shall touch in faith its radiant hem,

   And spring immortal into life.

   The power to kill, the power to save,

   Furnished their tongues with wondrous words,

   Instead of shields, and spears, and swords.


   3 Thus armed, he sent the champions forth,

   From east to west, from south to north;

   Go, and assert your Saviour's cause--

   Go, spread the mystery of the cross!

   Of what almighty force they are

   To make our stubborn passions bow,

   And lay the proudest rebel low!


   5 The Greeks and Jews, the learned and rude,

   Watts.


   Life is the time to serve the Lord,

   The time t' insure the great reward;

   And while the lamp holds out to burn,

   O hasten, sinner, to return!


   2 Life is the hour that God has given

   To 'scape from hell and fly to heaven,

   The day of grace, when mortals may

   Secure the blessings of the day.


   3 The living know that they must die,

   Beneath the clods their dust must lie;

   Then have no share in all that's done

   Beneath the circle of the sun.


   4 Then what my thoughts design to do,

   My hands, with all your might pursue:

   Since no device nor work is found,

   Nor faith, nor hope, beneath the ground.


   5 There are no acts of pardon passed

   In the cold grave to which we haste;

   O may we all receive thy grace,

   And see with joy thy smiling face.

   O, do no longer stay away,

   For now your Saviour calls,

   And the gospel sounds the jubilee;

   O, do no longer stay away.


   2 Hark! 'tis the Saviour's gracious call,

   The invitation is to all;

   Come, all the world--come, sinner, thou--

   All things in Christ are ready now.


   3 Come, all you souls by sin oppressed,

   You weary wanderers after rest;

   You poor and maimed, and halt and blind,

   In Christ a hearty welcome find.


   4 The message, as from God, receive--

   You all may come to Christ and live;

   O let his love your hearts constrain,

   Nor suffer him to call in vain.


   5 This is the time--no more delay;

   The Saviour calls you all to-day:

   O may his call effectual prove!

   Accept the offers of his love!

   Let every mortal ear attend,

   And every heart rejoice;

   The trumpet of the gospel sounds

   With an inviting voice:


   2 Ho! all you hungry, starving souls,

   Who feed upon the wind,

   And vainly strive with earthly toys

   To fill an empty mind.


   3 Eternal wisdom has prepared

   A soul-reviving feast,

   And bids your longing appetites

   The rich provision taste.


   4 Ho! you that pant for living streams,

   And pine away and die,

   Here may you quench your raging thirst

   With springs that never dry.


   5 Rivers of love and mercy here

   In a rich ocean join;

   Salvation in abundance flows,

   Like floods of milk and wine.


   6 Great God! the treasures of thy love

   Are everlasting mines,

   Deep as our helpless miseries are,

   And boundless as our sins.


   7 The happy gates of gospel grace

   His gospel and his heart have room

   3 His doctrine is almighty love;

   There's virtue in his name

   To turn a raven to a dove,

   A lion to a lamb.


   4 Come, then, accept the offered grace,

   And make no more delay;

   His love will all your guilt efface,

   And soothe your fears away.

   3 Humbly I'll bow at his command,

   And there my guilt confess;

   I'll own I am a wretch undone,

   Without his sovereign grace.


   4 Surely he will accept my plea,

   For he has bid me come;

   Forthwith I'll rise, and to him flee,

   That trembles at his feet.

   Millions more are on their journey,

   Yet there's room for millions more;


   3 Come on board, O ship for glory,

   Be in haste, make up your mind,

   For our vessel's weighing anchor--

   You will soon be left behind.


   4 You have kindred over yonder,

   On that bright and happy shore;

   By and by we'll swell the number;

   When the toils of life are o'er.


   5 Spread your sails, while heavenly breezes

   Gently waft our vessel on;

   All on board are sweetly singing;

   Free salvation is the song.


   6 When we all are safely landed,

   Over on the shining shore,

   We will walk about the city,

   And we'll sing for evermore.


   All the storms of life are over,

   Landed in the port of glory:

   Now no more on the ocean sailing--

   Safe at home beyond the tide.

   Sinners, will you scorn the message

   Sent in mercy from above?

   Every sentence, O how tender!

   Every line is full of love;

   Listen to it;

   Every line is full of love.

   News from Zion's King proclaim;

   "Pardon to each rebel sinner;

   Free forgiveness in his name:"

   O how gracious!

   "Free forgiveness in his name."


   3 Will you not receive the message--

   Listen to the joyful word;

   And embrace the news of pardon

   Offered to you by the Lord?

   Can you slight it--

   Offered to you by the Lord?


   4 O ye angels, hovering round us,

   Waiting spirits, speed your way,

   Haste ye to the court of heaven;

   Listen to the gospel, telling

   How the Lord was crucified;

   How upon the cross he suffered,

   When he bowed his head and died,

   All for sinners!

   Come, then, to his bleeding side.


   2 Listen to the gospel calling!

   Hear, O sinner, and obey!

   Come to Jesus, he will save you,

   Now, no longer stay away;

   He invites you;

   Sinner, then, make no delay,


   3 Listen to the gospel pleading,

   Hasten, sinner, to arise;

   Come and cast yourself on Jesus,

   He to none his love denies;

   Trust him freely,

   Wait no longer; now be wise.


   4 Listen to the gospel blessing

   All who trust the Saviour's love;

   And to those who now obey him,

   Bringing pardon from above;

   Careless sinner,

   Will you still refuse to move?


   5 Listen to the gospel warning;

   All who stay away must die;

   Come, then, while all things are ready,

   Mercy calls you from on high;

   Come and welcome,

   Hear, O hear the Saviour cry!

   Ere the hand of Justice falls:

   Trust in Jesus;

   'Tis the voice of mercy calls.


   2 Haste, O sinner! to the Saviour--

   Seek his mercy while you may;

   Before you further go;

   Will you sport upon the brink

   Of everlasting woe!

   On the verge of ruin stop--

   Now the friendly warning take--

   Stay your footsteps--ere you drop

   Into the burning lake.


   2 Say, have you an arm like God,

   That you his will oppose?

   Fear ye not that iron rod

   With which he breaks his foes?

   Can you stand in that dread day

   Which his justice shall proclaim--

   When the earth shall melt away

   Like wax before the flame?


   3 Ghastly death will quickly come,

   And drag you to his bar;

   Then, to hear your awful doom,

   Will fill you with despair!

   All your sins will round you crowd--

   You shall mark their crimson dye--

   Each for vengeance crying loud;

   And what can you reply?


   4 Though your heart were made of steel,

   Your forehead lined with brass,

   God at length will make you feel--

   He will not let you pass:

   Sinners then in vain will call--

   Those who now despise his grace--

   "Rocks and mountains, on us fall,

   And hide us from his face."

   For debts to justice due,

   Ransomed, but not with gold,

   He gave himself for you!

   O, how can you question, since now you believe?

   Since sin is your burden, why will you not come?

   4 In riches, in pleasure, what can you obtain,

   To soothe your affliction, or banish your pain;

   To bear up your spirit when summoned to die,

   Or waft you to mansions of glory on high?

   Soon shall I end my trials here;

   Leave sin and sorrow, death and pain;

   To live is Christ, to die is gain.

   God calling yet.

   From the German.


   God calling yet! shall I not hear?

   Earth's pleasures shall I still hold dear?

   Shall life's swift passing years all fly,

   And still my soul in slumbers lie?


   2 God calling yet! shall I not rise?

   Can I his loving voice despise,

   And basely his kind care repay?

   He calls me still: can I delay?


   3 God calling yet! and shall he knock,

   And I my heart the closer lock?

   He still is waiting to receive,

   And shall I dare his Spirit grieve?


   4 God calling yet! and shall I give

   No heed, but still in bondage live?

   I wait, but he does not forsake;

   He calls me still! my heart, awake!


   5 God calling yet! I can not stay;

   My heart I yield without delay;

   Vain world, farewell! from thee I part;

   The voice of God hath reached my heart.

   Now to the Lord, who makes us know

   The wonders of his dying love,

   Be humble honors paid below,

   And strains of nobler praise above.


   2 'Twas he who cleansed us from our sins,

   And washed us in his precious blood;

   'Tis he who makes us priests and kings,

   And brings us, rebels, near to God.


   3 To Jesus, our atoning Priest,

   To Jesus, our eternal King,

   Be everlasting power confessed;

   Let every tongue his glory sing.


   4 Behold, on flying clouds he comes,

   And every eye shall see him move;

   Though with our sins we pierced him once,

   Now he displays his pardoning love.


   5 The unbelieving world shall wail,

   While we rejoice to see the day:

   Come, Lord, nor let thy promise fail,

   Nor let the chariot long delay.

   With many a conflict, many a doubt,

   With fears within, and foes without--

   4 Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;

   Sight, riches, healing of the mind,

   Yea, all I need, in thee to find,

   O Lamb of God, I come.


   5 Just as I am, thou wilt receive,

   Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve,

   Because thy promise I believe--

   O Lamb of God, I come.

   Amid the wonders of thy love,

   Sweet hope revives my drooping heart,

   2 For mortal crimes a sacrifice,

   The Lord of life, the Saviour dies;

   What love! what mercy! how divine!

   May not a sinner trust in thee?


   2 My crimes, though great, can not surpass

   The power and glory of thy grace;

   Great God, thy nature hath no bound;

   So let thy pardoning love be found.


   3 O, wash my soul from every sin,

   And make my guilty conscience clean;

   Here, on my heart, the burden lies,

   And past offenses pain my eyes.


   4 My lips, with shame, my sins confess,

   Against thy law, against thy grace;

   Lord, should thy judgment grow severe,

   I am condemned, but thou art clear.


   5 Should sudden vengeance seize my breath,

   I must pronounce thee just in death;

   And if my soul were sent to hell,

   Thy righteous law approves it well.


   6 Yet save a trembling sinner, Lord,

   Whose hope, still hovering round thy word,

   Would light on some sweet promise there,

   Some sure support against despair.

   A broken heart, my God, my King,

   Is all the sacrifice I bring;

   The God of grace will ne'er despise

   A broken heart for sacrifice.


   2 My soul lies humbled in the dust,

   And owns thy dreadful sentence just;

   Look down, O Lord, with pitying eye,

   And save the soul condemned to die.


   3 Then will I teach the world thy ways;

   Sinners shall learn thy sovereign grace;

   I'll lead them to my Saviour's blood,

   And they shall praise a pardoning God.

   Which spoke the angel nigh, who gave

   Its virtue to that holy spring,

   With patience and with hope endued,

   Were seen the gathered multitude.


   2 Bethesda's pool has lost its power!

   No angel, by his glad descent

   Dispenses that diviner dower

   Which with its healing waters went;

   But he, whose word surpassed its wave,

   Is still omnipotent to save.


   3 Saviour! thy love is still the same

   As when that healing word was spoke;

   Still in thine all-redeeming name

   Dwells power to burst the strongest yoke!

   The Star of Bethlehem.

   H. K. White.


   When marshaled on the nightly plain,

   The glittering host bestud the sky,

   One star alone, of all the train,

   Can fix the sinner's wandering eye.


   2 Hark! hark! to God the chorus breaks,

   From every host, from every gem;

   But one alone the Saviour speaks--

   It is the Star of Bethlehem.


   3 Once on the raging seas I rode;

   The storm was loud, the night was dark,

   The ocean yawned, and rudely blowed

   The wind that tossed my foundering bark.


   4 Deep horror then my vitals froze;

   Death-struck, I ceased the tide to stem;

   When suddenly a star arose--

   It was the Star of Bethlehem.


   5 It was my guide, my light, my all;

   It bade my dark forebodings cease;

   And through the storm and danger's thrall,

   It led me to the port of peace.


   6 Now safely moored, my perils o'er,

   I'll sing, first in night's diadem,

   For ever, and for evermore,

   The Star--the Star of Bethlehem.

   Power of faith.

   Watts.


   Faith adds new charms to earthly bliss,

   And saves us from its snares;

   It yields support in all our toils,

   And softens all our cares.


   2 The wounded conscience knows its power

   The healing balm to give;

   That balm the saddest heart can cheer,

   And make the dying live.


   3 Unvailing wide the heavenly world,

   Where endless pleasures reign,

   It bids us seek our portion there,

   Nor bids us seek in vain.


   4 There, still unshaken, would we rest

   Till this frail body dies;

   And then, on faith's triumphant wing,

   To endless glory rise.

   Increase our faith.
   Luke 17:5.

   Bath Coll.


   O for a faith that will not shrink,

   Though pressed by every foe,

   That will not tremble on the brink

   Of any earthly woe!


   2 That will not murmur nor complain

   Beneath the chastening rod,

   But, in the hour of grief or pain,

   Will lean upon its God;


   3 A faith that shines more bright and clear

   When tempests rage without;

   That, when in danger, knows no fear,

   In darkness feels no doubt;


   4 That bears, unmoved, the world's dread frown,

   Nor heeds its scornful smile;

   That seas of trouble can not drown,

   Nor Satan's arts beguile.


   5 A faith that keeps the narrow way

   Till life's last hour is fled,

   And with a pure and heavenly ray,

   Lights up a dying bed.


   6 Lord, give us such a faith as this;

   And then, whate'er may come,

   We'll taste, e'en here, the hallowed bliss

   Of an eternal home.

   Watts.


   Mistaken souls, that dream of heaven,

   And make their empty boast

   While they are slaves to lust!


   2 How vain are fancy's airy flights,

   If faith be cold and dead!

   None but a living power unites

   To Christ, the living Head.


   3 'Tis faith that purifies the heart;

   'Tis faith that works by love;

   That bids all sinful joys depart,

   And lifts the thoughts above.


   4 Faith must obey our Father's will,

   As well as trust his grace;

   A pardoning God requires us still

   To walk in all his ways.


   5 This faith shall every fear control

   By its celestial power,

   With holy triumph fill the soul

   In death's approaching hour.

   3 Our hearts, if God we seek to know,

   Shall know him and rejoice;

   His coming like the morn shall be;

   Like morning songs his voice.

   Sure upon the earth is none

   Can more weary be than I.


   3 In the ark the weary dove

   Found a welcome resting-place;

   Thus my spirit longs to prove

   Rest in Christ, the Ark of grace;

   Tempest-tossed I long have been,

   And the flood increases fast;

   Open, Lord, and take me in,

   Till the storm be overpast!

   Exodus 14:15.


   When we can not see our way,

   Let us trust, and still obey;

   He who bids us forward go,

   Can not fail the way to show.


   2 Though the sea be deep and wide,

   Though a passage seem denied;

   Fearless let us still proceed,

   Since the Lord vouchsafes to lead.


   3 Though it seems the gloom of night,

   Though we see no ray of light;

   Since the Lord himself is there,

   'Tis not meet that we should fear.


   4 Night with him is never night;

   Where he is, there all is light;

   When he calls us, why delay?

   They are happy who obey.


   5 Be it ours, then, while we're here,

   Him to follow without fear;

   Where he calls us, there to go,

   What he bids us, that to do.

   O holy Saviour! Friend unseen,

   Since on thine arm thou bidd'st me lean,

   Help me, throughout life's changing scene,

   By faith to cling to thee!


   2 Blest with this fellowship divine,

   Take what thou wilt, I'll not repine;

   For, as the branches to the vine,

   My soul would cling to thee.


   3 Though far from home, fatigued, oppressed,

   Here have I found a place of rest;

   An exile still, yet not unblest,

   Because I cling to thee.


   4 What though the world deceitful prove,

   And earthly friends and hopes remove;

   With patient, uncomplaining love,

   Still would I cling to thee.


   5 Though oft I seem to tread alone

   Life's dreary waste, with thorns o'ergrown,

   Thy voice of love in gentlest tone,

   Still whispers, "Cling to me!"


   6 Though faith and hope are often tried,

   I ask not, need not aught beside;

   So safe, so calm, so satisfied,

   The soul that clings to thee!

   Ashamed of Jesus.

   Jesus, and shall it ever be,

   A mortal man ashamed of thee:

   Ashamed of thee, whom angels praise,

   Whose glory shines through endless days.


   2 Ashamed of Jesus! Sooner far

   Let evening blush to own a star!

   He sheds the beams of light divine

   O'er this benighted soul of mine.


   3 Ashamed of Jesus! Just as soon

   Let morning be ashamed of noon;

   'Tis midnight with my soul, till he,

   Bright Morning Star, bid darkness flee.


   4 Ashamed of Jesus! that dear friend,

   On whom my hopes of heaven depend!

   No! when I blush, be this my shame,

   That I no more revere his name.


   5 Ashamed of Jesus! Yes, I may,

   When I've no guilt to wash away,

   No tear to wipe, no good to crave,

   No fears to quell, no soul to save.


   6 Till then--nor is my boasting vain--

   Till then I'll boast a Saviour slain!

   And O! may this my glory be,

   That Christ is not ashamed of me!


   7 His institutions would I prize,

   Take up my cross, the shame despise--

   Dare to defend his noble cause,

   And yield obedience to his laws.

   Who loved our race ere time began,

   Who vailed his Godhead in our clay,

   And in an humble manger lay.


   2 To Jordan's stream the Spirit led,

   To mark the path his saints should tread;

   With joy they trace the sacred way,

   To see the place where Jesus lay.


   3 Baptized by John in Jordan's wave,

   The Saviour left his watery grave;

   Heaven owned the deed, approved the way,

   Come tread his steps, and learn of him;

   The great Redeemer we adore,

   Who came the lost to seek and save--

   Went humbly down from Jordan's shore

   To find a tomb beneath its wave!


   2 With thee into thy watery tomb,

   Lord, 'tis our glory to descend;

   'Tis wondrous grace that gives us room

   To share the grave of such a friend.


   3 Yet, as the yielding waves give way

   To let us see the light again,

   So, on the resurrection day,

   The bands of death proved weak and vain.


   4 Thus, when thou shalt again appear,

   The gates of death shall open wide:

   Our dust thy mighty voice shall hear,

   And rise and triumph at thy side.

   The path their great Redeemer trod:

   And follow through his liquid grave

   The meek, the lowly Son of God!


   2 Here they renounce their former deeds,

   And to a heavenly life aspire,

   Their rags for glorious robes exchanged,

   They shine in clean and bright attire.


   3 O sacred rite, by thee the name

   Of Jesus we to own begin;

   This is our resurrection pledge,

   Pledge of the pardon of our sin.


   4 Glory to God on high be given,

   In concert join their loud Amen.

   For us despised the shame.


   3 To his command let us submit

   Ourselves without delay;

   Our lives--yea, thousand lives of ours,

   His love can ne'er repay.


   4 Each faithful follower Jesus views

   Was blind, but now I see.


   3 Through many dangers, toils, and snares,

   I have already come;

   'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,

   And grace will lead me home.


   3 The Lord has promised good to me,

   His word my hope secures;

   He will my shield and portion be

   As long as life endures.


   4 Yes, when this heart and flesh shall fail,

   And mortal life shall cease,

   I shall possess within the vail

   A life of joy and peace.

   C. Wesley.


   How happy every child of grace,

   Who knows his sins forgiven!

   This earth, he cries, is not my place--

   I seek my home in heaven.


   2 A country far from mortal sight,

   Yet O, by faith I see

   The land of rest, the saint's delight,

   The heaven prepared for me.


   3 O what a blesséd hope is ours!

   While here on earth we stay,

   We more than taste the heavenly powers,

   And antedate that day.


   4 We feel the resurrection near,

   Our life in Christ concealed,

   And with his glorious presence here,

   Our earthen vessels filled.


   5 O, would he all of heaven bestow!

   Then like our Lord we'll rise;

   Our bodies, fully ransomed, go

   To take the glorious prize.


   6 On him with rapture then I'll gaze,

   Who bought the bliss for me,

   And shout and wonder at his grace,

   Through all eternity.

   Grace! 'tis a charming sound,

   2 Grace first contrived the way

   To save rebellious man;

   And all the steps that grace display,

   Which drew the wondrous plan.


   3 Grace led our wandering feet

   To tread the heavenly road;

   And new supplies each hour we meet,

   Blest Saviour! Friend divine!

   Thou source of boundless love!

   The hope of all thy saints on earth,

   The joy of all above!


   2 How can I tell thy worth!

   How make thy glories known!

   No language can thy goodness speak,

   No tongue thy mercies own!


   3 My words can not express

   The sweetness of thy name!

   Nor can my feeble lips declare

   The wonders of thy fame!


   4 Then take my trusting heart,

   I can not give thee more;

   Make rich my soul's deep poverty,

   From thine unwasting store!

   2 Naught else I feel, or hear, or see,

   All bonds of earth I sever;

   3 Like him whose fetters dropped away

   When light shone o'er his prison,

   My soul now touched by mercy's ray,

   How happy are they who their Saviour obey,

   And have laid up their treasures above!

   Tongue can not express the sweet comfort and peace

   Of a soul in its earliest love!


   2 This comfort is mine, since the favor divine

   I have found in the blood of the Lamb:

   Since the truth I believed what a joy I've received,

   What a heaven in Jesus' blest name!


   3 'Tis a heavén below my Redeemer to know,

   And the angels can do nothing more

   Than to fall at his feet, and the story repeat,

   And the lover of sinners adore!


   4 Jesus all the day long is my joy and my song;

   O that all to this refuge may fly!

   He has loved me, I cried, he has suffered and died

   To redeem such a rebel as I!


   5 On the wings of his love I am carried above

   All my sin, and temptation, and pain;

   O why should I grieve, while on him I believe!

   O why should I sorrow again!


   6 O the rapturous hight of that holy delight,

   Which I find in the life-giving blood!

   Of my Saviour possessed, I am perfectly blessed,

   Being filled with the fullness of God!


   7 Now my remnant of days will I spend to his praise

   Who has died me from sin to redeem;

   Whether many or few, all my years are his due;

   They shall all be devoted to him.


   8 What a mercy is this! what a heaven of bliss!

   How unspeakably happy am I!

   Gathered into the fold, with believers enrolled--

   With believers to live and to die!

   Like morning--when her early breeze

   Breaks up the surface of the seas,

   That, in their furrows, dark with night,

   Her hand may sow the seeds of light--


   2 Thy grace can send its breathings o'er

   The spirit dark and lost before;

   And, freshening all its depths, prepare

   For truth divine to enter there.


   3 Till David touched his sacred lyre,

   In silence lay the unbreathing wire;

   But when he swept its chords along,

   Then angels stooped to hear the song.


   4 So sleeps the soul, till thou, O Lord,

   Shall deign to touch its lifeless chord;

   Till, waked by thee, its breath shall rise,

   In music worthy of the skies.

   And every cheering ray depart.


   4 When some kind promise glads my soul,

   Do I not find his healing voice

   The tempest of my fears control,

   And bid my drooping powers rejoice!

   Their emptiness and poverty;

   Treasures of grace to them are given,

   And crowns of joy laid up in heaven.


   2 Blessed are the men of broken heart,

   Who mourn for sin with inward smart;

   The blood of Christ divinely flows,

   A healing balm for all their woes.


   3 Blessed are the souls who thirst for grace,

   Hunger and thirst for righteousness;

   They shall be well supplied, and fed

   With living streams and living bread.


   4 Blessed are the men of peaceful life,

   Who quench the glowing coals of strife;

   They shall be called the heirs of bliss,

   The sons of God, the God of peace.


   5 Blessed are the sufferers who partake

   Of pain and shame for Jesus' sake;

   Their souls shall triumph in the Lord:

   His robe is of the ethereal dye,

   2 It tells me of a Saviour's love,

   It cheers me through this "little while,"

   Through desert, waste, and wild.

   We ask for peace, O Lord!

   Thy children ask thy peace;

   Not what the world calls rest,

   That toil and care should cease,

   That through bright sunny hours

   Calm life should fleet away,

   And tranquil night should fade

   In smiling day--

   It is not for such peace that we would pray.


   2 We ask for peace, O Lord!

   Yet not to stand secure,

   Girt round with iron pride,

   Contented to endure:

   Crushing the gentle strings,

   That human hearts should know,

   Untouched by others' joys

   Or others' woe;

   Thou, O dear Lord, wilt never teach us so.


   3 We ask thy peace, O Lord!

   Through storm, and fear, and strife,

   To light and guide us on,

   Through a long struggling life:

   While no success or gain

   Shall cheer the desperate fight,

   Or nerve, what the world calls,

   Our wasted might:

   Yet pressing through the darkness to the light.


   4 It is thine own, O Lord!

   Who toil while others sleep,

   Who sow with loving care

   What other hands shall reap:

   They lean on thee entranced

   In calm and perfect rest:

   Would here no longer stay;

   Hope in trouble.

   B. W. Noel.


   When musing sorrow weeps the past,

   And mourns the present pain,

   'Tis sweet to think of peace at last,

   And feel that death is gain.


   2 'Tis not that murmuring thoughts arise,

   And dread a Father's will;

   'Tis not that meek submission flies,

   And would not suffer still.


   3 It is that heaven-born faith surveys

   The path that leads to light,

   And longs her eagle plumes to raise,

   And lose herself in sight.


   4 It is that troubled conscience feels

   The pangs of struggling sin,

   And sees, though far, the hand that heals,

   And ends the strife within.


   5 O, let me wing my hallowed flight

   From earth-born woe and care,

   And soar above these clouds of night,

   My Saviour's bliss to share.

   O there's a better world on high;

   Hope on, thou pious breast;

   Faint not, thou traveler; on the sky

   Thy weary feet shall rest.


   2 Anguish may rend each vital part;

   Poor man, thy strength how frail!

   Yet heaven's own strength shall shield thy heart,

   When flesh and heart shall fail.


   3 Through death's dark vale, of deepest shade,

   Thy feet must surely go;

   Yet there, e'en there, walk undismayed;

   'Tis thy last scene of woe.


   4 Thy God--and with the tenderest hand--

   Shall guard the traveler through;

   "Hail!" shalt thou cry: "hail! promised land!

   And, wilderness, adieu!"


   5 O Father, make our souls thy care,

   And bring us safe to thee;

   Where'er thou art--we ask not where--

   But there 'tis heaven to be.

   Since I can read my title clear

   To mansions in the skies,

   I bid farewell to every fear,

   And wipe my weeping eyes.


   2 Should earth against my soul engage,

   And fiery darts be hurled,

   Then I would smile at Satan's rage,

   And face a frowning world.


   3 Let cares, like a wild deluge, come,

   And storms of sorrow fall,

   May I but safely reach my home,

   My God, my heaven, my all.


   4 There shall I bathe my weary soul

   In seas of heavenly rest;

   And not a wave of trouble roll

   Across my peaceful breast.

   God our only hope.

   Drummond.


   When reft of all, and hopeless care

   Would sink us to the tomb,

   What power shall save us from despair,

   What dissipate the gloom?


   2 No balm that earthly plants distill

   Can soothe the mourner's smart,

   No mortal hand, with lenient skill,

   Bind up the broken heart.


   3 But One alone, who reigns above,

   Our woe to joy can turn,

   And light the lamp of life and love,

   That long has ceased to burn.


   4 Then, O my soul! to that One flee,

   To God thy woes reveal;

   His eye alone thy wounds can see,

   His power alone can heal.

   His hand has been my guide;

   And in his long-experienced care,

   My heart shall still confide.


   3 His grace through all the desert flows,

   An unexhausted stream;

   That grace, on Zion's sacred mount,

   Shall be my endless theme.


   4 Beyond the choicest joys of time,

   Thy courts on earth I love;

   But O! I burn with strong desire

   To view thy house above.


   5 There, joined with all the shining band,

   My soul would thee adore;

   A pillar in thy temple fixed,

   When for eternal worlds we steer,

   And seas are calm, and skies are clear,

   And faith, in lively exercise,

   Sees distant fields of Canaan rise,

   The soul for joy then spreads her wings,

   And loud her lovely sonnet sings,

   Vain world, adieu.


   2 With cheerful hope, her eyes explore

   Each land-mark on the distant shore,

   The trees of life, the pastures green,

   The golden streets, the crystal stream;

   Again for joy she spreads her wings,

   And loud her lovely sonnet sings,

   I'm going home.


   3 The nearer still she draws to land,

   More eager all her powers expand;

   With steady helm, and free bent sail,

   Her anchor drops within the vail;

   And now for joy she folds her wings,

   And her celestial sonnet sings,

   I'm safe at home.

   The world may change from old to new,

   From new to old again;

   Yet hope and heaven, for ever true,

   Within our hearts remain.


   2 Hope leads the child to plant the flower,

   The man to sow the seed;

   Nor leaves fulfillment to her hour--

   But prompts again to deed.


   3 And ere upon the old man's dust

   The grass is seen to wave,

   We look through falling tears, to trust

   Hope's sunshine on the grave.


   4 O, no, it is no flattering lure,

   No fancy weak or fond,

   When hope would bid us rest secure

   In better life beyond.


   5 Nor love, nor shame, nor grief, nor tears,

   Her promise may gainsay;

   The voice divine speaks through our years,

   To cheer us on our way.

   The Rock of Salvation.

   F. S. Key.


   If life's pleasures charm you, give them not your heart,

   Lest the gift ensnare you from your God to part;

   His favor seek, his praises speak;

   Fix here your hope's foundation;

   Serve him, and he will ever be

   The Rock of your Salvation.


   2 If distress befall you, painful though it be,

   Let not grief appall you--to your Saviour flee;

   He ever near, your prayer will hear,

   And calm your perturbation;

   The waves of woe shall ne'er o'erflow

   The Rock of your Salvation.


   3 When earth's prospects fail you, let it not distress,

   Better comforts wait you--Christ will surely bless;

   To Jesus flee--your prop he'll be,

   Your heavenly consolation;

   For griefs below can not o'erthrow

   The Rock of your Salvation.


   4 Dangers may approach you; let them not alarm;

   Christ will ever watch you, and protect from harm,

   He near you stands, with mighty hands

   To ward off each temptation;

   To Jesus fly; he's ever nigh,

   The Rock of your Salvation.


   5 Let not death alarm you, shrink not from his blow;

   For your God shall arm you, and victory bestow,

   For death shall bring to you no sting,

   The grave no desolation:

   'Tis sweet to die with Jesus nigh,

   The Rock of your Salvation.

   Happy the church, thou sacred place,

   The seat of thy Creator's grace!

   Thine holy courts are his abode,

   Thou earthly palace of our God!


   2 Thy walls are strength, and at thy gates

   A guard of heavenly warriors waits;

   Nor shall thy deep foundations move,

   Fixed on his counsels and his love.


   3 Thy foes in vain designs engage;

   Against his throne in vain they rage:

   Like rising waves, with angry roar,

   That dash and die upon the shore.


   4 God is our shield, and God our sun;

   On us he sheds new beams of grace,

   2 I love her gates, I love the road:

   2 By evil beast, or burning sky,

   Not one in all that flock shall die

   3 For if, unheeding or beguiled,

   In danger's path they roam,

   His pity follows through the wild,

   Washed in the Redeemer's blood,

   Jesus, whom their souls rely on,

   Makes them kings and priests to God:

   'Tis his love his people raises

   With himself to reign as kings;

   And, as priests, his solemn praises

   Each for a thank-offering brings.


   5 Saviour, since of Zion's city,

   I through grace a member am,

   Let the world deride or pity,

   I will glory in thy name:

   Fading is the worldling's treasure,

   All his boasted pomp and show!

   Solid joys and lasting pleasure

   None but Zion's children know.

   The peace which filled thine infant Church of yore,

   Ere lust of power had sown the seeds of strife,

   And quenched the new-born charities of life.


   2 O, never more may different judgments part

   From kindled sympathy a brother's heart!

   But, linked in one, believing thousands kneel,

   And share with each the sacred joy they feel.

   Let concord spread one universal day;

   And faith by love lead all mankind to thee,

   Parent of peace, and Fount of harmony!

   See, from Zion's sacred mountain,

   Streams of living water flow;

   God has opened there a fountain

   That supplies the world below;

   They are blesséd

   Who its sovereign virtues know.


   2 Through ten thousand channels flowing,

   Streams of mercy find their way:

   Life, and health, and joy bestowing,

   Waking beauty from decay.

   O, ye nations,

   Hail the long-expected day.

   All-enriching as it goes,

   Lo! the desert smiles with pleasure,

   Buds and blossoms as the rose;

   Lo! the desert

   Sings for joy where'er it flows.

   The house of the Lord.

   W. Hunter.


   You may sing of the beauty of mountain and dale,

   Of the silvery streamlets and flowers of the vale;

   But the place most delightful this earth can afford,

   Is the place of devotion, the house of the Lord.


   2 You may boast of the sweetness of day's early dawn,

   Of the sky's softening graces when day is just gone;

   But there's no other season or time can compare,

   With the hour of devotion, the season of prayer.


   3 You may value the friendships of youth and of age,

   And select for your comrades the noble and sage;

   But the friends that most cheer me on life's rugged road,

   Are the friends of my Master, the children of God.


   4 You may talk of your prospects, of fame, or of wealth,

   And the hopes that oft flatter the favorites of health;

   But the hope of bright glory, of heavenly bliss--

   Take away every other, and give me but this.


   5 Ever hail, blessed temple, abode of my Lord!

   I will turn to thee often, to hear from his word;

   I will walk to thine altar with those that I love,

   And rejoice in the prospects revealed from above.

   2 Heir of the same inheritance,

   Child of the self-same God,

   He hath but stumbled in the path

   We have in weakness trod.


   3 Speak gently to the erring ones!

   We yet may lead them back,

   With holy words and tones of love,

   From misery's thorny track.


   4 Forget not, brother, thou hast sinned,

   And sinful yet may be;

   Deal gently with the erring heart,

   As God hath dealt with thee.

   His throne of grace is near;

   And when they plead his love and power,

   He stands engaged to hear.


   3 His presence sweetens all our cares,

   And makes our burdens light;

   A word from him dispels our fears,

   And gilds the gloom of night.


   4 Lord, we expect to suffer here,

   Nor would we dare repine;

   But give us still to find thee near,

   And own us still for thine.

   2 When each can feel his brother's sigh,

   And with him bear a part;

   When sorrow flows from eye to eye,

   And joy from heart to heart:


   3 When free from envy, scorn, and pride,

   Our wishes all above,

   Each can his brother's failing hide,

   And show a brother's love:


   4 When love in one delightful stream

   Through every bosom flows,

   When union sweet and dear esteem

   3 She must employ your thoughts,

   And your unceasing care;

   Her welfare be your constant wish,

   And her increase your prayer.


   4 With humbleness of mind,

   Among her sons rejoice;

   A meek and quiet spirit is

   With God of highest price.


   5 Never offend, nor grieve

   Your brethren by the way;

   But shun the dark abodes of strife,

   Like children of the day.

   2 It can not in Eden be found,

   It grows on Immanuel's ground,

   And Jesus' life's blood it has cost.

   Our souls so united in love;

   Where Jesus is gone we shall be,

   In yonder blest mansions above.


   4 Why then so unwilling to part,

   Since there we shall soon meet again;

   Engraved on Immanuel's heart,

   At distance we can not remain.


   5 And then we shall see that bright day,

   And join with the angels above,

   Set free from our prisons of clay,

   United in Jesus' kind love.

   The sweetness of redeeming love,

   The love of Christ to me.

   This heavenly portion, Lord, be mine--

   Be mine this better part.

   With Mary at the Master's feet!

   Be this my happy choice;

   My only care, delight, and bliss,

   My joy, my heaven on earth, be this,

   Resolved this way to spend our days:

   Although we're hated by the world and Satan,

   By the flesh and such as love not God;

   Yet happy moments and joyful seasons

   We ofttimes find on Canaan's road.


   2 Since we've been waiting on lovely Jesus,

   We've felt some strength come from above,

   Our hearts have burned with holy rapture,

   We long to be absorbed in love:

   Let us sing praises for what is given,

   And trust in God for time to come;

   Sure we shall find the way to heaven;

   So farewell, brethren--we're going home.


   3 And as we go let us praise our Saviour,

   And pray for those who spurn his grace,

   Lest they should lose love's richest treasure,

   And ne'er enjoy his smiling face.

   Now here's my hand and my best wishes,

   In token of my Christian love;

   In hopes with you to praise my Jesus:

   Who look for one bright home above,

   On earth be strange and cold?

   Why, subjects of the Prince of Peace,

   In strife abide, and bitterness?

   'Twas on that night when doomed to know

   The eager rage of every foe,

   That night in which he was betrayed,

   The Saviour of the world took bread;


   2 And, after thanks and glory given

   To him that rules in earth and heaven,

   That symbol of his flesh he broke,

   And thus to all his followers spoke:


   3 My broken body thus I give

   To you, my friends; take, eat, and live;

   And oft the sacred feast renew,

   That brings my wondrous love to view.


   4 Then in his hands the cup he raised,

   And God anew he thanked and praised;

   While kindness in his bosom glowed,

   And from his lips salvation flowed.


   5 My blood I thus pour forth, he cries,

   To cleanse the soul in sin that lies;

   In this the covenant is sealed,

   And heaven's eternal grace revealed.


   6 This cup is fraught with love to men;

   Let all partake who love my name;

   They came together to break bread.
   Acts 20:7.

   Mrs. Sigourney.


   Lord, may the spirit of this feast--

   The earnest of thy love--

   Maintain a dwelling in our breast

   Until we meet above.


   2 The healing sense of pardoned sin,

   The hope that never tires,

   The strength a pilgrim's race to win,

   The joy that heaven inspires:


   3 Still may their light our duties trace

   In lines of hallowed flame,

   Like that upon the prophet's face,

   When from the mount he came.


   4 But if no more with kindred dear

   The broken bread we share,

   Nor at the banquet board appear

   To breathe the grateful prayer;


   5 Forget us not--when on the bed

   Of dire disease we waste,

   Or to the chambers of the dead,

   And bar of judgment haste.


   6 Forget not--thou who bore the woe

   Of Calvary's fatal tree--

   Those who within these courts below

   Have thus remembered thee.

   Remembering Christ.

   R. W. Noel.


   If human kindness meets return,

   And owns the grateful tie--

   If tender thoughts within us burn

   To feel a friend is nigh;


   2 O, shall not warmer accents tell

   The gratitude we owe

   To him who died our fears to quell,

   And save from endless woe?


   3 While yet his anguished soul surveyed

   Those pangs he would not flee,

   What love his latest words displayed--

   "Meet and remember me."


   4 Remember thee! thy death, thy shame,

   The griefs which thou didst bear!

   O memory, leave no other name

   But His recorded there.

   O God, unseen yet ever near!

   Reveal thy presence now,

   While we, in love that hath no fear,

   Before thy glory bow.


   2 Here may obedient spirits find

   The blessings of thy love--

   The streams that through the desert wind,

   The manna from above.


   3 Awhile beside the fount we stay,

   And eat this bread of thine,

   Then go, rejoicing, on our way,

   Renewed with strength divine.

   Come in, thou blesséd of the Lord;

   Stranger nor foe art thou:

   We welcome thee with warm accord,

   Our friend, our brother now.


   2 The hand of fellowship, the heart

   Of love, we offer thee:

   Leaving the world, thou dost but part

   From lies and vanity.


   3 The cup of blessing which we bless,

   The heavenly bread we break--

   Our Saviour's blood and righteousness,

   Freely with us partake.


   4 In weal or woe, in joy or care,

   Thy portion shall be ours;

   Christians their mutual burdens bear;

   They lend their mutual powers.


   5 Come with us, we will do thee good,

   As God to us hath done;

   Stand but in him, as those have stood,

   Whose faith the victory won.


   6 And when, by turns, we pass away

   As star by star grows dim,

   May each, translated into day,

   Be lost, and found in him.

   When burdened with my sin;

   I sought the cross of Jesus

   To give me peace within;

   I brought my soul to Jesus;

   He cleansed it in his blood;

   And in the cross of Jesus

   I found my peace with God.


   2 I love the cross of Jesus--

   It tells what I am;

   A vile and guilty creature,

   Saved only through the Lamb.

   No righteousness, no merit,

   No beauty can I plead;

   Yet in the cross I glory,

   My title there I read.


   3 I clasp the cross of Jesus

   In every trying hour,

   My sure and certain refuge,

   My never-failing tower.

   In every fear and conflict,

   I more than conqueror am;

   Living I'm safe, or dying,

   Through Christ the risen Lamb.


   4 Sweet is the cross of Jesus!

   There let my weary heart

   Still rest in peace and safety

   Till life itself depart;

   And then in strains of glory

   I'll sing thy wondrous power,

   Where sin can never enter,

   And death is known no more.

   Where friend holds fellowship with friend;

   Though sundered far, by faith they meet

   Around one common Mercy Seat.

   When tempted, desolate, dismayed;

   Had suffering souls no Mercy Seat?

   Where two or three, with sweet accord,

   Obedient to their sovereign Lord,

   Meet to recount his acts of grace,

   And offer solemn prayer and praise;


   2 "There," says the Saviour, "will I be,

   Amid the little company;

   To them unvail my smiling face,

   And shed my glories round the place."


   3 We meet at thy command, O Lord,

   Relying on thy faithful word;

   Be present in each waiting heart,

   And strength and heavenly peace impart.

   No other friend can I desire.


   My precious Lord, for thy dear name

   I bear the cross, despise the shame;

   Nor do I faint while thou art near;

   I lean on thee, how can I fear?


   2 No other name but thine is given

   To cheer my soul in earth or heaven;

   No other wealth will I require:

   No other friend can I desire.


   3 Yea, into nothing would I fall

   For thee alone, my All in All;

   To feel thy love, my only joy;

   To tell thy love, my sole employ.

   True joy of every human breast,

   Sower of life's immortal seed,

   Our Saviour and Redeemer blest!

   The tranquil hour.

   Ray Palmer.


   Thou, Saviour, from thy throne on high,

   Enrobed with light, and girt with power,

   Dost note the thought, the prayer, the sigh,

   Of hearts that love the tranquil hour.


   2 Oft thou thyself didst steal away,

   At eventide, from labor done,

   In some still peaceful shade to pray,

   Till morning watches were begun.


   3 Thou hast not, dearest Lord, forgot

   Thy wrestlings on Judea's hills;

   And still thou lovest the quiet spot

   Where praise the lowly spirit fills.


   4 Now to our souls, withdrawn awhile

   From earth's rude noise, thy face reveal,

   And, as we worship, kindly smile,

   And for thine own our spirits seal.


   5 To thee we bring each grief and care,

   To thee we fly while tempests lower;

   Thou wilt the weary burdens bear

   Of hearts that love the tranquil hour.

   Exhortation to prayer.

   Cowper.


   What various hindrances we meet

   In coming to a mercy-seat!

   Yet who, that knows the worth of prayer,

   But wishes to be often there?


   2 Prayer makes the darkened clouds withdraw;

   Prayer climbs the ladder Jacob saw,

   Gives exercise to faith and love,

   Brings every blessing from above.


   3 Restraining prayer, we cease to fight;

   Prayer makes the Christian's armor bright;

   And Satan trembles, when he sees

   The weakest saint upon his knees.


   4 Have you no words? Ah, think again;

   Words flow apace when we complain,

   And fill a fellow-creature's ear

   With the sad tale of all our care.


   5 Were half the breath thus vainly spent,

   To heaven in supplication sent,

   Our cheerful song would oftener be,

   "Hear what the Lord has done for me!"

   My only Saviour! when I feel

   O'erwhelmed in spirit, faint, oppressed,

   'Tis sweet to tell thee, while I kneel

   Low at thy feet, thou art my rest.


   2 I'm weary of the strife within;

   Strong powers against my soul contest;

   O, let me turn from self and sin,

   To thy dear cross, for there is rest!


   3 O! sweet will be the welcome day,

   When from her toils and woes released,

   My parting soul in death shall say,

   "Now, Lord! I come to thee for rest."

   Father, whate'er of earthly bliss

   Thy sovereign will denies,

   Accepted at thy throne of grace,

   Let this petition rise:


   2 Give me a calm, a thankful heart,

   From every murmur free;

   The blessings of thy grace impart,

   And make me live to thee.


   3 Let the sweet hope that thou art mine,

   My life, and death attend;

   Thy presence through my journey shine,

   And crown my journey's end.

   O Jesus, Saviour of the lost,

   My Rock and Hiding-place,

   By storms of sin and sorrow tost,

   I seek thy sheltering grace.


   2 Guilty, forgive me, Lord! I cry;

   Pursued by foes, I come;

   A sinner, save me, or I die;

   An outcast, take me home.


   3 Once safe in thine almighty arms,

   Let storms come on amain;

   There danger never, never harms;

   There death itself is gain.


   4 And when I stand before thy throne

   And all thy glory see,

   Still be my righteousness alone

   To hide myself in thee.

   How sweet to be allowed to pray

   To God, the Holy One;

   With filial love and trust to say,

   "O God, thy will be done."


   2 We in these sacred words can find

   A cure for every ill;

   They calm and soothe the troubled mind,

   And bid all care be still.


   3 O let that Will which gave me breath,

   And an immortal soul,

   In joy or grief, in life or death,

   My every wish control.


   4 O, could my heart thus ever pray,

   Thus imitate thy Son!

   Teach me, O God, with truth to say,

   Thy will, not mine, be done.

   While thee I seek, protecting Power,

   Be my vain wishes stilled;

   And may this consecrated hour

   2 Thy love the power of thought bestowed;

   To thee my thoughts would soar;

   Thy mercy o'er my life has flowed;

   Each blessing to my soul more dear,

   My heart shall find delight in praise,

   Or seek relief in prayer.


   5 When gladness wings my favored hour,

   Thy love my thoughts shall fill;

   Resigned, when storms of sorrow lower,

   I love to steal awhile away

   From every cumbering care,

   And spend the hours of setting day

   In humble, grateful prayer.


   2 I love in solitude to shed

   The penitential tear;

   And all his promises to plead,

   Where none but God can hear.


   3 I love to think on mercies past,

   And future good implore,

   And all my cares and sorrows cast

   On him whom I adore.


   4 I love, by faith, to take a view

   Of brighter scenes in heaven;

   The prospect doth my strength renew,

   While here by tempests driven.


   5 Thus, when life's toilsome day is o'er,

   May its departing ray

   Be calm as this impressive hour,

   And lead to endless day.

   2 I have no argument beside,

   I urge no other plea,

   And 'tis enough--the Saviour died,

   The Saviour died for me.


   3 When storms of fierce temptation beat,

   And furious foes assail,

   My refuge is the mercy-seat,

   My hope within the vail.


   4 From strife of tongues and bitter words,

   My spirit flies to thee;

   Joy to my heart the thought affords--

   My Saviour died for me.


   5 And when thy awful voice commands

   This body to decay,

   And life, in its last lingering sands,

   Is ebbing fast away--


   6 Then, though it be in accents weak,

   And ask for strength in death to speak--

   There humbly fall before his feet,

   For none can perish there.


   2 Thy promise is my only plea,

   With this I venture nigh;

   Thou callest burdened souls to thee,

   And such, O Lord, am I.


   3 Bowed down beneath a load of sin,

   By Satan sorely pressed,

   By war without, and fear within,

   I come to thee for rest.


   4 Be thou my shield and hiding-place;

   That, sheltered near thy side,

   I may my fierce accuser face,

   And tell him, "Thou hast died."

   Prayer.

   Montgomery.


   Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,

   Unuttered or expressed;

   The motion of a hidden fire

   That trembles in the breast.


   2 Prayer is the burden of a sigh,

   The falling of a tear;

   The upward glancing of an eye

   When none but God is near.


   3 Prayer is the simplest form of speech

   That infant lips can try;

   Prayer, the sublimest strains that reach

   The Majesty on high.


   4 Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice,

   Returning from his ways,

   While angels in their songs rejoice,

   And say--"Behold he prays."


   5 Prayer is the Christian's vital breath,

   The Christian's native air,

   His watchword at the gate of death;

   He enters heaven with prayer.

   O Lord, I would delight in thee,

   And on thy care depend;

   To thee in every trouble flee,

   My best, my only Friend.


   2 When all created streams are dried,

   Thy fullness is the same;

   May I with this be satisfied,

   And glory in thy name!


   3 No good in creatures can be found,

   But what is found in thee:

   I must have all things and abound

   While God is God to me.


   4 O that I had a stronger faith,

   To look within the vail--

   To credit what my Saviour saith,

   Whose word can never fail.


   5 He who has made my heaven secure,

   Will here all good provide:

   While Christ is rich, can I be poor?

   What can I want beside?


   6 O Lord, I cast my care on thee;

   I triumph and adore:

   Henceforth my great concern shall be

   To love and please thee more.

   Jesus, my strength, my hope,

   On thee I cast my care,

   With humble confidence look up,

   And know thou hearest my prayer.


   2 Give me on thee to wait

   Till I can all things do;

   On thee, almighty to create,

   Almighty to renew.


   3 I want a sober mind,

   A self-renouncing will,

   That tramples down, and casts behind,

   The baits of pleasing ill;


   4 A soul inured to pain,

   To hardships, grief, and loss;

   Bold to take up, firm to sustain

   The consecrated cross;


   5 I want a godly fear,

   A quick-discerning eye,

   That looks to thee when sin is near,

   And sees the tempter fly;


   6 A spirit still prepared,

   And armed with jealous care,

   For ever standing on its guard,

   And watching unto prayer.

   Like sunlight when the tempests lower,

   Prayer to the soul is nigh;

   This is our solace--let us pray.


   2 Come, let us pray: the burning brow,

   The heart oppressed with care,

   And all the woes that throng us now,

   Will be relieved by prayer:

   Jesus will smile our griefs away;

   O, glorious thought!--come! let us pray.


   3 Come, let us pray: the mercy-seat

   From him who loves us; let us pray.

   Soon shall your trembling tongues be dumb,

   Your lips forget to move.

   Come, bow; your voices raise;

   Let not your hearts his praise disown

   Who gives the power to praise.

   In mercy looks on all--

   Who seest the tear of misery,

   2 Blest is the tranquil hour of morn,

   Then are my sins by thee forgiven;

   Then dost thou cheer my solitude

   Though faint, yet pursuing, we go on our way;

   Though suffering, and sorrow, and trial, be near,

   The Lord is our refuge, and whom can we fear?

   The weak and oppressed, he will hear their complaint;

   The way may be weary, and thorny the road,

   But how can we falter? our help is in God.


   3 And to his green pastures our footsteps he leads;

   His flock in the desert, how kindly he feeds!

   The lambs in his bosom he tenderly bears,

   And brings back the wanderers all safe from the snares.


   4 Though clouds may surround us, our God is our light;

   S. Johnson.


   Father, in thy mysterious presence kneeling,

   Fain would our souls feel all thy kindling love,

   For we are weak, and need some deep revealing

   Of trust, and strength, and calmness, from above.


   2 Lord, we have wandered forth thro' doubt and sorrow,

   And thou hast made each step an onward one;

   And we will ever trust each unknown morrow--

   Thou wilt sustain us till its work is done.


   3 In the heart's depths, a peace serene and holy

   Abides, and when pain seems to have her will,

   Or we despair--O may that peace rise slowly,

   Stronger than agony, and we be still.


   4 Now, Father, now, in thy dear presence kneeling,

   Our spirits yearn to feel thy kindling love:

   Now make us strong, we need thy deep revealing

   Of trust, and strength, and calmness, from above.

   How honored, how dear, is that sacred abode,

   Where Christians draw near to their Father and God:

   'Mid worldly commotion my wearied soul faints

   For the house of devotion, the home of thy saints.


   2 Thou hearer of prayer, O still grant me a place

   Where Christians repair to the courts of thy grace,

   More blest beyond measure one day so employed,

   Than years of vain pleasure by worldlings enjoyed.


   3 Me more would it please keeping post at thy gate,

   Than lying at ease in the chambers of state;

   The meanest condition outshines with thy smiles,

   The pomp of ambition, the world with its wiles.


   4 The Lord is a Sun, and the Lord is a Shield:

   What grace has begun, will with glory be sealed;

   He hears the distresséd, he succors the just,

   And they shall be blesséd who make him their trust.

   Come, ye disconsolate, where'er you languish,

   Come, at the shrine of God fervently kneel;

   Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish;

   Earth has no sorrow that heaven can not heal.


   2 Joy of the desolate, light of the straying,

   Hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure!

   Here speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying,

   Earth has no sorrow that heaven can not cure.

   Forth from the throne of God, pure from above:

   Come to the feast of love; come, ever-knowing,

   Our humble prayer ascends; O Father! hear it,

   Upsoaring on the wings of awe and meekness;

   Forgive its weakness!

   We hear thy voice: it counsels and it courts us:

   And then we turn away; and still thy kindness

   Forgives our blindness.


   3 O, how long-suffering, Lord! but thou delightest

   To win with love the wandering; thou invitest,

   By smiles of mercy, not by frowns or terrors,

   Man from his errors.

   Shouldst lead me on!

   I loved to choose and see my path; but now,

   Matt 28:1.


   My opening eyes with rapture see

   The dawn of thy returning day;

   My thoughts, O God, ascend to thee,

   While thus my early vows I pay.


   2 I yield my heart to thee alone,

   Nor would receive another guest:

   Eternal King, erect thy throne,

   And reign sole monarch in my breast.


   3 O, bid this trifling world retire,

   And drive each carnal thought away;

   Nor let me feel one vain desire,

   One sinful thought through all the day.


   4 Then, to thy courts when I repair,

   My soul shall rise on joyful wing,

   The wonders of thy love declare,

   And join the strains which angels sing.

   Morning of hope, and joy, and love,

   Of heavenly peace and holy rest;

   Pledge of the endless rest above.


   2 Blessed be the Father of our Lord,

   Who from the dead has brought his Son!

   Hope to the lost was then restored,

   And everlasting glory won.


   3 Scarce morning twilight had begun

   To chase the shades of night away,

   When Christ arose--unsetting Sun--

   The dawn of joy's eternal day!


   4 Mercy looked down with smiling eye

   When our Immanuel left the dead;

   Faith marked his bright ascent on high,

   And Hope with gladness raised her head.

   Who to his saints this day has given,

   For rest and serious joy designed,

   Sweet is the fading light of eve;

   And soft the sunbeams lingering there;

   For these blest hours the world I leave,

   Wafted on wings of praise and prayer.


   2 The time, how lovely and how still!

   Peace shines and smiles on all below:

   The plain, the stream, the wood, the hill,

   All fair with evening's setting glow.


   3 Season of rest! the tranquil soul

   Feels the sweet calm, and melts to love,

   And while these sacred moments roll,

   Faith sees a smiling heaven above.


   4 Nor will our days of toil be long;

   Our pilgrimage will soon be trod,

   And we shall join the ceaseless song,

   Re-ascends his native heaven.

   There the glorious triumph waits--

   "Lift your heads, you heavenly gates;

   Near himself prepares a place,

   Harbinger of human race.

   Master, hear us when we pray;

   See thy needy servants, see,

   Ever gazing up to thee:

   Grant, though parted from our sight,

   Far above yon azure hight,

   Grant our hearts may thither rise,

   Follow thee beyond the skies.


   4 Ever upward let us move,

   Wafted on the wings of love;

   Looking when the Lord shall come,

   2 He saw me ruined in the fall,

   His loving kindness, O how great.


   3 Though numerous hosts of mighty foes,

   Though earth and hell, my way oppose,

   He safely leads my soul along,

   His loving kindness, O how strong!


   4 When trouble, like a gloomy cloud,

   Has gathered thick and thundered loud,

   He near my soul has always stood,

   His loving kindness, O how good!


   5 Soon shall I pass the gloomy vale,

   Soon all my mortal powers must fail;

   O may my last expiring breath

   His loving kindness sing in death!

   Imagination's utmost stretch

   3 He left his radiant throne on high,

   Left the bright realms of bliss,

   And came to earth to bleed and die!

   Was ever love like this?


   4 Blest Lord, while we adoring pay

   Our humble thanks to thee,

   May every heart with rapture say,

   5 O may the sweet, the blissful theme

   Fill every heart and tongue,

   Almighty Father! gracious Lord!

   Kind Guardian of my days!

   Thy mercies let my heart record

   In songs of grateful praise.


   2 In life's first dawn, my tender frame

   Was thine indulgent care,

   Long ere I could pronounce thy name,

   Or breathe the infant prayer.


   3 Each rolling year new favors brought

   From thine exhaustless store;

   But, ah! in vain my laboring thought

   Would count thy mercies o'er.


   4 Still I adore thee, gracious Lord!

   For favors more divine--

   That I have known thy sacred word.

   Where all thy glories shine.


   5 Lord, when this mortal frame decays,

   And every weakness dies,

   Complete the wonders of thy grace,

   And raise me to the skies.

   Long as I live I'll praise thy name,

   My King, my God of love;

   And while my lips rejoice,

   The men that hear my sacred song,

   Shall join their cheerful voice.


   4 Fathers to sons shall teach thy name,

   And children learn thy ways;

   Ages to come thy truth proclaim,

   And nations sound thy praise.


   5 Thy glorious deeds of ancient date

   Shall through the world be known--

   Thy arm of power, thy heavenly state

   3 Creatures no more divide my choice--

   I bid them all depart;

   His name, his love, his gracious voice,

   Have fixed my roving heart.

   A worthless worm like me?

   He cries aloud in melting strains,

   I come to save you from your pains,

   And end your sore complaints.


   5 The smiling millions rise and sing

   All glory! glory to our King;

   The Grand Assize is come!

   You everlasting doors, fly wide;

   The Church is glorious as a bride,

   And Jesus takes her home.


   6 In all the heavens there's not a tear,

   Nor in the realms of bliss a fear,

   But pleasure yet unknown:

   From heaven to heaven we sound the bliss,

   O what a blest abode is this,

   For ever round the throne!


   7 The joys of heaven will never end;

   All glory to the sinner's Friend!

   Roll on, you happy scenes!

   You wingéd seraphs, help us praise

   The Author of eternal joys!

   Our Jesus ever reigns.

   Psalm 100.

   Watts.


   Before Jehovah's awful throne,

   Ye nations, bow with sacred joy;

   Know that the Lord is God alone,

   He can create and he destroy.


   2 His sovereign power, without our aid,

   Made us of clay, and formed us men;

   And when like wandering sheep we strayed,

   He brought us to his fold again.


   3 We are his people--we his care--

   Our souls, and all our mortal frame:

   What lasting honors shall we rear,

   Almighty Maker, to thy name?


   4 We'll crowd thy gates with thankful songs,

   High as the heavens our voices raise;

   And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,

   Shall fill thy courts with sounding praise.


   5 Wide as the world is thy command!

   Vast as eternity thy love!

   Firm as a rock thy truth shall stand,

   To hold communion with his God,

   To send to heaven his warm desires,

   2 Blest hour, when earthly cares resign

   Their empire o'er his anxious breast,

   While, all around, the calm divine,

   Proclaims the holy day of rest.


   3 Blest hour, when God himself draws nigh,

   Well pleased his people's voice to hear,

   To hush the penitential sigh,

   And wipe away the mourner's tear.


   4 Blest hour! for, where the Lord resorts,

   Foretastes of future bliss are given,

   And mortals find his earthly courts

   The house of God, the gate of heaven.

   To the gracious eye and heart

   Of our ever-present Friend.

   Tender Shepherd of thy sheep,

   Let thy mercy and thy care

   All our souls in safety keep.


   3 In thy strength may we be strong;

   Sweeten every cross and pain;

   Give us, if thou wilt, ere long

   Here to meet in peace again.

   Peace, that floweth, as a river,

   From the eternal Source alone.


   3 O thou God of Peace! be near us,

   Fix within our hearts thy home;

   With thy bright appearing cheer us,

   Truth which we so long have sought;

   Come with thy deep consolations,

   O peace of God, sweet peace of God!

   Where broods on earth this gentle dove!

   To shelter him whom God doth love?


   2 Whence comes this blessing of the soul,

   This silent joy which can not fade?

   This glory, tranquil, holy, bright,

   Pervading sorrow's deepest shade?


   3 The peace of God, the peace of God!

   It shines as clear 'mid cloud and storm

   As in the calmest summer day,

   'Mid chill as in the sunlight warm.


   4 O peace of God! earth hath no power

   To shed thine unction o'er the heart;

   Its smile can never bring it here--

   Its frown ne'er bid its light depart.


   5 Calm peace of God, in holy trust,

   In love and faith, thy presence dwells--

   In patient suffering and toil

   Where mercy's gentle tear-drop swells.

   Into thine arms, O Lord! I flee;

   I hide me in thy faithful breast,

   And pour out all my soul to thee,

   Now, hushing every adverse sound,

   Songs of defense my soul surround,

   As if all saints encamped about

   One trusting heart, pursued by doubt.


   2 And O, how solemn, yet how sweet,

   Their one assured, persuasive strain!

   "The Lord of hosts is thy retreat,

   Still in his hands thy times remain."

   O tender word! O truth divine!

   Lord, I am altogether thine;

   I have bowed down, I need not flee;

   Peace, peace is found in trusting thee.


   3 And now I count supremely kind

   The rule that once I thought severe;

   And precious, to my altered mind,

   At length thy kind reproofs appear.

   I must be taught what I would know,

   I must be led where I should go:

   And all the rest ordained for me,

   Is to be found in trusting thee.

   4 His goodness ever nigh,

   Shall while I live, shall when I die

   Still follow me.

   And, while eternal ages roll,

   Vainly through night's weary hours,

   Keep we watch lest foes alarm;

   Vain our bulwarks, and our towers,

   But for God's protecting arm.


   2 Vain were all our toil and labor,

   Did not God that labor bless;

   Vain, without his grace and favor,

   Every talent we possess.

   That on human strength relies;

   Yet sings aloud, and doth not heed;

   By flowing stream or grassy mead,

   He sings to shame

   For he who died to set us free

   Hath called us by his word.

   While to our Lord we look;

   O'er every fierce temptation bound--

   The billows yield a solid ground,

   The wave is firm as rock.


   3 But if from him we turn our eye,

   And see the raging floods run high,

   And feel our fears within;

   Our foes so strong, our flesh so frail,

   Reason and unbelief prevail,

   And sink us into sin.


   4 Lord, we our feeble faith confess;

   O, burst these bonds, and set it free.


   2 Wash out its stains, refine its dross;

   Nail my affections to the cross;

   Hallow each thought; let all within

   Be clean, as thou, my Lord, art clean.


   3 If in this darksome wild I stray,

   Be thou my light, be thou my way;

   No foes, no violence I fear,

   No fraud, while thou, my God, art near.


   4 When rising floods my soul o'erflow,

   When sinks my heart in waves of woe--

   Jesus, thy timely aid impart,

   And raise my head and cheer my heart.


   5 Saviour, where'er thy steps I see,

   Dauntless, untired, I follow thee;

   O, let thy hand support me still,

   And lead me to thy holy hill.

   O for a heart to praise my God,

   A heart from sin set free,

   A heart that always feels the blood

   So freely shed for me.


   2 A heart resigned, submissive, meek,

   My great Redeemer's throne,

   Where only Christ is heard to speak

   Where Jesus reigns alone.


   3 O for a lowly, contrite heart,

   Confiding, true, and clean,

   Which neither life nor death can part

   From him that dwells within.


   4 A heart in ev'ry thought renewed,

   And full of love divine,

   Perfect and right, and pure and good,

   A copy, Lord, of thine.


   5 Thy Spirit, gracious Lord, impart;

   Direct me from above;

   May thy dear name be near my heart,

   That dear, best name is Love.

   Longing for Heaven.


   Sweet land of rest, for thee I sigh,

   When will the moment come,

   When I shall lay my armor by,

   And dwell in peace at home?


   Chorus.--O, this is not my home,

   O, this is not my home:

   This world's a wilderness of woe,

   This world is not my home.


   2 No tranquil joy on earth I know,

   No peaceful, sheltering dome;

   This world's a wilderness of woe,

   This world is not my home.


   3 When by affliction sharply tried,

   I view the gaping tomb,

   Although I dread death's chilling tide,

   Yet still I sigh for home.


   4 Weary of wandering round and round

   I long to quit the unhallowed ground,

   With joy I would renounce them all,

   For leave to call thee mine.


   5 Should earth's vain treasures all depart

   Of this dear gift possessed,

   I'd clasp it to my joyful heart,

   And be for ever blest.

   Give me the wings of faith, to rise

   And bathed their couch with tears;

   They wrestled hard, as we do now,

   With sins, and doubts, and fears.


   3 I ask them whence their victory came;

   They, with united breath,

   Ascribe their conquest to the Lamb,

   Their triumph to his death.


   4 They marked the footsteps that he trod;

   His zeal inspired their breast;

   And, following their incarnate God,

   Possessed the promised rest.

   The dove, let loose in eastern skies,

   Returning fondly home,

   Ne'er stoops to earth her wing, nor flies

   Where idle warblers roam;--


   2 But high she shoots through air and light

   Above all low delay,

   Where nothing earthly bounds her flight,

   Nor shadow dims her way.


   3 So grant me, Lord, from every snare

   And stain of passion free,

   Aloft, through faith's serener air,

   To urge my course to thee;--


   4 No sin to cloud, no lure to stay,

   My soul as home she springs;

   Thy freedom on her wings.

   Shall tempt my feet to roam,

   To seek a dwelling-place below,

   Since heavén is my home.


   3 O, were this earth as fair as when

   Primeval Eden smiled,

   I would not by its glowing charms

   To a brighter, holier sphere.

   Earth, 'tis true hath friends that bless me

   With their fond and faithful love;

   But the hands of angels beckon

   Onward to the climes above.


   2 Let me go; for earth hath sorrow,

   Sin, and pain, and bitter tears;

   All its paths are dark and dreary,

   All its hopes are fraught with fears;

   Short-lived are its brightest flowers,

   Soon its cherished joys decay:--

   Let me go; I fain would leave it

   For the realms of endless day.


   3 Let me go; my heart hath tasted

   Of my Saviour's wondrous grace;

   Let me go, where I shall ever

   For, then, would I soon be at rest;

   I'd fly to the mansions above;

   The home of the pure and the blest;

   The place where no sorrow or tears

   Can ever my pleasures destroy;

   But where through eternity's years,

   I'll drink from an ocean of Joy!


   2 The clouds that now hang o'er my soul,

   Make dark all the pathway of life;

   While thunders unceasingly roll

   In storms of deep anger and strife;

   I hope for some bright ray to beam

   From clouds where there yet may be light,

   But only the lightning's red gleam

   Is seen through the darkness of night.


   3 I try to be humble and meek,

   Leave all to my Saviour's own will;

   For, He to the tempest can speak,

   The winds will obey and be still;

   But now my soul flutters and cries,

   And longs to be soaring away,

   From darkness and gloom, to the skies,

   The regions of bright, endless day.


   4 Dear Saviour, O, let me come home,

   And rest on thy bosom in peace;

   No more from thy presence to roam--

   Then tempests and storms shall all cease.

   I'll sing of thy wonderful ways,

   With all of the glorified throng--

   For ever and ever, thy praise,

   Shall be the one theme of my song.

   And dwell with him above,

   To drink the flowing fountain

   Of everlasting love?

   When shall I be delivered

   From this vain world of sin,

   And with my blesséd Jesus

   Drink endless pleasures in?


   2 But now I am a soldier,

   My Captain's gone before:

   He's given me my orders,

   And tells me not to fear.

   And if I hold out faithful,

   A crown of life he'll give,

   And all his valiant soldiers

   Eternal life shall have.


   3 Through grace I am determined

   To conquer though I die;

   And then away to Jesus

   On wings of love I'll fly.

   Farewell to sin and sorrow,

   I bid them both adieu:

   And you, my friends, prove faithful,

   And on your way pursue.


   4 And if you meet with troubles

   And trials on the way,

   Then cast your care on Jesus,

   And don't forget to pray.

   Gird on the heavenly armor

   Of faith, and hope, and love,

   And when your warfare's ended,

   You'll reign with him above.


   5 O! do not be discouraged,

   For Jesus is your Friend,

   And if you long for knowledge,

   On him you may depend;

   Neither will he upbraid you,

   Though often you request;

   He'll give you grace to conquer,

   And take you home to rest.

   And yet how few are grieving

   Trial bear and pain,

   4 Suffering still and doing,

   To his will resigned,

   And to God subduing

   Heart, and will, and mind:


   5 Higher yet and higher,

   Out of clouds and night,

   Nearer yet and nearer

   Rising to the light--


   6 Oft these earnest longings

   Swell within my breast,

   Yet their inner meaning

   Ne'er can be expressed.

   I would not live alway.
   Job. 7:16.

   Muhlenberg.


   I would not live alway: I ask not to stay

   Where storm after storm rises dark o'er the way;

   The few cloudy mornings that dawn on us here

   Are enough for life's woes, full enough for its cheer.


   2 I would not live alway: no, welcome the tomb;

   Since Jesus has lain there, I dread not its gloom;

   There sweet be my rest, till he bid me arise

   To hail him in triumph descending the skies.


   3 Who, who would live alway, away from his God,

   Away from yon heaven, that blissful abode,

   Where the rivers of pleasure flow o'er the bright plains,

   And the noontide of glory eternally reigns;


   4 Where the saints of all ages in harmony meet,

   Their Saviour and brethren transported to greet,

   While the anthems of rapture unceasingly roll,

   And the smile of the Lord is the feast of the soul!

   I am weary.


   I am weary of straying; O fain would I rest,

   In that far distant land of the pure and the blest;

   Where sin can no longer her blandishment spread,

   And tears and temptations for ever are fled.


   2 I am weary of hoping, where hope is untrue,

   As fair but as fleeting, as morning's bright dew;

   I long for the land whose blest promise alone

   Is as changeless and sure as eternity's throne.


   3 I am weary of sighing o'er sorrows of earth,

   O'er joy's glowing visions, that fade at their birth,

   O'er pangs of the loved, which we can not assuage,

   O'er the blightings of youth, and the weakness of age.


   4 I am weary of loving what passes away--

   The sweetest and dearest, alas, may not stay!

   I long for that land where those partings are o'er,

   And death and the tomb can divide hearts no more.


   5 I am weary, my Saviour, of grieving thy love;

   O! when shall I rest in thy presence above;

   I am weary--but O! let me never repine,

   While thy word, and thy love, and thy promise are mine.

   Strangers and pilgrims.
   1 Pet. 2:11.

   F. Lyte.


   My rest is in heaven--my home is not here;

   Then why sould I murmur when trials appear?

   Be hushed, my sad spirit, the worst that may come

   But shortens thy journey and hastens thee home.


   2 A pilgrim and stranger, I seek not my bliss,

   Nor lay up my treasures in regions like this;

   I look for a city which hands have not piled;

   I pant for a country by sin undefiled.


   3 Afflictions may try me, but can not destroy;

   One vision of home turns them all into joy;

   And the bitterest tear that flows from my eyes,

   But sweetens my hope of that home in the skies.


   4 Though foes and temptations my progress oppose,

   They only make heaven more sweet at the close;

   Come joy or come sorrow--the worst may befall,

   One moment in heaven will make up for all.


   5 The thorn and the thistle around me may grow,

   I would not repose upon roses below;

   I ask not my portion, I seek not my rest,

   Till, seated with Jesus, I lean on his breast.


   6 A scrip for the way and a staff in my hand,

   I march on in haste through the enemy's land:

   The road may be rough, but it can not be long:

   So I'll smooth it with hope, and I'll cheer it with song.

   Psalm 17:15.


   Not here! not here! not where the sparkling waters

   Fade into mocking sands as we draw near;

   Where in the wilderness each footstep falters--

   "I shall be satisfied;" but, O! not here!


   2 Not here--where all the dreams of bliss deceive us,

   Where the worn spirit never gains its goal;

   Where, haunted ever by the thought that grieves us,

   Across us floods of bitter memory roll.


   3 There is a land where every pulse is thrilling

   With rapture earth's sojourners may not know,

   Where heaven's repose the weary heart is stilling,

   And peacefully life's time-tossed currents flow.


   4 Far out of sight, while yet the flesh enfolds us,

   Lies the fair country where our hearts abide,

   And of its bliss is nought more wondrous told us

   Than these few words--"I shall be satisfied."


   5 Satisfied! satisfied! The spirit's yearning

   For sweet companionship with kindred minds--

   The silent love that here meets no returning--

   The inspiration which no language finds--


   6 Shall they be satisfied? The soul's vague longing--

   The aching void which nothing earthly fills?

   O! what desires upon my soul are thronging

   As I look upward to the heavenly hills.


   7 Thither my weak and weary steps are tending--

   Saviour and Lord! with thy frail child abide!

   Guide me toward home, where, all my wanderings ending,

   I shall see thee, and "shall be satisfied."

   O tell me no more of this world's vain store;

   The time for such trifles with me now is o'er;

   A country I've found where true joys abound,

   To dwell I'm determined on that happy ground.


   2 The souls that believe, in glory shall live,

   And me in that number will Jesus receive;

   My soul, don't delay, he calls thee away,

   Rise, follow the Saviour, and bless the glad day.


   3 No mortal doth know what he can bestow,

   What light, strength and comfort--go after him, go;

   Lo, onward I move to a city above,

   None guesses how wondrous my journey will prove.


   4 Great spoils I shall win, from death, hell, and sin,

   'Midst outward afflictions, I feel Christ within;

   And when I'm to die, receive me, I'll cry,

   For Jesus has loved me--I can not tell why.


   5 But this I do find, we two are so joined,

   He'll not live in glory, and leave me behind,

   So this is the race I'm running, through grace,

   Henceforth, till admitted to see my Lord's face.


   6 Now this is my care, that my neighbors may share

   These blessings: to seek them will none of you dare?

   When shall my soul thy glorious presence feel,

   And find, dear Saviour, it is free from stain?

   O! it will be glorious.


   Christians, keep your armor bright,

   Rejoice, give thanks, and sing;

   In union strong together fight;

   Hosanna to our King!

   Come, laud and magnify his name,

   Nor let his praises cease;

   His ways are ways of pleasantness

   And all his paths are peace.

   CHORUS.

   O it will be glorious.

   With crowns and palms victorious,

   And Jesus reigning over us,

   When our sad warfare's o'er.


   2 We will not act the coward's part,

   But onward all proceed:

   Our Captain shall his grace impart

   In every time of need.

   Great peace have they who love his cause,

   And on his word rely;

   From such as keep his holy laws,

   The enemy will fly.


   3 The world and sin may grieve us sore,

   And rouse our weakest fears;

   Our march is but a few days more

   Through this dark vale of tears.

   Death may assail, and Satan too,

   With his opposing powers;

   But let us prove our valor true,

   The victory is ours.

   From place to place am driven;

   My friends are gone, and I'm in gloom,

   But beyond this vale of sorrow

   Lie the realms of endless day.

   Dear young soldiers, do not murmur

   At the troubles of the way;

   Meet the tempest--fight with courage--

   Never faint, but often pray.


   2 He whose thunder shakes creation;

   He that bids the planets roll;

   He that rides upon the tempest,

   And whose scepter sways the whole--

   Jesus, Jesus, will defend you;

   Trust in him and him alone;

   He has shed his blood to save you,

   And will bring you to his throne.


   3 There on flowery fields of pleasure,

   And the hills of endless rest,

   Joy, and peace, and love, shall ever,

   Reign and triumph in your breast.

   There ten thousand flaming seraphs

   Fly across the heavenly plain;

   There they sing immortal praises!

   Glory, glory is their theme.


   4 But, methinks, a sweeter concert

   Makes the crystal arches ring,

   And a song is heard in Zion

   Which the angels can not sing:

   Who can paint those sons of glory,

   Ransomed souls that dwell on high,

   Who, with golden harps, for ever

   Sound redemption through the sky.


   5 See the heavenly host in rapture

   Gazing on these shining bands;

   Wondering at their costly garments,

   And the laurels in their hands;

   There upon the golden pavement,

   See the ransomed march along!

   While the splendid courts of glory

   Sweetly echo with their song!


   6 Here I see the under shepherds,

   And the flocks they fed below,

   Here with joy they dwell together,

   Jesus is their shepherd now.

   Hail! you happy, happy spirits!

   Welcome to the blissful plain--

   Glory, honor, and salvation;

   Reign, sweet Shepherd, ever reign.

   G. N. Allen.


   Must Simon bear the cross alone,

   And all the world go free?

   No, there's a cross for every one,

   And there's a cross for me.

   Yes, there's a cross on Calvary,

   Through which by faith the crown I see;

   To me 'tis pardon bringing;

   O that's the cross for me!


   2 How happy are the saints above,

   Who once went mourning here!

   But now they taste unmingled love,

   And joy without a tear.

   For perfect love will dry the tear,

   And cast out all tormenting fear,

   Which round my heart is clinging;

   O that's the love for me.


   3 We'll bear the consecrated cross,

   Till from the cross we're free;

   And then go home to wear the crown,

   For there's a crown for me.

   Yes, there's a crown in heaven above,

   The purchase of my Saviour's love,

   For me at his appearing;

   O that's the crown for me!


   4 The saints shall hear the midnight cry;

   The Lord will then appear,

   And virgins rise with burning lamps,

   To meet him in the air;

   For there's a home in heaven prepared,

   A house by saints and angels shared,

   Where Christ is interceding;

   O that's the home for me!

   O my soul! what means this sadness?

   Wherefore art thou thus cast down?

   Let thy griefs be turned to gladness;

   Bid thy restless fears begone;

   Look to Jesus,

   And rejoice in his dear name.


   2 What though Satan's strong temptations

   Vex and grieve thee day by day

   And thy sinful inclinations

   Often fill thee with dismay;

   Thou shalt conquer,

   Through the Lamb's redeeming blood.


   3 Though ten thousand ills beset thee,

   From without and from within,

   Jesus saith he'll ne'er forget thee,

   But will save from hell and sin.

   He is faithful

   To perform his gracious word.


   4 Though distresses now attend thee,

   And thou treadest the thorny road;

   His right hand shall still defend thee;

   Soon he'll bring thee home to God,

   Therefore praise him,

   Praise the great Redeemer's name.

   Like the heavenly host above,

   Who for ever bow before him,

   A kingdom with my rights in,--

   O that's the war for me.


   5 This land of sin and sorrow,

   Is not the land for me,

   Where anguish oft I borrow

   From dying company;

   Th' immortal land is far away,

   I'll enter it on some bright day,

   That day may be to-morrow--

   O that's the land for me.

   Whereas I was blind, now I see.
   John. 9:25.

   Grant.


   O Saviour whose mercy, severe in its kindness,

   Hath chastened my wanderings and guided my way,

   Adored be the power that hath pitied my blindness,

   And weaned me from phantoms that smiled to betray.


   2 Enchanted with all that was dazzling and fair,

   I followed the rainbow--I caught at the toy;

   And still in displeasure thy goodness was there,

   Disappointing the hope, and defeating the joy.


   3 The blossom blushed bright, but a worm was below;

   The moonlight shone fair, there was blight in the beam;

   Sweet whispered the breeze, but it whispered of woe;

   And bitterness flowed in the soft, flowing stream.


   4 So, cured of my folly, yet cured but in part,

   I turned to the refuge thy pity displayed;

   And still did this eager and credulous heart

   Weave visions of promise, that bloomed but to fade.


   5 I thought that the course of the pilgrim to heaven

   Would be bright as the summer, and glad as the morn;

   Thou showedst me the path, it was dark and uneven;

   All rugged with rock, and all tangled with thorn.


   6 I dreamed of celestial reward and renown,

   I grasped at the triumph that blesses the brave;

   I asked for the palm branch, the robe, and the crown,

   I asked, and thou showedst me the cross and a grave!


   7 Subdued and instructed, at length to thy will,

   My hopes, and my wishes, my all I resign;

   O give me a heart that can wait and be still,

   Nor know of a wish or a pleasure but thine.


   8 There are mansions exempted from sin and from woe,

   But they stand in a region by mortals untrod;

   There are rivers of joy--but they roll not below;

   There is rest--but it dwells in the presence of God.

   Behold we count them happy which endure?

   What treasure wouldst thou, in the land Egyptian,

   Repass the stormy waters to secure?

   2 O, oft a deeper test of faith

   Than prison-cell, or martyr's stake,

   The self-renouncing watchfulness

   Of silent prayer may make.

   Our erring brother in the wrong;

   And in the ear of pride and power

   Our warning voice is strong.

   From the German, by Whittier.


   To weary hearts, to mourning homes,

   God's meekest angel gently comes;

   No power hath he to banish pain,

   Or give us back our lost again;

   And yet, in tenderest love, our dear

   And heavenly Father sends him here.


   2 Angel of patience! sent to calm

   Our feverish brows with cooling balm,

   To lay with hope the storms of fear,

   And reconcile life's smile and tear,

   The throbs of wounded pride to still,

   And make our own our Father's will!


   3 O thou, who mournest on thy way,

   With longings for the close of day,

   He walks with thee, that angel kind,

   And gently whispers, "Be resigned!

   Bear up, bear on, the end shall tell,

   The dear Lord ordereth all things well."

   Wrapped yet in fears and mystery;

   I can not, Lord, thy purpose see;

   Yet all is well, since ruled by thee.


   2 So trusting in thy love, I tread

   The narrow path of duty on;

   What though some cherished joys are fled?

   What though some flattering dreams are gone?

   Yet purer, nobler joys remain,

   'Mid smitten joys and buried loves,

   When sleep my tearful pillow flies,

   O lead me by thine own right hand;

   Choose out the path for me.


   2 Smooth let it be, or rough,

   It will be still the best;

   Winding or straight, it matters not,

   It leads me to thy rest.


   3 I dare not choose my lot,

   I would not if I might;

   But choose thou for me, O my God!

   So shall I walk aright.


   4 The kingdom that I seek

   Is thine; so let the way

   That leads to it, O Lord! be thine,

   Else I must surely stray.


   5 My portion thou! my cup

   With joy or sorrow fill;

   As ever best to thee may seem,

   Choose thou my good and ill.


   6 Choose thou for me my friends,

   My sickness or my health;

   Choose thou my joys and cares for me,

   My poverty or wealth.


   7 Not mine, not mine the choice,

   In things or great or small;

   Be thou my Guide, my Guard, my Strength,

   My Wisdom, and my All.

   My God, my Strength, my Hope,

   On thee I cast my care,

   With humble confidence look up,

   And know thou hearest my prayer.

   Give me on thee to wait,

   Till I can all things do--

   On thee, almighty to create,

   Almighty to renew.


   2 I want a Godly fear,

   A quick-discerning eye,

   That looks to thee when sin is near,

   And bids the tempter fly;

   A spirit still prepared,

   And armed with jealous care,

   For ever standing on its guard,

   And watching unto prayer.


   3 I rest upon thy word;

   The promise is for me;

   My succor and salvation, Lord,

   Shall surely come from thee:

   But let me still abide,

   Nor from my hope remove,

   Till thou my patient spirit guide

   Into thy perfect love.

   From distrust and envy free,

   Pleased with all that pleases thee.


   2 What thou shalt to-day provide,

   Let me as a child receive:

   What to-morrow may betide,

   Calmly to thy wisdom leave;

   'Tis enough that thou wilt care--

   Why should I the burden bear?

   Into thy hand of love

   I would my all resign.

   Through sorrow, or through joy,

   Conduct me as thine own,

   And help me still to say,

   My Lord, thy will be done!


   2 My Jesus, as thou wilt!

   If needy here and poor,

   Give me thy people's bread,

   Their portion rich and sure.

   The manna of thy word

   Let my soul feed upon;

   And if all else should fail--

   My Lord, thy will be done!


   3 My Jesus, as thou wilt:

   If among thorns I go,

   Still sometimes here and there,

   Let a few roses blow.

   But thou on earth, along

   The thorny pain hast gone;

   Then lead me after thee;

   My Lord, thy will be done!


   4 My Jesus, as thou wilt!

   Though seen through many a tear,

   Let not my star of hope

   Grow dim or disappear.

   Since thou on earth hast wept

   And sorrowed oft alone,

   If I must weep with thee,

   My Lord, thy will be done!


   5 My Jesus, as thou wilt!

   If loved ones must depart,

   Suffer not sorrow's flood

   To overwhelm my heart;

   For they are blest with thee,

   Thy race and conflict won;

   Let me but follow them;

   My Lord, thy will be done!


   6 My Jesus, as thou wilt!

   When death itself draws nigh,

   To thy dear wounded side

   I would for refuge fly.

   Leaning on thee, to go

   Where thou before hast gone;

   The rest as thou shalt please,

   My Lord, thy will be done.


   7 My Jesus, as thou wilt!

   All shall be well for me;

   Each changing future scene,

   I gladly trust with thee.

   Straight to my home above

   Jesus, I my cross have taken,

   All to leave and follow thee;

   I am poor, despised, forsaken--

   Thou henceforth my all shalt be:

   Perish every fond ambition--

   All I've sought, or hoped, or known;

   Yet how rich is my condition--

   God and heaven are still my own!


   2 Let the world despise and leave me,

   It has left my Saviour too;

   Human hearts and looks deceive me,

   Thou art not like them, untrue;

   Whilst thy graces shall adorn me,

   God of wisdom, love, and might--

   Foes may hate, and friends may scorn me,

   Show thy face, and all is bright.


   3 Go then--earthly fame and treasure,

   Come, disaster, scorn, and pain;

   In thy service, pain is pleasure--

   With thy favor, loss is gain.

   I have called thee, Abba Father!

   I have set my heart on thee;

   Storms may howl, and clouds may gather,

   All will work for good to me.


   4 Man may trouble and distress me,

   'Twill but drive me to thy breast,

   Life with trials hard may press me,

   Heaven will bring me sweeter rest.

   O, 'tis not in grief to harm me

   While thy love is left to me;

   O, 'twere not in joy to charm me,

   Were that joy unmixed with thee.


   5 Soul--then know thy full salvation,

   Rise o'er sin, and fear, and care,

   Joy to find in every station,

   Something still to do or bear;

   Think what Spirit dwells within thee,

   Think what Father's smiles are thine;

   Think that Jesus died to save thee;

   Child of heaven, canst thou repine?


   6 Haste thee on from grace to glory,

   Armed by faith, and winged by prayer,

   Heaven's eternal day's before thee,

   God's own hand shall guide thee there.

   Soon shall close thy earthly mission;

   Soon shall pass thy pilgrim's days;

   Hope shall change to glad fruition,

   Faith to sight, and prayer to praise!

   Comfort not the faint and worn;

   Blot out my transgressions.
   Psalm 51.

   Watts.


   O Thou that hearest when sinners cry,

   Though all my sins before thee lie,

   Behold me not with angry look,

   But blot their memory from thy book.


   2 Create my nature pure within,

   And form my soul averse to sin;

   Let thy good Spirit ne'er depart,

   Nor hide thy presence from my heart.


   3 I can not live without thy light,

   Cast out and banished from thy sight;

   Thy holy joys, my God, restore,

   And guard me that I fall no more.


   4 Though I have grieved thy Spirit, Lord,

   His help and comfort still afford;

   And let a sinner seek thy throne,

   To plead the merits of the Son.

   The returning wanderer.

   C. Wesley


   Weary of wandering from my God,

   And now made willing to return,

   I hear, and bow beneath the rod;

   For thee, for thee alone, I mourn:

   I have an Advocate above,

   A Friend before the throne of love.


   2 O Jesus, full of truth and grace!

   More full of grace than I of sin;

   Yet once again I seek thy face,

   Open thine arms and take me in;

   And freely my backslidings heal,

   And love the faithless sinner still.


   3 Thou knowest the way to bring me back,

   My fallen spirit to restore;

   O, for thy truth and mercy's sake,

   Forgive, and bid me sin no more!

   The ruins of my soul repair,

   And make my heart a house of prayer.

   Before thy throne with tearful eyes,

   My gracious Lord, I humbly fall;

   To thee my weary spirit flies,

   For thy forgiving love I call.


   2 How free thy mercy overflows,

   When sinners on thy grace rely!

   Thy tender love no limit knows;

   O, save me--justly doomed to die!


   3 Yes! thou wilt save; my soul is free!

   The gloom of sin is fled away;

   My tongue breaks forth in praise to thee,

   And all my powers thy word obey.


   4 Hence while I wrestle with my foes--

   The world, the flesh, the hosts of hell--

   Sustain thou me till conflicts close,

   Then endless songs my thanks shall tell.

   Contrition's humble sigh;

   Whose hand indulgent wipes the tears

   From sorrow's weeping eye;


   2 See Lord, before thy throne of grace,

   A wretched wanderer mourn:

   Hast thou not bid me seek thy face?

   Hast thou not said--"Return?"


   3 And shall my guilty fears prevail

   To drive me from thy feet?

   O, let not this dear refuge fail,

   This only safe retreat!

   Sweet was the time when first I felt

   The Saviour's pardoning blood

   Applied to cleanse my soul from guilt,

   And bring me home to God.


   2 Soon as the morn the light revealed,

   His praises tuned my tongue;

   And, when the evening shade prevailed,

   His love was all my song.


   3 In prayer, my soul drew near the Lord,

   And saw his glory shine;

   And when I read his holy word,

   I called each promise mine.


   4 But now, when evening shade prevails,

   My soul in darkness mourns;

   And when the morn the light reveals,

   No light to me returns.


   5 Rise, Saviour! help me to prevail,

   And make my soul thy care;

   This poor benighted soul;

   My folly and my guilt I see,

   To thee I fly, thy pardoning love to taste.


   2 For since I left thy sweet, secure retreat,

   In search of pleasures fair, though false and vain,

   My peace--my joy have flown; no rest my feet

   Have found; and now I turn to thee again!


   3 I've sought for rest in friendship's hallowed shrine,

   But loved ones change, and earth's endearments end;

   No love is true and lasting, Lord, but thine;

   Henceforth, Incarnate Love, be thou my friend.


   4 I've sought to find a place to rest my feet

   In fame's alluring temple, bright and gay;

   In health, and competence, and pleasures sweet,

   But short and transient as the passing day.


   5 Yet all in vain: o'er all this dreary waste

   Of sin and sorrow, toil and care, and pain,

   No spot I've found, my weary feet to rest;

   Lest the wretched faint and perish

   Whittier.


   One whom Jesus loved has truly spoken!

   The holier worship which God deigns to bless,

   Restores the lost, and heals the spirit broken,

   And feeds the widow and the fatherless.


   2 Then, brother man, fold to thy heart thy brother!

   For where love dwells, the peace of God is there;

   To worship rightly is to love each other;

   Each smile a hymn, each kindly deed a prayer.


   3 Follow, with reverent steps, the great example

   Of him whose holy work was doing good;

   So shall the wide earth seem our Father's temple,

   Each loving life a psalm of gratitude.


   4 Thus shall all shackles fall; the stormy clangor

   Of wild war music o'er the earth shall cease;

   Love shall tread out the baleful fires of anger,

   And in its ashes plant the tree of peace.

   Breathe thoughts of pity o'er a brother's fall,

   But dwell not with stern anger on his fault:

   The grace of God alone holds thee, holds all;

   Were that withdrawn, thou too wouldst swerve and halt.


   2 Send back the wanderer to the Saviour's fold--

   That were an action worthy of a saint;

   But not in malice let the crime be told,

   Nor publish to the world the evil taint.


   3 The Saviour suffers when his children slide;

   Then is his holy name by men blasphemed!

   And he afresh is mocked and crucified,

   Even by those his bitter death redeemed.

   Feel as one member in another's pain;

   Win back the soul that his fair path forsook,

   And mighty and eternal is thy gain.

   An open gateway into heaven;

   Here may we sit at Jesus' feet,

   And feel our deepest sins forgiven.

   Here may desponding care look up;

   And sorrow lay its burden down,

   Or learn of him to drink the cup,

   To bear the cross and win the crown.


   3 Here may the sick and wandering soul,

   To truth still blind, to sin a slave,

   Find better than Bethesda's pool,

   Or than Siloam's healing wave;

   And may we learn, while here, apart

   From the world's passion and its strife,

   That thy true shrine's a loving heart,

   Christ took this very path before!

   Our wants and weaknesses he knows,

   From life's first dawning to its close.


   2 Do sickness, feebleness, or pain,

   Or sorrow, in our path appear?

   The recollection will remain,

   More deeply did he suffer here!

   His life, how truly sad and brief,

   Filled up with suffering and with grief!


   3 If Satan tempt our hearts to stray,

   And whisper evil things within,

   So did he, in the desert way,

   Assail our Lord with thoughts of sin;

   When worn, and in a feeble hour,

   The tempter came with all his power.

   On thy dear, faithful breast;

   Pleased to obey my Father's call

   My comfort by day and my song in the night,

   My hope, my salvation, my all!


   2 Where dost thou at noontide resort with thy sheep

   To feed on the pastures of love?

   For why in the valley of death should I weep,

   Or alone in the wilderness rove?


   3 O why should I wander an alien from thee,

   And cry in the desert for bread?

   Thy foes will rejoice when my sorrows they see,

   And smile at the tears I have shed.


   4 You daughters of Zion, declare have you seen

   The star that on Israel shone?

   Say if your tents my belovéd has been,

   And where with his flock he is gone?


   5 This is my belovéd; his form is divine,

   His vestments shed odors around,

   The locks on his head are as grapes on the vine

   When autumn with plenty is crowned.


   6 The roses of Sharon, the lilies that grow

   In the vales, on the banks of the streams,

   On his cheeks in the beauty of excellence glow,

   And his eyes are as quivers of beams.


   7 His voice, as the sound of the dulcimer sweet,

   Is heard through the shadows of death;

   The cedars of Lebanon bow at his feet,

   The air is perfumed with his breath.


   8 His lips as a fountain of righteousness flow

   That water the garden of grace;

   From which their salvation the Gentiles shall know,

   And bask in the smiles of his face.


   9 Love sits on his eyelids, and scatters delight

   Through all the bright mansions on high;

   Their faces the cherubim vail in his sight,

   And tremble with fullness of joy.


   10 He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice,

   And myriads wait for his word;

   He speaks, and eternity, filled with his voice,

   Re-echoes the praise of her Lord.

   Sorrowful, yet always rejoicing.
   2 Cor. 6:10.

   W. H. Hurlbut.


   We will not weep, for God is standing by us,

   And tears will blind us to the blesséd sight;

   We will not doubt, if darkness still doth try us:

   Our souls have promise of serenest light.


   2 We will not faint, if heavy burdens bend us;

   They press no harder than our souls can bear;

   The thorniest way is lying still behind us;

   We shall be braver for the past despair.


   3 O not in doubt shall be our journey's ending:

   Sin with its fears, shall leave us at the last;

   All its best hopes in glad fulfillment blending,

   Life shall be with us more when death is past.


   4 Help us, O Father! when the world is pressing

   On our frail hearts, that faint without their Friend;

   Help us, O Father! let thy constant blessing

   Strengthen our weakness, till the joyful end.

   All my springs are in thee.
   Psalm 87:7.

   Moore.


   As down in the sunless retreats of the ocean,

   Sweet flowers are springing no mortal can see,

   So deep in my heart, the still prayer of devotion

   Unheard by the world, rises silent to thee--

   My God! silent to thee--

   Pure, warm, silent to thee.


   2 As still to the star of its worship, though clouded,

   The needle points faithfully o'er the dim sea,

   So, dark as I roam thro' this wintery world shrouded,

   The hope of my spirit turns trembling to thee--

   My God! trembling to thee--

   True, fond, trembling to thee.

   Canticles 4:16.

   J. S. B. Monsell.


   The spring-tide hour

   Brings leaf and flower,

   With songs of life and love;

   And many a lay

   Wears out the day

   In many a leafy grove.

   Bird, flower, and tree,

   Seem to agree

   Their choicest gifts to bring;

   But this poor heart

   Bears not its part,

   In it there is no spring.


   2 Dews fall apace,

   The dews of grace,

   Upon this soul of sin;

   And love divine

   Delights to shine

   Upon the waste within:

   Yet year by year,

   Fruits, flowers, appear,

   And birds their praises sing;

   But this poor heart

   Bears not its part,

   Its winter has no spring.


   3 Lord, let thy love,

   Fresh from above,

   Soft as the south-wind blow!

   Call forth its bloom,

   Wake its perfume,

   And bid its spices flow!

   And when thy voice

   Makes earth rejoice,

   And the hills laugh and sing,

   Lord! make this heart

   To bear its part,

   And join the praise of spring!

   And I shall enter endless rest;

   There I shall live to sin no more,

   And bless thy name, for ever blest.


   3 Bid me possess sweet peace within;

   Before my spirit hence depart.

   The morning flowers display their sweets,

   And gay their silken leaves unfold,

   As careless of the noon-day heats

   And fearless of the evening cold.


   2 Nipt by the wind's untimely blast,

   Parched by the sun's directer ray,

   The momentary glories waste,

   The short-lived beauties die away.


   3 So blooms the human face divine,

   When youth its pride and beauty shows;

   Fairer than spring the colors shine,

   And sweeter than the virgin rose.


   4 Or worn by slowly rolling years,

   Or broke by sickness in a day,

   The fading glory disappears,

   The short-lived beauties die away.


   5 Yet these, new-rising from the tomb,

   With luster brighter far shall shine;

   Revive with ever-during bloom,

   Safe from diseases and decline.


   6 Let sickness blast, and death devour,

   If heaven must recompense our pains;

   Perish the grass, and fade the flower,

   If firm the word of God remains.

   To be for such a slumber meet!

   With holy confidence to sing,

   That death has lost its venomed sting.


   3 Asleep in Jesus! peaceful rest,

   Whose waking is supremely blest:

   No fear, no woe, shall dim the hour

   That manifests the Saviour's power.


   4 Asleep in Jesus! O for me

   May such a blissful refuge be:

   Securely shall my ashes lie,

   And wait the summons from on high.


   5 Asleep in Jesus! time nor space

   Affects this precious hiding-place:

   On Indian plains, or Lapland snows,

   How mildly beam the closing eyes!

   How gently heaves the expiring breast!


   2 So fades a summer cloud away;

   So sinks the gale when storms are o'er;

   So gently shuts the eye of day;

   So dies a wave along the shore.


   3 A holy quiet reigns around,

   A calm which life nor death destroys;

   And nought disturbs that peace profound

   Which his unfettered soul enjoys.

   But withers in the rising day--

   Thus lovely seemed the infant's dawn;

   Thus swiftly fled his life away!


   2 Ere sin could blight or sorrow fade,

   Death timely came with friendly care;

   The opening bud to heaven conveyed,

   And bade it bloom for ever there.


   3 He died to sin, and all its woes,

   On love's triumphant wing he rose,

   To rest for ever with his God!

   Whose course is short, unclouded, bright.


   2 O, cheerless were our lengthened way:

   But heaven's own light dispels the gloom,

   Streams downward from eternal day,

   And casts a glory round the tomb.

   What timorous worms we mortals are!

   2 The pains, the groans, and dying strife,

   Fright our approaching souls away;

   Still we shrink back again to life,

   Fond of our prison and our clay.


   3 O if my Lord would come and meet,

   Fly fearless through death's iron gate,

   Nor feel the terrors as she passed!

   To stain thy cherub-soul and form,

   Closed is the soft ephemeral flower

   That never felt a storm!

   The sunbeam's smile, the zephyr's breath,

   All that it knew from birth to death.


   3 Oh! hadst thou still on earth remained,

   Vision of beauty! fair as brief!

   They desire a better country.
   Heb. 11:16.

   C. Wesley.


   How happy is the pilgrim's lot!

   How free from every anxious thought,

   From worldly hope and fear!

   Confined to neither court nor cell,

   His soul disdains on earth to dwell--

   He only sojourns here.


   2 This happiness in part is mine,

   Already saved from low design,

   From every creature-love;

   Blest with the scorn of finite good,

   My soul is lightened of its load,

   And seeks the things above.


   3 There is my house and portion fair;

   My treasure and my heart are there,

   And my abiding home;

   For me my elder brethren stay,

   And angels beckon me away,

   And Jesus bids me come.


   4 I come, thy servant, Lord, replies;

   I come to meet thee in the skies,

   And claim my heavenly rest!

   Soon will the pilgrim's journey end;

   Then, O my Saviour, Brother, Friend,

   Receive me to thy breast!

   Death of a child.

   Bonar.


   She was the music of our home,

   A day that knew no night,

   The fragrance of our garden bower,

   A thing all smiles and light.


   2 Above the couch we bent and prayed

   In the half-lighted room,

   As the bright hues of infant life

   Sank slowly into gloom.


   3 The form remained; but there was now

   No soul our love to share;

   Farewell, with weeping hearts, we said,

   Child of our love and care.


   4 But years are moving quickly past,

   And time will soon be o'er;

   Death shall be swallowed up of life

   On the immortal shore.

   O for an overcoming faith

   To cheer my dying hours,

   To triumph o'er the monster death,

   And all his frightful powers.


   2 Joyful, with all the strength I have,

   My quivering lips shall sing,

   Where is thy boasted victory, grave?

   And where the monster's sting?


   3 If sin be pardoned, I'm secure--

   Death has no sting beside;

   The law gives sin its damning power,

   But Christ my ransom died.


   4 Now to the God of victory

   Immortal thanks be paid,

   Who makes us conquerors while we die,

   Through Christ our living Head.

   2 Though earthly shepherds dwell in dust,

   The agéd and the young;

   The watchful eye in darkness closed,

   And dumb the instructive tongue?

   His teachings to impart:

   Lord, be our Leader and our Guide,

   Rest for the weary soul?

   'Twere vain the ocean-depths to sound,

   Or pierce to either pole.


   2 The world can never give

   The bliss for which we sigh:

   'Tis not the whole of life to live,

   Nor all of death to die.


   3 Beyond this vale of tears

   There is a life above,

   Unmeasured by the flight of years;

   And all that life is love.


   4 There is a death whose pang

   Outlasts the fleeting breath:

   O what eternal horrors hang

   Around the second death!

   With blessings on thy head.


   2 Fresh roses in thy hand,

   Buds on thy pillow laid,

   Haste from this dark and fearful land,

   Where flowers so quickly fade.


   3 Before thy heart had learned

   In waywardness to stray;

   Before thy feet had ever turned

   The dark and downward way;


   4 Ere sin had seared the breast,

   Or sorrow woke the tear;

   Rise to thy throne of changeless rest,

   In yon celestial sphere!


   5 Because thy smile was fair,

   Thy lip and eye so bright,

   Because thy loving cradle care

   Servant of God, well done!

   Rest from thy loved employ;

   The battle fought, the victory won,

   Enter thy Master's joy.


   2 The voice at midnight came;

   He started up to hear;

   A mortal arrow pierced his frame,

   He fell, but felt no fear.


   3 Tranquil amid alarms,

   It found him on the field,

   A veteran slumbering on his arms,

   Beneath his red-cross shield.


   4 At midnight came the cry,

   "To meet thy God, prepare!"

   He woke--and caught his Captain's eye;

   Then, strong in faith and prayer,


   5 His spirit, with a bound,

   Left its encumbering clay;

   His tent, at sunrise, on the ground,

   A darkened ruin lay.


   6 The pains of death are past,

   Labor and sorrow cease;

   And life's long warfare, closed at last,

   His soul is found in peace.

   Fallen--on Zion's battle-field,

   A soldier of renown,

   Armed in the panoply of God,

   In conflict cloven down!

   His helmet on his armor bright,

   His cheek unblanched with fear--

   While round his head there gleamed a light,

   His dying hour to cheer.


   2 Fallen--while cheering with his voice

   The sacramental host,

   With banners floating on the air--

   Death found him at his post;

   In life's high prime the warfare closed,

   But not ingloriously;

   He fell beyond the outer wall,

   And shouted, victory!


   [3 Fallen--a holy man of God,

   An Israelite indeed,

   A standard bearer of the cross,

   Mighty in word and deed--

   A master spirit of the age,

   A bright and burning light,

   Whose beams across the firmament

   Scattered the clouds of night.]


   4 Fallen--as sets the sun at eve,

   To rise in splendor where

   His kindred luminaries shine,

   Their heaven of bliss to share;

   Beyond the stormy battle-field

   He reigns in triumph now,

   Sweeping a harp of wondrous song,

   With glory on his brow!

   All the wintery time they're passing,

   Softly as the falling snow.

   When the violets in the spring-time

   Catch the azure of the sky,

   They are carried out to slumber

   Sweetly where the violets lie.


   2 They are going--only going--

   When with summer earth is dressed,

   In their cold hands holding roses

   Folded to each silent breast;

   When the autumn hangs red banners

   Out above the harvest sheaves,

   They are going--ever going--

   Thick and fast, like falling leaves.


   3 All along the mighty ages,

   All adown the solemn time,

   They have taken up their homeward

   March to that serener clime,

   Where the watching, waiting angels

   Lead them from the shadow dim,

   To the brightness of his presence

   Who has called them unto him.


   4 They are going--only going--

   Out of pain and into bliss--

   Out of sad and sinful weakness

   Into perfect holiness.

   Snowy brows--no care shall shade them;

   Bright eyes--tears shall never dim;

   Rosy lips--no time shall fade them:

   Jesus called them unto him.


   5 Little hearts for ever stainless--

   Little hands as pure as they--

   Little feet by angels guided,

   Never a forbidden way!

   They are going--ever going--

   Leaving many a lonely spot;

   But 'tis Jesus who has called them--

   Suffer and forbid them not.

   Longfellow (Tr.)


   Alas! how poor and little worth

   Are all those glittering toys of earth

   That lure us here!

   Dreams of a sleep that death must break:

   Alas! before it bids us wake,

   They disappear.


   2 Where is the strength that spurned decay,

   The step that rolled so light and gay,

   The heart's blithe tone?

   The strength is gone, the step is slow,

   And joy grows weariness and woe

   When age comes on.


   3 Our birth is but a starting-place;

   Life is the running of the race,

   And death the goal:

   There all those glittering toys are brought;

   That path alone, of all unsought,

   Is found of all.


   4 O, let the soul its slumbers break,

   Arouse its senses, and awake

   To see how soon

   Life, like its glories, glides away,

   And the stern footsteps of decay

   Come stealing on.

   Friend after friend departs.

   Montgomery.


   Friend after friend departs;

   Who hath not lost a friend?

   There is no union here of hearts,

   That finds not here an end?

   Were this frail world our only rest,

   Living or dying, none were blest.


   2 Beyond the flight of time,

   Beyond this vale of death,

   There surely is some blesséd clime,

   Where life is not a breath,

   Nor life's affections transient fire,

   Whose sparks fly upward to expire,


   3 There is a world above,

   Where parting is unknown;

   A whole eternity of love,

   Formed for the good alone;

   And faith beholds the dying here

   Translated to that happier sphere.


   4 Thus star by star declines,

   Till all are passed away,

   As morning high and higher shines

   To pure and perfect day;

   Nor sink those stars in empty night;

   They hide themselves in heaven's own light.

   When the spark of life is waning,

   Weep not for me;

   When the languid eye is streaming,

   Weep not for me;

   When the feeble pulse is ceasing,

   Start not at its swift decreasing,

   'Tis the fettered soul's releasing,

   Weep not for me.


   2 When the pangs of death assail me,

   Weep not for me;

   Christ is mine, he can not fail me,

   Weep not for me;

   Yes, though sin and doubt endeavor,

   From his love my soul to sever,

   Jesus is my strength for ever;

   Weep not for me.

   He died at his post.

   W. Hunter.


   Away from his home and the friends of his youth,

   He hasted, the herald of mercy and truth,

   For the love of his Lord, and to seek for the lost:

   Soon, alas! was his fall--but he died at his post.


   2 The stranger's eye wept, that, in life's brightest bloom,

   One gifted so highly should sink to the tomb;

   For in ardor he led in the van of the host,

   And he fell like a soldier--he died at his post.


   3 He wept not himself that his warfare was done--

   The battle was fought, and the victory won;

   But he whispered of those whom his heart clung to most,

   "Tell my brethren, for me, that I died at my post."


   4 He asked not a stone to be sculptured with verse;

   He asked not that fame should his merits rehearse;

   But he asked as a boon, when he gave up the ghost,

   That his brethren might know that he died at his post.


   5 Victorious his fall--for he rose as he fell,

   With Jesus, his Master, in glory to dwell:

   He has passed o'er the stream, and has reached the bright coast,

   For he fell like a martyr--he died at his post.


   6 And can we the words of his exit forget?

   O! no; they are fresh in our memory yet:

   An example so worthy shall never be lost,

   We will fall in the work--we will die at our post.

   Thou art gone to the grave; but we will not deplore thee,

   Though sorrows and darkness encompass the tomb:

   The Saviour has passed through its portals before thee,

   And the lamp of his love is thy guide thro' the gloom.


   2 Thou art gone to the grave; we no longer behold thee,

   Nor tread the rough paths of the world by thy side;

   But the wide arms of mercy are spread to enfold thee,

   And sinners may hope, since the Saviour has died.


   3 Thou art gone to the grave; and its mansion forsaking,

   Perchance thy weak spirit in doubt lingered long;

   But the sunshine of heaven beamed bright on thy waking,

   And the sound thou didst hear was the seraphim's song.


   4 Thou art gone to the grave; but we will not deplore thee;

   Since God was thy Ransom, thy Guardian, thy Guide;

   He gave thee, he took thee, and he will restore thee;

   And death has no sting, since the Saviour has died.

   Christian, the vision before thee is glorious,

   Thou wast in the day of thy trial victorious,

   Secure now at last, thy temptations are o'er.


   2 Hard was the strife, but the strong one in battle,

   Has been thy defender, and vanquished thy foes;

   And heaven stood by thee to help thee in trouble,

   And joyed when the sound of thy triumph arose.


   3 High was the anthem those raptures revealing,

   Ten thousand celestials the chorus prolong;

   But louder the strains of the ransomed are pealing,

   And glory is swelling the conqueror's song.

   Far, far o'er hill and dale, on the winds stealing,

   Hark, hark, it seems to say, as melt those sounds away,

   So earthly joys decay, while new their feeling!


   2 Now through the charméd air, on the winds stealing,

   List to the mourner's prayer, solemnly bending:

   Hark, hark, it seems to say, turn from those joys away,

   To those which ne'er decay, for life is ending.


   3 So when our mortal ties death shall dissever,

   Lord, may we reach the skies where care comes never,

   And in eternal day, joining the angels' lay,

   To our Creator pay homage for ever.

   Hope of our hearts, O Lord, appear,

   Thou glorious star of day!

   Shine forth, and chase the dreary night,

   With all our tears, away.


   2 Strangers on earth, we wait for thee;

   O leave the Father's throne;

   Come with a shout of victory, Lord,

   And claim us as thine own.


   3 O bid the bright archangel now

   The trump of God prepare,

   To call thy saints--the quick, the dead,

   To meet thee in the air.


   4 No resting-place we seek on earth,

   No loveliness we see;

   Our eye is on the royal crown,

   Prepared for us and thee.


   5 But, dearest Lord, however bright

   That crown of joy above,

   What is it to the brighter hope

   Of union with our living Head,

   Of fellowship with thee?

   2 Saint after saint on earth

   Has lived, and loved, and died;

   And as they left us, one by one,

   We laid them side by side;

   We laid them down to sleep,

   But not in hope forlorn;

   We laid them but to ripen there,

   Till the last glorious morn.

   Come, then, Lord Jesus, come!


   3 The whole creation groans,

   And waits to hear that voice

   That shall restore her comeliness,

   And make her wastes rejoice.

   Come, Lord, and wipe away

   The curse, the sin, the stain,

   And make this blighted world of ours

   Thine own fair world again.

   Come, then, Lord Jesus, come!

   Day of judgment, day of wonders!

   Hark! the trumpet's awful sound,

   Louder than a thousand thunders,

   Shakes the vast creation round;

   How the summons

   Will the sinner's heart confound!


   2 See the Judge our nature wearing,

   Clothed in majesty divine!

   You who long for his appearing,

   Then shall say, "This Lord is mine!"

   Gracious Saviour,

   Own me in that day for thine!


   3 At his call the dead awaken,

   Rise to life from earth and sea:

   All the powers of nature, shaken

   By his looks, prepare to flee:

   Careless sinner,

   What will then become of thee?


   4 Horrors past imagination

   Will surprise your trembling heart,

   When you hear your condemnation,

   "Hence, accurséd wretch, depart!

   Hence, with Satan

   And his angels have your part."


   5 But to those who have confesséd,

   Loved and served the Lord below,

   He will say, "Come near, you blesséd,

   See the kingdom I bestow:

   You for ever

   Shall my love and glory know."


   6 Under sorrows and reproaches,

   May this thought our courage raise!

   Swiftly God's great day approaches,

   Sighs shall then be changed to praise:

   May we triumph,

   When the world is in a blaze!

   Ah, guilty sinner, ruined by transgression,

   What shall thy doom be, when, arrayed in terror,

   God shall command thee, covered with pollution,

   Up to the judgement?


   2 Stop, thoughtless sinner, stop awhile and ponder,

   Ere death arrest thee, and the Judge, in vengeance

   Hurl from his presence thy affrighted spirit,

   Swift to perdition.


   3 Oft has he called thee, but thou wouldst not hear him,

   Mercies and judgments have alike been slighted;

   Yet he is gracious, and with arms unfolded,

   Waits to embrace thee.


   4 Come, then, poor sinner, come away this moment,

   Just as you are, come, filthy and polluted,

   Come to the fountain open for the guilty;

   Jesus invites you.


   5 But, if you trifle with his gracious message,

   Cleave to the world and love its guilty pleasures,

   Mercy, grown weary, shall, in righteous judgment,

   Leave you for ever.


   6 O! guilty sinner, hear the voice of warning;

   There is a land mine eye hath seen,

   In visions of enraptured thought,

   So bright that all which spreads between

   Is with its radiant glory fraught;


   2 A land upon whose blissful shore

   There rests no shadow, falls no stain;

   There those who meet shall part no more,

   And those long parted, meet again.

   O trembling morning star!

   Our journey's almost done

   To the new Jerusalem.


   4 O holy! heavenly home!

   O, rest eternal there!

   When shall the exiles come,

   Where they cease from earthly care,

   In the new Jerusalem.


   5 Our hearts are breaking now

   Those mansions fair to see:

   O Lord! thy heavens bow,

   And raise us up with thee

   To the new Jerusalem.

   This is not my place of resting,

   Mine a city yet to come;

   Onward to it I am hasting--

   On to my eternal home.


   2 In it, all is light and glory,

   O'er it shines a nightless day:

   Every trace of sin's sad story,

   All the curse has passed away.


   3 There the Lamb, our Shepherd, leads us,

   By the streams of life along;

   On the freshest pastures feeds us,

   Turns our sighing into song.


   4 Soon we pass this desert dreary,

   Soon we bid farewell to pain;

   Never more be sad or weary,

   Never, never sin again.

   Rev. 21:25.


   There is no night in heaven:

   In that blest world above

   Work never can bring weariness,

   For work itself is love.

   There is no night in heaven:

   Yet nightly round the bed

   Of every Christian wanderer

   Faith has an angel tread.


   2 There is no grief in heaven:

   For life is one glad day,

   And tears are of those former things

   Which all have passed away,

   There is no grief in heaven:

   Yet angels from on high,

   On golden pinions earthward glide,

   The Christian's tears to dry.


   3 There is no want in heaven:

   The Lamb of God supplies

   Life's tree of twelvefold fruitage still,

   Life's spring which never dries.

   There is no want in heaven:

   Yet in a desert land

   The fainting prophet was sustained

   And fed by angel's hand.


   4 There is no sin in heaven!

   Behold that blesséd throng;

   All holy is their spotless robes,

   All holy is their song.

   There is no sin in heaven:

   Here who from sin is free?

   Yet angels aid us in our strife

   For Christ's true liberty.


   5 There is no death in heaven:

   For they who gain that shore

   Have won their immortality,

   And they can die no more.

   There is no death in heaven;

   But, when the Christian dies,

   The angels wait his parting soul,

   And waft it to the skies.

   No thought of ache or pain,

   No fretting hours of weakness,

   The beautiful of lands.

   Barry Cornwall.


   There is a land immortal,

   The beautiful of lands;

   Beside its ancient portal

   A silent sentry stands;

   He only can undo it,

   And open wide the door;

   And mortals who pass through it,

   Are mortals nevermore.


   2 Though dark and drear the passage

   That leadeth to the gate,

   Yet grace comes with the message,

   To souls that watch and wait;

   And at the time appointed

   A messenger comes down,

   And leads the Lord's anointed

   From cross to glory's crown.


   3 Their sighs are lost in singing,

   They're blesséd in their tears;

   Their journey heavenward winging,

   They leave on earth their fears:

   Death like an angel seemeth;

   "We welcome thee," they cry;

   Their face with glory beameth--

   'Tis life for them to die!

   Round me on every hand,

   Heaven is my fatherland--

   Heaven is my home.

   Heaven is my home;

   Short is my pilgrimage;

   Heaven is my home.

   And Time's wild wintry blast

   Soon will be overpast,

   I shall reach home at last;

   Heaven is my home.


   3 There at my Saviour's side,

   Heaven is my home;

   I shall be glorified;

   Heaven is my home.

   There with the good and blest,

   Where dangers thickest press,

   And Satan strays.


   3 But he is strong and wise,

   And we, his children blind,

   Must trust his thoughtful mind

   And tender care.

   So gentle is his love,

   We have no home but heaven;

   And strewed with many a care;

   Surrounded with temptation;

   By varied ills oppressed;

   Each day's experience warns us

   That this is not our rest.


   2 We have no home but heaven;

   Then, wherefore seek one here?

   Why murmur at privation,

   Or grieve when trouble's near?

   It is but for a season

   That we as strangers roam,

   And strangers must not look for

   The comforts of a home.


   3 We have no home but heaven;

   We want no home beside;

   O, God, our Friend and Father,

   Our footsteps thither guide,

   Unfold to us its glory,

   Prepare us for its joy,

   Its pure and perfect friendship,

   Its angel-like employ.


   4 We have a home in heaven:--

   How cheering is the thought!

   How bright the expectations

   Which God's own word has taught!

   And we wake to see the beauty

   When our changéd bodies glow,

   And we gain the full perfection

   Of the bliss begun below;

   When the life that flesh obscureth

   In each radiant form shall shine,

   And the joy that aye endureth,

   Flashes forth in beams divine:


   3 While we wave the palms of glory

   Through the long eternal years,

   Shall we e'er forget the story

   Of our mortal griefs and fears?

   Shall we e'er forget the sadness,

   And the clouds that hung so dim,

   When our hearts are filled with gladness,

   And our tears are dried by him?


   4 Shall the memory be banished

   Of his kindness and his care,

   When the wants and woes are vanished

   Which he loved to soothe and share?

   All the way by which he led us,

   All the grievings which he bore,

   All the patient love he taught us,

   Shall we think of them no more?


   5 Yes! we surely shall remember

   How he quickened us from death--

   How he fanned the dying ember

   With his Spirit's glowing breath.

   We shall read the tender meaning

   Of the sorrows and alarms,

   As we trod the desert, leaning

   On his everlasting arms.


   6 And his rest will be the dearer

   When we think of weary ways,

   And his light will seem the clearer

   As we muse on cloudy days.

   O 'twill be a glorious morrow

   Shall we not seek it, and weep no more?

   2 Is it where the feathery palm-trees rise,

   And the date grows ripe under sunny skies,

   Or, 'midst the green islands of glittering seas,

   Where fragrant forests perfume the breeze,

   And strange bright birds, on their starry wings,

   Bear the rich hues of all glorious things?

   Not there! not there!


   3 Is it far away in some region old,

   Where the rivers wander o'er sands of gold,

   And the burning rays of the rubies shine,

   And the diamond lights up the secret mine?

   And the pearl glows forth from the coral strand,

   Is it there, sweet mother, that better land?

   Not there! not there!


   4 Eye hath not seen it, my gentle boy,

   Ear hath not heard its sweet song of joy!

   Dreams can not picture a world so fair,

   3 There are beautiful birds in the bowers green,

   Their songs are blythe and sweet,

   Their warbling gushing ever new,

   The angel harpers greet.

   We'll be there, we'll be there in a little while,

   And we'll join with the pure and blest;

   We'll all have the palms, the robes, the crowns,

   And we'll be for ever at rest.

   Behold I make all things new.
   Rev. 21:5.


   That clime is not like this dull clime of ours;

   All, all is brightness there;

   A sweeter influence breathes around its flowers,

   And a benigner air.

   No calm below is like that calm above,

   No region here is like that realm of love;

   Earth's softest spring ne'er shed so soft a light,

   Earth's brightest summer never shone so bright.


   2 That sky is not like this sad sky of ours,

   Tinged with earth's change and care;

   No shadow dims it, and no rain-cloud lowers;

   No broken sunshine there:

   One everlasting stretch of azure pours

   Its stainless splendor o'er those sinless shores:

   For there Jehovah shines with heavenly ray,

   And Jesus reigns, dispensing endless day.


   3 The dwellers there are not like those of earth,

   No mortal stain they bear;

   And yet they seem of kindred blood and birth;

   Whence and how came they there?

   Earth was their native soil; from sin and shame,

   Through tribulation, they to glory came;

   Bond-slaves delivered from sin's crushing load,

   Brands plucked from burning by the hand of God.


   4 Yon robes of theirs are not like those below;

   No angel's half so bright:

   Whence came that beauty, whence that living glow,

   And whence that radiant white?

   Washed in the blood of the atoning Lamb,

   Fair as the light these robes of theirs became;

   And now, all tears wiped off from every eye,

   They wander where the freshest pastures lie.

   The home of the soul.

   Dutton.


   Oh where can the soul find relief from its foes?

   A shelter of safety, a home of repose?

   Can earth's highest summit, or deepest hid vale,

   Give a refuge, nor sorrow, nor sin can assail?

   No, no! there's no home!

   There's no home on earth--the soul has no home.


   2 Shall it leave the low earth, and soar to the sky,

   And seek for a home in the mansions on high!

   In the bright realms of bliss will a dwelling be given,

   And the soul find a home in the glory of heaven?

   Yes, yes! there's a home!

   There's a home in high heaven--the soul has a home.


   3 O! holy and sweet its rest shall be there!

   Free for ever from sin, and from sorrow and care;

   And the loud hallelujahs of angels shall rise,

   To welcome the soul to its home in the skies!

   Home, home! home of the soul!

   The bosom of God is the home of the soul!

   Ever-green mountains.

   J. F. Clarke.


   There's a land far away, 'mid the stars, we are told,

   Where they know not the sorrows of time,

   Where the pure waters wander through valleys of gold,

   And where life is a treasure sublime;

   'Tis the land of our God--'tis the home of the soul,

   Where the ages of splendor eternally roll:

   Where the way-weary traveler reaches his goal,

   On the ever-green mountains of life.


   2 Here our gaze can not soar to that beautiful land,

   But our visions have told of its bliss,

   And our souls by the gale from its gardens are fanned,

   When we faint in the deserts of this;

   And we sometimes have longed for its holy repose,

   When our spirits were torn with temptation and woes,

   And we've drank from the tide of the river that flows

   From the ever-green mountains of life.


   3 O the stars never tread the blue heavens by night,

   But we think where the ransomed have trod,

   And the day never smiles from his palace of light,

   But we feel the bright smiles of our God.

   We are traveling homeward thro' changes and gloom,

   To a kingdom where pleasures unchangingly bloom;

   And our guide is the glory that shines thro' the tomb

   From the ever-green mountains of life.

   Within the vail.
   Heb. 6:19.

   Dub. Uni. Mag.


   Upon the frontier of this shadowy land

   We, pilgrims of eternal sorrow, stand:

   What realm lies forward, with its happier store

   Of forests green and deep,

   Of valleys hushed in sleep,

   And lakes most peaceful? 'Tis the land of

   Evermore.


   2 Very far off its marble cities seem--

   Very far off--beyond our sensual dream--

   Its woods, unruffled by the wild wind's roar:

   Yet does the turbulent surge

   Howl on its very verge.

   One moment--and we breathe within the

   Evermore.


   3 They whom we loved and lost so long ago,

   Dwell in those cities far from mortal woe--

   Haunt those fresh woodlands, whence sweet carrollings soar.

   Eternal peace have they:

   God wipes their tears away:

   They drink that river of life which flows for

   Evermore.


   4 Thither we hasten through these regions dim,

   But, lo! the wide wings of the seraphim

   Shine in the sunset! On that joyous shore

   Our lightened hearts shall know

   The life of long ago:

   The sorrow-burdened path shall fade for

   Evermore.

   No night shall be in heaven! no gathering gloom

   Shall o'er that glorious landscape ever come;

   No tears shall fall in sadness o'er those flowers

   That breathe their fragrance through celestial bowers.


   2 No night shall be in heaven! no dreadful hour

   Of mental darkness, of the tempter's power--

   Across these skies no envious clouds shall roll,

   To dim the sunlight of the raptured soul.


   3 No night shall be in heaven. Forbid to sleep,

   These eyes no more their mournful vigils keep;

   Their fountains dried--their tears all wiped away--

   They gaze undazzled on eternal day.


   4 No night shall be in heaven--no sorrow's reign;

   No secret anguish, no corporeal pain;

   No shivering limbs, no burning fever there;

   No soul's eclipse, no winter of despair.


   5 No night shall be in heaven, but endless noon--

   No fast declining sun, no waning moon:

   But there the Lamb shall yield perpetual light,

   'Mid pastures green, and waters ever bright.

   Thou sovereign Lord of earth and skies,

   Supremely good, supremely wise;

   Fix thou the place of our abode;

   But may we still live near to God.


   2 Where'er our dwelling shall be found,

   We will thy throne of grace surround;

   An altar to thy name will raise,

   With sacrifice of prayer and praise.


   3 With faith and with devotion, Lord!

   Teach us each day to hear thy word:

   Grant us thy light to learn thy will,

   And strength our duties to fulfill.


   4 Our circles with thy presence bless;

   Keep out each root of bitterness;

   And may, to each, the last remove

   Be to the mansions of thy love.

   My mother's Bible.

   This book is all that's left me now,

   Tears will unbidden start,

   With faltering heart and throbbing brow,

   I press it to my heart.

   For many generations past,

   Here is our family tree;

   My mother's hand this Bible clasped;

   She dying gave it me.


   2 Ah! well do I remember those

   Whose name these records bear;

   Who round the hearth-stone used to close,

   After the evening prayer,

   And tell of what those pages said,

   In terms my heart would thrill!

   Though they are with the silent dead,

   Here are they living still.


   3 My father read this holy book

   To brothers, sisters dear;

   How calm was my poor mother's look,

   Who leaned God's word to hear.

   Her angel face--I see it yet!

   What thronging memories come!

   Again that little group is met,

   Within the walls of home.


   4 Thou truest friend man ever knew,

   Thy constancy I've tried;

   Where all were false, I found thee true--

   My counselor and guide.

   The mines of earth no treasures give,

   That could this volume buy;

   In teaching me the way to live,

   It taught me how to die.

   Creating and preserving grace

   Let all that is within me praise.

   New every morning is the love

   Our wakening and uprising prove;

   Through sleep and darkness safely brought,

   Restored to life, and power, and thought.


   2 New mercies, each returning day,

   Hover around us while we pray:

   New perils past, new sins forgiven,

   New thoughts of God, new hopes of heaven.


   3 Old friends, old scenes will lovelier be

   As more of heaven in each we see;

   Some softening gleam of love and prayer

   Shall dawn on every cross and care.

   The shadows of the evening hours

   Fall from the darkening sky;

   Upon the fragrance of the flowers

   The dews of evening lie:

   Before thy throne, O Lord of heaven,

   We kneel at close of day;

   Look on thy children from on high,

   And hear us while we pray.


   2 The sorrows of thy servants, Lord,

   O, do not thou despise;

   But let the incense of our prayers

   Before thy mercy rise;

   The brightness of the coming night

   Upon the darkness rolls:

   With hopes of future glory chase

   The shadows on our souls.


   3 Slowly the rays of daylight fade;

   So fade within our heart

   The hopes in earthly love and joy,

   That one by one depart;

   Slowly the bright stars, one by one,

   Within the heavens shine;

   Give us, O Lord, fresh hopes in heaven

   And trust in things divine.


   4 Let peace, O Lord, thy peace, O God,

   Upon our souls descend;

   From midnight fears and perils, thou

   Our trembling hearts defend;

   Give us a respite from our toil,

   Calm and subdue our woes;

   Through the long day we suffer, Lord,

   O, give us now repose!

   For all who are washed and forgiven;

   And many dear children are gathering there--

   When I am old--forsake me not.
   Psalm 71:18.

   Watts.


   God of my childhood and my youth,

   The Guide of all my days,

   I have declared thy heavenly truth,

   And told thy wondrous ways.


   2 Wilt thou forsake my hoary hairs,

   And leave my fainting heart?

   Who shall sustain my sinking years,

   If God, my strength, depart?


   3 Let me thy power and truth proclaim

   To the surviving age,

   And leave a savor of thy name

   When I shall quit the stage.


   4 The land of silence and of death

   Attends my next remove;

   O, may these poor remains of breath

   Teach the wide world thy love.

   Watch and pray.


   Go watch and pray; thou canst not tell

   How near thine hour may be;

   Thou canst not know how soon the bell

   May toll its notes for thee:

   Death's countless snares beset thy way;

   Frail child of dust, go watch and pray.


   2 Fond youth, while free from blighting care,

   Does thy firm pulse beat high?

   Do hope's glad visions, bright and fair,

   Dilate before thine eye?

   Soon these must change, must pass away;

   Frail child of dust, go watch and pray.


   3 Thou aged man, life's wintry storm

   Hath seared thy vernal bloom;

   With trembling limbs, and wasting form,

   Thou'rt bending o'er thy tomb;

   And can vain hope lead thee astray?

   Go, weary pilgrim, watch and pray.


   4 Ambition, stop thy panting breath:

   Pride, sink thy lifted eye!

   Behold the caverns, dark with death,

   Before you open lie:

   The heavenly warning now obey;

   Ye sons of pride, go watch and pray.

   Thou art my trust from my youth.
   Psalm 71:5.

   Sir Robt. Grant.


   Thy mercy heard my infant prayer,

   Thy love, with all a mother's care,

   Sustained my childish days;

   Thy goodness watched my ripening youth,

   And formed my heart to love thy truth,

   And filled my lips with praise.


   2 Then e'en in age and grief, thy name

   Shall still my languid heart inflame,

   And bow my faltering knee:

   O! yet this bosom feels the fire,

   This trembling hand and drooping lyre

   Have yet a strain for thee!


   3 Yes! broken, tuneless, still, O Lord,

   This voice transported shall record

   Thy goodness, tried so long;

   Till, sinking slow, with calm decay,

   Its feeble murmurs melt away

   Into a seraph's song.

   Only waiting till the shadows

   Are a little longer grown;

   Only waiting till the glimmer

   Of the day's last beam is flown;

   Till the night of earth is faded

   From the heart once full of day;

   Till the stars of heaven are breaking

   Through the twilight soft and gray.


   2 Only waiting till the reapers

   Have the last sheaf gathered home;

   For the summer time is faded,

   And the autumn winds have come.

   Quickly, reapers, gather quickly

   The last ripe hours of my heart,

   For the bloom of life is withered,

   And I hasten to depart.


   3 Only waiting till the shadows

   Are a little longer grown;

   Only waiting till the glimmer

   Of the day's last beam is flown;

   Then, from out the gathered darkness,

   Holy, deathless stars shall rise,

   By whose light my soul shall gladly

   Tread its pathway to the skies.

   2 Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;

   Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;

   Change and decay in all around I see;

   O thou who changest not! abide with me.


   3 I need thy presence every passing hour;

   What but thy grace can foil the tempter's power?

   Who like thyself my guide and stay can be?

   Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me!


   4 Hold thou thy cross before my closing eyes;

   Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies;

   Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;

   In life, in death, O Lord! abide with me.

   2 Ye who have mourned when the spring flowers were taken,

   When the ripe fruit fell richly to the ground,

   When the loved slept, in brighter homes to waken,

   Where their pale brows with spirit-wreaths are crowned.


   3 Large are the mansions in thy Father's dwelling,

   Glad are the homes that sorrows never dim;

   Sweet are the harps in holy music swelling,

   Soft are the tones which raise the heavenly hymn.


   4 There, like an Eden, blossoming in gladness,

   Bloom the fair flowers the earth too rudely pressed;

   Come unto me, all ye who droop in sadness,

   Come unto me, and I will give you rest.

   2 The flowery spring at thy command

   Embalms the air and paints the land;

   3 Thy hand in autumn richly pours

   Through all our coasts redundant stores,

   And winters, softened by thy care,

   No more a face of horror wear.

   Hugh White.


   With songs and honors sounding loud,

   Address the Lord on high;

   Over the heaven's he spreads his cloud,

   And waters vail the sky.


   2 He sends his showers of blessings down

   To cheer the plains below;

   He makes the grass the mountains crown,

   And corn in valleys grow.


   3 His steady counsels change the face

   Of the declining year;

   He bids the sun cut short his race,

   And wintery days appear.


   4 His hoary frost, his fleecy snow,

   Descend and clothe the ground;

   The liquid streams forbear to flow,

   In icy fetters bound.


   5 He sends his word, and melts the snow,

   The fields no longer mourn;

   He calls the warmer gales to blow,

   And bids the spring return.


   6 The changing wind, the flying cloud,

   Obey his mighty word;

   With songs and honors sounding loud,

   Praise ye the sovereign Lord.

   2 When in the bosom of the earth

   The sower hid the grain,

   Thy goodness marked its secret birth,

   And sent the early rain.


   3 The spring's sweet influence, Lord, was thine,

   Its mild, refreshing showers;

   Thou gavest the ripening suns to shine,

   And summer's golden hours.


   4 Thy quickening life, for ever near,

   Matured the swelling grain;

   Come, ye thankful people, come,

   Raise the song of Harvest-home!

   Ere the winter-storms begin;

   God, our Maker, doth provide

   For our wants to be supplied;

   Come to God's own temple, come,

   Raise the song of Harvest-home!


   2 We ourselves are God's own field,

   Fruit unto his praise to yield;

   Wheat and tares together sown,

   Unto joy our sorrow grown:

   First the blade, and then the ear,

   Then the full corn shall appear:

   Lord of harvest, grant that we

   Wholesome grain and pure may be!


   3 For the Lord our God shall come,

   And shall take his harvest home!

   From his field shall purge away

   All that doth offend, that day;

   Give his angels charge at last

   In the fires the tares to cast,

   But the fruitful ears to store

   In his garner evermore.


   4 Then, thou Church triumphant, come,

   Raise the song of Harvest-home!

   All are safely gathered in,

   Free from sorrow, free from sin;

   There for ever, purified,

   In God's garner to abide;

   Come, ten thousand angels, come,

   Raise the glorious Harvest-home!

   Lord of the harvest! thee we hail;

   With goodness all our years are crowned;

   Our thanks we pay

   This holy day;

   O let our hearts in tune be found!


   2 If spring doth wake the song of mirth;

   If summer warms the fruitful earth;

   When winter sweeps the naked plain,

   Or autumn yields its ripened grain;

   Still do we sing

   To thee, our King;

   Through all their changes thou dost reign.


   3 But chiefly when thy liberal hand

   Scatters new plenty o'er the land,

   When sounds of music fill the air,

   As homeward all their treasures bear;

   We too will raise

   Our hymn of praise,

   For we thy common bounties share.


   4 Lord of the harvest! all is thine!

   When spring unlocks the flowers to paint the laughing soil,

   When summer's balmy showers refresh the mower's toil;

   When winter binds in frosty chains the fallow and the flood,

   In God the earth rejoiceth still, and owns his Maker good.


   2 The birds that wake the morning, and those that love the shade;

   The winds that sweep the mountain, or lull the drowsy glade;

   The sun that from his amber bower rejoiceth on his way,

   The moon and stars their Maker's name in silent pomp display.


   3 Shall man, the lord of nature, expectant of the sky--

   Shall man, alone unthankful, his little praise deny!

   No, let the year forsake his course, the seasons cease to be,

   Thee, Father, must we always love--Creator! honor thee.


   4 The flowers of spring may wither, the hope of summer fade,

   The autumn droop in winter, the bird forsake the shade;

   The winds be lulled--the sun and moon forget their old decree;

   But we, in nature's latest hour, Lord, will cling to thee!

   Worlds his mighty voice obeyed;

   Laws which never shall be broken,

   For their guidance he hath made.


   3 Praise the Lord--for he is glorious;

   Never shall his promise fail;

   God hath made his saints victorious,

   Sin and death shall not prevail.


   4 Praise the God of our salvation;

   Hosts on high his power proclaim;

   Heaven and earth, and all creation,

   Laud and magnify his name!

   Hallelujah, Amen.

   Anniversary hymn.

   Pierpont.


   God of mercy, do thou never

   From our offering turn away,

   But command a blessing ever

   On the memory of this day.


   2 Light and peace do thou ordain it;

   O'er it be no shadow flung;

   Let no deadly darkness stain it,

   And no clouds be o'er it hung.


   3 May the song this people raises,

   And its vows to thee addressed,

   Mingle with the prayers and praises

   That thou hearest from the blest.


   4 When the lips are cold that sing thee,

   And the hearts that love thee, dust,

   Father, then our souls shall bring thee

   Holier love and firmer trust.

   Pres't Davis.


   While o'er our guilty land, O Lord,

   We view the terrors of thy sword;

   O! whither shall the helpless fly;

   To whom but thee direct their cry?


   2 The helpless sinner's cries and tears

   Are grown familiar to thy ears;

   Oft has thy mercy sent relief,

   When all was fear and hopeless grief.


   3 On thee, our guardian God, we call;

   Before thy throne of grace we fall;

   And is there no deliverance there,

   And must we perish in despair?


   4 See, we repent, we weep, we mourn,

   To our forsaken God we turn;

   O spare our guilty country, spare

   The church which thou hast planted here.


   5 We plead thy grace, indulgent God;

   We plead thy Son's atoning blood;

   We plead thy gracious promises;

   And are they unavailing pleas?


   6 These pleas, presented at thy throne,

   Have brought ten thousand blessings down

   On guilty lands in helpless woe;

   Let them prevail to save us too.

   Great Maker of unnumbered worlds,

   And whom unnumbered worlds adore,

   Whose goodness all thy creatures share,

   While nature trembles at thy power,--


   2 Thine is the hand that moves the spheres,

   That wakes the wind, and lifts the sea;

   And man who moves, the lord of earth,

   Acts but the part assigned by thee.


   3 While suppliant crowds implore thy aid,

   To thee we raise the humble cry;

   Thy altar is the contrite heart,

   Thy incense, the repentant sigh.


   4 O may our land, in this her hour,

   Confess thy hand and bless the rod,

   By penitence make thee her Friend,

   And find in thee a guardian God.

   Or else our service will but mock

   The God whom we profess to fear.


   2 Lord, while thy judgments shake the land,

   Thy people's eyes are fixed on thee!

   We own thy just, uplifted hand,

   Which thousands can not, will not see.


   3 How long hast thou bestowed thy care

   On this indulged, ungrateful spot;

   While other nations, far and near,

   Have envied and admired our lot.


   4 Here peace and liberty have dwelt,

   The glorious gospel brightly shone;

   And oft our enemies have felt

   That God has made our cause his own.


   5 But, ah! both heaven and earth have heard

   Our vile requital of his love!

   We, whom like children he has reared,

   Against his goodness rebels prove.


   6 His grace despised, his power defied,

   And legions of the blackest crimes,

   Profaneness, riot, lust and pride,

   Are signs that mark the present times.


   7 The Lord, displeased, hath raised his rod;

   Ah, where are now the faithful few,

   Who tremble for the ark of God,

   Who meet to mourn, confess and pray;

   The nation and thy churches spare,

   Be instructed ye judges of the earth.
   Psalm 2:10.

   Watts.


   Judges, who rule the world by laws,

   Will ye despise the righteous cause,

   When the oppressed before you stands?

   Dare ye condemn the righteous poor,

   And let rich sinners go secure,

   While gold and greatness bribe your hands?


   2 Have ye forgot, or never knew,

   That God will judge the judges, too?

   High in the heavens his justice reigns;

   Yet you invade the rights of God,

   And send your bold decrees abroad,

   To bind the conscience in your chains!


   3 The Almighty thunders from the sky--

   Their grandeur melts, their titles die--

   They perish like dissolving frost;

   As empty chaff, when whirlwinds rise,

   Before the sweeping tempest flies,

   So shall their hopes and names be lost.


   4 Thus shall the vengeance of the Lord

   Safety and joy to saints afford;

   And all that hear shall join and say--

   "Sure there's a God that rules on high,

   A God that hears his children cry,

   And will their sufferings well repay."

   Rise with healing on thy wing;

   To thy brightness

   Let all kings and nations come.


   2 May the heathen now adoring

   Idol-gods of wood and stone,

   Come, and, worshiping before him,

   Serve the living God alone!

   Let thy glory

   Fill the earth as floods the sea.


   3 Thou to whom all power is given,

   Speak the word: at thy command

   Let thy truth and faithful heralds

   Spread thy name from land to land:

   Lord, be with them

   Always to the end of time.

   Farewell hymn for missionaries.

   Ray Palmer.


   Eternal Lord! whose power

   Can calm the heaving ocean,

   Exalted thou,

   Yet gracious bow;

   Accept our warm devotion.


   2 For thee, our all we leave,

   Nor drop a tear of sadness;

   As on we glide,

   Be thou our guide,

   And fill our hearts with gladness.


   3 We go 'mid pagan gloom

   To spread the truth victorious;

   Thy blessing send,

   Thy word attend,

   And make its triumph glorious.


   4 And when our toils are done,

   Smooth thou the dying pillow:

   O, bring us blest

   To endless rest,

   Safe o'er death's troubled billow!

   Wake thee, O Zion! thy mourning is ended;

   God--thine own God--hath regarded thy prayer;

   Wake thee, and hail him in glory descended,

   Thy darkness to scatter--thy wastes to repair.


   2 Wake thee, O Zion! his spirit of power

   To newness of life is awaking the dead;

   Array thee in beauty, and greet the glad hour

   That brings thee salvation, through Jesus who bled.


   3 Saviour, we gladly, with voices resounding

   Loud as the thunder, our chorus would swell:

   Till from rock, wood and mountain, its echoes rebounding,

   To all the wide world of salvation shall tell.

   Missionary hymn.

   Heber.


   From Greenland's icy mountains,

   From India's coral strand--

   Where Afric's sunny fountains

   Roll down their golden sand--

   From many an ancient river,

   From many a palmy plain,

   They call us to deliver

   Their land from error's chain.


   2 What though the spicy breezes

   Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle--

   Though every prospect pleases,

   And only man is vile;

   In vain with lavish kindness

   The gifts of God are strewn;

   The heathen, in their blindness,

   Bow down to wood and stone.


   3 Shall we whose souls are lighted

   By wisdom from on high--

   Shall we, to man benighted,

   The lamp of life deny?

   Salvation! O salvation!

   The joyful sound proclaim,

   Till earth's remotest nation

   Has learned Messiah's name.


   4 Waft--waft, you winds, his story,

   And you, you waters, roll,

   Till, like a sea of glory,

   It spreads from pole to pole;

   Till, o'er our ransomed nature,

   The Lamb for sinners slain,

   Redeemer, King, Creator,

   In bliss returns to reign.

   Onward speed thy conquering flight,

   Cast abroad thy radiant light,

   Bid the shades recede;

   Tread the idols in the dust,

   Heathen fanes destroy;

   Spread the gospel's love and trust,

   Spread the gospel's joy.


   2 Onward speed thy conquering flight,

   Angel, onward haste;

   Quickly on each mountain hight

   Be thy standard placed;

   Let thy blissful tidings float

   Far o'er vale and hill,

   Till the sweetly-echoing note

   Every bosom thrill.


   3 Onward speed thy conquering flight,

   Angel, onward fly!

   Long has been the reign of night;

   Bring the morning nigh:

   Unto thee earth's sufferers lift

   Their imploring wail;

   Bear them heavén's holy gift,

   Ere their courage fail.


   4 Onward speed thy conquering flight,

   And calm and peaceful is my sleep,

   Rocked in the cradle of the deep.


   3 And such the trust that still were mine,

   Though stormy winds swept o'er the brine,

   Or though the tempest's fiery breath

   Roused me from sleep to wreck and death!

   The perfect world, by Adam trod,

   Was the first temple built to God;

   His fiat laid the corner-stone,

   And heaved its pillars one by one.


   2 He hung its starry roof on high--

   The broad, illimitable sky;

   He spread its pavement, green and bright,

   And curtained it with morning light.


   3 The mountains in their places stood,

   The sea--the sky--and "all was good;"

   And when its first few praises rang,

   The "morning stars together sang."


   4 Lord, 'tis not ours to make the sea,

   And earth, and sky, a house for thee;

   But in thy sight our offering stands--

   An humbler temple, "made with hands."

   4 Drop down behind the solemn hills,

   O Day, with golden skies!

   Serene above its fading glow,

   Night, starry-crowned, arise!

   So beautiful may heaven be,

   When life's last sunbeam dies!

   Christ the Day-Star.

   J. Wesley.


   We lift our hearts to thee,

   Thou Day-star from on high:

   The sun itself is but thy shade,

   Yet cheers both earth and sky.


   2 O, let thy rising beams

   Dispel the shades of night;

   And let the glories of thy love,

   Come like the morning light!


   3 How beauteous nature now!

   How dark and sad before!--

   With joy we view the pleasing change,

   And nature's God adore.


   4 May we this life improve,

   To mourn for errors past;

   And live this short, revolving day,

   As if it were our last.

   Evening.

   H. K. White.


   O Lord! another day is flown,

   And we, a feeble band,

   Are met once more before thy throne,

   To bless thy fostering hand.


   2 Thy heavenly grace to each impart;

   All evil far remove;

   And shed abroad in every heart

   Thine everlasting love.


   3 Our souls, obedient to thy sway,

   In Christian bonds unite;

   Let peace and love conclude the day,

   And hail the morning light.


   4 Thus, cleansed from sin, and wholly thine,

   A flock by Jesus led,

   The Sun of Righteousness shall shine

   In glory on our head.


   5 O still restore our wandering feet,

   And still direct our way,

   Till worlds shall fail, and faith shall greet

   The dawn of endless day.

   Flee as a bird.


   Flee as a bird to your mountain,

   Thou who art weary of sin;

   Go to the clear flowing fountain,

   Where you may wash and be clean!

   Fly, for the avenger is near thee;

   Call, and the Saviour will hear thee;

   He on his bosom will bear thee,

   Thou who art weary of sin,

   O thou who art weary of sin.


   2 He will protect thee for ever,

   Wipe every falling tear;

   He will forsake thee, O never,

   Sheltered so tenderly there;

   Haste, then, the hours are flying,

   Spend not the moments in sighing,

   Cease from your sorrow and crying,

   The Saviour will wipe every tear,

   The Saviour will wipe every tear.

   Evening prayer.


   I come to thee to-night,

   In my lone closet, where no eye can see,

   And dare to crave an interview with thee,

   Father of love and light.


   2 Softly the moonbeams shine

   On the still branches of the shadowy trees,

   While all sweet sounds of evening on the breeze

   Steal through the slumbering vine.


   3 Thou gavest the calm repose

   That rests on all; the air, the birds, the flower,

   The human spirit in its weary hour,

   Now at the bright day's close.


   4 Father! my soul would be

   Pure as the drops of eve's unsullied dew--

   And as the stars whose nightly course is true,

   So would I be to thee.


   5 Not for myself alone

   Would I the blessings of thy love implore;

   But for each penitent the wide earth o'er,

   Whom thou hast called thine own.


   6 And for my heart's best friends,

   Whose steadfast kindness o'er my painful years

   Has watched, to soothe affliction's griefs and tears,

   My warmest prayer ascends.


   7 And now, O Father, take

   The heart I cast with humble faith on thee,

   And cleanse its depths from each impurity,

   For my Redeemer's sake.

   Calvary.

   W. Baxter.


   Whene'er I think of thee,

   O! sacred Calvary,

   Love fills my breast.

   Flow, then, the joyous tears;

   Flee, all my guilty fears;

   Saviour! thy cross appears,

   And I find rest.


   2 When from thy bleeding side

   I see the crimson tide

   Streaming for me;

   Faith in thy flowing blood,

   O! spotless Lamb of God,

   Points me from earth's dark clod,

   Upward to thee.


   3 When death's unsparing dart

   Pierces my fainting heart,

   Sweetly I'll sing:

   Grave! thou no terror hast;

   All fearful gloom is past;

   Victor through Christ at last,

   Death has no sting!

   Invitation.

   Montgomery.


   Come to Calvary's holy mountain,

   Sinners, ruined by the fall!

   Here a pure and healing fountain,

   Flows to cleanse the guilty soul;

   In a full, perpetual tide,

   Opened when the Saviour died.


   2 Come in sorrow and contrition,

   Wounded, impotent, and blind;

   Here the guilty find remission,

   Here the lost a refuge find;

   Health this fountain will restore;

   He that drinks shall thirst no more.


   3 Come, ye dying, live for ever,

   'Tis a soul-reviving flood;

   God is faithful--he will never

   Break the covenant, sealed in blood;

   Signed, when our Redeemer died,

   Sealed, when he was crucified.

   Glory to our King.

   Kelly.


   Glory, glory to our King!

   Crowns unfading wreathe his head;

   Jesus is the name we sing--

   Jesus risen from the dead;

   Jesus, Victor of the grave;

   Jesus, mighty now to save.


   2 Now behold him high enthroned;

   Glory beaming from his face,

   By adoring angels owned

   God of holiness and grace:

   O for hearts and tongues to sing,

   Glory, glory to our King.


   3 Jesus, on thy people shine;

   Warm our hearts and tune our tongues,

   That with angels we may join--

   Share their bliss, and swell their songs:

   Glory, honor, praise, and power,

   Lord, be thine for evermore.

   Night.

   Thos. Park.


   Hear my prayer, O heavenly Father,

   Ere I lay me down to sleep:

   Bid thy angels pure and holy,

   Round my bed their vigil keep.


   2 Great my sins are, but thy mercy

   Far outweighs them every one;

   Down before thy cross I cast them,

   Trusting in thy help alone.


   3 Keep me through this night of peril,

   Underneath its boundless shade;

   Take me to thy rest, I pray thee,

   When my pilgrimage is made!


   4 None shall measure out thy patience

   By the span of human thought;

   None shall bound the tender mercies

   Which thy holy Son hath wrought.


   5 Pardon all my past transgressions;

   Give me strength for days to come;

   Guide and guard me with thy blessing,

   Till thine angels bid me home!

   There thou dost our place prepare;

   Ever for us interceding,

   Till in glory we appear.


   3 Worship, honor, power, and blessing,

   Thou art worthy to receive;

   Loudest praises, without ceasing,

   Meet it is for us to give.


   4 Help, ye bright, angelic spirits;

   Bring your sweetest, noblest lays;

   Help to sing our Saviour's merits,

   Help to chant Immanuel's praise.

   Let us sing the King Messiah,

   King of Righteousness and Peace;

   Hail him, all his happy subjects,

   Never let his praises cease!

   Ever hail him,

   Let his honors still increase!


   2 How transcendent are thy glories!

   Fairer than the sons of men,

   While thy blesséd mediation

   Brings us back to God again!

   Blessed Redeemer,

   How we triumph in thy reign!


   3 Gird thy sword on, Mighty Hero,

   Make thy word of truth thy car,

   Prosper in thy course triumphant,

   All success attend thy war!

   Gracious Victor,

   Let mankind before thee bow!


   4 Blessed are all that touch thy scepter,

   Blessed are all that own thy reign!

   Freed from sin, that worst of tyrants,

   Rescued from his galling chain!

   Saints and angels,

   All who know thee bless thy name!

   Excellency of Christ.

   Doddridge.


   O you immortal throng

   Of angels round the throne,

   Join with our feeble song

   To make the Saviour known:

   On earth you knew his wondrous grace:

   In heaven you view his beauteous face.


   2 You saw the heavenly child

   In human flesh arrayed,

   All innocent and mild,

   While in a manger laid;

   And praise to God, and peace on earth,

   Proclaimed aloud for such a birth.


   3 You in the wilderness

   Beheld the tempter spoiled,

   Well known in every dress,

   In every combat foiled:

   And joyed to crown the Victor's head,

   Before his frown when Satan fled.


   4 Around the bloody tree

   You pressed with strong desire,

   That wondrous sight to see--

   The Lord of life expire!

   And could your eyes have known a tear,

   In sad surprise had dropped it there.


   5 Around his sacred tomb

   A willing watch you keep,

   Till the blest moment come

   To rouse him from his sleep:

   Then rolled the stone, and all adored

   With joy unknown, our rising Lord.


   6 When, all arrayed in light,

   The shining Conqueror rode,

   You hailed his rapturous flight

   Up to the throne of God;

   Your golden wings you waved around,

   And struck your strings of sweetest sound.


   7 The warbling notes pursue,

   And louder anthems raise,

   While mortals sing with you

   Their own Redeemer's praise.

   And you, my heart, with equal flame,

   Perform your part with joy the same.
