                       Questions Which Ought To Be Asked

   A Sermon

   (No. 1511)

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   (This was followed by a farewell address from his son, Thomas
   Spurgeon.)

   But none saith, Where is God my Maker, who giveth songs in the night;
   who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser
   than the fowls of heaven?'Job 35:10-11.

   ELIHU PERCEIVED the great ones of the earth oppressing the needy, and
   he traced their domineering tyranny to their forgetfulness of God: None
   saith, Where is God my Maker?' Surely, had they thought of God they
   could not have acted so unjustly. Worse still, if I understand Elihu
   aright, he complained that even among the oppressed there was the same
   departure in heart from the Lord: they cried out by reason of the arm
   of the mighty, but unhappily they did not cry unto God their Maker,
   though he waits to be gracious unto all such, and executeth
   righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed. Both with great
   and small, with oppressors and oppressed, there is one common fault in
   our nature, which is described by the apostle in the Romans, There is
   none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.' Until
   divine grace comes in and changes our nature there is none that saith,
   Where is God my Maker, who giveth songs in the night?' This is a very
   grave fault, about which we shall speak for a few minutes, and may the
   Holy Ghost bless the word.

   I. And first, LET US THINK OVER THESE NEGLECTED QUESTIONS, beginning
   with Where is God my Maker?' There are four questions in the text, each
   of which reminds us of the folly of forgetting it. First, Where is God?
   Above all things in the world we ought to think of him. Pope said, The
   proper study of mankind is man'; but it is far more true that the
   proper study of mankind is God. Let man study man in the second place,
   but God first. It is a sad thing that God is all in all, that we owe
   everything to him, and are under allegiance to him, and yet we neglect
   him. Some men think of every person but God. They have a place for
   everything else, but no place in their heart for God. They are most
   exact in the discharge of other relative duties, and yet they forget
   their God. They would count themselves mean indeed if they did not pay
   every man his own, and yet they rob God. They rob him of his honor, to
   which they never give a thought they rob him of obedience, for his law
   has no hold on them; they rob him of his praise, for they are receiving
   daily at his hands, and yet they yield no gratitude to their great
   Benefactor. None saith, Where is God?' My dear hearer, do you stand
   convicted of this? Have you been walking up and down in this great
   house, and never asked to see the King whose palace it is? Have you
   been rejoicing at this great feast, and have you never asked to see
   your Host? Have you gone abroad through the various fields of nature,
   and have you never wished to know him whose breath perfumes the
   flowers, whose pencil paints the clouds, whose smile makes sunlight,
   and whose frown is storm. Oh, it is a strange, sad fact'God so near us,
   and so necessary to us, and yet not sought for!

   The next point is, None saith, Where is God my Maker?' Oh! unthinking
   man, God made you. He fashioned your curious framework, and put every
   bone into its place. He, as with needlework, embroidered each nerve,
   and vein, and sinew. He made this curious harp of twice ten thousand
   strings: wonderful it is that it has kept in tune so long: but only he
   could have maintained its harmony. He is your Maker. You are a mass of
   dust, and you would crumble back to dust at this moment if he withdrew
   his preserving power: he but speaks, and you dissolve into the earth on
   which you tread. Do you never think of your Maker? Have you no thought
   for him without whom you could not think at all? Oh, strange perversity
   and insanity that a man should find himself thus curiously made, and
   bearing within his own body that which will make him either a madman or
   a worshipper; and yet for all that he lives as if he had nothing to do
   with his Creator'None saith, Where is God my Maker?'

   There is great force in the next sentence: Who giveth songs in the
   night.' That is to say, God is our Comforter. Beloved friends, you that
   know God, I am sure you will bear witness that, though you have had
   very severe trials, you have always been sustained in them when God has
   been near you. Some of us have been sick'nigh unto death, but we have
   almost loved our suffering chamber, and scarce wished to come out of
   it, so bright has the room become with the presence of God. Some of us
   here have known what it is to bury our dearest friends, and others have
   been short of bread, and forced to look up each morning for your daily
   manna; but when your heavenly Father has been with you'speak, ye
   children of God'have you not had joy and rejoicing, and light in your
   dwellings? When the night has been very dark, yet the fiery pillar has
   set the desert on a glow. No groans have made night hideous, but you
   have sung like nightingales amid the blackest shades when God has been
   with you. I can hardly tell you what joy, what confidence, what inward
   peace the presence of God gives to a man. It will make him bear and
   dare, rest and wrestle, yield and yet conquer, die and yet live. It
   will be very sad, therefore, if we poor sufferers forget our God, our
   Comforter, our song-giver.

   Two little boys were once speaking together about Elijah riding to
   heaven in the chariot of fire. One of them said, I think he had plenty
   of courage. I should have been afraid to ride in such a carriage as
   that.' Ah!' Ah!' said the other, but I would not mind if God drove it.'
   So do Christians say. They mind not if they are called to mount a
   chariot of fire if God drives it, We speak as honest men what we do
   know and feel, and we tell all our fellow-men that as long as God is
   present with us we have no choice of what happens to us, whether we
   sorrow or whether we rejoice. We have learned to glory in tribulations
   also when God's own presence cheers our souls, Why do not they also
   seek to know the Giver of songs?

   And then there is a fourth point. None saith, Where is God my Maker,
   who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and make/h us wiser
   than the fowls of heaven?' Here we are reminded that God is our
   Instructor. God has given us intellect; it is not by accident, but by
   his gift, that we are distinguished from the beasts and the fowls. Now,
   if animals do not turn to God we do not wonder, but shall man forget?
   Strange to say, there has been no rebellion against God among the
   beasts or the birds. The beasts obey their God, and bow their necks to
   man. There are no sin-loving cattle or apostate fowls, but there are
   fallen men. Think, O man, it may have been better for thee if thou
   hadst been made a frog or a toad than to have lived a man if thou
   shouldst live and die without making peace with thy Maker. Thou
   gloriest that thou art not a beast: take heed that the beast do not
   condemn thee. Thou thinkest thyself vastly better than the sparrow
   which lights upon thy dwelling: take heed that thou do better and rise
   to nobler things. Methinks if there were a choice in birds, and souls
   dwelt in them, their minstrelsy would be as pure as now it is: they
   would scorn to sing loose and frivolous songs, as men do, but they
   would carol everlastingly sweet psalms of praise to God. Methinks if
   there were souls in any of the creatures, they would devote themselves
   to God. as surely as angels do. Why then, O man, why is it that thou
   with thy superior endowments must needs be the sole rebel, the only
   creature of earthly mould that forgets the creating and instructing
   Lord?

   Four points are then before us. Man does not ask after his God, his
   Maker, his Comforter, his Instructor: is he not filled with a fourfold
   madness? How can he excuse himself?

   II. Supposing you do not ask these questions, let me remind you that
   THERE ARE QUESTIONS WHICH GOD WILL ASK OF YOU.

   When Adam had broken God's command he did not say, Where is God my
   Maker?' but the Lord did not therefore leave him alone. No, the Lord
   came out, and a voice, silvery with grace, but yet terrible with
   justice, rang through the trees, Adam, where art thou?' There will come
   such a voice to you who have neglected God. Your Judge will enquire,
   Where art thou?' Though you hide in the top of Carmel, or dive with the
   crooked serpent into the depths of the sea, you will hear that voice,
   and you will be constrained to answer it. Your dust long scattered to
   the wind will come together, and your soul will enter into your body,
   and you will be obliged to answer, Here am I, for thou didst call me.'

   Then you will hear the second question, Why didst thou live and die
   without me?' And such questions as these will come thick upon you, What
   did I do that thou shouldst slight me? Did I not give you innumerable
   mercies? Why did you never think of me? Did I not put salvation before
   you? Did I not plead with you? Did I not entreat you to turn unto me?
   Why did you refuse me? You will have no answer to those questions: and
   then there will come another question'ah! how I wish it would come to
   you while there is time to answer it'How shall we escape if we neglect
   so great salvation?' To-night I put it to you that you may propose a
   way of escape, if your imagination is equal to the task. You will be
   baffled even in trying to invent an escape now, and how much more when
   your time of judgment really comes! If you neglect the salvation of God
   in Christ you cannot be saved. In the next world, how will you answer
   that question'How shall we escape?' You will ask the rocks to hide you,
   but they will refuse you that dread indulgence. You will beseech them
   to crush you, that you may no longer see the terrible face of the King
   upon the throne, but even that shall be denied you. Oh, be wise, and
   ere you dare the wrath of the King eternal and dash upon the bosses of
   his buckler, turn and repent, for why will ye die?

   III. Now, if any seek an answer to the grave enquiries of the text, and
   do sincerely ask, Where is God my Maker?' let us GIVE THE ANSWERS.
   Where is God? He is everywhere. He is all around you now. If you want
   him, here he is. He waits to be gracious to you. Where is God your
   Maker? He is within eye-sight of you. You cannot see him, but he sees
   you. He reads each thought and every motion of your spirit, and records
   it too. He is within ear-shot of you. Speak, and he will hear you. Ay,
   whisper'nay, you need not even form the words with the lips, but let
   the thought be in the soul, and he is so near you'for in him you live
   and move and have your being'that he will know your heart before you
   know it yourself. Where is your Comforter? He is ready with his songs
   in the night.' Where is your Instructor? He waits to make you wise unto
   salvation.

   Where, then, may I meet him?' says one. You cannot meet him'you must
   not attempt it'except through the Mediator. There is one God and one
   Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.' If you come to
   Jesus you have come to God. God was in Christ reconciling the world
   unto himself; not imputing their trespasses unto them, and hath
   committed unto us the word of reconciliation,' which word we preach.
   Believe in Jesus Christ, and your God is with you. Trust your soul with
   Jesus Christ, and you have found your Creator, and you shall never
   again have to say, Where is God my Maker?' for you shall live in him,
   and he shall live in you. You have found your Comforter and you shall
   joy in him, while he shall joy in you. You have also in Christ Jesus
   found your Instructor, who shall guide you through life, and bring you
   to perfection in yon bright world above.

   May the Holy Ghost use this little sermon as a short sword to slay your
   indifference; for Christ's sake.

   A Sermon

   (No. 1512)

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the Lord liveth, and as my
   lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be,
   whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.'2 Samuel
   15:21.

   Although the courage of David appears to have failed him when he fled
   from his son Absalom, yet certain other noble characteristics came out
   in brilliant relief, and among the rest, his large-heartedness and his
   thoughtfulness for others. A man in such a desperate condition as he
   was must have earnestly coveted many friends and have been anxious to
   retain them all, but yet he would not exact their services if they were
   too costly to themselves, and so he said to Ittai, who appears to have
   been a Philistine'a proselyte to Israel, who had lately come to join
   himself to David'Wherefore I goest thou also with its? Thou hast newly
   come to me, and should I make thee wander with me in my sorrows? Return
   to thy place and abide with the new king, for thou art a stranger and
   an exile. May every blessing be upon thee. May mercy and truth be with
   thee.' He did not send him away because he doubted him, but because he
   felt that he had no claim to the great sacrifices which Ittai might
   have to make in attending his checkered fortunes. I do not know what
   may become of me,' he seems to say, but I do not want to drag you down
   with myself. Should my cause become desperate, I have no wish to
   involve you in it, and therefore with the best of motives I wish you
   farewell.' I admire this generosity of spirit. Some men have great
   expectations: they live upon their friends, and yet complain that
   charity is cold. These people expect more from their friends than they
   ought to give. A man's best friends on earth ought to be his own strong
   arms. Loafers are parasitical plants, they have no root of their own,
   but like the mistletoe they strike root into some other tree, and suck
   the very soul out of it for their own nourishment. Sad that men should
   ever degrade themselves to such despicable meanness! While you can help
   yourselves, do so and while you have a right to expect help in times of
   dire necessity, do not be everlastingly expecting everybody else to be
   waiting upon you. Feel as David did towards Ittai'that you would by no
   means wish for services to which you have no claim. Independence of
   spirit used to be characteristic of Englishmen. I hope it will always
   continue to be so; and especially among children of God.

   On the other hand, look at Ittai, perfectly free to go, but in order to
   end the controversy once for all, and to make David know that he does
   not mean to leave him, he takes a solemn oath before Jehovah his God,
   and he doubles it by swearing by the life of David that he will never
   leave him; in life, in death, he will be with him. He has cast in his
   lot with him for better and for worse, and he means to be faithful to
   the end. Old Master Trapp says, All faithful friends went on a
   pilgrimage years ago, and none of them have ever come back.' I scarcely
   credit that, but I am afraid that friends quite so faithful as Ittai
   are as scarce as two moons in the sky at once, and you might travel
   over the edge of the world before you found them. I think, however,
   that one reason why faithful Ittai have become so scarce may be because
   large-hearted Davids are so rare. When you tell a man that you expect a
   good deal of him, he does not see it. Why should you look for so much?
   He is not your debtor. You have closed at once the valves of his
   generosity. But when you tell him honestly that you do not expect more
   than is right, and that you do not wish to be a tax upon him, when he
   sees that you consult his welfare more than your own, that is the very
   reason why he feels attached to you, and counts it a pleasure to serve
   such a generous-hearted man. You will generally find that when two
   people fall out there are faults on both sides: if generous spirits be
   few, it may be because faithful friends are rare, and if faithful
   friends are scarce it may be because generous spirits are scarce too.
   Be it ours as Christians to live to serve rather than to be served,
   remembering that we are the followers of a Master who said, The Son of
   man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.' We are not to
   expect others to serve us, but our life is to be spent in endeavoring
   to serve them.

   I am going to use Ittai's language for a further purpose. If Ittai,
   charmed with David's person and character, though a foreigner and a
   stranger, felt that he could enlist beneath his banner for life'yea,
   and declared that he would do so there and then'how much more may you
   and 1, if we know what Christ has done for us, and who He is and what
   He deserves at our hands, at this good hour plight our troth to Him and
   vow, As the Lord liveth, surely in whatsoever place my Lord and Saviour
   shall be, whether in death or life, even there also shall His servant
   be.'

   And so, I shall begin by noticing first in what form this declaration
   was made, that we may learn from it how to make the same declaration.

   I. IN WHAT FORM AND MANNER WAS THIS DECLARATION MADE?

   It was made, first, at a time when David's fortunes were at their
   lowest ebb, and consequently it was made unselfishly, without the
   slightest idea of gain from it. David was now forsaken of everybody.
   His faithful bodyguard was all that he had on earth to depend upon, and
   then it was that Ittai cast in his lot with David. Now beloved, it is
   very easy to follow religion when she goes abroad in her silver
   slippers, but the true man follows her when she is in rags, and goes
   through the mire and the slough. To take up with Christ when everybody
   cries up his name is what a hypocrite would do, but to take up with
   Christ when they are shouting, Away with him! away with him!' is
   another matter. There are times in which the simple faith of Christ is
   at a great discount. At one time imposing ceremonies are all the rage,
   and everybody loves decorated worship, and the pure simplicity of the
   gospel is overloaded and encumbered with meretricious ornaments; it is
   such a season that we must stand out for God's more simple plan, and
   reject the symbolism which verges on idolatry and hides the simplicity
   of the gospel.

   At another time the gospel is assailed by learned criticisms and by
   insinuations against the authenticity and inspiration of the books of
   Scripture, while fundamental doctrines are undermined one by one, and
   he who keeps to the old faith is said to be behind the age, and so on.
   But happy is that man who takes up with Christ, and with the gospel,
   and with the truth when it is in its worst estate, crying, If this be
   foolery, I am a fool, for where Christ is there will I be; I love Him
   better at His worst than others at their best, and even if He be dead
   and buried in a sepulchre I will go with Mary and with Magdalene and
   sit over against the sepulchre and watch until He rise again, for rise
   again He will; but whether He live or die, where He is there shall his
   servant be.' Ho, then, brave spirits, will ye enlist for Christ when
   His banner is tattered? Will you enlist under Him when His armor is
   stained with blood? Will you rally to Him even when they report Him
   slain? Happy shall ye be! Your loyalty shall be proven to your own
   eternal glory. Ye are soldiers such as He loves to honor.

   Ittai gave himself up wholly to David when he was but newly come to
   him, David says, Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day
   make thee go up and down with us? But Ittai does not care whether he
   came yesterday or twenty years ago, but he declares, Surely in what
   place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there
   also will thy servant be.' It is best to begin the Christian life with
   thorough consecration. Have any of you professed to be Christians, and
   have you never given yourselves entirely to Christ? It is time that you
   began again. This should be one of the earliest forms of our worship of
   our Master'this total resignation of ourselves to Him. According to His
   Word, the first announcement of our faith should be by baptism, and the
   meaning of baptism, or immersion in water, is death, burial, and
   resurrection. As far as this point is concerned, the avowal is just
   this. I am henceforth dead to all but Christ, whose servant I now am.
   Henceforth let no man trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of
   the Lord Jesus. The watermark is on me from head to foot. I have been
   buried with Him in baptism unto death to show that henceforth I belong
   to Him.' Now, whether you have been baptized or not I leave to
   yourselves, but in any case this must be true'that henceforth you are
   dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. As soon as ever Christ
   is yours you ought to be Christ's. I am my Beloved's' should be linked
   with My Beloved is mine,' in the dawn of the day in which you yield to
   the Lord.

   Again, Ittai surrendered himself to David in the most voluntary manner.
   No one persuaded Ittai to do this; in fact, David seems to have
   persuaded him the other way. David tested and tried him, but he
   voluntarily out of the fullness of his heart said, Where, my lord, the
   king, is, there, also shall his servant be.' Now, dear young people, if
   you believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is yours, give yourselves up to
   Him by a distinct act and deed. Feel that one grand impulse without
   needing pressure or argument'The love of Christ constraineth me'; but
   do not wait to have your duty urged upon you, for the more free the
   dedication the more acceptable it will be. I am told that there is no
   wine so delicious as that which flows from the grape at the first
   gentle pressure. The longer you squeeze the harsher is the juice. We do
   not like that service which is pressed out of a man: and certainly the
   Lord of love will not accept forced labor. No; let your willinghood
   show itself. Say'

   Take myself, and I will be

   Ever, only, ALL for thee.

   My heart pants after the service after of her Lord. With the same
   spontaneity which Ittai displayed make a solemn consecration of
   yourselves to David's Lord.

   I used a word then which suggests another point, namely, that Ittai did
   this very solemnly. He took an oath which we Christians may not do, and
   may not wish to do, but still we should make the surrender with quite
   as much solemnity. In Dr. Doddridge's Rise and Progress of Religion in
   the Soul' there is a very solemn form of consecration, which he
   recommends voting men to sign when they give themselves to Christ. I
   cannot say that I can recommend it, though I practiced it, for I fear
   that there is something of legality about it, and that it may bring the
   soul into bondage. I have known some write out a deed of dedication to
   Christ and sign it with their blood. I will neither commend nor
   censure, but I will say that a complete dedication must be made in some
   manner, and that it should be done deliberately and with grave thought.
   You have been bought with a price, and you should, therefore, in a
   distinct manner own your Lord's property in you, and transfer to Him
   the title-deeds of your body, spirit, and soul.

   And this, I think, Ittai did publicly. At any rate, he so acted that
   everybody saw him when David said, Go over,' and march in front'the
   first man to pass the brook, Oh yes, dear friend, you must publicly own
   yourself a Christian. If you are a Christian you must not try to sneak
   to heaven round the back alleys, but march up the narrow way like a man
   and like your Master. He was never ashamed of you, though He might have
   been: how can you be ashamed of Him when there is nothing in Him to be
   ashamed of? Some Christians seem to think that they shall lead an
   easier life if they never make a profession. Like a rat behind the
   wainscot they come out after candlelight and get a crumb, and then slip
   back again. I would not lead such a life. Surely, there is nothing to
   be ashamed of. A Christian'let us glory in the name! A believer in the
   Lord Jesus Christ'let them write it on our door plates, if they will.
   Why should we blush at that? But,' says one, I would rather be a very
   quiet one.' I will now place a torpedo under this cowardly quietness.
   What saith the Lord Jesus? Whosoever shall deny me before net,, him
   will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven; but he that shall
   confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which
   is in heaven.' Take up your cross and follow Him, for with the heart
   man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made
   unto salvation.' When our Master ascended up on high He told us to
   preach the gospel to every creature; and how did He put it? He that
   believeth and is baptized shall be saved.' There must be, therefore,
   the believing and the acknowledgment of believing. But cannot I be
   saved as a believer if I do not openly confess Christ?' Dear friend,
   you have no business to tamper with your Master's command, and then
   say, Will He not graciously forgive this omission?' Do not neglect one
   of the two commands, but obey all His will. If you have the spirit of
   Ittai you will say, Wheresoever my lord the king is, there also shall
   thy servant be.'

   I leave the matter with the consciences of those who may be like
   Nicodemus, coming to Jesus by night, or may be like Joseph of
   Arimathea, who was a disciple, but secretly, for fear of the Jews. May
   they come out and own their Master, believing that then He will own
   them.

   II.Secondly, WHAT DID THIS DECLARATION INVOLVE? As to Ittai, what did
   it involve?

   First, that he was henceforth to be David's servant. Of course, as his
   soldier, he was to fight for him, and to do his bidding. What sayest
   thou, man? Canst thou lift thy hand to Christ, and say, Henceforth I
   will live as thy servant, not doing my own will, but thy will. Thy
   command is henceforth my rule?' Canst thou say that? If not, do not
   mock Him, but stand back. May the Holy Ghost give thee grace thus to
   begin, thus to perservre, and thus to end.

   It involved, next, for Ittai that he was to do his utmost for David's
   cause, not to be his servant in name, but his soldier, ready for scars
   and wounds and death, if need be, on the king's behalf. That is what
   Ittai meant as, in tough soldier-tones, he took the solemn oath that it
   should be so. Now, if thou wouldst be Christ's disciple, determine
   henceforth by His grace that thou wilt defend His cause; that if there
   be rough fighting thou wilt be in it; and if there be a forlorn hope
   needed thou wilt lead it, and go through floods and flames if thy
   Master's cause shall call thee. Blessed is the man who will follow the
   Lamb whithersoever He goeth, giving himself wholly up to his Lord to
   serve Him with all His heart.

   But Ittai in his promise declared that he would give a personal
   attendance upon the person of his master. That was, indeed, the pith of
   it, In what place my lord, the king, shall be, even there also will thy
   servant be.' Brethren, let us make the same resolve in our hearts, that
   wherever Christ is, there we will be. Where is Christ? In heaven. We
   will be there by-and-by. Where is He here, spiritually? Answer: in His
   church. The church is a body of faithful men; and where these are met
   together, there is Jesus in the midst of them. Very well, then, we will
   join the church, for wherever our Lord, the King, is, there also shall
   His servants be. When the list of the redeemed is read we will be found
   in the register, for our Lord's name is there.

   Where else did Jesus go? In the commencement of His ministry He
   descended into the waters of baptism. Let us follow the Lamb
   whithersoever He goeth. At the close of His ministry He brake bread,
   and said, This do ye in remembrance of me.' Be often at His table, for
   if there is a place on the earth where He manifests Himself to His
   children it is where bread is broken in His name. Let me now tell a
   secret. Some of you may have heard it before, but you have forgotten
   it. Here it is'my Lord it generally here at prayer-meetings on Monday
   nights, and, indeed, whenever His people come together for prayer,
   there He is. So I will read you my text, and see ether you will come up
   to it'Surely in what place my Lord the King shall be, whether it be in
   a prayer-meeting or at a sermon, even there also will thy servant be.
   If you love your Lord, you know where His haunts are; take care that
   you follow hard after Him there.

   Where is the Lord Jesus Christ? Well, brethren, He is wherever the
   truth is, and I pray God that He may raise up a race of men and women
   in England who are determined to be wherever the truth of God is. We
   have a host of molluscous creatures about who will always be where the
   congregation is the most respectable: respectability being measured by
   clothes and cash. Time was in the church of God when they most esteemed
   the most pious men; has it come to this that gold takes precedence of
   grace? Our fathers considered whether a ministry was sound, but now the
   question is'Is the man clever? Words ire preferred to truth, and
   oratory takes the lead of the gospel. Shame on such an age. O you who
   have, not altogether sold your birthrights, I charge you keep out of
   this wretched declension.

   The man who loves Christ thoroughly will say, Wheresoever the Lord the
   King is, there also shall His servant be, if it be with half a dozen
   poor Baptists or Methodists, or among the most despised people in the
   town.' I charge you, beloved, in whatever town or country your lot is
   cast, be true to your colors, and never forsake your principles.
   Wherever the truth is, there go, and where there is anything contrary
   to truth, do not go, for there your Master is not to be found.

   What next? Well, our Master is to be found wherever there is anything
   to be done for the good of our fellow-men. The Lord Jesus Christ is to
   be found wherever there is work to be done in seeking after His lost
   sheep. Some people say that they have very little communion with
   Christ, and when I look at them, I do not wonder. Two persons cannot
   walk together if they will not walk at the same pace. Now, my Lord
   walks an earnest pace whenever He goes through the world, for the
   King's business requires haste; and if His disciples crawl after a
   snail's fashion they will lose His company. If some of our groaning
   brethren would go to the Sunday-school, and there begin to look after
   the little children, they would meet with their Lord who used to say,
   Suffer the little children to come unto me.' If others were to get
   together a little meeting, and teach the ignorant, they would there
   find Him who had compassion on the ignorant on those that are out of
   the way. Our Master is where there are fetters to be broken, burdens to
   be removed, and hearts to be comforted, and if you wish to keep with
   Him you must aid in such service.

   Where is our Master? Well, He is always on the side of truth and right.
   And, O, you Christian people, mind that in everything@politics,
   business, and everything you keep to that which is right, ]lot to that
   which is popular. Do not bow the knee to that which for a little day
   may be cried up, but stand fast in that which is consistent with
   rectitude, with humanity, with the cause and honor of God, and with the
   freedom and progress of men. It can never be wise to do wrong. It can
   never be foolish to be right. It can never be according to the mind of
   Christ to tyrannize and to oppress. Keep you ever to whatsoever things
   are pure and lovely and of good report, and you will so far keep with
   Christ. Temperance, purity, justice-these are favorites with Him; do
   your best to advance them for His sake.

   Above all, remember how Jesus loved secret prayer, and if you resolve
   to keep with Him you must be much at the throne of grace.

   I will not detain you over each of these points, but simply say that
   Ittai's declaration meant also this'that he intended to share David's
   condition. If David was great, Ittai would rejoice. If David was
   exiled, Ittai would attend his wanderings. Our point must be to resolve
   in God's strength to keep to Christ in all weathers and in all
   companies, and that whether in life or death. Ah that word death' makes
   it sweet, because then we reap the blessed result of having lived with
   Christ. We shall go upstairs for the last time and bid good-bye to all,
   and then we shall feel that in death He is still with us as in life we
   have been with Him. Though our good works can never be a ground of
   confidence when we are dying, yet if the Lord enables us to follow the
   Lamb whithersoever He goeth, and so to lead a decided, positive,
   downright, upright Christian life, our death pillow will not be stuffed
   with thorns of regret, but we shall have to bless God that we bore a
   faithful witness as far as were able to do so. In such a case we shall
   not when the dying wish to go back again to rectify the mistakes and
   insincerities of our lives. No, beloved, it will be very, very sweet to
   be alone with Jesus in death. He will make all our bed in our sickness;
   He will make our dying pillow soft, and our soul shall vanish, kissed
   away by His dear lips, and we shall be with Him forever and forever. Of
   those that are nearest to Him it is said, These are they that follow
   the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. They shall walk with him in white, for
   they are worthy.'

   I conclude with this observation. Will our Lord Jesus Christ accept at
   our hands tonight such a consecrating word? If we are trusting in Him
   for salvation will He permit us to say that we will keep with Him as
   long as we live?

   We reply, He will not permit us to say it in our own strength. There
   was a young man who said, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou
   goest,' but Christ gave him a cool reception: and there was an older
   man who said, Though all men shall forsake thee yet will not I,' and in
   reply his Master prayed for Him that his faith should not fail. Now,
   you must not promise as Peter did, or you will make a greater failure.
   But, beloved, this self-devotion is what Christ expects of us if we are
   His disciples. He will not have us love father or mother more than Him;
   we must be ready to give up all for His sake. This is not only what our
   Master expects from us, but what He deserves from us.

   Love so amazing, so divine,

   Demands my soul, my life, my all.

   This, also, is what the Lord will help us to do, for He will give us
   grace if we will but seek it at His hands: and this it is which He will
   graciously reward, and has already rewarded, in that choice word of His
   in the twelfth of John, where He says of His disciples in the
   twenty-sixth verse, If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I
   am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my
   Father honor.' Oh, to be honored of God in eternity when He shall say,
   Stand back, angels; make way, seraphim and cherubim; here comes a man
   that suffered for the sake, of my dear Son. Here comes one that was not
   ashamed of my Only-begotten when his face was smeared with the spittle.
   Here comes one that stood in the pillory with Jesus, and was called ill
   names for His sake. Stand back, ye angels, these have greater honor
   than you.' Surely the angels of heaven as they traverse the streets of
   gold and meet the martyrs will ask them about their sufferings, and
   say, You are more favored than we, for you have had the privilege of
   suffering and dying for the Lord.' O brothers and sisters, snatch at
   the privilege of living for Jesus; consecrate yourselves this day unto
   Him; live from this hour forward, not to enrich yourselves, nor to gain
   honor and esteem, but for Jesus, for Jesus alone. Oh, if I could set
   Him before you here; if I could cause Him to stand on this platform
   just as He came from Gethsemane with His bloody sweat about Him, or as
   He came down from the cross with wounds so bright with glory and so
   fresh with bleeding out our redemption, I think I should hear you say,
   each one of you, Lord Jesus, we are thine, and in what place Thou shalt
   be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servants be.' So
   may the Lord help us by His most gracious Spirit who hath wrought all
   our works in us, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

  LETTER FROM MR. SPURGEON.

   BELOVED FRIENDS,'The Lord has been graciously pleased to release his
   prisoner. I am weak, but the pain is gone, and in this land of bright
   sun and warm air I expect soon to recover strength. If my hopes are
   fulfilled, I shall have escaped this time with a lighter measure of
   chastening than for several previous years, and for this I feel doubly
   grateful. To all those by whose prayers I have been comforted and
   blessed I return hearty thanks.

   Special services are commencing at the Tabernacle, and I entreat
   friends at home to throw their whole souls into them. I also beg my
   readers to pray that my beloved work at home may not suffer through my
   absence, but that it may please God through these special services to
   revive nd increase the spiritual life of the church committed to my
   care. Then will all the agencies be quickened also, and great blessing
   will come to the people of God.

   Unto the Lord our God belong the issues from death, and he restoreth
   our soul. To Him be glory for ever.

   With love to all the saints, yours,

   A Sermon

   (No. 1513)

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   And Josiah set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the
   service of the house of the Lord'2 Chronicles 35:2.

   JOSIAH, as you remember, in the early part of his reign set his face
   against the idolatries that prevailed, to root them out of the land. He
   then bent his thoughts upon repairing and beautifying the temple. After
   that it was his heart's aim to restore the sacred services, to observe
   the solemn feasts, and to revive the worship of God after the due
   order, according to the words of the book of the covenant that was
   found in the house of the Lord. Our text tells us something of the
   method with which he went to work; and it may well serve us as a model.

   The first thing is to get every man into his proper place; the next
   thing is for every man to have a good spirit in his present place, so
   as to occupy it worthily. I will suppose, dear friends, that in the
   providence of God you are in your place, and that by the direction of
   God's Spirit you have also sought and found the precise form of
   usefulness in which you ought to exercise yourself. To-night it shall
   not be my business to arrange you; but assuming that it is well for you
   to keep where you are, my object shall be to encourage you to do your
   work for your Lord without being cast down. I am hardly going to preach
   so much as to talk to different persons who are discouraged in the work
   of the Lord, that we may rouse them up, rally them round us, and
   encourage them to keep rank.

   I. And, first, I would speak a little to THOSE WHO THINK THAT THEY CAN
   DO NOTHING. They will tell me that in such a sermon not a sentence can
   concern them: if I am to encourage men to the service of the house of
   the Lord, it will be in vain for them, as they can do nothing at all.
   Well, dear friends, you must not take that for granted; you must make
   quite sure that you cannot do anything before I may venture to speak to
   you as if it were a matter of fact; for sometimes there is a want of
   way because there is a want of will. Though I do not go so far as to
   allege that this is your case, we know too well that cannot' often does
   mean will not,' and not to have triumphed may mean that you have not
   tried. You have been so discouraged that you have excused yourself for
   inaction, and your inaction has grown into indolence. If a man, under
   the notion that he could not lift his right hand, constantly kept it
   still, I should not wonder if, after weeks and months, it would become
   a matter of fact that he had not the power to use it. It might actually
   stiffen for no reason but because he had not moved it. Do you not think
   that, before your muscles get rigid, it would be well to exercise them
   by attempting some kind of service? Especially you younger folk, if you
   do not work for the Lord almost as soon as you are converted it will be
   very difficult afterwards to make you take to it. Aptitude, I have
   often noticed, comes with employment, and through negligence and sloth
   people become enervated and helpless. You say that you cannot move your
   arm, and so you do not move it; take heed, for by-and-by your pretence
   will become the parent of real powerlessness.

   But I will take what you have said as being true. You are ill; the
   vigour you felt in the bright days of health fails you now; you have to
   suffer pain, weariness, and exhaustion; you are often detained at home;
   and home seems now to you a gloomy hospital all the day long, rather
   than a genial hostelry when evening shadows fall. Little indeed,
   therefore, can you do; so little that you are apt to reckon it as
   nothing at all. The thought is a burden to you. You wish you could
   serve the Lord. How constantly you have dreamed of the pleasure since
   you have been denied the privilege! How willing your feet would be to
   run; how ready your hands would be to labour; how glad would your
   tongue be to testify! You envy those who are able, and you would fain
   emulate and excel them; not indeed that you harbour ill-will against
   them, but you devoutly wish that you could do some personal service in
   the cause of your Master.

   Now, I want to encourage you first by reminding you that the law of the
   Son of David is the same as the law of David himself; and you know the
   law of David about those that went to the battle. There were some that
   were lame, and some that were otherwise incapable of action, and he
   left them with the baggage. There,' he said, you are very weary and
   ill: stop in the camp: take care of the tents, and the ammunition,
   while we go and fight.' Now, it happened once on a time that the men
   that went to fight claimed all the spoil. They said, These people have
   done nothing: they have been lying in the trenches: they shall not
   carry off a share of the booty.' But King David there and then made a
   law that they should share and share equally'those that were in the
   trenches and those that engaged in the fray. As his part is that goeth
   down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff:
   they shall part alike. And it was so from that day forward, that he
   made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel.' Nor is the law of the
   Son of David less gracious. If by sickness you are detained at home,'if
   for any other reason, such as age or infirmity, you are not able to
   enter into actual service, yet if you are a true soldier and would
   fight if you could, and your heart is in it, you shall share even with
   the best and bravest of those who, clad in the panoply of God,
   encounter and grapple with the adversary.

   And, brethren, you have no reason to envy, though you may admire to
   your heart's content, all who are diligent and successful in the
   service of Christ. Let me remind you of a law of the kingdom of heaven
   with which you are all familiar'He that receiveth a prophet in the name
   of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward.' In truth, it is a
   splendid appointment to be a servant of the Lord. David thought so, for
   you often read at the commencement of his psalms'A prayer of David, the
   servant of God,' though you never read, A prayer of David, the king of
   Israel,' for he thought more of being enrolled a servant of God than of
   being entitled a king of Israel. Health and strength, ability and
   opportunity to fulfil a mission for the Master are much to be desired,
   but these are not always to be taken as reliable evidence of personal
   salvation. A man may preach admirably, and he may work marvels in the
   church, and yet himself not be a partaker of saving grace. Hence, when
   the disciples came back from preaching, and said, Lord, even the devils
   are subject to us through thy name,' the Lord said, Never the less, in
   this rejoice not, but rather rejoice because your names are written in
   heaven.' Judas was amongst them; Judas cast out devils; Judas preached
   the gospel; and yet Judas was a son of perdition, and is lost for ever.
   Because you cannot do much you must not infer that therefore you are
   not saved; for if you were to be among the chief of Christian workers
   it would not prove that you were certainly a child of God. Do not fret,
   then, because you are shut out from the cheerful activities in which
   others share; for, as long as your name is written in heaven, and your
   heart truly follows after the Lord, you shall have an abundant
   recompense at the last great day, even though here you are doomed to be
   a sufferer rather than a worker.

   But to me it seems more than possible that some of you, dear friends,
   whose minds are tinged with melancholy, have painted your own lot in
   deeper shades than the justice of the case deserves. Is your life
   indeed a dull routine, which, for lack of busy change and lively
   enterprise, leaves no record behind? Not so, methinks. The rich relics
   of a well-spent hour' do sometimes pour around your path a stream of
   light that cheers our eyes, though it may escape your notice. Are you
   patient under your sufferings? Do you try to keep the flesh in
   subjection, to govern your spirit, to refrain from murmuring, and to
   foster cheerfulness? That, my friend, is doing a great deal. I am sure
   that the holy serenity of a suffering child of God is one of the best
   sermons that can ever be preached in a family. A sick saint has often
   been more serviceable in a house than the most eloquent divine could
   have been. They see how sweetly you submit to the divine will, how
   patiently you can bear painful operations, how the Lord gives you songs
   in the night. Why, you are greatly useful. I have sometimes been called
   to visit bedridden persons who have been unable to rise for many, many
   years, and it has been within my knowledge that their influence has
   extended over whole parishes. They have been known as poor pious women
   or as experienced Christian men, and many have gone to visit them.
   Christian ministers have said that they derived more benefit from
   sitting half-an-hour talking to poor old Betsy than they did from all
   the books in their library, and yet Betsy said that she was doing
   nothing. Look at your case in that light, and you will see that you can
   praise God upon your bed, and make your chamber to be as vocal for God
   as this pulpit ever can be.

   Besides, dear friends, do you not think we frequently limit our
   estimate of serving God to the public exercises of the sanctuary, and
   forget the strong claims that our Lord has upon our private fidelity
   and obedience? You say, I cannot serve God,' when you cannot teach in
   the school or preach in the pulpit, when you are unable to sit on a
   committee or speak on a platform: as if these were the only forms of
   service to be taken into account. Do you not think that a mother
   nursing her baby is serving God? Do you not think that men and women
   going about their daily toil with patient industry discharging the
   duties of domestic life are serving God? If you think rightly you will
   understand that they are. The servant sweeping the room, the mistress
   preparing the meal, the workman driving a nail, the merchant casting up
   his ledger, ought to do all in the service of God. Though, of course,
   it is very desirable that we should each and all have some definitely
   religious work before us, yet it is much better that we should hallow
   our common handicraft, and make our ordinary work chime with the
   melodies of a soul attuned for heaven. Let true religion be our life,
   and then our life will be true religion. That is how it ought to be.
   Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all in the name of the
   Lord Jesus, giving thanks unto God and the Father by him.' So, then,
   let the stream of your common life as it flows on, obscure, unobserved,
   be holy and courageous; you will find that while they also serve who
   only stand and wait,' you shall not be neglected or overlooked who
   simply sit at Jesus' feet and listen to his words when you can do no
   more. This is service done for him which he can appreciate; complain
   who may.

   Know, too, my dear sister, that by thy sorrows the Lord has drawn out
   thy sympathies. Thou, my dear brother, know that by the discipline
   which has chastened thee, thou hast learned to be a comforter. Say you,
   then, that you cannot do anything? I know a few secrets about you that
   you forget. You do not reckon yourself up as we reckon you. Did you not
   try to cheer a poor neighbour the other day by telling of the Lord's
   goodness to you when you were very sick yourself? How started from your
   eye that tear most sacred shed for a fellow-creature's pain? Is it not
   your habit, poor sufferer as you are, to let drop just a few words for
   your Master to others in a like condition whenever you can? You tell me
   that you cannot do anything. Why, dear hearts, the refreshing of God's
   saints is one of the highest works in which anyone can be occupied. God
   will send prophets to his servants at times when they need to be
   rebuked; if he wants to comfort them he generally sends an angel to
   them, for that is angel's work. Jesus Christ himself, we read, had
   angels sent to minister to him. When? Was it not in the garden of
   Gethsemane, when he was bowed down with sorrow? Comforting is not
   ordinary work: it is a kind of angelic work. There appeared unto him an
   angel strengthening him.' A prophet was sent to warn the Israelites of
   their sin; but when a Gideon was to be encouraged to go and fight for
   his country, it was the angel of the Lord that came to him. So I gather
   that comforting work is angel's work. You, dear kind Christian men and
   women, who think that you are not able to do anything but to condole or
   to console with cheery words some souls cast down and sore dismayed,
   you are fulfilling a most blessed office, and doing work which many
   ministers find it difficult to perform. I have known some who have
   never known suffering or ill-health, and when they try to comfort God's
   weary people they are dreadfully awkward over it. They are like
   elephants picking up pins: they can do it, but it is with a wonderful
   effort. God's tried people comfort each other con amore; they take to
   the work as a fish to water. They understand the art of speaking a word
   in season to him that is weary, and when this is the case they may not
   complain that they are doing nothing.

   And yet, beloved, you who thought that you did nothing, and now
   perceive that you are really useful, will, I hope, perceive that there
   is still a wider region into which you may advance. Breathe to-night
   the prayer of Jabez, who was more honourable than his brethren, because
   he was the child of his mother's sorrow; and this was the prayer'Oh
   that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast'! Ask God to
   open up to you a larger region of usefulness, and he will do it.

   II. Now let me address a few words to another class of workers WHO
   THINK THAT THEY ARE LAID ASIDE.

   Dear sir,' says one, I wish you would encourage me. I used to be useful
   once; at least, I was recognized as one of a band of men who worked
   together right heartily, but since I have changed my residence I am
   unknown in the neighborhood where I am living, and I seem to have
   dropped out of the ranks. I have done little or nothing lately, and I
   feel uneasy about it. I wish that I could get to work.' My dear
   brother, I hope you will; but do not waste five minutes in thinking it
   over. These times need so much Christian effort that when a man asks
   me, How shall I do work for Christ'? I am accustomed to say, Go and do
   it.' But what is the way to do it'? Start at once. Get at it, my
   brother. Do not be out of harness a minute. But suppose that you are
   obliged to desist awhile, do not let your interest in the cause of our
   Lord and Master decline. Some of the best of God's workers have been
   laid aside for long periods. Moses was forty years in the desert, doing
   nothing. A greater than he, our blessed Saviour himself, was thirty
   years,'I will not say doing nothing, but certainly doing no public
   work. When you are in a retired and inactive position, be preparing for
   the time when God brings you out again. If you are put away on the
   shelf, do not rust there, but pray the Master to brighten you up so
   that when he comes to use you again you may be fully fitted for the
   work which he has in hand for you.

   While you must be laid aside, I want you to do this,'pray for others
   that are at work. Help them; encourage them. Do not get into that
   peevish, miserable frame of mind which grudges and undervalues other
   men's works. Be not like the dog in the manger. Some people, when they
   cannot do anything themselves, do not like anybody else to be diligent
   and laborious. Say, If I cannot help, I will never hinder, but I will
   cheer my brethren.'

   Spend your time in prayer that you may be fit for the Master's use,
   and, meanwhile, be prompt in helping others. You remember that, at the
   siege of Gibraltar, when the fleet surrounded it and determined to
   storm the old rock, the governor fired red-hot shot down upon the men
   of war. The enemy did not at all admire the governor's warm reception.
   Think how it was done. Here were gunners on the ramparts firing away,
   and every man in the garrison would have liked to do the same. What did
   those do who could not serve a gun? Why, they heated the shot; and that
   is what you must do. I am master gunner here generally: heat my shot
   for me, if you will. Keep the furnace going, so that when we do fire
   off a sermon it may be red-hot, through your earnest prayers. When you
   see your friends sitting in the Sunday-school, or standing out in the
   street working for God, if you cannot join them yet say, Never mind: I
   will heat the shot for them. My prayers shall not be wanting, if I can
   contribute nothing else.' That is counsel for you who are for awhile
   laid on the shelf.

   III. Others there are who are much discouraged because THEY HAVE BUT
   SMALL TALENT. Oh,' they say, I wish I could serve Jesus Christ like
   Paul, or like Whitefield'that I could range the country through
   proclaiming his dear name and winning thousands of converts. But I am
   slow of speech and dull of thought, and what I attempt produces little
   or no effect.' Well, brother, mind that you do what you can. Do you not
   recollect the parable of the men who had talents entrusted to them? I
   do not want to lay undue stress upon the fact that it was the man who
   had one talent who buried it. Yet why is he represented as doing so? I
   think it was not because the men of two and five talents do not
   sometimes bury theirs, but because the temptation lies most with the
   one talent people. They say, What can I do? What is the use of me? I
   may be excused.' That is the temptation. Brother, do not be entangled
   in that snare. If your Lord has only given you one talent he does not
   expect you to make the same interest upon it as the man does with five;
   but still he does expect his interest, and therefore do not wrap your
   talent in a napkin. It is but with strength imparted that any of us can
   serve him. We have nothing to consecrate to him but the gift we have
   first received from him. You are weak. You feel it; but what says your
   God to you? Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the
   Lord.' He can make you useful though you have no extraordinary
   endowments. Grape-shot may do great execution, though it cannot compare
   with grenade or bomb-shell. A sinner may be brought to Christ by the
   simple earnestness of a peasant or an artisan, without calling in the
   aid of a professor's learning or a preacher's eloquence. God can bless
   you far above what you think to be your capacity, for it is not a
   question of your ability but of his aid. You have no self-reliance, you
   tell me. Then take refuge in God, I entreat you, for you evidently want
   more of the divine succor. Go and get it; it is to be had. He girds the
   weak with strength. The young men shall faint and be weary, but they
   that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.' Why, I think you
   are more likely to do good than if you had five talents, for now you
   will pray more and you will depend more upon God than you would have
   done if you had possessed strength of your own.

   One other word. As you are not enriched with many talents, mind you
   economize those you have. Do you know how merchants and tradesmen who
   have only a small capital in business manage to compete with those who
   have larger means? They try to turn their money over every day. The
   costermonger cannot afford to deal out his goods to gentlemen who will
   pay him in three months. Not he. He must get his ready money at the
   door, and then go and buy another stock to-morrow morning, and turn it
   over, or else he could not pick up his living with so small a capital.
   If you have only ninepence, make it nimble,' and you will get as much
   profit out of a nimble ninepence as another out of a lazy crown.
   Activity often makes up for lack of ability. If you cannot get force by
   the weight of the ball, get it by the velocity with which it travels. A
   little man with one talent all ablaze may become a perfect nuisance to
   the devil, and a champion for Christ. As for that great divine with his
   five talents, who marches on so sleepily, Satan can always overmatch
   him and win the day. If you can but turn over your one talent again and
   again, in the name of God, you may achieve great wonders. So I would
   encourage you in the work of the Lord.

   IV. With workers WHO ARE UNDER GREAT DIFFICULTIES I would now have a
   word. I have known the day when perplexities pleased me, dilemmas
   afforded me delight, and instead of declining a difficult task I rather
   like it. Even now I enjoy puzzling over a problem, and attempting what
   others decline. Nothing good in this world can be effected without
   difficulty. The biggest diamonds lie under heavy stones which sluggards
   cannot turn over. That which is easy to do is hardly worth doing. In
   the face of difficulty the man of ardent, persevering spirit braces up
   his nerves, sharpens his wits, and brings all his powers into play to
   achieve an object that will reward his efforts. Have you great
   difficulties dear friend? You are not the first worker for God who has
   had difficulties to encounter. Let us go back to Moses again. He was to
   bring Israel out of Egypt; but his path did not appear very plain. He
   must go before Pharaoh and issue God's command. Pharaoh looked him
   through when he said, Let my people go.' The haughty monarch was
   greatly surprised to hear anybody, especially a Hebrew, talk like that;
   and so he bade him begone. But Moses returns with, Thus saith the Lord,
   Let my people go'; and his courage was not even then crowned with
   immediate success. There must be plague upon plague, plague upon
   plague, till at last proud Pharaoh's heart was broken, the Israelites
   were saved from the hand of him that hated them; and Egypt was glad
   when they departed. This, however, was but the beginning of the mission
   of Moses. His was a life of difficulty'the meekest man, but the most
   provoked; and until he got to the top of Pisgah, and his gracious
   Master kissed away his soul, the prophet of Horeb had never done with
   difficulties. Any good thing, I say, especially any good thing done for
   God, must be surrounded with difficulties, and resisted by adversaries.
   Look at Nehemiah, and Ezra, and Zerubbabel, and those that built
   Jerusalem, the second time. These good men wrought zealously, but
   Sanballat and Tobiah were jeering and jesting, and trying to throw down
   the wall. If you build a city without difficulty, it is not Jerusalem.
   Be sure of that. As soon as ever you begin working for God you will
   find a great power working against you. If you encounter opposition,
   take it as a good sign. When our young men go to a provincial town to
   preach, and I want to know how they are getting on, after listening to
   their story, I ask, Has somebody slandered you yet? Do the newspapers
   denounce you as a fool'? If they say No,' I conclude that they are not
   getting on much. If Christ's cause is prospering the world will
   reproach the soul-winner; if you do damage to the devil's kingdom he
   will roar at you. Should your course be smooth, it is because he says,
   There is nothing to disturb me in that man's monotonous talk. I need
   not let fly the fiery dart of calumny at him: he is a chip in the
   porridge, I will let him alone.' Such a man generally goes through life
   very comfortably. People say, He is a quiet, inoffensive sort of man.'
   We do not want such soldiers in the service of Christ. What a
   disagreeable person'! said a king once of an officer whose sword
   rattled on the floor. That sword of his is most offensive.' Sire,' said
   the officer, that is exactly what your majesty's enemies think.' When
   ungodly persons say that we are troublesome, we are not broken-hearted
   at being out of their good looks. If the king's enemies think us
   troublesome, we reckon it to be high praise. When you, my dear brother,
   meet with opposition, encounter it with prayer. Exercise more faith.
   Antagonists ought never to hinder your going forward in the cause of
   Christ. Diamond must cut diamond. There is nothing so hard in this
   world but you can cut it with something harder. If you ask God to steel
   your soul up to the conquering point, and to make your resolution like
   an adamant stone, you can cut your way through an alp of diamond in the
   service of your Lord and Master.

   Let me inspirit you in the face of assailants. The forces ranged
   against you might be stumbling-blocks to fools, but they shall only
   prove a stimulus to men. One day your honour shall be the greater and
   your reward shall be the higher because of these adverse elements.
   Therefore, be brave and fear not, but advance in the strength of God.

   V. Fain would I now speak a passing word of comfort to another class of
   workers'THOSE THAT ARE NOT APPRECIATED. I am not going to say much,
   because I have not much sympathy with them. Yet I know that the
   smallest slight chafes those who are over sensitive. They murmur, I do
   my best, and nobody thanks me.' You think yourself a martyr, and
   complain that you are mis-represented. Be it so, dear friend; that was
   your Master's lot, and it is the lot of all his servants. This is a
   cross we must all carry, or we shall never wear the crown. Do you fancy
   that this is a new experience? Look at Joseph. His brethren could not
   bear him, and yet it was he that saved the family and fed them in time
   of famine. Look at David. His brothers asked why he had left the charge
   of the sheep to come down to the battle, suspecting that the pride of
   his heart had brought him among the soldiers and the standards. Yet
   nobody could bring back Goliath's head but that young David. Take a
   lesson from the ruddy hero; take no notice of what your brethren say
   about you. Go and bring back the giant's head. A good adventure is the
   best answer to evil accusations. If you are serving the Master let
   their scandal stir you up to more self-consecration. If they cry out
   against you as too forward, serve the Lord with more vigour, and you
   will antidote the venom of their tongues. Did you enter into Christ's
   work in order to be honoured among men? Then retire from it, for you
   came with a bad motive. But if you enlisted purely to bring honour to
   Him, and to win his smile, what more do you want? What more do you
   want? Be not therefore disheartened because you are not applauded. Be
   certain of this, that to be kept in the rear rank is often necessary to
   future eminence. If you take a man and put him in front, and pat him on
   the back and say, What a great man he is'! he will make a false step
   before long, and there will be an end of your hero; but when a man is
   brought forward by God, he is often one whom everybody criticizes,
   finds fault with, and declaims as an impostor, but the banter he is
   exposed to serves as ballast for his mind. When he comes off with
   success he will not be spoiled with conceit, for the grace of God will
   make him bow with gratitude. The sword that is meant for a princely
   hand, to split through skull and backbone in the day of battle, must be
   annealed in the furnace again and again; it cannot be fit for such
   desperate work until it has passed through the fire full many a time.
   Do not ask to be appreciated. Never be so mean as that. Appreciate
   yourself in the serenity of conscience, and leave your honour with your
   God.

   VI. I must speak now, in the last place, a little more at length to
   THOSE WHO ARE DISCOURAGED BECAUSE THEY HAVE HAD SO LITTLE SUCCESS.

   It was my great delight a few evenings ago to meet a splendid band of
   men and women who are the Sunday-school teachers of this church. You
   will think it strange that I did not till then thoroughly estimate the
   extent of their work, as I had never added up the total of the various
   schools; but when I did so, and found that they mounted up to six
   thousand children, I felt full of joy. I shall run over with delight if
   they increase to twelve thousand in another twelve months. For so large
   a district this would not be too many, but still our present number is
   most encouraging. Now, I know that some of our teachers are working
   away in back streets, in rooms not connected with any place but this,
   and we hardly knew of them, because they were pursuing their simple,
   unobtrusive labours so quietly. Are there any of you who fear that you
   have toiled in vain and spent your strength for nought? I would entreat
   you, dear friends, not to be satisfied with casting in the seed unless
   you reap some good results; yet do not be so faint-hearted as to give
   up because of a little disappointment. Though you cannot be satisfied
   without fruit, yet do not cease to sow because one season proves a
   failure. I would not have our friends the farmers abandon agriculture
   because this year they have a bad crop: if they were to measure their
   future prospects by the present failure, it would be a great pity. If
   you have preached or taught, or done work for Christ with little
   success until now, do not infer that you will always be unsuccessful.
   Regret the lack of prosperity but do not relinquish the labour of
   seeking it. You may reasonably be sorrowful, but you have no right to
   despair. Non-success is a trial of faith which has been endured by many
   a trusty servant who has been triumphant in the issue. Did not the
   disciples toil all night, and catch nothing? Did we not read just now
   of some who cast the net, and yet took no fish? Did not our Lord say
   that some seed would fall on stony ground, and some among the thorns,
   and that from these there would be no harvest? What good did Jeremiah
   do? I have no doubt he laboured, and God blessed him, but the result of
   his preaching was that he said, The bellows are burned in the fire.' He
   had blown up the fire till he had burnt the bellows, but no man's heart
   was melted. Woe is me'! said he. Oh that my head were waters, and mine
   eyes a fountain of tears'! I do not know what was the result of Noah's
   ministry, but I do know that he was a preacher of righteousness for a
   hundred and twenty years, and yet he never brought a soul into the ark
   except his own family. Poor preaching we may count it judging by the
   influence it exerted: and yet we know that it was grand preaching, such
   as God commended. Do not, then, grudge the time, or the strength, you
   lay out in the service of our great Lord because you do not see your
   efforts thrive, for better men than you have wept over failure.

   Remember, too, that if you really do serve the Lord thoroughly and
   heartily, he will accept you and acknowledge your service, even though
   no good should come of it. It is your business to cast the bread on the
   waters: if you do not find it after many days, that is not your
   business. It is your business to scatter the seed; but no farmer says
   to his servant, John, you have not served me well, for there is no
   harvest.' The man would say, Could I make a harvest, sir? I have
   ploughed, and I have sowed. What more could I do'? Even so our good
   Lord is not austere, nor does he demand of us more than we can do. If
   you have ploughed and if you have sowed, although there should be no
   harvest, you are clear and accepted. Did it never strike you that you
   may be now employed in breaking up ground and preparing the soil from
   which other labourers who come after you will reap very plentifully.
   Perhaps your Master knows what a capital ploughman you are. He has a
   large farm, and he never means to let you become a reaper because you
   do the ploughing so well. Your Master does not intend you to take part
   in the harvest because you are such a good hand at sowing; and as he
   has crops that need sowing all the year round he keeps you at that
   work. He knows you better than you know yourself. Perchance if he were
   once to let you get on the top of a loaded wagon of your own sheaves,
   you would turn dizzy and make a fall of it; so he says, You keep to
   your ploughing and your sowing, and somebody else shall do the
   reaping.' Peradventure when your course is run you will see from
   heaven, where it will be safe for you to see it, that you did not
   labour in vain nor spend your strength for nought. One soweth and
   another reapeth.' This is the divine economy. I think that every man
   that loves his Master will say, So long as there does but come a
   harvest, I will not stipulate about who reaps it. Give me faith enough
   to be assured that the reaping will come, and I will be content.' Look
   at William Carey going to India, his prayer being India for Christ.'
   What did Carey live to see? Well, he saw good-speed enough to rejoice
   his heart: but certainly he did not see the fulfillment of all his
   prayer. Successive missionaries have since gone and spent their life on
   that vast field of enterprise. With what result? A result amply
   sufficient to justify all their toil, but, as compared with the
   millions that sit in heathendom, utterly inadequate to the craving of
   the church, much less to the crown of Christ. It does not much matter
   how any one man fares. The mighty empire will revert to the world's
   Redeemer, and I can almost trace in the records of the future the
   writing of These be the names of the mighty men whom David had,' as the
   valiant deeds of his heroes are chronicled by our Lord. When old St.
   Paul's cathedral had to be taken down in order to make room for the
   present noble edifice, some of the walls were immensely strong and
   stood like rocks. Sir Christopher Wren determined to throw them down by
   the old Roman battering-ram. The battering-ram began to work, and the
   men worked at it for hours and hours, day after day, without apparent
   effect. Blow after blow came on the wall; tremendous thuds that made
   the bystanders tremble. The wall continued to stand till they thought
   it was a useless operation. But the architect knew. He continued
   working his battering-ram till every particle of the wall felt the
   motion, and at last over it went in one tremendous ruin. Did anybody
   commend those workmen who caused the final crash, or ascribe all the
   success to them? Not a bit of it. It was the whole of them together.
   Those who had gone away to their meals, those who had begun days
   before, had as much honour in the matter as those who struck the last
   blow. And it is so in the work of Christ. We must keep on battering,
   battering, battering, and at last'though it may not be for another
   thousand years'the Lord will triumph. Though Christ cometh quickly he
   may not come for another ten thousand years, but in any case idolatry
   must die, and truth must reign. The accumulated prayers and energies of
   ages shall do the deed, and God shall be glorified. Only let us
   persevere in holy effort, and the end is sure. When a certain American
   general was fighting they said, What are you doing'? He said, I am not
   doing much, but I keep pegging away.' That is what we must do. We
   cannot do much at any one time, but we must keep on. We must keep on
   pegging away at the enemy, and something will come of it by-and-by.

   Possibly, dear friends, some of you who think you have had slender
   success may have had a great deal more than you know of. Others there
   may be whose want of success should suggest to them to try somewhere
   else, or else to try some other method. If we cannot do good in one way
   we must do it in another. Bring the matter before God in prayer. Cry
   mightily to him, for he will help you yet to do it, and his shall be
   the glory. When he has laid you low, when he has taught you how
   inefficient you are, when he has driven you in despair to rely
   implicitly upon himself, then it may be that he will give you more
   trophies and triumphs than you ever dreamed of. Anyhow, whether I
   prosper in life or not is not my question. To bring souls to Christ is
   my main endeavour, but it is not the ultimate proof of my ministry. My
   business is to live for God, to lay aside self, and give myself up
   wholly to him, and if I do that I shall be accepted whatever else may
   happen. I wish we had the spirit of that brave old man who was
   condemned to the stake. They were going to burn him. He knew that the
   sentence was to be carried out the next morning, but with a soul full
   of courage, and with a merry heart, he sat the last thing at night
   talking with his friends'faggots and fire to face in the morning,
   recollect'and he said to one of them, I am an old tree in my Master's
   orchard. When I was young I bore a little fruit by his grace. It was
   unripe and sour, but he bore with it: and I have grown mellow in my
   older days and brought forth some fruit for him by his grace. Now the
   tree has grown so old that my Master is going to cut it down and burn
   the old log. Well, it will warm the hearts of some of his family while
   I am burning'; and he even smiled for joy to think that he might be put
   to so good a purpose. I want you to have that spirit, and to say, I
   will live for Christ while I am young: I will die for him, and warm the
   hearts of my brethren. You know that the persecutions of those martyr
   days begat such heroism and gallantry among disciples as prudent people
   in peaceful times can scarcely credit. It is said of the old Baptist
   church over in the City that the members went to Smithfield early one
   morning to see their pastor burnt, and when some one asked the young
   people what they went there for, they said that they went to learn the
   way. That is splendid! They went to learn the way. Oh, go to the
   Master's cross to learn the way to live and die! See how he spent
   himself for you, and then sally forth and spend yourselves for him.
   Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall ye be glorious in the sight of
   the Lord.' Though you may think that you do not succeed, your
   whole-hearted consecration shall be your honour in the day of the Lord.
   By your hallowed life, and your humble service, you shall bring glory
   to his name. O Lord, set us in our charges, and encourage us in the
   service of thy house! Let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us;
   establish thou the work of our hands: yea, the work of our hands
   establish thou it.' May the blessing of our covenant God rest upon you,
   my brethren, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                        The Key-Note of a Choice Sonnet

   A Sermon

   (No. 1514)

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   My soul doth magnify the Lord.'Luke 1:46.

   MARY HAD RECEIVED a wonderful intimation from heaven of which she
   herself scarcely understood the full length and breadth. Her faith had
   apprehended a great promise, which as yet her mind hardly comprehended.
   Her prayer, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to
   thy word,' showed her joyful submission and childlike confidence, and
   this made her blessed with the blessedness of patient hope. Under
   divine guidance she made a speedy journey into the hill country to see
   her cousin Elisabeth, and from her she received a confirmation of the
   wonderful tidings which the angel had brought to her. Elizabeth herself
   had been favored from above, for the Lord had looked upon her, and
   taken away from her the reproach of barrenness. Amongst other choice
   words, Elizabeth said to her, Blessed is she that believed: for there
   shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the
   Lord.' When Mary had thus been comforted by her friend, and her spirit
   had been elevated, and her confidence confirmed, she began to sing unto
   the Lord most sweetly, saying, My soul doth magnify the Lord.' Now, if
   it is a good time with any of you'if in communion with some older
   believer your confidence has been strengthened, make sure that the Lord
   has a return for it. When your own heart is lifted up, then lift up the
   name of the Lord. Exalt him when he exalts you. You will perhaps tell
   me that the Virgin had very especial reason for magnifying the Lord,
   and I answer, Assuredly she had. Blessed is she among women,' and we
   are not backward to own the eminent honor which was put upon her.
   Blessed indeed she was, and highly favored. But yet, is there any true
   believer who has not also received special favor of the Lord? Sitting
   down quietly in our chamber, can we not each one say that the Lord has
   favored him or her with some special token of divine love? I think
   there is something about each believer's case which renders it special.
   We are none of us exactly like our brethren, for the manifestations of
   divine grace are very various; and there are some bright lines about
   your case, brother, which will be seen nowhere else, and some peculiar
   manifestations about your happiness, my sister, of which no one else
   can tell. I might not be straining words if I were to say to many a
   sister in Christ here, Hail, thou that art highly favored, the Lord is
   with thee: blessed art thou among women.' And I might say the same to
   many a brother here: Hail, thou that art highly favored, the Lord is
   with thee: blessed art thou among men. The Lord hath done great things
   for thee, and let thy spirit be glad.' True, there is one point in
   which we cannot be compared to Mary literally. She was to be the mother
   of the human nature of our Lord; but there is a parallel case in each
   one of us in which a higher mystery'a more spiritual mystery'gives us a
   like privilege, for, behold, the Holy Ghost dwells in each believer. He
   lives within us as within a temple, and reigns within us as in a
   palace. If we be partakers of the Holy Ghost, what more can we desire
   by way of favor from God, and what greater honor can be bestowed upon
   us? It was by her that the Word became incarnate, but so also is it by
   us, for we can make God's Word stand out visibly in our lives. It is
   ours to turn into actual, palpable existence among the sons of men the
   glorious Spirit of grace and truth which we find in the Word of God.
   Truly did our Lord speak when he said to his disciples, These are my
   mother, and sister, and brother.' We bear as close a relationship to
   Christ as did the Virgin mother, and we in some sense take the same
   position spiritually which she took up corporeally in reference to him.
   May he be formed in us the hope of glory, and may it be ours to tend
   his infant cause in the world, and watch over it as a nurse does over a
   child, and spend our life and strength in endeavoring to bring that
   infant cause to maturity, even though a sword should pass through our
   own heart while we cherish the babe.

   But now, having introduced to you her magnificat, we will dwell upon
   these words, My soul doth magnify the Lord,' and I do earnestly hope
   that many of us can adopt the language without being guilty of
   falsehood: we can as truly say as Mary did, My soul doth magnify the
   Lord.' If there are any of you present to-night who cannot say it, get
   to your chambers, fall upon your knees, and cry to the Lord to help you
   to do so; for as long as a man cannot magnify God he is not fit for
   heaven, where the praises of God are the eternal occupation of all the
   blessed spirits. If you cannot magnify God, it probably is because you
   are magnifying yourself. May the Lord cut self down and make nothing of
   you, and then you will make everything of him. When you sink in your
   own estimation, then will God rise in your esteem. May God the Holy
   Ghost make it so.

   I. Touching these words, I notice that, first, our text suggests to us
   AN OCCUPATION FOR ALL GRACIOUS PEOPLE: My soul doth magnify the Lord.'
   Here is an occupation for all of us who know the Lord, and have been
   born into his family.

   Observe, it is an occupation which may be followed by all sorts of
   people. This humble woman speaks of her low estate, and yet she could
   magnify the Lord. All believers, of every rank and condition, can
   attend to this work. There are some things that you cannot do, but this
   one thing every gracious heart can do, and should delight to do,
   namely, to magnify the Lord.

   This is an occupation which can be followed in all places. You need not
   go up to the meeting-house to magnify the Lord, you can do it at home:
   you need not step out of your own quiet little room, for you may sit
   still, and all alone you may magnify the Lord. You may be tossed about
   upon the sea in a storm, but you may trust his name, and be calm, and
   so magnify him. Or, you may be no traveler, and never go a hundred
   yards out of the village in which you were born, but you may magnify
   the Lord just as well for all that.

   Where'er we seek him he is found,

   And every place is hallowed ground';

   and in every place this hallowed occupation may be carried out, and we
   may always say'at least the place will not prevent our saying, My soul
   doth magnify the Lord.'

   This is not an occupation which requires a crowded congregation, it can
   be fitly performed in solitude. I suppose that this sonnet of the
   Virgin was sung with only one to hear it, her cousin Elisabeth. There
   is a quorum for God's praise even where there is only one; but, where
   there are two that agree to praise God, then is the praise exceeding
   sweet. Ah, my dear sisters, you will never stand up to speak to
   thousands, and many of my brethren now present would be very timid if
   they had to praise the Lord before a score. Never mind about that.
   Praise does not require even two or three, but in the quiet of the
   night, or in the loneliness of the wood far away from the haunts of
   men, your soul may pursue this blessed task, and daily, hourly,
   constantly sing' My soul doth magnify the Lord.'

   This is an occupation also, dear friends, which requires no money. Mary
   was a poor maiden. She had no gold or silver, and yet did she sweetly
   say, My soul doth magnify the Lord.' It is an honorable thing to be
   entrusted with this world's treasure to lay it out for Jesus. The
   church has its temporal needs, and happy is that man who is privileged
   to supply them: but this kind of work can be followed by the child who
   has no money, and by the workwoman who scarcely knows how to find
   herself in bread. It may be followed by the poor man reduced to the
   workhouse; and by the poor woman who lies in the infirmary breathing
   out her life. My soul doth magnify the Lord,' is as fit for paupers as
   for peers. Oh! these are golden notes, and those that use them have
   golden mouths, as golden as Chrysostom of old, even though they have to
   say, Silver and gold have I none.'

   And this is an occupation, dear friends, which I commend to all here
   present, because it does not require great talent. A simpleton may sing
   My soul doth magnify the Lord.' We have each one a soul, and when that
   soul has been renewed by grace it can follow this blessed pursuit of
   magnifying the Lord, Perhaps you have not the abilities of Mary, for
   she was, doubtless, a woman of considerable culture, like Hannah who
   preceded her, whose song she partly borrowed. Hannah seems to me to be
   one of the most gifted women of the Old Testament, and to be worthy of
   more notice than is generally given to her. But if you could not write
   a hymn, if you could not compose a verse, if you have no ability that
   way, ay, and if you cannot sing'and there are some of us that have such
   cracked voices that we never shall, and there are one or two brethren
   here who have such bad ears for time that I generally hear them a note
   behind everybody else, as I did to-night'well, never mind about that,
   our souls can magnify the Lord. It is an occupation that does not
   depend upon the voice, or upon any kind of talent whatever. Those who
   sing worst to the ear of man may, perhaps, sing best to the ear of God;
   and those who have the least apparent ability may, from the warmth of
   their heart and the ardor of their devotion, really have the greatest
   capacity in God's judgment for magnifying his name.

   My soul doth magnify the Lord.' I would invite all my brothers and
   sisters here to take this for their occupation as long as they live,
   and never to cease from it. Nay, even should death for a moment suspend
   it, let them so praise God that it shall be no new work for them to
   begin again and praise him for ever in heaven.

   Dear friends, albeit that this magnifying of the Lord is an occupation
   to be taken up by all Christians, do not let us think little of it. To
   magnify the Lord seems to me the grandest thing we mortals do, for, as
   I have already said, it is the occupation of heaven. When the saints of
   the Most High pass into their glorified state they have nothing else to
   do but to magnify the Lord. The word signifies, to put it in a Saxon
   form instead of a Latin one, to greaten God.' We cannot make him really
   greater, but we can show forth his greatness. We can make him appear
   greater. We can make others have greater thoughts of him, and that we
   do when we are praising him. We can ourselves try to have greater and
   yet greater thoughts of him'make him to our apprehension a greater God
   than we once knew him to be; and this, I say, is no mean occupation,
   because it is followed in heaven by all redeemed and perfected spirits.
   Even here, it is the end of everything. Praying is the end of
   preaching, for preaching and hearing are nothing in themselves except
   men be brought to Christ and led to prayer. But then praying is not the
   end: praising is the end of praying. Prayer is the stalk of the wheat,
   but praise is the ear of the wheat: it is the harvest itself. When God
   is praised, we have come to the ultimatum. This is the thing for which
   all other things are designed. We are to be saved for this end, To the
   praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in
   the Beloved.' We are not saved for our own sakes. How often does the
   Scripture tell us this in sense, and sometimes in words, Not for your
   sakes do I this, saith the Lord God, be it known unto you; be ashamed
   and be confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel.' The glory of
   God is to my mind the highest conceivable end'it certainly is the chief
   end of my being. So, my dear brother, if you cannot go out to preach'if
   after looking over all your condition you feel that your sickness and
   other circumstances may excuse you from active service, and even if you
   are compelled to keep your bed, do not suppose that you are useless as
   to the highest end of your being. You may still serve it by lying upon
   the couch of pain and magnifying the Lord by patience. Have you ever
   looked at those lovely lilies which adorn our gardens with their golden
   petals and their milk-white leaves? How they praise God! And yet they
   never sing. You do not even hear a rustle, but they stand still and
   praise God by existing'by just, as it were, enjoying the sun and the
   dew, and showing what God can do. A genuine Christian shut up under
   pain and sickness may glorify God by being his beloved child, by
   receiving the love of God, by showing in his common-place daily
   character, which is only noticeable from its holiness, what the grace
   of God can do. Oh may this be the occupation of us all since it is so
   noble a pursuit! My soul doth magnify the Lord.' Come, what are you
   doing to-night? Have you been during this day murmuring and complaining
   and grumbling? End that, and begin praising. Some of you are farmers,
   and I have no doubt you have grumbled because of the weather. I do not
   wonder, but I hope that you will not do it any more, but rather believe
   that God knows better about skies and clods and clouds and crops than
   you do. If we had the management of the weather, I have no doubt we
   think we should do it very splendidly, but I question whether we should
   not ruin all creation. Our great Lord and Master knows how to manage
   everything. Let us cease from all criticism of what he does, and say,
   My soul does not grumble. My soul does not complain; I have taken up a
   better business than that. My soul doth magnify the Lord.' That is her
   one engagement from which she will never cease.'

   II. Secondly, if you look at the text from another point of view, it
   provides for us A REMEDY FOR SELF-CONGRATULATION.

   If any one of us had been favored, as the Virgin was, with the promise
   that we should become the parent of the Savior, do you not think that
   we should have felt exceedingly lifted up? It was natural that she
   should be proud, but it was gracious on her part that she was humble.
   Instead of magnifying herself she magnified the Lord. It was a great
   thing, and somebody must be magnified for it. Nature would have said,
   Mary, magnify thyself'; but grace said, Mary, magnify the Lord.' If the
   Lord has been very gracious to any one of us, our only way to escape
   from vain-glorious pride, which will be exceedingly wicked if we
   indulge in it, is by giving vent to our feelings in quite another
   direction. Do you notice how she sets off the greatness of God by her
   own insignificance? He that is mighty hath done to me great things.' To
   me,' she says. They are great things, and he is mighty, but they are to
   me. He hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden.' Over against
   the greatness of God's goodness to you be sure to set in contrast your
   own meanness and unworthiness. Has the Lord redeemed you, called you,
   justified you, sanctified you, set you in his church, and given you a
   name and a place among his people? When you are inclined to run up the
   topgallants, and to hang out all the flags, and to glory in your flesh,
   recollect who you are and what you are, and the hole of the pit whence
   you were drawn, and the rock out of which you were hewn, and say, Why
   me, Lord? Why me?' Begin to magnify the name of the Lord, and that will
   be a death-blow to the temptation to pride.

   Mary had a specialty: no one else should be the mother of our Lord: but
   so have we. Electing love has pitched on us. Many have been passed by,
   but the Lord has loved us with a special love; yet we cannot rejoice in
   it so as to glory in ourselves, for this election is according to his
   sovereign will, and not of ourselves. It is all of grace and free
   favor, and not according to merit. Hence my soul doth magnify the Lord
   for everlasting love and special redemption. Whence is this to me? What
   am I, and what is my father's house, that thou, O Lord, shouldst choose
   me?

   Mary knew also that she was to be famous. All generations shall call me
   blessed.' But do notice how she balances her fame with another fame.
   She says, Holy is his name, and his mercy is on them that fear him.'
   She magnifies the name of the Lord. If he has given her a measure of
   honor, she lays it at his feet. Mind you do the same. Be not so vain as
   to be lifted up with a little success. We have all passed through this
   test of character, and in the fining-pot how few of us have borne the
   fire without loss! Perhaps you have preached a sermon and God has
   blessed it; the congregation is increased, and crowds are gathering;
   the probability is that the devil whispers, You are a capital preacher.
   Well done! You put your point admirably: God is blessing you. There
   must be something admirable in your character and abilities.' Away,
   away, thou fiend of the pit! This is ruinous pride! But suppose, dear
   brother, that the fiend will not go away while he finds you musing upon
   your success, what are you to do? Try him with this'My soul doth
   magnify the Lord.' Praise the name of the Lord that ever he should make
   use of such a poor, unsuitable instrument as yourself. Give him all the
   honor and all the glory, if honor and glory there be, and see if the
   arch-enemy does not take to flight, for God's praises are abhorrent to
   the devil.

   In whatever capacity you are serving the Lord, if he puts any honor
   upon you, mind you give it all back to him. Sedulously and carefully
   endeavor to do this, for robbery here will be fatal; he will not give
   his glory to another. If we begin to pilfer even a little of the
   praise, we shall find that our Master will reckon us to be unfaithful
   stewards, and give us a discharge. If we glory in our strength, we may
   have to go out and shake ourselves like Samson when his hair was lost,
   because the Lord has taken our strength away from us. A heart that is
   lifted up with self-esteem will soon be cast down in the mire. Mary
   knew that God's favors are given to us, not that we may congratulate
   ourselves, but that we may worship him; and she acted accordingly. If
   grace be come to thee, my brother, it is a wanton waste of it to pride
   thyself upon it. Like the manna in the Israelite's house when kept till
   the morning, it will breed worms and stink: no worm ever brought
   swifter decay than pride. Bear the shield of thine honor as an
   armor-bearer for thy Lord, Know that thou hast nothing but what belongs
   to him. Use all for him, and glorify him for all, and in all; and so
   wilt thou do well. I recommend the text, then, as a cure for pride: My
   soul doth magnify the Lord.'

   III. Thirdly, and I will be brief on each point, the text is A FRUITFUL
   UTTERANCE FOR HOLY FEELINGS. My soul doth magnify the Lord,' is
   evidently the overflow of a full soul.

   There must have been great mixture of feeling in the heart of this holy
   woman; but these few words furnished expression for every variety of
   her emotions. Those feelings were of an opposite character, and yet
   they all spoke by this one sentence. It is clear that she was filled
   with wonder. Her thoughtful spirit asked, how can so great a thing be
   true to me? Shall the Son of the Highest be born of Mary, the village
   maiden? Oh, miracle of condescension! With the amazement there was
   mingled, not the unbelief which too often comes of wonder, but an
   expectation of the promised marvel. She believed that the things which
   were spoken to her would be performed by the Lord, and she looked that
   God should keep his word to her. How sweetly those two feelings, wonder
   and expectation, are blended, hidden away and yet expressed, in these
   few words, My soul doth magnify the Lord'! It is as though she had
   said, I cannot understand the favor promised me. How glorious in his
   grace is the Lord my God! But I expect the blessing: I am sure of it,
   for the Lord is true! So I praise him concerning it.' The sentence is
   tinged with two fair colors, the vermilion of wonder and the azure of
   hope, and they meet harmoniously upon the same ground. The words are
   wonderful on that account.

   Now take two other mental states. The first would be her believing. She
   was not like Zacharias, who needed to be struck dumb because he doubted
   the word of the Lord. Mary had faith, and yet, at the same time she
   must have been awe-stricken by the revelation. That she should give
   birth to the Son of the Highest must have utterly abashed and
   overwhelmed her. Now both these states of mind are here'faith and awe.
   Faith says, I know that the angel's message is true, and therefore my
   soul doth magnify the Lord.' Awe says, What a solemn thing it is that
   God should come to dwell in my breast! My soul doth magnify the Lord.'
   Thus in these words confidence and reverence have met together,
   assurance and adoration have kissed each other. Here is faith with its
   familiarity, and devotion with its godly fear.

   Here, also, you very clearly perceive two other holy emotions. Her
   humility is apparent, and in the text it seems to ask the question, How
   can this happen to me? How can it be that such a poor woman, affianced
   to a humble carpenter, should be the mother of my Lord?' Humility sheds
   its perfume here, like a violet hidden away. She seems to say, Not unto
   me, not unto me be the glory! My soul doth magnify the Lord.' But that
   humility is not of the cringing and crouching kind which draws back
   from God, for it is clearly mixed with love. I rejoice in my gracious
   Lord,' she seems to say, I bless him: I love him: I praise him. My soul
   doth magnify the Lord. I am not worthy of his promised visitation, but
   it will be mine, and infinite condescension will do this thing unto me.
   Therefore do I love my God, and I draw near to him. My soul doth
   magnify the Lord.'

   Brothers and sisters, you will often find the language of my text the
   most expressive of utterances for all that is good in your minds. Many
   sweet passions, like little birds, may fold their wings, and dwell
   together in this one well-compacted nest,'My soul doth magnify the
   Lord,' Holy emotions may fly hither in swarms, and make the text like a
   hive of bees, stored with honey. As I turn and think it over, it sheds
   abroad its own spirit within me, as spices breathe out their own
   perfume, and I cry, My soul doth magnify him.'

   I think I perceive in these words a singular mixture of admiration and
   calm thought: a wonder in which there is no surprise. The blessed
   Virgin is evidently, as I have said before, wonder-struck that such a
   thing should come to her, and yet there is about that wonder no
   startling of amazement, but a marvelling which is the result of
   previous careful thought. She had considered the prophecies and
   promises, and saw them about to be fulfilled in her seed. She sang in
   the fifty-fourth and fifty-fifth verses, He hath holpen his servant
   Israel, in remembrance of his mercy; as he spake to our fathers, to
   Abraham, and to his seed for ever.' She had turned over the subject in
   her mind, and she came to the conclusion, He has said he will do this.
   It is as he spake.' So, oftentimes, when you get a mercy given to you,
   you will be surprised at it at first, but afterwards you will say, This
   is even as the Lord promised to me. He doeth no new thing to his
   servant. It is only my forgetfulness that has made me to be astonished.
   Did he not promise that he would help me'that he would deliver me'that
   he would give me all that I needed? And inasmuch as he has done it in
   this surprising way, my soul doth magnify him twice over for the
   wonderful mercy, and for the faithfulness of his covenant love which
   kept the ancient promise which he made to be yea and amen in Christ
   Jesus.' Again, I say, I commend the text as an expression of your
   feelings. How sweet are the words, My soul doth magnify the Lord'! They
   are full, many-sided, and natural, and yet most spiritual.

   IV. Fourthly, I think my text may be used as A REASON FOR HOPEFULNESS.

   It would be well to be wrapped up in this spirit with regard to
   everything. The mood which bids us sing My soul doth magnify the Lord'
   is full of a hope which will be useful in a thousand ways. For
   instance, concerning our own providential condition, let us magnify the
   Lord. Surrounded with difficulties, let us walk on with confidence,
   because our great God is equal to every emergency, and can both level
   the mountains and fill up the valleys. Burdened with labors and
   stripped by necessities, let us maintain an unchanging cheerfulness,
   because we magnify the might and the bounty of the eternal Jehovah,
   whose name is God All-sufficient. When danger is magnified by fear, let
   God be magnified by faith. When the troubles of our heart are enlarged,
   let our expectations from the Lord be enlarged also.

   The same God-magnifying spirit should attend our glances into futurity,
   if we indulge in any, and we are all too apt to do so. Ah! we would
   like to know, some of us, what is going to happen to us. Fain would we
   steal a glance behind the screen, and each one see

   What gloomy lines are writ for me,

   Or what dark scenes arise'

   There is a desire in most persons' minds to draw away the curtain which
   God has so wisely placed over the future. This is very wrong of us, and
   yet it is as common as it is blamable. We all turn prophets every now
   and then, and when we do we prophesy evil, and therefore it would be
   well if we could catch the spirit of Mary with regard to our forecasts
   of the future, and say, My soul doth magnify the Lord.' Why do we set
   our blear-eyed anxieties to watch the signs of heaven? If we must pry,
   and guess, and speculate, why not employ our brighter powers, and let
   blue-eyed hope scan the ensigns of the sky? When we meddle with the
   future how dare we foretell that which would dishonor the Lord? If we
   must needs write bitter things against ourselves, yet we ought not to
   write untruthful things against him. When we do forecast the future at
   all, let us do it in the spirit wherewith we sing, My soul doth magnify
   the Lord.' Let us be certain that we shall find him to be a great God
   in the future, greatly good, wondrously gracious, magnifying his mercy.
   We shall have troubles, but our soul doth magnify the Lord, for she
   foresees that we shall ride out all storms with Jesus at the helm, and
   come safe into port. Our anxious eye foresees necessities, but our soul
   doth magnify the Lord, for she sees him with a golden key opening the
   treasures of David, and supplying all her wants. Our troubled car can
   hear the wolf, but our soul doth magnify the Lord, for she sings, The
   Lord is my Shepherd, and he will preserve me.' In this spirit you may
   look forward to the swellings of Jordan, magnifying the living God
   while you yourself lie down to die. If you faint and begin to say, Ah!
   I shall never be able to die triumphantly,' you are minimizing, and not
   magnifying, the Lord. You are making him little, and not great. Try and
   say, How marvellously will he show his grace to me, a dying worm! Oh,
   how wondrous he will be in the eyes of angels that will crowd the banks
   to' hear a poor trembling soul like me go singing through the stream!
   My God will be great in that day; then will he lay bare his arm, and
   therefore will I fear no evil, for he will be with me; his rod and his
   staff will comfort me.' Think great things of God. Greaten God. Magnify
   his name whenever you look forward to the future. Chase from your mind
   any imagination or foreboding which would detract from the greatness or
   the goodness of your God.

   Judge in the same manner with regard to the salvation of your
   fellow-men. Never say, It is of no use inducing such a man to attend
   the means of grace. He is a blaspheming wretch. All that he would do if
   he heard a sermon would be to make sport of it for the next week. I
   have no faith in taking such a man to hear a ministry which he would be
   sure to ridicule.' Such unbelieving talk is making little of God. Is it
   not so? Is it not dishonoring God to think that his gospel cannot reach
   the most depraved hearts? Why, if I knew that a man had seven thousand
   devils in him, I believe the gospel could drive them all out. Get the
   sinners under the sound of the word, and the worse they are,
   oftentimes, the more does God love to display the greatness of his
   grace in casting down the power of their sin. Believe great things of
   God. I can honestly say this'that since God saved me I never doubted
   his power to save anybody. All things are possible now that he has
   brought me to his feet, and kept me these years as his loving child. I
   must think great things of God who has done such great things for so
   great a sinner as I am. Greaten God, my brethren; greaten God. Believe
   great things of him. Believe that China can be made into a province of
   the celestial kingdom. Believe that India will cast her riches at
   Jesus' feet. Believe that the round world will yet be a pearl on
   Christ's finger-ring. Do not go in for the dispiriting, despairing,
   unmanly, un-Christly ideas of those who say, The world is not to be
   converted. It is a poor wreck that will go to pieces, and we are to
   fish off here and there one from the water-logged hulk.' Brethren,
   never believe that we are to stand by and see the eternal defeat of
   God. Deem not that our God is unable to win upon the old lines, and
   must needs shift the plan of the campaign. It shall never be said that
   God could not save the world by the preaching of the gospel, and by the
   work of the Holy Spirit, and therefore must needs bring in the advent
   of the Lord to do it. I believe in the coming of the Lord, but, blessed
   be his name, I believe also that the battle which he has begun in the
   Spirit he will fight out in the old style, and finish with a victory in
   the very manner in which he opened the conflict. It pleases him by the
   foolishness of preaching to save them that believe, and it will please
   him to continue to do so till the whole round earth shall ring with
   hallelujahs of praise to the grace of God, who by the feeblest of his
   creatures shall have defeated sin, and death, and hell. Do not get into
   a desponding state of mind, and rush into half-insane theories of
   prophecy in order to excuse your unbelief and idleness. Never throw
   down your weapons, and pretend that the victory is to be won by doting
   and dreaming: we are to fight to the end with the same weapons, and in
   the same name. We will drive the devil out of the world yet, by the
   grace of God, by the old, efficient weapons of the Word of God and the
   Spirit of God. Greaten God, and magnify his name, by believing in the
   success of the gospel of his dear Son.

   As to the nearer future, never believe any human prophecy that does not
   glorify God. Expect great things of God, and if you hear any prediction
   that is not to the glory of God, conclude that it is a blunder. Oh!'
   said one to me, this country will go back to Romanism: the gospel light
   will be quenched in England.' Ah, dear me! Some brethren are mightily
   fond of this prognostication. But, my dear friend, there is one thing
   that always comforts me, namely, that God is not dead: and he is not
   going to be defeated by the pope of Rome, or fifty popes of Rome. He
   will win the victory yet. Always have courage, for it is God's cause,
   and it is in God's hands, and, being in God's hands, it is safe enough.
   See what you do:'because you cannot trust God's hand you trust your
   own! You thrust out your sacrilegious arm to interfere with God's
   peculiar work. What are you at? You are about to defile God's ark.
   Recollect the story of Uzzah. Pluck your hand back, and leave the ark
   alone. The Lord will help you to do such work as he gives you to do,
   but he has not made you Lord of empires, nor director of providence.
   Leave to his sovereign sway the purposes of his eternal grace, and
   depend upon it he will bring the world to Jesus' feet. Christ himself
   shall come: be you looking for him every day, but be constant in his
   service, working for him every hour. Believe, too, that he shall reign
   amongst his ancients gloriously, and where amidst Judea's glades Christ
   has been dishonored and the false prophet has ruled, there too shall he
   reign, and Jew and Gentile shall worship and adore his ever-blessed
   name. I say again, magnify the Lord with all your souls. Greaten God.
   Expect great things in the future, and with the cheery note of
   confidence go forward to battle for him whose is the victory for ever
   and ever.

   V. Once more, and I have done. Our text should be used as a GUIDE IN
   OUR THEOLOGY. We will finish with that. Here is a very useful test for
   young disciples who are beginning to study God's word. My soul doth
   magnify the Lord.' If you will carry this with you it will often save
   you from error, and guide you into truth. There is certain teaching
   which makes a great deal of man: it talks much of man's free-will,
   ability, capacity, and natural dignity. It evidently makes man the
   center and end of all things, and God is placed in a position of
   service to his creature. As for the Fall: father Adam slipped and broke
   his little finger, or something of the kind, but this theology sees no
   great ruin as the result of the fall. As for salvation: it is a slight
   cure for a small ill, and by no means the infinite grace which we
   consider it to be. Dear brethren, let those have this theology who like
   it, but do not you touch it even with a pair of tongs. It is of no use
   to man, for it mistakes his position, and only ministers to his pride.
   Man's place is not on the throne, but at the foot of the cross. Listen
   to another theology, in which the sinner is laid low, his sinfulness is
   exposed, his corruption is unfolded, Christ's redemption is magnified,
   free grace is extolled, and the Holy Ghost is adored. That is the
   theology for you, believe it: that is the theology of the Scriptures,
   accept it. I do not think that you will often be led wrong if this be
   your mode of judgment: that which glorifies God is true, and that which
   does not glorify God is false.

   Sometimes you will meet with an undoubted teaching of God's word which
   you do not understand. You know that the doctrine is taught in the
   word, but you cannot make it coincide with some other truth, and you
   cannot quite see, perhaps, how it glorifies God. Then, dear brother,
   dear sister, glorify God by believing it. To believe a doctrine which
   you see to be true by mere reason is nothing very wonderful. There is
   no very great glory to God in believing what is as clear as the sun in
   the heavens; but to believe a truth when it staggers you'oh, gracious
   faith! oh, blessed faith! You will perhaps remember an illustration
   taken from Mr. Gough, where the little boy says, If mother says it is
   so, it is so if it is not so.' That is the kind of believing for a
   child towards its mother, and that is the sort of believing we ought to
   exercise towards God. I do not see the fact, and I cannot quite
   apprehend it, but God says it is so, and I believe him. If all the
   philosophers in the world should contradict the Scriptures, so much the
   worse for the philosophers; their contradiction makes no difference to
   our faith. Half a grain of God's word weighs more with us than a
   thousand tons of words or thoughts of all the modern theologians,
   philosophers, and scientists that exist on the face of the earth; for
   God knows more about his own works than they do. They do but think, but
   the Lord knows. With regard to truths which philosophers ought not to
   meddle with, because they have not specially turned their thoughts that
   way, they are not more qualified to judge than the poorest man in the
   church of God, nay, nor one-half so much. Inasmuch as the most learned
   unregenerate men are dead in sin, what do they know about the living
   things of the children of Cod? Instead of setting them to judge we will
   sooner trust our boys and girls that are just converted, for they do
   know something of divine things, but carnal philosophers know nothing
   of them. Do not be staggered, brothers and sisters, but honor God,
   glorify God, and magnify him by believing great things and
   unsearchable'past your finding out'which you know to be true because he
   declares them to be so. Let the ipse dixit of God stand to you in the
   place of all reason, being indeed the highest and purest reason, for
   God, the Infallible, speaks what must be true.

   So, then, I come back to where I started. Let us go forth and
   practically try to magnify the name of the Lord. Go home and speak well
   of his name: gather your children together and tell them what a good
   and great God he has been. Some of you who have a swarm of youngsters
   could not do better than spend half an hour in telling them of his
   goodness to you in all your times of trouble. Leave to your children
   the heirloom of gratitude. Tell them how good the Lord was to their
   father, and how good he will be to his children: tell your servants,
   tell your work-people, tell anybody with whom you come in contact what
   a blessed God the Lord is. For my part, I never can speak well enough
   of his adorable name. He is the best of masters, his service is
   delight; he is the best of fathers, his commands are pleasure. Was
   there ever such a god as our God, our enemies themselves being judges?

   Magnify his name by the brightness of your countenances. Rejoice and be
   glad in him. When you are in sorrow and must needs fast, yet appear not
   unto men to fast, but anoint your faces and still wear a smile. Let not
   the world think that the servants of a king go mourning all their days.
   Make the world feel what a great God you serve, and what a blessed
   Savior Christ is, and thus evermore let your soul magnify the Lord. God
   grant you grace to do so, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

  LETTER FROM MR. SPURGEON.

   Dear Friends,'Your continued prayers are sought for the special
   services at the tabernacle, that by their success any injury occurring
   through the pastor's enforced absence may be remedied. It would be an
   affliction indeed if our life-work should suffer through painful
   sickness, which in itself is a heavy cross to bear. By your prayers
   this will be averted, and the trial will be turned into a blessing.

   Right thankful am I to report rapid, and I trust real, progress in my
   own case. Living in an unbroken series of summer days, where no cold
   mists are dreamed of, it is no great marvel that rheumatic pains fly
   away, and depression of spirit departs. The healing Lord has breathed a
   restoring influence over land, and sea, and sky, and I am feeling it to
   my great joy. Hoping soon to be among my own people, and to issue
   sermons newly preached, I am, to my many hearty friends, their grateful
   servant.

A Woman of a Sorrowful Spirit

   (No. 1515)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful
   spirit." 1 Samuel 1:15.

   The special cause of Hannah's sorrow arose from the institution of
   polygamy, which, although it was tolerated under the old Law, is always
   exhibited to us in practical action as a most fruitful source of sorrow
   and sin. In no one recorded instance in Holy Scripture is it set forth
   as admirable. In most cases the proofs of its evil effects lie open to
   the sun. We ought to be grateful that under the Christian religion that
   abomination has been wiped away, for even with such husbands as
   Abraham, Jacob, David and Solomon, it did not work towards happiness or
   righteousness. The husband found the system a heavy burden, grievous to
   be borne, for he soon found out the truth of the wise man's advice to
   the Sultan, "First learn to live with two tigresses and then expect to
   live happily with two wives."

   The wife must, in nearly every case, have felt the wretchedness of
   sharing a love which ought to be all her own. What miseries Eastern
   women have suffered in the harem, none can tell, or perhaps imagine. In
   the case before us, Elkanah had trouble, enough, through wearing the
   double chain, but still the heaviest burden fell upon his beloved
   Hannah, the better of his two wives. The worse the woman, the better
   she could get on with the system of many wives, but the good woman, the
   true woman, was sure to smart under it.

   Though dearly loved by her husband, the jealousy of the rival wife
   embittered Hannah's life and made her "a woman of a sorrowful spirit."
   We thank God that no longer is the altar of God covered with tears,
   with weeping and with crying out of those wives of youth who find their
   husbands' hearts estranged and divided by other wives. Because of the
   hardness of their hearts, the evil was tolerated for a while, but the
   many evils which sprang of it should suffice to put a ban upon it among
   all who seek the welfare of our race.

   In the beginning the Lord made for man but one wife. And why only one?
   For He had the residue of the Spirit and could have breathed into as
   many as He pleased. Malachi answers, "That He might seek a godly Seed."
   As if it was quite clear that the children of polygamy would be ungodly
   and only in the house of one man and one wife would godliness be found.
   This witness is of the Lord and is true. But enough sources of grief
   remain--more than enough--and there is not in any household, I suppose,
   however joyous, the utter absence of the cross. The worldling says,
   "There is a skeleton in every house." I know little about such dead
   things, but I know that a cross of some sort or other must be borne by
   every child of God.

   All the true-born heirs of Heaven must pass under the rod of the
   Covenant. What son is there whom the Father chastens not? The smoking
   furnace is part of the insignia of the heavenly family, without which a
   man may well question whether he stands in Covenant relationship to God
   at all. Probably some Hannah is now before me, smarting under the
   chastening hand of God; some child of Light walking in darkness; some
   daughter of Abraham bowed down by Satan and it may not be amiss to
   remind her that she is not the first of her kind, but that in years
   gone by there stood at the door of God's house one like she is, who
   said of herself, "No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit." May
   the ever-blessed Comforter, whose work lies mainly with the sorrowful,
   fill our meditation with consolation at this time.

   In speaking of this, "woman of a sorrowful spirit," we shall make this
   first remark--much that is precious may be connected with a sorrowful
   spirit but, in itself, a sorrowful spirit is not to be desired. Give us
   the bright eye, the cheerful smile, the vivacious manner, the genial
   tone. If we do not desire mirth and merriment, yet give us, at least,
   that calm peace, that quiet composure, that restful happiness which
   makes home happy wherever it pervades the atmosphere. There are wives,
   mothers and daughters who should exhibit more of these cheerful graces
   than they now do and they are very blamable for being petulant, unkind
   and irritable.

   But there are others, I doubt not, who labor to their utmost to be all
   that is delightful and yet fail in the attempt, because, like Hannah,
   they are of a sorrowful spirit and cannot shake off the grief which
   burdens their heart. Now, it is

   idle to tell the night that it should be brilliant as the day, or bid
   the winter put on the flowers of summer! And equally vain is it to
   chide the broken heart. The bird of night cannot sing at Heaven's gate,
   nor can the crushed worm leap like a hart up on the mountains. It is of
   little use exhorting the willow whose branches weep by the river to
   lift up its head like the palm, or spread its branches like the
   cedar--everything must act according to its kind--each nature has its
   own appropriate ways, nor can it escape the bonds of its fashioning.
   There are circumstances of constitution, education and surroundings
   which render it difficult for some very excellent persons to be
   cheerful--they are predestined to be known by such a name as this--"A
   woman of a sorrowful spirit."

   Note well the precious things which went in Hannah's case with a
   sorrowful spirit. The first was true godliness. She was a godly woman.
   As we read the chapter, we are thoroughly convinced that her heart was
   right with God. We cannot raise any question about the sincerity of her
   prayer, or the prevalence of it. We do not doubt, for a moment, the
   truthfulness of her consecration. She was one that feared God above
   many, an eminently gracious woman and yet, "a woman of a sorrowful
   spirit." Never draw the inference from sorrow that the subject of it is
   not beloved of God. You might more safely reason in the opposite way,
   though it would not be always safe to do so, for outward circumstances
   are poor tests of a man's spiritual state.

   Certainly Dives, in his scarlet and fine linen, was not beloved of God,
   while Lazarus, with the dogs licking his sores, was a favorite of
   Heaven. And yet it is not every rich man that is cast away, or every
   beggar that will be borne aloft by angels. Outward condition can lead
   us to no determination one way or the other. Hearts must be judged,
   conduct and action must be weighed and a verdict given otherwise than
   by the outward appearance. Many persons feel very happy, but they must
   not, therefore, infer that God loves them! And while certain others are
   sadly depressed, it would be most cruel to suggest to them that God is
   angry with them. It is never said, "whom the Lord loves He enriches,"
   but it is said, "whom the Lord loves He chastens."

   Affliction and suffering are not proofs of sonship, for "many sorrows
   shall be to the wicked" and yet, where there are great tribulations, it
   often happens that there are great manifestations of the Divine favor.
   There is a sorrow of the world that works death--a sorrow which springs
   from self-will and is nurtured in rebellion and is, therefore, an evil
   thing because it is opposed to the Divine will. There is a sorrow which
   eats as does a canker and breeds yet greater sorrows, so that such
   mourners descend with their sorrowful spirits down to the place where
   sorrow reigns supreme and hope shall never come. Think of this, but
   never doubt the fact that a sorrowful spirit is in perfect consistency
   with the love of God and the possession of true godliness.

   It is freely admitted that godliness ought to cheer many a sorrowful
   spirit more than it does. It is also admitted that much of the
   experience of Christians is not Christian experience, but a mournful
   departure from what true Believers ought to be and feel. There is very
   much of Christians' experience which they never ought to experience.
   Half the troubles of life are homemade and utterly unnecessary. We
   afflict ourselves, perhaps, 10 times more than God afflicts us! We add
   many thongs to God's whip--when there would be but one--we must make
   nine! God sends one cloud by His Providence and we raise a score by our
   unbelief!

   But taking all that off and making the still further abatement that the
   Gospel commands us to rejoice in the Lord always and that it would
   never bid us do so if there were not abundant causes and arguments for
   it, yet, for all that, a sorrowful spirit may be possessed by one who
   most truly and deeply fears the Lord. Never judge those whom you see
   sad and write them down as under Divine anger, for you might err most
   grievously and most cruelly in making so rash a judgment! Fools despise
   the afflicted, but wise men prize them! Many of the sweetest flowers in
   the garden of Grace grow in the shade and flourish in the damp.

   I am persuaded that He "who feeds among the lilies" has rare plants in
   His garden, fair and fragrant, choice and comely, which are more at
   home in the damps of mourning than in the glaring sun of joy. I have
   known such who have been a living lesson to us all from their
   broken-hearted penitence, their solemn earnestness, their jealous
   watchfulness, their sweet humility and their gentle love. These are
   lilies of the valley bearing a wealth of beauty, pleasant even to the
   King Himself! Feeble as to assurance and to be pitied for their
   timidity, yet have they been lovely in their despondencies and graceful
   in their holy anxieties.

   Hannah, then, possessed godliness despite her sorrow. In connection
   with this sorrowful spirit of hers Hannah was a lovable woman. Her
   husband greatly delighted in her. That she had no children was to him
   no depreciation of her value.

   He said, "Am I not better to you than 10 sons?" He evidently felt that
   he would do anything in his power to lift up the gloom from her spirit.
   This fact is worth noting, for it does so happen that many sorrowful
   people are far from being lovable people. In too many instances their
   griefs have soured them. Their affliction has generated acid in their
   hearts and with that acid they bite into everything they touch--their
   temper has more of the oil of vitriol in it than of the oil of
   brotherly love. Nobody ever had any trouble except themselves! They
   declare no rival in the realm of suffering, but persecute their fellow
   sufferers with a kind of jealousy, as if they, alone, were the brides
   of suffering and others were mere intruders.

   They think every other person's sorrow is a mere fancy or make-believe
   compared with theirs. They sit alone and keep silent. When they speak,
   their silence would have been preferable. It is a pity it should be so
   and yet so it is that men and women of a sorrowful spirit are
   frequently to be met with those who are unloving and unlovable. The
   more heartily, therefore, do I admire in true Christian people the
   Grace which sweetens them so that the more they suffer, the more gentle
   and patient they become with other sufferers and the more ready to bear
   whatever trouble may be involved in the necessities of compassion.
   Beloved, if you are much tried and troubled and if you are much
   depressed in spirit, entreat the Lord to prevent your becoming a
   killjoy to others. Remember your Master's rule, "And you, when you
   fast, anoint your head and wash your face, that you appear not unto men
   to fast."

   I say not that our Lord spoke the word with the exact meaning I am now
   giving to it, but it is a kindred sense. Be cheerful even when your
   heart is sad. It is not necessary that every heart should be heavy
   because I am burdened--of what use would that be to me or to anyone
   else? No, let us try to be cheerful that we may be lovable, even if we
   still remain of a sorrowful spirit. Self and our own personal woes must
   not be our life psalm, nor our daily discourse. Others must be thought
   of and in their joys we must try to sympathize. In Hannah's case, too,
   the woman of a sorrowful spirit was a very gentle woman. Peninnah, with
   her harsh, haughty and arrogant speech, sorely vexed her to make her
   fret, but we do not find that she answered her.

   At the annual festival, when Peninnah had provoked her the most, she
   stole away to the sanctuary to weep alone, for she was very tender and
   submissive. When Eli said, "How long will you be drunken? Put away your
   wine from you," she did not answer him tartly, as she might well have
   done. Her answer to the aged priest is a model of submissiveness. Her
   answer to the aged priest is a model of gentleness. She most
   effectually cleared herself and plainly refuted the harsh imputation,
   but she made no retort and murmured no charge of injustice. She did not
   tell him that he was ungenerous in having thought so harshly, nor was
   there anger in her grief. She excused his mistake. He was an old man.
   It was his duty to see that worship was fitly conducted and, if he
   judged her to be in a wrong state, it was but faithfulness on his part
   to make the remark. And she took it, therefore, in the spirit in which
   she thought he offered it. At any rate, she bore the rebuke without
   resentment or repining.

   Now, some sad people are very tart, very sharp, very severe and, if you
   misjudge them at all, they inveigh against your cruelty with the utmost
   bitterness. You are the unkindest of men if you think them less than
   perfect! With what an air and tone of injured innocence will they
   vindicate themselves! You have committed worse than blasphemy if you
   have ventured to hint a fault. I am not about to blame them, for we
   might be as ungentle as they if we were to be too severe in our
   criticism on the sharpness which springs of sorrow. But it is very
   beautiful when the afflicted are full of sweetness and light and, like
   the sycamore figs, are ripened by their bruising. When their own
   bleeding wound makes them tender of wounding others and their own hurt
   makes them more ready to bear what hurt may come through the mistakes
   of others, then have we a lovely proof that "sweet are the uses of
   adversity."

   Look at your Lord. Oh that we all would look at Him, who, when He was
   reviled, reviled not again and who, when they mocked Him, had not a
   word of upbraiding, but answered by His prayers, saying, "Father,
   forgive them, for they know not what they do." Don't you see much that
   is precious may go with a sorrowful spirit? There was more, however,
   than I have shown you, for Hannah was a thoughtful woman. Her sorrow
   drove her, first, within herself and next into much communion with her
   God. That she was a highly thoughtful woman appears in everything she
   says. She does not pour out that which first comes to hand. The product
   of her mind is evidently that which only a cultivated soil could yield.

   I will not, just now, speak of her son further than to say that for
   loftiness of majesty and fullness of true poetry it is equal to
   anything from the pen of that sweet Psalmist of Israel, David himself.
   The Virgin Mary evidently followed in the

   wake of this great poetess, this mistress of the lyric are. Remember,
   also, that though she was a woman of a sorrowful spirit, she was a
   blessed woman. I might fitly say of her, "Hail, you that are highly
   favored! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women." The
   daughters of Belial could laugh and make merry and regard her as the
   dust beneath their feet, but yet she had, with her sorrowful spirit,
   found Grace in the sight of the Lord! There was Peninnah, with her
   quiver full of children, exulting over the barren mourner, yet Peninnah
   was not blessed, while Hannah, with all her griefs, was dear unto the
   Lord.

   She seems to be somewhat like he of another age, of whom we read that
   Jabez was more honorable than his brethren because his mother bore him
   with sorrow. Sorrow brings a wealth of blessing with it when the Lord
   consecrates it. And if one had to take his position with the merry or
   with the mournful, he would do well to take counsel of Solomon, who
   said, "It is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of
   feasting." A present flash is seen in the mirth of the world, but there
   is vastly more true light to be found in the griefs of Christians. When
   you see how the Lord sustains and sanctifies His people by their
   afflictions, the darkness glows into noonday!

   We come now to a second remark which is that much that is precious may
   come out of a sorrowful spirit--it is not only to be found with it--but
   may even grow out of it. Observe, first, that through her sorrowful
   spirit Hannah had learned to pray. I will not say but what she prayed
   before this great sorrow struck her, but this I know, she prayed with
   more intensity than before when she heard her rival talk so exceeding
   proudly and saw herself to be utterly despised. Oh, Brothers and
   Sisters, if you have a secret grief, learn where to carry it and delay
   not to take it there! Learn from Hannah! Her appeal was to the Lord.
   She poured not out the secret of her soul into mortal ears, but spread
   her grief before God in His own house and in His own appointed manner!

   She was in bitterness of soul and prayed to the Lord! Bitterness of
   soul should always be thus sweetened. Many are in bitterness of soul,
   but they do not pray and, therefore, the taste of the wormwood remains.
   O that they were wise and looked upon their sorrows as the Divine call
   for prayer, the cloud which brings a shower of supplication! Our
   troubles should be steeds upon which we ride to God--rough winds which
   hurry our boat into the haven of all-prayer! When the heart is merry we
   may sing Psalms, but concerning the afflicted it is written, "Let him
   pray." Thus, bitterness of spirit may be an index of our need of prayer
   and an incentive to that holy exercise. O daughter of sorrow, if in
   your darkened chamber you shall learn the are of prevailing with the
   Well-Beloved, yon bright-eyed maidens, down whose cheeks no tears have
   ever rushed, may well envy you, for to be proficient in the are and
   mystery of prayer is to be as a prince with God! May God grant that if
   we are of a sorrowful spirit, we may in the same proportion be of a
   prayerful spirit and we need scarcely desire a change.

   In the next place, Hannah had learned self-denial. This is clear since
   the very prayer by which she hoped to escape out of her great grief was
   a self-denying one. She desired a son, that her reproach might be
   removed. But if her eyes might be blessed with such a sight she would
   cheerfully resign her darling to be the Lord's as long as he lived!
   Mothers wish to keep their children about them. It is natural that they
   should wish to see them often. But Hannah, when most eager for a
   man-child, asking but for one and that one as the special gift of God,
   yet does not seek him for herself, but for her God! She has it on her
   heart that as soon as she has weaned him, she will take him up to the
   house of God and leave him there as a dedicated child whom she can only
   see at certain festivals.

   Read her own words--"O Lord of Hosts, if You will, indeed, look on the
   affliction of Your handmaid and remember me and not forget Your
   handmaid, but will give unto Your handmaid a man-child, then I will
   give him unto the Lord all the days of his life and there shall no
   razor come upon his head." Her heart longs not to see her boy at home--
   his father's daily pride and her own hourly solace--but to see him
   serving as a Levite in the house of the Lord! She thus proved that she
   had learned self-denial. Brothers and Sisters, this is one of our
   hardest lessons--to learn to give up what we most prize at the command
   of God and to do so cheerfully. This is real self-denial when we,
   ourselves, make the proposition and offer the sacrifice freely as she
   did.

   To desire a blessing that we may have the opportunity of parting with
   it--this is self-conquest--have we reached it? O you of a sorrowful
   spirit, if you have learned to crucify the flesh; if you have learned
   to keep under the body; if you have learned to cast all your desires
   and wills at His feet, you have gained what a thousand times repays you
   for all the losses and crosses you have suffered! Personally, I bless
   God for joy. I think I could sometimes do with a little more of it, but
   I fear, when I take stock of my whole life, that I have very seldom
   made any real growth in Grace except as the result

   of being dug about and fed by the stern husbandry of pain. My leaf is
   greenest in showery weather. My fruit is sweetest when it has been
   frosted by a winter's night.

   Another precious thing had come to this woman and that was she had
   learned faith. She had become proficient in believing promises. It is
   very beautiful to note how, at one moment she was in bitterness, but as
   soon as Eli had said, "Go in peace and the God of Israel grant you your
   petition that you have asked of Him," "the woman went her way and did
   eat and her countenance was no more sad." She had not yet obtained the
   blessing, but she was persuaded of the promise and embraced it--after
   that Christly fashion which our Lord taught us when He said, "Believe
   that you have the petitions which you have asked and you shall have
   them." She wiped her tears and smoothed the wrinkles from her brow
   knowing that she was heard! By faith she held a man-child in her arms
   and presented it to the Lord.

   This is no small virtue to attain. When a sorrowful spirit has learned
   to believe God, to roll its burden upon Him and to bravely expect
   succor and help from Him, it has learned by its losses how to make its
   best gains--by its griefs how to unfold its richest joys. Hannah is one
   of the honored band who, through faith, "received promises," therefore,
   O you who are of a sorrowful spirit, there is no reason why you should
   not, also, be of a believing spirit, even as she was! Still more of
   preciousness this woman of a sorrowful spirit found growing out of her
   sorrow, but with one invaluable item I shall close the list--she had
   evidently learned much of God. Driven from common family joys she had
   been drawn near to God and, in that heavenly fellowship, she had
   remained a humble waiter and watcher.

   In seasons of sacred nearness to the Lord she had made many heavenly
   discoveries of His name and Nature, as her son makes us perceive.
   First, she now knew that the heart's truest joy is not in children, nor
   even in mercies given in answer to prayer, for she began to sing, "My
   heart rejoices in the Lord"--not, "in Samuel"--but in Jehovah her chief
   delight was found. "My horn is exalted in the Lord"--not, "in that
   little one whom I have so gladly brought up to the sanctuary." No. She
   says in the first verse, "I rejoice in Your salvation," and it was even
   so. God was her exceeding joy and His salvation her delight. Oh, it is
   a great thing to be taught to put earthly things in their proper places
   and when they make you glad, yet to feel, "My gladness is in God; not
   in corn and wine and oil, but in the Lord Himself; all my fresh springs
   are in Him."

   Next, she had also discovered the Lord's glorious holiness, for she
   sang, "There is none holy as the Lord." The wholeness of His perfect
   Character charmed and impressed her and she sang of Him as far above
   all others in His goodness. She had perceived His all-sufficiency. She
   saw that He is All in All, for she sang, "There is none beside You;
   neither is there any rock like our God." She had found out God's method
   in Providence, for how sweetly she sings, "The bows of the mighty men
   are broken and they that stumbled are girded with strength." She knew
   that this was always God's way--to overturn those who are strong in
   self and to set up those who are weak. It is God's way to unite the
   strong with weakness and to bless the weak with strength. It is God's
   peculiar way and He abides by it. The full He empties and the empty He
   fills. Those who boast of the power to live, He slays and those who
   faint before Him as dead, He makes alive.

   She had also been taught the way and method of His Grace as well as of
   His Providence, for never did a woman show more acquaintance with the
   wonders of Divine Grace than she did when she sang, "He raises up the
   poor out of the dust and lifts up the beggar from the dunghill, to set
   them among princes and to make them inherit the Throne of Glory." This,
   too, is another of those ways of the Lord which are only understood by
   His people. She had also seen the Lord's faithfulness to His people.
   Some Christians, even in these Gospel days, do not believe in the
   doctrine of the Final Perseverance of the Saints, but she did! She
   sang, "He will keep the feet of His saints" and, Beloved, so He will,
   or none of them will ever stand! She had foreseen, also, somewhat of
   His kingdom and of the Glory of it. Her prophetic eyes, made brighter
   and clearer by her holy tears, enabled her to look into the future and
   looking, her joyful heart made her sing, "He shall give strength unto
   His King and exalt the horn of His Anointed."

   And now, lastly, much that is precious will yet be given to those who
   are truly the Lord's, even though they have a sorrowful spirit. For,
   first, Hannah had her prayers answered. Ah, little could she have
   imagined, when Eli was rebuking her for drunkenness, that within a
   short time she should be there and the same priest would look at her
   with deep respect and delight because the Lord had favored her. And
   you, my dear Friend of a sorrowful spirit, would not weep so much,
   tonight, if you knew what is in store for you. You would not weep at
   all if you guessed how soon all will change and, like Sarah, you will
   laugh for very joy! You are very poor; you scarcely know where you will
   place your head tonight; but if you knew in how short a time you will
   be among the angels, your penury would not cause you much distress!

   You are sickening and pining away and will soon go to your last Home.
   You would not be so depressed if you remembered how bright, around your
   head, will shine the starry diadem and how sweetly your tongue shall
   pour forth heavenly sonnets such as none can sing but those who, like
   you, have tasted of the bitter waters of grief! It is better than
   before! It is better than before! Let these things cheer you if you are
   of a sorrowful spirit. There shall be a fulfillment of the things which
   God has promised to you. Eye has not seen, nor ear heard the things He
   has laid up for you, but His Spirit reveals them to you at this hour!

   Not only did there come to Hannah, after her sorrow, an answered
   prayer, but Grace to use that answer. I do not think that Hannah would
   have been a fit mother for Samuel if she had not, first of all, been of
   a sorrowful spirit. It is not everybody that can be trusted to educate
   a young Prophet. Many a fool of a woman has made a fool of her child.
   He was so much her "duck" that he grew up to be a goose! It needs a
   wise woman to train up a wise son and, therefore, I regard Samuel's
   eminent character and career as largely the fruit of his mother's
   sorrow and as a reward for her griefs. Hannah was a thoughtful mother
   which was something and her thought induced diligence. She had slender
   space in which to educate her boy, for he left her early to wear the
   little coat and minister before the Lord. But in that space her work
   was effectually done, for the child Samuel worshiped the very day she
   took him up to the Temple.

   In many of our homes we have a well-drawn picture of a child at prayer
   and such, I doubt not, was the very image of the youthful Samuel. I
   like to think of him with that little coat on--that linen ephod--coming
   forth in solemn style, as a child-servant of God to help in the
   services of the Temple. Hannah had acquired another blessing and that
   was the power to magnify the Lord. Those sweet songs of hers,
   especially that precious one which we have been reading--where did she
   get it from? I will tell you! You have picked up a shell, have you not,
   by the seaside and you have put it to your ear and heard it sing of the
   wild waves? Where did it learn this music? In the deeps! It had been
   tossed to and fro in the rough sea until it learned to talk with a
   deep, soft meaning of mysterious things which only the salt sea caves
   can communicate. Hannah's poetry was born of her sorrow and if everyone
   here that is of a sorrowful spirit can but learn to tune his harp as
   sweetly as she tuned hers, he may be right glad to have passed through
   such griefs as she endured.

   Moreover, her sorrow prepared her to receive further blessings, for
   after the birth of Samuel she had three more sons and two
   daughters--God thus giving her five for the one that she had dedicated
   to Him! This was grand interest for her loan--500 percent! Parting with
   Samuel was the necessary preface to the reception of other little ones.
   God cannot bless some of us till, first of all, He has tried us. Many
   of us are not fit to receive a great blessing till we have gone through
   the fire. Half the men that have been ruined by popularity have been so
   ruined because they did not undergo a preparatory course of opprobrium
   and shame! Half the men who perish by riches do so because they had not
   toiled to earn them but made a lucky hit and became wealthy in an hour.

   Passing through the fire anneals the weapon which afterwards is to be
   used in the conflict! And Hannah gained Divine Grace to be greatly
   favored by being greatly sorrowing. Her name stands among the
   highly-favored women because she was deeply sorrowing. Last of all, it
   was by suffering in patience that she became so brave a witness for the
   Lord and could so sweetly sing, "There is none holy as the Lord,
   neither is there any rock like our God." We cannot bear testimony
   unless we test the promise and, therefore, happy is the man whom the
   Lord tests and qualifies to leave a testimony to the world that God is
   true. To that witness I would set my own personal seal.

                         Salvation by Knowing the Truth

   A Sermon

   (No. 1516)

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   God our Savior; who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the
   knowledge of the truth.'1 Timothy 2:3, 4.

   MAY GOD THE HOLY GHOST guide our meditations to the best practical
   result this evening, that sinners may be saved and saints stirred up to
   diligence. I do not intend to treat my text controversially. It is like
   the stone which makes the corner of a building, and it looks towards a
   different side of the gospel from that which is mostly before us. Two
   sides of the building of truth meet here. In many a village there is a
   corner where the idle and the quarrelsome gather together; and theology
   has such corners. It would be very easy indeed to set ourselves in
   battle array, and during the next half-hour to carry on a very fierce
   attack against those who differ from us in opinion upon points which
   could be raised from this text. I do not see that any good would come
   of it, and, as we have very little time to spare, and life is short, we
   had better spend it upon something that may better tend to our
   edification. May the good Spirit preserve us from a contentious spirit,
   and help us really to profit by his word.

   It is quite certain that when we read that God will have all men to be
   saved it does not mean that he wills it with the force of a decree or a
   divine purpose, for, if he did, then all men would be saved. He willed
   to make the world, and the world was made: he does not so will the
   salvation of all men, for we know that all men will not be saved.
   Terrible as the truth is, yet is it certain from holy writ that there
   are men who, in consequence of their sin and their rejection of the
   Savior, will go away into everlasting punishment, where shall be
   weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth. There will at the last be
   goats upon the left hand as well as sheep on the right, tares to be
   burned as well as wheat to be garnered, chaff to be blown away as well
   as corn to be preserved. There will be a dreadful hell as well as a
   glorious heaven, and there is no decree to the contrary.

   What then? Shall we try to put another meaning into the text than that
   which it fairly bears? I trow not. You must, most of you, be acquainted
   with the general method in which our older Calvinistic friends deal
   with this text. All men,' say they,'that is, some men': as if the Holy
   Ghost could not have said some men' if he had meant some men. All men,'
   say they; that is, some of all sorts of men': as if the Lord could not
   have said all sorts of men' if he had meant that. The Holy Ghost by the
   apostle has written all men,' and unquestionably he means all men. I
   know how to get rid of the force of the alls' according to that
   critical method which some time ago was very current, but I do not see
   how it can be applied here with due regard to truth. I was reading just
   now the exposition of a very able doctor who explains the text so as to
   explain it away; he applies grammatical gunpowder to it, and explodes
   it by way of expounding it. I thought when I read his exposition that
   it would have been a very capital comment upon the text if it had read,
   Who will not have all men to be saved, nor come to a knowledge of the
   truth.' Had such been the inspired language every remark of the learned
   doctor would have been exactly in keeping, but as it happens to say,
   Who will have all men to be saved,' his observations are more than a
   little out of place. My love of consistency with my own doctrinal views
   is not great enough to allow me knowingly to alter a single text of
   Scripture. I have great respect for orthodoxy, but my reverence for
   inspiration is far greater. I would sooner a hundred times over appear
   to be inconsistent with myself than be inconsistent with the word of
   God. I never thought it to be any very great crime to seem to be
   inconsistent with myself; for who am I that I should everlastingly be
   consistent? But I do think it a great crime to be so inconsistent with
   the word of God that I should want to lop away a bough or even a twig
   from so much as a single tree of the forest of Scripture. God forbid
   that I should cut or shape, even in the least degree, any divine
   expression. So runs the text, and so we must read it, God our Savior;
   who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of
   the truth.'

   Does not the text mean that it is the wish of God that men should be
   saved? The word wish' gives as much force to the original as it really
   requires, and the passage should run thus'whose wish it is that all men
   should be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth.' As it is my wish
   that it should be so, as it is your wish that it might be so, so it is
   God's wish that all men should be saved; for, assuredly, he is not less
   benevolent than we are. Then comes the question, But if he wishes it to
   be so, why does he not make it so? Beloved friend, have you never heard
   that a fool may ask a question which a wise man cannot answer, and, if
   that be so, I am sure a wise person, like yourself, can ask me a great
   many questions which, fool as I am, I am yet not foolish enough to try
   to answer. Your question is only one form of the great debate of all
   the ages,'If God be infinitely good and powerful, why does not his
   power carry out to the full all his beneficence?' It is God's wish that
   the oppressed should go free, yet there are many oppressed who are not
   free. It is God's wish that the sick should not suffer. Do you doubt
   it? Is it not your own wish? And yet the Lord does not work a miracle
   to heal every sick person. It is God's wish that his creatures should
   be happy. Do you deny that? He does not interpose by any miraculous
   agency to make us all happy, and yet it would be wicked to suppose that
   he does not wish the happiness of all the creatures that he has made.
   He has an infinite benevolence which, nevertheless, is not in all
   points worked out by his infinite omnipotence; and if anybody asked me
   why it is not, I cannot tell. I have never set up to be an explainer of
   all difficulties, and I have no desire to do so. It is the same old
   question as that of the negro who said, Sare, you say the devil makes
   sin in the world.' Yes, the devil makes a deal of sin.' And you say
   that God hates sin.' Yes.' Then why does not he kill the devil and put
   an end to it?' Just so. Why does he not? Ah, my black friend, you will
   grow white before that question is answered. I cannot tell you why God
   permits moral evil, neither can the ablest philosopher on earth, nor
   the highest angel in heaven.

   This is one of those things which we do not need to know. Have you
   never noticed that some people who are ill and are ordered to take
   pills are foolish enough to chew them? That is a very nauseous thing to
   do, though I have done it myself. The right way to take medicine of
   such a kind is to swallow it at once. In the same way there are some
   things in the Word of God which are undoubtedly true which must be
   swallowed at once by an effort of faith, and must not be chewed by
   perpetual questioning. You will soon have I know not what of doubt and
   difficulty and bitterness upon your soul if you must needs know the
   unknowable, and have reasons and explanations for the sublime and the
   mysterious. Let the difficult doctrines go down whole into your very
   soul, by a grand exercise of confidence in God.

   I thank God for a thousand things I cannot understand. When I cannot
   get to know the reason why, I say to myself, Why should I know the
   reason why? Who am I, and what am I, that I should demand explanations
   of my God?' I am a most unreasonable being when I am most reasonable,
   and when my judgment is most accurate I dare not trust it. I had rather
   trust my God. I am a poor silly child at my very best: my Father must
   know better than I. An old parable-maker tells us that he shut himself
   up in his study because he had to work out a difficult problem. His
   little child came knocking at the door, and he said Go away, John: you
   cannot understand what father is doing; let father alone.' Master
   Johnny for that very reason felt that he must get in and see what
   father was doing'a true symbol of our proud intellects; we must pry
   into forbidden things, and uncover that which is concealed. In a little
   time upon the sill, outside the window, stood Master Johnny, looking in
   through the window at his father; and if his father had not with the
   very tenderest care just taken him away from that very dangerous
   position, there would have been no Master Johnny left on the face of
   the earth to exercise his curiosity in dangerous elevations. Now, God
   sometimes shuts the door, and says, My child, it is so: be content to
   believe.' But,' we foolishly cry. Lord, why is it so?' It is so, my
   child,' he says. But why, Father, is it so?' It is so, my child,
   believe me.' Then we go speculating, climbing the ladders of reasoning,
   guessing, speculating, to reach the lofty windows of eternal truth.
   Once up there we do not know where we are, our heads reel, and we are
   in all kinds of uncertainty and spiritual peril. If we mind things too
   high for us we shall run great risks. I do not intend meddling with
   such lofty matters. There stands the text, and I believe that it is my
   Father's wish that all men should be saved, and come to the knowledge
   of the truth.' But I know, also, that he does not will it, so that he
   will save any one of them, unless they believe in his dear Son; for he
   has told us over and over that he will not. He will not save any man
   except he forsakes his sins, and turns to him with full purpose of
   heart: that I also know. And I know, also, that he has a people whom he
   will save, whom by his eternal love he has chosen, and whom by his
   eternal power he will deliver. I do not know how that squares with
   this; that is another of the things I do not know. If I go on telling
   you of all that I do not know, and of all that I do know, I will
   warrant you that the things that I do not know will be a hundred to one
   of the things that I do know. And so we will say no more about the
   matter, but just go on to the more practical part of the text. God's
   wish about man's salvation is this,'that men should be saved and come
   to the knowledge of the truth.

   Men are saved, and the same men that are saved come to a knowledge of
   the truth. The two things happen together, and the two facts very much
   depend upon each other. God's way of saving men is not by leaving them
   in ignorance. It is by a knowledge of the truth that men are saved;
   this will make the main body of our discourse, and in closing we shall
   see how this truth gives instruction to those who wish to be saved, and
   also to those who desire to save others. May the Holy Spirit make these
   closing inferences to be practically useful.

   Here is our proposition: IT IS BY A KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH THAT MEN ARE
   SAVED.

   Observe that stress is laid upon the article: it is the truth, and not
   every truth. Though it is a good thing to know the truth about
   anything, and we ought not to be satisfied to take up with a falsehood
   upon any point, yet it is not every truth that will save us. We are not
   saved by knowing any one theological truth we may choose to think of,
   for there are some theological truths which are comparatively of
   inferior value. They are not vital or essential, and a man may know
   them, and yet may not be saved. It is the truth which saves. Jesus
   Christ is the truth: the whole testimony of God about Christ is the
   truth. The work of the Holy Ghost in the heart is to work in us the
   truth. The knowledge of the truth is a large knowledge. It is not
   always so at the first: it may begin with but a little knowledge, but
   it is a large knowledge when it is further developed, and the soul is
   fully instructed in the whole range of the truth.

   This knowledge of the grand facts which are here called the truth saves
   men, and we will notice its mode of operation. Very often it begins its
   work in a man by arousing him, and thus it saves him from carelessness.
   He did not know anything about the truth which God has revealed, and so
   he lived like a brute beast. If he had enough to eat and to drink he
   was satisfied. If he laid by a little money he was delighted. So long
   as the days passed pretty merrily, and he was free from aches and
   pains, he was satisfied. He heard about religion, but he thought it did
   not concern him. He supposed that there were some people who might be
   the better for thinking about it, but as far as he was concerned, he
   thought no more about God or godliness than the ox of the stall or the
   ostrich of the desert. Well, the truth came to him, and he received a
   knowledge of it. He knew only a part, and that a very dark and gloomy
   part of it, but it stirred him out of his carelessness, for he suddenly
   discovered that he was under the wrath of God. Perhaps he heard a
   sermon, or read a tract, or had a practical word addressed to him by
   some Christian friend, and he found out enough to know that he that
   believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed on the
   Son of God.' That startled him. God is angry with the wicked every
   day:'that amazed him. He had not thought of it, perhaps had not known
   it, but when he did know it, he could rest no longer. Then he came to a
   knowledge of this farther truth, that after death there would be a
   judgment, that he would rise again, and that, being risen, he would
   have to stand before the judgment-seat of God to give an account of the
   things which he had done in the body. This came home very strikingly to
   him. Perhaps, also, such a text as this flamed forth before him,'For
   every idle word that man shall speak he must give an account in the day
   of judgment.' His mind began to foresee that last tremendous day, when
   on the clouds of heaven Christ will conic and summon quick and dead, to
   answer at his judgment-seat for the whole of their lives. He did not
   know that before, but, knowing it, it startled and aroused him. I have
   known men, when first they have come to a knowledge of this truth,
   become unable to sleep. They have started up in the night. They have
   asked those who were with them to help them to pray. The next day they
   have been scarcely able to mind their business, for a dreadful sound
   has been in their ears. They feared lest they should stumble into the
   grave and into hell. Thus they were saved from carelessness. They could
   not go back to be the mere brute beasts they were before. Their eyes
   had been opened to futurity and eternity. Their spirits had been
   quickened'at least so much that they could not rest in that doltish,
   dull, dead carelessness in which they had formerly been found. They
   were shaken out of their deadly lethargy by a knowledge of the truth.

   The truth is useful to a man in another way: it saves him from
   prejudice. Often when men are awakened to know something about the
   wrath of God they begin to plunge about to discover divers methods by
   which they may escape from that wrath. Consulting, first of all, with
   themselves, they think that, if they can reform'give up their grosser
   sins, and if they can join with religious people, they will make it all
   right. And there are some who go and listen to a kind of religious
   teacher, who says, You must do good works. You must earn a good
   character. You must add to all this the ceremonies of our church. You
   must be particular and precise in receiving blessing only through the
   appointed channel of the apostolical succession.' Of the aforesaid
   mystical succession this teacher has the effrontery to assure his dupe
   that he is a legitimate instrument; and that sacraments received at his
   hands are means of grace. Under such untruthful notions we have known
   people who were somewhat aroused sit down again in a false peace. They
   have done all that they judged right and attended to all that they were
   told. Suddenly, by God's grace, they come to a knowledge of another
   truth, and that is that by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
   justified in the sight of God. They discover that salvation is not by
   works of the law or by ceremonies, and that if any man he under the law
   he is also under the curse. Such a text as the following conies home,
   Not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but
   of God'; and such another text as this, Ye must be born again,' and
   then this at the back of it'that which is born of the flesh is flesh,
   and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.' When they also find
   out that there is necessary a righteousness better than their own'a
   perfect righteousness to justify them before God, and when they
   discover that they must be made new creatures in Christ Jesus, or else
   they must utterly perish, then they are saved from false confidences,
   saved from crying, Peace, peace,' when there is no peace. It is a grand
   thing when a knowledge of the truth stops us from trusting in a lie. I
   am addressing some who remember when they were saved in that way. What
   an opening of the eyes it was to you! You had a great prejudice against
   the gospel of grace and the plan of salvation by faith; but when the
   Lord took you in hand and made you see your beautiful righteousness to
   be a moth-eaten mass of rags, and when the gold that you had
   accumulated suddenly turned into so much brass, cankered, and good for
   nothing,'when you stood stripped naked before God, and the poor cobwebs
   of ceremonies suddenly dropped from off you, oh, then the Lord was
   working his salvation in your soul, and you were being saved from false
   confidences by a knowledge of the truth.

   Moreover, it often happens that a knowledge of the truth stands a man
   in good stead for another purpose; it saves him from despair. Unable to
   be careless, and unable to find comfort in false confidences, some poor
   agitated minds are driven into a wide and stormy sea without rudder or
   compass, with nothing but wreck before them. There is no hope for me,'
   says the man. I perceive I cannot save myself. I see that I am lost. I
   am dead in trespasses and sins, and cannot stir hand or foot. Surely
   now I may as well go on in sin, and even multiply my transgressions.
   The gate of mercy is shut against me; what is the use of fear where
   there is no room for hope?' At such a time, if the Lord leads the man
   to a knowledge of the truth, he perceives that though his sins be as
   scarlet they shalt be as wool, and though they be red like crimson they
   shall be as white as snow. That precious doctrine of substitution comes
   in'that Christ stood in the stead of the sinner, that the transgression
   of his people was laid upon him, and that God, by thus avenging sin in
   the person of his dear Son, and honoring his law by the suffering of
   the Savior, is now able to declare pardon to the penitent and grace to
   the believing. Now, when the soul comes to know that sin is put away by
   the atoning blood; when the heart discovers that it is not our life
   that saves us, but the life of God that comes to dwell in us; that we
   are not to be regenerated by our own actions, but are regenerated by
   the Holy Ghost who comes to us through the precious death of Jesus,
   then despair flies away, and the soul cries exultingly, There is hope.
   There is hope. Christ died for sinners: why should I not have a part in
   that precious death? He came like a physician to heal the sick: why
   should he not heal me? Now I perceive that he does not want my
   goodness, but my badness; he does not need my righteousness, but my
   unrighteousness: for he came to save the ungodly and to redeem his
   people from their sins. I say, when the heart comes to a knowledge of
   this truth, then it is saved from despair; and this is no small part of
   the salvation of Jesus Christ.

   A saving knowledge of the truth, to take another line of things, works
   in this way. A knowledge of the truth shows a man his personal need of
   being saved. O you that are not saved, and who dream you do not need to
   be, you only require to know the truth, and you will perceive that you
   must he saved or lost for ever.

   A knowledge of the truth reveals the atonement by which we are saved: a
   knowledge of the truth shows us what that faith is by which the
   atonement becomes available for us: a knowledge of the truth teaches us
   that faith is the simple act of trusting, that it is not an action of
   which man may boast; it is not an action of the nature of a work, so as
   to he a fruit of the law; but faith is a self-denying grace which finds
   all its strength in him upon whom it lives, and lays all its honor upon
   him. Faith is not self in action but self forsaken, self abhorred, self
   put away that the soul may trust in Christ, and trust in Christ alone.
   There are persons now present who are puzzled about what faith is. We
   have tried to explain it a great many times to you, hut we have
   explained it so that you did not understand it any the better; and yet
   the same explanation has savingly instructed others. May God the Holy
   Ghost open your understandings that you may practically know what faith
   is, and at once exercise it. I suppose that it is a very hard thing to
   understand because it is so plain. When a man wishes the way of
   salvation to be difficult he naturally kicks at it because it is easy;
   and, when his pride wants it to be hard to be understood, he is pretty
   sure to say that he does not understand it because it is so plain. Do
   not you know that the unlettered often receive Christ when philosophers
   refuse him, and that he who has not called ninny of the great, and many
   of the mighty, has chosen poor, foolish, and despised things? That is
   because poor foolish men, you know, are willing to believe a plain
   thing, but men wise in their own conceits desire to be, if they can, a
   little confounded and puzzled that they may please themselves with the
   idea that their own superior intellect has made a discovery; and,
   because the way of salvation is just so easy that almost an idiot boy
   may lay hold of it, therefore they pretend that they do not understand
   it. Some people cannot see a thing because it is too high up; but there
   are others who cannot see it because it is too low down. Now, it so
   happens that the way of salvation by faith is so simple that it seems
   beneath the dignity of exceedingly clever men. May God bring them to a
   knowledge of this truth: may they see that they cannot be saved except
   by giving up all idea of saving themselves; that they cannot be saved
   except they step right into Christ, for, until they get to the end of
   the creature, they will never get to the beginning of the Creator. Till
   they empty out their pockets of every mouldy crust, and have not a
   crumb left; they cannot come and take the rich mercy which is stored up
   in Christ Jesus for every empty, needy sinner. May the Lord be pleased
   to give you that knowledge of the truth!

   When a man comes in very deed to a knowledge of the truth about faith
   in Christ, he trusts Christ, and he is there and then saved from the
   guilt of sin; and he begins to be saved altogether from sin. God cuts
   the root of the power of sin that very day; hut yet it has such life
   within itself that at the scent of water it will bud again. Sin in our
   members struggles to live. It has as many lives as a cat: there is no
   killing it. Now, when we conic to a knowledge of the truth, we begin to
   learn how sin is to be killed in us'how the same Christ that justifies,
   sanctifies, and works in us according to his working who worketh in us
   mightily, that we may he conformed to the image of Christ, and made
   meet to dwell with perfect saints above. Beloved, many of you that are
   saved from the guilt of sin, have a very hard struggle with the power
   of sin, and have much more conflict, perhaps, than yon need to have,
   because you have not come to a knowledge of all the truth about
   indwelling sin. I therefore beg you to study much the word of God upon
   that point, and especially to see the adaptation of Christ to rule over
   your nature, and to conquer all your corrupt desires, and learn how by
   faith to bring each sin before him that, like Agag, it may be hewed in
   pieces before his eyes. You will never overcome sin except by the blood
   of the Lamb. There is no sanctification except by faith. The same
   instrument which destroys sin as to its guilt must slay sin as to its
   power. They overcame by the blood of the Lamb,' and so must you. Learn
   this truth well, so shall you find salvation wrought in you from day to
   day.

   Now, I think I hear somebody say, I think I know all about this.' Yes,
   you may think you know it, and may not know anything at all about it.
   Oh, but,' says one, I do know it. I learned the Assembly's Catechism'
   when I was a child. I have read the Bible ever since, and I am well
   acquainted with all the commonplaces of orthodoxy.' That may be, dear
   friend, and yet you may not know the truth. I have heard of a man who
   knew how to swim, but, as he had never been in the water, I do not
   think much of his knowledge of swimming: in fact, he did not really
   know the art. I have heard of a botanist who understood all about
   flowers, but as he lived in London, and scarcely ever saw above one
   poor withered thing in a flowerpot, I do not think much of his botany.
   I have heard of a man who was a very great astronomer, but he had not a
   telescope, and I never thought much of his astronomy. So there are many
   persons who think they know and yet do not know because they have never
   had any personal acquaintance with the thing. A mere notional knowledge
   or a dry doctrinal knowledge is of no avail. We must know the truth in
   a very different way from that.

   How are we to know it, then? Well, we are to know it, first, by a
   believing knowledge. You do not know a thing unless you believe it to
   be really so. If you doubt it, you do not know it. If you say, I really
   am not sure it is true,' then you cannot say that you know it. That
   which the Lord has revealed in holy Scripture you must devoutly believe
   to be true. In addition to this, your knowledge, if it becomes
   believing knowledge, must be personal knowledgea persuasion that it is
   true in reference to yourself. It is true about your neighbor, about
   your brother, but you must believe it about yourself, or your knowledge
   is vain'for instance, you must know that you are lost'that you are in
   danger of eternal destruction from the presence of God'that for you
   there is no hope but in Christ'that for you there is hope if you rest
   in Christ'that resting in Christ you are saved. Yes, you. You must know
   that because you have trusted in Christ you are saved, and that now you
   are free from condemnation, and that now in you the new life has begun,
   which will fight against the old life of sin, until it overcome, and
   you, even you, are safely landed on the golden shore. There must be a
   personal appropriation of what you believe to be true. That is the kind
   of knowledge which saves the soul.

   But this must be a powerful knowledge, by which I mean that it must
   operate in and upon your mind. A man is told that his house is on fire.
   I will suppose that standing here I held up a telegram, and said, My
   friend, is your name so-and-so?' Yes.' Well, your house is on fire.' He
   knows the fact, does he not? Yes, but he sits quite still. Now, my
   impression is about that good brother, that he does not know, for he
   does not believe it. He cannot believe it, surely he may believe that
   somebody's house is on fire, but not his own. If it is his house which
   is burning, and he knows it, what does he do? Why he gets up and goes
   off to see what he can do towards saving his goods. That is the kind of
   knowledge which saves the soul'when a man knows the truth about
   himself, and therefore his whole nature is moved and affected by the
   knowledge. Do I know that I am in danger of hell fire? And am I in my
   senses? Then I shall never rest till I have escaped from that danger.
   Do I know that there is salvation for me in Christ? Then I never shall
   be content until I have obtained that salvation by the faith to which
   that salvation is promised: that is to say, if I really am in my
   senses, and if my sin has not made me beside myself as sin does, for
   sin works a moral madness upon the mind of man, so that he puts bitter
   for sweet and sweet for bitter, and dances on the jaws of hell, and
   sits down and scoffs at Almighty mercy, despises the precious blood of
   Christ and will have none of it, although there and there only is his
   salvation to be found.

   This knowledge when it comes really to save the soul is what we call
   experimental knowledgeknowledge acquired according to the exhortation
   of the psalmist, Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good'acquired by
   tasting. Now, at this present moment, I, speaking for myself, know that
   I am origin ally lost by nature. Do I believe it? Believe it? I am as
   sure of it as I am of my own existence. I know that I am lost by
   nature. It would not be possible for anybody to make me doubt that: I
   have felt it. How many weary days I spent under the pressure of that
   knowledge! Does a soldier know that there is such a thing as a cat when
   he has had a hundred lashes? It would take a deal of argument to make
   him believe there is not such a thing, or that backs do not smart when
   they feel the lash. Oh, how my soul smarted under the lash of
   conscience when I suffered under a sense of sin! Do I know that I could
   not save myself? Know it? Why, my poor, struggling heart labored this
   way and that, even as in the very fire with bitter disappointment, for
   I labored to climb to the stars on a treadwheel, and I was trying and
   trying and trying with all my might, but never rose an inch higher. I
   tried to fill a bottomless tub with leaking buckets, and worked on and
   toiled and slaved, but never accomplished even the beginning of my
   unhappy task. I know, for I have tried it, that salvation is not in
   man, or in all the feelings, and weepings, and prayings, and Bible
   readings, and church goings, and chapel goings which zeal could crowd
   together. Nothing whatsoever that man does can avail him towards his
   own salvation. This I know by sad trial of it, and failure in it.

   But I do know that there is real salvation by believing in Christ. Know
   it? I have never preached to you concerning that subject what I do not
   know by experience. In a moment, when I believed in Christ I leaped
   from despair to fullness of delight. Since I have believed in Jesus I
   have found myself totally new'changed altogether from what I was; and I
   find now that, in proportion as I trust in Jesus, I love God and try to
   serve him; but if at any time I begin to trust in myself, I forget my
   God, and I become selfish and sinful. Just as I keep on being nothing
   and taking Christ to be everything, so am I led in the paths of
   righteousness. I am merely talking of myself, because a man cannot bear
   witness about other people so thoroughly us he can about himself. I am
   sure that all of you who have tried my Master can bear the same
   witness. You have been saved, and you have come to a knowledge of the
   truth experimentally; and every soul here that would be saved must in
   the same way believe the truth, appropriate the truth, act upon the
   truth, and experimentally know the truth, which is summed up in few
   words:'Man lost: Christ his Savior. Man nothing: God all in all. The
   heart depraved: the Spirit working the new life by faith.' The Lord
   grant that these truths may come home to your hearts with power.

   I am now going to draw two inferences which are to be practical. The
   first one is this: in regard TO YOU THAT ARE SEEKING SALVATION. Does
   not the text show you that it is very possible that the reason why you
   have not found salvation is because you do not know the truth? Hence, I
   do most earnestly entreat the many of you young people who cannot get
   rest to be very diligent searchers of your Bibles. The first thing and
   the main thing is to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, but if you say,'
   I do not understand it,' or I cannot believe,' or if there be any such
   doubt rising in your mind, then it may be because you have not gained
   complete knowledge of the truth. It is very possible that somebody will
   say to you, Believe, believe, believe.' I would say the same to you,
   but I should like you to act upon the common-sense principle of knowing
   what is to be believed and in whom you are to believe. I explained this
   to one who came to me a few evenings ago. She said that she could not
   believe. Well,' I said, now suppose as you sit in that chair I say to
   you, Young friend, I cannot believe in you': you would say to me, I
   think you should.' Suppose I then replied, I wish I could.' What would
   you bid me do? Should I sit still and look at you till I said, I think
   I can believe in you'? That would be ridiculous. No, I should go and
   enquire, Who is this young person? What kind of character does she
   bear? What are her connections?' and when I knew all about you, then I
   have no doubt that I should say, I have made examination into this
   young woman's character, and I cannot help believing in her.' Now, it
   is just so with Jesus Christ. If you say, I cannot believe in him,'
   read those four blessed testimonies of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
   and especially linger much over those parts where they tell you of his
   death. Do you know that many, while they have been sitting, as it were,
   at the foot of the cross, viewing the Son of God dying for men, have
   cried out, I cannot help believing. I cannot help believing. When I see
   my sin, it seems too great; hut when I see my Savior my iniquity
   vanishes away.' I think I have put it to you sometimes like this: if
   you take a ride through London, from end to end, it will take you many
   days to get an idea of its vastness; for probably none of us know the
   size of London. After your long ride of inspection you will say,' I
   wonder how those people can all be fed. I cannot make it out. Where
   does all the bread come from, and all the butter, and all the cheese,
   and all the meat, and everything else? Why, these people will be
   starved. It is not possible that Lebanon with all its beasts, and the
   vast plains of Europe and America should ever supply food sufficient
   for all this multitude.' That is your feeling. And then, to-morrow
   morning you get up, and you go to Covent Garden, you go to the great
   meat-markets, and to other sources of supply, and when you come home
   you say, I feel quite different now, for now 1 cannot make out where
   all the people come from to eat all this provision: I never saw such
   store of food in all my life. Why, if there were two Londons, surely
   there is enough here to feed them.' Just so'when you think about your
   sins and your wants you get saying, How can I be saved?' Now, turn your
   thoughts the other way; think that Christ is the Son of God: think of
   what the merit must be of the incarnate God's hearing human guilt; and
   instead of saying, My sin is too great,' you will almost think the
   atoning sacrifice too great. Therefore I do urge you to try and know
   more of Christ; and I am only giving you the advice of Isaiah, Incline
   your ear, and come unto me; hear, and your soul shall live.' Know,
   hear, read, and believe more about these precious things, always with
   this wish'I am not hearing for hearing's sake, and I am not wishing to
   know for knowing's sake, but I am wanting to hear and to know that I
   may be saved.' I want you to be like the woman that lost her piece of
   silver. She did not light a candle and then say, Bravo, I have lit a
   candle, this is enough.' She did not take her broom and then sit down
   content, crying, What a splendid broom.' When she raised a dust she did
   not exclaim, What a dust I am making! I am surely making progress now.'
   Some poor sinners, when they have been seeking, get into a dust of
   soul-trouble, and think it to be a comfortable sign. No, I'll warrant
   you, the woman wanted her groat: she did not mind the broom, or the
   dust, or the candle; she looked for the silver. So it must be with you.
   Never content yourself with the reading, the hearing, or the feeling.
   It is Christ you want. It is the precious piece of money that you must
   find; and you must sweep until you find it. Why, there it is! There is
   Jesus! Take him! Take him! Believe him now, even now, and you are
   saved.

   The last inference is for YOU WHO DESIRE TO SAVE SINNERS. You must,
   dear friends, bring the truth before them when you want to bring them
   to Jesus Christ. I believe that exciting meetings do good to some. Men
   are so dead and careless that almost anything is to be tolerated that
   wakes them up; but for real solid soul-work before God' telling men the
   truth is the main thing. What truth? It is gospel truth, truth about
   Christ that they want. Tell it in a loving, earnest, affectionate
   manner, for God wills that they should be saved, not in any other way,
   but in this way'by a knowledge of the truth. He wills that all men
   should be saved in this way'not by keeping them in ignorance, but by
   bringing the truth before them. That is God's way of saving them. Have
   your Bible handy when you are reasoning with a soul. Just say, Let me
   call your attention to this passage.' It has a wonderful power over a
   poor staggering soul to point to the Book itself. Say, Did you notice
   this promise, my dear friend? And have you seen that passage?' Have the
   Scriptures handy. There is a dear brother of mine here whom God blesses
   to many souls, and I have seen him talking to some, and turning to the
   texts very handily. I wondered how he did it so quickly, till I looked
   in his Bible, and found that he hind the choice texts printed on two
   leaves and inserted into the book, so that he could always open upon
   them. That is a capital plan, to get the cheering words ready to hand,
   the very ones that you know have comforted you and have comforted
   others. It sometimes happens that one single verse of God's word will
   make the light to break into a soul, when fifty days of reasoning would
   not do it. I notice that when souls are saved it is by our texts rather
   than by our sermons. God the Holy Ghost loves to use his own sword. It
   is God's word, not man's comment on God's word, that God usually
   blesses. Therefore, stick to the quotation of the Scripture itself, and
   rely upon the truth. If a man could be saved by a lie it would be a
   lying salvation. Truth alone can work results that are true. Therefore,
   keep on teaching the truth. God help you to proclaim the precious truth
   about the bleeding, dying, risen, exalted, coming Savior; and God will
   bless it.

  LETTER FROM MR. SPURGEON.

   DEAR FRIENDS,'Accept again my heartiest salutations. I hope soon to
   issue sermons preached at home on the previous Sabbaths, for I purpose,
   if the Lord will, to leave this shelter on February 2, or thereabouts.
   Six weeks of continuous fine weather have by God's blessing delivered
   me from my pains, and enabled me to regain a large measure of strength;
   and the daily good tidings from home has also helped to quiet my mind
   and revive my spirit. O that I may be the better for this affliction.
   As after heavy showers the fountains and brooks run with new force and
   fullness, so may it be with these sermons now that with me the rain is
   over and gone.' If you, dear readers, are the more refreshed I shall
   count pain and weakness to be a small cost for so blessed a result.

   Yours most heartily

                         For the Candid and Thoughtful

   A Sermon

   (No. 1517)

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   And when Jesus saw' ['saw him,' so it should be] that he answered
   discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of
   God.'Mark 12:34.

   THIS MAN BEGAN with Christ as a foe, and he ended as a friend. It does
   not quite appear from Mark, but it is plainly stated by Matthew, that
   the scribe asked a question of the Savior tempting him.' He was,
   therefore, an enemy. Put the mildest sense you like on the word tempt'
   and it will retain the idea of an unfriendly testing; yet nothing could
   be more hearty in the end than the verdict with which he commended our
   Lord's answer, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth.' Our Lord Jesus
   Christ has an almighty power over men's minds; he possesses
   irresistible charms by which he turns adversaries into advocates. He
   has a secret key which fits the wards of human hearts, and he can open
   that which seems to be the most securely closed against him. Never man
   spake like this man,' for in his voice, even in his humiliation, there
   were traces of the eternal fiat which of old spake the primeval
   midnight into noon.

   It strikes me that this scribe was half-hearted in the work of tempting
   our Lord, even at the first. I should imagine him to have been a very
   superior man amongst his fellows, a man of greater light and
   discernment than the rest, and of greater ability in statement and
   discussion. Possibly for this cause his brother scribes selected him,
   and put him forward to ask the testing questions. Now, it will
   sometimes happen that a man is thrust forward by others to do what he
   would never have thought of doing of his own accord, and quite
   unwillingly he acts as the mouthpiece of a set of people whom he half
   despises. Our Lord Jesus Christ is a ready reader of human hearts, and
   he very soon discovers whether what a man does is being done of himself
   or whether he is acted upon by a power behind. He discerns the
   difference between the malicious adversary and the less guilty victim
   of circumstances. These words of mine may be reaching persons who have
   opposed a religious movement, or fought against a gracious truth, not
   because they themselves would have done so if they had been left alone,
   but others have egged them on and made use of them, and thus they have
   been drawn or driven into a false position. The people whom they have
   been accustomed to lead have led them: it is too often the fate of
   leaders. The circle of which they have been the center and the head has
   imprisoned its own apparent master, and made him captive, so that he
   fights against that which in his heart he half suspects to be right.
   If, even now, he could be set free from his surroundings he would side
   with the right. Friend, my blessed Master can read your heart, and
   understand the pressure under which you are acting. I pray that as he
   reads your inmost soul he may see what of good there remaineth among
   the evil, and deliver you out of the false and dangerous position into
   which you have drifted. Jesus can set you right, my friend'can take you
   away from the entanglements of your surroundings, sever you from those
   who are making a tool of you, but who are at the same time sinking you
   down to their own level: can bring you to be his own friend, and lift
   you up to his own standard, so that you too shall be the champion of
   everything that is good and true, and shall go forward with him as your
   Master, bearing his cross, and looking to wear his crown.

   Although the scribe in the narrative before us appeared first under the
   aspect of an antagonist, and tried to tempt our Lord, yet before long
   the great Teacher had put him into such a mental condition that he said
   of him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.' At this time I shall
   first notice the commendation which is here expressed; and then, in the
   second place, I shall dwell for a little while upon the question which
   is here suggestedsuggested, I think, by no idle curiosity, but very
   naturally suggested: Did this man, who was so near to the kingdom,
   actually enter it, or did he not?

   I. May the Holy Spirit instruct and impress us while, first, we
   consider the COMMENDATION EXPRESSED:'THOU art not far from the kingdom
   of God.' I am not going to use this text after the usual fashion. It
   has been made the heading of a catalogue of characters who are supposed
   to be not far from the kingdom of God. It is a very proper thing to
   address hopeful persons, and to give descriptions of conditions about
   which there is much that is cheering, and yet much to create anxiety;
   but the text itself does not deal with many cases, but with one whom
   Jesus judged to be not far from the kingdom of God, of whom it gives us
   such information that we see why he was thus spoken of. It speaks of
   one particular individual: Thou art not far from the kingdom of God';
   and it tells us that Jesus said this because he saw that he answered
   discreetly. We may infer without fear of mistake that any man who would
   answer as this man answered is not far from the kingdom of God. Let us
   read his answer: Master, thou hast said the truth; for there is one
   God, and there is none other but he; and to love him with all the
   heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with
   all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more than all
   whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.'

   With care let us investigate this reply, and see how far it might be
   our own language. The first point in which our Savior saw that the
   scribe was not far from the kingdom of God was this, that he possessed
   candour, and possessed so much of it that he rose superior to party
   considerations. He was a scribe, and naturally he took the side of the
   scribes and pharisees, but still he was not so much a scribe and
   pharisee that he would follow them against the truth. He kept himself
   open to conviction, and as soon as the Savior had given a fitting
   answer to the question, he did not, as other pharisees would have done,
   sneer at him, and continue still to pick fresh holes in his coat, but,
   like a candid man, he said, Well, master, thou hast answered rightly';
   and thus he did, as it were, separate himself from the unjust and
   bigoted party for whom he had been the temporary spokesman. He did not
   avow himself to be a disciple of Christ, yet he gave the great Teacher
   his due, and said of him what he felt bound to say, namely, that he had
   answered rightly. Now, my brethren, there is always some hope of a man
   who is candid, and there is more hope still of one who, being placed by
   circumstances amongst the bigoted and prejudiced, nevertheless breaks
   away from bondage, keeps a conscience, preserves his eye from total
   blindness, is willing to see light if light is to be had, and is
   anxious to know the truth if the truth can be brought before him. It
   gives me great delight to meet with such persons, even though they
   confess that they are of a sceptical turn of mind, when it is clear
   that they are ready to yield to evidence, and are not mere cavillers.
   Time is wasted upon men who have made up their minds, or who have no
   minds to make up, but enquirers are worth trouble, and those who will
   admit right and truth when they see it are among the most hopeful of
   hearers. We do not wish people to open their mouths and shut their eyes
   and swallow everything that we may like to give them, yet the mouth
   ought to be open, or at least willing to be opened, as well as the eye,
   or oar service at the gospel feast will be a weary task. When hearers
   are willing to receive the truth as well as to examine what they hear,
   they are in a good state. They will not only prove all things,' which a
   great many will do, but they are ready also to hold fast that which is
   good,' which some will not do: among such persons was the scribe.

   I will suppose that I am addressing one who has been brought up under a
   system which makes little of Christ. Perhaps your form of religion
   makes much of the priest, and of sacraments, but it does not say much
   of the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. There are faiths which make
   more of human things than of our divine Savior, the blessed Redeemer of
   sinners, and it may be that you profess one of these. Or you may have
   hitherto lived under a religion which makes much of your good works,
   and doings, and feelings, and so on. It may be that the Lord will
   enable you to rise superior to the influence of creeds, of education,
   and of association, and to say, I only wish to know God's way of
   salvation. My desire is to be guided by what the Lord has revealed. I
   am prepared to accept whatever is plainly taught in the Word of God,
   even should it reverse all my former beliefs, and deprive me of my most
   cherished consolations. With sincere heart I ask enlightenment from the
   divine Spirit.' Now, when we meet with a man of that kind, and see him
   hearing the gospel, we may say of him, Thou art not far from the
   kingdom of God.' These are the kind of people who feel the force of
   truth, and are converted to the faith of Jesus, these straightforward
   people, these hearty lovers of that which is good. The Savior called
   some men, honest and good ground,' and they were such even before the
   seed of the word fell upon them. Of course, even this natural openness
   and sincerity of character is God's gift, but assuredly these are the
   people upon whom the heavenly work takes most effect. Your tricksters,
   shufflers, players, make-believes, and men without principle or heart,
   are seldom converted. I speak from wide observation. I have seen scores
   of blustering blasphemers, who were downright in their profanity,
   brought to Jesus' feet, but I do not remember seeing a deceitful person
   brought there. Your deeply lying character'I will not say that it is
   beyond the power of grace to save him, but I will say this, it is the
   rarest thing under heaven for a man who has long been a liar ever to be
   converted. I will say nothing in the praise of human nature, nor give
   any reason for the absolutely free election of grace, but still I
   notice that for the most part there is a sort of honest openness and
   freedom from trickery about those whom the Lord calls to himself. I
   notice that characteristic in the first fishermen apostles, who were no
   doubt ignorant and weak, but they were as transparent as glass, and as
   free from guile as Nathanael. Even in their follies, and their sins,
   and their blunders they were always open-hearted, and so, in general,
   are those upon whom the Lord looks with an eye of love. Tricksters come
   in like Judas, but they go out again, for they are not of us. They
   experience no change from their association with godliness, or from
   their knowledge of truth, but would pick the purse of Christ himself,
   and sell their Redeemer for pieces of silver. Far otherwise is it with
   a man of candid and thorough spirit, for he is glad to receive the
   gospel, and it soon displays its gracious power in him. We may say of
   the candid man as Christ did of this scribe, Thou art not far from the
   kingdom of God.'

   A second point is, perhaps, even more clear. This man also possessed
   spiritual knowledge. It is a great error to suppose that ignorance can
   do anybody any good. There is a religion which prefers to have ignorant
   people to deal with, but we have learned the truth of what Solomon
   said: That the soul be without knowledge, it is not good.' To be
   ignorant of the law of God is to be far off from the kingdom; and to be
   ignorant of the gospel is also to be in a measure far off from the
   kingdom: but this man knew the law, and knew it well. He had a
   spiritual appreciation of its range, meaning, and spirituality. Notice
   how he puts it: he puts it well. He says, To love God with all the
   heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with
   all the strength,'this is the first commandment.' Here we see, first,
   that he mentions sincere love, in the words to love him with all the
   heart.' God is to be loved, not in name, not with lip language, not
   with mere pretense, but with the heart. God requireth by his law the
   hearty obedience of his creatures. Next, the scribe puts it, With all
   thy understanding ; that is, God deserves and demands the intelligent
   love of his creatures. He does not ask blind love of them: he desires
   them to know something of him, and of his works, and of his claims upon
   them, so as to love him because he deserves their affection. The
   understanding must justify and impel the affections. Then, he puts it,
   with all thy soul ; that is, with the emotional nature. Love God with
   feeling'not coolly, but with the whole force of your feeling. Love him
   with your soul, for soul love is the soul of love. And then he adds,
   and with all thy strength ; that is to say, intensity is to be thrown
   into our love to God. We are to serve him with our might, and throw all
   our whole energy into his worship. Thus he gives us, under four heads,
   a description of the kind of love which the law of God requires of
   us'sincere'with all thy heart'; intelligent'with all thy
   understanding'; emotional'with all thy soul'; intense and
   energetic'with all thy strength.' This the scribe knew, and it was most
   valuable knowledge. Beloved, when a man begins intelligently to grasp
   the doctrines of the law and the gospel, when we perceive that he is no
   stranger to divine things, but that he can give a reason for his
   beliefs, and can state them to others, although we dare not conclude
   because of this knowledge that such a man is actually in the kingdom of
   God, we may safely conclude that he is not far from it. Give us candor,
   and let that candour be attended with enlightenment, and we are sure
   that the possessor of these things is not far from the kingdom of God.

   A third point is more remarkable still, because it is to be feared that
   hundreds of professed Christians are nothing like so near to the
   kingdom of heaven as this man was. This scribe knew the superiority of
   an inward religion over that which is external, for he declares, To
   love him with all thy heart is more than whole burnt offerings and
   sacrifices.' Thousands at this hour are publicly teaching us that the
   principal point of religion is that you shall be duly and properly
   baptized and confirmed, and shall reverently and properly receive the
   sacrament. They lay stress upon your receiving before you have your
   breakfast, and upon the breaker of the sacred bread having been duly
   touched on the head by a bishop, and I do not know what else of mere
   outward circumstance. Books have been written about how the service is
   to be performed, and how it is not to be performed, and a great noise
   has been made about a piece of bread which was brought before a court
   of law. I believe a very great dignitary has been so weak as to certify
   that this baked dough has been reverently consumed': and yet this is
   not a heathen country, nor are we worshippers of fetishes! Great
   importance is attached to the style of garment, which should be worn by
   priests on Holy Monday, or Good Friday. Colours vary according to the
   almanack, and the age of the moon. I must confess I need all my gravity
   when I think of copes, and girdles, and surplices, and gowns being
   matters of serious discussion. Surely these poor dupes of superstition
   are far, very far, from the kingdom of God, which is not meat and
   drink, nor clothing, nor posture, but righteousness and peace and joy
   in the Holy Ghost. Their whole line of thought is alien to the mind of
   God, who is a spirit, and must be worshipped in spirit and in truth. In
   the whole business of exhibitional religion what is there to content
   the soul? What can there be in it to please God? If our God were a
   royal puppet I could conceive of his being pleased with ceremonial; or
   if he were like the heathens' idiotic deities I could understand that
   mummeries, masquerades, postures, processions, robes, and round-robins
   might please him; but seeing that he is God, the only wise, be it far
   from me to dream of such a thing. Such child's play can scarce be borne
   with by full-grown men, but for that glorious mind that filleth all
   immensity to be thought to be particular about the cut and color of a
   vestment seems to me to be little short of blasphemy. When the thing
   was typical of truth yet to be revealed, it was important; but now that
   the true light has risen, and the shadows have departed, no such
   explanation is possible. Can it really be true that courts of law and
   assemblies of the church discuss the question of men's turning to the
   east or to the west when they pray? Is it thought to be of some
   consequence how men shall turn, and twist, and bend? What god is this
   that they serve? What being is this that they adore? Certainly not
   Jehovah, the God of heaven, whom we worship, for he dwelleth not in
   temples made with hands,' that is to say, of this building; and he hath
   abolished all rubrics save this:'they that worship him must worship him
   in spirit and in truth.' Only spiritual worship is worship, and only as
   the heart adores does God accept the homage which is offered to him.
   This scribe knew that even whole burnt offerings, though God had
   ordained them, and they were therefore right, and sacrifices, though
   the law had settled them, and they were therefore due, were nothing
   when compared with loving God with all the heart and with all the soul.
   He expresses this most plainly that to love God with all the heart is
   more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.' And see how
   broadly he puts it'All whole burnt offerings and sacrifices' put
   together. If they could slay all the bullocks upon a thousand hills,
   and set Lebanon's self on fire, making it one huge altar upon which the
   holocaust should smoke, and even if they should pour out rivers of oil,
   and side by side with it ran streams of blood of fat beasts, yet all
   would be nothing. Who hath required this at their hands? The Lord's
   demands are not of this sort. Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest
   not.' What God asks is that we should love him first of all, and our
   neighbor as ourselves. Now, a man who has come so far as to shake off
   the superstition of confidence in external worship is not far from the
   kingdom of God. He who knows that if saved it will be by a spiritual
   change, and not by going to a place of worship, not by repeating
   prayers, not by joining a church, not by being baptized, not by taking
   the sacrament, knows more than many; and he who also knows that loving
   God with all his heart is an absolutely needful evidence of his being a
   child of God, and longs to feel that love, is not far from the kingdom.
   A sense of the value and necessity of spiritual religion is a most
   hopeful sign. I do not say that it is a sure sign of saving grace; but
   I am sure it is a token of being very near the kingdom. Oh that the man
   would take the one step which is now needed by turning his knowledge
   into practice! Oh that he would believe with all his heart, and live!

   Another point is manifest in this man's confession; he saw very plainly
   the supremacy of God over the whole of our manhood. It was clear to him
   that there was but one God, and that man was made on purpose to be one
   and undivided in his service. He perceived that man should love, honor,
   and serve that one God with all his heart, with all his heart, with all
   his understanding, with all his soul, and with all his strength. Do you
   know that, dear friend? Come now, if you are not a saved man, I will
   ask you'do you recognize this to be true, that it is your bounden duty
   to serve your God with all your heart and understanding, and soul, and
   strength? Do you admit this? If you do, and if you are an honest man,
   you are not far from the kingdom of God, because honest men earnestly
   endeavor to pay their debts, and when they find that they cannot, they
   are distressed. If you are in distress of mind because you cannot meet
   your obligations to God, then you are not far from the kingdom. I
   rejoice in your discovery of shortcoming, failure, and inability, for
   these lie near that hearty penitence which is the sister of saving
   faith, and the sure herald of joy and peace. When a man feels his own
   inability to do as he ought, when he trembles before the law which,
   nevertheless, he honors and admits to be just and right, then he is not
   far from self-renunciation, and from accepting that matchless
   righteousness which Jesus Christ has come to bring. A consciousness of
   the supremacy of the sovereignty of God over us, so that he ought to
   have every thought, every breath, every pulse, is the work of the
   Spirit, who thereby convinces us of sin, and it is a sweet sign of dawn
   in the once darkened soul. Admit that God ought to be heartily loved,
   and you are not far from loving him; feel that you are guilty for not
   loving, and the seeds of love are in your heart.

   Once more only. Although this hopeful scribe recognized the value of
   spiritual religion, and the need of heart-work, and of the heart being
   wholly given to God, yet he did not despise outward religion so far as
   it was commanded of God. He says that to love God is better than whole
   burnt offerings and sacrifices; which was an admission that these
   things were good in their places. He was no rejecter of ceremonies
   which are commanded, because of the superstition of will-worshippers
   who invent ceremonies. We are not to give up the baptism of believers
   because of the unscriptural rite of infant sprinkling, nor to forsake
   the Lord's Supper because of the popish mass. Ordinances of God are
   good in their places, and what is to be dreaded is the perversion of
   them by thrusting them into the place of better and more important
   matters. Thus the scribe showed a well-balanced mind all round, and
   proved himself not far from the kingdom of God.

   My dear friend, are you prepared to lay hold of truth wherever you find
   it? Are you prepared to break away from party ties and family
   prejudices? Are you prepared to believe that the inward and spiritual
   part of religion is infinitely superior to the external part of it, be
   it right or be it wrong? Do you also admit the divine supremacy of God,
   and his right to you in all respects? And are you willing to take
   ordinances, such as he has ordained, in their place, and not out of it?
   Then, if all these things be in you, your character resembles that of
   this scribe of whom Jesus said, Thou art not far from the kingdom of
   God.' I am right glad to meet with you, for you are not far from
   submitting to the divine authority, since you are already found
   admitting its right to you. I trust you are not far from entering into
   the realm of spiritual religion, for you already value it. You are not
   far from the privilege of being wholly renewed in heart, since you see
   the need of it. How glad I am that you should be now listening to the
   gospel! Happier still shall I be if God shall help me to say the right
   word to you at this good hour. The Lord send it!

   II. Our second point is THE QUESTION SUGGESTED'this man came so near to
   the kingdom: did he ever enter it? We do not know. If anybody were to
   assert that he did not I should be ready to question his statement. If
   anybody were to declare that he did I should at once demand his
   authority for the assertion. We receive no information from the
   Scriptures, and it is always better where the word of God is silent to
   be silent ourselves. We should also observe another very good rule if
   you have to judge of a man's state, and know but little of it, always
   judge it favourably. Judges usually give a prisoner the benefit of the
   doubt; and when a man is not a prisoner, when he has come so far
   towards grace as this scribe, let us at any rate hope that he did enter
   into the kingdom.

   I see no reason why he should not have done so; and that is my first
   answer to the question. He should have done so. Having come so far
   there were many doors by which, God's Spirit being with him, he might
   have entered into the kingdom; I mean doors of thought, by which the
   Holy Spirit would readily have led his candid mind into the faith of
   Christ. I will show you one. There was in after years another scribe, a
   rabbi'you will recollect his name'who said, I consent unto the law,
   that it is good; but I see another law in my members, warring against
   the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin
   which is in my members. O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me
   from the body of this death? I thank God, through Jesus Christ our
   Lord.' You see the process of thought. It is a very simple one. This
   scribe sees the law of God to be a spiritual law, demanding the
   obedience of his heart, his understanding, his soul, and his strength.
   If he had thought awhile he would, as a candid man, have said, I have
   not kept this law. What is more, I cannot keep it. If I try to keep it
   I find a something within me against which I struggle, but which,
   nevertheless, brings me into captivity to another law'a law of
   selfishness, a law of sin.' Then, as a man anxious to be right, he
   would have said, How can I be delivered? Oh that I might be set free to
   keep the law of God! I cannot abide in this bondage. I ought to keep
   this law, I shall never be happy till I do love God with all my heart,
   for he ought to be so loved, and I perceive that there can be no heaven
   to a heart which does not love God intensely, for this is one of the
   essentials of peace and rest. How can I get at it?' In such a condition
   as that, if he had heard the sweet invitation of our Lord, Come unto
   me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest,'
   would he not have leaped at the sound? Do you not see the simple
   doorway for such a man as that to become a Christian? He had come so
   far that surely he should come a little farther. Let us trust that he
   did. At any rate, if any of you have come so far, may God's sweet
   Spirit lead you to take those other steps, and to enter into the
   kingdom, submitting to the sweet sovereignty of the Prince Immanuel,
   whose scepter is of silver, and whose servitude is an honor and a
   delight to all his subjects.

   That is one door; now follow with me another track. Suppose this man
   had really loved God with all his heart, and understanding, and soul,
   and strength'I will not say perfectly, for that would be supposing an
   impossibility, but supposing that he had truly and sincerely loved God,
   he could not have been an hour in the company of the Lord Jesus without
   feeling the deepest union of heart to him. Would he not have exclaimed,
   This man, too, loves God with all his heart'? He must have perceived
   it, for the zeal which Christ had for the Father was immeasurable; it
   flashed in every gleam of his eye, it tinctured every word that fell
   from his lips. Jesus lived for God, and glorified the Father with all
   his heart and soul, and any person who truly loved God would soon have
   perceived that fact. Ah!' he would have exclaimed, here is one who
   loves God better than I do; here is one who honors God more than I do;
   here is one who is more consecrated, more devoted, more godlike than I
   am.' By that door he would have been led to admiration of Jesus, to
   communion with him, and ultimately to belief in him as the Messiah. Let
   us hope that the scribe was so led, for the way is plain enough. At any
   rate, if God in his grace has led any man here to love the Father, I am
   persuaded that he will love the Son; for he that loveth him that begat,
   loveth him also that is begotten of him. My hearer, thou art certainly
   not far from the kingdom of God if thou hast come so far as to love
   God, even though thou knowest little as yet of his only begotten Son.
   God help you to take that one other step.

   Here is another door. You notice that he said that to love God was more
   than all burnt offerings and sacrifices. Now, suppose that with that in
   his mind, he had sat down, and said, This loving God is the main thing;
   why, then, is the law encumbered with burnt offerings and sacrifices?
   If they really are inferior to the moral precepts, and especially to
   the spiritual precepts, why are they there at all?' Then methinks he
   would have seen that they must be there for a spiritual purpose. And
   suppose he had begun to try and read the meaning of the paschal lamb,
   or of the daily lamb, or of the sin-offering, why, methinks, if he
   turned to that blessed fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, and began to read
   it in order to understand the sacrifices of the old law, it would have
   happened to him as it did to the eunuch when Philip opened to him the
   Scriptures'he would have seen Jesus in them all. He must have seen him.
   And if you, dear friend, have come to see the right place of gospel
   ordinances through candidly searching out their meaning, you have seen
   that their whole teaching is Christ Jesus, the sacrifice for sin. There
   is nothing in the two great gospel ordinances but Christ. Christ's
   sufferings, death, burial, and resurrection set forth in baptism:
   Christ's death set forth until he come at the communion table'life
   given us by our Savior's death, and life sustained by the same means.
   Jesus is the body of the ordinances of the Old Testament, and the soul
   of those of the New. If you are but candid enough to desire to push
   through the veil, and get at the real meaning of every outward
   ordinance, you will see Jesus ere long.

   There is another road by which the scribe might have been led to the
   Savior. Think again. Suppose that he had continued to glow and burn
   with love to God. As that love grew the understanding would also become
   enlightened with it, and the soul would rise towards God. You know why
   that would be. It must be because the Holy Spirit was in the man, for
   no man loveth God or striveth to love God, with all his heart, and
   understanding, and soul, and strength, without there being in secret
   and unknown to him a divine power at the back impelling him in that
   direction. Now, do you think that the Holy Spirit would thus work in
   the man and not reveal Christ to him for his salvation? I cannot
   believe it. I am persuaded that, coming as that man did under the
   gospel of Christ, he would be by his candour, by his love of God, by
   the influence of the divine Spirit, in such a state of mind that, as
   when sparks fall upon dry tinder they ignite at once, so would the
   words of Jesus fall upon a mind prepared of the Spirit of God. That
   scribe was, therefore, not far from the kingdom of God. I do hope that
   there are some such hearts present at this hour. Some of you, I trust,
   can say, Oh that I had Christ! I would give my eyes for him.' If you
   mean that, why do you not have him? He is to be had for nothing. Oh,'
   says another, I would die if I might have him and be saved.' Why not
   live, and be saved? Oh, but I would give anything.' Why not leave off
   the idea of giving, and take freely what Jesus presents to you? But yet
   that very desire of yours'that longing of yours'proves that you are not
   far from the kingdom of God. My heart's desire is that as you have come
   so far you may now yield yourselves up to Jesus. That is the way of
   salvation: have done with self-salvation and let Jesus save you. When a
   man is in the water, if he kicks and struggles he will drown, but if he
   lies still he will float. When another comes to help, if he will be
   passive he will be saved, but all that he can do will hinder his
   deliverance. Be passive in the hands of Christ till he gives you life
   to be active with. Be nothing, and let him be everything. Trust him
   wholly and alone. Drop into his arms, and let him bear the weight of
   your sins and sorrows, and it shall not be said of you any longer that
   you are not far from the kingdom of God, but it shall be sung on earth
   and in heaven'He has returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of souls,
   glory be to God!'

   Still, as I have said, there is the dark supposition that perhaps the
   scribe never did enter the kingdom. He may have been so near to the
   kingdom, and yet he may have lacked the one thing needful. If it were
   so, it was a grievous fact; and all we can now do is to profit by it.
   What could have been the reason why he did not enter the kingdom? I
   cannot tell, we know so little of him; but if we might infer from the
   little we do know, I should suppose that if he did not enter it was
   from the unworthy motive of being swayed by his fellow-men. We judged
   that when he came to Christ to put the question, he came not of his own
   mind and motion. We began by thinking that he seemed half-hearted in
   his opposition, and that so he the more readily turned from a
   questioner into a candid admirer. It is, however, just possible that,
   being the spokesman for others, he had grown fond of taking the lead;
   and if he did not really enter the kingdom, it may have been because he
   would have lost his place in the front rank of scribe and pharisee, and
   this was too great a price to pay for truth and righteousness. I have
   known a man deeply impressed with religious things, and feeling his way
   aright; but a little company of half a dozen whom he met in the
   evening, of whom he was the leading spirit, have sufficed to hold him
   in bondage. They invite him to come again; they miss his genial
   society, his jest, his song, his merry talk. He cannot face it out, and
   tell them that he has a call elsewhere, a call to nobler things. He has
   not the resolute will to lead them in another direction, and dreads
   even to make the attempt. He wants to be the leading man; and so he
   gives up what his conscience suggests to him rather than not be the
   leader of men whom in his heart he must know to be unworthy of such a
   homage. In his own mind he thinks them fools; but, still, he is afraid
   that they should think him so, and therefore he becomes a greater and
   more guilty fool than they. Oh. that fear of men, that fear of men! You
   may meet with here and there a man of the better sort who begins to
   feel, Yes, there is the light there: light worth having.' He breaks
   away from his party, and its surroundings, and for a while is eager for
   the truth, which he has half discovered; but he fears the cold shoulder
   which society would give him, dreads the jeer of Sir John,' and the
   sneer of My Lord.' The half-opened eye is closed with saddest
   determination from fear ot other children of darkness, who would mock
   at its better sight. This is a sight which might make an angel weep.
   Jesus is sold, but not for so much as clinked in the hand of Judas; he
   is bartered for a fool's smile, and for the company of the vain and
   frivolous. Ah me, that ever the sun should behold so dread a sight!
   Multitudes who know the truth, and are not far from the kingdom of God,
   nevertheless, never enter it, because of the fear of man, the love of
   approbation, the horror of being laughed at and jested at. With such
   vile fetters immortal souls are bound for execution, and held back from
   everlasting blessedness. There is something very beautiful about many a
   young man of enquiring mind, and if you could transplant him, and set
   him in another soil, you might make something of him; but not in that
   shop, where all his fellows would make him the butt of their mirth if
   he were really a Christian, not in that work-room, where all the
   artisans would swear and chaff if he were but to avow his half-formed
   convictions. Want of courage, want of self-denial, is that fatal flaw
   which ruins what else had been a gem in the Redeemer's crown. All brave
   hearts mournfully pronounce that he is justly lost who is not bold
   enough to own his Savior, and the truth.

   I had as lief not be, as live to be

   In awe of such a thing as I myself.'

   Afraid of another man! Am I then myself a man? Or am I but the mere
   mockery of manhood? Oh, sirs, let your manhood come to the rescue. God
   grant you grace to say, What can it matter to me what men say as long
   as I am right?' They cannot break bones with their jests; and if they
   did, there have been Christians who have not only suffered the breaking
   of their bones, but the burning of their whole bodies for Christ's sake
   sooner than deny his sacred claims. What did Jesus say? He that loseth
   his life for my sake shall find it.' He who, to gain the whole world,
   would keep back a solitary truth, is a huge loser for his pains. He is
   mean and base, and not worthy to be numbered amongst those who follow
   the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. Oh! if I speak to one who hesitates,
   let me remind him that, however it may look to-night to be a daring
   step to be decided for Christ, it will look very differently soon when
   the great trumpet shall sound, and ring o'er earth and sea, and the
   dead shall rise, and the judgment-seat shall be set, and the great
   white throne shall be unveiled. Then it will be seen to be a far more
   desperate daring to deny the Lord even to save life itself. What will
   the cowards do in that day who, to please men, forsook their Lord? What
   will they do who suppressed truth and stifled conscience when the
   Shepherd begins to divide the goats and the sheep from each other? Ay,
   what will they do who find themselves driven with the goats, though
   once they half decided to be numbered with the sheep? They were near
   the fold, but never entered. What will they feel when he shall say,
   Depart! Depart! I know you not. You knew not me in the day of my
   humiliation. You were ashamed of me in the world. You blushed at. my
   name. You covered up what was in your conscience in order to avoid
   man's laughter and rebuke. You knew not me, and now I know not you.
   Depart! Depart!' In proportion to the light against which you have shut
   your eyes will be your horror when that light shall blind you into
   eternal night. In proportion to the violence which you have done to
   your consciences will be the terror which your awakened consciences
   will work in you. In proportion to the nearness of the kingdom within
   which you came shall be the dreadful distance to which you will be
   driven.

   I was thinking that, if the Lord were to pay men in their own coin,
   what an awful thing it would be if those who are now not far from the
   kingdom were told by the Lord, You shall stay there for ever. You, who
   heard the gospel, and did not accept it, must stop where you are.'
   Halt, sir! not a step more! Close to the gates of heaven'you stop
   there! To hear its music for ever, and to gnash your teeth for ever,
   because you cannot join in it! To hear the songs of the righteous,
   while you wail for ever! To know the brightness of bliss, but to be
   yourself in the black darkness for ever! To be within an inch of
   heaven, and yet in hell! The living water flowing at your feet, and yet
   your tongue for ever parched! The bread of life nigh at hand, and yet
   you cannot eat! Oh, think of it! Eternally not far from the kingdom! If
   you would not wish to be so, oh, be not out of Christ another minute!
   May God's Spirit enable you to leap right away from your undecided
   condition into living faith and loving obedience to Christ.

   So near to the Kingdom! yet what dost thou lack?

   So near to the Kingdom! what keepeth thee back?

   Renounce every idol, tho' dear it may be,

   And come to the Savior now pleading with thee.'

  LETTER FROM MR. SPURGEON.

   DEAR FRIENDS,'Nothing remains to report to you but my hope of being in
   my own pulpit on Feb. 8. I beg you to join with me in thanks to the
   healing Lord for this restoration. The Lord bringeth down to the grave
   and raiseth up again, and to him be praise for ever.

   It would be a great favor to me personally, and a means of good to
   many, if the readers of the sermons would aid in increasing their
   circulation. They are already very widely scattered, but if twice the
   number could be sent abroad we might look for double fruit. After
   standing the test of twenty-five years the Metropolitan Tabernacle
   Pulpit may be pardoned if it asks those who profit by the sermons to
   introduce them to others.

   May future discourses be more full of unction and power, and so may
   you, dear readers, reap a harvest from my pains and sicknesses.

   Yours ever heartily,

   C.H. Spurgeon

   Menton, January 22, 1879.

                           Beloved, and yet Afflicted

   Notes of a Sermon

   (No. 1518)

   PREACHED BEFORE AN AUDIENCE OF INVALID LADIES AT MENTONE, BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   Lord, behold, he whom Thou lovest is sick.'John 11:3.

   THAT DISCIPLE WHOM JESUS LOVED is not at all backward to record that
   Jesus loved Lazarus too: there are no jealousies among those who are
   chosen by the Well-beloved. Jesus loved Mary, and Martha, and Lazarus:
   it is a happy thing where a whole family live in the love of Jesus.
   They were a favoured trio, and yet, as the serpent came into Paradise,
   so did sorrow enter their quiet household at Bethany. Lazarus was sick.
   They all felt that if Jesus were there disease would flee at his
   presence; what then should they do but let him know of their trial?
   Lazarus was near to death's door, and so his tender sisters at once
   reported the fact to Jesus, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest
   is sick.' Many a time since then has that same message been sent to our
   Lord, for in full many a case he has chosen his people in the furnace
   of affliction. Of the Master it is said, himself took our infirmities,
   and bare our sicknesses,' and it is, therefore, no extraordinary thing
   for the members to be in this matter conformed to their Head.

   I. Notice, first, A FACT mentioned in the text: Lord, behold, he whom
   thou lovest is sick.' The sisters were somewhat astonished that it
   should be so, for the word behold' implies a measure of surprise. We
   love him, and would make him well directly: thou lovest him, and yet he
   remains sick. Thou canst heal him with a word, why then is thy loved
   one sick?' Have not you, dear sick friend, often wondered how your
   painful or lingering disease could be consistent with your being
   chosen, and called, and made one with Christ? I dare say this has
   greatly perplexed you, and yet in very truth it is by no means strange,
   but a thing to be expected.

   We need not be astonished that the man whom the Lord loves is sick, for
   he is only a man. The love of Jesus does not separate us from the
   common necessities and infirmities of human life. Men of God are still
   men. The covenant of grace is not a charter of exemption from
   consumption, or rheumatism, or asthma. The bodily ills, which come upon
   us because of our flesh, will attend us to the tomb, for Paul saith, we
   that are in this body do groan.'

   Those whom the Lord loves are the more likely to be sick, since they
   are under a peculiar discipline. It is written, Whom the Lord loveth he
   chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.' Affliction of
   some sort is one of the marks of the true-born child of God, and it
   frequently happens that the trial takes the form of illness. Shall we
   therefore wonder that we have to take our turn in the sick chamber? If
   Job, and David, and Hezekiah must each one smart, who are we that we
   should be amazed because we are in ill-health?

   Nor is it remarkable that we are sick if we reflect upon the great
   benefit which often flows from it to ourselves. I do not know what
   peculiar improvement may have been wrought in Lazarus, but many a
   disciple of Jesus would have been of small use if he had not been
   afflicted. Strong men are apt to be harsh, imperious, and
   unsympathetic, and therefore they need to be put into the furnace, and
   melted down. I have known Christian women who would never have been so
   gentle, tender, wise, experienced, and holy if they had not been
   mellowed by physical pain. There are fruits in God's garden as well as
   in man's which never ripen till they are bruised. Young women who are
   apt to be volatile, conceited, or talkative, are often trained to be
   full of sweetness and light by sickness after sickness, by which they
   are taught to sit at Jesus' feet. Many have been able to say with the
   psalmist, It is good for me to have been afflicted, that I might learn
   thy statutes.' For this reason even such as are highly favoured and
   blessed among women may feel a sword piercing through their hearts.

   Oftentimes this sickness of the Lord's loved ones is for the good of
   others. Lazarus was permitted to be sick and to die, that by his death
   and resurrection the apostles might be benefited. His sickness was for
   the glory of God.' Throughout these nineteen hundred years which have
   succeeded Lazarus' sickness all believers have been getting good out of
   it, and this afternoon we are all the better because he languished and
   died. The church and the world may derive immense advantage through the
   sorrows of good men: the careless may be awakened, the doubting may be
   convinced, the ungodly may be converted, the mourner may be comforted
   through our testimony in sickness; and if so, would we wish to avoid
   pain and weakness? Are we not quite willing that our friends should say
   of us also Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick'?

   II. Our text, however, not only records a fact, but mentions A REPORT
   of that fact: the sisters sent and told Jesus. Let us keep up a
   constant correspondence with our Lord about everything.

   Sing a hymn to Jesus, when thy heart is faint;

   Tell it all to Jesus, comfort or complaint.'

   Jesus knows all about us, but it is a great relief to pour out our
   hearts before him. When John the Baptist's broken-hearted disciples saw
   their leader beheaded, they took up the body, and went and told Jesus.'
   They could not have done better. In all trouble send a message to
   Jesus, and do not keep your misery to yourself. In his case there is no
   need of reserve, there is no fear of his treating you with cold pride,
   or heartless indifference, or cruel treachery. He is a confident who
   never can betray us, a friend who never will refuse us.

   There is this fair hope about telling Jesus, that he is sure to support
   us under it. If you go to Jesus, and ask, Most gracious Lord, why am I
   sick? I thought I was useful while in health, and now I can do nothing;
   why is this?' He may be pleased to show you why, or, if not, he will
   make you willing to bear his will with patience without knowing why. He
   can bring his truth to your mind to cheer you, or strengthen your heart
   by his presence, or send you unexpected comforts, and give you to glory
   in your afflictions. Ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is
   a refuge for us.' Not in vain did Mary and Martha send to tell Jesus,
   and not in vain do any seek his face.

   Remember, too, that Jesus may give healing. It would not be wise to
   live by a supposed faith, and cast off the physician and his medicines,
   any more than to discharge the butcher, and the tailor, and expect to
   be fed and clothed by faith; but this would be far better than
   forgetting the Lord altogether, and trusting to man only. Healing for
   both body and soul must be sought from God. We make use of medicines,
   but these can do nothing apart from the Lord, who healeth all our
   diseases.' We may tell Jesus about our aches and pains, and gradual
   declinings, and hacking coughs. Some persons are afraid to go to God
   about their health: they pray for the pardon of sin, but dare not ask
   the Lord to remove a headache: and, yet, surely, if the hairs outside
   our head are all numbered by God it is not much more of a condescension
   for him to relieve throbs and pressures inside the head. Our big things
   must be very little to the great God, and our little things cannot be
   much less. It is a proof of the greatness of the mind of God that while
   ruling the heavens and the earth, he is not so absorbed by these great
   concerns as to be forgetful of the least pain or want of any one of his
   poor children. We may go to him about our failing breath, for he first
   gave us lungs and life. We may tell him about the eye which grows dim,
   and the ear which loses hearing, for he made them both. We may mention
   the swollen knee, and the gathering finger, the stiff neck, and the
   sprained foot, for he made all these our members, redeemed them all,
   and will raise them all from the grave. Go at once, and say, Lord,
   behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.'

   III. Thirdly, let us notice in the case of Lazarus A RESULT which we
   should not have expected. No doubt when Mary and Martha sent to tell
   Jesus they looked to see Lazarus recover as soon as the messenger
   reached the Master; but they were not gratified. For two days the Lord
   remained in the same place, and not till he knew that Lazarus was dead
   did he speak of going to Judea. This teaches us that Jesus may be
   informed of our trouble, and yet may act as if he were indifferent to
   it. We must not expect in every case that prayer for recovery will be
   answered, for if so, nobody would die who had chick or child, friend or
   acquaintance to pray for him. In our prayers for the lives of beloved
   children of God we must not forget that there is one prayer which may
   be crossing ours, for Jesus prays, Father, I will that they also, whom
   thou hast given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my
   glory.' We pray that they may remain with us, but when we recognize
   that Jesus wants them above, what can we do but admit his larger claim
   and say, Not as I will, but as thou wilt'? In our own case, we may pray
   the Lord to raise us up, and yet though he loves us he may permit us to
   grow worse and worse, and at last to die. Hezekiah had fifteen years
   added to his life, but we may not gain the reprieve of a single day.
   Never set such store by the life of any one dear to you, or even by
   your own life, as to be rebellious against the Lord. If you hold the
   life of any dear one with too tight a hand, you are making a rod for
   your own back; and if you love your own earthly life too well, you are
   making a thorny pillow for your dying bed. Children are often idols,
   and in such cases their too ardent lovers are idolaters. We might as
   well make a god of clay, and worship it, as the Hindus are said to do,
   as worship our fellow-creatures, for what are they but clay? Shall dust
   be so dear to us that we quarrel with our God about it? If our Lord
   leaves us to suffer, let us not repine. He must do that for us which is
   kindest and best, for he loves us better than we love ourselves.

   Did I hear you say, Yes, Jesus allowed Lazarus to die, but he raised
   him up again'? I answer, he is the resurrection and the life to us
   also. Be comforted concerning the departed, Thy brother shall rise
   again,' and all of us whose hope is in Jesus shall partake in our
   Lord's resurrection. Not only shall our souls live, but our bodies,
   too, shall be raised incorruptible. The grave will serve as a refining
   pot, and this vile body shall come forth vile no longer. Some
   Christians are greatly cheered by the thought of living till the Lord
   comes, and so escaping death. I confess that I think this no great
   gain, for so far from having any preference over them that are asleep,
   those who are alive and remain at his coming will miss one point of
   fellowship, in not dying and rising like their Lord. Beloved, all
   things are yours, and death is expressly mentioned in the list,
   therefore do not dread it, but rather long for evening to undress, that
   you may rest with God.'

   IV. I will close with A QUESTION'Jesus loved Martha, and her sister,
   and Lazarus'does Jesus in a special sense love you? Alas, many sick
   ones have no evidence of any special love of Jesus towards them, for
   they have never sought his face, nor trusted in him. Jesus might say to
   them I never knew you,' for they have turned their backs upon his blood
   and his cross. Answer, dear friend, to your own heart this question, Do
   you love Jesus?' If so, you love him because he first loved you. Are
   you trusting him? If so, that faith of yours is the proof that he has
   loved you from before the foundation of the world, for faith is the
   token by which he plights his troth to his beloved.

   If Jesus loves you, and you are sick, let all the world see how you
   glorify God in your sickness. Let friends and nurses see how the
   beloved of the Lord are cheered and comforted by him. Let your holy
   resignation astonish them, and set them admiring your Beloved, who is
   so gracious to you that he makes you happy in pain, and joyful at the
   gates of the grave. If your religion is worth anything it ought to
   support you now, and it will compel unbelievers to see that he whom the
   Lord loveth is in better case when he is sick than the ungodly when
   full of health and vigour.

   If you do not know that Jesus loves you, you lack the brightest star
   that can cheer the night of sickness. I hope you will not die as you
   now are, and pass into another world without enjoying the love of
   Jesus: that would be a terrible calamity indeed. Seek his face at once,
   and it may be that your present sickness is a part of the way of love
   by which Jesus would bring you to himself. Lord, heal all these sick
   ones in soul and in body. Amen.

At School

   (No. 1519)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Teach me to do Your will; for You are my God." Psalm 143:10.

   THIS is a prayer about doing, but it is perfectly free from legal
   taint. The man who offered it had no idea of being saved by his doings,
   for in the second verse of the Psalm he had said, "Enter not into
   judgment with Your servant: for in Your sight shall no man living be
   justified." This is not the prayer of a sinner seeking salvation, for
   salvation is not by doing the will of God but by believing in Christ.
   It is the prayer of the man who is already saved and who, being saved,
   devotes himself to the service of God and wishes to be taught in the
   fear of the Lord. "Teach me to do Your will, O God." The connection
   leads us to make the remark that David looked upon the doing of God's
   will as his best escape from his enemies.

   He speaks of his cruel persecutors. He declares that though he looked
   all around he could find none who would help him. Then he prays, "Teach
   me to do Your will; for You are my God." And depend upon it, the surest
   way to escape from harm is to do no ill. If you are surrounded by those
   who would slander you, your best defense is a blameless life! If many
   are watching for your halting and maliciously desiring your fall, your
   safety lies in holiness! The very best prayer you can pray for your own
   protection is, "Teach me to do Your will." If you do right, none can
   harm you. This prayer was suggested by the perplexity of the Psalmist's
   mind. He was overwhelmed and did not know what to do and, therefore, he
   cried, "Teach me to do Your will, O God,"

   He had come to a place where many roads met and he did not know which
   path to take and so he prayed God to guide him in the way appointed. I
   commend this prayer to all who may be sorely puzzled and anxious. You
   have exercised your own judgment and you have, perhaps, consulted too
   much with friends and yet your way seems entirely blocked up--resort to
   God with this as your heart's prayer, "Teach me to do Your will; for
   You are my God." May the Spirit of God now bless us while we open up
   this short prayer that we may be helped to understand it and use it.
   First, we will speak upon the prayer. And then, secondly, upon its
   answer.

   I. And, first, THE PRAYER ITSELF--let us notice its character. It is a
   holy prayer. "Teach me to do Your will." The man who utters this
   language desires to be free from sin, for sin can never be God's will.
   Under no circumstances, whatever, may I do wrong and fancy that I am
   doing God's will! I have read of an extremely poor man who needed fuel
   for the fire for his children and the text came to his mind, "All
   things are yours." Armed with this text, he thought he would take a
   little wood from his neighbor's woodpile but, very happily there came
   to his mind another text, "You shall not steal." He was quite clear
   about its meaning and so he left the wood alone. And he remembered,
   afterward, how that text had saved him from a great transgression.

   Depend upon it, whatever circumstances or impressions may seem to say,
   it is never God's will that you should do wrong! There are devil's
   Providences as well as God's Providences. When Jonah wanted to go to
   Tarshish, he found a ship going there and I dare say he said, "How
   Providential!" Yes, but no Providence can ever be an excuse for sinning
   against God! We are to do right and, therefore, we pray, "Teach me to
   do Your will." It is a humble prayer--the prayer of a man of deep
   experience and yet, for all that and, perhaps, because of that, a man
   who felt that he needed teaching as to every step he should take. When
   you do not need teaching, Brothers and Sisters, it is because you are
   too stupid to learn--you may depend upon that.

   It is only a very young lady fresh from a boarding school who has
   "finished her education." And it is only a great fool of a man who
   thinks that he can learn no more. Those who know themselves best and
   know the world best and know God best always have the lowest thoughts
   of themselves. They have no wisdom of their own except this--that they
   are wise enough to flee from their own wisdom and say to the Lord,
   "Teach me to do Your will." This is a holy prayer and a humble prayer
   and commends itself to every holy and humble heart.

   It is, dear Friends, a docile prayer--the prayer of a teachable man.
   "Teach me to do Your will." It is not merely, you see, "Teach me your
   will," but, "Teach me to do it." The person is so ignorant that he
   needs to be taught how to do anything and everything. You may tell a
   child how to walk, but it will not walk, for all that! You must teach
   it to walk. You must take it by the arms as God did Ephraim. He says,
   "I taught Ephraim, also, to go, taking them by their arms," just as a
   nurse teaches her little ones. "Teach me to do." Lord, it is not enough
   that You teach my head and teach my heart, but teach my hands and my
   feet. "Teach me to do Your will."

   Such a suppliant is docile and ready to learn. It is an acquiescent
   prayer, also, which is a great thing in its favor. "Teach me to do Your
   will--not mine. I will put my will to the side." He does not say,
   "Lord, teach me to do part of Your will--that part which pleases me,"
   but all Your will. If there is any part of Your will which I am not
   pleased with, for that very reason teach it to me until my whole soul
   shall be conformed to Your mind and I shall love Your will, not because
   it happens to be pleasing, but because it is Your will. It is a prayer
   of resignation and self-abnegation and is, perhaps, one of the highest
   that the Christian can pray, though it may well befit the learner who
   stands for the first time at Wisdom's door.

   And then notice that it is a believing prayer--"Teach me to do Your
   will; for You are my God." There is faith in God in this claim. "You
   are my God"--and there is faith in God's condescension that He will act
   as a Teacher. Brothers and Sisters, we have two faults. We do not think
   God to be as great as He is and we do not think God can be so little as
   He can be. We err on both sides and neither know His height of Glory
   nor His depth of Grace. We practically say, "This trial is too menial.
   I will bear it without Him." We forget that the same God who rules the
   stars condescends to be a Teacher and teaches us to do His will! We
   heard, once, of a president of a great nation who, nevertheless, taught
   in a Sunday school--it was thought to be great condescension--but what
   shall I say of Him who, while He sits amid the choirs of angels and
   accepts their praises, comes down to His little children and teaches
   them to do His will? The prayer before us is very precious, for it is
   holy, humble, docile, acquiescent and believing.

   Let us now notice what the actual request is. In so many words it says,
   "Teach me to do Your will." So, Brothers and Sisters, it is a practical
   prayer. He does not say merely, "Teach me to know Your will"--a very
   excellent prayer, that-- but there are a great many who stick fast in
   the knowing and do not go on to the doing! These are forgetful hearers
   deceiving themselves. An ounce of doing is worth a ton of knowing! The
   most orthodox faith in the world, if it is accompanied by an unholy
   life, will only increase a man's damnation. There must be the yielding
   up of the members and of the mind unto God in obedience, or else the
   more we know, the greater will be our condemnation!

   The Psalmist does not say, "Lord, help me to talk about Your will,"
   though it is a very proper thing to talk about and a very profitable
   thing to hear about. But still doing is better than talking. If t's
   were w's there would be more saints in the world than there are. That
   is to say, if those who talk uprightly would also walk uprightly, it
   would be well. But with many, the talk is better than the walk. Better
   a silent tongue than an unclean life! Practical godliness is preferable
   to the sweetest eloquence. The prayer is, "Teach me to do Your will."

   There are some who long to be taught in all mysteries and, truly, to
   understand a mystery aright is a great privilege, but their main
   thought seems to be to know the deep doctrines, the mysterious points.
   Many go into prophecy and a nice muddle they make when they get there.
   We have had I do not know how many theories of prophecy, each one of
   them more absurd than the rest and so it will be, I fear, to the
   world's end. Truly, it would be a good thing to understand the
   prophecies and all knowledge, "and yet show I unto you a more excellent
   way"--and that excellent way is to live a life of humble, godly
   dependence and faith and to show forth in your life the love that was
   in Christ Jesus! Lord, I chiefly long to know Your will to do it--teach
   me that and I am content.

   I have already said that this prayer asks that we may do God's will,
   not our own. Oh, how naturally our heart prays, "Lord, let me have my
   own way." That is the first prayer of human nature when it is left
   alone--"Who is the Lord that I should obey His voice? Let me have my
   own way!" That desire will sometimes enter the Christian's heart,
   though I hope it will not long remain there! We may be praying, "Lord,
   not my will, but Yours be done," and yet the wicked, rebellious heart
   may be saying inside, "But let it be my will, Lord! Let it be my will."
   Still do we cling to self! May the Lord deliver us from Lord
   Will-He-Will who is a terrible tyrant wherever he rules! And may this
   be our prayer, "Teach me to do Your will."

   We are not to ask to do other people's will, though some persons are
   always slaves to the wills of others. Whatever their company is, that
   is what they are. In Rome they do as Rome does--they try to accommodate
   themselves to their family--they cannot take a stand, or be decided.
   They are ruled and governed, poor slaves that they are, by their
   connections. They fear the frown of man! Oh that they would rise to
   something nobler and pray, "Lord, teach me to do Your will, whether it
   is the will of the great ones of the earth, or the will of my
   influential friends, or the will of my loud talking neighbors or not!
   Help me to do Your will, to take my stand and say, 'As for me and my
   house, we will serve the

   Lord.'"

   It is a blessed prayer. The more we look at it the more we see in it.
   What does he mean by doing God's will? Does he not mean, "Help me to do
   as Your Word bids me"? For the will of God is put before us very
   plainly in His Law and, especially, in that Law as viewed in the hands
   of Christ. "This is the will of God, even our sanctification." To serve
   Him devoutly and to love our neighbor as ourselves--this is the will of
   God. May His Spirit help us. "Teach me to do Your will, O God." That
   will also takes the form of Providence. Out of two courses equally
   right, we sometimes have to ask the question, "Lord, what is Your will
   here?" There is nothing immoral in either the one or the other and,
   therefore, our difficulty. And so we go to the Lord and say, "Here is a
   case in which Your Law does not guide me, otherwise I should decide at
   once, but will You now show me what You will have me to do?"

   In another case the will of God may be suggested by opportunity. Dear
   Friend, the will of God is that you should speak to that friend sitting
   near you about soul matters. The will of God is that your unconverted
   servant should have your prayers and your instruction. God puts men in
   our way on purpose that we may do them good. I have no doubt whatever
   that many a Christian is made to go where he would not choose to go and
   to associate with persons that he would not wish to associate with on
   purpose--that he may be the means of taking light into dark places and
   of carrying life from God to dead souls. So if you pray this prayer,
   "Teach me to do Your will," and carry it out, you will watch for
   opportunities of serving the Lord.

   The prayer seems, to me, to have all that compass and much more. But I
   would answer another enquiry. What is the intention of the prayer as to
   manner? It does not say, "Lord, enable me to do Your will," but, "Teach
   me to do Your will," as if there were some peculiar way of doing it
   that had to be taught. As when a young man goes apprentice to acquire a
   trade. Lord, I would put myself under indenture to Your Grace that You
   may teach me the art and mystery of doing Your will. How, then, ought
   God's will to be done? It should be done thoughtfully. A great many
   Christians are not half as considerate as they should be. We should go
   through life not flippantly like the butterfly that flits from flower
   to flower, but like the bee that stays and sucks honey and gathers
   sweet store for the hive.

   We should be seriously in earnest and one point of earnestness should
   be--

   "With holy trembling, holy fear, To make my calling sure, Your utmost
   counsel to fulfill, And suffer all Your righteous will, And to the end
   endure."

   Lord, help me to do Your will, seriously bending all my soul to the
   doing of it, not trifling in Your courts, nor making life a play, but
   loving You with all my understanding! The Lord's will should be done
   immediately. As soon as a command is known, it should be obeyed. Lord,
   suffer me not to consult with flesh and blood. Make me prompt and quick
   of understanding in the fear of God. Teach me to do Your will as angels
   do, who no sooner hear Your word than they fly like flames of fire to
   fulfill Your wishes!

   His will should by done cheerfully. Jehovah seeks not slaves to grace
   His Throne. He would have us delight to do His will, yes, His Law
   should be in our heart. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, you need to pray
   this--"Teach me to do Your will," or else you will miss the mark. Teach
   me to do it constantly. Let me not sometimes be Your servant and then
   run away from You. Keep me to it. Let me never weary. When the morning
   wakes me, may it find me ready and when the evening bids me rest, may I
   be serving You until I fall asleep. Teach me to do it also, Lord,
   universally, not some part of it, but all of it--not one of Your
   commands being neglected--nor one single part of my daily task being
   left undone. I am Your servant.

   Make me to be what a good servant is to her mistress, neglecting none
   of the cares of the household. May I be watchful in all points. Teach
   me to do Your will spiritually, not making the outside of cups and
   platters clean, but obeying

   You within my soul. May what I do be done with all my heart. If I pray,
   help me to pray in the Spirit. If I sing, let my heart make music unto
   You. When I am talking to others about Your name and trying to spread
   the savor of Jesus, let me not do it in my own strength, or in a wrong
   spirit, but may the Holy Spirit be upon me. Teach me to do Your will
   intensely. Let the zeal of Your house eat me up. Oh that I might throw
   my whole self into it! This little prayer grows, does it not? Pray it,
   Brothers and Sisters and may the Lord answer you.

   Once again, there are necessary qualities which we must seek if we
   would sincerely pray this prayer, "Teach me to do Your will." You must
   have decision of character, for some never do God's will though they
   wish they did and they regret, they say, that they cannot--they resolve
   that they will and there it ends. O you spongy souls! Some of you are
   sadly squeezable! Whatever hand grips you can shape you. Decision is
   needed, for you cannot do God's will unless you know how to say, "No,"
   and to put your foot down and declare that whatever may happen, you
   will not turn aside from the service of your God! If the Lord shall
   teach you to do His will, you will also need courage. The prayer
   virtually says, "When my enemies ridicule me, teach me to do Your will.
   When they threaten me, teach me to do Your will. When they tempt me,
   teach me to do Your will. When they slander me, teach me to do Your
   will--to be brave with the bravery which resolves to do the right and
   leaves the issues with God." "Teach me to do Your will."

   It means--Give me resignation, kill in me my self-hood. Put down, I
   pray You, my pride. Make me willing to be anything or to do anything
   You will. It is a prayer that necessitates humility. No man can pray it
   unless he is willing to stoop and wash the saints' feet. "Teach me to
   do Your will." Let me be a dishwasher in Your kitchen if so I may
   glorify You. I have no choice but that You be All in All. It is a
   prayer, too, for spiritual life and much of it, for a dead man cannot
   do God's will. Shall the dead praise Him? Shall they that go down to
   the Pit give Him thanks? Oh, no, Brothers and Sisters! You must be full
   of life if you are to do God's will!

   Some professors are not quickened one-third of the way yet. I hope they
   have a measure of quickening, but it does not seem to have reached the
   extremities. There may be a little quickening in the heart, but it has
   not quickened the tongue to confess Christ, nor quickened the hands to
   give to Christ, or to work for Christ. They seem to be half-dead. O
   Lord, fill me with life from the sole of my feet to the crown of my
   head, for how can I do Your will unless Your Spirit saturates me
   through and through, till every pulse is consecrated? I would be wholly
   Yours. "Teach me to do Your will."

   II. I will not detain you many minutes over the second part of our
   sermon in which we are to say a little upon ITS ANSWER. There is the
   prayer, "Teach me to do Your will." Will it get an answer? Yes,
   Brothers and Sisters, it will assuredly obtain an answer of peace. For,
   first, there is a reason for expecting it. "You are my God." Oh, yes,
   if we were asking this of someone else, we might fear, but, "You are my
   God" is a blessed argument because the greater supposes the less! If
   God has given us Himself, He will give us teaching!

   It is also God's way to teach--"Good and upright is the Lord, therefore
   will He teach transgressors in the way." It is a quality of a good man
   to wish to make others good. It is supremely the quality of the good
   God to make others good. When I think of what the Lord is, I am certain
   that He will be willing to teach me to do His will. Moreover, He has
   promised to do it. "I will instruct you and teach you in the way that
   you shall go. I will guide you with My eyes." And, again, He is
   glorified by so doing, for it brings Glory to God when His people do
   His will. Therefore I may expect, for all these reasons, that He will
   teach me to do His will.

   Again, dear Friends, it needs to be answered. "Teach me to do Your
   will. Lord, there is nobody who can ever teach me Your will unless You
   do it. I shall never learn it by myself. This scholarship I shall never
   pick up by chance. Lord, unless You hold me fast and teach me with Your
   supreme art, I shall never learn to do Your will as I desire to learn
   it." You see, he turns away from every other teacher to his God. He
   puts himself to school with God alone. And there is the prayer, "Teach
   me to do Your will; for You are my God." Brothers and Sisters, you must
   have this teaching, or else you will never do God's will. No strength
   of nature, no wit of nature can ever suffice to serve the Lord
   aright--you must be taught from above!

   There are many ways in which God gives His answer to this prayer,
   "Teach me to do Your will." We have received one wonderful answer to it
   already. He has given Jesus Christ to be our Example. There is no
   teaching like actual example! If you want to know the will of God,
   study the life of Christ! The Lord is pleased to give us fainter copies
   of that same will of His in His saints. Read the sacred biographies of
   the Scriptures. Watch the holy lives of those who are among you, who
   live near to God, and follow them so far as they follow Christ. They
   are not complete copies--there are blots

   and blunders--still, the Lord does teach young people by the godly
   lives of their parents and He instructs all of us by the biographies of
   devoted men and women.

   Again, the Lord teaches us by every line of His Word and oftentimes
   when that Word is heard, or carefully read, it comes home with great
   power to the soul and guides us in the way of life. Moreover the Lord
   has a way of teaching us by His own Spirit. The Holy Spirit speaks in
   secret whispers to those who are able to hear Him. It is not every
   professing Christian that has the visitations of the Spirit of God in
   personal monitions, but there are saints who hear a voice behind them
   saying, "This is the way, walk in it." God guides us with His eyes as
   well as by His Word. Opened eyes can see, in a moment, what the Lord
   means. He has gentle means. His daily dealings in loving tenderness are
   guides to us. Every mercy is a star to pilot us to Heaven.

   When we are not willing to be guided so easily, He will teach us by
   rough means. The Lord has a bit and a whip for those who need them. He
   will restrain us by affliction and infirmity and sometimes chasten us
   very sorely with losses, bereavements, depression of spirit and the
   like--in some way or other He will hear the prayer for teaching, for it
   is a Covenant promise--"All your children shall be taught of the Lord."
   Blessed are they to whom the teaching comes sweetly and softly! It can
   be so if we are willing to have it so, but surely if we will not be
   tenderly guided, God will make us do His will as men compel the bullock
   to do their will when it is rebellions under the yoke and must be
   broken in. The Lord will hear our prayer for instruction, but it may
   not be quite in the way we would have chosen.

   One thing more. I trust we have, all of us who know the Lord, prayed
   the prayer, "Teach me to do Your will; for You are my God." Now mind,
   my dear Friends, mind that you do it sincerely and know what you are
   doing because after offering such a petition as this, you dare not go
   into sin! You cannot say, "Teach me to do Your will," and then go off
   to frivolous amusements, or spend your evenings in vain and giddy
   society. That would be an insolent mockery of God! "Teach me to do Your
   will," you say, and then get up and do what you know to be clean
   contrary to His mind and will--what defiant profanity is this! Again,
   do not offer this prayer with a reserve. Do not say, or mean, "Teach me
   to do Your will in all points but one. There is a point in which I pray
   You have me excused."

   I am afraid that certain Believers do not want to learn too much. I
   have known them not like to read special passages of Scripture. Perhaps
   they trouble them doctrinally, or as to the ordinances of the Christian
   faith, or as to matters of Church discipline. If they do not paste
   those pages together to hide the obnoxious passage, yet they do not
   like them opened too much. They would rather read a verse which looks
   more to their mind. But, Brothers and Sisters, if you and a text have a
   quarrel, make up with it at once! You must not alter the text--alter
   your creed, alter your life, alter your thought, God the Holy Spirit
   helping you--for the text is right and you are in the wrong!

   "Teach me to do Your will," means, if we pray it honestly, "I will
   search God's Word to know what His mind is." Why, there are numbers of
   you who join the Church you were brought up in, whatever it is! You do
   not take the trouble to examine as to whether your Church is Scriptural
   or not. This is a blind way of acting! This is not obeying the will of
   God. Know what God's Book teaches. Search the Scriptures! Many
   Christians believe what their minister preaches because he preaches it.
   Do not believe a word of what I preach unless you can find it in the
   Word of God. "To the Law and to the Testimony! If we speak not
   according to this Word it is because there is no light in us." We are
   all fallible and though we teach as best we can and hope that God
   teaches you much by us, yet we are not inspired and do not pretend to

   be!

   Search the Book of God on your own account and abide by what you find
   there and by nothing else. Where the Bible leads, you are bound to
   follow and following its guidance you shall not walk in darkness. Seek
   to know the will of God and when you know it, carry it out and pray the
   Holy Spirit to take away the dearest idol you have known--the thought
   that pleases you best--out of your mind if it is contrary to the
   supreme will of the eternal God! The Lord grant we may thus pray and
   thus be heard.

   Alas, unconverted people cannot pray after the fashion of my text. They
   have, first of all, to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ before they can
   do the will of the Lord. May you all be led to believe in the Savior
   and when you have done so, then may the Holy Spirit lead you to pray,
   "Teach me to do Your will; for You are may God." The Lord bless you,
   for Christ's sake. Amen.

   LETTER FROM MR. SPURGEON

   DEAR FRIENDS--I had joyfully expected to set out for home next Monday,
   but flights of letters have come to warn me against returning while an
   Arctic temperature freezes our native land. Many matters make me
   anxious to see my dear home and Church, but I submit to the loving
   advice of my Deacons, which has just reached me by telegram, and I
   shall abide in this warm retreat for another week, hoping for a change
   of weather.

   Yours heartily,

   C. H. SPURGEON

   Mentone, January 31, 1880

Pressing Questions of an Awakened Mind

   (No. 1520)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Who are You, Lord?...What will You have me to do?" Acts 9:5, 6.

   PAUL fell to the ground overcome by the brightness of the light which
   outshone the midday sun and as he lay there he cried, "Who are You,
   Lord?" After receiving an answer to his first question, he humbly asked
   another, "Lord, what will You have me to do?" This morning I spent all
   my strength and I scarcely have any remaining for this evening, but the
   subject was well worthy of the greatest exhaustion. I tried to show
   that we must receive the kingdom of Heaven as little children, or else
   we could not in any way enter into it. I wanted, if I could, to add a
   sort of practical tailpiece to that subject, something that would
   enable me, yet more fully, to explain the childlike spirit which comes
   at conversion and which is absolutely necessary as one of the first
   marks and consequences of the work of the Spirit of God upon the heart.
   I cannot find a better illustration of the childlike spirit than this
   which is now before us.

   Paul was a great man and, on the way to Damascus, I have no doubt he
   rode a very high horse. He verily thought that he was doing God
   service. He was a Pharisee of the Pharisees and had a very high
   estimate of his own character and, now that he had letters from the
   High Priest upon his person, he felt himself to be armed with great
   power and to be no mean man. He would let those poor Christians in
   Damascus know! He would worry them out of their fanaticism. He would
   take care to let them see that Saul of Tarsus was greater than Jesus of
   Nazareth. But a few seconds sufficed for the Lord to alter the man! How
   soon He brought Paul down! The manifestation of Jesus Christ, Himself,
   from Heaven soon subdued the great man into a little child, for the two
   questions which are now before us are exceedingly childlike.

   He enquires with sacred curiosity, "Who are You, Lord?" and then he
   surrenders at discretion, crying, "What will You have me to do?" He
   seems to cry, "I give up my weapons! I submit, receiving the kingdom of
   God as a little child to be Your servant! I only ask to be taught what
   I am to do and I am ready to do it. You have conquered me. Behold, at
   Your feet I lie--only raise me up and give me something to do in Your
   service, for I will gladly undertake it." To this spirit we must all
   come if we are to be saved! We must come to think of Jesus so as to
   desire to know Him. And then we must reverence Jesus so as to be
   willing to obey His will in all things.

   Upon these two points I am going to speak with a measure of brevity
   tonight. Our first object of thought will be the earnest enquirer
   seeking to know his Lord. The second will be the obedient disciple
   requesting directions.

   I. First, then, if any one of us would be saved he must be brought, by
   Divine Grace, to be AN EARNEST ENQUIRER AFTER THE KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST.
   He must ask the question, "Who are You, Lord?" Notice that he is
   willing to be taught. He lies there with the Christ above him and he
   asks Him a question. He is not only willing to learn, but he is eager
   to be taught. "Who are You, Lord?" is the utterance of his inmost soul.
   He wants to know. And do not you want to know, my Hearer? There is but
   one name given under Heaven whereby you must be saved! Do you not wish
   to know something about Him whose name it is? Are you indifferent to
   your soul's affairs, careless about what shall become of your immortal
   soul?

   Did Jesus die and is it nothing to you? Do you pass by His Cross as
   though it were the market cross of a village? Do you hear of His death
   as though it were some commonplace event in history to be once read and
   then forgotten? I pray it may not be so with you. But since you must
   either be lost or saved eternally, come and ask with deep anxiety, "Who
   are You, Lord? Who are You by whom I am to be saved? What right--what
   power have You to save? What claim have You upon my faith? Oh, tell me,
   for I long to know." Lack of thought ruins half of mankind! If men were
   but anxious to understand the Truth of God, they would soon learn it
   and receive it. If like the Bereans they would search the Scriptures to
   find the Truth, or if like Lydia their hearts were opened to receive
   it, they would soon know the Lord! Like Paul, we must be willing to
   learn.

   And, next, observe the subject that he wished to be instructed upon.
   "Who are Fou, Lord?" You have heard that Christ is the Savior--let your
   ambition be to know all about Him. I will tell you one thing--saints on
   earth and even saints in Heaven are always wanting to have this
   question more fully answered to them--"Who are You, Lord?" Those who
   know Him best will tell you that there is a something about Him which
   still surpasses all their knowledge! And I suppose that even when we
   see Him face to face there will remain a mystery in His matchless love
   and a depth unsearchable in His Divine Person into which even then we
   shall not be able to dive.

   "Who are You, Lord?" may well be the question of a soul that is seeking
   salvation, since it is still the question of those who have found it.
   "Who are You, Lord?" What is Your Person? What is Your Nature? How is
   it that You are able to save? Learn well that He is Divine, yet
   human--the Son of Mary and yet the Son of God. He is Man, your Brother,
   touched with the feeling of your infirmities, yet He is God eternal,
   infinite, full of all power and majesty, assuredly Divine! Learn this
   if you would be saved and regard the Lord Jesus as God over all,
   blessed forever, yet clothed in the form of a Servant and made in the
   likeness of sinful flesh. Learn that.

   "Who are You, Lord?" What are Your offices? If my eyes could see You I
   would ask You, what titles do You bear? What offices do You sustain? He
   is a Prophet--you must be instructed by Him and believe His teaching.
   He is a Priest-- you must be washed by His blood and He must offer
   sacrifice for you, no, rather, He has offered it and you must accept it
   as being for you and on your behalf! He is a King, too, and if you will
   be saved by Him you must let Him govern you. You must yield yourself to
   Him and be His subject and take up His Cross and bear His easy yoke
   which is no burden to the neck. Prophet, Priest, King and a thousand
   other offices does He sustain! Ask, you craving sinner, ask, "Who are
   You, Lord?" till you shall discover something about Him that exactly
   suits you and then your faith shall light upon it and your heart shall
   cry, "He is all my salvation and all my desire!"

   "Who are You, Lord?" It is a question you may ask about His
   relationships. Who is He? The Son of the Highest and yet the Brother of
   the lowest! Who is He? King of angels and King of kings and yet the
   Friend of sinners and the Helper of the humblest that will come to Him!
   He stands as the Head over all things to the Church--He is His Church's
   Husband and the world's Ruler--Master of Providence, Sovereign of
   Heaven, Conqueror of Hell itself! All power is in His hands. The Father
   has committed it unto Him and now He stands in such relationship to us
   that if we believe in Him, He gives us eternal life and guards us from
   all ill, for He has said, "I give unto My sheep eternal life and they
   shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of My hands."

   O beloved Hearer, if you would be saved, study deeply that question,
   "Who are You, Lord?" and be not satisfied till you know Christ and are
   known of Him--till there is a mutual knowledge between you and
   Himself--for it is only so that you can be saved. An unknown Christ is
   no Christ to you! A Savior whom you do not know is a Savior who will
   not know you in the day of His appearing! "Who are You, Lord?" Now,
   that question, as I have said, concerning Christ should be asked by all
   of us, but it is not at all a speculative question. It is a question of
   the utmost practical importance to every man, woman and child and in
   proportion as a man knows the answer to that question he will receive
   its practical result.

   Listen and understand this. "Who are You, Lord?" What will be the first
   result of having this question answered? Why, when Paul knew that He
   whose face had shone upon Him brighter than the sun was Jesus of
   Nazareth, He was seized with the deepest possible contrition. "What?"
   he seemed to say, "Have I persecuted the Lord? When I was hunting down
   those poor people, was I hunting down the Messiah? Was I fighting
   against the Christ of God?" He had not known that before, but when he
   knew who the Lord was, then his heart was broken within him with a deep
   sense of sin. Now, come here, some of you! You have been living for
   years refusing true religion and despising it, but have you ever
   thought that you were refusing Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and
   despising the Beloved of God who condescended to come into the world to
   suffer for love's sake?

   When they put Jesus to death He was, as our sweet poet puts it--"Found
   guilty of excess of love." It was all that could be laid to His dear
   charge and for excess of love He died. And you have refused Him! You
   have now, these 20 years and more, refused that thorn-crowned head,
   that brow so marred, those wounded hands, that gashed and wounded side!
   You have refused the matchless Savior without whom you are undone
   forever! Have you known this? Have you done it willfully? I hope you
   can reply, "But I did it ignorantly in unbelief." Therefore He winks at
   your ill manners and He bids you, now, come to Him and He will gladly
   receive you! He will in no wise cast you out! To know Christ, then, is
   a practi-

   cal knowledge, because it leads to repentance. When Christ is unknown,
   we can go on refusing and even persecuting Him. But when we clearly
   perceive that it is the Son of God and the bleeding Lamb whom we have
   refused and persecuted, then our hearts melt--we beg His forgiveness
   and cast ourselves at His feet.

   A second practical result is that then our hope is encouraged, for
   though Paul, at the sight of the Lord Jesus must have been full of
   bitter anguish, it was by that same sight that he was afterwards
   cheered and comforted. What? Are You in Heaven brighter than the sun?
   Are You the Man of Nazareth whom I have persecuted? Are You He who was
   rejected and despised? O You bright and shining One, are You that same
   Christ to whom the publicans and harlots drew near? Are You He who came
   to seek and to save that which was lost? Are You exalted on high to
   give repentance unto Israel and remission of sins? Then there is hope
   for me! It is the sinner's Christ that is in Heaven, the same that took
   the little children and said, "Suffer them to come to Me." Oh, then, I
   will trust Him! I feel I may, I can, I must! I yield myself to Him
   because I now know Him. I did not before. How practical is this
   knowledge!

   And it had another effect upon Paul. It led him to complete submission.
   He said, "Is this Christ whom I have rejected, Lord of All? Then it is,
   indeed, hard for me to kick against the pricks. I will not do so any
   longer. Resist Him? That I dare not do! If all power is in His hands,
   then to oppose Him is as hopeless as it is wicked! Behold, I surrender
   at discretion. O Lord Jesus, be my king. Accept me as Your subject. I
   oppose You no longer!" How I wish that Jesus would make some here know
   Him who have never known Him before--that they may at this very hour
   yield to Him because if once they knew Him it would fire them with
   ardor in His service! There was never a man yet that did really know
   Christ whom Christ did not fill with an inward flame so that he felt he
   could live or die for Him!

   Some human military leaders have had such extraordinary influence over
   their soldiers that they have commanded and have been cheerfully
   obeyed, even at the cost of life. The Christ of God has a superlative
   power over all hearts that know Him. See how Paul felt His influence
   and scoured the world to win Christ's lost ones! Perils of robbers;
   perils of rivers--the deep sea itself; scourging, stoning--all these
   were nothing to the Apostle from the day when he knew Christ! He had
   been exceedingly hot against Him, but now he burns and blazes with zeal
   for Christ. And so will it be with all who know Jesus! Right practical,
   then, is the question, "Who are You, Lord?" Oh that the Spirit of God
   would lead everyone to ask that question for himself!

   Only once more and I leave the question. It is this. While Paul was
   willing to learn, his subject was important, for he wished to learn of
   Christ and it was exceedingly practical, for it moved him to every good
   thing. But it is worthy of remark that he sought instruction from the
   best possible Master, for, my Brothers and Sisters, who can tell us who
   Christ is but Christ Himself? Here is His Book. Read it! It is the
   looking glass! Jesus is yonder and He looks into this Book and if you
   look into it with well-washed eyes, you may see His reflected image in
   this glass darkly, however, at the best. So, too, when you hear His
   faithful servants preach, you may see somewhat of Christ--but let me
   tell you there is no sight of Christ like that which comes personally
   to your own soul by the Holy Spirit.

   I do not mean that any men among us will ever see Christ while we are
   here with these eyes--and if we did, it might not do us good, for
   thousands saw Him who, nevertheless, cried, "Crucify Him." But I do
   mean that there are eyes inside these eyes--eyes of the mind and of the
   soul--to which Christ Himself must reveal Himself. And I charge you who
   have never seen Him to fall on your knees and cry, "Show Yourself to
   me!" You must have personal dealings with Him, each one for himself,
   and you may have these dealings! He is accessible tonight! He will
   receive you at once if you seek Him. He has declared that He will not
   cast any out that come to Him!

   Oh, will you not ask Him to show Himself to you? If you knew He would
   refuse you, you might be excused the prayer, but since He will manifest
   Himself to every contrite, lowly, seeking soul, will you not seek Him?
   Will you not, even now, humbly put this question to Him, "Who are You,
   Lord? Reveal Yourself to me, as You do not to the world, but as You do
   to seeking souls!" So, then, I leave that question to come to the
   second one. May the Holy Spirit help us while we handle it.

   II. "What will You have me to do?" THE OBEDIENT DISCIPLE REQUESTING
   DIRECTION. We are always telling you that whoever believes in the Lord
   Jesus Christ has everlasting life. That is the basic doctrine of the
   Gospel. But remember that we never told you that you might believe in
   the Lord Jesus Christ and then live as you liked! That is far from us.
   He who truly believes in Christ does as Christ bids him and becomes,
   from that time on, Christ's servant and disciple as well as His saved
   one. Therefore the question, "Lord, what will You have me to do?" You
   will notice that the

   Apostle here puts himself into the position of a soldier waiting for
   orders. He will not stir till he has received his officer's command.
   "Lord, what will You have me to do?"

   He stands quite ready to do it, but he needs to know what the order may
   be and, therefore, he looks up and prays, "Lord, direct me. What would
   You have me to do?" It is his Lord's will, alone, that Paul now means
   to do. "Lord, what will You have me to do?" Before, it used to be,
   "What will Moses have me to do?" And with some now present it has been
   "What should I like to do?" for whatever their soul lusts after, that
   have they done and whatever new pleasure, no matter how sinful it might
   be, if it were within their reach, they followed greedily after it! But
   he that would be saved must yield up his will to his Lord.

   Now, Beloved, take heed unto yourselves that Christ is your Master and
   nobody else. It would never do to say, "What would the Church have me
   to do?" As far as the Church teaches what Christ taught, obey her, but
   no farther. It would not even be right to say, "What would an Apostle
   have me to do?" Paul said," Be you followers of me, even as I also am
   of Christ." But if Paul does not follow Christ, we must not follow
   Paul! He says, "Though we, or an angel from Heaven, preach any other
   Gospel, let him be accursed." And so let it stand. I count it to be a
   sad lowering of a Christian's standard when he takes any mortal man
   living, or even any man now in Heaven to be his guide and master.

   "One is your Master, even Christ," and your question should be, "Lord,
   what will You have me to do? I see what I am bid to do in the Prayer
   Book. I see what I am bid to do by learned and godly men, but these
   things have no authority over my conscience. Lord, what would You have
   me to do? If it is not Your will and Your Word, I know there can be no
   light in it, but what I know not, teach me." And, then, notice that
   this childlike obedience of the Apostle is personal. It is, "Lord, what
   will You have me to do? I have little enough to do with my neighbors.
   They have their duty and their calling, but, Lord, what would You have
   me to do? Other persons must follow the light they have, but, Lord,
   what will You have me to do? My father, my brother, my friend--I have
   no right to judge these--to their own Master they must stand or fall.
   But, Lord, what would You have me to do?"

   You that look at your own inability when you come to Christ must come
   to Him with a personal faith, pleading for strength to do His will. You
   must yield to Jesus a personal obedience, even should it separate you
   from all your family! Let it separate the nearest ties. Let it cause
   your past friends to give you the cold shoulder. Let it subject you to
   persecution even unto death--you have nothing to do with these
   consequences--your business is to say, "Show me what You would have me
   to do and I will, in Your strength and by Your Grace, do it." I mention
   a little incident in my own personal history for which I have always
   had reason enough to thank God. When I was converted to God after some
   long time of bitter anguish of spirit, I found rest. And the very first
   thing I did when I found rest in Christ was to read, for myself, the
   New Testament and see what the Lord would have me to do.

   I found in the Word of God the duty of Believers' Baptism. I had never
   met with any Baptist friends in my life until I had, for myself,
   discovered the Truth of God. I had not even heard of their existence,
   so negligent had they been in the spreading of their views on that
   matter! But taking up the New Testament with my lexicon to see what the
   word meant, I found that the word, "baptize," signified to immerse.
   When I read the Scriptures I found everywhere that Believers were
   immersed. I did not, at first, know the existence of another person who
   held that opinion, but it did not matter to me the turn of a hair! I
   was only afraid that I might not find anybody to baptize me--but I
   meant to attend to the duty in some way or other!

   I discovered, afterwards, that there were many who had searched the
   Scriptures and had come to the same conclusion as myself. But to me,
   then, it seemed like walking away from all the Christian people that I
   knew. Have I ever regretted the step? No. Unimportant as some might
   think it, it gave to my whole spirit and life a tone for which I have
   reason to thank God. I stood upon my own feet, having read the Bible
   for myself. I took my own way in obedience to my Lord and Master and
   from that day I know that I have not willfully turned aside from His
   statutes, either in doctrines or in precept, but I have taught the
   faith as I have learned it! When I go to my chamber at night with a
   thousand imperfections to confess, yet I can feel that I have honestly
   and faithfully followed my Master.

   If I have erred, it has been from lack of light and not from lack of
   will to serve Him. But if I had ignored that first conviction and if I
   had made little nicks in my conscience at first, could I stand before
   you all this night and declare that I have not shunned both to do and
   to declare the whole counsel of God? I charge every young convert, as
   soon as he believes in Christ, to read and search the Bible for himself
   and say, "Show me what You would have me to do." I would

   rather be right, alone, than be wrong with all the world! And every
   honest Christian man ought to feel that he would rather follow Jesus
   Christ with two or three than run with a multitude after the traditions
   of men!

   God help you, Beloved, as soon as you are converted, to become
   thoroughly obedient disciples, searching the Word. I do not set so much
   importance upon the result of your investigation as I do upon the
   investigation, itself. I care less about the result you arrive at than
   I do for the Spirit which would lead you, as a disciple, earnestly to
   desire to follow your Master and would lead you to do everything that
   you believe to be His will--the little as well as the great. The Lord
   help us to be anxious to know and do His will in all things, regardless
   of consequences.

   Note again, that the Apostle not only puts it personally, but he pleads
   for Grace at once. "Lord, show me what You would have me to do?" as
   much as to say, "I will do it directly." He does not ask to be allowed
   a little delay, but, "What would You have me to do? Here I, Your
   willing servant, stand." Young man, if you would have salvation you
   must be ready to follow Christ tonight! Tonight, it may be, is the time
   when the Spirit of God is struggling with you and, if resisted, He may
   never return. Just now the scales hang in an even balance. Which way
   shall they turn? It may be tonight for life or death the scale shall
   turn for the last time. O blessed Jesus in Heaven, why should we
   hesitate if You will, indeed, save us? We may well make a complete
   surrender and say, "Now, even now, I enlist beneath Your banner, for I
   am Your willing servant."

   And observe, once more, that Paul does not make any kind of conditions.
   What would You have me to do? I will do it. If unpleasant to the flesh
   it shall be pleasant to my heart and if it appears stern, yet if You
   will help me, I will do it. "What will You have me to do?" Paul little
   knew, when he asked the question, what the doing of His Master's will
   would involve, but he meant at the time that whatever it would involve
   he was prepared for it. O you that would be Christians, do not suppose
   that it is just believing something--an article of a creed, or
   undergoing a ceremony that will save you! You must, if you are
   Christ's, yield yourselves up to Him! He did not come into this world
   to lead men to Heaven by back roads and crooked paths--He leads them
   into the way of righteousness, the end which is everlasting peace!

   Will you be child enough to follow Him? Will you have the childlike
   spirit which only needs, first, to know who He is and then exclaims--

   "Through floods or flames, If Jesus leads

   I'll follow where He goes"?

   The Lord grant it may be so with us! I close with just this remark,
   that it is by knowing Christ that you will learn to obey Him and the
   more you obey Him the more easy it will be. And in obeying Him you will
   find your honor. Paul at this day stands in a most honorable place in
   the Church of God simply because, being called of God to do His will,
   he did it faithfully even to the end. Is it not beautiful to see how
   Paul, in one moment, seems to have forgotten all his old Phariseeism?
   All the harsh words and bitter blasphemies that he had spoken against
   Christ--they were all gone in a moment! What strange changes will come
   over some beings in an instant!

   One of my students who had been a sailor has preached the Gospel for
   some long time, but his English was far from grammatical. Having been
   in college some little time he began to speak correctly, but suddenly
   the old habit returned upon him. He was in the Princess Alice [ship
   which sank with many aboard--ed] at the time of the lamentable
   catastrophe and he escaped in an almost miraculous manner. I saw him
   some time after and congratulated him on his escape and he replied that
   he had saved his life but had lost all his grammar. He found himself,
   for a while, using the language of two or three years ago--and even
   now, though he is recovering his spirits, he declares that he cannot
   get back what he had learned! He seems to have drowned his grammar on
   that terrible occasion.

   Now, just as we may lose some good thing by a dreadful accident or
   occurrence which seems to sweep over the mind like a huge wave and wash
   away our treasures, so by a blessed catastrophe if Christ should meet
   with anyone tonight-- much which he has valued will be swept away! You
   may write on wax and may make the record fair. Take a hot iron and roll
   it across the wax and it is all gone. That seems to me to be just what
   Jesus did with Paul's heart. It was all written over with blasphemy and
   rebellion and He rolled the hot iron of burning love over Paul's soul
   and the evil inscription was all gone. He ceased to blaspheme and he
   began to praise!

   May the same be done to many here present to the praise and glory of my
   Master's love and power! Amen and amen!

A Plain Answer to an Important Enquiry

   (No. 1521)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that you
   believe on Him whom He has sent." John 6:29.

   NOTICE the connection or you will miss the meaning of the words, for,
   at first sight it looks as if our Savior taught us that it is the work
   of God for us to believe on Him. Now, that would be quite true and it
   is very plainly taught in other parts of Scripture that faith is the
   work of God, but that is not the teaching in this particular instance,
   as will be very plain if you look at the context. First, our Savior
   said to the people, "See how you labor after the bread of your bodies.
   You have been running all round the coast to find Me in order that I
   might feed you again with loaves and fishes. Now," He says, "let your
   labor run after something better. Labor not for the meat that perishes,
   but for that which endures to life eternal."

   He gently rebukes them, "Do not spend all your strength in seeking
   after temporal good, but think about your immortal natures. Satisfy the
   hunger of your spirits, the better part of you." They immediately
   answered, "You tell us to labor after the bread that does not perish.
   What shall we do that we might work the work of God and so obtain it?"
   Our translation fails to let us see that they used precisely the same
   words as the Savior had done. He said, "labor," and they said, "What
   shall we do that we may labor this labor of God? What is it?" They took
   Him at His word and they put a question in accordance. When men begin
   to be awakened about spiritual things, they naturally cry, "What must
   we do to be saved? What must we do that we may work the work of God?"

   It is a faulty question--it is a question very much shaped by their
   ignorance and error. They suppose that there are works to be done, and
   merit to be earned by doing and obeying a law. And so they put it in
   that shape--"What shall we do? What shall we work that we may work the
   work of God?" The Savior did not chide them for the shape of the
   question. It was not the time to expect accuracy, but He gave them such
   Truth as they could understand and He replied, "You want to know what
   work you must do that shall be 'the work of God,' or a work pleasing to
   God? This, then, is 'the work of God,' the work most pleasing to God of
   all the works that can be done by men, that you believe on Him whom He
   has sent."

   The teaching here is not that faith is worked in us by God, which I
   have already said is a great Truth of God, but it is this--that if men
   desire to work, the first and chief of all work is that they believe on
   Jesus Christ whom God has sent! Does any man object to faith being
   called the work of man? If he does, I ask him why he objects. It is
   true that faith is the gift of God, but this does not change, for a
   moment, the other Truth of God that faith is the work of man--for it is
   and must be the act of man. No one in his senses can deny that! Will
   you venture to say that man does not believe? Then I venture to tell
   you that he who does not personally believe in Jesus is a lost man! And
   if there is such a thing as a faith which is not a man's own act and
   deed it will not save him.

   The man must, himself, believe or perish! This is the plain doctrine of
   Scripture. Repentance is worked in us by the Holy Spirit, but we must,
   ourselves, repent or we shall never be saved. Faith is worked in us by
   the Holy Spirit, but the Holy Spirit does not believe, or repent--these
   are a man's own acts! With our hearts we believe unto righteousness. If
   we do not believe, then we are not partakers of the promise which is
   given to those who do believe! Faith is, therefore, the work of man and
   it is the chief of works, the work most pleasing to God, the most
   godlike work, or, as the text puts it, "This is the work of God, that
   you believe on Him whom He has sent."

   To open up this one thought I pray for help from on high--it is just
   this--that faith is the most pleasing of all the works that man can do.
   It is here called, "the work," but not strictly and properly, for it
   can never be ranged with the works of the Law, from which it
   essentially differs. But the Savior took up the word which they used
   and spoke to their ignorance that He might instruct them.

   I. Regarding it as a work, faith is most pleasing to God, for, first,
   IT IS THE COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY OF ALL TRUE WORK. There lies within the
   loins of faith every possible form of holiness. As a forest may lie
   asleep within an acorn, so within the bounds of faith, little though it
   is, every virtue lies hidden. It may be microscopic in form, but it is
   certainly there and only needs development. Repentance dwells in faith,
   for he that believes in Jesus Christ unto salvation knows that he is a
   sinner and he must have some hatred of sin, or else he would not have
   taken Christ to deliver him from his sin.

   Love to God is there, for, most assuredly, when I trust a
   man--completely trust him--it would be impossible for me to do so
   unless I felt some leaning of my spirit towards him. The complete
   trusting of the soul to Christ, which is faith, has had in it no small
   measure of love to Christ. If I had before me a list of all the Graces
   of the Spirit of God and I were to take them up one by one and then
   analyze faith, I should find some measure of all these good works of
   the Spirit hidden away in the simple act of believing in Jesus Christ.
   I know what some of you have said--"Is that all that I am to do in
   order to be saved? Am I simply and only to believe in Christ, that is,
   trust myself with Him?"

   Yes, that is all and it is so small an act that the most uneducated
   heart can perform it! But yet, within it there are inconceivable
   mysteries of goodness! Just as sometimes inside a walnut shell I have
   seen packed away with careful art all sorts of gems and jewels, "with
   my lady's gloves to wear," so within this little walnut shell of,
   "believe and live," there will be found by any careful eye all the
   Graces of the Spirit of God. What is more, all the Graces come out of
   faith in due time, for faith sums up the whole of a Christian's life!

   Now, my Brothers and Sisters, I challenge you to read the 11th chapter
   of Hebrews and see if you can think of anything noble, brave, glorious
   which has not its counterpart in that chapter. But remember, it is a
   description of the heroism--not of this virtue or of that, but of
   faith. In the long list, beginning with Abel and going down to the
   last, faith worked all. From faith comes the power that stops the
   mouths of lions, quenches the violence of flames! Out of weakness men
   become strong. It is faith that tramples on temptation. It is faith
   that overcomes the world. It is faith that attains to holiness. Within
   the compass of that little babe whom you hold in your hand, a slender
   weight that you can scarcely feel, there are all the elements of yonder
   man of six feet who leads the van in the royal host and so the true
   Christian man in the perfection of the stature of Christ is all within
   the babe in Grace who cries, "Lord, I believe. Help You my unbelief."

   I can well understand why our Savior should say, "If you wish to work
   the work of God, you must believe in Jesus Christ whom He has sent,"
   for in that act lies all the virtues and out of that act will grow all
   the virtues in due time.

   II. But now, secondly, this simple matter of trusting Jesus Christ
   which is called FAITH, IS, IN ITSELF, MOST PLEASING TO GOD. First, it
   is the creature acknowledging its God. While a man says, "I do not care
   about my soul," he lives in atheism, disowning God, living as if there
   were no God. When a man says, "I need no saving," that is contradicting
   God's testimony wherein He declares that we are all gone out of the way
   and have altogether become abominable. When a man says, "I may be
   wrong, but I can get right by myself. My own good deeds will save me,"
   he is setting himself up in independence of his God. In fact, he is
   making himself his own god and so, practically, setting up another god.

   But when the man cries, "I have sinned," there is an acknowledgment
   that the Law is good and holy and just! When he then adds, "I have so
   sinned that I deserve punishment and I submit myself to it," there is a
   recognition of the court of Heaven and an admission of the
   righteousness of its sentences! The rebellious heart submits itself to
   the authority of God! When he further says, "But I have heard, great
   God, that You have given Your Son to bleed and die for sinners and that
   He is able to save to the uttermost them that trust Him and I do trust
   Him," the submission of the man to God is complete. Before, he said, "I
   do not believe it. It does not stand to reason"--that is proud Reason
   still a rebel. Or he said, "It may or may not be so, but I do not see
   the peculiar beauty of an atoning Sacrifice." There, again, is the
   proud heart kicking against God.

   But the man comes into his right place when he believes. When he
   believes in Jesus Christ and accepts mercy through the great Sacrifice,
   God is well-pleased because His poor erring creature has come into its
   right place and God sees in the act of faith the restitution of
   rectitude. Again, God is pleased with faith because it accepts God's
   way of reconciliation. God has given Christ that He might reconcile us
   to Himself by Him. When a man says, "I take Christ to be my Savior," he
   accepts God's way of reconciliation and then God must be reconciled,
   for He has promised to be so. As He longs to be reconciled and wills
   not that any should perish, but that they should come to repentance, so
   does He rejoice when they are willing to make peace with Him in His own
   appointed way. It shows a submission to His wisdom, a confidence in His

   love, a yielding to His Divine will and that is what He seeks after.
   All this, I say, is included in faith and makes it well pleasing to
   God.

   Perhaps the most acceptable element in faith to the eyes of God is the
   fact that it puts honor upon Jesus Christ, for He dearly loves His Son.
   We cannot tell how deep is the love of the Father towards His only
   begotten Son. That which dishonors Jesus must be very obnoxious to the
   Father and your self-confidence, my Friend, is a dishonor to the merit
   and salvation of Christ and God abhors it! But when you fling that all
   away and have no hope but in the great Atonement which He has made,
   then, I say, because your faith honors Jesus, therefore God delights in
   it and He will honor your faith. It is not possible that He should cast
   a soul away that clings to the great High Priest. Oh, if you look to
   Jesus, you shall never lose your sight! If your heart clings to Jesus,
   that heart of yours shall never lose its life! If your soul joys in
   Jesus, that soul of yours shall never lose its joy!

   The fact is, that faith puts us into a right relationship with God, for
   what is the right relationship of a creature to his God but that of
   dependence? Is it not most suitable that since God made us and He has
   all power and all strength, we should depend upon Him for our being, as
   well as for our well-being? See how He hangs the world upon nothing!
   This round globe never starts nor falters, but is steadily upheld in
   its mighty march by the unseen hand of God! Yonder stars, mighty worlds
   though they are, have no power to keep themselves in their places but
   the power of God which established them. All things hang upon Him and
   the only position for a created being is that of entire
   dependence--what is that but

   faith?

   I believe that there is faith in Heaven. Do not tell me there is no
   faith there. I believe it to be the essence of Heaven that the
   glorified exercise unquestioning faith and never feel a doubt. It will
   be the joy of every spirit before the Throne of God to depend every
   moment for its immortality and bliss upon God and to be quite confident
   that He will never fail it. Some sorts of faith will be turned to
   sight--but if faith is confidence in God, I bless God I shall have a
   great deal more of it in Heaven than I can have here! A perfect child
   must have a perfect faith in a perfect Father. Because faith brings the
   creature back to conscious dependence, God is well-pleased with it.

   Faith restores us by putting us into a place of childlike rest. If a
   son has fallen into the hands of a malicious individual who has
   whispered into his ear that his father hates him--that he is doing all
   he possibly can to ruin him--at first the youth will not believe the
   accusation, but perhaps, after a while, he begins to think it is true.
   From that time forward every action that his father makes will be
   interpreted the wrong way--and if there is anything in the father's
   life which is more kind than usual, it is highly probable that this
   poor misled boy will see a deeper subtlety of malice in it than in his
   father's ordinary actions! The lad will break his father's commands and
   vex and anger him. What is the first thing to be done to set that youth
   right?

   You may make him dread his father and then he will behave properly in
   his outward actions, but he will only be waiting his time to break
   loose. Suppose it to be possible to make him believe in his father and
   to be assured that his father loved him and had, all along, been the
   kindest man on earth? Why he would run into his father's arms! He will
   be willing enough to obey a parent whom he trusts--it will be his
   delight to do so! You have won his confidence and everything is right
   now. This is what faith does to us. The devil and our own corrupt
   nature say, "God is unkind, for He has made an awful Hell," and so on.
   Faith interposes and cries, "He has put away His wrath. He has made
   full atonement for sin. He is willing to receive us."

   Then faith says, "Trust Him. Trust Him implicitly." And when the soul
   has done that, then faith testifies, "He has loved you with an
   everlasting love. Jesus died for you and He has provided a Heaven for
   you." Let this be known and felt and what a change takes place! Oh,
   then you hate your sin! Oh, then you are ready to say, "How could I
   play the fool against One so kind, so good, so right?" Under this
   impulse you will serve Him and live for Him! That simple matter of
   believing Him has done it all! It is the hinge on which character
   turns. Hard thoughts of God lead to acts of rebellion, but a childlike
   confidence in Infinite Love softens the heart and sanctifies it and
   makes the man a true child towards the great Father.

   Do you wonder, then, that there is much in faith, in itself, which is
   pleasing to God? And if you ask what great works you are to do to
   please God, we shall not tell you to build a row of almshouses, or
   endow an orphanage, or give your body to be burned--believe in Jesus
   Christ and you have done more than all these things put together!

   III. And now a third reason why faith is so great a thing is
   this--FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST IS THE TEST OF WORKING FOR GOD, for all the
   works that ever were, without faith in Jesus Christ, are not works for
   God at all. Let me explain and prove my point. Suppose that a person
   should say, "But I mean to live for the great God and work for Him."
   Without faith the spirit of work is wrong. My Friend, suppose you said
   to me, "I will live for you and spend my life in your service, but I am
   not going to believe what you say"? There would be a point of
   disagreement between us which would render it impossible for you to be
   of any service to me, or for anything that you did to be of any value
   to me. You call me a liar to begin with and then say you serve me?

   Many of you that have heard the Gospel may, perhaps, think that you are
   serving God, though you have never believed in Christ. But, I tell you,
   your best actions are nothing but whitewashed sins! All that you do
   must be destitute of real excellence because you begin by making God a
   liar! It is a hard word, you say. I cannot help it--it is the word of
   John, the most gentle spirit among all Biblical characters. John says,
   "He that believes not has made God a liar because he has not believed
   on the Son of God." If you begin by calling God a liar, I do not care
   much what you do after that. I would a great deal rather you should be
   moral than immoral and sober than drunk, but, after all, you will be
   lost in either case if you persevere in calling God a liar!

   All your holiness will be a sham if you will not believe in Jesus. The
   test of true work for God is this--"That you believe on Jesus Christ
   whom He has sent." Without faith the motive of work fails. "But," cries
   another person, "I believe I have deserved well of God! I have kept
   myself pretty right and I have performed many good deeds." What have
   you done them for? "I have been working for my salvation," says one. In
   other words, you have been working for yourself. Pay yourself, then!
   Self is first and last--your works are selfishness from top to bottom!
   You have been trying to be good to get to Heaven by it. It is a mean,
   beggarly life that begins and ends with self! Your Maker, whom you were
   bound to love with all your heart, you have not loved at all except
   that you have meanly pretended to love Him in order to save yourself!

   You had a kind of cupboard love to Him, such as an ass or an ox might
   have to a corn bin, or a stall, but no real affection. How can you
   perform a virtuous act while self is your tyrant lord? When you have
   once believed in Jesus Christ then you are saved and from that day on
   you live to glorify the name of the Lord--you live to work out that
   which He has worked in you--to will and to do of His own good pleasure.
   But until you are saved by faith, self is necessarily your first
   thought. No man is capable of virtue as long as self is his objective
   and every man must make self his objective till he is saved! When he is
   saved, he rises into a nobler atmosphere altogether and then his works
   are acceptable to God. Do you not see that you have to get out of
   self-righteousness and to be saved by believing in Christ before you
   can begin to do anything that will be really working for God? Up to
   that point it will be all working for yourself and that is a poor, poor
   thing which cannot please the most high God.

   Beloved Friends, living by faith in Jesus Christ is the evidence of
   your sincerity in any work that you do for God, for can there be any
   real working for God while your own pride is uppermost? God tells you
   that your best works are imperfect and will not save you and He hangs
   His own dear Son upon the Cross to save you because you are a sinner.
   You turn your back to the Cross--you say, "My own merits are good
   enough," and then you talk about serving God after that? Can He accept
   anything at your hands after you have rejected His Son and insulted
   Him? You have touched the Lord in the most tender point when you have
   taken your own detestable righteousness which is just a heap of
   infected rags--a mass of abominable filth in the sight of God--and have
   preferred it to the blood and righteousness of His only Son!

   After such an atrocious crime as this, how dare you talk about doing
   service to God! It is impossible, Sir! There is a lie in the bottom of
   your heart. Get rid of it! How can you serve the Lord while your pride
   thus angers Him? He tells you that you must bow before His Son and
   trust in Him and you reply, "No, I must feel something or do
   something." That is as much as saying, "I will be saved in my own way."
   You talk about serving God after that evil, "I will," of yours has been
   defying Him? Suppose that one of your family will not do what you tell
   him? He defies you to your face. He says he will have his own way and
   then he goes into the garden and he plucks you a flower--and he expects
   that the gift will please you.

   What? Brought in a rebellious hand? While he is in a willful state and
   boiling over with bad temper? Does he think to please you by such a
   trifle? You say, "No, my child, that cannot be. You must first bow
   before your father and acknowledge that you have done wrong." He may
   pout his lips and say he will never obey you and then ask to kiss you.

   Will he have his kiss? Assuredly not till first of all he will submit!
   That is just the condition of many a seeker after God. He has a wicked
   pride in his heart and a rebellious will and if he will believe in
   Jesus it will be a proof that his pride and rebellion are given up. But
   if he will not yield and trust, neither can he expect that God will
   save him!

   IV. I would say, in the fourth place, that faith in God is a most
   blessed and acceptable thing because IT IS THE SEAL OF ALL OTHER
   BLESSINGS. Notice that faith in God is the seal--first, of our
   election. Read the 37th verse, "All that the Father gives Me shall come
   to Me." Now, if you come to Christ, dear Friend, you are one that His
   Father gave Him! You are one of His elect! Oh, what a blessing this is.
   The doctrine of Election is full of rich comfort to all who are
   interested in it and election, itself, is the greatest of all favors.
   "But how am I to know that I am one of God's elect?" By this testimony,
   "All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me." Every elect soul that
   reaches adult age is brought to believe in Jesus Christ and as sure as
   ever you are brought to believe in Jesus Christ, you may be absolutely
   certain that you are predestinated to eternal life!

   In the next place, faith seals our effectual calling. If you look a
   little farther down you will see, "No man can come unto Me except the
   Father which has sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last
   day." These are the express words of Christ and they show that every
   man that comes to Christ must have been drawn by the Father. That is to
   say, that effectual calling has exerted its Divine power upon him. No
   man need say, "Am I drawn of the Father?" after he is once sure that he
   has faith in Jesus Christ, for you never could have believed in Jesus
   Christ unless this had been given you from Heaven. The 44th verse is as
   plain as possible, "No man can come to Me except the Father which has
   sent Me draws him." You have come to him and, therefore, the Father
   must have drawn you.

   The next thing that faith assures us of is final perseverance. Read the
   47th verse--"He that believes on Me has everlasting life." You need not
   raise the question, "Have I received everlasting life?" Raise this
   question, first, "Have I believed in Jesus Christ?" If so, you have
   everlasting life. Not a life, mark you, that will last you up to the
   end of the quarter when you take a new ticket--nor a life that will
   preserve you to old age and then leave you to temptation and death. No,
   "He that believes on Him has everlasting life" And it is not
   everlasting life if it does not last forever. Herein he that believes
   has the guarantee of final perseverance.

   Did not Jesus say, "I give unto them eternal life and they shall never
   perish, neither shall any pluck them out of My hands"? Are we not told
   of him that believes in Christ that there shall be in him a well of
   water springing up unto everlasting life? Or, as Christ puts it in this
   very chapter, "He shall never hunger and he shall never thirst." He has
   drunk a draught of eternal life in Christ Jesus and he shall never
   thirst again! This is a great deal for faith to bring to us, but it is
   not all, for two or three times over we are told here that whoever
   believes in Christ shall be raised up again at the last day--so that
   faith secures resurrection! Read the 39th verse and then the 49th
   verse--"This is the will of Him that sent Me, that everyone which sees
   the Son and believes on Him may have everlasting life and I will raise
   him up at the last

   day."

   How do I know that I shall have a blessed resurrection? How can I be
   certain that though the worms devour this body, yet when Christ shall
   stand in the latter day upon the earth, in my flesh I shall see God? I
   may be quite sure of it because I believe in Jesus Christ whom He has
   sent! Beloved, faith is the seal at the bottom of the title deed which
   secures all things for time and eternity to the man that has it! If you
   are a Believer, all the wheels of Providence revolve for you! If you
   are a Believer, every angel spreads his wings for you! If you are a
   Believer, life is yours and the death which seems to close it is only
   the appointed janitor to open the door of another and a brighter
   chamber! If you believe, God Himself is yours and Christ, His Son, is
   yours! If you believe, Heaven, with its eternity and infinity of joy
   which your eye has not seen, nor your heart conceived of, is yours!

   Nothing shall be kept back from the man that believes his God and
   trusts his Redeemer! Oh that the Lord would give faith to you all!
   "Alas," you say, "I do not feel right." Never mind your feelings, trust
   in Christ! "Oh, but I am such a sinner." Jesus Christ came into the
   world to save sinners. "Alas, but I have tried before." Away with all
   your trying before! Have done with trying and accept the finished work!
   Trust Jesus now! "Do you mean that if I now trust myself with Christ, I
   shall be saved while sitting in the pew?" I mean even so! Be you
   whoever you may be, this night look to Jesus and be saved! If you will
   have done with yourself and will trust your soul in the hands of Jesus
   who has sworn to save those that rest themselves upon Him, you are
   saved!

   Oh, that those who have heard this Gospel many times would now, for the
   first time, really understand it and say, "Is this, after all, the
   greatest of all works--that I believe in Jesus Christ whom He has sent?
   Lord, I believe--help You my unbelief and save me now." O God, help
   many to breathe the prayer of faith at this moment, for Jesus' sake.
   Amen.

Expected Proof of Professed Love

   (No. 1522)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Show you the proof of your love." 2 Corinthians 8:24.

   IN every Believer's heart there is love to God, otherwise he cannot be
   a child of God! In every Christian's soul there is love to Jesus
   Christ. How could he be a Christian otherwise? As a consequence of
   this, in every Christian's bosom there is a love to the
   brotherhood--"We know that we have passed from death unto life because
   we love the brethren." In every Christian's breast there is also a love
   to all mankind. He practices that second great Commandment, "You shall
   love your neighbor as yourself." The spirit of God has cast out the
   demon of selfishness and, in proportion as that is the case, the man
   possesses the mind of Christ which is love. As all the Law is fulfilled
   in one word which is, "love," so the outcome of our holy faith is also
   contained in that one word, "love."

   Oh that we were saturated with it! Where there is true love in the
   heart, it becomes a working principle. It does not lie dormant, but it
   works--works abundantly! It is a vital principle that where there is
   life there is movement and a measure of activity. It is a principle
   that grows and out of its growth there comes fruit. For these reasons
   and in these ways, true Believers give sure proofs of the love that is
   in their hearts. I wish to speak to you, at this time, by answering
   four questions.

   I. First, WHAT IS THE EXCELLENCE OF THIS LOVE that we should be so
   anxious to prove it? This Christian love must have some great worth
   about it, or else we should not be exhorted by the Apostle once and
   again to prove that we have it. Remember, first, that true love to God
   and the saints in the Christian heart is Divine in its origin. We would
   never have loved God if He had not first loved us! And, unless His Holy
   Spirit had turned the stream of our affections in that direction, we
   would have run away from God and have hated God and we would neither
   have loved Him nor His people. It is the nature of the seed of the
   serpent to hate the Seed of the woman and as long as we are under
   condemnation and wrath and in our natural state, we are on the
   serpent's side and we war against that which is good.

   "The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the
   Law of God, neither, indeed, can be." If, therefore, we have even a
   spark of love to God, God must have given it to us! It is, therefore, a
   precious thing because it is of God and we ought to take heed that we
   assuredly possess it. And we also should endeavor to live so that
   others may be convinced that this Divine principle rules our spirits.
   As it is Divine in its origin, so it is surpassing in its energy, for
   true love to God exceeds all other love. Does not Christ tell us that a
   man must love Him better than father or mother, or the dearest relative
   he has, or else he does not love Him at all?

   Christ will not be put off with the leftovers of our heart. He must
   have our whole heart. All human affections which are natural and proper
   are to be held in subservience to this grand and master passion which
   is to set our soul on a blaze--love to God in Christ Jesus. He loves
   not Christ at all who does not love Him first and last. This affection,
   like Aaron's rod, must swallow up all others and our whole heart must
   belong to the Lord our God! We must take care that we give proof of an
   affection which is so surpassing in its energy, for surely, if it has
   such force, it must produce its own proof!

   If it were some minor passion--some little narrow jet of flame that
   might light up a corner of our being--we might not be so particular
   about it. But if it is to fire our entire manhood, it must produce some
   effect or else we may well question whether we possess it. This love is
   absolutely vital in its necessity. If it can be proven that a man does
   not love God, love Christ and love His people, then the life of God
   does not dwell in him. Life and love are two words singularly alike
   and, when we get to the bottom and radical principle of the spiritual
   nature, we perceive that they are singularly bound up together insomuch
   that, "He that dwells in love dwells in God and God in him."

   These are some of the Apostle John's great little words, which, in
   their miniature form, contain whole worlds of meaning. Beloved, we must
   love God, or else we are not in Christ! Hence the importance that the
   proofs of our love

   should be very distinct and unmistakable. We should make our calling
   and election sure--and those things can never be sure unless we have
   abundant proofs of our love. It is vital in its necessity. However
   great that love becomes and I have spoken of it as rising to a
   superlative degree, it is warranted by the facts of the case. Love to
   God--I will not spend a word in justifying it. Love to Christ--how can
   it be necessary to commend it to you?--

   "Love so amazing, so Divine,

   Demands our soul, our life, our all."

   And it shall have it, too!

   Do you not say so, my Brothers and Sisters? Do you not yield to this
   soft, yet mighty bond--soft as silk, yet strong as iron? It holds us
   fast! We cannot escape from it. Not love Christ? Not love His people?
   Not love the world of lost sinners? Oh, Sirs, surely we were, of all
   creatures, the most brutish if we were to dispute the necessity of
   love! "You know the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was
   rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you, through His poverty
   might be rich." Go and love Jesus Christ till men call you a fanatic!
   Go and love Him till you give all your goods to feed the poor! Go and
   love Him till you lie in a prison and the moss grows on your eyelids!
   Go and love Him till you burn to ashes at the stake and you have not
   loved Him one whit more than He deserves!

   O our best Beloved, You, Yourself, warrant us in permitting our zeal
   for You to eat us up and, eaten up, we would be for Your Glory's sake!
   This love to Christ has been, in all ages, very eminent in its
   achievements. Wherever love reigns in a Christian, it makes him strong.
   Faith laughs at impossibilities and cries, "It must be done!" But love
   performs the deed, for, "faith works by love." Love is the right hand
   of faith. What have not men done out of love to Christ? Truly, the time
   would fail me to tell of its exploits. What you shall do, dear Sister,
   if you become full of love to Jesus, will astonish you! And what you
   shall do, dear Brother, if the love of Christ burns through your soul,
   will far exceed what you have dreamed of as yet. Oh, for more love!

   Let the martyrs tell you what poor suffering flesh and blood can do
   when love strengthens it! Let holy women that have debated and disputed
   and bled and died for Christ and in all their timidity and weakness
   made brave as lions for Christ tell what love has done! Let the walls
   of the Coliseum at Rome; let the arenas of hundreds of amphitheaters
   tell how bravely men have played the man--how bravely women have met
   death for Christ's sake! All that the Church needs is the Holy Spirit
   to baptize her into the love of Christ and nothing will be impossible
   to her!

   Thus have I tried to commend this love and surely we ought to be able
   to prove that we have it. If we have any question as to whether we have
   it or not, let us find no rest, day or night, till the grand debate is
   ended! We MUST love Christ or perish! Oh, by the certainty that His
   saints shall see Him face to face and be like He, let us rise to
   something nobler in the form of love to Him than we have ever reached
   as yet! This is the love which we are to give proof of.

   II. Secondly, WHAT IS THIS PROOF? The text says, "Show you to them and
   before the churches, the proof of your love." What proof shall we show?
   There are so many forms of action which would prove love to Christ that
   I cannot possibly go through them all, especially as each person, I
   believe, will give a different proof of his love. There is (to use a
   difficult word) an idiosyncrasy about each Believer. He is a man by
   himself and his love, if it is genuine, will take a form peculiar to
   himself in the proof which it gives. Certain proofs look towards God
   and the Lord Jesus. If you love Him, you will keep His Commandments and
   His Commandments are not grievous.

   If you love Him, you will seek to honor Him--to spread the savor of His
   glorious name. If you love God in Christ Jesus, you will be anxious to
   extend His rule over the hearts of men. If you love God, you will long
   for communion with Him--you will not be satisfied to live for days
   without speaking with Him. If you love Him, you will grieve yourself
   when you grieve Him--your heart will smite you when you have gone
   astray. If you love God, you will long to be like He--you will strive
   after holiness. If you love God, He will reign over you--Christ will be
   your King. Your mind will be under subjection to Him. Your thoughts
   will be guided by Him. Your opinions will be taken from His Word. Your
   whole life will be seasoned by His Spirit which dwells in you. Do you
   not see that there are hundreds of ways in which you can show proof of
   your love towards God? Oh, that we may not be found lacking in any of
   these things!

   We may show this love, in the next place, towards God's ministers. I
   cannot help mentioning them because the Apostle so distinctly, in this
   chapter, speaks of himself and his Brothers. And one special way of
   showing it is this--if they speak well of you, do not let them have
   cause to retract their holy boasts and have to say with tears, "I was
   deceived in these people." If any have brought you to Christ, be an
   honor to them and to the Gospel that they preach, because, dear

   Friends, the world turns round and however retired a minister may be,
   yet worldlings are sure to throw the inconsistencies of his people in
   his teeth. They say, "That is one of So-and-So's people! Look how he
   acts!" And our ministry is hindered and our hearts are grieved whenever
   those who profess to have been brought to Christ walk unworthily. Show
   us a proof of the love you often express to us as your servants in
   Christ Jesus by endeavoring so to walk that when we give our account we
   may do it with joy and not with grief, for that would be unprofitable
   to you.

   Next, show proofs of your love in reference to God's people. How can
   that be done? Some of you need to have this thing gone over with you
   because you have evidently forgotten it. If you are God's servants, you
   love His people and the first proof you should give is to go and join
   with them. Say, "Where is the list of their names kept? I will count it
   an honor to have my name enrolled." Certain of you say, "I should count
   it an honor, but I have hardly the courage to come forward." What? Have
   I been sitting these various days to see the timid ones and have you
   not all come? We will have another time for you, then, and try if we
   cannot get you right, for really, we are not so frightful as you think
   we are and you need not be timid about telling to a poor servant of
   Jesus Christ that you really love the name of his Master! He will be
   glad and so will you.

   No, but you say you are half afraid of yourself I wish you were
   altogether afraid of yourself. The more afraid of yourself the better,
   for you are good for nothing in yourself! But do not be afraid of
   trusting yourself with Jesus and when you have done so, then the very
   next thing is to become identified with the visible Church of Christ!
   If you say, "I love the Brethren," the Brethren may turn round and say,
   "Give us a proof of your love. Cast in your lot with us." Do as she did
   who, though she had been a heathen, nevertheless clung to one who
   worshipped the true God and said, "Where you go, I will go; and where
   you lodge, I will lodge. Your people shall be my people and your God my
   God."

   And when you have joined the Church, then surely you should show a
   proof of your love by a hearty fellowship with the saints. We do not
   need you to put your name in the book and to be a professor and then
   sit in one of those pews up in the corner and come in and go out and
   never speak to anybody! I meet, even now, with some who say, "I have
   been at the Tabernacle for months and nobody has ever spoken to me."
   Well, I know that there are so many earnest Christians on the watch
   here to speak with strangers that if you have not been spoken to it
   must be your own fault! Perhaps you are some dreadfully stiff body and
   you have frightened them. I do not know, but it may be so. There are
   some who look as if they said, "Do not come near me. I do not need any
   questions asked me."

   We have some Brothers and Sisters who will break through your
   stiffness, though, I dare say. But if it is really so, I am very sorry
   for it and it need not be so any longer. Speak to somebody at this very
   service! I do not dislike to hear a low hum of godly conversation
   before service begins, though some people think it horrible. Neither do
   I deprecate a little lingering upon the steps and around the
   building--you are holding fellowship, one with another, and I like that
   it should be so, for we do not meet too often. It is no desecration of
   the Sabbath or of the place of worship for Christian people to speak
   with one another to edification.

   When you join the Church, join it in earnest and converse much with the
   people of God! And by your hearty zeal show them a proof of your love.
   And then unite with them in all their service. The school needs Sunday
   school teachers. You love Christ, you say, and you love the young--show
   us a proof of your love! Come and help in that good work. There is
   something or other that you can do for Jesus and for His Church--do it
   and thus show us a proof of your love! Show the proof of your love by
   comforting the saints in affliction--by helping them, as much as you
   can, when they are in need--by defending their good name whenever you
   hear them railed at. Prove your love by suffering nobody to speak
   against them falsely when you are by. Stand up for them! Show them the
   proof of your love by bearing with their infirmities.

   The Church is not perfect and if it were, it would not be perfect after
   you had joined it! You who have so many infirmities, yourself, should
   patiently bear with the infirmities of others. If the saints are not
   all you would like them to be, remember, nevertheless, that they are
   dear to the heart of Christ and He, perhaps, sees in them beauties
   which you would see, too, if you had more beauties yourself! Perhaps
   your power to find fault arises from your having so many faults
   yourself and if you were more sanctified and more like Christ, you
   would fix your eyes, as well, upon the beauties of their character as
   upon their defects. Show us the proof of your love! I am not speaking
   as though I did not see among you abundant proofs of your love--but I
   am speaking to some who, perhaps, as yet, have never realized their
   position of

   privilege in reference to Christ and to His people--and they have never
   let their hearts go out as they should go out towards those whom Christ
   has purchased with His precious blood.

   Show us the proof of your love to the ungodly, too--to this great city
   of four millions! Show us the proof of your love by trying to snatch
   the firebrands from the flame. Be up and doing. Stand at the street
   corners, if you can, and preach Jesus Christ! Scatter the printed
   Gospel in every room to which you have access. Talk of Christ to your
   work people. Speak of Him to your companions. Endeavor to spread this
   potent all-heal--this cure for all manner of spiritual diseases--for
   otherwise, talk as you may, profess as you may--we shall have to say to
   you, "Show us the proof of your

   love."

   I have only given you a sort of charcoal sketch of what might be the
   proof of your love--I have not drawn the picture or laid on the colors.
   Think, dear Friends, how you can give such proof at once.

   III. But now, in the third place, WHY IS THIS PROOF CALLED FOR?
   Somebody says, "Why am I called upon to prove my love?" Do not grieve,
   even if I press it very hard upon you, for your case will be something
   like that of Simon Peter when he, too, was pressed exceedingly. Peter
   was grieved when his Master said to him the third time, "Simon, son of
   Jonas, do you love Me?" Now the Lord did not ask it because He doubted
   him, for He knew Peter's heart. Peter's appeal was a true one, "You
   know all things. You know that I love You." Do not, therefore, resent
   it and say, "Why should I prove my love?" No, but just listen.

   True love always longs to prove itself--it does not need a command to
   do it! It is waiting for an opportunity. It is so with your domestic
   life. You know that it is so! I need not give instances. What a
   pleasure it is to show love to those we love! In a far higher degree,
   what a delight it is to a Christian to do something for Jesus! If you
   have never done anything distinctly for Jesus, what sort of a child of
   God can you be? I love my Master's service and I can truly say that I
   think that I would do anything for His people--but I am not quite so
   sure about that as I am about the feeling that I would do anything for
   Him. When I get a hold of something that is distinctly and undividedly
   for my Lord's Glory, I am glad to do it!

   To break an alabaster box of ointment upon His head is a rich
   delight--truly, it might have been given to the poor and have blessed
   the poor, but Jesus, Himself, is best! "It is a waste," somebody
   murmurs. Yes, yes, but to be wasteful for Christ is the noblest
   economy! O hearts that love your Lord, never count the silver when you
   are spending for Jesus! Break the box! Pour out the ointment! The room
   will be filled with the perfume and it will not be wasted. Even if
   there were no nostrils to smell it, if only Jesus had the refreshment
   of it, it would be all the better!

   I like to enter the glade of a forest where there are spots unseen by
   eyes of man and thickets of brush through which nobody but the red deer
   has ever passed! I delight to sit down by a little rippling brook upon
   a bank of thyme undese-crated by human foot and think, "This is God's
   garden and every leaf waves for Him." How dare the poet say that
   flowers which were born to blush unseen are wasting their fragrance on
   the desert air? Why, they are flowering for God and He delights in them
   and they are just the best used flowers in the world! Oh to be just
   such a flower as that at times and to feel that you have got away--away
   from the gardens where men may come and praise or offend and offer
   mercenary prizes for flowers and fruits--away where God sees you and
   delights in you! We should try to work for Jesus only. Proof is called
   for, not because Jesus doubts, but because He loves to please us by
   giving us opportunities of proving our love!

   But one reason why we are called upon to prove our love is that it may
   become a blessing to other people. The Corinthians were to prove their
   love because the poor folks at Jerusalem were starving. It would be of
   no use for the Corinthians to sing a hymn about charity while the poor
   saints at Jerusalem had not a loaf to eat. No, they must prove their
   love that it might be a benefit to others and that the influence of
   that love might spread to others, because the Apostle said, "If you
   Corinthians do not discharge your promise, those people at Macedonia
   will throw it in my teeth and do nothing, themselves, and, therefore,
   for the sake of the Churches in Macedonia, you must be generous."

   So, Beloved, oftentimes one man, by serving his Master well, stirs up a
   whole regiment of other Christians who become ashamed to be doing so
   little! I may preach a great many sermons, Brothers and Sisters, but
   they will do very little good compared with what your sermons will do,
   if, as a Church, you live up to the mark as Christians! If, in holy
   love and concord and every Grace, you abound, other Churches will say,
   "Look at this Church!" Oh that you may be such saints that others may
   be encouraged in their work for Christ by you! That is why you are
   asked to prove your love!

   You are asked to prove your love, for it is reasonable that you should
   do so. God did not love you and keep it to Himself and say, "My name is
   Love, but I will do nothing." No! He gave His Son from His bosom, His
   only Son, and that

   Son He gave to die. God is practical. That which He feels, He
   does--that which He speaks is done. We have many idle words, but the
   word and mind of God come out in deeds of Grace. Is it not right,
   therefore, that we should give practical proof of our love?

   IV. Time fails me, or I would have dwelt on the fourth point, namely,
   WHO IT IS THAT CALLS FOR THIS

   PROOF OF OUR LOVE? I will leave out everybody else but One and say it
   is your Lord--your own dying, living Savior who says, "Show Me the
   proof of your love." I will tell you how He is saying it. Affliction
   has come into your house. There is a dear one dead and Jesus says, "Now
   will you kick against Me, or will you yield Me your treasure? Simon,
   son of Jonas, do you love Me more than these dear ones? If so, you will
   part with them and not complain." "Mary, do you love Me better than
   mother, or sister, or friend? If so, you will bless Me when I take them
   away. Now is your time--show Me the proof of your love by bowing before
   My chastening and love Me still."

   Our Lord only takes from us what He gave to us! Let us, therefore,
   bless His name! Bereaved one, that may be the proof of love to which He
   is calling you. Perhaps you have had a difference lately with one to
   whom you ought to be united in friendship and now your conscience is
   saying, "Christians ought to live in peace and love." But Satan is
   saying "You were not to blame. Do not humble yourself before such a
   proud person as your opponent." But my Lord and Master says to you,
   "Show Me the proof of your love. Forgive him for My sake even to 70
   times seven. And if you have wronged him, confess the wrong and humble
   yourself for My sake. Because I washed My disciples' feet, show Me the
   proof of your love by washing one another's feet." Attend to that
   admonition, I pray you!

   But possibly there are some here who have had in their minds the
   project of doing something unusual for Jesus, or the Church, or the
   poor, or for missions to the heathen. Satan has said, "You must not
   give as much as that." Jesus says, "I have prospered you--when others
   have failed in business I have taken care of you. Show Me the proof of
   your love." Will you not hear His call? Do not hold back your hand and
   do not need anybody to persuade you, because that will spoil it all. It
   must be spontaneous! It must come from your heart, moved only by the
   Spirit of God, if you wish it to be accepted.

   Perhaps I am addressing a young man who has been, for years, a member
   of the Church and it is crossing his mind, "What shall I do to show my
   love?" And, perhaps, it is his ambition to be a missionary in a distant
   land. Keep not yourself back, my dear young Brother! Should it rend a
   fond connection, or cost you your life, give Jesus such proof of your
   love as His Spirit suggests to you! Or is it that you ought to speak to
   people about their souls? The Lord will throw somebody in your way.
   Give a proof of your love by a holy bravery and speak right out for
   Jesus Christ and do not be ashamed. The Lord invites you to a closer
   fellowship with Himself, to come higher up the mount of God and to be
   more thoroughly consecrated. Then show Him the proof of your love!

   I leave this with you. If you love Him, show it! If you do not love
   Him, tremble! I will not repeat what the Scripture says, as though it
   came from myself, but I would have you remember it. Paul says, "If any
   man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema
   maranatha"--cursed with a curse at the coming of Christ. So it must be
   if you love not Christ. Oh, if you love Him, be inventive! Think of a
   new thing that nobody else ever did for Jesus! Strike out a fresh path.
   Deny yourselves comforts to have the comfort of proving your love, as
   His Spirit shall guide and help you. And to His name be praise
   evermore. Amen and Amen.

The Royal Prerogative

   (No. 1523)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 15, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto God the Lord
   belong the issues from death. But God shall wound the head of His
   enemies and the hairy scalp of such an one as goes on still in his
   trespasses." Psalm 68:20,21.

   WHATEVER may be said of the Old Testament dispensation, however dimly
   it may have revealed certain Truths of God, there was one matter about
   which it was clear as the sun. Under the Old Testament economy the Lord
   God of Israel is always most conspicuous. God is in all and over
   all--and from the pages of the Prophets, as well as from the lips of
   the temple choirs, we hear loudly sounding forth the note--"The Lord
   shall reign forever, even your God, O Zion, unto all generations.
   Hallelujah!" By priest and Prophet, saint and Seer, the one testimony
   is borne, "The Lord reigns." You cannot read the Book of Job without
   trembling in the majestic Presence of the Almighty. Nor can you turn to
   the Psalms without being filled with solemn awe as you see David and
   Asaph and Heman adoring the Lord who made Heaven and earth and the sea.

   Everywhere, from Abraham to Malachi, man is of small account and God is
   All in All. Very little consideration is given to any fancied rights
   and claims of man and wonder is expressed that the Creator should be
   mindful of him. We read no discourse upon the dignity of human nature,
   or upon the beauty of human character, but rather God, alone, is holy
   and when He looks from Heaven He sees none that does good, no, not one!
   Man is rolled in the dust from which he sprang and to which he must
   return. All his pride is cut down and his comeliness withered and over
   all is seen one God and none beside Him.

   It will be a great offense if, coming into the brighter light of the
   New Testament, we are less vivid in our conceptions of the Glory of
   God. If God should be less clearly seen in the Person of our Lord Jesus
   than He was under the symbols of the Law, it will be the fault of our
   blinded hearts. It will be ill for us to turn day into night and, like
   owls, see less because the light is increased! Let it not be so among
   us, but let it be in our Churches as in Israel of old, of which it was
   said, "in Judah is God known. His name is great in Israel." "God, who
   at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in times past unto the
   fathers by the Prophets, has, in these last days spoken unto us by His
   Son," and by Him, as the Incarnate Word, He has revealed Himself with a
   sevenfold splendor and, therefore, it should be our soul's great
   delight to perceive God in all things--to rejoice in His Presence and
   to magnify Him in all things as King of kings and Lord of lords!

   The Psalmist, in this particular case, ascribes to the Lord universal
   action and power over us, for he ascribes to Him the mercies of life
   and the issues of death. He says, "Blessed is the Lord who daily loads
   us with benefits." The Lord heaps up His favors till their number loads
   the memory and their value burdens the shoulders of gratitude. He gives
   us so many mercies that the mind is burdened in endeavoring to
   calculate their worth! We are overwhelmed with a sense of His goodness
   and the consciousness that we cannot return any adequate thanks for
   such abundance of daily Grace. Such is our God in life and what will He
   be in death? Shall we be without Him there?

   No, blessed be His name, "Unto God the Lord belong the issues from
   death." His kingdom includes the land of death-shade and all the
   borders thereof. We shall not die without His permission, nor without
   His Presence! Though temporal mercies will find their end when life
   ends, yet there are eternal mercies which throughout eternal life shall
   manifest the goodness of the Most High. And meanwhile, by rescues,
   recoveries and escapes, we shall be preserved from prematurely
   descending to the tomb. If any of you, dear Friends, have been brought
   near to the gates of death; if you have been laid low by wearisome
   sickness; if your heart has sunk within you in a sort of mental death,
   you will, in coming back to health and strength, most heartily bless
   the Lord who finds for us a way of return from the suburbs of the
   sepulcher!

   He is not only the God of life but the God of death. He keeps us in
   life and makes life happy. He keeps us from death and from the fierce
   agencies which wait to drag us to the grave. There are issues out of
   the dark border-land of sickness and peril and despair--and the Lord
   leads us by His own right hand to cause us to escape. Does He not say,
   "I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring My people again from the
   depths of the sea"? We must and we will praise Him for this with a new
   song! I gather from our text that death is in the hand of God; that
   escapes from death are manifestations of His Divine power and that He
   is to be praised for them.

   The outline of this morning's discourse, as indicated by the text, is
   just this--first, the sovereign prerogative of God, "To God the Lord
   belong the issues from death." Secondly, the Character of the Sovereign
   with whom this prerogative is lodged, "He that is our God is the God of
   salvation." And then, thirdly, the solemn warning which this great
   Sovereign gives in reference to the exercise of His prerogative.
   Weighty are the words! May the Holy Spirit cause us to feel their
   power--"God shall wound the head of His enemies and the hairy scalp of
   such an one as goes on still in his trespasses."

   I. First, then, with deep reverence, let us speak upon THE SOVEREIGN
   PREROGATIVE OF GOD--"Unto God

   the Lord belong the issues from death." Kings have been accustomed to
   keep the power of life and death in their own hands. The great King of
   kings, the Sovereign Ruler and absolute Lord of all worlds reserves
   this to Himself--that He shall permit men to die, or shall give them an
   issue or escape from death at His own good will and pleasure. He can
   alike create and destroy. He sends forth His Spirit and they are
   created and at His own pleasure He says, "Return, you children of men,"
   and lo, they fall before Him like autumn's faded leaves!

   The prerogative of life or death belongs to God in a wide range of
   senses. First of all, as to natural life we are all dependent upon His
   good pleasure. We shall not die until the time which He appoints, for
   the time of our death, like all our time, is in His hands. Our skirts
   may brush against the portals of the sepulcher and yet we shall pass
   the iron gate unharmed if the Lord is our Guard. The wolves of disease
   will hunt us in vain until God shall permit them to overtake us. The
   most desperate enemies may waylay us, but no bullet shall find its
   billet in any heart unless the Lord allows it. Our life does not even
   depend upon the care of angels, nor can our death be compassed by the
   malice of devils. We are immortal till our work is done! We are
   immortal till the immortal King shall call us Home to the land where we
   shall be immortal in a still higher sense.

   When we are most sick and most ready to faint into the grave, we need
   not despair of recovery, since the issues from death are in Almighty
   hands. "The Lord kills and makes alive: He brings down to the grave and
   brings up." When we have passed beyond the skill of the physician, we
   have not passed beyond the succor of our God, to whom belong the
   escapes from death. Spiritually, too, this prerogative is with God. We
   are by nature under the condemnation of the Law on account of our sins
   and we are like criminals tried, convicted, sentenced and left for
   death. It is for God, as the great Judge, to see the sentence executed,
   or to issue a free pardon, according as He pleases! And He will have us
   know that it is upon His supreme pleasure that this matter depends.

   Over the head of a universe of sinners I hear this sentence thundering,
   "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion
   on whom I will have compassion." Shut up for death, as men are by
   reason of their sins, it rests with God to pardon whom He wills--none
   have any claim to His favor and it must be exercised upon mere
   prerogative because He is the Lord God, merciful and gracious and He
   delights to pass by transgression and sin. So, too, does the Lord
   deliver His own believing people from those "deaths often" which make
   up their experience. Though we are delivered in Christ Jesus from death
   as a penalty, yet we often feel an inward death caused by the old
   nature which exercises a deadening influence within us. We feel the
   sentence of death in ourselves that we may not trust in ourselves, but
   in Jesus, in whom our life is hid.

   It may be that for a season our joys are dampened, our spiritual vigor
   is drained away and we hardly know whether we have any spiritual life
   left within us. We become like the trees in winter whose substance is
   in them but the sap ceases to flow and there is neither fruit nor leaf
   to betray the secret life within. We scarcely feel a spiritual emotion
   in these sad times and dare not write ourselves among the living in
   Zion! At such times the Lord can give us back the fullness of life!
   Only He can restore our soul from the pit of corruption and cause us
   not only to have life but to have it more abundantly. The escapes from
   death are with the quickening Spirit and when our soul cleaves to the
   dust He can revive us, again, till we rejoice with unspeakable joy!

   As the climax of all, when we shall actually come to die and these
   bodies of ours shall descend into the remorseless grave, as probably
   they will--in the hands of our Redeeming Lord are the escapes from
   death! The archangel is even now waiting for the signal--one blast of
   his trumpet shall suffice to gather the chosen from all lands--from the
   east and from the west, from the south and from the north! Then Death,
   itself, shall die away and the righteous shall arise--

   "From beds of dust and silent clay To realms of everlasting day."

   "I am the Resurrection and the Life," says Christ, and He is both of
   these to all His people. Is He not Life, for He says, "Whoever lives
   and believes in Me shall never die"? Is He not Resurrection, for He
   says, "He that believes in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live"?
   That bright illustrious day in which the saints shall rise with their
   Lord will show how unto God, the Lord, belong the escapes from death!

   Our translation is a very happy one, because it bears so many
   renderings and includes not only escape from death, deliverance from
   condemnation, revival from spiritual death and uplifting from deadly
   mental depression, but recovery from death's direct havoc by our being
   raised again from the tomb! In all these respects the Lord Jesus has
   the key of death--He opens and no man shuts--He shuts and no man opens.
   Concerning this prerogative we may say, first, that to God belongs the
   right to exercise it. This right springs, first, from His being our
   Creator. He says, "all souls are Mine." He has an absolute right to do
   with us as He pleases, seeing He has made us and not we ourselves. Men
   forget what they are and boast great things, but truly, they are but as
   clay on the potter's wheel and He can fashion them or can break them as
   He pleases. They don't think so, but He knows their thoughts that they
   are vain.

   Oh the dignity of man! What a theme for a sarcastic discourse! As the
   frog in the fable swelled itself till it burst asunder, so does man, in
   his pride and envy against his Maker, who, nevertheless, sits upon the
   circle of the heavens and reckons men as though they were grasshoppers
   and regards whole nations of them as the small dust of the balance! The
   Lord's prerogative of creation is manifestly widened morally by our
   forfeiture of any consideration which might have arisen out of
   obedience and rectitude if we had possessed them. Our fault has
   involved forfeiture of the creature's claims, whatever they may have
   been. We are all guilty of high treason and we have, each one, been
   guilty of personal rebellion and, therefore, we have not the rights of
   citizens, but lie under sentence of condemnation.

   What says the Infallible Voice of God? "Cursed is everyone that
   continues not in all things that are written in the Book of the Law to
   do them." We have come under this curse--Justice has pronounced us
   guilty and by nature we abide under condemnation. If, then, the Lord
   shall be pleased to deliver us from death, it rests with Him to do so,
   but we have no right to any such deliverance, nor can we urge any
   argument which would avail in the courts of justice for reversal of
   sentence or stay of execution! Before the bar of justice our case must
   go hard if we set up any plea of not-guilty. We shall be driven away
   with the disdain of the impartial Judge if we urge our suit upon that
   line! Our wisest course is to appeal to His mercy and to His Sovereign
   Grace, for there, alone, is our hope.

   Understand me clearly--if the Lord shall suffer us all to perish, we
   shall only receive our just deserts and we have not, one of us, a shade
   of claim upon His mercy--we are, therefore, absolutely in His hands and
   to Him belong the escapes from death. This right of God to save is
   further made manifest by the redemption of His people. It might have
   been said that God had no right to save if, by saving, He would abridge
   His justice. But now that He has laid help upon One that is mighty and
   His only-begotten Son has become a Victim in our place--to magnify the
   Law and make it honor-able--the Lord God has an unquestionable right to
   deliver from death His own redeemed for whom the Substitute has died!
   Our God saves His people in consistency with justice--no one can
   question His doing right even when He justifies the ungodly. His right
   and power over the escapes from death are, in the case of His own
   blood-bought ones, clear as the sun at noon and who shall dispute with
   Him?

   Our text, however, puts the prerogative upon the one sole ground of
   lordship and we prefer to come back to that. "Unto God the Lord belong
   the issues from death." It is a doctrine which is very unpalatable in
   these days, but one, nevertheless, which is to be held and taught--that
   God is an absolute Sovereign and does as He wills. The words of Paul
   may not be suffered to sleep--"No, but O man, who are you that replies
   against God? Shall the thing formed say to Him that formed it, why have
   You made me thus?" The Lord cannot do wrong. His perfect Nature is a
   law unto itself! In His case Rex is Lex--the King is the Law! He is the
   Source and Fountain of all right, truth, rule and order. Being
   absolutely perfect within Himself and comprehending all things, it is
   not possible for Him to do otherwise than right. He is Good-

   ness, Truth and Righteousness itself and, therefore, the prerogatives
   of His Throne are not bound and to the Lord of Heaven and earth belong
   the issues from death!

   Enough with regard to that matter of right. I go on to notice that the
   Lord has the power of this prerogative. With Him is the ability to
   deliver men from natural death. Jehovah Rophi is a Physician who is
   never baffled. Medicines may fail, but not the great Maker of all
   plants and herbs and useful drugs! Study and experience may be at a
   nonplus, but He who fashioned the human frame knows its most intricate
   parts and can soon correct its disorders! God can restore when a
   hundred diseases are upon us all at once. Take courage, you fainting
   ones and look up! Certainly, as to the soul, there is no case of man so
   far gone that God cannot find an issue out of its death. He can cast
   out seven devils and a legion of diabolical sins! To God, the Lord,
   belong the issues from death, however foul the sin and however forlorn
   the condition caused by transgression. He who raised Lazarus from the
   grave after four days can raise the most corrupt from the grave of
   their iniquities. O that awakened sinners would believe this!

   I remember reading of an aged minister who had, for some years, fallen
   into deep despondency. He gave up his pulpit and kept himself very much
   alone, always writing bitter things against himself. At last, when he
   was on his sick bed, a servant of God was sent to him who dealt wisely
   with him. This good man said to the despairing one, "Brother, do you
   believe that passage, 'He is able, also, to save them to the uttermost
   that come unto God by Him'?" "I believe it," he said, "with all my
   heart, but I am convinced"--here the other stopped him. "I do not ask
   what your convictions may be, nor what your feelings may be, but I come
   to say to you that the man who trusts that promise lives." This plain
   declaration of the Gospel was made, by the Divine Comforter, the means
   of supreme consolation to the despairing one!

   May it be equally useful to all those who hear it. He who can hang his
   soul's hope upon the infinite ability of Christ to save, is a saved
   man! He that believes on Him has everlasting life! What a blessing this
   is! The devil may tell me that I can never escape out of deserved death
   and that I am shut up forever under the just results of my trespasses.
   My own conscience, knowing my undeservingness, may also condemn me a
   thousand times over! But unto God, the Lord, belong the escapes from
   death and He can and will pluck me from between the jaws of death since
   I believe in Him! He is able to bring up those whom He ordains to save
   even from the utmost depths of despair!

   The absolute right of God is supported by almighty power and thus His
   prerogative is made a matter of fact. Nor is this all--the Lord has
   actually exercised this prerogative in abundant cases. As to those
   issues from death which are seen in restoration from sickness, I need
   not remind you that these are plentiful enough. At times these have
   come in a miraculous form, as when Hezekiah had his life lengthened in
   answer to prayer and when many others were healed by the Savior and His
   Apostles. Life has been preserved in a lion's den and in the belly of a
   fish; in a fiery furnace and in the heart of the sea. Death has no
   arrow in his quiver which can hurt the man whom God ordains to live!
   Out of imminent peril the Lord still delivers in the ordinary course of
   Providence and there are persons present, this morning, who are proofs
   of His interposing power. He has raised some of us from prostration of
   body and depression of spirit. He has rescued others from shipwreck and
   fire in very singular ways and here we are, living to praise God, as we
   do this day!

   God has exercised this prerogative spiritually. In what a myriad of
   cases has He delivered souls from death! Ask yon white-robed hosts in
   Heaven, "Has not God displayed in you His sovereign power to save?" Ask
   many here below who have tasted that He is gracious and they will tell
   you, "He saved me." According to His mercy He has issued a free pardon,
   signed by His royal hand, saying, "Deliver him from going down into the
   Pit, for I have found a Ransom." Why His sovereignty has interposed to
   rescue us from death we cannot tell. We often ask, "Why was I made to
   hear His voice? How was it that I was chosen to live?" But we are
   silent with grateful wonder and invent no answer! Divine will, backed
   by Divine power, worked out the sovereign purpose of love and here we
   are, saved from so great a death by love invincible. Yes, indeed, to
   God the Lord belong the escapes from death!

   Come, then, Brothers and Sisters, let Him have all the glory for it! If
   you are alive after a long sickness, bless the Lord, who forgives all
   our iniquities, who heals all our diseases! If you are saved from
   condemnation this morning and know it, bless the Lord who accepts us in
   the Beloved! If you feel, at this moment, that the death of sin has no
   dominion over you, for the life of Grace reigns within, then bless the
   Lord who has quickened you into newness of life! Glorify His name this
   day, who, in love to your soul, has delivered you from the pit of
   corruption and cast all your sins behind His back! Once more, if you
   have a glorious hope of a blessed resurrection and feel that you can
   smile on death because God smiles on you, then bless the Lord who will
   raise you up at the last day! Your Redeemer lives and you shall live
   because

   He lives! Therefore clap your hands with holy glee! Bless the
   all-glorious name of Him to whom belong the issues or escapes from
   death!

   II. Thus have I set forth the prerogative. And now, secondly, follow me
   with your thoughts while I show THE CHARACTER OF THE SOVEREIGN in whom
   that prerogative is vested. We cannot, upon this earth, exhibit much
   love to human princes who claim absolute dominion. Imperialism is not
   to our mind. Among the worst curses that have ever fallen upon mankind
   have been absolute monarchs--nowadays men shake them off as Paul shook
   off the viper into the fire. The Lord grant we may see the last of all
   despotic dynasties and that the nations may be free. We cannot endure a
   tyrant and yet if we could have absolutely perfect despots, it might be
   the best possible form of government.

   Assuredly, the great and eternal God, who is King of kings and Lord of
   lords, is absolutely perfect and we may be well content to leave all
   prerogatives and vest all powers in His hands. He has never trampled on
   the rights of the meanest, nor forgotten the weakest. His foot does not
   needlessly crush a worm, nor does He beat down a fly in wantonness. He
   has never done a wrong, nor worked an injustice. We oppress each other,
   but the Judge of all oppresses none! The Lord is holy in all His ways
   and His mercy endures forever and the amplest prerogatives are safely
   lodged in such hands.

   Our text yet further tells us who it is in whose hands the issues of
   life and death are left--"He that is our God is the God of salvation."
   Sinner, your salvation rests with God, but do not, therefore, be
   discouraged, for that God with whom the matter rests is the God of
   salvation, or of, "salvations," for so the Hebrew has it. What do we
   mean by this? The Scripture signifies, first, that salvation is the
   most glorious of all God's designs. Since this world was made, the
   working out of salvation has run through its story like a silver
   thread. The Lord made the world and lit up moon and stars and set
   Heaven, earth and sea in order with His eyes upon salvation in the
   whole arrangement. He has ruled all things by His supreme government
   with the same end.

   The great wheels of His Providence have been revolving these 6,000
   years before the eyes of men and among them. And at their back a hand
   has been always passing to conduct every movement to the ultimate issue
   which is the salvation of the covenanted ones! This is the object which
   is dearest to Jehovah's heart. He loves best to save! God was pleased
   with Creation, but not as He is with Redemption. When He made the
   heavens and the earth it was everyday work to Him. He merely spoke and
   said, "It is good." But when He gave His Son to die to redeem His
   people and His elect were being saved, He did not speak with the
   prosaic brevity of creation--He sang! Is it not written, "He shall rest
   in His love, He shall rejoice over you with singing"?

   Redemption is a matter which Jehovah sings about! Are you able to
   imagine what it must be for God to sing? For Father, Son and Holy
   Spirit to burst forth into a joyous hymn over the work of salvation?
   This is because salvation is dearest to God's heart and in it His whole
   Nature is most intensely engaged. Judgment is His strange work, but He
   delights in mercy! He has put forth many attributes in the
   accomplishment of other works, but in this He has laid out all His
   Being. He is seen in this as mighty to save. Herein He has bared His
   arm. For this He has taken His Son out of His bosom. For this He has
   caused His Only-Begotten to be bruised and put to grief. Salvation is
   the eternal purpose of the inmost heart of God and by it His highest
   Glory is revealed! This, then, is the God to whom belong the issues
   from death--the God whose grandest design is salvation! Sing unto His
   name and exult that the Lord reigns, even the Lord who is my strength
   and my song, who also has become my salvation.

   If you ask, again, what this means--"He that is our God is the God of
   salvation"--we remind you that the most delightful works which the Lord
   has performed have been works of salvation. To save our first parents
   at Eden's gate and give them a promise of victory over the serpent was
   joy to God. To house Noah in the ark was also His pleasure. The
   drowning of a guilty world was necessary, but the saving of Noah was
   pleasant to the Lord our God. He destroyed the earth with His left
   hand, but with His right hand He shut in the only righteous ones He
   found. To save His people is always His joy--He goes about it eagerly!
   He rode upon a cherub and did fly, yes, He did fly upon the wings of
   the wind when He came to deliver His chosen! What noise He makes about
   His saving work at the Red Sea! The whole Scripture is full of
   allusions to the great salvation out of Egyptian bondage and even in
   Heaven they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God and the song of
   the Lamb.

   The Old Testament seems to ring with the note, "Sing unto the Lord for
   He has triumphed gloriously, the horse and his rider has He thrown into
   the sea." The Lord did greatly rejoice to make a way through the
   wilderness and a path through the deeps for His own people that He
   might work salvation for them in the midst of the earth. Afterwards, in
   the

   Old Testament, how well they keep the records of salvations! They tell
   us of the kings that oppressed the people, but how lovingly they linger
   over the way in which God redeemed Israel from her adversaries. What a
   note of joy there is about Goliath slain and the son of Jesse bearing
   his gory head and Israel delivered from Philistia's vaunts! Well did
   they say, "He that is our God is the God of salvation." He takes
   delight in deeds of Grace--these are His enjoyments. These are His
   recreations. He comes out in His royal robes and puts on His crown
   jewels when He rises to save His people and, therefore, His servants
   cry aloud, "O bless our God, you people, and make the voice of His
   praise to be heard; which holds our soul in life and suffers not our
   feet to be moved."

   This, then, is the God in whom is vested all sovereignty over the
   issues from death. He takes pleasure, not in the destruction, but in
   the salvation of the sons of men! Where could the prerogative be better
   laid up? "He that is our God is the God of salvation," also means that
   at this present time the God who is preached to us is the God of
   salvation. We live, at this moment, under the dispensation of mercy.
   The sword is sheathed, the scales of justice are put away. Those scales
   are not destroyed and that sword is not broken, nor even blunted, but,
   for a while, it slumbers in its scabbard. Today over all our heads is
   held out the silver scepter of eternal love. The angelic carol, first
   heard by shepherds at Bethlehem, lingers, still, in the upper air, if
   you have ears to hear it--"Glory to God in the highest and on earth
   peace, good will toward men."

   The mediatorial reign of Christ is that of multiplied salvations. "Come
   unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you
   rest" is the saving proclamation of the reigning God! The God of the
   Christian age is the God of salvation. He is set forth before us as
   coming to seek and to save the lost! He dwells among us by His abiding
   Spirit, not as a Judge punishing criminals, but as a Father receiving
   His wandering children to His bosom and rejoicing over them as once
   dead but now alive! God in Christ Jesus, our God and Savior Jesus
   Christ, is He who quickens whom He will and is ordained to give eternal
   life to as many as the Father has given Him. Where else could all power
   be more safely laid up?

   Once more, "He that is our God is the God of salvation" means this,
   that to His covenanted ones, to those who can call Him, "our God," He
   is specially and emphatically the God of salvation. There is no
   destruction for those who call Him, "our God," for, "there is therefore
   now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus." Jesus came not
   to condemn the world, but that the world, through Him, might be saved.
   "This God is our God forever and ever. He will be"--our destroyer? No,
   "He will be our Guide even unto death." This God is our Sun and Shield
   and He will give Grace and glory. Now, mark well this fact--we who
   believingly call the Lord, "our God," this morning will tell you that
   we are saved entirely through the Sovereign Grace of God and not
   through any natural betterness of our own, nor through anything that we
   have done to deserve His favor.

   It was because He looked upon us with pity and kindly regard when we
   were dead in sin that, therefore, we live! When we were lying in our
   blood and in our filthiness, He passed by in the time of love and He
   said to us, "Live." If He had passed by and left us to die, He would
   have been infinitely just in doing so, but His heart was otherwise
   inclined. He looked on us and said, "Live," and we lived and we bless
   His name that we are still living and praising His eternal and infinite
   mercy! He who says, "I kill and I make alive, I wound and I heal," is
   He who has quickened us, though we were dead in trespasses and sins!
   Surely, He who has exercised His prerogative so kindly towards us may
   be trusted to exercise it towards all who come to Him according to His
   gracious invitation! If there is any man who says, "I rejoice in the
   election of God, because, although He has saved me, He has left others
   to perish," I desire to have no sympathy with his spirit.

   My joy is of a far different kind, for I argue that He who saved such
   an unworthy one as I am will cast out none that come to Him by faith!
   His election is not narrow, for it comprehends a number that no man can
   number, yes, all that will believe in Jesus! He waits to be gracious
   and he that comes to Him, He will in no wise cast out. The wedding
   feast needs countless guests and every seat must be filled. We wish
   that all the human race would come and accept the provisions of
   infinite Love and we are anxious to go into the highways and hedges and
   compel them to come in! We rejoice to know that if any man is shut out
   from Christ and hope, he shuts himself out, though at the same time we
   feel that if any man is shut in, he did not shut himself in, but
   undeserved Grace worked out his salvation. Justice rules in
   condemnation, but Grace reigns in salvation!

   In salvation we must ascribe all to Grace, absolutely and unreservedly.
   There must be no stammering over this Truth of God! Some begin to say
   Grace, but they do not come out with the word--they stutter it into,
   "free will." This will

   never do! This is not according to the teaching of Holy Scripture, nor
   is it in accordance with fact. If there is any man here who thinks that
   he has been saved as the result of his own will, apart from the
   powerful Grace of God, let him throw his hat up and magnify himself
   forever. "Glory be to my own good disposition!" But as for me, I will
   fall at the foot of the Throne of God and say, "Grace reigns through
   righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ. Had You, O God, left
   me to my own free will, I had continued, still, to despise Your love
   and to reject Your mercy."

   Surely, all the people of God agree that this is the fact in their own
   case, however they may differ theoretically from the general statement.
   Yes, the prerogative of life and death is in good hands--it is in the
   hands of Him who is the God of our salvation and I beseech everyone
   here present who is not saved to be encouraged to bow before the Throne
   of the great King and sue for mercy of Him who is so ready to save! Go
   home and try to merit salvation and you will waste your efforts.! Go
   about to fit yourself for mercy and to fashion some good that may
   attract the notice of God and you will fool yourselves and insult the
   majesty of Heaven!

   But come just as you are, all guilty, empty, meritless and fall before
   the great King whom you have so often provoked and beseech Him, of His
   infinite mercy, to blot out your transgressions, to change your nature
   and to make you His own and see if He will cast you away! Is it not
   written, "There is forgiveness with You, that You may be feared"? And
   again, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out." His Throne is
   a Throne of Grace! Mercy is built up forever before Him! He is the Lord
   God, merciful and gracious, slow to anger and plenteous in mercy! Did
   ever a penitent sue for pardon at His sovereign feet to be rejected?
   Never! Nor shall such a case happen while the earth remains.

   If you try to purchase His favor, you shall be refused. If you claim it
   as a right, you shall be rejected. But if you will come and accept
   salvation of the Divine charity and receive it through the Atonement of
   Christ Jesus, the Lord will find for you an escape from death! Hear the
   witness of Jeremiah and be encouraged to cast yourself before the
   Lord--"I called upon Your name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon. You
   have heard my voice. Hide not Your ear at my breathing, at my cry. You
   drew near in the day that I called upon You--You said, fear not. O
   Lord, You have pleaded the causes of my soul; You have redeemed my
   life."

   III. Our last duty is to hear THE SOLEMN WARNING OF OUR SOVEREIGN LORD.
   A new god has been lately

   set up among men, the god of modern Christianity, the god of modern
   thought, a god made of honey or sugar. He is all leniency, gentleness,
   mildness and indifferent in the matter of sin. Justice is not in him
   and as for the punishment of sin, he knows it not. The Old Testament,
   as you are no doubt made aware by the wise men of this world, takes a
   very harsh view of God and, therefore, modern wisdom sets it on one
   side. Indeed, one half the Word of God is out of date and turned to
   waste paper!

   Although our Lord Jesus did not come "to destroy the Law or the
   Prophets," but to fulfill them, yet the advanced thinkers of these
   enlightened times tell us that the idea of God in the Old Testament is
   a false one. We are to believe in a new god who does not care whether
   we do right or wrong! By his arrangement all will come to the same end
   in the long run. There may be a little twisting about for awhile for
   some who are rather incorrigible, but it will all come right at last.
   Live as you like! Go and swear and drink. Go and oppress the nations
   and make bloody wars and act as you will. By jingo, you will be all
   right at last! This is roughly the modern creed which poisons all our
   literature.

   But let me say by Jehovah--this shall not be as men dream! Jehovah, the
   Judge of all the earth, must do right. The God of Abraham and of Isaac
   and of Jacob is the God of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ--the God of
   the whole earth shall He be called. He has not changed one whit in the
   stern integrity of His Nature and He will, by no means, spare the
   guilty! Read, then, the last verse of our text and believe that it is
   as true today as when it was first written and that if Jesus Himself
   were here, the meek and lowly One would say it in tones of tearful
   solemnity, but He would utter it, none the less--"God shall wound the
   head of His enemies and the hairy scalp of such an one as goes on still
   in his trespasses."

   It is clear from these words that God is not indifferent to human
   character. Our God knows His enemies. He does not mistake them for
   friends, nor treat them as such. He regards iniquity as a trespass and,
   therefore, He has not broken down the boundaries of Law, nor the hedges
   of right--there are still trespasses and God perceives them and notes
   them down and such as go on in their trespasses are trying His
   longsuffering and provoking His justice! God sleeps not, neither does
   He wink at human sin, but calls upon all men everywhere to repent! And
   it is clear, too, that God has the power to smite those who rebel
   against Him.

   Dream not of natural laws which will screen the wicked--"He shall wound
   the head of His enemies." They may lift up those heads as high as they
   please, but they cannot be beyond the reach of His hands! He will not
   merely bruise their heels, or wound them on the back with blows which
   may be healed--but at their heads He will aim fatal blows and lay them
   in the dust. He can do it and He will! They may be very strong and
   their scalp covered with hair may indicate unabated strength, but they
   cannot resist Omnipotence! There may be no sign, as yet, of the
   baldness which comes of weakness, or of the scantiness of hair which is
   a token of old age--but vain are they who boast of vigor, for in their
   prime He can cause them to wither as the grass of the field!

   The proud may vaunt themselves of their beauty--their hairy scalp, like
   that of Absalom, may be their boast--but as the Lord made the hair of
   Absalom to be the instrument of his doom, so can He make the glory of
   man to be his ruin. Pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit
   before a fall. No man is out of the reach of God and no nation, either!
   The great ones stand on high upon their lofty places and they talk
   about the "vulgar crowd," and despise the godly of the land. As for
   foreign races, how lightly are they esteemed, though one God has made
   them all! Populations and nations, what are they? Mere food for powder
   when a proud nation is set upon its own aggrandizement. Overturn their
   kingdoms, slaughter their patriotic defenders, redden the earth with
   blood, burn their houses, starve their women and children. Does God
   know and is there judgment in the Most High?

   We are a great people, and have the men, the ships and the money. Who
   shall call us to account? Yet let the still small voice be heard! Thus
   said the Lord to a great nation of old, "You have trusted in your
   wickedness: you have said, None sees me. You have said in your heart, I
   am and none else beside me. Therefore shall evil come upon you; you
   shall not know from where it rises: and mischief shall fall upon you;
   you shall not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon you
   suddenly, which you shall not know." From such chastisements, good
   Lord, deliver us! When the Lord puts His hands to the work of
   vengeance, His smiting will be terrible, even an utter overthrow, for
   it will be a smiting upon the head!

   If He does not smite His enemies until the hour of death, what a blow
   will they then receive! They boasted of their self-righteousness, or of
   their greatness but, oh, what terror will seize them when, at the last
   moment, while they dream of Heaven, they are thrown down into the
   unfathomable deep where woe shall be the everlasting reward of their
   daring rebellion against their King! Warriors of old times would, when
   they went to battle, often shave off all their hair except those locks
   which are on the back part of the scalp. Yet when they turned to flee
   it frequently happened they were grasped by their pursuers by their
   flowing hair! God does not often take the wicked by the forelock, for
   He has great patience and bears with them. In special cases, as when
   young men through dissipated habits hasten on their doom, He takes them
   in front--but as a rule He waits in mercy. And yet He suffers them not
   to go unpunished, for at the last, He seizes their hairy scalp. If for
   fourscore years infinite Patience should permit a man to continue in
   his rebellion, yet if he goes on in his trespasses, at the very last
   God shall thrust His hand into his hairy scalp and grasp him to his
   destruction!

   Turn you, yes, you that know not God! Turn you at His rebuke this
   morning, for the rebuke is meant in love! And if I have used hard
   words, it is because my heart is honestly anxious that you would repent
   and escape to Him who has in His power the escapes from death! I am not
   like yon flatterers who tell you that there is a little hell and a
   little god, from which they naturally infer that you may live as you
   like. Both you and they will perish everlastingly if you believe them!
   There is a dreadful Hell, for there is a righteous God!

   Turn you to Him, I entreat you, while yet, in Christ Jesus, He sets
   mercy before you! He is the God of salvation and entreats you to come
   and accept of His great Grace in Christ Jesus. The Lord bless this word
   according to His own mind and unto Him be praise forever and ever.
   Amen.

Your Personal Salvation

   (No. 1524)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 22, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Receiving the end of your faith--the salvation of your souls. Of this
   salvation the Prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who
   prophesied of the Grace that would come to you, searching what, or what
   manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did indicating,
   when He testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glories
   that would follow. To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but
   to us they did minister the things which are now reported to you by
   them that have preached the Gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent down
   from Heaven--which things angels desire to look into." 1 Peter 1:9-12.

   "Let Your mercies come also unto me, O Lord, even Your salvation,
   according to Your Word."

   Psalm 119:41

   THESE two texts will be, to me, as a bow and a sword--the first for
   shooting the arrows of the Truth of God and the second for close
   quarters in dealing with individual consciences. You will see the
   reason for the pair of texts as we proceed. May the Holy Spirit make
   use of both according to His own mind. Last Sabbath I preached upon the
   God of salvation [#1523--The Royal Prerogative]--this morning our
   principal objective is to speak of that salvation, itself. I then tried
   to show that God is always the same and that the God of the Old
   Testament, unto whom belongs the issues, or escapes from death, is
   still the God of our salvation.

   My first text runs upon the same line, for it teaches us that the
   Prophets of old, who spoke by the power of the Holy Spirit, testified
   concerning the same salvation which has been reported to us by the
   Apostles as actually accomplished. There has been no new salvation!
   There has been a change in the messengers, but they have all spoken of
   one thing and, though their tidings have been more clearly understood
   in these latter days, the substance of the good news is still the same.
   The Old Testament and the New are one, inspired by the same Spirit and
   filled with the same Subject, namely, the one promised Messiah.

   The Prophets foretold what the Apostles reported. The Seers looked
   forward and the Evangelists look backward-- but their eyes meet at one
   place--they see eye to eye and both behold the Cross. I shall aim, this
   morning, at commending the salvation of God to those of you who possess
   it, that you may be the more grateful for your choice inheritance. But
   I will still more labor to commend it to those who possess it not, that
   having some idea of the greatness of its value, they may be stirred up
   to seek it for themselves. Ah, my unsaved Hearers, how great is your
   loss in missing the salvation of

   God!

   "How shall you escape if you neglect so great a salvation?" O that you
   might be rescued from such folly! Perhaps God the Holy Spirit will show
   you the preciousness of this salvation and then you will no longer
   neglect, despise, or refuse it, but will offer the prayer which I have
   selected as a sort of second text and entreat the Lord to let His
   mercies come to you, even His salvation. The prayer may be helpful in
   enabling you to take with you words and turn to the Lord. God grant it
   may be so!

   I. First, I shall in much simplicity, with a vehement desire for the
   immediate conviction and salvation of my hearers, try to COMMEND THE
   SALVATION OF GOD by opening up what Peter has said in the verses before
   us. Let me urge you to give earnest heed to the salvation of God,
   because it is a salvation of Grace. The 10th verse says, "Of this
   salvation the Prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who
   prophesied of the Grace that would come to you." Salvation is
   altogether of Grace--Grace which comes from God in His mercy to man in
   his helplessness! The Gospel does not come to

   you asking something of you, but its hands are laden with gifts more
   precious than gold which it freely bestows upon guilty men. It comes to
   us, not as a reward for the obedient and deserving, but as a merciful
   gift for the disobedient and undeserving.

   It deals with us, not upon the ground of justice, but upon terms of
   pure mercy. It asks no price and exacts no purchase. It comes as a
   benefactor, not as a judge. In the Gospel, God gives liberally and
   upbraids not. We are accustomed not only to say, "Grace," but, "Free
   Grace." It has been remarked that this is a tautology. So it is, but it
   is a blessed one, for it makes the meaning doubly clear and leaves no
   room for mistakes! Since it is evidently objectionable to those who
   dislike the doctrine intended, it is manifestly forcible and,
   therefore, we will keep to it. We feel no compunction in ringing such a
   silver bell twice over--Grace, Free Grace! Lest any should imagine that
   Grace can be otherwise than free, we shall continue to say, not only
   Grace, but Free Grace, so long as we preach!

   You are lost, my dear Hearer, and God proposes your salvation, but not
   on any ground of your deserving to be saved, else the proposal would
   most assuredly fall to the ground in the case of many of you--I might
   have said in the cases of us all, though some of you think not. The
   Lord proposes to save you because you are miserable and He is merciful!
   Because you are needy and He is bountiful. Why, I think every man who
   hears this good news should open both his ears and lean forward, that
   he may not lose a word! Yes, and he should open his heart, too, for
   salvation by Grace is most suitable to all men and they need it
   greatly.

   Only give intimation that goods are to be had free and your shop will
   be besieged with customers! Those who want us to notice their wares are
   often crafty enough to put at the head of their advertisement what is
   not true, "To be given away." But salvation's grand advertisement is
   true--salvation is everything for nothing--pardon free, Christ free,
   Heaven free! "Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price."
   Our good Physician has none but gratis patients. Since the gifts which
   the God of All Grace grants to sinful men are beyond all price, He does
   not barter and dicker with them, but makes His blessings free as air! I
   am sure that if you feel yourselves to be guilty, the very idea of
   being saved by Grace will have a charm for you. To a thirsty man, the
   sound of a rippling stream is music and to a convicted conscience, free
   pardon is as rivers of water in the wilderness! Oh, that all the world
   would listen when we have such a message to tell!

   Again, your closest attention may well be asked to the salvation of God
   when you are told in the text that it is by faith. "Receiving the end
   of your faith--the salvation of your souls." Salvation is not obtained
   by painful and humiliating penances. Nor by despondency and despair.
   Nor by any effort, mental or spiritual, involving a purchase by labor
   and pain. It is entirely and only by faith, or trust, in the Lord
   Jesus! Do you ask--"Is it really so, that salvation is by believing,
   simply believing?''" Such is the statement of the Word of God! We
   proclaim it upon the guarantee of Infallible Scripture! "All that
   believe are justified from all things from which they could not be
   justified by the Law of Moses." "Whoever believes that Jesus is the
   Christ is born of God." "He that believes in Him is not condemned." "He
   that believes on Him has everlasting life."

   These are a mere handful of proof texts gleaned from wide fields of the
   same kind. "Repent and believe the Gospel," is our one plain and simple
   message. We cry again and again, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and
   you shall be saved." "Believe only," and, "Jesus only," are our two
   watchwords! Now, it is singularly foolish that men should quibble at
   this which ought to please them! What? Shall it be that the Gospel
   shall be regarded as too easy a thing? Will men quarrel with Mercy for
   being too generous? If there is a condition, is it wisdom on our part
   to contend with God because that condition seems to be too slight? What
   would you have for a condition? Would you have it proclaimed that men
   must be saved by works?

   Which among you would, then, be saved? Your works are imperfect and
   full of evil! The Law cannot justify you, it condemns you! As long as
   you are under the Law, has not the Holy Spirit declared that you are
   under the curse? Ought you not, you sons of men, bless God that
   salvation is of faith that it might be by Grace and that it might be
   possible to you and sure to all the seed? The sinner cannot keep the
   Law of God--he has already broken it most terribly and he is, himself,
   enfeebled and depraved by the Fall. Adam did not stand when he was in
   his perfection--what shall we do who are ruined by his fall and full of
   evil?

   By the Grace of God the sinner can believe in Jesus! This is ceasing
   from his own power and merit and leaving himself in his Savior's hands.
   Salvation by faith thus sets an open door before those whom the Law
   shuts out! It is in every way

   adapted to the case of the guilty and fallen--and such characters
   should hasten to accept salvation thus presented to them! O my God, how
   is it that this message does not, at once, awaken all who hear it to an
   eager acceptance of Your salvation? O that the Spirit of God would make
   these appeals powerful with you! The Gospel of salvation ought to be
   regarded by you, for it has engrossed the thoughts of Prophets! The
   text says, "Of this salvation the Prophets have inquired and searched
   diligently, who prophesied of the Grace that would come to you."

   Those great men, the choice spirits of the ages which they adorned,
   were delighted to preach of this salvation as a blessing to be
   hereafter revealed! They did not, themselves, altogether understand
   what they were called to reveal, for the Holy Spirit often carried them
   beyond themselves and made them utter more than they understood. The
   Inspiration of the Bible is verbal Inspiration. In some cases it must
   have been only verbal--in every case it must have been mainly so! The
   human mind is not able to understand and to express all the thoughts of
   God, they are too sublime and, therefore, God dictated to the Prophets
   the very language which they should deliver--language of which they,
   themselves, could not see the far-reaching meaning.

   They rejoiced in the testimony of the Spirit within them, but they were
   not free from the necessity to search and to search diligently, if they
   would, for themselves to derive benefit from the Divine Revelation. I
   know not how this is, but the fact is clearly stated in the text and
   must be true. Oh, my Hearers, how diligently you ought to search the
   Scriptures and listen to the saving Word of God! If men that had the
   Holy Spirit and were called, "Seers," nevertheless searched into the
   meaning of the Word of God which they, themselves, spoke, what ought
   such poor things as we are to do in order to understand the Gospel?

   It should be our delight to read, mark, learn and inwardly digest the
   Doctrines of Grace. Surely it must be a crime of crimes to be living in
   utter neglect of a salvation which gained the attentive mind of Daniel
   and Isaiah and Ezekiel! O that the long list of great and holy men
   would have some weight with thoughtless ones! I would cause a noble
   line of Prophets to pass before you this morning that you may see how
   many of them spoke of Christ and His salvation. From Abel, whose blood
   cried from the ground, down to him who spoke of the Sun of
   Righteousness and His Resurrection-- they all spoke in Jehovah's name
   for your sakes! From Moses down to Malachi, all of these lived and many
   of them died that they might bear witness to "the Grace that would come
   to you."

   They, themselves, were, no doubt saved. But still, the full
   understanding and enjoyment of the Truth was reserved for us! Unto them
   it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us, they ministered the
   things of God! They lighted lamps to shine for future ages! They told
   of a Christ who was actually to come in later days to work out His
   Redemption after they had all died in faith without a sight of His
   actual coming! You and I live in the light of a finished salvation! God
   has appeared in human flesh! Christ has borne the guilt of man! His
   Atonement is complete! Jesus has risen from the dead and gone into
   Glory pleading for Believers!

   Surely that which Prophets thought worth their while to study night and
   day, though they knew that they would never see it, ought to be thought
   worthy of the devout attention of those immediately concerned in it! If
   Daniel set his face, by prayer and study--in fasting and in
   loneliness--to search out the salvation of the future, we ought at once
   to seek for the salvation which is now present among us! If Isaiah
   spoke with a golden tongue as the very Chrysostom of the old
   dispensation; if Jeremiah wept, like a Niobe, rivers of tears; if
   Ezekiel, despite the splendor of his princely intellect, was almost
   blinded by the splendor of his visions--if the whole goodly fellowship
   of the Prophets lived and died to study and to foretell the great
   salvation--we ought to give most earnest heed to it! If they pointed us
   to the Lamb of God and, according to the best of their light, foretold
   the coming of the Redeemer, then woe unto us if we trifle with Heaven's
   message and cast its blessings behind our backs! By all the Prophets
   whom the Lord has sent, I beseech you, give His salvation a hearty
   welcome and rejoice that you have lived to see it!

   Furthermore, when prophecy had ceased, the Holy Spirit came upon
   another set of men of whom our text speaks. Peter says of these things,
   that they "are now reported to you by them that have preached the
   Gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent down from Heaven." The Apostles
   followed the Prophets in testifying to this salvation and with the
   Apostles there was an honorable fellowship of earnest Evangelists and
   preachers. I will not stay to point out to you the admirable character
   of these men, but I would beg you to observe that, having personally
   seen Christ Jesus for themselves, they were not deceived. Many of them
   had eaten and drank with Him--all the Apostles had done so--they had
   been with Him in familiar conversation and they were resolute in
   bearing witness that they had seen Him after He had risen from the
   dead.

   These men spoke with the accent of conviction! If they were duped,
   there certainly never was another instance of such persons and so many
   of them being so utterly deluded. They continued throughout all their
   lives to bear hardships and to endure reproaches for the sake of
   bearing witness to what they had seen and heard--and all the Apostles
   but one died a martyr's death rather than allow the slightest suspicion
   to be cast upon the truth of their report! The text says that they
   reported these things when they preached the Gospel by the Holy Spirit
   sent down from Heaven. I see them going everywhere preaching the Word
   of God!

   They were dressed in no robes but those of poverty. They had no
   distinctions but those of shame and suffering. They had no power but
   that of the Holy Spirit. I hear them fearlessly lifting up their voices
   among a warrior population, or gently testifying in peaceful homes.
   They evangelized the open country and they instructed the capital
   itself--Caesar's household hears of them! I see them far away among the
   Parthians and Scythians telling the barbarians that there is salvation
   and that Jesus has accomplished it! With equal joy I see them telling
   cultured Greeks that God was in Christ a Man among men and that the
   Incarnate God died in man's place that believing men might be delivered
   from the wrath of God and from the plague of sin.

   These noble bearers of glad tidings continued to report this salvation
   till they had finished their missions and their lives and, therefore, I
   feel that for us, in these times, to trifle with God's Word and give a
   deaf ear to the invitations of the Gospel is an insult to their honored
   memories! You martyr them a second time by contemptuously neglecting
   what they died to hand to you! From the dead they bear witness against
   you and when they rise again they will sit with their Lord to judge
   you! Nor have we merely Prophets and Apostles looking on with wonder,
   but our text says, "Which things angels desire to look into."

   We know very little of these heavenly beings. We do know, however, that
   they are pure spirits and that the elect angels have not fallen into
   sin. These beings are not concerned in the Atonement of Christ so far
   as it is a ransom for sin, seeing as they have never sinned--they may,
   however, derive some advantage from His death, but of that we cannot
   now speak particularly. They take such an interest in us, their fellow
   creatures, that they have an intense wish to know all the mysteries of
   our salvation. They were pictured, you know, upon the Ark of the
   Covenant as standing upon the Mercy Seat and looking down upon it with
   steady gaze. Perhaps Peter was thinking of this holy imagery. They
   stand intently gazing into the marvel of Propitiation by blood!

   Can you quite see the beauty of this spectacle? If we knew that a door
   was opened in Heaven, would not men be anxious to look in and see
   Heaven's wonders? But the case is here reversed, for we see a window
   opened towards this fallen world and heavenly beings looking down upon
   the earth, as if Heaven, itself, had no such Object of attraction as
   Christ and His salvation! Watts sang not amiss when he gave us the
   verse--

   "Archangels leave their high abode

   To learn new mysteries here and toll

   The love of our descending God,

   The glories of Immanuel."

   Paul tells us that to principalities and powers in the heavenly places
   shall be made known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God. For men
   to be lessons to angels, books for seraphs to read, is a strange fact!
   Perhaps the angelic enquirers ask such questions as this--How is God
   just and yet the Justifier of the ungodly? At first it must have been,
   I think, a wonder that He who said, "In the day you eat thereof you
   shall surely die," could have permitted man to live on and to have a
   hope of eternal life.

   How could He who says that He will by no means clear the guilty yet
   bestow His favors upon guilty men? Angels wonder as they see how,
   through the Substitution of Jesus Christ, God can be sternly just and
   yet abundantly gracious! And while they learn this, they long to
   discover more of the Truth of God wrapped up in the one great
   Sacrifice--they peer and pry and search and consider and, therefore,
   the doctrines of the Gospel are spoken of as "things which the angels
   desire to look into."

   Now think--if these glorious spirits who need not to be
   redeemed--intently gaze upon the Redeemer, should not we, also, desire
   to look into the mysteries of His death? O men and women, is it nothing
   to you that the Son of God should give His life as a ransom for many?
   If these spotless ones marvel at that sacred bath of blood by which sin
   is washed away, will not you, who are covered with defilement, stop
   awhile to see the Lord whose flowing veins afford such purging? I think
   if I saw an angel intently gazing upon any object, if I were a
   passerby, I should stop and look, too. Have

   you never noticed in the streets that if one person stands still and
   looks up, or is occupied with gazing into a shop window, others become
   curious and also look? I would enlist that faculty of curiosity which
   is within every man and prompt you to search with the angels as they
   pry into the underlying meaning of the fact and doctrine of Atonement!

   They stand at the foot of the Cross ravished, astounded, yes, all
   Heaven to this day has never ceased its amazement at the dying Son of
   God made sin for men! And will none of you spare an hour to look this
   way and see your best Friend? Shall it be that time out of mind we must
   come into our pulpits and talk of Christ to deaf ears and speak to our
   fellow men about the Grace which is brought to them, only to find that
   they treat it as an old wives' fable or a story with which they have
   nothing to do? Ah, my careless Hearer, I wish you were in the same
   plight as I was in once when I was burdened with a sense of my
   transgressions. If you felt as I did, you would grab that word,
   "Grace," right eagerly and be delighted with the promise made to
   "faith."

   You would make up your mind that if Prophets searched out salvation; if
   Apostles reported it; if angels longed to know it, you yourself would
   find it or perish in searching after it! Do you forget that you must
   have eternal life or you are undone forever? Do not trifle with your
   eternal interests! Do not be careless where earth and Heaven are in
   earnest! Prophets, Apostles, angels all beckon you to seek the Lord!
   Awake, you that sleep! Arise, O sluggish soul! A thousand voices call
   you to bestir yourself and receive the Grace which has come to you!

   We have already gone a long way with this text, rising step by step. We
   have stood where angels gaze. Now behold another wonder--we rise beyond
   them to the angels' Master. Christ is the substance of this salvation!
   For what says the text? The Prophets spoke "beforehand of the
   sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow." Ah, there is
   the point! To save men Jesus suffered. The Manhood and the Godhead of
   Christ endured inconceivable anguish! All through His life our Lord was
   "a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief." His was the bravest heart
   that ever lived and the gentlest spirit that ever breathed, but the
   most crushed and downtrodden! He went from one end of our heavens to
   the other like a cloud of sympathy, dropping showers of blessing.

   All the trials of His people He carried in His heart and all their sins
   pressed heavily upon His soul--His daily burden of care for all His
   people was such as none can sympathize with to the fullest, even though
   like He they have kept the flock of God. I have sometimes had intense
   sympathy with Moses--I hope I am not egotistical in comparing small
   things with great--when he cried, "Why have You afflicted Your servant?
   And why have I not found favor in Your sight, that You lay the burden
   of all this people upon me? Have I conceived all this people? Have I
   begotten them, that You should say to me, Carry them in your bosom as a
   nursing father bears the sucking child, to the land which You swore
   unto their fathers? I am not able to bear all this people alone because
   it is too heavy for me."

   But what was the care of the tribes in the wilderness on Moses' heart
   compared with the myriads upon myriads that lay upon the heart of
   Christ, a perpetual burden to His spirit? The sufferings of His life
   must never be forgotten, but they were consummated by the agonies of
   His death. There was never such a death! Physically it was equal in
   pain to the sufferings of any of the martyrs. But its peculiarity of
   excessive grief did not lie in His bodily sufferings--His
   soul-sufferings were the soul of His sufferings! Martyrs are sustained
   by the Presence of their God, but Jesus cried, "My God, My God, why
   have You forsaken Me?" That cry never came up from the stakes of
   Smithfield, or from the agonies of the Spanish torture chambers, for
   God was with His witnesses! But He was not with Christ! Here was the
   depth of His woe!

   Now, I pray you, if you will manifest some sign of thought and
   softness, remember that if the Son of God became a man so that He might
   suffer to the death for men, it is astonishing that men should turn
   deaf ears to the salvation which He accomplished! I hear from His Cross
   His sad complaint, "Is it nothing to you, all you that pass by? Behold
   and see if there was ever sorrow like My sorrow, which is done to Me."
   Oh, if you are born of woman and have a heart that has any flesh about
   it, think well of the salvation, "the Grace, which is brought unto
   you," by the sufferings of the Son of God! One other step remains. It
   cannot be higher--it is on the same level and I beseech you to stand
   upon it and think a while, you that have thought so little of
   yourselves and of your God.

   It is this. The Holy Spirit is the witness to all this. It was the Holy
   Spirit that spoke in the Prophets. It was the Holy Spirit who was with
   those who reported the Gospel at the first. It is the same Holy Spirit
   who every day bears witness to Christ. Do you not know that we still
   have miracles in the Christian Church? Scoffers come to us and say,
   "Work a miracle and we will believe you." We work miracles every day!
   Had you been present at a meeting held here last month you would have
   heard something not far short of one hundred persons, one after
   another, assert that by the preaching of the

   Gospel in this place lately, their lives have been completely changed.
   In the case of some of these the change is very obvious to all persons
   acquainted with them.

   How was this great change achieved? By the Holy Spirit through the
   Gospel of your salvation! But I need not quote those special cases.
   There are many here who would tell you, if this were the time to speak,
   where they used to spend their Sundays and what was their delight. All
   things have become new with them. They now seek after holiness as
   earnestly as they once pursued evil! Though they are not what they want
   to be, they are not what they used to be. They never thought of purity
   or goodness, or anything of the kind, but they loved the wages of
   unrighteousness and now they loathe the things they once loved! I have
   seen moral miracles quite as marvelous in their line as the healing of
   a leper or the raising of the dead! This is the witness of the Holy
   Spirit which He continues to bear in the Church and, by that witness I
   entreat you to stop and think of the blessed salvation which can work
   the same miracle in you.

   From the first day in which man fell--when the Holy Spirit, at the
   gates of Eden presented the Gospel in the first promise--all down the
   prophetic ages and then by Christ and by His Apostles and onward by all
   the men whom God has sent, since, to speak with power, the Holy Spirit
   entreats you to consider Christ and His salvation! To this end He
   convinces the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment to
   come--that men may turn unto the salvation of God and live forever! By
   the Spirit of the living God I entreat you, dear Hearers, to neglect no
   longer the great salvation which has won the admiration of all holy
   beings and has the seal of the Triune God upon its forefront!

   II. So far I have commended my Lord's salvation and now I would desire
   you, with all this in your minds, to turn to the prayer in the 119th
   Psalm--"Let Your mercies come also unto me, O Lord, even Your
   salvation, according to Your Word." Use the prayer with this
   intent--Lord, I have been hearing what Prophets and Apostles and angels
   think of Your salvation. What Your Son and what Your Spirit think of
   it. Now let me humbly say what I think of it--Oh that it were mine! Oh
   that it would come to me! This, then, is my second head. I would
   RECOMMEND THE PRAYER OF

   THE PSALMIST.

   I will say about it, first, that it is, in itself, a very gracious
   prayer, for it is offered on right grounds. "Let Your mercies come also
   unto me." There is no mention of merit or desert. His entreaty is only
   for mercy. He pleads guilty and throws himself upon the prerogative of
   the King who can pardon offenders. Are you willing, my dear Hearer, you
   who have never sought the Savior--are you willing at this moment to
   stand on that ground and to ask for salvation as the result of mercy?
   You shall have it on such terms, but you can never be saved until you
   will acknowledge that you are guilty and submit to Justice.

   Observe the plural, "Let your mercies come unto me," as if David felt
   that he needed a double share of it, yes, a sevenfold measure of it!
   Elsewhere he cried, "According unto the multitude of Your tender
   mercies blot out my transgressions." Our sense of sin leads us to use
   similar language. Lord, I need much mercy, manifold mercy, multiplied
   mercy! I need mercy upon mercy! I need forgiving mercy! I need
   regenerating mercy! I need mercy for the present as well as for the
   past and I shall need mercy to keep me in the future if I am to be
   saved at all! Friend, set your plea on that ground! Multiplied sins
   crave multiplied mercies. "Let Your mercies come also unto me, O Lord."

   It is a gracious prayer, because it asks for the right thing--"Your
   salvation"--not a salvation of my own invention, but, "Your salvation."
   God's salvation is one in which His Divine Sovereignty is revealed and
   that Sovereignty must be accepted and adored. Do not dispute against
   God's salvation, but accept it in its entirety, just as it is revealed.
   Receive the salvation which the Lord planned in eternity--which He
   worked out on Calvary and which He applies to the heart by the Holy
   Spirit. You need salvation from sinning as well as salvation from Hell
   and the Lord will give you that. You need salvation from self to God
   and that, too, He will bestow. Ask for all that the Lord intends by His
   salvation and includes in it. "Let Your mercies come also unto me, even
   Your salvation."

   You see, dear Brothers and Sisters, that the prayer is put in the right
   form, for it is added, "Even Your salvation according to Your Word." He
   wishes to be saved in the manner which the Lord has appointed. Dear
   Hearer, where are you? Are you hidden away in the foggy corners? I wish
   I could get a hold of your hand and speak as a Brother to you. You do
   not want God to go out of the way of His Word to save you, do you? You
   are willing to be saved in the Scriptural way, the Biblical way! People
   nowadays will do anything but keep to the Word of God! They will follow
   any book but the Bible! Now, pray the Lord to give you the salvation of
   the Bible in the Bible's own way.

   Lord, if Your Word says I must repent, give me Your salvation and cause
   me to repent! If Your Word says that I must confess my sin, give me
   Your salvation in the confession of sin! If You say I must trust
   Christ, Lord, help me, now, to trust Him--only grant me Your salvation
   according to Your Word. Observe that the whole prayer is conceived and
   uttered in a humble spirit. It is, "Let Your salvation come also unto
   me." He admits his helplessness. He cannot get at the mercy! He needs
   it to come to him. He is so wounded and so sick that he cannot put on
   the plaster nor reach the medicine and, therefore, he seeks the Lord to
   bring it to him.

   He is like the man half dead on the road to Jericho and needs that
   someone should pour on the oil and wine, for he cannot help himself by
   reason of his spiritual lethargy and death. "Let Your mercies come to
   me, O Lord." This implies that there is a barrier between him and the
   mercy. The road appears to be blocked up. The devil intervenes and his
   fears hedge up the way and he cries to God to clear the road. "Lord,
   let Your mercies come! Did you not say, Let there be light and there
   was light? So let Your mercy come to me, a poor dying sinner and I
   shall have it, Lord! But it must come to me by Your power. Lo, here I
   lie at Hell's dark door and feel within my spirit as if the sentence of
   condemnation were registered in Heaven against me! But let Your mercies
   come also unto me, O God, even Your salvation, according to Your Word."
   That is a very gracious prayer.

   In the second place this prayer may be supported by gracious arguments.
   May the Spirit of God help you to plead them. I will suppose some poor
   heart painfully longing to use this prayer. Here are arguments for you.
   Pray like this. Say, " Lord, let Your mercy come to me, for I need
   mercy." Do not go on the tack of trying to show that you are good,
   because mercy will then pass you by. To argue merit is to plead against
   yourself! Whenever you say, "Lord, I am as good as other people. I try
   to do my best," and so on, you act as foolishly as if a beggar at your
   door should plead that he was not very badly off, not half so needy as
   others and neither scantily fed nor badly clothed. This would be a new
   method of begging and a very bad one!

   No, no! State your case in all its terrible truthfulness. Say, "O Lord,
   I feel that nobody in all this world needs Your mercy more than I do!
   Let my need plead with You! Give me Your salvation. I am no impostor, I
   am a sinner--let Your mercy and Your Truth visit me in very deed." Your
   soul's wounds are not such as sham beggars make with chemicals-- they
   are real sores--plead them with the God of all Grace! Your poverty is
   not that which wears rags abroad and fine linen at home--you are
   utterly bankrupt and this you may urge before the Lord as a reason for
   His mercy.

   Next plead this--"Lord, You know and You have made me to know somewhat
   of what will become of me if Your mercy does not come to me--I must
   perish, I must perish miserably! I have heard the Gospel and have
   neglected it. I have been a Sabbath-breaker, even when I thought I was
   a Sabbath-keeper. I have been a despiser of Christ, even when I stood
   up and sang His praises, for I sang them with a hypocrite's lips. The
   hottest place in Hell will surely be mine unless Your mercy comes to
   me. Oh, send that mercy, now." This is good and prevalent
   pleading--hold on to it.

   Then plead, "If Your mercy shall come to me, it will be a great wonder,
   Lord. I have not the confidence to do more than faintly hope it may
   come, but, oh, if You ever do blot out my sins I will tell the world of
   it! I will tell the angels of it! Through eternity I will sing Your
   praises and claim to be, of all the saved ones, the most remarkable
   instance of what Your Sovereign Grace can do! Do you feel like that,
   dear Hearer? I used to think if the Lord saved me He would have begun
   on a new line altogether--that His mercy would have sent up her song an
   octave higher than before! In every man's case there will be a
   conviction that there is a something so special about his guilt that
   there will be something very special about the mercy which can put that
   guilt away.

   Plead, then, the peril of your soul and the Glory which Grace will gain
   by your rescue. Plead the greatness of the Grace needed, for Christ
   delights to do great marvels and His name is Wonderful. "Lord, pardon
   my iniquity, for it is great. Lord, save me, for I am a nobody and it
   will be a wonder, indeed, if Your Grace shall visit me." Then you can
   put this to the good Savior. Tell Him if He will give you His
   salvation, He will not be impoverished by the gift. "Lord, I am a
   thirsty soul, but You are such a River that if I drink from You there
   will be no fear of my exhausting Your boundless supply." They put up
   over certain little nasty, dirty ponds by the roadside, "No dogs may be
   washed here." Pity the dogs if they were!

   But no one puts up such a notice on the banks of great, glorious Old
   Father Thames! You may wash your dogs if you like and his flood will
   flow on! There is too much of it to be so readily polluted. So is it
   with the boundless mercy of God! God permits many a poor dog of a
   sinner to be washed in it and yet it is just as full and efficacious as
   ever! You need not

   be afraid of enjoying too much sunlight, for the sun loses nothing by
   your basking in his beams. So is it with Divine Mercy--it can visit you
   and bless you and remain as great and glorious as ever! Out of the
   fullness of Christ millions may still receive salvation and He will
   remain the same overflowing Fountain of Grace! Plead, then, "Lord, if
   such a poor soul as I shall be saved, I shall be made supremely happy,
   but none of Your attributes or glories shall be one jot the less
   illustrious! You will be as great and blessed a God as ever."

   You may even say, "Lord, now that Your Son Jesus has died, it will not
   dishonor You to save me. Before the atoning Sacrifice it might have
   stained Your Justice to pass by sin, but now that the Sacrifice is
   offered, You can be just and yet the Justifier. Lord, none shall say
   You are unjust if You save even me now that Jesus Christ has bled.
   Since You have made my salvation possible without infringement of Your
   Law, I beseech You fulfill the design of the great Sacrifice and save
   even me!" There is another plea implied in the prayer and a very sweet
   argument it is--"Let Your mercies come also unto me, O Lord." It
   means--"It has come to so many before, therefore let it also come unto
   me. Lord, if I were the only one and You had never saved a sinner
   before, yet would I venture upon Your Word and promise! Especially
   would I come and trust the blood of Jesus! But, Lord, I am not the
   first by many millions. I beseech You, then, of Your great love, let
   Your salvation come unto me."

   You notice in the parable of the prodigal that the forlorn feeder of
   swine was the only son that had gone astray and consequently the first
   that ever tried whether his father would receive him. The elder brother
   had not gone astray and was there at home to grumble at his younger
   brother. But the poor prodigal son, though he had no instance before
   him of his father's willingness to forgive, was bold to try, by faith,
   his father's heart! None had trod that way before, yet he made bold to
   explore it! He felt that he should not be cast out. But when we hear
   any of you say, "I will arise and go to my Father," scores of us are
   ready to leap out of our seats and cry, "Come along, Brother, for we
   have come and the gracious Father has received us!"

   I do not know whether the elder brother is here to murmur at a penitent
   sinner. I am happy to say I have none of his spirit. It will make my
   heart happy! The bells of my whole nature will ring for joy if I may
   only bring one of my poor, prodigal brothers back to my great Father's
   house! Oh, come along with you and let this be the plea--"You have
   received so many, O receive me!" Cry, "Bless me, even me, also, O my
   Father!" The Lord has not come to the end of His mercy. Jesus has not
   come to the end of His saving work. There is room for you and there
   will be room for thousands upon thousands until the Master of the house
   has risen up and shut the door. He has not risen up, nor closed the
   door as yet and still His mercy cries, "Come to Me! Come to Me! Come to
   Me and he that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out."

   I will close by assuring you that this blessedly gracious prayer which
   I have helped to back up with arguments will be answered by our
   gracious God. Oh, be sure of this! He never sent His Prophets to preach
   to us a salvation which cannot be ours! He never sent His Apostles to
   report to us concerning a mere dream! He never set the angels wondering
   at an empty speculation! He never gave His Son to be a Ransom which
   will not redeem and He never committed His Spirit to witness to that
   which will, after all, mock the sinner's need! No, He is able to
   save--there is salvation--there is salvation to be had, to be had now,
   even now!

   We are sitting in the light in this house while a dense fog causes
   darkness all around, even darkness which may be felt. This is an emblem
   of the state of those who are in Christ--they have light in their
   hearts, light in their habitations, light in Jesus Christ! O come to
   Him and find salvation now! May God bring any that have been in
   darkness into His marvelous light and bring them now and unto His name
   shall be praise forever and ever! Amen and amen.

The Lily Among Thorns

   (No. 1525)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 29, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "As the lily among thorns, so is My love among the daughters." Song of
   Solomon 2:2.

   WE shall not enter into any profitless discussion this morning. We take
   it for granted that the Song of Solomon is a sacred marriage song
   between Christ and His Church and that it is the Lord Jesus who is here
   speaking of His Church and, indeed, of each individual member, saying,
   "As the lily among thorns, so is My love among the daughters." I will
   not even enter into any study as to what particular flower is here
   intended by the word translated, "lily," for it would be very difficult
   to select a plant from the Holy Land about which travelers and
   botanists would agree. The lily, which we should most naturally fix
   upon, is, as I have gathered from books on travel, not at present found
   in that country, though we may not, therefore, be sure that it was
   never there, or may not yet be discovered. Several other fair and
   beautiful forms, according to the fancies of various travelers, have
   been preferred to occupy the place of the plant intended by the
   original Hebrew, but none of them quite come up to the ideal suggested
   to an English reader by our translation.

   I will for once take the liberty to clothe the Scripture in a Western
   dress, if necessary, and venture to do what Solomon would surely have
   done if his Song of Songs had been written in England. I shall assume
   that he means one of our own lilies--either the lily of the valley, or
   one of those more stately beauties, matchless for whiteness--which so
   gloriously adorn our gardens. Either will do and serve our purpose this
   morning. "As the lily among the thorns, so is My love among the
   daughters." It is of small moment to be precise in botany so long as we
   get the spirit of the text. We seek practical usefulness and personal
   consolation and proceed at once in the pursuit, in the hope that many
   are taking root among us, now, newly transplanted from the world.

   It is well that they should be rooted in a knowledge of their calling
   by Grace and what it includes. They ought to know, at the commencement,
   what a Christian is when he is truly a Christian; what he is expected
   to be; what the Lord means him to be and what the Lord Jesus regards
   him as really being! In that way they may make no mistakes, but may
   count the cost and know what it is that they have ventured upon.
   Thinking over this subject carefully and anxiously desiring to warn our
   new converts without alarming them, I could not think of any text from
   which I should be able, in the exposition of it, to better set forth
   the position, condition and character of a genuine Christian.

   Jesus Himself knows best what His own bride is like--let us hear Him as
   He speaks in this matchless song! He knows best what His followers
   should be and well may we be content to take the words out of His own
   mouth when, in sweetest poetry, He tells us, "As the lily among thorns,
   so is My love among the daughters." Join me then, my Brothers and
   Sisters, at this time, in considering how our Lord's lilies grow!
   Concerning the Church of God, there are two points upon which I will
   enlarge. First, her relation to her Lord and secondly, her relation to
   the world.

   I. First, I think my text very beautifully sets forth THE RELATION OF
   THE CHURCH AND OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL TO CHRIST. He styles her, "My love."
   An exquisitely sweet name, as if His love had all gone forth of Him and
   had become embodied in her. The first point, then, of her relation to
   Christ is that she has His love. Think of it and let the blessed Truth
   of God dwell long and sweetly in your meditations! The Lord of life and
   glory, the Prince of the kings of the earth has such a loving heart
   that He must have an object upon which to spend His affections--and His
   people, chosen from among men, whom He calls His Church--these are they
   who are His "love," the object of His supreme delight! "Christ loved
   the Church and gave Himself for it."

   He looked on His people and He exclaimed, "as the Father has loved Me,
   even so have I loved you." Every Believer, separated from mankind and
   called into the fellowship of Christ, is also the peculiar object of
   His love. Not in name only, but in deed and in truth does Jesus love
   each one of us who have believed on Him. You may, each one of you, say
   with the Apostle, "He loved me." You may read it in any tense you
   please--He loved me; He loves me; He will love me, for He gave

   Himself for me. This shall be your song in Heaven, "Unto Him that loved
   us and washed us from our sins in His own blood, to Him be glory." Let
   your hearts saturate themselves with this honeyed thought! Heaven lies
   hidden within it! It is the quintessence of bliss--Jesus loves me!

   It is not in the power of words to set forth the charming nature of
   this fact. It is a very simple proposition, but the heights and depths,
   the lengths and breadths of it surpass our knowledge. That such a poor,
   insignificant, unworthy being as I am should be the object of the
   eternal affection of the Son of God is an amazing wonder! Yet,
   wonderful as it is, it is a fact! To each one of His people, He says,
   this morning, by the Holy Spirit, "I have loved you with an everlasting
   love, therefore, with loving kindness have I drawn you." Each one of us
   may rejoice in the title under which our Lord addresses us--"My love."
   This love is distinguishing love, for in its light one special object
   shines as a lily and the rest, "the daughters," are as thorns. Love has
   fixed on its chosen object and, compared with the favored one, all
   others are as nothing. There is a love of Jesus which goes forth to all
   mankind, for "the Lord is good to all and His tender mercies are over
   all His works," but there is a special and peculiar love which He bears
   to His own.

   As a man loves his neighbors but still has a special affection for his
   wife, so is the Church Christ's bride beloved above all the rest of
   mankind and every individual Believer the favored one of Heaven! The
   saint is united to Christ by a mystical union, a spiritual marriage
   bond and, above all others, Christ loves the souls espoused to Him. He
   said once, "I pray for them. I pray not for the world, but for them
   which You have given Me." Thus He indicates that there is a specialty
   about His intercession.

   We rejoice in the largeness and the width of Jesus' love, but we do
   not, therefore, doubt its specialty. The sun shines on all things, but
   when it is focused upon one point, ah, then there is a heat about it of
   which you little dreamed! The love of Jesus is focused on those whom
   the Father has given Him! Upon you, my Brother or Sister, if, indeed,
   you are a believer in Jesus Christ, the Lord's heart is set and He
   speaks of you in the words of the text as, "My love," loved above all
   the daughters! Precious in His sight and honorable so that He will give
   men for you and people for your life.

   Observe that this is a love which He openly avows. The Bridegroom
   speaks and says before all men, "As a lily among thorns, so is My love
   among the daughters." He puts it upon record in that Book which is more
   widely scattered than any other, for He is not ashamed to have it
   published on the housetops! The love of Christ was, at first, hidden in
   His heart, but it soon revealed itself, for even of old His delights
   were with the sons of men and He bent His steps downward to this world
   in many forms before Bethlehem's song was sung. And now, since the
   Incarnate God has loved and lived and died, He has unveiled His love in
   the most open form and astonished Heaven and earth thereby! On Calvary
   He set up an open proclamation, written in His own heart's blood, that
   He loved His own even unto the end.

   He bids His ministers proclaim it to the world's end that many waters
   could not quench His love, neither could the floods drown it--and that
   neither life, nor death, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
   height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us
   from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord! He would have
   it known, for He is not ashamed to call His people, "the bride, the
   Lamb's wife." He declares it so that His adversaries may know it--that
   He has a people in whom His heart delights and these He will have and
   hold as His own when Heaven and earth shall pass away!

   This love, wherever it has been revealed to its object, is
   reciprocated. If the Lord has really spoken home to your soul and said,
   "I have loved you," your soul has gladly answered, "This is my Beloved
   and this is my Friend; yes, He is altogether lovely." For what says the
   spouse in another place? "My Beloved is mine and I am His." I am His
   beloved, but He is my beloved, too. By this, dear Hearer, shall you
   know whether this text belongs to you or not. What do you say when
   Jesus asks of you, "Do you love Me?" Is your heart warmed at the very
   mention of His name? If you can truly say with Peter, "Lord, You know
   all things, You know that I love You," then rest assured you love Him
   because He first loved you. Doubt not the fact, but be well assured of
   it, that love in your heart towards Jesus is the certain and infallible
   pledge of His infinite, eternal and immutable love to you! If His name
   is on your heart, then be sure of this, that your name is on His breast
   and written on the palms of His hands. You are espoused to Him and the
   bands of the mystical wedlock shall never be snapped. This is the first
   point of the relation of the Church to her Lord--she is the object of
   His love.

   Next, she bears His likeness. Notice the first verse of the chapter,
   wherein the Bridegroom speaks--"I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of
   the valleys." He is the lily, but His beloved is like He, for He
   applies His own chosen emblem to her--"As the lily among thorns, so is
   My love among the daughters." Notice that He is the lily and she is as
   the lily--

   that is to say, He has the beauty and she reflects it! She is comely in
   His comeliness which He puts upon her. If any soul has any such beauty
   as is described here, Christ has endowed that beloved soul with all its
   wealth of charms, for in ourselves we are deformed and defiled! What is
   the confession of this very spouse in the previous chapter? She says "I
   am black"--that is, the opposite of a lily. If she adds, "but comely,"
   it is because her Lord has made her comely. There is no Grace but what
   Grace has been given and if we are graceful it is because Christ has
   made us full of Grace. There is no beauty in any of us but what our
   Lord has worked in us.

   Note, too, that He who gave the beauty is the first to see it. While
   they are unknown to the world, Jesus knows His own. Long before anybody
   else sees any virtue or any praise in us, Jesus descries it and is
   pleased with it. He is quick to say, "Behold, he prays," or, "Behold,
   he repents." He is the first to say, "I have surely heard Ephraim
   bemoaning himself." Love's eyes are quick and her ears are open. Love
   covers a multitude of faults, but it discovers a multitude of beauties.
   Can it be, O my Soul? Can it be that Christ has made you comely in His
   comeliness? Has He shed a beauty upon you and does He, Himself, look
   complacently upon it? He whose taste is exquisite and whose voice is
   the Truth of God--who never calls that beautiful which is not
   beautiful--can He see a beauty in your sighs and tears, in your desires
   after holiness, in your poor attempts to aid His cause, in your prayers
   and in your songs and in your heart's love towards Him-- can He see a
   beauty in these? Yes, assuredly He can, or He would not speak as He
   does in this text!

   Let His condescending discernment have all honor for this generous
   appreciation of us. Let us bless and love Him because He deigns to
   think so highly of us who owe every thing to Him. "You are," He says,
   "My love, as the lily." It is evident that the Lord Jesus takes delight
   in this beauty which He has put upon His people. He values it at so
   great a rate that He counts all rival beauties to be but as thorns. He
   looks upon the court of an earthly monarch and sees my lords and
   ladies, but makes small account of them compared with His poor saints!
   If in that court He spies out one that loves Him, one who wears a
   coronet and prays, He marks that one and counts Him or her, "as the
   lily among thorns." There is a wealthy household, honored and famous
   among the old county families, but in it there is no lover of the
   Savior except one and she, perhaps, is a little maid whose service is
   among the pots, yet shall she be as the wings of a dove covered with
   silver. "As the lily among thorns" shall she be!

   All the kingdoms of the earth are but thorns to the Lord Jesus compared
   with His Church. Be they Roman, German, French, or English--all empires
   with all their splendors are mere spines and thorns upon the common
   bramble bushes and thorn coverts--the haunts of wild and noxious
   creatures in the view of the King of kings! But His Church and those
   that make up the body of the faithful are as lilies in His discerning
   eyes! He delights in them! He finds a sweet content in gazing on them!
   So you see the Lord has given to His people His likeness and that
   likeness He looks upon and loves. Bringing out still further the
   relationship between Christ and His Church, I want you to notice that
   her position has drawn out His love. "As the lily," He says, " among
   thorns, so is My love."

   He spied her out among the thorns! She was at first no better than a
   thorn itself--His Grace, alone, made her to differ from the briars
   about her! But as soon as He had put His life and His Grace into her,
   though she dwelt among the ungodly, she became as the lily and He spied
   her out! The thorn thicket could not hide His beloved! Christ's eye
   towards His people is so quick because it is cleared by love. There
   may, at this time, be in a Popish convent one truly seeking Jesus in
   spirit and in truth. He spies out the Believer among the rest who trust
   in themselves and calls her His love among thorns! There may be, at
   this moment, in the most godless haunt in London a poor, trembling
   heart that loves Jesus in secret-- the Lord knows that heart and it is
   to Him as a lily among thorns!

   You, perhaps, are the only serious working man in the shop in which you
   earn your daily bread and the whole band hold you in derision. You may
   hardly know, yourself, whether you are really a Christian, for you are
   sometimes staggered about your own condition--and yet the enemies of
   Christ have made up their minds as to whose you are and treat you as
   one of the disciples of the Nazarene! Be of good courage, your Lord
   discerns you and knows you better than you know yourself! Such is the
   quickness of His eyes that your difficult and perilous position only
   quickens His discernment and He regards you with the more attention.
   The thorns cannot hide you, thickly as they cluster around you--in your
   loneliness you are not alone--the Crucified is with you!

   "As the lily among thorns" wears, also, another meaning. Dr. Thompson
   writes of a certain lily, "It grows among thorns and I have sadly
   lacerated my hands in extricating it from them. Nothing can be in
   higher contrast than the luxuriant, velvety softness of this lily and
   the withered, tangled hedge of thorns about it." Ah, Beloved, you know
   who it was

   that, in gathering your soul and mine, lacerated not His hands only,
   but His feet and His head and His side and His heart--yes and His
   inmost soul! He spied us out and said, "Yonder lily is Mine and I will
   have it," but the thorns were a terrible barrier--our sins had gathered
   round about us and the wrath of God most sharply stopped the way. Jesus
   pressed through all that we might be His and now when He takes us to
   Himself, He does not forget the thorns which girded His brow and tore
   His flesh for our sakes. This, then, is a part of our relationship to
   Christ, that we cost Him very dearly. He saw us where we were and He
   came to our deliverance. And now, even as Pharaoh's daughter called the
   young child's name, Moses, "Because," she said, "I drew him out of the
   water," so does Jesus call His chosen, "the lily among thorns," because
   such she was when He came to her rescue. Never will He forget Calvary
   and its thorns--nor should His saints allow that memory to fade.

   Yet once more I think many a child of God may regard himself as still
   being a lily among thorns because of his afflictions. Certainly the
   Church is so and she is thereby kept for Christ's own. If thorns made
   it hard for Him to reach us for our salvation, there is another kind of
   thorn which makes it hard for any enemy to come at us for our harm. Our
   trials and tribulations, which we would gladly escape from, often act
   as a spiritual protection--they hedge us about and ward off many a
   devouring foe. Sharp as they are, they serve as a fence and a defense.
   Many a time, dear child of God, you would have been an exposed lily, to
   be plucked by any ruthless hand, if it had not been that God had placed
   you in such circumstances that you were shut up unto Himself. Sick
   saints and poor saints and persecuted saints are fair lilies enclosed
   by their pains and needs and bonds that they may be for Christ, alone.

   I look on John Bunyan in prison writing his, "Pilgrim's Progress," and
   I cannot help feeling that it was a great blessing for us all that such
   a lily was shut up among the thorns that it might shed its fragrance in
   that famous book and thereby perfume the Church for ages! You that are
   kept from roaming by sickness or by family trials need not regret these
   things, for perhaps they are the means of making you more completely
   your Lord's. How charmingly Madame Guyon wrote when she was immured in
   a dungeon. Her wing was closely bound, but her song was full of
   liberty, for she felt that the bolts and bars only shut her in with her
   Beloved and what is that but liberty? She sang--

   "A little bird I am,

   Shut from the fields of air.

   And in my cage I sit and sing

   To Him who placed me there.

   Well pleased a prisoner to be,

   Because, my God, it pleases Thee.

   Nought ha ve I else to do,

   I sing the whole day long.

   And He whom most I love to please

   Does listen to my song.

   He caught and bound my wandering wing,

   But still He bends to hear me sing." "As the lily among thorns," she
   lived in prison shut in with her Lord and since the world was quite
   shut out, she was in that respect a gainer! O to have one's heart made
   as "a garden enclosed, a spring shut up, a fountain sealed." So let my
   soul be, yes, so let it be even if the enclosure can only be
   accomplished by a dense growth of trials and grief!

   May every pain that comes and casts us on our bed and lays us aside
   from public usefulness; may every sorrow which arises out of our
   business and weans us from the world; may every adversary that assails
   us with bitter, taunting words, only thicken the thorn hedge which
   encases us from all the world and constrains us to be chaste lilies set
   apart for the Well-Beloved! Enough upon this point, I think, only let
   me entreat all of you who have lately come to know the Lord to think
   much of your relationship to Him. It is the way by which you will be
   supported under the responsibilities of your relationship to the world.
   If you know that you are His and that He loves you, you will be strong
   to bear all burdens. Nothing will daunt you if you are sure that He is
   for you, that His whole heart is true to you, that He loves you
   especially and has set you apart unto Himself that you may be one with
   Him forever!

   Dwell much, in your meditations, upon what this text and other
   Scriptures teach of the relationship of the renewed heart to Christ and
   know Him of whom you are so well known. May the Holy Spirit teach us
   all this lesson so that it may be learned by our hearts.

   II. But now, secondly, our text is full of instruction as to THE
   RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHURCH AND EACH INDIVIDUAL BELIEVER TO THE
   WORLD--"The lily among thorns." First, then, she has incomparable
   beauty. As compared and contrasted with all else, she is as the lily to
   the thorn thicket. Did not our Lord say of the natural lilies--
   "Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these"? And when
   I think of Christ's lilies, adorned in His own righteousness and
   bearing His own image, I feel that I may repeat my Master's words and
   say with emphasis, "Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one
   of these!"

   In Christ's esteem, His Church bears the bell for beauty. She is the
   fairest among women. She is not to be compared--she has to be
   contrasted with the rest of mankind. Our Lord means that if you take
   worldlings at their best and in their bravest attire--in their pomp and
   glory and parade--they are but as thorns in contrast with His Church.
   Though the Church may seem to be little and poor and despised, yet she
   is better than all the princes and kingdoms and glories of the earth!
   He means that true Christians are infinitely superior to ungodly men.
   These ungodly men may make a fair show of virtue and they may have much
   prudence and wit and count themselves wise and great, but Jesus calls
   all unconverted ones, "thorns," while His own believing ones He
   compares to "lilies."

   The thorns are worthless. They flourish and spread and cumber the
   ground, but they yield no fruit and only grow to be cut down for the
   oven. Alas, such is man by nature, at his best. As for the lily, it is
   a thing of beauty and a joy forever. It lives shedding sweet perfume
   and when it is gathered, its loveliness adorns the chamber to which it
   is taken. So does the saint bless his generation while here and when he
   is taken away he is regarded with pleasure even in Heaven above as one
   of the flowers of God! He will, before long, be transplanted from among
   the thorns to the garden enclosed beyond the river, where the King
   delights to dwell, for such a flower is far too fair to be left forever
   amid tangled briars! There are, among worldly people, some who are very
   fair to look upon in many respects--philanthropic, kind and
   upright--they have many virtues. But since these virtues have no
   bearings towards God and no reference to Christ, He counts the bearers
   of them to be but thorns!

   What virtue can there be in him whose principle in life is disregard of
   his Maker and disbelief in his Savior? He is an avowed rebel and yet
   would be commended by the Lord whom he rejects? How can it be? Acts
   done from other motives than those of obedience to God or love to
   Christ are poor things. There may be a great inward difference between
   actions which outwardly are the same. The apple of Nature has never the
   flavor of the pomegranate of Grace! It may seem, even, to excel the
   fruit of Grace, but it is not so. Two babies before us may appear alike
   as they seem to sleep side by side, but the child of Nature, however
   finely dressed, is not the living child and the Lord will not
   acknowledge the dead thing as belonging to His family! Ah, you that are
   struggling after holiness for Christ's sake--you that are seeking after
   virtue in the power of the Holy Spirit--you have the beauty of the
   lily, while all else are still to Christ but as a thicket of thorns.

   Yes, and let me say that I am sorry to add--a real Christian is as
   superior, even, to a professing Christian as a lily is to thorns! I
   know Churches in which there are many who make a profession, but, ah
   me, it is a pity that they should, for their life does not adorn their
   doctrine! Their temper is not consistent with the indwelling of the
   Holy Spirit. They live like worldlings, to amass money, or to carry on
   business, or to enjoy good eating and drinking, or to dress and go to
   parties. They are as much for this world as if they were never renewed
   and it is to be feared they never were! It will often grieve those who
   really love the Lord to see how mere professors pretend to do what
   saints labor to perform.

   Saints are mimicked--I almost said mocked and mimicked--by empty
   professors and this is a standing source of sorrow. Their cold words
   often vex the zealous heart and pierce it as with thorns. When you are
   full of zeal, their lack of consecration almost kindles indignation in
   the minds of those who are willing to give their last penny--yes, and
   their last breath for their Master's honor! Do not, however, be at all
   astonished, for it must be so. He who is full of the Grace of God will
   always be as the lily among thorns, even in the professing church! Do
   not marvel, young Brother, if older professors dampen your ardor and
   count your warm love to be a mere fanaticism! God give you Grace to
   keep up your first love and even to advance upon it, though the thorny
   ones wound and hinder you. May you be distinguished above your fellow
   professors, for I fear that unless it is so, your life will be a poor
   one. This, then, is the relationship of the Church to the world and of
   Christians to the world--that they are as much superior to the
   unregenerate in moral and spiritual beauty as the lily is to the thorns
   among which it finds itself.

   Secondly, in the comparison of the saint to the lily we remark that he
   has, like the lily, a surpassing excellence. I point not to its beauty,
   just now, but to its intrinsic excellence. The thorn is a fruit of the
   curse--it springs up because of

   sin. "Thorns, also, and thistles shall it bring forth unto you." Not so
   the lily--it is a fair type of the blessing which makes rich without
   the sorrow of carking care. The thorn is the mark of wrath and the lily
   is the symbol of Divine Providence. A true Believer is a blessing, a
   tree whose leaves heal and whose fruit feeds. A genuine Christian is a
   living Gospel, an embodiment of goodwill towards men. Did not the old
   Covenant blessing run, "In you and in your seed shall all the nations
   of the earth be blessed"? I cannot refrain from quoting a metrical
   meditation of one who loved the Song of Solomon and drank into its
   spirit. He says of the Church, she is--

   "A radiant thing, where all is gloomy else,

   Florescent where all else is barrenness.

   A blossom in the desert, that proclaims

   Man is no friendless outcast, hopeless doomed

   To traverse scenes of wickedness and grief,

   But, pilgrim as he is, has One who plans,

   Not only to protect but cheer his way!

   Oh, ever testifying desert flower,

   Still holding forth the story of God's love,

   How amazing it is that busy throngs

   Pause not to look on you!

   That few reflect

   On the strange fact of your existence still, A lily among thorns--a
   life in death, Distinct from, yet in contact with the world; Burning,
   yet unconsumed; though cumbered, free With glorious liberty!"

   Yes, the Church is a blessing, a blessing abiding and scattering its
   delights in the midst of the curse--and each particular Believer is, in
   his measure, a blessing, too, "as the lily among thorns."

   A true Christian knows not how to harm his fellow men. He is like the
   lily which stings no one and yet he lives among those who are full of
   sharpness. He aims to please and not to provoke and yet he lives among
   those whose existence is a standing menace. The thorn tears and
   lacerates--it is all armed from its root to its topmost branch, defying
   all comers. But there stands the lily--smiling, not defying--charming
   and not harming! Such is the real Christian--holy, harmless, full of
   love, gentleness and tenderness. Therein lies his excellence. The thorn
   pierces, but the lily soothes. The very sight of it gives pleasure. Who
   would not stop and turn aside to see a lily among thorns and think he
   read a promise from his God to comfort him amid distress? Such is a
   true Christian! He is a consolation in his family, a comfort in his
   neighborhood, an ornament to his profession and a benediction to his
   age.

   He is all tenderness and gentleness and yet it may be he lives among
   the envious, the malicious and the profane. He is a lily among thorns.
   The thorn says, "Keep away! No one shall touch me with impunity." The
   lily cries, "I come to you. I shed my soul abroad to please you." The
   sweet odors of the lily of the valley are well known. Perhaps no plant
   has so strong a savor about it of intense and exquisite sweetness as
   that lily of the valley which is found in Palestine. Such is the
   sanctified Believer. There is a secret something about him, a hallowed
   savor which goes out from his life, so that his gra-ciousness is
   discovered, for Grace, like its Lord, "cannot be hid." Even if the
   regenerate man is not known as a professor, yet does he reveal himself
   by the holiness of his life--"his speech betrays him."

   When I was resting in the south I wandered by the side of a flowing
   stream, gathering handfuls of maiden-hair fern from the verdant
   bank--and as I walked along I was conscious of a most delicious
   fragrance all around me. I cast my eye downward and I saw blue eyes
   looking up from among the grass at my feet. The violets had hidden
   themselves from sight, but they had betrayed themselves by their
   delicious scent. So does a Christian reveal his hidden life. His tone
   and temper and manners speak of his royal lineage, if, indeed, the
   Spirit of God is in him. Such are the people of God--they court no
   observation, but are like that modest flower of which the poet says--

   "She never affects

   The public walk, nor gaze of midday sun. She to no state nor dignity
   aspires, But silent and alone puts on her suit

   And sheds a lasting perfume, but for which We had not known there was a
   thing so sweet Hidden in the gloomy shade."

   I want you, dear Christian people, to be just like this--to have about
   you a surpassing wealth of blessing and an unrivalled sweetness of
   influence by which you shall be known of all men! Is it so with you, or
   are you as rough and stern and repellant as a thorn thicket? Are you as
   selfish and as quarrelsome as the unregenerate? Or do you shed yourself
   away in sweet odors of self-denying kindness in your families and among
   your neighbors? If you do, then does Jesus say of you, "As the lily
   among thorns, so is My love among the daughters."

   The last point with regard to our relationship to the world is that the
   Church and many individual Christians are called to endure singular
   trials which make them feel, "as the lily among thorns." That lovely
   flower seems out of place in such company, does it not? Christ said,
   "Behold, I send you forth as sheep among sheep"--no, no, that is my
   mistake-- "as sheep among wolves." It is a very blessed thing to be as
   sheep among sheep--to lie down with them under the shadow of the great
   rock and feed with them in green pastures under the Shepherd's eyes.
   This is our privilege and we ought to value it greatly and unite with
   the Church and frequent its ordinances. But even then we shall, some of
   us, have to go home to an ungodly family, or to go out into the world
   to win our bread and then we shall be as sheep among wolves.

   Grow in the Church and you will be lilies in the garden, but you cannot
   always live in the Tabernacle and so you will have to go back to the
   ungodly world and there you will be lilies among thorns. The lily
   startles you if you find it in such a position. Often you come upon one
   of God's elect ones in a most unexpected manner and are as much amazed
   as if an angel crossed your path! This is the wonder of the lily among
   thorns. You are making your way over a wild heath and come to a tangled
   thorn thicket through which you must force your way. As you are walking
   through the dense mass, rending and tearing your garments, suddenly you
   stand still as one who has seen a vision of angels, for there, among
   the most rugged brambles, a lily lifts its lovely form and smiles upon
   you!

   You feel like Moses at the back of the desert when he saw the bush
   which burned with fire and yet was not consumed! So have you met in a
   back slum where blasphemy abounded, a beauteous child of God, whom all
   recognized as such and you have felt amazed! So have you, in a wealthy
   family full of worldliness and vanity, come upon a humble man or
   patient woman living unto Christ and you have asked how came this Grace
   to this house? So, too, in a foreign land, where all bowed down to
   crucifixes and image, you have casually met with a confessor who has
   stood his ground among idolaters, declaring for his God, not by his
   speech so much as by his holy walk! The surprise has been great. Expect
   many such surprises!

   The Lord has a people where you look not for them. Think not that all
   His lilies are in His garden! There are lilies among thorns and He
   knows their whereabouts. Many saints reside in families where they will
   never be appreciated any more than the lily is appreciated by the
   thorns. This is painful, for the sympathy of our fellows is a great
   comfort. Lilies of the valley love to grow in clusters and saints love
   holy company and yet, in some cases it must not be--they must live
   alone. Nor need we think that this loneliness is unrelieved, for God
   goes out of the track of men and He visits those whom His own servants
   are passing by. The poet says--

   "Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, And waste its sweetness on
   the desert air." But the poet forgot that God is in the wilderness and
   the solitary place and the sweetness of lonely flowers is His! He who
   planted the lily among thorns sees its beauty! It is God's flower and
   does it waste its sweetness because no human nostril smells it? It were
   blasphemous to count that wasted which is reserved for the great King!

   The Lord understands the incense of Nature better than we do and as He
   walks abroad He rejoices in His works. Grace struggling in loneliness
   is very choice in God's esteem. If man sees you not, O lonely Believer,
   you may nevertheless sing, "You, God, see me." The flower which blooms
   for God alone has a special honor put upon it and so has the saint
   whose quiet life is all for Jesus. If you are unappreciated by those
   around you, do not, therefore, be distressed, for you are honorable in
   the sight of God!

   The lily is altogether unassisted, too, by its surroundings--"the lily
   among thorns" borrows nothing from the growth which gathers about it. A
   genuine Christian is quite unhelped by ungodly men. And what is worse,
   he is cumbered by them. Yet through Divine Grace he lives and grows!
   You know how the good seed could not grow because of the thorns which
   sprang up and choked it, but here is a good seed, a choice bulb, which
   flourishes where you could not

   have looked for it to do so! God can make His people live and blossom
   even among the thorns where the ungodly, by their evil influences,
   would choke and destroy them. Happy it is when the gracious one can
   overtop the thorn thicket which would check his growth and make his
   influence to be known and felt above the grossness of surrounding sin.

   We would not do justice to this text if we failed to see in it a
   reminder of the persecution to which many of the best of God's people
   are subjected. They live all their lives like the lily among thorns.
   Some of you, dear Friends, are in this condition. You can hardly speak
   a word but what it is picked up and made mischief of. You cannot
   perform an action but what it is twisted and motives imputed to you
   which you know not of. Nowadays persecutors cannot drag men to the
   stake, but the old trial of cruel mocking is still continued--in some
   cases it rages even more fiercely than ever. God's people have been a
   persecuted people in all times and you only fare as they fare. Bear
   well the burden common to all the chosen! Make no great wonder of
   it--this bitter trial has happened to many more before--and you may
   well rejoice that you are now in fellowship with Apostles and Prophets
   and honorable men of all ages!

   The lily among thorns should rejoice that it is a lily and not a
   thorn--and when it is wounded it should consider it a matter of course
   and bloom on. But why does the Lord put His lilies among thorns? It is
   because He works transformations, singular transformations, by their
   means. He can make a lily grow among thorns till the thorns grow into
   lilies! Remember how it is written, "The wilderness and the solitary
   place shall be glad for them and the desert shall rejoice and blossom
   as the rose." He can set a Christian in a godless family till first one
   and, then, another shall feel the Divine power and shall say, "We will
   go with you, for we perceive that God is with you." It cannot happen in
   Nature, but it does happen perpetually in Grace--that the sweet perfume
   of the lily Believer, shed abroad upon the thorn thicket of the
   ungodly--turns it into a garden of lilies!

   Such holy work among ungodly people is the truest and best "FLOWER
   MISSION." They do well who give flowers to cheer the poor in their
   dreary habitations, but they do better, still, who are, themselves,
   flowers in the places where they live! Be lilies, my dear Brothers and
   Sisters--preach by your actions! Preach by your kindness and by your
   love! Do this and I feel quite sure that your influence will be a power
   for good. If the Holy Spirit helps all of you to stand among your
   associates as lilies among the thorns, the day will come when thorns
   will die out and lilies will spring up on every side! Then sin will be
   banished and Grace will abound!

   An Australian gentleman told me yesterday that in his colony the arum
   lily abounds as much as weeds do with us. When will this happen
   spiritually on our side of the globe? Ah, when? Blessed Lord, when will
   You remove the curse? When will You bring the better days? These are
   ill times when the thorns grow thicker and more sharp than ever--
   protect Your lilies, increase their number, preserve their snowy
   whiteness and delight Yourself in them for Jesus' sake, Amen.

The Fair Portrait of a Saint

   (No. 1526)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MARCH 7, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "My foot has held fast to His steps, His way have I kept and not
   declined. Neither have I gone back from the commandment of His lips; I
   have esteemed the words of His mouth more than my necessary food." Job
   23:11,12.

   THUS Job speaks of himself, not by way of boasting, but by way of
   vindication. Eliphaz the Temanite and his two companions had brought
   distinct charges against Job's character. Because they saw him in such
   utter misery they concluded that his adversity must have been sent as a
   punishment for his sin and, therefore, they judged him to be a
   hypocrite who, under cover of religion, had exercised oppression and
   tyranny. Zophar had hinted that wickedness was sweet in Job's mouth and
   that he hid iniquity under his tongue. Eliphaz charged him with
   hardness of heart to the poor and dared to say, "You have taken a
   pledge from your brother for nothing and stripped the naked of their
   clothing." This last, from its very impossibility, was meant to show
   the extreme meanness to which he falsely imagined that Job must have
   descended--how could he strip the naked?. He was evidently firing at
   random.

   As neither he nor his companions could discover any palpable blot in
   Job upon which they could distinctly lay their finger, they bespattered
   him right and left with their groundless accusations. They made up, in
   venom, for the lack of evidence to back their charges. They felt sure
   that there must be some great sin in him to have procured such
   extraordinary afflictions and, therefore, by smiting him all over, they
   hoped to touch the sore place. Let them stand as a warning to us never
   to judge men by their circumstances and never to conclude that a man
   must be wicked because he has fallen from riches to poverty.

   Job, however, knew his innocence and he was determined not to give way
   to them. He said, "You are forgers of lies, physicians of no value. O
   that you would altogether hold your peace and it should be your
   wisdom!" He fought the battle right manfully. Not, perhaps, without a
   little display of temper and self-righteousness, but still, with much
   less of either than any of us would have shown had we been in the same
   plight and had we been equally conscious of perfect integrity. He has,
   in this part of his self-defense, sketched a fine picture of a man
   perfect and upright before God. He has set before us the image to which
   we should seek to be conformed. Here is the high ideal after which
   every Christian should strive and happy shall he be who shall attain to
   it.

   Blessed is he who, in the hour of his distress, if he is falsely
   accused, will be able to say with as much truth as the Patriarch could,
   "My foot has held His steps, His way have I kept and not declined.
   Neither have I gone back from the commandment of His lips; I have
   esteemed the words of His mouth more than my necessary food." I ask
   you, first, to inspect the picture of Job's holy life, that you may
   make it your model. After we have done this, we will look a little
   below the surface, asking the question, "How was he enabled to lead
   such an admirable life as this. Upon what meat did this great Patriarch
   feed that he had grown so eminent."

   We shall find the answer in our second head, Job's holy sustenance--"I
   have esteemed the words of His mouth more than my necessary food." May
   He, who worked in Job His patience and integrity, by this, our
   meditation, teach us the same virtues by the power of the Holy Spirit.

   Let us sit down before this sketch of JOB'S HOLY LIFE--it will well
   repay a meditative study. Note, first, that Job had been, all along, a
   man fearing God and walking after the Divine Rule. In the words before
   us he dwells much upon the things of God--"His steps." "His way." "The
   commandment of His lips." "The words of His mouth." He was
   pre-eminently one that "feared God and eschewed evil." He knew God to
   be the Lord and worthy to be served and, therefore, he lived in
   obedience to His Law which was written upon his instructed conscience.
   His way was God's way! He chose that course which the Lord commanded.
   He did not seek his own pleasure, nor the carrying out of his own will.

   Neither did He follow the fashion of the times, nor conform himself to
   the ruling opinion or custom of the age in which he lived--fashion and
   custom were nothing to him--he knew no rule but the will of the
   Almighty. Like some tall cliff which breasts the flood, he stood out
   almost alone, a witness for God in an idolatrous world. He acknowledged
   the living God and lived "as seeing Him who is invisible." God's will
   had taken the helm of the vessel and the ship was steered in God's
   course according to the Divine compass of Infallible Justice and the
   unerring chart of the Divine Will!

   This is a great point to begin with. It is, indeed, the only sure basis
   of a noble character. Ask the man who seeks to be the architect of a
   great and honorable character this question--Where do you place God? Is
   He second with you? Ah, then, in the judgment of Him whose view
   comprehends all human relationships, you will lead a very secondary
   kind of life, for the first and most urgent obligation of your being
   will be disregarded. But is God first with you? Is this your
   determination, "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord"? Do you
   seek, first, the kingdom of God and His righteousness?

   If so, you are laying the foundation for a whole or holy character, for
   you begin by acknowledging your highest responsibility. In this respect
   you will find that "the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom."
   Whether the way is rough or smooth, uphill or down dale, through green
   pastures or burning deserts, let God's way be your way! Where the fiery
   cloudy pillar of His Providence leads, be sure to follow and where His
   holy statutes command, there promptly go. Ask the Lord to let you hear
   His Spirit speak like a voice behind you, saying, "This is the way,
   walk you in it." As soon as you see from the Scriptures, or from
   conscience, or from Providence, what the will of the Lord is, make
   haste and delay not to keep His Commandments.

   Set the Lord always before you. Have respect unto His statutes at all
   times and in all your ways acknowledge Him. No man will be able to look
   back upon his life with complacency unless God has been sitting upon
   the throne of his heart and ruling all his thoughts, aims and actions.
   Unless he can say with David, "My soul has kept Your testimonies and I
   love them exceedingly," he will find much to weep over and little with
   which to answer his accusers. We must follow the Lord's way, or our end
   will be destruction! We must take hold upon Christ's steps, or our feet
   will soon be in slippery places! We must reverence God's Word, or our
   own words will be idle and full of vanity. And we must keep God's
   Commandments, or we shall be destitute of that holiness without which
   no man shall see the Lord.

   I set not forth obedience to the Law as the way of salvation, but I
   speak to those who profess to be saved already by faith in Christ Jesus
   and I remind all of you who are numbered with the company of Believers
   that if you are Christ's disciples you will bring forth the fruits of
   holiness--if you are God's children you will be like your Father!
   Godliness breeds God-likeness! The fear of God leads to imitation of
   God and where this is not so, the root of the matter is lacking. The
   Scriptural rule is, "by their fruits you shall know them," and by this
   we must examine ourselves.

   Let us now consider Job's first sentence. He says--"My foot has held
   fast to His steps." This expression sets forth great carefulness. He
   had watched every step of God, that is to say, he had been minute as to
   particulars, observing each precept which he looked upon as being a
   footprint which the Lord had made for him to set his foot in and,
   observing, also, each detail of the great example of His God. In so far
   as God is imitable He is the great example of His people, as He
   says--"Be you holy, for I am holy"--and again, "Be you perfect, even as
   your Father which is in Heaven is perfect." Job had observed the steps
   of God's Justice that he might be just.

   Job had observed the steps of God's mercy that he might be pitiful and
   compassionate. He had observed the steps of God's bounty that he might
   never be guilty of churlishness or lack of liberality. And he had
   studied the steps of God's Truth that he might never deceive. He had
   watched God's steps of forgiveness, that he might forgive his
   adversaries and God's steps of benevolence that he might, also, do good
   and communicate, according to his ability, to all that were in need. In
   consequence of this he became eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.
   He delivered the poor that cried and the fatherless and those that had
   none to help. The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon
   him and he caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. "My foot," he
   says, "has held fast to His steps." He means that he had labored to be
   exact in his obedience towards God and in his imitation of the Divine
   Character.

   Beloved, we shall do well if we are, to the minutest point, observant
   of the precepts and example of God in all things. We must follow not
   only the right road, but His footprints in that road. We are to be
   obedient to our heavenly Father not only in some things, but in all
   things--not in some places but in all places, abroad and at home, in
   business and in devotion--in the words of our lips and in the thoughts
   of our hearts. There is no holy walking without careful watching.

   Depend upon it, no man was ever good by chance, nor did anyone ever
   become like the Lord Jesus by a happy accident. "I put gold into the
   furnace," said Aaron, "and there came out this calf"--but nobody
   believed him. If the image was like a calf it was because he had shaped
   it with an engraving tool. If it is not to be believed that metal will,
   of itself, take the form of a calf, much less will character assume the
   likeness of God, Himself, as we see it in the Lord Jesus!

   The pattern is too rich and rare, too elaborate and perfect to ever be
   reproduced by a careless, half-awakened trifler! No, we must give all
   our heart and mind and soul and strength to this business and watch
   every step or else our walk will not be close with God, nor pleasing in
   His sight. O to be able to say, "My foot has held fast to His steps!"
   Notice here that the expression has something in it of tenacity. He
   speaks of taking hold upon God's steps. The idea needs to be lit up by
   the illustration contained in the original expression. You must go to
   mountainous regions to understand it.

   In very rough ways a person may walk all the better for having no shoes
   on his feet. I sometimes pitied the women of Mentone coming down the
   rough places of the mountains barefooted, carrying heavy loads upon
   their heads, but I ceased to pity them when I observed that most of
   them had a good pair of shoes in the basket at the top! And I
   perceived, as I watched them, that they could stand where I slipped
   because their feet took hold upon the rock, almost like another pair of
   hands. Barefooted they could safely stand and readily climb where feet
   encased after our fashion would never carry them!

   Many Orientals have a power of grasp in their feet which we appear to
   have lost from lack of use. An Arab in taking a determined stand,
   actually seems to grasp the ground with his toes! Roberts tells us in
   his well-known, "Illustrations," that Easterns, instead of stooping to
   pick up things from the ground with their fingers, will pick them up
   with their toes. And he tells of a criminal condemned to be beheaded,
   who, in order to stand firm when about to die, grasped a shrub with his
   foot. Job declares that he took fast hold of God's steps and thus
   secured a firm footing. He had a hearty grip of holiness, even as David
   said, "I have stuck unto Your testimonies." That eminent scholar, Dr.
   Good, renders the passage, "In His steps will I rivet my feet." He
   would set them as fast in the footprints of truth and righteousness as
   if they were riveted there, so firm was his grip upon that holy way
   which his heart had chosen.

   This is exactly what we need to do with regard to holiness--we must
   feel about for it with a sensitive conscience to know where it is and
   when we know it, we must seize upon it eagerly and hold to it as for
   our life. The way of holiness is often craggy and Satan tries to make
   it very slippery. Unless we can take hold of God's steps we shall soon
   slip with our feet and bring grievous injury upon ourselves and
   dishonor to His holy name. Beloved, to make up a holy character, there
   must be a tenacious adherence to integrity and piety. You must not be
   one that can be blown off his feet by the hope of a little gain, or by
   the threatening breath of an ungodly man--you must stand fast and stand
   firm and against all pressure and blandishment you must seize and grasp
   the precepts of the Lord and abide in them, riveted to them.

   Standfast is one of the best soldiers in the Prince Immanuel's army and
   one of the most fit to be trusted with the colors of His regiment.
   "Having done all, still stand." To make a holy character we must take
   hold of the steps of God in the sense of promptness and speed. Here
   again I must take you to the East to get the illustration. They say of
   a man who closely imitates his religious teacher, "His feet have laid
   hold of his master's steps," meaning that he so closely follows his
   teacher that he seems to take hold of his heels. This is a blessed
   thing, indeed, when Divine Grace enables us to follow our Lord closely.
   There are His feet and close behind them are ours. He takes another
   step and we plant our feet where He has planted His.

   A very beautiful motto is hung up in our infant classroom at the
   Stockwell Orphanage, "What would Jesus do?" Not only may children take
   it as their guide, but all of us may do the same, whatever our age.
   "What would Jesus do?" If you desire to know what you ought to do under
   any circumstances, imagine Jesus to be in that position and then think,
   "What would Jesus do? for what Jesus would do, that ought I to do." In
   following Jesus we are following God, for in Christ Jesus the
   brightness of the Father's Glory is best seen. Our example is our Lord
   and Master, Jesus the Son of God, and, therefore, this question is but
   a beam from our guiding Star. Ask in all cases--"What would Jesus do?"
   That unties the knot of all moral difficulty in the most practical way
   and does it so simply that no great wit or wisdom will be needed.

   May God's Holy Spirit help us to copy the line which Jesus has written,
   even as scholars imitate their writing master in each stroke and line
   and mark and dot. Oh, when we come to die and have to look back upon
   our lives, it will be a blessed thing to have followed the Lord fully!
   They are happy who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. Blessed are they
   in

   life and death of whom it can be said--as He was, so were they, also,
   in this world. Though misunderstood and misrepresented, yet they were
   honest imitators of their Lord! Such a true-hearted Christian can say,
   "He knows the way that I take. He tried me and I came forth as gold. My
   foot has held fast to His steps." You will avoid many a sorrow if you
   keep close at your Master's heels.

   You know what came of Peter's following afar off--try what will come of
   close walking with Jesus. Abide in Him and let His Words abide in you,
   so shall you be His disciples. You dare not trust in your works and
   will not think of doing so, but you will bless God that, being saved by
   His Grace, you were enabled to bring forth the fruits of the Spirit by
   a close and exact following of the steps of your Lord. Three things,
   then, we get in the first sentence--an exactness of obedience, a
   tenacity of grip upon that which is good and a promptness in
   endeavoring to keep in touch with God and to follow Him in all
   respects. May these things abound in us!

   We now pass on to the second sentence. I am afraid you will say, "Spare
   us, for even unto the first sentence we have not yet attained." Labor
   after it then, Beloved. Forgetting the things that are behind, except
   to weep over them, press forward to that which is before. May God give
   you those sensitive grasping feet which we have tried to describe--feet
   that take hold on the Lord's way--and may you throughout life keep that
   hold, for "blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the Law of
   the Lord."

   The next sentence runs thus--"His way have I kept"--that is to say, Job
   had adhered to God's way as the rule of his life. When he knew that
   such-and-such a thing was the mind of God, either by his conscience
   telling him that it was right, or by a Divine Revelation, then he
   obeyed the intimation and kept to it! He did not go out of God's way to
   indulge his own fancies, or to follow some supposed leader--to God's
   way he kept from his youth--even till the time when the Lord Himself
   said of him, to Satan, "Have you considered My servant Job, a perfect
   and an upright man, one that fears God and eschews evil?" The devil
   could not deny it and did not attempt to do so, but only muttered,
   "Does Job serve God for nothing? Have You not set a hedge about him and
   all that he has?"

   When Job uttered our text, he could have replied to the malicious
   accuser that even when God had broken down his hedges and laid him
   waste, he had not sinned nor charged God foolishly. He heeded not his
   wife's rash counsels to curse God and die--he still blessed the Divine
   Name even though everything was taken from him. What noble words are
   those--"Naked came I out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return
   there. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name
   of the Lord." Though bereft of all earthly comfort, he did not forsake
   the way of holiness, but still kept to his God! Keeping to the way
   signifies not simply adherence, but continuance and progress in it.

   Job had gone on in the ways of God year after year. He had not grown
   tired of holiness, nor weary of devotion, neither had he grown sick of
   what men call straight-laced piety. He had kept the way of God on and
   on and on, delighting in what Coverdale's version calls God's, "high
   street"--the highway of holiness. The further he went, the more
   pleasure he took in it and the more easy he found it to his feet, for
   God was with him and kept him--and so he kept God's way. "Your way have
   I kept." He means that, notwithstanding the difficulties in the way he
   persevered in it. It was stormy weather, but Job kept to the old road.
   The sleet beat in his face, but he kept His way--he had gone that path
   in fair weather and he was not going to forsake his God now that the
   storms were out--and so he kept His way.

   Then the scene changed, the sun was warm and all the air was redolent
   with perfume and merry with the song of birds, but Job kept His way. If
   God's Providence flooded Job's sky with sunshine, he did not forsake
   God because of prosperity, as some do, but kept His way--kept His way
   when it was rough, kept His way when it was smooth. When he met with
   adversities, he did not turn onto a side road, but traveled the King's
   highway, where a man is safest, for those who dare to assail him will
   have to answer for it to a higher power. The high street of holiness is
   safe because the King's guarantee is given that, "no lion shall be
   there, neither shall any ravenous beast go up on it." The righteous
   shall keep God's way and so Job did, come fair, come foul.

   When there were others in the road with him and when there were none,
   he kept His way. He would not even turn aside for those three good men,
   or men who thought themselves good, who sat by the wayside and
   miserably comforted, that is to say, tormented him! He kept God's way
   as one whose mind is made up and whose face is set like a flint. There
   was no turning him, he would fight his way if he could not have it
   peaceably. I like a man whose mind is set upon being right with God, a
   self-contained man, by God's Grace, who does not need patting on the
   back and encouraging and who,

   on the other hand, does not care if he is frowned at, but has counted
   the cost and abides by it. Give me a man who has a backbone--a brave
   fellow who has grit in him!

   It is well for a professor when God has put some soul into him and made
   a man of him, for if a Christian man is not a man as well as a
   Christian, he will not long remain a Christian man. Job was firm--a
   well-made character that did not shrink in the wetting. He believed his
   God! He knew God's way and he kept to it under all circumstances from
   his first start in life even until that day when he sat on a dunghill
   and transformed it into a throne where he reigned as among all mere
   men, the peerless prince of patience! You have heard of the patience of
   Job and of this, as one part of it, that he kept the way of the Lord.

   Now, dear Brothers and Sisters, on this second clause let me utter this
   word of self-examination. Have we kept God's way? Have we got into it
   and do we mean to keep it? Some are soon hot and soon cold. Some set
   out for the New Jerusalem like Pliable, very eagerly, but the first
   Slough of Despond they tumble into shakes their resolution and they
   crawl out on the homeward side and go back to the world. There will be
   no comfort in such temporary religion, but dreadful misery when we come
   to consider it on a dying bed! Changeful Pliables will find it hard to
   die! O to be constant even to the end, so as to say, "My foot has held
   fast to His steps, His way have I kept." God grant us Grace to do it by
   His Spirit abiding in us!

   The third clause is, "And not declined," by which I understand that he
   had not declined from the way of holiness, nor declined in the way of
   God. First, he had not declined from it. He had not turned to the right
   hand nor to the left. Some turn away from God's way to the right hand
   by doing more than God's Word has bid them do--such as invent religious
   ceremonies and vows and bonds and become superstitious--falling under
   the bondage of priestcraft and being led into will-worship and things
   that are not Scriptural. This is as truly wandering as going out of the
   road to the left would be!

   Ah, dear Friends, keep to the simplicity of the Bible! This is an age
   in which Holy Scripture is very little accounted of. If a Church
   chooses to invent a ceremony, men fall into it and practice it as if it
   were God's ordinance! Yes and if neither Church nor Law recognize the
   performance, yet if certain self-willed priests choose to burn candles
   and to wear all sorts of bedizenments and bow and cringe and march in
   procession, there are plenty of simpletons who will go whichever way
   their clergyman chooses, even if he should lead them into downright
   heathenism. "Follow my leader" is the game of the day, but, "Follow my
   God," is the motto of a true Christian!

   Job had not turned to the right. Nor had he turned to the left. He had
   not been lax in observing God's Commandments. He had shunned omission
   as well as commission. This is a very heart-searching matter, for how
   many there are whose greatest sins lie in omission. And remember, sins
   of omission--though they sit very light on many consciences and though
   the bulk of professors do not even think them sins--are the very sins
   for which men will be condemned at the last! How do I prove that? What
   said the great Judge? "I was hungry and you gave Me no meat. I was
   thirsty and you gave Me no drink; sick and in prison and you visited Me
   not." It was what they did not do that cursed them, more than what they
   did do. So look well to it and pray God that you may not decline from
   the way of His precepts, from Jesus who, Himself is the one and only
   Way.

   Furthermore, I take it Job means that he had not even declined in that
   way of God. He did not begin with running hard and then get out of
   breath and sit by the wayside and say, "Rest and be thankful." No, he
   kept up the pace and did not decline. If he was warm and zealous once,
   he remained warm and zealous. If he was indefatigable in service, he
   did not gradually tone down into a sluggard, but he could say, "I have
   not declined." Whereas we ought to make advances towards Heaven, there
   are many who are, after 20 years of profession, no more forward than
   they were, but perhaps in a worse state! Oh, beware of a decline!

   We were accustomed to use that term years ago to signify the
   commencement of a consumption, or perhaps the effects of it and,
   indeed, a decline in the soul often leads on to a deadly consumption.
   In a spiritual consumption the very life of religion seems to ebb out
   little by little. The man does not die by a wound that stabs his
   reputation, but by a secret weakness within him which eats at the
   vitals of godliness and leaves the outward surface fair. God save us
   from declining! I am sure, dear Friends, we cannot, many of us, afford
   to decline much, for we are none too earnest, none too much alive now!
   This is one of the great faults of Churches--so many of the members are
   in a decline that the Church becomes a hospital instead of a barracks.

   Many professors are not what they were at first--they were very
   promising young men, but they are not performing old men. We are
   pleased to see the flowers on our fruit trees, but they disappoint us
   unless they knit into fruit and we are not satisfied, even then, unless
   the fruit ripens to a mellow sweetness. We do not make orchards for the
   sake of blossoms--we want apples! And so it is with the garden of
   Grace. Our Lord comes seeking fruit and instead He often finds nothing
   but leaves. May God grant to us that we may not decline from the
   highest standard we have ever reached. "I would," said the Lord of the
   Church of Laodicea, "that you were either cold or hot."

   Oh, you lukewarm ones, take that warning to heart! Remember, Jesus
   cannot endure you--He will spit you out of His mouth--you make Him sick
   to think of you. If you were downright cold He would understand you. If
   you were hot He would delight in you. But being neither cold nor hot He
   is sick at the thought of you! He cannot endure you and, indeed, when
   we think of what the Lord has done for us, it is enough to make us sick
   to think that anyone should drag on in a cold, inanimate manner in His
   service, who loved us and gave Himself for us!

   Some decline because they become poor--they even stay from worship on
   that account. I hope none of you say, "I do not like to come to the
   Tabernacle because I have no fit clothes to come in." As I have often
   said, any clothes are fit for a man to come here if he has paid for
   them! Let each come by all manner of means in such garments as he has
   and he shall be welcome. But I know some very poor professors who, in
   the extremity of their anxiety and trouble, instead of flying to God,
   fly from Him. This is very sad. The poorer you are, the more you need
   the rich consolations of Divine Grace. Do not let this temptation
   overcome you, but if you are as poor as Job, be as resolved as he to
   keep to the Lord's way and not decline.

   Others fly from their religion because they grow rich. They say that
   three generations will never come on wheels to a dissenting place of
   worship and it has proven to be sadly true in many instances, though I
   have no cause to complain of you as yet. Some persons, when they rise
   in the world, turn up their noses at their poor friends. If any of you
   do so, you will be worthy of pity, if not of contempt! If you forsake
   the ways of God for the fashion of the world you will be poor gainers
   by your wealth! The Lord keep you from such a decline! Many decline
   because they conform to the fashion of the world and the way of the
   world is not the way of God! Does not James say, "Know you not that the
   friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whoever, therefore, will be
   a friend of the world is the enemy of God"?

   Others wander because they get into ill company, among witty people, or
   clever people, or hospitable people who are not gracious people. Such
   society is dangerous! People whom we esteem, but whom God does not
   esteem, are a great snare. It is very perilous to love those who love
   not God. He shall not be my bosom friend who is not God's friend, for I
   shall probably do him but little service and he will do me much harm.
   May the Grace of God prevent your growing cold from any of these causes
   and may you be able to say, "I have not declined." One more sentence
   remains--"Neither have I gone back from the commandment of His
   lips"--that is to say, as Job had not slackened his pace, so much less
   had he turned back. May none of you ever go back.

   This is the most cutting grief of a pastor, that certain persons come
   in among us and even come to the front, who, after a while, turn back
   and walk no more with us. We know, as John says, "They went out from
   us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no
   doubt have continued with us; but they went out, that they might be
   made manifest that they were not all of us." Yet what anguish it causes
   when we see apostates among us and know their doom! Take heed, Brothers
   and Sisters, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in
   departing from the living God! Let Lot's wife be a warning! Season your
   souls with a fragment of salt from that pillar and it may keep you from
   corruption.

   Remember that you can turn back, not only from all the Commandments and
   so become an utter apostate, but there is such a thing as backing at
   single Commandments. You know the precept to be right, but you cannot
   face it--you look at it and look at it and look at it and then go back,
   back, back from it, refusing to obey. Job had never done so. If it was
   God's command, he went forward to perform it. It may be that it seems
   impossible to go forward in the path of duty, but if you have faith,
   you are to go on whatever the difficulty may be. The slave was right
   who said, "Massa, if God say, 'Sam, jump through the wall,' it is Sam's
   business to jump and God's work to make me go through the wall." Leap
   at it, dear Friends, even if it seem to be a wall of granite! God will
   clear the road. By faith the Israelites went through the Red Sea as on
   dry land. It is ours to do what God bids us, as He bids us, when He
   bids us and no hurt can come of it. Strength equal to our day shall be
   given, only let us cry, "Forward!" and push on.

   Here just one other word. Let us take heed to ourselves that we do not
   go back, for going back is dangerous. We have no armor for our back, no
   promise of protection in retreat. Going back is ignoble and base. To
   have had a grand idea and then to turn back from it like a whipped cur,
   is disgraceful. Shame on the man who dares not be a Christian! Even
   sinners and ungodly men point at the man who put his hand to the plow
   and looked back and was not worthy of the kingdom. Indeed, it is fatal!
   For the Lord has said, "If any man draw back, My soul shall have no
   pleasure in him." Forward! Forward though death and Hell obstruct the
   way, for backward is defeat, destruction, despair! O God, grant us of
   Your Grace that when we come to the end of life we may say with joy, "I
   have not gone back from Your Commandments." The Covenant promises
   persevering Grace and it shall be yours--only be sure that you trifle
   not with this Grace.

   There is the picture which Job has sketched. Hang it up on the wall of
   your memory and God help you to paint after this old master, whose
   skill is unrivalled!

   II. Secondly, let us take a peep behind the wall to see how Job came by
   this character. Here we note Job's HOLY SUSTENANCE--"I have esteemed
   the words of His mouth more than my necessary food." First, then, God
   spoke to Job. Did God ever speak to you? I do not suppose Job had a
   single page of inspired writing. Probably he had not even seen the
   first books of Moses. He may have done so, but probably he had not. God
   spoke to him! Did He ever speak to you? No man will ever serve God
   aright unless God has spoken to him. You have the Bible and God speaks
   in that Book and through it--but mind you, do not rest in the printed
   letter without discerning its spirit. You must try to hear God's voice
   in the printed letter.

   "God has, in these last days, spoken unto us by His Son" but oh, pray
   that this Divine Son may speak by the Holy Spirit right into your
   heart! Anything which keeps you from personal contact with Jesus robs
   you of the best blessing! The Romanist says he uses a crucifix to help
   him to remember Christ and then his prayers often stop at the crucifix
   and do not get to Christ--and in the same manner you can make an idol
   of your Bible by using the mere words as a substitute for God's voice
   to you. The Book is to help you to remember God, but if you stick in
   the mere letter and get not to God at all, you misuse the sacred Word
   of God. When the Spirit of God speaks a text right into the soul. When
   God Himself takes the promise or the precept and sends it with living
   energy into the heart--this is that which makes a man have a reverence
   for the Word--he feels its awful majesty, its Divine supremacy and
   while he trembles at it he rejoices and goes forward to obey because
   God has spoken to him!

   Dear Friends, when God speaks, be sure that you have open ears to hear,
   for oftentimes He speaks and men regard Him not. In a vision of the
   night when deep sleep falls upon men, God has spoken to His Prophets,
   but now He speaks by His Word, applying it to the heart with power by
   His Spirit. If God speaks but little to us, it is because we are dull
   of hearing. Renewed hearts are never long without a whisper from the
   Lord. He is not a dumb God, nor is He so far away that we cannot hear
   Him! They that keep His ways and hold His steps, as Job did, shall hear
   many of His Words to their soul's delight and profit! God's having
   spoken to Job was the secret of his consistently holy life.

   Then note that what God had spoken to him, he treasured it up. He says
   in the Hebrew that he had hid God's Word more than ever he had hidden
   his necessary food. They had to hide grain away in those days to guard
   it from wandering Arabs. Job had been more careful to store up God's
   Word than to store up his wheat and his barley! He was more anxious to
   preserve the memory of what God had spoken than to garner his harvests!
   Do you treasure up what God has spoken? Do you study the Word? Do you
   read it? Oh, how little do we search it compared with what we ought to
   do! Do you meditate on it? Do you suck out its secret sweets? Do you
   store up its essence as bees gather the life-blood of flowers and hoard
   up their honey for winter food?

   Bible study is the metal that makes a Christian! It is the strong meat
   on which holy men are nourished! It is that which makes the bone and
   sinew of men who keep God's way in defiance of every adversary! God
   spoke to Job and Job treasured up His Words. We learn from our version
   of the text that Job lived on God's Word--he reckoned it to be better
   to him than his necessary food. He ate it. This is an art which some do
   not understand--eating the Word of the Lord. Some look at the surface
   of the Scriptures. Some pull the Scriptures to pieces without mercy.
   Some cut the heavenly bread into pieces and show their cleverness. Some
   pick it over for plums, like children with a cake. But blessed is he
   that makes it his meat and drink! He takes the Word of God to be what
   is, namely, a Word from the mouth of the Eternal and he says, "God is
   speaking to me in this and I will satisfy my soul upon it. I do not
   need anything better than this, anything

   truer than this, anything safer than this! And having got this, it
   shall abide in me, in my heart, in the very bowels of my life. It shall
   be interwoven with the warp and woof of my being."

   But the text adds that he esteemed it more than his necessary food. Not
   more than dainties only, for those are superfluities, but more than his
   necessary food and you know that a man's necessary food is a thing
   which he esteems very highly. He must have it. "What? Take away my
   bread?" he asks, as if this could not be borne. To take the bread out
   of a poor man's mouth is looked upon as the highest kind of
   villainy--but Job would sooner that they took the bread out of his
   mouth than the Word of God out of his heart! He thought more of it than
   of his necessary food and I suppose it was because meat would only
   sustain his body, but the Word of God feeds the soul. The nourishment
   given by bread is soon gone, but the nourishment given by the Word of
   God abides in us and makes us live forever! The natural life is more
   than meat, but our spiritual life feeds on meat even nobler than
   itself, for it feeds on the Bread of Heaven, the Person of the Lord
   Jesus!

   Bread is sweet to the hungry man, but we are not always hungry and
   sometimes we have no appetite. But the best of God's Word is that he
   who lives near to God has always an appetite for it and the more he
   eats of it the more he can eat! I confess I have often fed upon God's
   Word when I have had no appetite for it, until I have gained an
   appetite. I have grown hungry in proportion as I have felt
   satisfied--my emptiness seemed to kill my hunger--but as I have been
   revived by the Word I have longed for more! So it is written, "Blessed
   are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be
   filled"--and when they are filled they shall continue to enjoy the
   benediction, for they shall still hunger and thirst, though filled with
   Grace!

   God's Word is sweeter to the taste than bread to a hungry man and its
   sweetness never spoils, though it dwells long on the palate. You cannot
   be always eating bread, but you can always feed on the Word of God. You
   cannot eat all the meat that is set before you--your capacity is
   limited that way and none but a glutton wishes it otherwise. But oh,
   you may be ravenous of God's Word and devour it all and yet long for
   more! You are like a little mouse in a great cheese and you shall have
   permission to eat it all, though it is a thousand times greater than
   yourself! Though God's thoughts are greater than your thoughts and His
   ways are greater than your ways, yet may His ways be in your heart and
   your heart in His ways! You may be filled with all the fullness of God,
   though it seems a paradox. His fullness is greater than you and all His
   fullness is infinitely greater than you, yet you may be filled with all
   the fullness of God! So that the Word of God is better than our
   necessary food--it has qualities which our necessary food has not.

   No more, except this--you cannot be holy, my Brothers and Sisters,
   unless you, in secret, live upon the blessed Word of God--and you will
   not live on it unless it comes to you as the Word of His mouth. It is
   very sweet to get a letter from home when you are far away. It is like
   a bunch of fresh flowers in winter time. A letter from the dear one at
   home is as music heard over the water. But half a dozen words from that
   dear mouth are better than a dozen pages of manuscript, for there is a
   sweetness about the look and the tone which paper cannot carry! Now, I
   want you to get the Bible to be not a book, only, but a speaking
   trumpet through which God speaks from afar to you so that you may catch
   the very tones of His voice! You must read the Word of God to this end,
   for it is while reading, meditating and studying and seeking to dip
   yourself into its spirit that it seems, suddenly, to change from a
   written book into a talking book or phonograph!

   It whispers to you or thunders at you as though God had hidden Himself
   among its leaves and spoke to your condition! It speaks as though
   Jesus, who feeds among the lilies, had made the chapters to be lily
   beds and had come to feed there! Ask Jesus to cause His Word to come
   fresh from His own mouth to your soul and if it is so and you thus live
   in daily communion with a personal Christ, my Brothers and Sisters, you
   will then, with your feet take hold upon His steps! You will then keep
   His way! You will then never decline or go back from His Commandments,
   but you will make good speed in your pilgrim way to the Eternal City.

   May the Holy Spirit daily be with you! May each of you live under His
   sacred mist and be fruitful in every good word and work. Amen and amen.

Perfect Sanctification

   (No. 1527)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "By that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body
   of Jesus Christ once for all." Hebrews 10:10.

   DEAR Friends, ever since the Lord has quickened us by His Grace we have
   begun to look into ourselves and to search our hearts to see our
   condition before God. Hence many things which once caused us no
   disquietude now create in us great anxiety. We thought that we were all
   right and felt it to be enough to be quite as good as others. We
   dreamed that if we were not quite as good as we should be, we would
   certainly grow better, though we did not stop to inquire how or why. We
   took stock of our condition and concluded that we were rich and
   increased with goods and had need of nothing. A change has come over
   the spirit of the scene--the Grace of God has made us thoughtful and
   careful. We dare not take things for granted. We test and prove things,
   for we are very anxious not to be deceived. We look upon eternal
   realities as being of the utmost consequence and we dare not take them
   for granted as being certain to be right.

   We are afraid of being presumptuous and we long to be sincere. We hold
   an assize within our spirits and we are so afraid that we may be
   partial, as probably we shall be, that we ask the Lord to search us and
   try us, to see if there is any wicked way in us, that He may lead us
   out of such a way into the way everlasting. This is all very wise and
   very proper and I would not, for a moment, try to turn the people of
   God away from a proper measure of this state of heart. And yet let it
   never be forgotten that we are, in the sight of God, different, in some
   respects, than we shall ever see ourselves to be if we look through the
   glass of feeling and consciousness--there are other matters to be taken
   into consideration-- matters which our anxiety may lead us to overlook
   and our inward search may cause us to forget.

   Faith reveals to us another position for the people of God besides that
   which they occupy in themselves. Some call it an evangelical fiction
   and the like but, thank God, it is a blessed fact that sinners as we
   are in ourselves, yet Believers are saints in God's sight and that
   sinful as they feel themselves to be, yet they are washed, cleansed and
   sanctified in Jesus Christ! Notwithstanding all that we mourn over, the
   very fact that we do mourn over it becomes an evidence that we are no
   longer what we once were and do not stand, now, where we once stood. We
   have passed from death unto life! We have escaped from under the
   dominion of the Law into the kingdom of Divine Grace. We have come from
   under the curse and we dwell in the region of blessing!

   We have believed on Him that justifies the ungodly and our faith is
   counted for righteousness (Rom. 4:5). There is, therefore, no
   condemnation for us, for we are in Christ Jesus our Lord and walk no
   longer after the flesh but after the Spirit. That your hearts may be
   gladdened, I want yon to think of the noble position into which the
   Grace of God has lifted all Believers--the condition of sanctification
   which is spoken of in the text--for by the "will of God we are
   sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for
   all."

   We shall, first, speak of the eternal will. Secondly of the effectual
   Sacrifice by which that will has been carried out. And thirdly, of the
   everlasting result accomplished by that will through the Sacrifice of
   the body of Christ. May the Holy Spirit who has revealed the grand
   doctrine of Justification now enable us to understand it and to feel
   its comforting power.

   I. First, then, THE ETERNAL WILL--"By that will we have been
   sanctified." This will must, first of all, be viewed as the will
   ordained of old by the Father--the eternal decree of the Infinite
   Jehovah that a people whom He chose should be sanctified and set apart
   unto Himself. The will of Jehovah stands fast forever and ever and we
   know of it that it is altogether unchangeable and that it has no
   beginning. It is an eternal will, we have no vacillating Deity, no
   fickle God. He wills changes, but He never changes His will. "He is of
   one mind and who can turn Him? And what His soul desires, even that He
   does."

   The will of God is invincible as well as eternal. We are told in
   Ephesians that He works all things after the counsel of His own will.
   "Who can stay His hand, or say unto Him, What are You doing?" The good
   pleasure of His will is never defeated--there cannot be such a thing as
   a vanquished God. "His purpose shall stand and He will do all His
   pleasure." In fact, the will of God is the motive force of all things.
   "He spoke and it was done. He commanded and it stood fast." His Word is
   Omnipotent because His will is at the back of it and it puts force into
   it. He said, "Light be," and there was light because He willed that
   there should be light! He bade creatures come forth, numerous as the
   drops of dew, to people the world that He had made and forth they came,
   flying, leaping, swimming in varied orders of life, because of His own
   will He did create them.

   His will is the secret power which sustains the universe and threads
   the starry orbs and holds them like a necklace of light about the neck
   of Nature. His will is the Alpha and the Omega of all things. It was
   according to this eternal, invincible will of God that He chose,
   created and set apart a people that should show forth the glory and
   riches of His Grace--a people that would bear the image of His
   only-begotten Son, a people that should joyfully and willingly serve
   Him in His courts forever and ever--a people who should be His own sons
   and daughters, to whom He would say, "I will dwell in them and walk in
   them and they shall be My people and I will be their God."

   Thus stood the eternal will of old. "For whom He did foreknow, He also
   did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might
   be the firstborn among many brethren." But the people concerning whom
   this will was made were dead in sin, defiled with evil, polluted by
   transgression! The old serpent's venom was in their veins. They were
   fit to be set apart for the curse, but not to be set apart for the
   service of the thrice holy God! And the question was, how then, should
   the will of the Immutable Invincible ever be carried out? How shall
   these rebels become absolved? How shall these fountains of filth become
   clear as crystal, pouring forth floods of living water and Divine
   praise? How shall these unsanctified and defiled ones become sanctified
   unto the service of God?

   It must be--but how shall it be? Then came the priests, with smoking
   censers and with basins full of blood, steaming as it came fresh from
   the slaughtered victims and they sprinkled this blood upon the Book and
   upon the people, upon the altar and upon the Mercy Seat and upon all
   the hangings of the tabernacle and all the ground whereon the
   worshippers walked, for almost all things under the Law were sanctified
   by blood. Everywhere was this blood of bulls and of goats. Fresh every
   morning and renewed every evening. Still, God's will was not done, the
   chosen were not thus sanctified and we know they were not, because it
   is written, "Sacrifice and offering You did not desire." His will was
   not fulfilled in them. It was not His will that they should sanctify
   the people. They were inefficacious to such an end for, as the Holy
   Spirit has said, it was "not possible that the blood of bulls and of
   goats should take away sins." And so, if these offerings had been all
   there was, centuries of the house of Aaron and of the priests of the
   tribe of Levi might have come and gone and yet the will decreed by the
   eternal Father would not have been an accomplished fact!

   Thus we have landed at our second point, which is that this will by
   which we are sanctified was performed by the ever-blessed Son. It was
   the will of God the Father, but it was carried out by the Divine Son
   when He came into the world. A body was prepared for Him and into that
   body, in a mysterious manner which we will not attempt, even, to
   conceive of, He entered and there He was--the Incarnate God! This
   Incarnate God, by offering His own blood; by laying down His own life;
   by bearing in His own body the curse and in His own spirit enduring the
   wrath, was able to effect the purpose of the everlasting Father in the
   purging of His people, in the setting of His chosen apart and making
   them henceforth holiness unto the Lord.

   Do you not see what the will of the Father was--that He should have a
   people that should be sanctified unto Himself? But that will could not
   be carried out by the blood of bulls and of goats! It must be achieved
   by the offering up of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. Our Lord
   Jesus Christ has done whatever that will of the Father required for its
   perfect achievement. This is our satisfaction. We will not enter, at
   this time, into a detailed account of our Lord's active and passive
   obedience by which He magnified the Law and set apart His people. I
   pray you, however, never fall into the error of dividing the work of
   Christ as some do and say, "Here He made Atonement for sin and there He
   did not." In these modern times, certain brethren have invented
   refinements of statement of so trivial a character that they are not
   even worth the trouble of thinking over and yet, like babies with a new
   rattle, they make a noise with them all day long!

   It is amusing how these wise professors make grave points out of mere
   hair-splitting distinctions and if we do not agree with them they give
   themselves mighty airs, pitying our ignorance and esteeming themselves
   as superior persons

   who have an insight into things which ordinary Christians cannot see!
   God save us from having eyes which are so sharp that we are able to spy
   out new occasions for difference and fresh reasons for making men
   offenders for mere words. I believe in the life of Christ as well as in
   His death and I believe that He stood for me before God as much when He
   walked the acres of Palestine as when He hung on the Cross at
   Jerusalem. You cannot divide and split Him in sunder and say, "He is so
   far an example and so far an Atonement," but you must take the entire
   Christ and look at Him from the very first as the Lamb of God which
   takes away the sin of the world.

   "Oh, but," they say, "He made no Atonement except in His death," which
   is, let me tell you, an absurdity in language! Listen a minute. When
   does a man die? I cannot tell you. There is the minute in which the
   soul separates from the body, but all the time that a man may be
   described as dying he is alive, is he not? A man does not suffer when
   actually dead. What we call the pangs of death are truly and accurately
   pangs of life. Death does not suffer--it is the end of suffering! A man
   is in life while he suffers and if they say, "It is Christ's death that
   makes an Atonement and not His life," I reply that death, alone and by
   itself, makes no Atonement! Death in its natural sense and not in this
   modern non-natural severance from life, does make Atonement--but it
   cannot be viewed apart from life by any unsophisticated mind.

   If they must have distinctions, we could make distinctions enough to
   worry them of such an unprofitable business, but we have nobler work to
   do! To us our Lord's death seems to be the consummation of His life,
   the finishing stroke of a work which His Father had given Him to do
   among the sons of men. We view Him as having come in a body prepared
   for Him to do the will of God once--and that "once" lasted throughout
   His one life on earth! We will not, however, dwell on any moot point,
   but unfeignedly rejoice that whatever was needed to make God's people
   wholly sanctified unto God, Christ has worked out! "By that will we are
   sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once." It
   is finished!

   Does the Divine Law require, for our acceptance, perfect submission to
   the will of the Lord? Jesus has rendered it! Does it ask complete
   obedience to its precepts? He has presented the same! Does the
   fulfilled will of the Lord call for abject suffering, a sweat of blood,
   pangs unknown and death, itself? Christ has presented it all, whatever
   that "all" may be! As when God created, His Word effected all His will,
   so, when God redeemed, His blessed and Incarnate Word has done all His
   will! In every point, as God looked on each day's work and said, "It is
   good," so, as He looks upon each part of the work of His dear Son, He
   can say of it, "It is good." The Father joins in the verdict of His Son
   that it is finished--all the will of God for the sanctification of His
   people is accomplished!

   Beloved, this work must be applied to us by the Holy Spirit. It is the
   Holy Spirit who brings us to know that Jesus Christ has sanctified us,
   or set us apart and made us acceptable with God. It is the Holy Spirit
   who has given us the New Testament and shed a light upon the Old. It is
   the Holy Spirit who speaks to us through the ministers of Christ when
   He blesses them to our conversion. Especially is it the Holy Spirit who
   takes away from us all hope of being sanctified before God by any means
   of our own, brings us to see our need of cleansing and reconciliation
   and then takes of the things of Christ and reveals them to us.

   Not without the going forth of His sacred power are we made to take the
   place of separation and dedication, to which the Lord of old ordained
   us. Thus it is by the will of the Father, carried out by the Son and
   applied by the Holy Spirit that the Church of God is regarded as
   sanctified before God and is acceptable unto Him. I do not tarry longer
   on any one point because these great things are best spoken of with few
   words. They are subjects better fed upon by quiet thought than
   exhibited in speech.

   II. I invite you, dear Friends, in the second place, to consider THE
   EFFECTUAL SACRIFICE by which the will of God with regard to the
   sanctity of His people has been carried out. "By that will we are
   sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ." This
   implies, first, His Incarnation, which of course includes His eternal
   Deity. We can never forget that Jesus Christ is God. The Church has
   given forth many a valiant confession to His Deity and woe be to her
   should she ever hesitate on that glorious Truth of God! Yet sometimes
   she has great need to earnestly insist upon His Humanity. As you bow
   before your glorious Lord and adore Him with all the sanctified, yet
   remember that He whom you worship was truly and really a Man.

   The Gospel of His Incarnation is not a spiritual idea, nor a metaphor,
   nor a myth. In very deed and truth the God that made Heaven and earth
   came down to earth and hung upon a woman's breast as an Infant. That
   Child, as He grew in stature and wisdom, was as certainly God as He is
   at this moment in Glory! He was as surely God when He was here hun-

   gry and suffering, sleeping, eating, drinking as He was God when He
   hung up the morning stars and kindled the lamps of night, or as He
   shall be when sun and moon shall dim at the brightness of His coming!
   Jesus Christ, very God of very God, did certainly stoop to become such
   as we are and was made in the likeness of sinful flesh. It is a Truth
   of God you all know, but I want you to grasp it and realize it. It will
   help you to trust Christ if you clearly perceive that, Divine as He is,
   He is bone of your bone and flesh of your flesh--your Kinsman, though
   the Son of God. All this is implied in the text, because it speaks of
   the offering of the body of Christ.

   But why does it specially speak of the body? I think to show us the
   reality of that offering--His soul suffered and His soul's sufferings
   were the soul of His sufferings, but still, to make it palpable to us,
   to record it as a sure historical fact, the Holy Spirit mentions that
   there was an offering of the body of Christ. I take it, however, that
   the word means the whole of Christ--that there was an offering made of
   all of Christ, the body of Him, or that of which He was constituted. It
   is my solemn conviction that the Deity co-worked with His Humanity in
   the wondrous passion by which He has sanctified His elect.

   I am told that Deity cannot suffer. I am expected to subscribe to that
   because theologians say so. Well, if it is true, then I shall content
   myself with believing that the Deity helped the Humanity by
   strengthening it to suffer more than it could otherwise have endured.
   But I believe that Deity can suffer, heterodox as that notion may seem
   to be. I cannot believe in an impassive God as my Father. If He pities
   and sympathizes, surely He must have some sensibilities! Is He a God of
   iron? If He wills it, He can do anything and, therefore, He can suffer
   if He pleases. It is not possible for God to be made to suffer--that
   would be a ridiculous supposition--yet if He wills to do so, He is
   certainly capable of doing that as well as anything else--for all
   things are possible to Him.

   I look upon our Lord Jesus as in His very Godhead stooping down to bear
   the weight of human sin and human misery, sustaining it because He was
   Divine and able to bear what otherwise had been too great a load. Thus
   the whole of Christ was made a Sacrifice for sin. It was the offering,
   not of the spirit of Christ, but of the very body of Christ--the
   essence, subsistence and most manifest reality and personality of Jesus
   Christ, the Son of the Most High! And this was wholly offered. I do not
   know how to bring out my own thoughts here, but to accomplish the will
   of God in sanctifying all His people, Christ must be the Offering and
   He must be wholly offered.

   There were certain sacrifices which were only presented to God in part,
   so far as the consumption by fire was concerned. A part was eaten by
   the priest or by the offerer and so far it was not a whole burnt
   offering. In this there was much precious Truth set forth, of which we
   will not speak at this time, but as our Sin-Offering, making expiation
   for guilt, our blessed Lord and Master gave Himself wholly for us as an
   atoning Sacrifice and Offering for sin--and that, "Himself," sums up
   all you can conceive it to be in and of the Christ of God! And the
   pangs and griefs which, like a fire went through Him, did consume Him,
   even to the uttermost of all that was in Him.

   He bore all that could be borne! He stooped to the lowest to which
   humility could stoop! He descended to the utmost abyss to which a
   descent of self-denial could be made! He made Himself of no reputation!
   He emptied Himself of all honor and glory! He gave up Himself without
   reserve! He saved others, Himself He could not save--He spares us in
   our chastisements, but Himself He spared not! He says of Himself in the
   22nd Psalm, "I am a worm and no man; a reproach of men and despised of
   the people." You do not know, you cannot imagine how fully the
   Sacrifice was made by Christ! It was not only a Sacrifice of all of
   Himself, but a complete Sacrifice of every part of Himself for us! The
   blaze of eternal wrath for human sin was focused upon His head!

   The anguish that must have been endured by Him who stood in the place
   of millions of sinners to be judged of God and smitten in their place
   is altogether inconceivable! Though Himself perfectly innocent, yet in
   His own Person to offer up such a Sacrifice as could honor the Divine
   Justice on account of myriads of sins of myriads of the sons of men was
   a work far beyond all human realization! You may give loose to your
   reason and your imagination and rise into the seventh Heaven of sublime
   conception as with eagle wings, but you can never reach the utmost
   height. Here is the sum of the matter--"Thanks be unto God for His
   unspeakable gift," for unspeakable, inconceivable it certainly is when
   we view the Lord Jesus as a Sacrifice for the sins of men!

   This offering was made once and only once. The pith of the text lies in
   the finishing words of it, "through the offering of the body of Jesus
   Christ once for all." Those words, "for all," are very properly put in
   by the translators but you must not make a mistake as to their meaning.
   The text does not mean that Christ offered Himself up once for
   all--that is,

   for all mankind. That may be a doctrine of Scripture, or it may not be
   a doctrine of Scripture--but it is not the teaching here. The passage
   means "once for all" in the sense of--all at once, or only once. As a
   man might say, "I gave up my whole estate once and for all to my
   creditors and there was the end of the matter," so here our Lord Jesus
   Christ is said to have offered Himself up as a Sacrifice once and for
   all--that is to say, only once and that was the end of the matter.

   His Sacrifice on behalf of His people was for all the sins before He
   came. Think of what they all were! Ages had succeeded ages and there
   had been found among the various generations of men criminals of the
   blackest dye and crimes had been multiplied. The Prophet said in vision
   concerning Christ, as he looked on all the multitude, "All we like
   sheep have gone astray: we have turned every one to his own way; and
   the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all." That was before He
   came. Reflect that there has been no second offering of Himself ever
   since and never will be--it was once and that once did the deed!

   Now let your mind conceive of this--nearly 2,000 years have passed
   since the offering and if the Prophet were to stand here tonight and
   look back through those 1,800 years and more, he would still say, "All
   we like sheep have gone astray: we have turned every one to his own
   way; and the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all." Oh, it is a
   wonderful conception--the Sacrifice of the Lord Jesus was the reservoir
   into which all the sins of the human race ran, from this quarter and
   that and that and that and that! All the sins of His people rolled in a
   torrent unto Him and gathered as in a great lake! In Him was no sin and
   yet the Lord made Him to be sin for us. You may have seen a deep
   mountain lake which has been filled to the brim by innumerable
   streamlets from all the hillsides round about. Here comes a torrent
   gushing down and there trickles from the moss that has overgrown the
   rock a little drip, drip, drip, which falls perpetually-- great and
   small tributaries all meet in the black lake which, after the rain, is
   full to the brim and ready to burst its banks!

   That lone lake pictures Christ, the meeting place of the sins of His
   people! They were all laid on Him, that from Him the penalty might be
   exacted. At His hands the price must be demanded for the ransom of all
   this multitude of sins! And it is said that He did this once for all. I
   have no language with which to describe it--but I see before me the
   great load of sin, the huge, tremendous world of sin! No, no, it is
   greater than the world! Atlas might carry that, but this is a weight
   compared with which the world is but as a pin's head! Mountains upon
   mountains, alps on alps are nothing to the mighty mass of sin which I
   see before my mind's eyes! And lo, it all falls upon the Well-Beloved!
   He stands beneath it and bows under it till the bloody sweat starts
   from every pore and yet He does not yield to its weight so as to get
   away from the burden! It presses more heavily, it bows Him to the dust,
   it touches His very soul, it makes Him cry in anguish, "My God, My God,
   why have You forsaken Me?" and yet, at the last He lifts Himself up and
   flings it all away and cries, "It is finished!" And it is gone!

   There is not a speck of it left! No, not an atom of it left! It is all
   gone at once and once and for all. He has borne the immeasurable weight
   and cast it off from His shoulders forever and, as it lies no more on
   Him, so also it lies no more on us! Sin shall never be mentioned
   against His people any more forever. Oh, wondrous deed of Deity! Oh,
   mighty feat of love accomplished once and for all! The Redeemer never
   offered Himself to death before. He never will do it again! Look at it
   this way, my Brothers and Sisters--the reason why it never will be done
   again is because there is no need for it! All the sin that was laid
   upon Jesus is gone--all the sin of His people is forever discharged. He
   has borne it--the debt is paid! The handwriting of ordinances against
   us is nailed to His Cross! The accuser's charge is answered forever.

   What, then, shall we say of those who come forward and pretend that
   they perpetually present the body of Christ in the unbloody sacrifice
   of the "mass?" Why, no profane jest from the lips of Voltaire ever had
   even the slightest degree of God-defiant blasphemy in it compared with
   such a hideous insult as this horrible pretense! It is infernal! I will
   say no less. There can be nothing more intolerable than that notion,
   for our Lord Jesus Christ has offered Himself for sin once and once and
   for all! He who dares to think of offering Him again insults Him by
   acting as if that once were not enough. I cannot believe any language
   of abhorrence to be too strong if the performers and attendants at the
   "mass" really knew what is implied in their professed act and deed!

   In the judgment of Christian charity we may earnestly pray, "Father,
   forgive them, for they know not what they do." Our words fail and our
   conceptions faint at the thought of the great Substitute with all the
   sins of His people condensed into one black draught and set before Him!
   How shall we think of Him as putting that cup to His lips and drinking,
   drinking, drinking all the wrath till He had drained the cup to the
   bottom and filled Himself with horror? Yet look, He has finished the
   death-drink and turned the cup upside down, crying, "It is finished!"
   At one tremendous draught the

   loving Lord has drained destruction dry for all His people and there is
   no dreg nor drop left for any one of them, for now is the will of God
   accomplished--"by that will we are sanctified through the offering of
   the body of Jesus Christ once for all." Glory be to God! And yet again,
   glory be to God!--

   "He bore on the tree the sentence for me,

   And now both the Surety and sinner are free.

   In the hea venly Lamb thrice happy I am

   And my heart does rejoice at the sound of His name." III. Now I close
   with our third head and that is THE EVERLASTING RESULT. The everlasting
   result of this effectual carrying out of the will of God is that God
   now regards His people's sin as expiated and their persons as
   sanctified. Our sin is removed by expiation. Atonement has been offered
   and its efficacy abides forever. There is no need of any other
   expiation. Believers repent bitterly, but not in the way of expiation.
   There is no penance to be exacted of them by way of putting away guilt.
   Their guilt is gone--their transgression is forgiven! The Covenant is
   made with them and it runs thus--"Their sins and their iniquities will
   I remember no more forever." Their sins have, in fact, been ended,
   blotted out and annihilated by the Redeemer's one Sacrifice.

   Next, they are reconciled. There is no quarrel, now, between God and
   those who are in Christ Jesus. Peace is made between them forever. The
   middle wall that stood between them is taken away. Christ, by His one
   Sacrifice, has made peace for all His people and effectually
   established an amity which never shall be broken--

   "Lord Jesus, we believing

   In You have peace with God,

   Eternal life receiving

   The purchase of Your blood.

   Our curse and condemnation

   You bore in our stead

   Secure is our salvation

   In You, our risen Head."

   Moreover, they are not only accepted and reconciled, but they are
   purified--the taint that was upon them is taken away. In God's sight
   they are regarded no more as unclean. They are no longer shut outside
   the camp--they may come to the Throne of the heavenly Grace whenever
   they will. God can have communion with them! He regards them as fit to
   stand in His courts and to be His servants, for they are purified,
   reconciled, expiated through the one Offering of Christ! Their
   admission into the closest intimacy with God could never be allowed if
   He did not regard them as purged from all un-cleanness and this has
   been effected not at all by themselves, but only by the great
   Sacrifice--

   "Your blood, not mine, O Christ, Your blood so freely spilt, Has
   blanched my blackest stains, And purged away my guilt. Your
   righteousness, O Christ, Alone does cover me. No righteousness avails
   Save that which is in Thee."

   Now, what has come of it? That is the point. I want you, now, to let me
   leave the doctrine and try and bring out the experience arising from
   it. What Christ has done in the carrying out of the great will of God
   has effected salvation for all His chosen--but this is applied to them
   actually and experimentally by the Holy Spirit's dwelling in them--by
   which indwelling they know they are now God's people. The Israelites
   were God's people, after a fashion. The Levites were more peculiarly so
   and the priests were still more especially so--and all of these had to
   present perpetual sacrifices and offerings that God might be able to
   look upon them as His people--for they were a sinful people.

   You and I are not typically, but truly and really His people. Through
   Jesus Christ's offering of Himself once and for all, we are really set
   apart to be the Lord's people from now on and forever and He says of
   us--I mean, of course, not of us all, but of as many as have believed
   in Jesus and to whom the Holy Spirit has revealed His finished work--"I
   will be their God and they shall be My people." You Believers are
   sanctified in this sense, that you are now the set-apart ones unto God
   and you belong wholly to Him. Will you think that over? "I am now not
   my own. I do not belong, now, to the

   common order of men, as all the rest of men do. I am set apart. I am
   called out. I am taken aside. I am one of the Lord's own. I am His
   treasure and His portion. He has, through Jesus Christ's death, made me
   one of those of whom He says-- 'They shall dwell alone, they shall not
   be numbered among the people.'"

   I want you to feel it so that you may live under the power of that fact
   that you may feel, "My Lord has cleansed me. My Lord has made expiation
   for me. My Lord has reconciled me unto God and I am God's man, I am
   God's woman. I cannot live as others do. I cannot be one among you. I
   must come out. I must be separate. I cannot find my pleasure where you
   find yours. I cannot find my treasure where you find yours. I am God's
   and God is mine. That wondrous transaction on the Cross of which our
   minister has tried to speak, but of which he could not speak as he
   ought--that wondrous unspeakable deed upon the Cross--that wonderful
   life and death of Jesus, has made me one of God's people, set apart
   unto Him and as such I must live."

   When you realize that you are God's people, the next thing is to
   reflect that God, in sanctifying a people, set them apart for His
   service and He made them fit for His service. You, Beloved, through
   Christ's one great Offering of His body for you, are permitted, now, to
   be the servants of God! You know it is an awful thing for a man to try
   and serve God until God gives Him permission--there is a presumption
   about it. Suppose that one of the Queen's enemies, who has sought her
   life and has always spoken against her, were to say, "I mean to be one
   of her servants. I will go into her palace and I will serve her,"
   having all the while in his heart a rebellious, proud spirit? His
   service could not be tolerated! It would be sheer impudence. Even so,
   "Unto the wicked God says, What have you to do to declare My statutes?"
   A wicked man, pretending to serve God, stands in the position of Korah,
   Dathan and Abiram trying to offer incense because he is not purified
   and not called to the work and has no fitness for it.

   But now, Beloved, you that are in Christ are called to be His servants.
   You have permission and leave to serve Him. It ought to be your great
   joy to be accepted servants of the living God. If you are only the
   Lord's shoeblack, you have a greater privilege than if you were an
   emperor! If the highest thing you ever will be allowed to do should be
   to loosen the laces of your master's shoes or to wash his servants'
   feet--if that master is Christ you are favored above the mightiest of
   the mighty! Men of renown may envy you--their orders of the Garter or
   the Golden Fleece are nothing compared with the high dignity of being
   servitors of King Jesus! Look upon this as being the result of Christ's
   death upon the Cross, that such a poor, sinful creature as you
   are--once a slave of the devil--is now allowed to be the servant of
   God!

   On the Cross my Master bought for me the privilege to preach to you at
   this time. And He bought for you, dear Mother, the privilege to go home
   and train your little child for the great Father in Heaven. In fact, He
   bought for us a sanctification which has made us the Lord's people and
   has enabled us to engage in His service. Do we not rejoice in this?
   Next to that we have this privilege that what we do can now be
   accepted. Because Jesus Christ, by the offering of His body once, has
   perfected the Father's will and has sanctified us, therefore what we do
   is now accepted with God! We might have done whatever we would, but God
   would not have accepted it from a sinner's hands--from the hands of
   those that were out of Christ.

   Now He accepts anything of us. You dropped a penny into the box--it was
   all that you could give and the Lord accepted it! It dropped into His
   hand! You offered a little prayer in the middle of business this
   afternoon because you heard an ill word spoken--and your God accepted
   that prayer. You went down the street and spoke to a poor sick person.
   You did not say much, but you said all you could--the great God
   accepted it! Acceptance in the Beloved, not only for our persons, but
   for our prayers and our works, is one of the sweetest things I know of.
   We are accepted! That is the joy of it. Through that one great bloody
   Sacrifice, once and for all offered, God's people are forever accepted
   and what His people do for Him is accepted, too! And now we are
   privileged to the highest degree, being sanctified--that is to say,
   made into God's people, God's servants and God's accepted servants!

   Every privilege which we could have had, if we had never sinned, is now
   ours and we are in Him as His children. We have more than would have
   come to us by the Covenant of Works and if we will but know it and live
   up to it, even the very privilege of suffering and the privilege of
   being tried--the privilege of being in need--should be looked upon as a
   great gift, for I think an angel spirit, seated high alone there,
   meditating and adoring, might say within himself, "I have served God.
   These swift wings have borne me through the ether on His errands, but I
   never suffered for Him. I was never despised for Him. Drunks never
   called me names. I was never misrepresented as God's servant. After
   all, though I have served Him, it has been one perpetual joy. He has
   set a hedge about me and all that I have."

   If an angel could envy anybody, I think he would envy the martyr who
   had the privilege of burning to the death for Christ, or such as Job,
   who, when stripped of everything and covered with sores, could sit on a
   dunghill and yet honor his God! Such as these achieved an unique
   service within itself which has sparkling diamonds of the first water
   glittering about it--but the same cannot be found in an unsuffering
   ministry--be it as complete as it may! You are favored sons of Adam,
   you who have become sons of God! You are favored beyond cherubim and
   seraphim in accomplishing a service for the manifestation of the riches
   of the Grace of God which unfallen spirits never could accomplish!
   Rejoice and be exceedingly glad that this one offering has put you
   there.

   And now you are eternally secure. No sin can ever be laid to your door,
   for it is all put away and sin being removed, every other evil has lost
   its fang and sting. Now you are eternally beloved, for you are one with
   Him who can never be other than dear to the heart of Jehovah! That
   union never can be broken, for nothing can separate us from the love of
   God and, therefore, your security can never be imperiled. Now are you
   in some measure glorified for, "the spirit of glory and of Christ does
   rest upon you," and our conversation is in Heaven, from where we look
   for the Savior, the Lord Jesus, who has already raised us up together
   and made us sit together in the heavenlies! Heaven is already ours in
   promise, in price and in principle and the preparation for it has also
   begun. I feel at this hour that--

   "All that remains for me Is but to love and sing, And wait until the
   angels come To bear me to their King."

   In such a spirit would I always live!

   Brothers and Sisters, are you dispirited at this time? Have you a great
   trouble upon you? Are you alone in the world? Do others misjudge you,
   or does the iron of scandal pierce your very soul? Do fierce coals of
   juniper await those vicious tongues that wrong you? Do you feel bowed
   into the dust? Yet, why are you despairing? Child of God and heir of
   all things, why are you cast down? Joint heir with Christ, why are
   groveling? Why do you lie among the pots when you have already angels'
   wings about you? Up, Man, up! Your heritage is not here among the
   dragons and the owls. Up! You are one of God's eagles, born for
   brighter light than earth could bear--light that would blind the
   weak-eyed sons of men if they were once to get a veiled glimpse of it!
   You, a twice-born man, one of the imperial family, one that shall sit
   upon a throne with Christ as surely as Christ sits there--why are you
   moaning and groaning?

   Wipe your eyes and smooth your brow and in the strength of the Eternal
   go to your life-battle. It will not be long. The trumpet of victory
   almost sounds in your ears. Will you now beat a retreat? No! Play the
   man and win the day! "Trust in the Lord and do good; so shall you dwell
   in the land and verily you shall be fed," till He comes to catch you
   away where you shall see what Jesus did for you when He made His body
   once and for all a Sacrifice that He might fulfill the will of the
   eternal Father and sanctify you and all His people unto God forever and
   ever! May the best of blessings rest upon all who are in Christ Jesus.
   Amen.

   STOCKWELL ORPHANAGE FOR GIRLS

   The land being bought and paid for, Mr. Spurgeon is anxious to begin
   building, since large numbers of orphans are applying. The block, which
   will contain houses for 250 girls and the various schoolrooms, will
   cost about £8,000, of which £3,000 is promised. To raise the rest of
   the money will need the united liberality of many and the special
   bounty of the few who are wealthy. It is proposed that the first stone
   should be laid on Mr. Spurgeon's birthday, June 19, should a sufficient
   sum be in hand to make it prudent to begin. Sympathizing readers can
   forward donations to Mr. Spurgeon, Nightingale Lane, Balham, and he
   will gratefully acknowledge the same.

"They Were Tempted"

   (No. 1528)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MARCH 14, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "They were tempted." Hebrews 11:37.

   LAST Lord's-Day I tried to draw the fair portrait of a believing man
   [Sermon #1526, The Fair Portrait of a Saint] putting his feet into
   God's steps and keeping God's way even unto the end. This morning we
   shall show in what circumstances such men were produced. We shall
   discover that they were not nursed upon the lap of ease, but were born
   and reared and perfected amid storms of opposition. We shall again see
   "the lily among thorns." The gracious characters of which we read in
   Scripture were not created by favorable circumstances--they owed
   nothing to their position or age-- their character was formed from
   within. Their faith was not produced by the tenderness of
   Providence--they were not put into a conservatory like fair flowers
   which cannot endure the frost--we might rather say that they were
   helped to their robustness by the rough winter blasts which swept over
   them.

   They were warriors of peace--pilgrims who traveled armed to the teeth
   making no holiday march, but contending with giants and dragons.
   Whoever else may find life a sport, the saints have found it to be real
   and earnest. Their path has been no mere parade, but grim and grisly
   dangers have beset them--"they were stoned, they were sawn asunder,
   they were slain with the sword." One form of the opposition which they
   encountered is the subject of this morning's meditation--"They were
   tempted." Do not forget that the leading principle of a godly man is
   faith and, according to this chapter, faith is the force by which brave
   deeds are done and great sufferings are endured.

   All the world appears to be in arms against the man of faith. Ishmael,
   the child of human strength, mocks Isaac who is born by the power of
   faith according to promise. Yet faith is able to bear all attacks and
   to flourish under them, even as the Israelites in Egypt multiplied the
   more as their oppressions were increased. The sufferings of Believers,
   which are mentioned by Paul, are varied and exceedingly intense. And
   this is one of them--"they were tempted." The speedy weapon of stone,
   or sword, or saw gratified the malice which sought their death, but
   tempting them satisfied a subtle hate which stabbed at their character
   and their faith.

   In temptation there is for the soul all the deadliness which the
   slaughter weapon brings to the body. It is blessed to observe that the
   faithful also survived this danger. A torrent roared against them and
   they stemmed it with resolute confidence. They did not drift with the
   current, nor drown in its floods. Dealing with this one form of
   opposition, "they were tempted," I shall be able to say a great many
   more practical things than if I were preaching upon, "they were
   stoned," or, "they were sawn asunder," for those things happen but now
   and then. But this record that, "they were tempted," is repeated in us
   all and, especially in you who have lately set out on the heavenly
   pilgrimage. You have got far enough to discover that you are not to be
   allowed to go to Heaven if Satan can prevent it, nor suffered to remain
   a Christian if by any means the men of this world can cast you down.

   You are being tempted. May the practical words I shall be able to speak
   be applied with power by the Holy Spirit to your comfort and help.

   I. First I will call attention to THE UNIVERSAL TRUTH OF THE STATEMENT
   now before us. It is not true that all the saints were scourged, nor
   all imprisoned. Neither were all stoned, nor all slain with the sword.
   But it is true of the whole cloud of witnesses that they were all
   tempted. The word, "tempted," bears two meanings. First of all, that of
   being tried or afflicted and, secondly, that of being persuaded or
   enticed to sin. In the first aspect of it God did tempt Abraham, that
   is, He tried him and this He does with all His people. God had one Son
   without sin, but He never had a son without trial!

   "What son is there whom the Father chastened not?" "Of which you are
   all partakers," says Paul, when he speaks of chastening. "For whom the
   Lord loves, He corrects, even as a father the son in whom he delights."
   His own elect are

   made to feel His refining fires, for He declares of each one "I have
   chosen you in the furnace of affliction." All the sheep of Christ bear
   His private mark--He sets the cross of affliction upon them all. "All
   that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." "In the
   world you shall have tribulation." Before you shall find me a man who
   has never known trouble I think you will have ridden many a horse lame
   and searched far and wide for, "man is born to trouble as the sparks
   fly upward." And I will guarantee that the wonderful untried person is
   as much a stranger to God as he is to affliction!

   Within the sacred enclosure of the elect of God you shall not be able
   to discover one whom the Lord has not, in some way or at some time
   afflicted in love. Count it not, therefore, a strange thing, my dear
   Brothers and Sisters, that you should have a cross to carry! Do not
   begin to kick against the pricks as though some unusual suffering were
   laid upon you when the Lord touches you with the goad of sorrow. You
   are one among many and among the many there are worthy ones who bear
   heavier loads than yours! Envy none, but feel a brotherhood with all
   the faithful, for they, too, "were tempted." As for the other sense of
   the word, "tempt"--the bad and hard one. In that sense, also, the
   statement is universally true. All the people of God have been tempted
   to sin. Satan no sooner perceives a child of God renewed in heart and
   cleansed from defilement than he endeavors, if he can, to mar the work
   of the Holy Spirit; to ruin the happiness of the Believer and to weaken
   his usefulness by leading him into sin.

   The Prince of the power of the air, though he cannot be everywhere
   himself, manages with his host of underlings to be so nearly
   omnipresent that he tempts us all in turns and some of us very
   fiercely. Woe unto the man who is beset by the arch enemy, himself, if
   he is not abiding in fellowship with the Lord Jesus! If the Lord is
   away from the Believer it will go hard with him when Apollyon, himself,
   meets him in deadly duel. The fiend is stronger and craftier than we
   are and unless the Lord covers our head in the day of battle we shall
   find his fiery darts too terrible. This, however, is some comfort, that
   every Believer now with God has crossed swords with the devil--He has
   not suffered one to pass unmolested-- "they were tempted."

   Nor is it only Satan who tempts the saints. The world is always
   tempting God's people and there is no position in life which is free
   from peril. A man sick of the fever dreams that if he can be placed in
   another bed he shall feel better--it is but a dream. He turns and
   tosses to and fro upon his pillow, but as Watts well says--

   "It is a poor relief we gain To shift the place but keep the pain." In
   this mortal life we may change our position, but we shall never get
   away from temptation. Temptations are with kings upon their thrones and
   with peasants at the plow--they come of plenty and they come of
   poverty--they are born of success and they are born of defeat. Whether
   our path is rough or smooth, we are liable to be tripped up unless an
   unseen hand shall hold us up. This is true of all who have gone before
   us--"they were tempted."

   At times Providence permits those who are in authority to exercise
   great power of temptation. So it was with the saints of old--those who
   were in power accounted them as sheep for the slaughter. The rulers of
   the synagogues and then the magistrates, rulers and emperors set
   themselves against God and against His Christ and those who held the
   reins of government were determined that they would put down the reign
   of Christ and utterly destroy His people. Princes and potentates became
   the willing servitors of Satan, threatening and bribing those who had
   espoused the faith. So far as open, legalized persecution by the State
   is concerned, we are happily free from it--but of those who in the
   martyr days bore high the banner of the Cross it may be said with
   emphasis--"they were tempted."

   But, Brothers and Sisters, if there were no devil and if there were no
   wicked world it would still be true that the saints are tempted, for
   every man is tempted when he is "drawn away by his own lusts" and there
   is that within the best of men which might make them into the worst of
   men if the Grace of God did not prevent it! O child of God, you are, on
   one side, fair as an angel and the Grace of God gleams upon you and
   makes you bright as your transfigured Master! And yet on the other side
   of you, you are black as a devil and if the Grace of God were taken
   from you, you would as much dishonor the name and Cross of Christ as
   did the false apostate who took the thirty pieces of silver! Every good
   man is two men--he finds one fighting against the other--the old man,
   according to its corruptions and lusts, daily warring with the new-born
   man within him which cannot sin because it is born of God.

   Now it is true, not only of you and me, but it has been true of all the
   people of God, that they have had inward conflicts and spiritual
   contests within themselves of the most painful kind. The saints were
   tempted. They were persuaded to

   sin by Satan, by the world and by the propensities of their nature. And
   of all the blood-redeemed host it must be said, "they were tempted."
   Ought not this fact restrain every man from a self-indulgent despair?
   Do you know what I mean? I mean this--a man says, "Well, I cannot help
   it! I am in such a place of temptation that if I give way I may well be
   excused." Not so, Sir! "They were tempted" and yet they did not fall,
   but held fast their integrity! They who today are waving the palm of
   victory were tempted even as you are and it is idle for you to say that
   victory is impossible seeing they have proved the reverse!

   Using the same weapons and helped by the same Spirit, your temptations,
   which are the same as theirs, will be overcome by you even as theirs
   were vanquished by them! Get up and fight like men! Dream no longer of
   impossibilities which might excuse you--what has been done by one, by
   the help of God, can be done by another! This leaves us without any
   excuse for yielding to temptation. I know we commonly think that if we
   can prove that we are tempted there is not much blame attached to us
   but it is not so! It is most true that those who tempt others are
   guilty of the greater sin, but the sin of those who are tempted and
   yield to the temptation is great enough--great enough to crush them
   into eternal destruction unless they repent of it! Other people have
   been tempted as you have been and yet they have resisted the temptation
   and have remained in obedience to God and, therefore, if you yield to
   the evil influence you are without excuse.

   The multitude of holy men and women who are now before the Throne of
   God are all witnesses against you, for they show what can be done and
   what can be done in you, too, the Grace of God being with you. This
   fact that all the saints have been tempted should put an end to all
   murmuring upon that score. Somebody says, "Mine is a hard lot! I have
   to follow Christ under great disadvantages. My foes are those of my own
   household." Yes, your lot may be difficult, but if you could just peep
   within the pearly gates and see that brilliant company who are the
   peers of the realm of Heaven, you would see none but those who once
   were tempted!

   Do you dare demand a better lot than theirs? Remember your Master was
   tempted and shall the disciple wish to be above his Master, or the
   servant above his Lord? Is there to be some easy bye-road to Heaven
   made for you, turned from end to end and rolled every morning?--

   "Must you be carried to the skies On flowery beds of ease While others
   fought to win the prize And sailed through bloody seas.9" You must not
   expect it! You must fight if you would reign! You must carry the cross
   as others carried it if you are like they, to wear the crown! The
   temptations which were endured by saints in all ages must forever
   prevent our complaining if hooks are baited for us and snares laid for
   our destruction!

   One sweet thought arises here. Since the best of saints were tempted,
   this prevents our conceiving that to be tempted is, in itself, a sin. I
   have known feeble-minded Christians bemoan themselves and cry, "If I
   were not exceedingly sinful I should not have these hideous thoughts
   and dreadful suggestions! If my heart were not full of evil, I should
   not have these blasphemous ideas forced into my poor, unwilling brain."
   Beloved, it is not so! If your heart were wholly the devil's, he might
   not care to worry you and, indeed, you would not be worried, but would
   love sin! It is because you are not his, because you are desperately
   struggling towards holiness and virtue that, therefore, he tempts you.
   It is no sin to be tempted--the sin is in yielding to temptation!

   Your Lord was tempted and yet in Him was no sin. Thrice did Satan
   assail our Lord--three evil courses did he plausibly suggest, but he
   found nothing in Him to work upon! There was no tinder for his sparks
   to light. Be, therefore, greatly comforted, by God's Grace, you who
   find evil thoughts rushing through your minds like a torrent. You try
   to fight against these temptations and yet they return again and again
   till your heart is well-near broken with them--do not, therefore,
   condemn yourself for them so long as you abhor them. You are not a
   castaway because you are tempted, for all the saints in Gory were
   tempted, too. Yes, I think, dear Friends, if any of us here present
   meet with great trials in life and with very strong temptations to turn
   back to the world--if God gives us Grace to keep towards the New
   Jerusalem we may even glory in these trials!

   We ought to pray, "Lead us not into temptation," for temptation is not
   to be sought for but to be looked upon as an evil, seeing that flesh is
   frail. But when it assumes the form of persecution and our Lord helps
   us to endure it, steadfast in the faith, we may even rejoice and leap
   for joy! If your name is slandered, or you become a loser in wage, or
   in estate, or in comfort for Christ's sake, you may greatly
   rejoice--for now you have fellowship with Jesus and His suffering
   follow-

   ers! You are entering the confederacy of the bravest of the brave. Now
   shall you share in "that lordlier chivalry" which belongs not to mailed
   knights, but to spirits purified and ennobled by the Holy Spirit! These
   are the blessed ones who endure temptation, who, when they are tried,
   shall receive the Crown of Life which fades not away! Forget not, then,
   the universal truth of the statement before us--"They were tempted."

   II. Secondly, let us consider THE UNLIMITED BREADTH OF THE STATEMENT.
   "They were tempted"--it

   does not say how. If one form of temptation had been mentioned, we
   should have surmised that they did not suffer in other ways, but when
   the statement is, "they were tempted," we shall not be wrong in
   concluding that they were tried in any and every form. Whatever form
   temptation may take, in some or in all the saints, that temptation has
   been endured. We may say of Christ's mystical body as we may say of
   Christ's self--"tempted in all points like as we are." Brothers and
   Sisters, the saints who are in Heaven were tempted in all ways!

   They were tempted by threats, but they were equally tempted by
   promises. They were put into prison, or they were banished. They were
   deprived of their goods and of their good names, but they stood fast
   and firm and would not yield up Christ, threaten as men might. Then
   they were tried by bribes--if they would forsake Christ and turn from
   the Truth of God they would be rich and honorable, they would be
   restored to their families, they would have, in some cases, every
   indulgence which the monarch could grant. They were equally deaf to
   either form of solicitation--they could not be driven and they could
   not be drawn! However the net might be spread they could not be taken
   in it.

   Standing at the stake, with the flames kindling and the firewood
   beginning to burn, the tempting monk has held up the crucifix and said,
   "Kiss it! Kiss it and your life shall be given you and you shall have
   great honors!" But they put away the idol from them and would not
   dishonor God by worshipping any material substance, whatever it might
   be. Or else the martyr, on his way to die, has been confronted by his
   wife and children, kneeling down and praying their father to have pity
   upon them, if none upon himself, and not to die and leave a widow and
   fatherless children. But though natural love struggled in their hearts,
   they leaped over that temptation, for they loved Christ better than
   their dearest relatives. They were tempted in the most subtle
   fashion--reason and rhetoric, threat and scorn, bribe and blandishment
   have all been used and used in vain. Against them the enemy has sent
   forth the arrow which flies by day and the pestilence which walks in
   darkness, but the Lord has kept their soul alive and they have
   glorified His name!

   Yet very sorely "they were tempted." They were tempted both with trials
   peculiar to themselves and with trials common to us all. We are apt,
   sometimes, to say that this age is not congenial to the strength of
   Grace and I think there is truth in the remark. We are a set of dwarfs
   and it seems hard to grow to the stature of a man in Christ Jesus in
   the atmosphere which daily surrounds us. We have fallen upon an evil
   age in which principle is treated like a football in the streets and
   bluster rules the hour. But the ages in which saints lived long ago had
   their peculiar temptations, too, and they were tempted. Every period
   since the world began has had its own form of spiritual danger--as
   weapons of war have changed so have temptations--but the old enmity
   remains.

   Not always does the swordsman make his cut at the head. Sometimes he
   stabs at the heart, or at another time he drives at the feet--always
   aiming to wound, but not always aiming at the same part of the man. One
   age is dark and ignorance would chill the heart; another is
   philosophical and by its false wisdom would overlay the Gospel. The
   points from which the wind blows may differ, but it always blows
   against the servants of God who are traveling to Heaven. Say not
   therefore, O child of God, that others who lived before you were not
   tempted as you are, for they endured temptations which to them were as
   keen and as powerful as any which have fallen on you!

   They had, also, special temptations arising out of their individual
   constitutions. We have, every one of us, some weak point. One man is
   not readily made angry, but he is too cold. Another is sensitive, but
   he is too speedily wrathful. One man is full of love and affection, but
   he lacks decision. Another is resolute, but fails in tenderness. Side
   by side with the special excellence of any character we usually
   discover a remarkable weakness calling for great watchfulness! And of
   all those who are now in Heaven it may be said they were
   tempted--tempted in some characteristic point and with some besetting
   sin.

   Beloved, if you have to endure the same, mark well that you follow a
   well-trod path. As they had their peculiar temptations, so they had the
   common trials of the most ordinary life. Look at Abraham--not only does
   he stand alone in the sacrifice of Isaac, but he stands with us in our
   common afflictions. He is tried in his relatives--his nephew Lot is
   ungrateful to him and leaves him. He is tried in his servants--the
   family is set by the ears by Hagar. He is tried in his wife,

   for she complains against him wrongfully. He is tried in his children,
   for Ishmael mocks Isaac. His dwelling in tents brought with it quite as
   much discomfort and trial as our dwelling in houses. Flocks and herds
   involve as much care as shops and workrooms.

   Just such domestic troubles as you and I experience were known to Jacob
   and David. One man is very like another and nothing can be more unwise
   than to set up saintly men who lived ages ago upon a sort of shelf, as
   if they were unapproachable and inimitable and belonged to a different
   race! These heroes are our brothers, their battles are our battles,
   their victory shall be ours. Our Divine Master Himself, when He was
   assailed by the devil in the wilderness, was attacked by those same
   temptations which have been used against us--we, too, have been tempted
   to use wrong means to supply our pressing needs, to presume upon the
   Providence of God and to commit idolatry in order to gratify ambition.
   These are arrows which have rattled on the harness of many soldiers of
   the Cross.

   Our Lord Jesus, the Captain of our salvation, bore the brunt of the
   battle and in the matter of temptation He condescended to fight upon
   the same level with ourselves. "He was tempted in all points like as we
   are, yet without sin." So that the text stands good in all its length
   and breadth that all those who have won the everlasting Victory were
   tempted, even as we are now.

   III. Thirdly, let us notice THE SPECIAL POINT OF THE TRIAL. All these
   temptations, according to the connection of our text, were aimed at the
   faith of these holy men. Paul is writing of the victories and
   sufferings of faith and, therefore, we are sure that these temptations
   were a test and trial of their faith. It is wonderful how God takes
   care that the victories of faith shall somehow or other be kept in
   mind. There was a period after the Prophets had ceased to prophesy and
   before Christ came in which the Israelite church had to contend against
   antichrist and other enemies. In the Apocrypha you have the account of
   some few of the martyrdoms of those who held fast to God and to His
   Truth.

   They are not put in canonical Scripture--they neither belong to the Old
   Testament nor to the New--but here Paul immortalizes them, for the Lord
   will have them remembered. Those who were stoned and sawn asunder for
   the Truth's sake shall not be forgotten. If the details are not given,
   they shall yet be recorded in the gross on the sacred pages. Since that
   time, dear Friends, as if Paul had been writing prophecy rather than
   history, the people of God have had to pass through sufferings which,
   if I were to repeat them now, would break your hearts with grief
   because of the horrors of cruelty which human ingenuity has invented.

   Man has seemed to turn into a devil and sink below a fiend in the
   barbarities which he has perpetrated against the servants of God. All
   this has been aimed at the destruction of faith. The Jews were tempted
   to worship idols--they must offer incense to a false God--but they
   would not. In later years Christians must pay homage to the image of
   the em-peror--this they would not do--they would die a thousand deaths
   sooner than worship a false God! By-and-by they were called upon to
   deny the Deity of Christ and by tens of thousands they perished sooner
   than deny that fact! In later years it came to this--that they must
   submit to superstition--they must assert that they believed in
   transubstantiation, which they could not believe in, nor thus insult
   their God!

   They must submit themselves to men who said they were priests and could
   forgive their sins--which they felt was a forsaking of the great High
   Priest to think of doing it--and so they died rather than deny the
   faith. The story of the lives of these heroes is recorded in such
   half-inspired books as Foxe's "Book of Martyrs" and the like. Read it
   and let your children read it till both they and you have learned
   fidelity to Christ! The main point of the adversary's attack was always
   their faith--therefore let us learn where to set our guard. Let us see
   to it that we become strong in faith, for that is true strength. Feed
   your faith well. Know the Truth of God and know it thoroughly. Read the
   Scriptures and understand them. Make sure of the eternal Truths of God.

   Live much upon the promises of future bliss. A sight of the unfading
   crown will make you cheerfully forego the withering flowers of earth.
   The sorrows of the way will grow light as the eternal weight of Glory
   is revealed. You will think less of the commendation or censure of men
   if your ears already hear the great Master saying, "Well done, good and
   faithful servant."

   IV. I cannot dwell long on this point, though I had wished to do so,
   but must now call your attention, in the fourth place, to THE INTENSITY
   OF THIS TRIAL. That I gather from the position of our text, which is
   very strange. They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted,
   were slain with sword. It has seemed to commentators to be so singular
   that to be "tempted" should be, as it were, sandwiched in between,
   "sawn asunder" and being "slain with the

   sword," that they have thought there must be an error in the text.
   Certainly at the first blush, the words look rather out of place, but
   they are not so. Some learned men have imagined another Greek word to
   be the correct one, since it involves a very slight alteration and then
   the passage would run--"They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they
   were burnt, they were slain with the sword."

   I do not see any reason for desiring an alteration. It seems to me to
   be plain that the original is, "they were tempted," and what is written
   must stand. The more we think of it, the more we shall see that being
   tempted is worthy to be put side by side with being sawn asunder and
   being slain with the sword, for many of those who are daily tormented
   with temptations will tell you that it is as painful to bear as any
   form of death. If you live in a place where you hear little else but
   blasphemy from morning to night you will soon say, "I think I should
   prefer being in a prison to this. The cut of a whip or the wound of a
   sword would scarcely cause more pain than to hear the name of Jesus
   Christ profaned and to see every holy and precious thing trampled on!"

   When the ungodly persecute cruelly, as they can do, even now, without
   violating the law of man, they can tease and worry your very soul. They
   can embitter every morsel that you eat, make home to be a
   torture-chamber and the workroom an inquisition. They will maliciously
   track you in all your steps with jests and jeers and slanders and hard
   speeches and make you live like Marcus Arethusa, among the bees which,
   at last, stung him to death. Believe me, some of God's people have
   found that to be tempted in that sense has been as bad as to be stoned,
   or to be slain with a sword! In fact, there are times when they have
   said, "If we could be taken out and our heads could be cut off at one
   stroke with a sword, it would be a happy release from this life-long
   agony."

   Alas for gentle, timid, loving spirits who have to endure such
   temptation! I think Paul did well to put this here, not only because of
   the painfulness of it, but because of the danger of it, for it is
   certain that under temptation of the more insidious kind more professed
   Christians have been led away than ever were frightened from the faith
   by racks, or torments, or fear of death. It is a very sad fact that
   when Queen Mary died there were persons lying in prison condemned for
   heresy who had, some of them, been great sufferers for the faith and
   bold confessors of it and yet when released they did not abide in their
   steadfastness.

   Queen Mary died and Elizabeth ascended the throne and they obtained
   their liberty and, alas, some of them, returning to the comforts of
   home, became altogether worldly persons and forsook the faith for which
   once they would have even dared to die. I have known some unhappy cases
   of the same kind, where persons have been persecuted by their families
   for following Christ and have stood up for Him right manfully so that I
   have felt great admiration for them for their consistent courage. I
   have lived to see these very individuals delivered from the yoke of
   bondage, able to start in life for themselves and to do exactly as they
   pleased and, alas, soon after persecution ceased they have grown cold
   and have forsaken the ways of God! What a strange creature is man!

   Lord, what a deceitful heart I have! O that You would search it and try
   it, lest it be so that I follow You in stormy weather, but leave You
   when the south wind blows! I think the Apostle put in this clause just
   where we find it because more deadly to the Church have been the
   blandishments of the world's wealth than all the raging of her cruelty.
   Her stakes, her racks, her gallows have never injured the Church so
   much as her witcheries, her smiles, her fashions and her patronage. Yet
   this was borne by saints of old, for, "they were tempted." "Well," says
   one, "you describe these Christian people as having had very hard times
   of it, for they were tempted and tempted very severely, too." Yes, it
   is true, but we do not pity one of them. If you saw those gallant men
   who wear the Victoria cross for valor and you were told of their perils
   and sufferings, you would not pity them.

   They could not have worn the coveted cross given them by their Queen if
   they had not bravely endured hardship and peril. We do not pity men who
   have performed daring exploits, nor may we pity those servants of God
   who suffered the utmost cruelties, but now rest from their labors and
   wear their honors in Heaven. The question is--Can you aspire to take a
   place among them? To be a true Christian is no small thing and, before
   you pretend to be a follower of Jesus, count the cost! Are you willing
   to endure temptation without yielding? Can you scorn the world's bribes
   and defy its threats? Will you set your face like a flint for Christ
   and holiness? Has Grace made you a lion-like man? Have you a strong
   determination worked in you by the Holy Spirit? If not, you may run
   well for a time, but you will turn back and prove an apostate. I pray
   God that you may be of that noble stock which the Lord has chosen and
   may have in you that noble na-

   ture which only the Holy Spirit can impart, so that, though you shall
   be tempted, you shall hold out till life's last hour, invincible
   through the Grace of God!

   I want, in conclusion, to answer the question which naturally
   arises--Why, then, does God permit His people to encounter so much
   temptation? Why is the road to Heaven so beset with foes? I answer that
   there are a great many replies to that question, for the Lord answers
   many designs at one and the same time. First, persecution and
   temptation are a sort of sieve to sift the Church of God. As it is, we
   have enough hypocrites among us and if the way to Heaven were strewn
   all along with loaves and fishes, we should have the devil, himself,
   going on pilgrimage! There must be these fiery persecutions so that the
   hypocrites may be purged out. I guarantee you there were not many
   hypocrites in the catacombs of Rome when, to be a Christian involved
   almost certain death! They crept into their assemblies at the dead of
   night and there gathered to sing hymns to the name of Jesus and few
   were the traitors' tongues which joined in the singing!

   When in our own country any man who had a Bible must die for it and,
   therefore, men hid their Bibles behind the wainscot, or under the
   floor, few were very eager for Bible-reading. The mocking, the jesting,
   the jeering which goes on in the world is the sieve constantly moving
   to shake off the chaff and let the good wheat remain. If we could stop
   that winnowing fan we should hardly wish to do so! I am sure if I could
   give some of you new converts a pass from here to Heaven so that nobody
   should ever laugh at you and you should never suffer anything for
   Christ, I would not do it! I feel I would be doing you a serious injury
   if I could secure you against every trial.

   Think of a soldier when he enlists. Suppose he should say to the
   sergeant, "Sergeant, will you give me a guarantee that I shall never
   fight?" I think the officer would reply, "You had better not enlist."
   Even so I say to you we cannot guarantee you that you shall not be
   tempted and if you need such a guarantee as that, you are not the kind
   of man we want--you are not the sort of man that is ever likely to win
   the unfading Crown! Trial and temptation also discover the reality of
   conversion. Look at this. Here is a man ridiculed for his religion and
   for his sobriety. He will not touch a drop of the drink which formerly
   cast him down to his destruction and, therefore, his fellow workmen
   laugh at him. All sorts of epithets are hurled at him while he is at
   work.

   He goes to a place of worship on Sunday and for this he must be jeered
   at to the last degree. Who is this man that bears this so patiently?
   Why, the very man who, 12 months ago, could drink as much as any of
   them and used to jeer at others! The very man who for 20 years before
   never entered the house of God! Now, the fact that he can stand against
   temptation is one of the very best evidences that he is born again and
   made a new creature in Christ Jesus! And those who see such a change
   confess that this is the finger of God. What else could have changed
   him so completely as to make him stand against the very thing which he
   took part in so short a time ago? We may thank God for the temptations
   since it helps to evidence the reality of the conversion!

   Again, it is by this that men are left without excuse, inasmuch as they
   refuse the Light of God. I sometimes wonder why ungodly men cannot let
   Christian people alone. We do not interfere with you! Have we not as
   much right to do as we like as you have to do what you like? But no!
   The moment a Christian appears among working men, they are all upon him
   as though they were so many dogs worrying a hare! What does this show
   but that they know the Truth of God and hate it? They know the Light,
   but would gladly quench it and, therefore, they put from them the
   candle which God sends them. They treat His blessing as if it were a
   curse! Did you ever read in the Scriptures of God's thinking better of
   men than they deserved? "No," you say, "that cannot be!"

   Yes, but there is a case, a parabolical case, of course, where the Lord
   is represented as judging men too easily. "Last of all he sent unto
   them his son, saying, they will reverence my son." But they did not
   reverence him! They took the heir and slew him and cast him out of the
   vineyard. There are people of God who are naturally so amiable, kind
   and good that you feel sure all must love and esteem them and yet,
   because of their religion, even such must be persecuted. The beloved
   Brother cannot escape without sarcasm. The dear Sister that was
   everything, before, must now be made the subject of jeers and the
   husband or the wife, however much beloved, is not spared. This leaves
   the ungodly altogether without excuse--it is God's purpose that it
   should do so!

   Meanwhile, it does saints good, for painful as it is to them, it drives
   them to prayer. Many a man lives near to God in prayer who would not
   have done so if he had enjoyed an easier position. His prayerfulness
   strengthens him! His having to summon Divine aid to sustain him under
   trial makes him grow in faith and in every Grace! And he becomes a
   better Christian. I believe that persecution is overruled by God for
   displaying the work of the Divine Spirit. Men see in Chris-

   tian patience, in Christian fortitude, in Christian courage and in
   Christian zeal what the Holy Spirit can work, even in such poor raw
   material as our human nature! God is magnified by the successful
   struggling of His people out of love to

   His name.

   Moreover, Brothers and Sisters, the life of the Church is the life of
   Christ extended and drawn out in His people. He was "holy, harmless,
   undefiled and separate from sinners," yet He, "endured such
   contradiction of sinners against Himself," and if we keep close to
   Christ we must expect to share His lot. Ours should be the prolonged
   echoes of the music of Christ's life, "linked sweetness long drawn
   out." Oh that God would help us till Christ Himself shall come to keep
   up the blessed strain! It seems to me the trials and the temptations of
   this life are all making us fit for the life to come--building up a
   character for eternity. You have been in a piano plant--did you ever go
   there for the sake of music? Go into the tuning room and you will say,
   "My dear Sir, this is a dreadful place to be in! I cannot bear it! I
   thought you made music here." They say, "No, we do not produce music
   here, we make the instruments and tune them here and in the process
   much discord is forthcoming."

   Such is the Church of God on earth. The Lord makes the instruments down
   here and tunes them and a great deal of discord is easily perceptible,
   but it is all necessary to prepare us for the everlasting harmonies up
   yonder. Have you thought what a wonderful creature a man is--a perfect
   man, made fit to dwell in Heaven? He is the last product of Divine
   wisdom, the noblest work of God! There is an angel, he is perfectly
   holy, but he never knew what sin was and there is little wonder that he
   clings to that which has been his nature these many centuries! Besides,
   He is not encumbered by a body of dust, full of passions and appetites
   which are the inlets of sin.

   But here is a being with a soul, encumbered with materialism and it has
   known sin, known it terribly and yet it is forever bound to do right
   beyond fear of turning aside! How is this to be achieved? Take away its
   free agency, says one. No, that would spoil it! It would be no longer a
   man if free agency were destroyed. This being is perfectly free to do
   whatever he pleases throughout eternity and yet he will never wish to
   do a wrong thing again! It is a wonderful work for God to fashion such
   a creature! He begins to do it in regeneration and continues the work
   in sanctification--and all the endurance of trial and all the patience
   manifested by the tried ones work together to prepare a character which
   can endure the strain of everlasting bliss and perform the holy service
   incident thereto!

   I speak for every Christian here--I am to stand, one day, so near to
   God that between Him and me there will be but one Person and that
   Person the Lord Jesus Christ, my Lord and Mediator! I am, in Christ, to
   have dominion over all the works of God's hands and to be crowned with
   glory and honor! Angels are to be my servants and Heaven my
   inheritance! Shall I never grow proud? Shall no self-exaltation creep
   in? No! The character will be fixed for holiness as though engraved in
   eternal brass and yet the man will be free! It may be that all the
   afflictions and temptations which God permits to pass over us here
   below are forming us for eternal bliss. Thus is the corn ripening for
   the garner, the fruit mellowing for the basket! Here the engraving tool
   and the hammer bring out the beauties which shall shine in the courts
   of the Lord forever when, of us, also, the record will be
   written--"they were tempted."

A Powerful Reason For Coming To Christ

   (No. 1529)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MARCH 21, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "A great multitude, when they had heard what great things He did, came
   unto Him." Mark 3:8.

   THE opposition of the great ones of the earth did not, after all,
   hinder the cause of Christ. The Pharisees, who were the leaders of
   religious thought, combined with the Herodians, who were the court
   party, to destroy Jesus, but at the very moment when their wrath had
   reached its highest pitch the crowd about the Savior's Person was
   greater than ever. Let us not, therefore, dear Friends, be at all
   dismayed if great men and learned men and nominally religious men,
   should oppose the simple Gospel of Christ! All the world is not bound
   up in a Pharisee's phylactery, nor held in chains by a philosopher's
   new fancy. If some will not have our Savior, others will--God's eternal
   purpose will stand and the kingdom of His Anointed shall come.

   If our Lord Jesus is rejected by the great, nevertheless the common
   people hear Him gladly. To the poor, the Gospel is preached and it is
   His joy and His delight that out of them He still gathers a company
   who, though poor in this world, are rich in faith and give glory to
   God. I would have you, Beloved, count upon opposition and regard it as
   a token of coming blessings. Dread not the black cloud, it does but
   prognosticate a shower. March may howl and bluster and April may dampen
   all things with its rains, but the May flowers and the autumn's harvest
   of varied fruits will come and come by this very means. Go on and serve
   your God in the serenity of holy confidence and you shall live to see
   that the hand of the Lord is not to be turned back, though the kings of
   the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together.

   Those who came to Christ in such great multitudes did not all come from
   right motives and I shall not assume that they did. Some came from idle
   curiosity, no doubt. Others came to listen to what He had to say, but
   were not prepared to believe in Him. We know that many came to be fed
   with loaves and fishes, swayed by the most mercenary motives. Still, in
   the case now under notice, large numbers came to Jesus because they had
   heard of the great things which He did, hoping that He would do
   something of the same kind for them, for multitudes of those who came
   were sick folk, plague-smitten, stricken with disease and they came
   thinking that by touching Him they might be delivered from all their
   sufferings. This gift they gained and glorified the name of the Lord!

   I shall not, therefore, stay to divide out the characters which made up
   the crowd, but remind you that we must never expect that all who come
   to hear the Gospel will receive it. Just as Jesus went up into the
   mountain and there called out to Himself whom He would, so does He form
   His Church, which is an assembly of called-out ones whom the Sovereign
   Lord selects from the congregation of hearers that they may become a
   Church of Believers. The process of selection and separation is always
   going on and the great heap which lies on the threshing floor is being
   daily winnowed to divide the golden grain from the worthless chaff.

   For our present purpose, only, we shall just now view those who
   literally came to Christ as the types of those who come spiritually.
   Many, I trust, who are present at this time will come to Jesus for the
   same reason that these people came, namely, because they have heard of
   the great things which have been done by Him. So to our work at once.
   Three things are before us. The first is the attraction--"They had
   heard what great things He did." Secondly, the gathering--"They came
   unto Him." And thirdly, the context furnishes us with this--the result
   of the attraction and the gathering. We find it written, "He had healed
   many; insomuch that they pressed upon Him for to touch Him, as many as
   had plagues."

   I. Here is the ATTRACTION--"They had heard what great things He did."
   My dear Hearers, the case of these people is parallel with your own!
   There must be very few of you here but what have not heard of the great
   things which Jesus Christ has done. Let us note, first, that these
   people had heard with somewhat of a believing ear. Stories floated
   about concerning one who had healed blindness, palsy, leprosy and they
   accepted the statements as facts. A lame man told how

   he had been made to leap like a rabbit and a blind man declared that
   his eyes had been opened--and as these wonders passed from mouth to
   mouth these people believed them to be true.

   I know that even those of you who are not converted yet, believe what
   is recorded in these four Gospels concerning the miracles that Jesus
   worked. You are persuaded that the records are authentic. You believe
   that the Lord Jesus did heal the sick and that He did even raise the
   dead and cast out devils. You also accept the grand Gospel statement
   that He is able to save unto the uttermost those that come unto God by
   Him. Believing so much as that, you ought to believe a good deal more
   and I pray the Holy Spirit, now, to lead you to that farther faith. If
   you have come as far as that, the most reasonable thing to do is to go
   to Him with your own case and trust Him to heal you!

   I am persuaded that I may go very far with many here present in a
   statement of their beliefs. You believe that Jesus Christ has done
   great spiritual wonders for multitudes. You have been told of great
   sinners whose hard hearts have been softened, whose characters have
   been changed, whose lives have been renewed, whose sins have been
   forgiven! You have met with such, have you not? The deed of Grace was
   performed upon your own brother, perhaps, or upon some intimate friend,
   or some person of public notoriety. You know many such cases and you
   believe them to be genuine wonders of Divine Grace. You do not think
   that conversion is all a delusion--you have not reached that degree of
   unbelief. Indeed, instead of unbelief, you are filled with ardent
   admiration and feel a measure of desire to be saved yourself--and while
   sitting in this house you have often said, "Yes, I believe it is so. Oh
   that the mighty Grace of God would renew me and that I could touch the
   hem of the Savior's garment that He might save even me."

   Believing so much as you do, you ought, in all reason, to believe more.
   I mean you should go on to trust Him who has worked these great things
   and place your own case in His hands and leave it there. This is the
   legitimate course to pursue. A man believes a certain medicine to have
   worked great cures and he knows that he, himself, is sick of the
   disease which it is meant to heal. Why, it seems as if no one needs to
   say, "The next step is that you should try that medicine upon
   yourself." Yet it grieves me that so many of you do not proceed to this
   saving point, but linger on the borders of faith. You see the river of
   the Water of Life and wish to drink, for you are sure that it would
   quench your thirst and yet you are in danger of perishing in sight of
   the flowing stream! O, Holy Spirit, remove the madness of sin and teach
   men true wisdom!

   The many who came to Jesus felt themselves drawn because they had heard
   of the great things which He had done and believed them. They
   proceeded, however, to the second step which I have already indicated,
   for they drew from what they had heard, an argument of hope. They said,
   "Has He done these great things to others? Why should He not work the
   same gracious miracles upon us?" The palsied man said, "He that was
   sick as I am has been recovered! Surely, if I could get near to Jesus
   and could catch His eye, He would restore me." The blind said, "He
   healed one like myself--oh, if I could but sit where He passes by I
   would cry, 'You Son of David, have mercy on me,' and He would open my
   eyes, too."

   They could not be, at once, sure that He would heal them, for that He
   works a cure in one is not, in itself, a proof that He will work upon
   another--but they were further informed that He delighted in mercy and
   that He was gentle and gracious and easily entreated and, therefore,
   they concluded that if such an One had power to work such beneficent
   miracles and evidently had a will to work them, they had but to come to
   Him and they would be partakers of His healing power! O that my
   unconverted hearers would act reasonably at this time and draw the same
   conclusion!

   I pray you, dear Friends, see how sensible these people were that you
   may imitate them! To me it seems as plain as the working out of a
   proposition in mathematics. Jesus has saved such as I am, therefore He
   can save me. To believe in Him is as reasonable an act as to eat that
   which is good when you know it is good and know that you need it! Or to
   drink that which quenches thirst, when you perceive that it is suitable
   for that purpose and that you are in need of drink. O that your hearts
   would say--Jesus Christ has worked great deeds of Grace! He is
   evidently willing to work more--let me, then, come to Him and trust
   myself in His hands! If this is a time of cool, collected thought and
   the Holy Spirit works in us wisdom, it will again happen that, "A great
   multitude, when they had heard of the great things which Jesus did,
   came unto Him."

   One more step should be mentioned. No doubt these persons were partly
   urged to come to Him by their own sad condition. Some of them were full
   of pain through bodily plagues and others suffered poverty and
   wretchedness through being blind, crippled, lame, or withered and they
   were anxious to be delivered from their infirmity and the poverty which
   came of it. Being convinced that their cases were similar to those
   which had been healed by Christ, they felt an eager de-

   sire to see what He could do for them. Now, I know that I may call my
   hearers to Christ till I lose my voice, but none will come but those
   who feel that they need Him. But, my dear unconverted Hearers, you need
   Him whether you know it or not!

   There is a disease upon you which has already brought you down to
   spiritual death and will bring you down to Hell before long. The most
   moral of you; the most amiable of you, unless Jesus shall look upon you
   in love, is carrying about within himself a plague of the heart which
   will be your eternal ruin! Jesus must save you, or you are lost! There
   is no hope for any man among you except it comes from Him. Do you know
   this? If so, come at once to the Savior! Do you not know it? Then
   believe it to be so, for so it is and let the conviction lead you to
   seek His face. But remember, these people did not only come because
   they were sick, or because they felt they were sick, for they had long
   known and felt their sicknesses and had remained at home. Or they had
   resorted to other physicians, or to Bethesda's pool, or to some other
   famous fountain. They came to Jesus because, knowing and feeling their
   need, they also perceived that Jesus was able to meet their case.

   Come, then, to Christ, O my sin-stricken Hearers, because, be your
   condition what it may, He can meet it! Are you troubled with hardness
   of heart? By His Spirit He can take away the heart of stone and give
   you a heart of flesh! Is your difficulty unbelief? You cannot see the
   Truth of God, but the Lord Jesus can open the eyes of him that was born
   blind! Is it a case of lack of power? Is your hand withered? The Lord
   can bid the withered hand be stretched out and it shall be done! It is
   not possible that there should be any moral or spiritual disease about
   any one of you that will baffle the power of my great Lord and Master!
   If you do but come to Him, He can and will make you every whit whole.
   He has already dealt with cases like yours, as bad as yours, as
   desperate as yours--in the record of His cures there are instances
   parallel to your own and some which even surpass them in difficulty.
   Depend on it, He is able to do, again, what He has already done, for He
   is the same yesterday, today and forever!

   His arm is not shortened that He cannot save! He can reach as far as
   sin can go and draw back those whom Satan has driven to the Pit's
   mouth. Now, be reasonable and act upon this fact. May the Spirit of God
   lead you in the way of understanding and then you will say, today, "I,
   also, will join that multitude who, having heard of the great things
   which Jesus did, came to Him." God grant it may be so! Yes, He will
   grant it, for His Word shall not return unto Him void.

   II. Secondly, I shall ask you to think of THE GATHERING. We have seen
   the attraction, now let us see what it drew together. "They came unto
   Him." Observe, then, that hearing did not content them. I wish I could
   say this of all my hearers. These people heard the story of what Christ
   had done and I should not wonder but what they said, "It is good news!
   Say it in our ears a second time." They were told that He had opened
   the eyes of a blind man and a blind man who heard it, cried out,
   "Gladsome tidings! Tell me that again." I should not wonder if that
   blind man went many times to the house of the person who reported the
   cure and said, "Tell me again of this matter."

   The woman, too, who was sick with internal disease, said, "You told us
   of one that was healed. Tell us of that marvel again." Yes, but what
   would you have thought if they had kept on, week after week, saying,
   "Tell us that story! Tell us that story!" and then had gone home and
   said, "We feel so much better! We feel comforted by hearing this good
   news"? What fools they would have been to have been satisfied with a
   mere report of other people's cures without going to the great
   Physician to obtain healing for themselves! Did you not sing the other
   day--

   "Tell me the story often, For I forget so soon, The early dew of
   morning Has passed away at noon"?

   Why should you be told that tale so often? Will you never draw the
   inference that Jesus is able to save you and will you never go to Him
   for yourselves? I am afraid that some of you are getting satisfied with
   coming to the Tabernacle and that you are beginning to think, "There is
   hope for me. I always hear the Word of God. I am a regular hearer of
   the Gospel of Jesus."

   Yes, but that is not it. Those who are hearers, only, are not blessed
   in the deed. A hungry man hears that there is bread given away to the
   poor and he says, "Tell me where the food is given and on what terms
   and I will hasten to get it, for I am famished." Do you think the poor
   starving wretch will stop here a week and be refreshed by merely
   hearing about bread? Not he! He will die if he does that. He may,
   perhaps, ask again for information and say, "Tell me once more! Give me
   plain directions where to go and I will hasten to be fed as others have
   been," but he will not expect to fill

   his empty stomach with merely hearing the news! He is not so stupid as
   that! I am compelled to feel that some of you are very short of sense
   when you are dealing with your souls. Why, some of you might almost
   sing--

   "Tell me the same old story, Though you ha ve cause to fear That I
   shall miss of Glory, And die with Grace so near."

   O that this fooling would come to an end! Think me not harsh, I am but
   honest! It is fooling and nothing better, to go on hearing the Word of
   God and refusing to obey its call. May God's Grace lead you to come to
   Jesus at once. O do not be hearers only! Turn your faces Christward and
   accept His great salvation!

   Observe, next, that these people did not wait until Jesus came to them.
   That we are to wait till Jesus comes to us is a common error--a sort of
   orthodox wickedness, a rebellious unbelief dressed out as humble
   submissiveness. I have known this preached--that we are to wait at the
   pool of the ordinances, in the hope that one of these days the angel
   may trouble the pool and we shall step in. Those who talk so are not,
   as a rule, the most successful of soul-winners and that fact reminds me
   of a story I have heard of a Scotchman who had attended the ministry of
   an Episcopal minister for some years. At last Donald forsook the
   Episcopal Church and when he was missed, the pastor came to him. "Why
   don't you come to the church, Donald?" "Because I want to be saved and
   I get no good with you."

   "Ah," said the bishop, "you should wait at the pool." "I have been
   waiting at the pool a long time," said Donald, "a very long while and
   no good has come of it." "But, Donald, you know the man who waited was
   healed at last." "Ah, well, Sir, but he had some encouragement, for he
   saw some step in before him, but all these years that I have waited at
   your pool I have never seen one step in yet and therefore I will wait
   no longer." Donald was right--no man can afford to run so terrible a
   risk as to remain in disobedience in the bare hope of some unpromised
   salvation. The Gospel narrative does not teach us to wait at the pool!
   I want to call particular attention to that fact.

   See the crowd lying around the pool of Bethesda? What did Jesus do when
   He came walking along that morning through the five porches? Listen,
   you sick folk, still waiting at the pool! Does He say, "Wait
   patiently"? Not a word of it! But, singling out a man who was among the
   most despairing, He said, "Rise, take up your bed and walk." That is
   the Gospel! It is a Divine command to believe and live! Our Lord comes
   here at this moment by His Gospel and He does not say to you, "Wait,
   wait, wait," but, "Behold, now is the accepted time! Now is the day of
   salvation!" Believe in Jesus now, for He that believes in Him has
   everlasting life! Look to Him and be saved! The Gospel which is
   preached in your ears is a voice from Jesus, Himself, attended by His
   own Divine power and if you feel it to be such, you will obey it and
   you shall find salvation now and wait no longer! These people did not
   wait till Jesus journeyed into their own regions, but when they heard
   what great things He did, they went to Him! May you be led of the
   Spirit to do the same.

   Note, again, that these people did not stop at His disciples. Satan
   tries to keep men from Christ by pointing them to ministers,
   evangelists, or other eminent Believers. Persons are impressed under a
   sermon and they say, "I should like to speak with some Christian man."
   That is very good, but after all it is not the thing which is commanded
   by the Gospel. You are to believe in the Master and it will not suffice
   to speak to the servants. "But I would like to go into the enquiry
   room," says one. Very well, I do not condemn that action, but the best
   enquiry room for a seeking sinner is his own bedchamber, where he seeks
   the Lord at once, with no one between him and his Redeemer. Why, if you
   could pick out the most earnest and thoughtful divines that ever lived
   and you could have 12 of them locked up at home so that you might go
   and talk to them all day and all night long, it would not be worth one
   bad farthing to you and it might even be an injury to you if it kept
   you from going straight to Jesus Christ!

   There is no salvation in men! And ministers must not be mistaken for
   priests. I shake off the thought of being a priest as Paul shook off
   the viper from his hand! I have often said I would sooner be called
   devil, than "priest" if by that word is meant that I have any
   priesthood beyond that which belongs to all my fellow Christians, or
   any power to forgive sin, or to impart Grace. My ministry is for the
   extolling of Jesus and not for the magnifying of myself and my
   Brothers! I dare not say, "Behold the priesthood! Behold the Church!
   Behold the sacraments!" My one business is to cry, "Behold the Lamb of
   God!" I point you away from all ministries to Jesus Christ, the
   Minister of the New Covenant, who alone can save your souls!

   These people were wise in not staying with the disciples, for they
   could not meet their varied needs. They did not rest in the society of
   the virgin mother, nor in that of Peter, or James, or John--they
   hastened at once to the Lord Jesus Himself to touch His blessed Person
   for themselves. In this I would have you all imitate them. O that you
   would--

   "Steal away steal away to Jesus,

   Steal away home

   For Jesus waits to save you."

   Go to no one else but Jesus, for the great things that He did and not
   the poor things that such worms as we are can ever do, should raise
   hope in your bosoms! Observe, again, that these people who came to
   Jesus in such crowds must have left their businesses. I do not know
   what became of their farms, their olive gardens, their cattle, their
   shops, but they certainly left them to journey to Jesus. We do not
   commend any man for neglecting his business and daily calling, but I
   will say this, that when a man's soul is not saved he cannot be blamed
   if he neglects everything till it is!

   That woman who came out in the morning with her water pot to draw water
   from the well was doing a very useful and proper action, for I dare say
   those at home needed water to drink. But after she had heard Christ
   speak, it is written, "The woman left her water pot." Some of those at
   home may have said, "Where is the water, mistress?" But she would
   reply, "I have not thought of the poor water pot. Come, see a Man that
   told me all things that I ever did! Is not this the Christ?" Ah, if you
   leave your water pots to find Christ, you may very well be excused! O
   working man in soul trouble, if you are out with a cart and the horse
   should stand still in the street while you breathe a prayer for
   salvation, who could blame you? If the engine paused while the stoker
   cried for mercy, or the shuttle lingered while the weaver begged for
   pardon, would there not be a justifiable excuse?

   If the shop shutters were kept up for an hour later than usual while
   the tradesman sought the Savior, yes, if the business of the
   Senate-house stood still and all the commerce of a nation stopped while
   but one soul sought Christ, it were worth while! For what human
   business can equal the salvation of the souls of men? Elections occupy
   men's thoughts just now, but what are all these compared with making
   your calling and election sure? You are candidates for Heaven and there
   is more importance in eternal election than in all other elections
   under Heaven, for when everything else shall have passed away, this
   must endure! See to the one thing necessary, with Mary, even if you do
   for a while neglect what Martha thinks to be the urgent demands of the
   household! Let your first care be for your soul, "For what shall it
   profit a man if he gains the whole world and lose his own soul?"

   Many of these people, too, came from a great distance. Some came from
   the south, from Judea. Others came from the north, from Tyre and Sidon.
   Some from across the river Jordan. Others from the hills of Edom. Rough
   roads and deep rivers could not keep those back who resolved to come to
   Christ. O Souls, if you need Christ, let nothing hinder you! If there
   were seven Hells between a soul and Christ it were worth while for it
   to force its way through all their fires to get at Him--for when you
   get at Him there is salvation and eternal life! Rest not, I pray you,
   till over all impediments you have forced a way. There is a plenitude
   of mercy about our Lord Jesus which will well reward you for pressing
   towards Him. Oh, get to my Master, however far off you may be, for the
   sight of Him will well repay the weary journey!

   I delight to see the holy ingenuity of anxious minds when they are
   eager to find the Savior--they will do anything to obtain salvation! I
   remember that years ago, when Bibles were not so common as they are
   now, a very, very poor man who was impressed with his need of Christ,
   longed to read the Word of God and, therefore, he went to a shop to ask
   the price of a second-hand Bible--the cheapest, the oldest they had on
   hand. "Ah," said he, as he shook his head, "I have not money enough to
   buy it, but I will take great care of it if you will lend it to me from
   Saturday night till Monday morning. You won't miss the sale of it and I
   may read a part of it." As soon as He gained the friendly loan he gave
   himself up to the precious book till the moment he had to return it and
   so sought to find Christ!

   Ah, you have Bibles, some of you half-a-dozen of them, but you never
   look at them! The dust on the unread books condemns you! You take no
   trouble to reach the Savior! God save you from this carelessness and
   may you resolve to come to Jesus whoever may oppose. Be eager to listen
   to His Gospel, though you may have far to go to hear it and may be
   roughly squeezed in the crowd. When you hear the Gospel, cry to the
   Lord God for His blessing upon it! Though dark thoughts may gather and
   Satan may try to thrust you back, be not removed from your purpose.
   Make a push for Heaven and holiness! Never does the Lord work in any
   man a firm resolution to find the Savior and yet allow him to perish.

   One thing I want to call very particular attention to is this--these
   poor people came to Jesus with all their ailments about them. I know
   they did, because we read that they pressed upon Him to touch Him and
   He made them whole. Now, suppose they had said, "We will not come till
   we are recovered," then, of course, they needed not to come at all and
   our Lord would have been a superfluity to them! But no--he that was
   blind came blind, he who was lame hobbled as best he could and he who
   was palsied came shaking and trembling--but they came! The poor people
   who had all sorts of dire complaints, even those who had devils in
   them, came just as they were! That is the point to which I would bring
   every man here who has not come to Christ--you are to come just as you
   are!

   Are you a drunk? You have to give up the drink, but you must come to
   Him as you are to help you to give it up! Have you lived in uncleanness
   of life? Come and trust in Christ, unclean as you are--trust Him to
   make you pure! Have you been dishonest? Come to Him as dishonest, that
   He may make you honest! Do not attempt to make yourself fit for
   salvation, for it is clear that no one is so fit for saving as the
   lost--no one so fit for washing as the foul, no one so fit for healing
   as the sick! Come to the Savior! Come just as you are. Catch the spirit
   of the hymn--

   "Come needy and guilty,

   Come loathsome and bare!

   You can't come too filthy--

   Come just as you are."

   If you think that it is necessary to begin the work yourself, what is
   that but to insinuate that the Lord Jesus cannot do anything till you
   have started the work? Would you have it to be supposed that He is not
   quite up to the mark and needs help from you? Is He so poor a Savior
   that He is nothing till you enable Him to work? Think not so, but come
   along! You have heard what great things He has done--come, then, to Him
   even now--that the same great things may be worked in you!

   III. I will not say much upon the third point which is THE RESULT. Of
   all that came to our Lord, multitudes though they were, not one was
   ever repulsed--no, not one! Since the world began has one soul been
   driven away from the Savior's door? Oh, tell it in Gath! Publish it in
   the streets of Askelon if ever Christ shall be found casting out a
   sinner, for then may the adversary justly rejoice over the defeat of
   the Gospel! Let it ring down the corridors of Hell and let every devil
   dance for joy as he hears that Christ has broken His promise and is
   untrue to His character whenever you hear of one who comes to Him whom
   He casts out! I challenge all time! I challenge Heaven and earth and
   Hell to bring a case in which my Lord and Master ever cast out a soul
   that put its trust in Him. It cannot be!

   As none were repulsed, so all were healed! And even so all who now
   believe in Christ are healed of sin and its plagues! "Ah," say
   objectors, "you preach faith as the way of salvation." We confess the
   charge and glory in it, since it is most true that it does save men.
   "But you ought to bid people do good works in order to salvation." See
   here, good Sir, if the people who believe in Jesus do not perform good
   works and if this faith does not make them moral, honest, sober, holy
   people, then we grant your point! But who shall assert that the
   doctrine of faith is other than purifying and sanctifying when we can
   bring multitudes of proofs that this very preaching up of faith and not
   of works is the most effective cause of virtue and holiness?

   Those who cry "Works, works, works," have generally but a scant supply
   of such wares! Remember the age of Laud and his popish preaching? Who
   were the followers of that theology but the libidinous cavaliers? Those
   who preached salvation by Grace--who were they but the godliest men in
   the nation, the Puritans, against whom no man could bring any charge
   except that they were too sternly good and kept the Sabbath too
   precisely and walked before God with too much gravity? I wish the same
   fault could be found with us all! If that is vile, we propose to be
   viler still--

   "Talk we of morals, oh, You bleeding Lamb! The grand morality is love
   of You." How can this Divine morality of love be worked in us unless
   the Lord Jesus, by His Holy Spirit, bestows upon us a heart to trust
   Him and to take Him and Him, alone, to be our salvation?

   One thing I cannot help mentioning and that is, as everyone that came
   to Christ was healed, it followed that the attraction grew. Say there
   had been 500 healed--then when the people came and a hundred more were
   benefited there were 600 to draw. And the next day, if there were a
   hundred more healed, there were 700 to attract others! Now, there never
   was a time since the world began when there were so many reasons for a
   sinner's coming to Christ as there are this morning! Just think of it.
   Every soul whom the Lord has saved is another argument that He is able
   to save you! In reasoning

   philosophically, if we find a fact, we put it down. But we do not dare
   to draw any inference from it because an isolated fact cannot prove a
   general rule. When we get two or three dozen facts, we say, "The common
   inference from all these is such-and-such," and a rule is proven.

   Suppose we could collect two or three hundreds of such facts, then we
   are really sure! Now, for 1,800 years and more our Lord Jesus Christ
   has gone on saving sinners! And He has saved more sinners at this
   moment than ever before. Still they are coming! Still they are coming
   and still He is saving them and every one of these is an arguments that
   you should come! O my dear Hearer, where are you--the man whom God
   means to bless under this sermon? Come at once and say, "I, too, will
   trust Him with my soul, for He has power to save me." Then shall
   another be added to the long roll of His wonderful cures! The Lord
   grant it may be so and His shall be the praise!

   I desire now to spend a few minutes in real, hard, earnest work, in
   which may God the Holy Spirit help me while I plead with those who have
   never come to Jesus, that they should come to Him at once. My dear
   Hearer, if you have often heard about what Christ has done and yet have
   never come to Him, yourself, that He might work a similar work of love
   in you, I pray you not be hindered any longer. First, come because His
   very name invites you--Jesus, a Savior! You are sinful, but He has
   forgiveness. Come to Him! You will be well met--a sinner and a Savior!
   Can two more congruous things come together?

   His name is Christ, too--that is, Anointed. Now, God has anointed Him
   with power to save and commissioned Him to save and He must and will
   discharge His high office by saving those who come to Him. It is His
   business to save and you may be sure that He wears no empty title and
   makes no vain pretense of being what He is not. Come along, then! Come
   along to Him who is a real Savior for real sinners. He is a Savior
   commissioned of God--commit your soul's business to His care. I say the
   name He bears rings out like a silver bell and this is its note, "Come
   and welcome! Come and welcome to Jesus Christ!" Our Lord's power should
   also encourage you to come to Him. Of that I have already spoken.
   Nothing has ever baffled Him yet. Stormy winds and raging waves obey
   Him! The very devils flee before Him. Come along with you. He is mighty
   to save. Therefore come and hang the whole weight of your souls upon
   Him.

   Next, let His Character allure you. There was never such a mass of love
   as Jesus is! He speaks no harsh words to coming sinners--He gives them
   mercy liberally and upbraids not. Has He not said, "I will receive them
   graciously and love them freely"? Oh, come to Jesus! I am not calling
   you to Moses with the broken fragments of the Law at His feet
   thundering in indignation! I invite you to Jesus with His pierced hands
   and open side entreating souls to come to Him. Come to Jesus because
   God has made it His Glory to pardon sinners! Constantine had a son whom
   he much loved and he wished the nation to honor him and so while his
   son was yet a child he caused him to sign pardons and charters, so that
   all gracious acts of the king bore the prince's signature. The Prince
   Emmanuel signs and seals Divine pardons for the chief of sinners! And
   the great God in Heaven loves that His Son should give pardon to
   sinners, for it endears Him to men and brings Him honor. Since it will
   honor Him to save you, come to Him and be not afraid.

   Again, let me remind you of the preparations that are made for saving
   sinners. Christ has died to save them! He shed His blood to save them
   and do you think He will have these preparations wasted? I smiled last
   night at a little incident in my own home. Three of our friends had
   been writing hard for me all day and my wife, expecting them to tea,
   had spread the table bountifully and adorned it with choice flowers. I
   came into the room and said, "They cannot stop to tea, for there is a
   meeting at the Orphanage and they say they must hurry off." I confess I
   felt sorry as I looked at the table and all its adornments. My own good
   wife replied, "No, no. They cannot go. They must have their tea. I
   cannot spread a table like this and nobody come and eat. Go out and
   fetch in those highwaymen who want to run off! Compel them to come in."
   I fetched them in and they were by no means loath to sit down and
   partake!

   It would have been a great disappointment to the kind hostess if no one
   had eaten what she had provided. This is a homely story, but it sets
   forth the need there is that our Lord's provisions of Grace should be
   used. He has spread a table and He will have sinners come and feed at
   it. What did the king say who made a wedding feast for his son? "Go out
   quickly into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in." Thus
   the wedding was furnished with guests. Strange guests they were and yet
   they furnished the feast with guests! They were odd bits of furniture,
   but they were necessary! A wedding with a feast and nobody to eat it
   would be a dishonor to the king, so guests were necessary furniture. Oh
   you that are furthest off from God, my Master's mercy needs your misery
   that He may relieve it! He needs your emptiness that He may impart His
   fullness and Grace for Grace!

   One thing more I have to say. I cannot tell if it will have power with
   anybody present, but I hope it may. I wish you would come to Jesus even
   for His servant's sake. If I were a sculptor fashioning a statue I
   should feel that every stroke I took made a permanent impression, so
   that if I only worked a little upon the hard stone I should make some
   progress and my work would remain. Alas, my labor is not thus abiding
   in reference to some of you. I do my best each Sunday, but I am not
   much the gainer, for you seem to be statues of ice and the six weekdays
   melt away my one day's work! It is weary work to labor thus in vain! A
   painter takes his brush and though he may be executing a very difficult
   portrait, yet every stroke and each tint and touch of color denotes
   progress.

   Alas, I seem as if I wrote on the sand with some of you! The week's
   tide obliterates the Sabbath's marks! Am I always to weave in the
   pulpit that which is undone at home? You do not know how sadly we
   sometimes say to our Master, "Who has believed our report and to whom
   is the arm of the Lord revealed?" We would give anything to see our
   hearers converted, that our Master might have honor and we are sad when
   men come not at our call! If we see no souls brought to the Redeemer's
   feet, we are ready to lie down and die.

   I read the other day of an old minister who had been some 20 years
   without a conversion, as far as he knew and yet he was a really earnest
   man. At last, having much prayed over it, he announced that he should
   preach no more in that place, but resign his charge and the reason he
   gave them with many tears was, "I am doing no good among you. There are
   no souls saved and perhaps if another minister filled my place you
   might listen to his appeals. At any rate, I will not stand in the way
   of one who might be more useful and so I bid you farewell." As he went
   out an old woman named Sarah said, "O, Sir, you cannot go, for you were
   the means of leading me to Christ some three or four years ago." "You,"
   he said, "Sarah, I thought you were one who did not care for my
   ministry." "Oh, Sir," she said, "it has been my meat and my drink."
   "Woman," he said, "why did you not tell me as much before? My heart has
   been breaking for you." In the course of the week 20 or 30 came in to
   testify that they had sought and found the Savior through his ministry.
   All he could do was to say, "Bless the Lord, I'll not leave my post.
   But why did you not tell me of it before? O the sleepless nights I
   might have missed if you had but told me."

   Some of you may have been saved and yet you have never confessed the
   blessed fact! I ask you, whether you do well and kindly by His servant
   thus to rob him of his wages and keep back comforting news from his
   burdened heart! However, that may pass. You who have not sought and
   have not found my Lord--what message shall I take home, this morning,
   to my Master when I go upstairs to speak with Him alone? Shall I tell
   Him you will not believe on Him? I set Him before you once again as
   able to save you--will you again refuse Him? Or shall the message be
   that you will trust in Him for salvation? God grant that you may give a
   wise reply for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.

Following the Risen Christ

   (No. 1530)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MARCH 28, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "If you then are risen with Christ, seek those things which are above,
   where Christ sits at the right hand of God. Set your affection on
   things abo ve, not on things on the earth." Colossians 3:1,2.

   THE resurrection of our Divine Lord from the dead is the cornerstone of
   Christian doctrine. Perhaps I might more accurately call it the
   keystone of the arch of Christianity, for if that fact could be
   disproved, the whole fabric of the Gospel would fall to the ground. If
   Jesus Christ is not risen, then is our preaching in vain and your faith
   is also in vain--you are yet in your sins. If Christ is not risen, then
   they which have fallen asleep in Christ have perished and we,
   ourselves, in missing so glorious a hope as that of Resurrection, are,
   of all men, the most miserable! Because of the great importance of His
   Resurrection, our Lord was pleased to give many Infallible proofs of
   it, by appearing again and again in the midst of His followers.

   It would be interesting to search out how many times He appeared. I
   think we have mention of some 16 manifestations. He showed Himself
   openly before His disciples and did eat and drink with them. They
   touched His hands and His side and heard His voice and knew that it was
   the same Jesus that was crucified. He was not content with giving
   evidence to the ears and to the eyes, but even to the sense of touch He
   proved the reality of His Resurrection. These appearances were very
   varied. Sometimes He gave an interview to one alone, either to a man,
   as to Cephas, or to a woman, as to Magdalene. He conversed with two of
   His followers as they went to Emmaus and with the company of the
   Apostles by the sea. We find Him at one moment among the 11 when the
   doors were shut for fear of the Jews and at another time in the midst
   of an assembly of more than 500 brethren, who, years later, were, most
   of them, living witnesses to the fact.

   They could not all have been deceived. It is not possible that any
   historical fact could have been placed upon a better basis of
   credibility than the Resurrection of our Lord from the dead. This is
   put beyond all dispute and question and it was done on purpose because
   it is essential to the whole Christian system. For this same cause the
   Resurrection of Christ is commemorated frequently. There is no
   ordinance in Scripture of any one Lord's-Day in the year being set
   apart to commemorate the rising of Christ from the dead and for this
   reason every Lord's-Day is the memorial of our Lord's Resurrection.
   Wake up any Lord's-Day you please, whether in the depth of winter, or
   in the warmth of summer and you may

   sing--

   "Today He rose and left the dead,

   And Satan's empire fell!

   Today the saints His triumph spread, And all His wonders tell."

   To set apart an Easter Sunday for special memory of the Resurrection is
   a human device for which there is no Scriptural command. But to make
   every Lord's-Day an Easter Sunday is due to Him who rose early on the
   first day of the week. We gather together on the first, rather than
   upon the seventh day of the week, because redemption is even a greater
   work than creation and more worthy of commemoration and because the
   rest which followed creation is far outdone by that which ensues upon
   the completion of redemption! Like the Apostles, we meet on the first
   day of the week and hope that Jesus may stand in our midst and say,
   "Peace be unto you."

   Our Lord has lifted the Sabbath from the old and rusted hinges whereon
   the Law had placed it long before and set it on the new golden hinges
   which His love has fashioned. He has placed our rest day, not at the
   end of a week of toil, but at the beginning of the rest which remains
   for the people of God. Every first day of the week we should meditate
   upon the

   rising of our Lord and seek to enter into fellowship with Him in His
   risen life. Never let us forget that all who are in Him rose from the
   dead in His rising.

   Next in importance to the fact of the Resurrection is the doctrine of
   the federal headship of Christ and the unity of all His people with
   Him. It is because we are in Christ that we become partakers of
   everything that Christ did--we are circumcised with Him, dead with Him,
   buried with Him, risen with Him because we cannot be separated from
   Him. We are members of His body and not a bone of Him can be broken.
   Because that union is most intimate, continuous and indissoluble,
   therefore all that concerns Him concerns us and as He rose, so all His
   people have arisen in Him! They are risen in two ways. First,
   representatively. All the elect rose in Christ in the day when He quit
   the tomb. He was justified, or declared to be clear of all liabilities
   on account of our sins by being set free from the prison of the tomb.

   There was no reason for detaining Him in the sepulcher, for He had
   discharged the debts of His people by dying "unto sin once." He was our
   Hostage and our Representative and when He came forth from His bonds we
   came forth in Him. We have endured the sentence of the Law in our
   Substitute. We have lain in its prison and even died under its death
   warrant and now we are no longer under its curse. "Now if we are dead
   with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him: knowing that
   Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more; death has no more
   dominion over Him. For in that He died, He died unto sin once: but in
   that He lives, He lives unto God."

   Next to this representative resurrection comes our spiritual
   resurrection, which is ours as soon as we are led by faith to believe
   in Jesus Christ. Then it my be said of us, "And you has He quickened
   who were dead in trespasses and sins." The resurrection blessing is to
   be perfected, by-and-by, at the appearing of our Lord and Savior, for
   then our bodies shall rise again if we fall asleep before His coming.
   He redeemed our manhood in its entirety--spirit, soul and body-- and He
   will not be content until the resurrection which has passed upon our
   spirit shall pass upon our body, too. These dry bones shall live!
   Together with our dead body they shall rise--

   "When He arose ascending high, He showed our feet the way; Up to the
   Lord our flesh shall fly At the great rising day."

   Then shall we know in the perfection of our resurrection beauty that we
   are, indeed, completely risen in Christ and "as in Adam all die, so in
   Christ shall all be made alive."

   This morning we shall only speak of our fellowship with Christ in His
   Resurrection as to our own spiritual resurrection. Do not misunderstand
   me as if I thought the resurrection to be only spiritual, for a literal
   rising from the dead is yet to come. But our text speaks of spiritual
   resurrection and I shall, therefore, endeavor to set it before you. '
   I. First, then, LET US CONSIDER OUR SPIRITUAL RISING WITH Christ--"If
   you then are risen with Christ." Though the words look like a
   supposition they are not meant to be. The Apostle casts no doubt and
   raises no question, but merely puts it thus for argument's sake. It
   might just as well be read, "Since you then are risen in Christ." The
   "if is used logically, not theologically--by way of argument and not by
   way of doubt. All who believe in Christ are risen with Christ. Let us
   meditate on this Truth of God. For, first, we were "dead in trespasses
   and sins," but having believed in Christ we have been quickened by the
   Holy Spirit and we are dead no longer!

   There we lay in the tomb, ready to become corrupt--yes, some of us were
   corrupt--the marks of the worm of sin were upon our character and the
   foul stench of actual sin arose from us. More or less, according to the
   length of time in which we abode in that death and according to the
   circumstances with which we were surrounded, death worked in us
   corruption. We lay in our death quite unable to raise ourselves. Ours
   were eyes that could not see and ears that could not hear; a heart that
   could not love and withered hands that could not be stretched out to
   give the touch of faith. We were even as they that go down into the
   Pit, as those that have been long dead--only we were in a worse plight
   than those actually dead, for we were responsible for all our omissions
   and inabilities.

   We were as guilty as if we had power, for the loss of moral power is
   not the loss of moral responsibility! We were, therefore, in a state of
   spiritual death of the most fearful kind. The Holy Spirit visited us
   and made us live. We remember the first sensation of life, some of
   us--how it seemed to tingle in our soul's veins with sharp and bitter
   pain--just as drowning persons, when life is coming back to them,
   suffer great pain. Conviction was worked in us and confession of sin. A
   dread of judgment to come and a sense of present condemnation were
   present, but these were tokens of life and that life gradually deepened
   and opened up until the eyes were opened--we could see Christ! Our
   hands ceased to be withered

   and we stretched them out and touched His garment's hem. Our feet began
   to move in the way of obedience and our heart felt the sweet glow of
   love within.

   Then the eyes, not content with only seeing, fell to weeping and
   afterwards, when the tears were wiped away, they flashed and sparkled
   with delight. And oh, my Brothers and Sisters, believers in Jesus, you
   were not spiritually dead any longer! On Christ you have believed and
   that grand act proves that you are dead no more! You have been
   quickened by God according to the working of His mighty power which He
   worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and set Him at His
   own right hand in the heavenlies. Now, Beloved, you are new
   creatures--the product of a second birth, begotten again in Christ
   Jesus unto newness of life! Christ is your life--such a life as you
   never knew before, nor could have known apart from Him. If you then are
   risen with Christ you walk in newness of life while the world abides in
   death!

   Let us advance another step. We are risen with Christ and, therefore,
   there has been worked in us a wonderful change. When the dead shall
   rise, they will not appear as they now are. The buried seed rises from
   the ground, but not as a seed, for it puts forth green leaves and bud
   and stem and gradually develops expanding flowers and fruit and even so
   we wear a new form, for we are renewed after the image of Him that
   created us in righteousness and holiness! I ask you to consider the
   change which the Spirit of God has worked in the Believer--a wonderful
   change, indeed! Before regeneration our soul was as our body will be
   when it dies and we read that, "it is sown in corruption." There was
   corruption in our mind and it was working irresistibly towards every
   evil and offensive thing.

   In many, the corruption did not appear upon the surface, but it worked
   within. In others it was conspicuous and fearful to look upon. How
   great the change! For now the power of corruption within us is broken!
   The new life has overcome it, for it is a living and incorruptible seed
   which lives and abides forever. Corruption is upon the old nature, but
   it cannot touch the new, which is our true and real self. Is it not a
   great thing to be purged of the filthiness which would have ultimately
   brought us down to Hell where the unquenchable fire burns and the
   undying worm feeds upon the corrupt?

   Our old state was further like that which comes upon the body at death
   because it was a state of dishonor. You know how the Apostle says of
   the body, "It is sown in dishonor" and certainly no corpse wears such
   dishonor as that which rests upon a man who is dead in trespasses and
   sins. Why, of all things in the world that deserve shame and contempt,
   a sinful man is certainly the most so! He despises his Creator; he
   neglects his Savior; he chooses evil instead of good and puts the Light
   of God from him because his deeds are evil and, therefore, he prefers
   the darkness. In the judgment of all pure spirits, a sinful man is a
   dishonorable man.

   But oh how changed is man when the Grace of God works within him, for
   then he is honorable. "Behold, what manner of love the Father has
   bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God." What an
   honor this is! Heaven itself contains not a more honorable being than a
   renewed man! Well may we cry with David, "What is man, that You are
   mindful of him? And the son of man, that You visit him?" But when we
   see man, in the Person of Jesus, made to have dominion over all the
   works of God's hands and know that Jesus has made us kings and priests
   unto God, we are filled with amazement that God should so exalt us! The
   Lord Himself has said, " Since you were precious in My sight, you have
   been honorable and I have loved you." "Unto you therefore which believe
   he is an honor," for so the original text may run. A precious Christ
   makes us precious--such honor have all the saints!

   When a body is buried, we are told by the Apostle, again, that it is
   "sown in weakness." The poor dead frame cannot lay itself down in its
   last bed--friendly hands must place it there. Even so we were utter
   weakness towards all good. When we were the captives of sin, we could
   do nothing good, even as our Lord said, "Without Me you can do
   nothing." We were incapable of even a good thought apart from Him. But
   "when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the
   ungodly" and now we know Him and the power of His Resurrection! God has
   given us the spirit of power and of love. Is it not written, "As many
   as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even
   to them that believe on His name"? What an amazing power is this! Now
   we "taste of the powers of the world to come" and we are "strengthened
   with all might, according to His glorious power, unto all patience and
   longsuffering with joyfulness."

   Faith girds us with a Divine power, for, "all things are possible to
   him that believes," and each Believer can exclaim, without boasting, "I
   can do all things through Christ which strengthens me!" Is not this a
   marvelous change which the spiritual resurrection has worked upon us?
   Is it not a glorious thing that God's strength should be perfect in our
   weakness? The great change mainly concerns another point. It is said of
   the body, "It is sown a natural body, it is raised a

   spiritual body." Before this we were natural men and discerned not the
   things that are of the Spirit of God. We minded earthly things and were
   moved by carnal lusts after the things which are seen. But now, through
   Divine Grace, a spirit has been created in us which feeds on spiritual
   bread, lives for spiritual objects, is swayed by spiritual motives and
   rejoices in spiritual truths.

   This change, from the natural to the spiritual, is such as only God
   Himself could have worked and yet we have experienced it. To God be the
   glory! So that by virtue of our rising in Christ we have received life
   and have become the subjects of a wondrous change--"old things are
   passed away; behold, all things are become new." In consequence of our
   receiving this life and undergoing this change, the things of the world
   and sin become a tomb to us. To a dead man a sep-ulcher is as good a
   dwelling as he can want. You may call it his bedchamber if you will,
   for he lies within it as unconscious as if he were sleeping. But the
   moment the dead man lives, he will not endure such a bedchamber! He
   calls it a dreary vault; a loathsome dungeon; an unbearable morgue and
   he must leave it at once!

   So when you and I were natural men and had no spiritual life, the
   things of this life contented us. But it is far otherwise now. A merely
   outward religion was all that we desired--a dead form suited a dead
   soul. Judaism pleased those who were under its yoke in the very
   beginning of the Gospel. New moons and holy days and traditional
   ordinances and fasting and feasting were great things with those who
   forgot their resurrection with Christ! All those things make pretty
   furniture for a dead man's chamber! But when the Eternal Life enters
   the soul, these outward ordinances are flung off-- the living man tears
   off his grave clothes and demands such garments as are suitable for
   life!

   So the Apostle in the chapter before our text tells us to let no man
   spoil us by the traditions of men and the inventions of a dead
   ritualism, for these things are not the portion of renewed and
   spiritual men. So, too, all merely carnal objects become as a grave to
   us, whether they are sinful pleasures or selfish gains. For the dead
   man, the shroud, the coffin and the vault are suitable enough--but make
   the corpse alive and he cannot rest in the coffin! He makes desperate
   struggles to break it up. See how, by main force, he dashes up the lid,
   tears off his bandages and leaps from the bier! So the man renewed by
   Grace cannot live in sin--it is a coffin to him--he cannot bear evil
   pleasures, they are as a shroud. He cries for liberty!

   When resurrection comes, the man lifts up the soil above his grave and
   scatters monument and headstone, if these are raised above him. Some
   souls are buried under a mass of self-righteousness, like wealthy men
   on whom shrines of marble have been heaped. But all these the Believer
   shakes off! He must have them gone! He cannot bear these dead works. He
   cannot live otherwise than by faith--all other life is death to him. He
   must get out of his former state, for as a tomb is not a fit place for
   a living man, so when we are quickened by Grace, the things of sin and
   self and carnal sense become dreary catacombs to us where our soul
   feels buried and out of which we must arise. How can we that are raised
   out of the death of sin live any longer in sin?

   And, now, Beloved, we are at this time wholly raised from the dead in a
   spiritual sense. Let us think of this, for our Lord did not have His
   head quickened while His feet remained in the sepulcher. He rose a
   perfect and entire Man, alive throughout. Even so have we been renewed
   in every part. We have received, though it is but in its infancy, a
   perfect spiritual life--we are perfect in Christ Jesus. In our inner
   man our eyes are opened, our ears are awakened, our hands are active,
   our feet are nimble--our every faculty is there, though as yet immature
   and needing development and having the old dead nature to contend with.
   Moreover and best of all, we are so raised that we shall die no more!
   Oh, tell me no more the dreary tale that a man who has received the
   Divine Life may yet lose Grace and perish!

   With our Bibles in our hands we know better. "Christ being raised from
   the dead dies no more, death has no more dominion over Him" and,
   therefore, He that has received Christ's life in him shall never die.
   Has He not said, "He that believes in Me, though he were dead yet shall
   he live; and whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die"? This
   life which He has given us shall be in us, "a well of water, springing
   up unto everlasting life." He has said, "I give unto My sheep eternal
   life and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of
   My hand." On the day of our quickening we bid farewell to spiritual
   death and to the sepulcher where we slept under sin's dominion!

   Farewell, you deadly love of sin! We have done with you! Farewell, dead
   world, corrupt world! We have done with you! Christ has raised us.
   Christ has given us eternal life! We forsake forever the dreary abodes
   of death and seek the heavenly places. Our Jesus lives and because He
   lives we shall live also, world without end! Thus I have tried to work
   out the metaphor of resurrection, by which our spiritual renewal is so
   well set forth.

   II. We are urged by the Apostle to use the life which we have received
   and so, secondly, LET US EXERCISE THE NEW LIFE IN SUITABLE PURSUITS.
   "If you then are risen with Christ, seek those things which are above."
   Let your actions be agreeable to your new life. First, then, let us
   leave the sepulcher. If we are quickened, our first act should be to
   leave the region of death. Let us quit the vault of a merely outward
   religion and let us worship God in spirit and in truth. Let us have
   done with priestcraft and all the black business of spiritual
   undertaking and let the dead bury their dead-- we will have none of it!
   Let us have done with outward forms and rites and ceremonies, which are
   not of Christ's ordaining and let us know nothing except Christ
   Crucified, for that which is not of the living Lord is a mere piece of
   funeral pomp, fit for the cemeteries of formalists whose whole religion
   is a shoveling in of dust on coffin lids. "Earth to earth, ashes to
   ashes, dust to dust." "That which is born of the flesh is flesh."

   Let us also quit the vault of carnal enjoyments where men seek to
   satisfy themselves with provision for the flesh. Let us not live by the
   sight of the eyes, nor by the hearing of the ears. Let us not live for
   the amassing of wealth, or the gaining of fame, for these ought to be
   as dead things to the man who is risen in Christ. Let us not live for
   the world which we see, nor after the fashion of men to whom this life
   is everything. Let us live as those that have come out of the world and
   who, though they are in it, are no more of it. Let us be unmindful of
   the country from where we came out and leave it, as Abraham did, as
   though there were no such country, henceforth dwelling with our God,
   sojourners with Him, seeking "a city which has foundations, whose
   builder and maker is God." As Jesus Christ left behind Him all the
   abodes of death, let us do the same.

   And, then, let us hasten to forget every evil, even as our Lord
   hastened to leave the tomb. How little a time, after all, did He
   sojourn among the dead! He must lie in the heart of the earth three
   days, but He made them as short as possible, so that it is difficult to
   make out the three days at all. They were there, for there were
   fragments of each period, but surely never were three days so short as
   Jesus made them! He cut them short in righteousness and being loosed
   from the pains of death, He rose early, at the very break of day! At
   the first instant that it was possible for Him to get away from the
   sepulcher, consistent with the Scriptures, He left the napkin and the
   grave clothes and stood in the garden, waiting to salute His disciples!

   So let it be with us! There should be no lingering, no loitering, no
   hankering after the world--no clinging to its vanities, no making
   provision for the flesh. Up in the morning early, oh you who are
   spiritually quickened! Up in the morning early from your ease, your
   carnal pleasure, your love of wealth and self and away out from the
   dark vault into a congenial sphere of action--"If you then are risen
   with Christ, seek those things which are above."

   To pursue the analogy--when our Lord had left the tomb thus early, He
   spent a season on earth among His disciples and we are to pass the time
   of our sojourning here on earth as His was passed--in holy service. Our
   Lord reckoned that He was on the move from earth as soon as He rose. If
   you remember, He said, "I ascend unto My Father and your Father." He
   did not say, "I shall ascend," as though He looked at it as a future
   event, but He said, "I ascend," as if it were so quickly to be done
   that it was already doing. Forty days He stayed, for He had 40 days'
   work to do--but He looked upon Himself as already going up into Heaven.
   He had done with the world. He had done with the grave and now He said,
   "I ascend to My Father and your Father."

   We also have our 40 days to tarry here--the period may be longer or
   shorter as the Providence of God ordains-- but it will soon be over and
   the time of our departure will come. Let us spend our risen life on
   earth as Jesus spent His-- in a greater seclusion from the world and in
   greater nearness to Heaven than ever. Our Lord occupied Himself much in
   testimony--manifesting Himself--as we have already seen, in many ways
   to His friends and followers. Let us also manifest the fruits of our
   risen life and bear testimony to the power of God! Let all men see that
   we are risen! So live that there can be no more doubt about your
   spiritual resurrection than there was about Christ's literal
   Resurrection. Do not publish to the world your own virtues that you may
   be honored among them. "Let your light so shine before men that they
   may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in Heaven."

   Put your possession of the new life beyond question so that when you
   have gone Home your friends and acquaintances may say--"He was a living
   child of God, for we felt the power of his life. He was a changed man,
   for we saw the renewing." Jesus spent His risen life, also, in
   comforting His saints. He said, "Peace be unto you." He spoke to one
   and another, to poor Peter who denied Him and to all the assembled
   company, cheering them and preparing them for their future career. He
   spent those 40 days in setting everything in order in His kingdom,
   arranging as to what should be when

   He should be taken up and leaving His last commission to His followers
   was that they should "go into all the world and preach the Gospel to
   every creature." Beloved, let us also spend the time of our sojourning
   here in the fear of God, worshipping Him, serving Him, glorifying Him,
   endeavoring to set everything in order for the extension of our
   Master's Kingdom, for the comforting of His saints, for the
   accomplishment of His sacred purposes.

   And now I have led you up so far, I want to go further and rise higher.
   May the Lord help us! Let our minds ascend to Heaven in Christ. Even
   while our bodies are here we are to be drawn upward with
   Christ--attracted to Him so that we can say, "He has raised us up
   together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus."
   Our text says, "Seek those things which are above where Christ sits at
   the right hand of God." What is this but rising to heavenly pursuits?
   Jesus has gone up--let us go up with Him! As for these bodies, we
   cannot as yet ascend, for they are not fit to inherit the Kingdom of
   God--yet let our thoughts and hearts mount up and build a happy rest on
   high! Let not a stray thought ascend like one lone bird which sings and
   mounts the sky, but let our whole mind, soul, spirit, heart arise as
   when doves fly as a cloud!

   Let us be practical, too, and in very deed seek the things that are
   above--seek them because we feel we need them. Seek them because we
   greatly prize them. Seek them because we hope to gain them for a man
   will not heartily seek for that which he has no hope of obtaining. The
   things which are above, which we are even now to seek, are such as
   these-- let us seek heavenly communion, for we are no more numbered
   with the congregation of the dead, but we have fellowship in Christ's
   Resurrection and with all the risen ones. "Truly our fellowship is with
   the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ" and, "our conversation is in
   Heaven." Let us seek to walk with the living God and to know the
   fellowship of the Spirit. Let us seek heavenly Graces, for "every good
   gift and every perfect gift is from above." Let us seek more faith,
   more love, more patience, more zeal--let us labor after greater
   charity, greater brotherly kindness, greater humbleness of spirit.

   Let us labor after likeness to Christ, that He may be the firstborn
   among many brethren. Seek to bear the image of the heavenly and to wear
   those jewels which adorn heavenly spirits. Seek also heavenly
   objectives. Aim at the Glory of God in everything. You have to labor
   and toil in this world for you are yet in the body--take care to use
   worldly things to God's Glory. Exercise your privileges and fulfill
   your duties as men and as Englishmen, as before God, not minding the
   judgment of men. Wherein you mingle with the sons of men, take heed
   that you descend not to their level, nor act from their motives. You
   are not to seek your own selfish ends or the aggrandizement of a party,
   but to promote the general good and the interests of truth,
   righteousness, peace and purity. Sanctify everything by the love of God
   and your neighbor. Seek no party ends, but things which are pure and
   honest and of good report.

   Descend not to the falsehood, the trickery, the policy which are from
   beneath, but honestly, sincerely, righteously, always seek to live as
   those who are alive from the dead. "Seek those things which are above,"
   that is, heavenly joys. Oh seek to know on earth the peace of Heaven,
   the rest of Heaven, the victory of Heaven, the service of Heaven, the
   communion of Heaven, the holiness of Heaven! You may have foretastes of
   all these--seek after them! Seek, in a word, to be preparing for the
   Heaven which Christ is preparing for you. You are soon to dwell
   above--robe yourselves for the great festival. Your treasure is above,
   let your hearts be with it. All that you are to possess in eternity is
   above, where Christ is! Rise, then, and enjoy it! Let hope anticipate
   the joys which are reserved and so let us begin our Heaven here below.

   If you, then, are risen with Christ, live according to your risen
   nature, for your life is hid with Christ in God. What a magnet to draw
   us towards Heaven should this fact be--that Christ sits at God's right
   hand! Where should the wife's thoughts be when her husband is away but
   with the absent and beloved one? You know, Brothers and Sisters, it is
   not otherwise with us--the objects of our affection are always followed
   by our thoughts. Let Jesus, then, be as a great loadstone, drawing our
   meditations and affections towards Himself. He is sitting, for His work
   is done, as it is written, "This Man, when He had offered one sacrifice
   for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God." Let us rise and
   rest with Him! He is sitting on a Throne. Observe His majesty! Delight
   in His power and trust in His dominion.

   He is sitting at the right hand of God in the place of honor and favor.
   This is a proof that we are beloved and favored of God, for our
   Representative has the choicest place, at God's right hand! Let your
   hearts ascend and enjoy that love and favor with Him. Take wing, my
   thoughts, and fly away to Jesus! My Soul, have you not often said,
   "Woe's me that I dwell in Meshach and tabernacle in the tents of Kedar!
   Oh that I had wings like a dove, that I might fly away and be at rest"?
   Now, then, my Soul, here are wings for you! Jesus draws you upward! You
   have a right to be where Jesus is, for

   you are married to Him! Therefore let your thoughts abide with Him,
   rest in Him, delight in Him, rejoice in Him and yet again rejoice!

   The sacred ladder is before us, Brothers and Sisters, let us climb it,
   until, by faith, we sit in the heavenlies with Him. May the Spirit of
   God bless these words to you.

   III. Thirdly, inasmuch as we are risen with Christ, LET THE NEW LIFE
   DELIGHT ITSELF IN SUITABLE OBJECTS. This brings in the second
   verse--"Set your affection on things above, not on things on the
   earth." "Set your affection." These words do not quite express the
   meaning, though they are as near it as any one clause could well come.
   We might render it thus--"Have a relish for things above" or, "Study
   industriously things above" or, "Set your mind on things above, not on
   things on the earth." That which is proper enough for a dead man is
   quite unsuitable for a risen one! Objects of desire which might suit us
   when we were sinners are not legitimate nor worthy objects for us when
   we are made saints. As we are quickened, we must exercise life and, as
   we have ascended, we must love higher things than those of earth.

   What are these "things above" which we should set our affection upon? I
   ask you, now, to lift your eyes above yonder clouds and this lower
   firmament to the residence of God. What do you see there? First, there
   is God Himself. Make Him the subject of your thoughts, your desires,
   your emotions, your love. "Delight yourself, also, in the Lord and He
   will give you the desires of your heart." "My Soul, wait only upon God,
   for my expectation is from Him." Call Him, "God my exceeding joy." Let
   nothing come between you and your heavenly Father! What is all the
   world if you have not God and when you once have God, what matters it
   though all the world is gone? God is all things and when you can say,
   "God is mine," you are richer than Croesus. O to say, "Whom have I in
   Heaven but You? And there is none upon earth that I desire beside You"!

   O to love God with all our heart and with all our soul and with all our
   mind and with all our strength--that is what the Law required--but it
   is what the Gospel enables us to render. What do I see next? I see
   Jesus, who is God, but yet is truly Man. Need I press upon you,
   Beloved, to set your love upon the Well-Beloved? Has He not won your
   heart and does He not hold it, now, as under a mighty spell? I know you
   love Him! Fix your mind on Him, then. Often meditate upon His Divine
   Person, His perfect work, His mediatorial Glory, His second coming, His
   glorious reign, His love for you, your own security in Him, your union
   with Him! Oh let these sweet thoughts possess your breasts, fill your
   mouths and influence your lives. Let the morning break with thoughts of
   Christ and let your last thought at night be sweetened with His
   Presence. Set your affection upon Him who has set His affection upon
   you!

   But what do I see above next? I see the new Jerusalem which is the
   mother of us all! I see the Church of Christ triumphant in Heaven, with
   which the Church militant is one. We do not realize enough the fact
   that we are come unto the general assembly and Church of the Firstborn,
   whose names are written in Heaven. Love all the saints, but do not
   forget the saints above! Have fellowship with them, for we make but one
   communion. Remember those--

   "Who once were mourning here below,

   And wet their couch with tears,

   Who wrestled hard, as we do now,

   With sins and doubts and fears."

   Speak with the brave ones who have won their crowns, the heroes who
   have fought a good fight and now rest from their labors, waving the
   palm. Let your hearts be often among the perfected, with whom you are
   to spend eternity.

   And what else is there above that our hearts should love but Heaven
   itself? It is the place of holiness! Let us so love it that we begin to
   be holy here. It is the place of rest--let us so delight in it that by
   faith we enter into that rest! O my Brothers and Sisters, you have vast
   estates which you have never seen--and I think if I had an estate on
   earth which was soon to be mine, I would wish to take a peep over the
   hedge now and then. If I could not take possession, I should like to
   see what I had in reversion. I would make an excuse to pass that way
   and say to any who were with me, "That estate is going to be mine
   before long."

   In your present poverty console yourselves with the many mansions. In
   your sickness delight much in the land where the inhabitants shall no
   more say, "I am sick." In the midst of depression of spirit comfort
   your heart with the prospect of unmixed felicity--

   "No more fatigue, no more distress, Nor sin nor death shall reach the
   place!

   No groans to mingle with the songs

   Which warble from immortal tongues!" What? Are you fettered to earth?
   Can you not project yourself into the future? The stream of death is
   narrow--cannot your imagination and your faith leap over the brook to
   stand on the other shore awhile and cry, "All is mine and mine forever!
   Where Jesus is there shall I be! Where Jesus sits there shall I rest--

   'Far from a world of grief and sin,

   With God eternally shut in'"? "Set your affection on things above."

   Oh to get away at this present time from these dull cares which, like a
   fog, envelope us! Even we that are Christ's servants and live in His
   court, at times, feel weary and droop as if His service were hard. He
   never means it to be a bondage and it is our fault if we make it so.
   Martha's service is due, but she is not called to be cumbered with much
   serving--that is her own arrangement! Let us serve abundantly and yet
   sit with Mary at the Master's feet. You who are in business and mix
   with the world by the necessity of your callings must find it difficult
   to keep quite clear of the dragging down influences of this poor
   world--it will hamper you if it can. You are like a bird which is
   always in danger when it alights on the earth. There are twigs and
   traps and nets and guns and a poor bird is never safe except upon the
   wing and up aloft. Yet birds must come down to feed and they do well to
   gather their meal in haste and take to their wings again.

   When we come down among men we must speedily be up again. When you have
   to mix with the world and see its sin and evil, yet take heed that you
   do not light on the ground without your Father. And then, as soon as
   ever you have picked up your barley, rise again--away, away, for this
   is not your rest! You are like Noah's dove flying over the waste of
   waters--there is no rest for the sole of your feet but on the ark with
   Jesus! On this Resurrection Day fence out the world! Let us chase away
   the wild boar of the woods and let the vines bloom and the tender
   grapes give forth their good smell and let the Beloved come and walk in
   the garden of our souls while we delight ourselves in Him and in His
   heavenly

   gifts.

   Let us not carry our burden of things below on this holy day, but let
   us keep it as a Sabbath unto the Lord! On the Sabbath we are no more to
   work with our minds than with our hands. Cares and anxieties of an
   earthly kind defile the day of sacred rest. The essence of
   Sabbath-breaking lies in worry and murmuring and unbelief with which
   too many are filled. Put these away, Beloved, for we are risen with
   Christ and it is not right that we should wander among the tombs! No,
   rather let us sing unto the Lord a new song and praise Him with our
   whole soul.

On Whose Side Are You?

   (No. 1531)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 4, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said, Who is on the
   Lord's side? Let him come unto me." Exodus 32:26.

   DURING the last few days in which the stir of a general election has
   moved the most quiet of our streets, every one of you must have been
   asked, many times, on which side you are. Some are enthusiastic on this
   side and some are quite as warm on the other and the interest of all
   ranks and classes is awakened. Now that the Lord's Day has come I hope
   you will forget all about politics and listen to me while I ask a far
   more important question, namely, "Who is on the Lord's side?" May God
   grant us Grace to give an honest answer and may that answer be, "Yes,
   Lord, You know all things, You know that I love You."

   May thousands of you say to the Lord what Amaziah and his band said to
   David, "Yours are we, David, and on your side, son of Jesse." Before I
   enlarge upon this exceedingly personal and practical question, I must
   ask you to remember the man who asked it. It was Moses who put this
   question, "Who is on the Lord's side?" and he put it to Israel when sin
   was rampant in the camp. It is well to remember that he stood there as
   a lone man, the solitary champion of Jehovah and challenged the whole
   nation to decide for God! His own brother had practically deserted him
   and become the means of making the golden calf. The 70 elders who ought
   to have been by his side were, none of them, present with him except
   his lieutenant Joshua.

   He stood alone in the midst of the multitude just when they were
   intoxicated with their lustful pleasures and their fanatical worship.
   He was equal to the emergency! Thoughtless altogether of his own
   safety, dauntless, brave and bold, he dashes down their idol and
   commands it to be ground small and cast into the water of which the
   nation would drink. He upbraids them to their faces and strides among
   them, as much superior to them all as a shepherd is superior to the
   flock he tends. You have to admire his courage! You wonder at his
   supreme power and you inquire for the secret of such sovereign
   strength. Moses must have worn about him a dignity most commanding, a
   royalty far superior to that which comes of birth or office!

   Don't you know where he derived that majesty? He had been, for 40 days,
   alone with God! Heavenly communion makes a man strong. He had been in
   the secret place of the Most High. He had spoken with God, face to
   face, as a man speaks with his friend, and it was not likely that he
   should fear the face of man after having seen the face of God! He had
   been familiar with the sublime and when he came down to the infinite
   littleness of men who had dared to liken the Glory of God to the image
   of an ox that eats grass, he wore about him a natural superiority
   before which they all trembled and slunk away in fear!

   Moses was also a man of prayer. He had stopped the hand of the Almighty
   on the mountain's brow till even God, Himself, had said, "Let Me
   alone"--wondrous though it may seem, the man, Moses, by his holy faith
   had even put a restraint on God Himself! Be you sure of this, that the
   man who has power with God will have power with men. If we have power
   with God for men, we shall have power with men for God! He that can
   overcome Heaven by prayer--what is there that he cannot conquer? There
   stood Moses, like a lone rock in the midst of the tempestuous sea! The
   tumult of the people raged around him, but he was firm and unmoved. He
   became, indeed, the one fixed point upon which the very existence of
   true religion depended. All the partisans of godliness remaining in the
   camp, hidden and concealed, rallied to his call and the one man saved
   the cause.

   So has it been in history, not once nor twice, but many a time! A
   single determined man, full of God's Spirit, has confronted the whole
   mass of the people--has breasted the rushing torrent of popular
   prejudice and has not only stemmed the current, but turned it in the
   opposite direction even as Moses did! Being girt with the power of God
   and

   having learned to dwell on high, the one Believer has become the heroic
   leader of a band of earnest hearts. Brothers and Sisters, we need, in
   these days, men and women of fixed principles! We need individuals of
   enlightened mind and determined will! We need those who know what is
   right and will not deviate from it even though they should risk their
   lives! We need to have, not one or two, but multitudes of steadfast men
   and women, who, when they put their foot down, mean to abide there and
   cannot be pushed from off their standing-place.

   If any of you aspire to lead your own families and to influence your
   own connections in the right way, you must possess personal strength of
   mind of the right sort and you must get it where Moses gained his
   power. You must be much alone with God and mighty on your knees. Come
   forth to face the wicked world with your faces radiant with the light
   of God! Communion with Heaven must win for you Divine help, that you
   may not be overcome by evil, but may overcome evil with good. Thus much
   concerning Moses. God make us to be like he.

   Let us now consider Moses' question and command--"Who is on the Lord's
   side? Let him come unto me." I think I see here three very important
   points. The first is decision--a man must be on the Lord's side.
   Secondly, here is acknowledgment, "Let him come unto me"--if he is on
   the Lord's side, do not let him skulk away in his tent, but let him
   confront the adversary. And, thirdly, here is consecration, for those
   on the Lord's side were to come to Moses that they might do the Lord's
   bidding and fight the Lord's battles at all costs.

   I. First then, here is DECISION, or being on the Lord's side. It is a
   decision upon the most sublime and important theme which can ever come
   under a man's notice. Here are the two camps, God and Satan, truth and
   falsehood, holiness and sin. On which side are we? When I see a man
   pausing, as it were, between the two hosts and saying to himself,
   "Which shall have my heart? Which shall command my service?" I feel
   that he tarries in a position at once hazardous and sublime, for
   whichever that choice shall be, it means eternity--it means Heaven and
   all its glories--or it means Hell with all its terrors.

   Whether the man shall be for God or for God's enemies will mean, for
   that man, kinship with angels, or league with devils! It shall mean for
   him the white robe and the everlasting song of adoring praise, or it
   shall mean the blackness of darkness and the perpetual wailing of
   unending misery. Hence a man is placed in a most solemn position when
   this question is put to him, "Are you on God's side, or are you His
   enemy?" About all other matters, you should go to work with such a
   measure of consideration as they deserve. But to this business you must
   bring your weightiest thought. You must concentrate all your wit and
   wisdom and judge and decide upon this matter with all calmness and
   deliberation--but with all solemnity of resolution and sternness of
   determination, so that, having once made your choice by the directing
   Grace of God--you may stand to that choice world without end.

   Are there any here who have not decided upon this point? As the
   question goes round, "Who is on the Lord's side?" are some of you
   obliged to say, "I have not made up my mind yet"? It is time you did,
   for it is a dreadful thing for a man to be standing there, as I said,
   midway between God and the devil, between Christ and Belial, between
   Heaven and Hell, for, whether he knows it or not, that midway place
   which he thinks he occupies is really on the wrong side! So our Lord
   Jesus judges it--"He that is not with Me is against Me and he that
   gathers not with Me scatters abroad." This decision, dear Friends, so
   important and weighty, should be made as early as possible. It is not a
   matter which we can afford to leave in the balances, hanging in
   suspense.

   Oh that young people would think of this and not waste the best part of
   their lives in stammering between two opinions! When Aerials came to
   the borders of Macedon, he sent the terse message--"As friends or as
   enemies?" The answer was, "We must stop awhile and take advice." His
   reply was, "While you advise, we march." Happy is that young man who
   can say to others, "While you are considering, I have decided! While
   you are hesitating, I have pushed on and given my heart to God! While
   you are temporizing, I have already entered into conflict with sin and
   death and Hell! While you are counting the cost, I have already
   reckoned the reproach of Christ to be greater riches than all the
   treasures of Egypt!"

   Happy is he who first crosses the Rubicon of decision, drawing his
   sword against sin and throwing away the scabbard, that he may never
   make a truce or treaty with the foe. It is a decision that should be
   made at once, O man, for death is near you and eternity begins to dawn!
   Wait not, young man! Wait not, young woman! Every hour renders it more
   likely that you will make a foolish choice. Delay is dangerous, for it
   is breeding in you the disease of trifling. Take heed lest you grow
   into a procrastinator and halt and halt and halt till you become such a
   cripple that you will halt through

   life and never march with the armies of the Lord! Oh that Divine Grace
   would lead each one to decide upon the spot! This is a decision of the
   greatest importance, for it will influence every subsequent decision
   throughout life.

   If God's Grace shall lead me to say, "Yes, write my name down in the
   roll of champions on the Lord's side," then from that day forth every
   other question will be read in the light of that decision. You will
   henceforth give your love to the Truth of God in rags and not to
   falsehood in silk apparel. You will henceforth favor Righteousness when
   she walks in the mire and abhor Injustice when he rides in the high
   places of the earth. If you are on God's side, whatever things are
   pure, honest and of good report will find a friend in you. You will
   never be on the side of drunkenness, nor on the side of oppression,
   injustice, or war--for in being on the side of God you are the advocate
   of sobriety, justice and peace.

   The side of God is, in the highest and best sense, the side of mankind.
   We best promote the interests of nations when we advance the cause of
   God. I pray that our piety may be of such a practical kind that we may
   carry it with us into everything that we do. I like not that religion
   which lives in churches and is glorious on a Sunday, like the parish
   official in his fine coat, but falls back into its ordinary shabby wear
   when the service is done. Give me that godliness which finds itself at
   home at the fireside and is in its right place in the counting house
   and the work room. True religion is meant for field and street, for
   polling booth and the market. True religion gives a tincture to
   everything with which the man comes in contact and, find him where you
   will, you see that he is on the Lord's side because he is on the right
   side! The follower of Jesus takes that side which for a season may be
   unpopular, but which is, according to the Law and to the Testimony,
   right in the sight of God. Take care, then, how you make your decision
   as to God, since on that pivot your whole character will turn.

   As to this decision there ought to be no possible difficulty. A man
   should decide for God since He is his Creator. Dare you think of being
   opposed to Him that made you and who can crush you as easily as a moth?
   He is our Redeemer, the Lord that bought us with His blood! Is it
   possible that we can be on any other side than His? He is our daily
   Preserver, in whose hands our breath is--can we live in antagonism to
   Him? Our relation to our God ought to be an easy question to decide
   when we remember our obligations. We are not only indebted to God for
   our being, but for every favor which we now enjoy or ever hope to
   possess. Should not a man be on the side of his friend? On the side of
   the best of friends? Think of our responsibilities as they arise out of
   all the blessings which God bestows and there should be an instant
   verdict of the heart for God and for His Christ.

   It should not be difficult to any right-minded man to say, " Yes, I am
   on the side of truth," and because God is Truth, we should be on His
   side. Every right principle demands that we yield ourselves to God. His
   is the just side, the true side, the side which must ultimately
   conquer, the side deliberately adopted and earnestly upheld by all holy
   angels and perfected spirits. Should our decision need much
   considering? Who needs time to debate when the way is plain? And yet it
   is sadly true that, through our sinfulness, an honest, sincere,
   practical decision is not soon arrived at. No, it will never be arrived
   at unless the Holy Spirit shall influence our minds and deliver us from
   the thralldom of our sinful lusts! Oh, that the Spirit of God might
   lead us to choose God's side although it is not the side of self, but
   directly the opposite!

   The most of men are swayed by their own interests--"Which is the be
   side for me? Which will bring me the most wealth, or the most esteem,
   or the most quiet?" But he that is on the side of God scorns such
   selfish considerations and favors not that which is profitable for the
   present, but that which is just and right. Alas, many are influenced by
   the fear of men. What a potent factor is this evil element in directing
   human affairs! Men would do right, but they dare not! They would avoid
   that which is wrong, but then they might be ridiculed for too great
   precision and, therefore, they indulge the side which their conscience
   condemns.

   My Brothers and Sisters, may the Lord give us a different mind from
   this. May the opinion of men have small weight with us. Let us not be
   afraid to make enemies rather than disobey God! I would have you of the
   same mind as the old Spartan who said the question with him never was,
   "How many are my enemies?" but, "where are they?" Yes, that is it,
   "Where are they?" That is all. We are ready for them and do not count
   the odds. If adversaries to the Truth of God and righteousness abound,
   never think of them! Do not calculate their strength, nor estimate what
   an attack upon them may cost you, but at once throw down the gage of
   battle and for God and for righteousness--take the right side.

   One other remark must be made--this decision involves but one
   alternative. If we are not on God's side, we are on the opposite side.
   All through the Word of God there is no preparation made for a third
   party. There is a very numerous body of people who try to inhabit the
   "Betweenities." They will, if they can, go on both sides, or on neither
   side--they

   want to be left alone--they wish to keep themselves to themselves and
   say nothing and do nothing either way. Now, there is no preparation
   made for you, either in this world or in the next! There is no
   synagogue of the undecided on earth and no "purgatory" of middle men in
   the unseen world.

   As to this world, there is no comfort held out to you. You are not
   praised, but you are denounced by the Scriptures and even cursed most
   bitterly for not coming to the help of the Lord against the mighty. You
   are regarded as enemies to God until you are His friends and it must be
   so, for he that is not honest is dishonest! He that is not chaste is
   impure and He that is not for God is necessarily against Him. It is a
   matter about which a soul cannot be colorless, so far from this even
   being possible. This matter is one about which there is usually much
   intensity of feeling one way or another--God has fervent friends and
   bitter foes. All great questions raise in men's minds strong movements
   one way or the other and this greatest of questions is sure to do so.

   Though at present, my Friend, you feel no strong movement in the wrong
   direction, yet that which can produce a great evil movement is lurking
   in your spirit and if it is not slain, by the Grace of God leading you
   to be on God's side, one of these days that slumbering sin of yours may
   awaken itself to an awful display of power. As when a viper, which
   before was numbed by the cold, is warmed into vitality and stings all
   who are near it, so does sin when its hour comes. As the lion cub which
   has not tasted blood is tame as a cat and yet, by-and-by, it assumes
   all the fury of the beast of prey, so is it with the demon of iniquity
   which hides within the human spirit! One way or another you must have
   God and His Christ, or you must be the servants of Satan--holiness must
   hold you or sin will bind you--Heaven must win you and attract you to
   itself--or Hell will mark you for its own and down you will descend!

   There, then, I leave the matter of decision, praying earnestly that all
   who have decided may stand to it and that those who have not decided
   may be led of the Spirit to make up their minds at once.

   II. Secondly, let us consider the ACKNOWLEDGMENT. "Who is on the Lord's
   side? Let him come unto me." The Hebrew is more sharp. It reads like
   this--"Who is on Jehovah's side? To me." It is like the cry of one who
   strikes the first blow in war and, unfurling the standard, summons men
   to enlist. "For God--to me." "If you really are His servants, come and
   gather to me." In this acknowledgment there is, first of all, a coming
   out. They were to come out from among the idolaters. You who are on the
   Lord's side, away in your tents where you have gone that you might not
   join with the riotous crowd--come to me! You that are away there in the
   furtherest limits of the camp who have gone to be quiet from all this
   noise and uproar--come into the gate of the camp to me and show
   yourselves! None must hide their colors this day.

   Now then, I say this morning to you who are on God's side, do not
   conceal your religion! Be not wickedly reticent. Be not ungratefully
   retiring, but come forward. "Come you out from among them! Be you
   separate; touch not the unclean thing." There is too little separation
   from the world, nowadays, among Christian professors. I do not wonder
   at the question a little girl asked of her mother when she had been
   reading the New Testament, "Mother, don't you think it would be very
   nice if we could all move away and go and live where there are
   Christians?" Her mother said, "Why, there are many Christians around
   us." "Oh no, Mother, not like those I have been reading of in the New
   Testament."

   I am afraid the child was right, though there are some New Testament
   Christians even here. I wish there were many more who, in all things,
   followed not the fashions of the world and the follies of the times but
   walked with God in the separated path where Jesus' footsteps are seen.
   This avowal, however, was not only a mere coming out--they were to come
   to the leader. Moses stood there and said, "Let him come unto me." He
   stood there as God's representative and seemed to say, "I am on God's
   side; there is no question about that, though I stand alone--now let
   others who are on God's side come to me."

   "Ah," you say this morning, "We wish we had a leader bold and brave to
   whom we could come." I reply, you have such a leader! Where is He? He
   is gone into the highest heavens, but your faith may see Him! It is the
   Lord Jesus Christ who is first and foremost on God's side! He proved it
   by His life and proved it by His death and this morning He bids all
   that are on God's side to come to Him! Come and let Him be your Master
   and Lord! Come and imitate His example and keep His precepts! Come and
   proclaim His Gospel and defend His Kingdom! He that is on the Lord's
   side let him come to Christ and follow the Lamb wherever He goes!

   And yet there is this much more about it. Those who were to come to
   Moses were, of course, to come to one another. When Moses said, "Who is
   on the Lord's side? Let him come unto me," He was virtually gathering a
   Church and enlist-

   ing an army of men whose hearts God had touched. Such came forth at
   Moses' call. Come, then, you that love the Lord, come and join with
   others who think as you do! Do not birds of a feather flock together?
   If God has made you birds of Paradise, hasten to fly like doves to your
   windows! Friend, if I am on the Lord's side and you are on the Lord's
   side, why should we be strangers to one another? There are few enough
   to stand up for Christ! Surely they ought to be knit together in
   closest affection.

   Unity is strength and as we have no strength to spare, let us be
   united. Come forth you that know the Lord and acknowledge your
   allegiance by joining with others who love your King! Enlist under the
   same Captain and inscribe your names in the same muster roll. I cannot
   give out this call with all the energy I would, or I would publish it
   from every market. I beseech those who are not on the Lord's side not
   to attempt to unite with any visible Church, for that would be rank
   hypocrisy! But I would encourage and invite and entreat and almost go
   the length of commanding those who are on the Lord's side to declare
   themselves! Come you to us, for we, also, are on the Lord's side. Lend
   us your help. Afford us your company. Let us enter into fellowship with
   one another and let us be banded together for everything that is good
   and true because we are on the Lord's side. Attend to this, I pray you
   and make an acknowledgment of your decision for God as speedily as
   possible.

   III. In the third place, with this acknowledgment should come
   CONSECRATION. Those who are on the Lord's side should not merely give
   their names, but give themselves. When we are on the side of Christ we
   belong to Christ. Every man who really is on the Lord's side should
   feel that he is bound to obey God's will. I thank God that I learned
   this lesson when I first knew the Savior. I did not think that in
   matters of religion I was to follow my father, or any other good man.
   It seemed to me that God had put into my hand the Bible and I was to
   read it--I was to find out with diligent searching whatever the Lord
   taught me in that Book and I was to believe and to do as His Word
   taught me.

   I feel it now to be a great comfort to my heart that I took nothing at
   secondhand. I received my doctrine not of men, neither was I taught it,
   but I went directly to the wellhead and drank from the source itself,
   by the teaching of the Spirit of God. I want you all to do this. Do not
   follow a Church--do not follow any great preacher--pin yourself to no
   man's sleeve. To the Law and to the Testimony, if men speak not
   according to this Word of God it is because there is no Light of God in
   them. If everybody would do this, there might still remain diversities
   of judgment, but I am inclined to think that unity in doctrine and in
   practice would be far sooner attained by this habit than by any other
   means.

   If each one would go to the Word for himself and no longer settle down
   in an "ism" learned from somebody else, we would know the Truth of God
   and come together in our views of it. Following in a certain track
   because you happen to be put in it by the circumstances of your birth
   and education is not the way of a candid and enlightened mind! I care
   not for the decrees of Churches, or the dogmas of men. I honor both
   Churches and holy men, but not as dictators to my faith! This one book,
   the Bible, contains the religion of the true Christian, so far as it
   can be described by letters and the Spirit of God has promised to
   enlighten us as to its meaning.

   God grant we may never say, "I do such-and-such because it is in the
   Prayer-Book" or, "Because it is according to our denominational
   standards." What have you to do with any book but the Bible, or with
   any denomination but the Church of Christ, unless it is that the book
   and the denomination are scriptural? See you well to this, for careful
   obedience to God is much needed in these times. I have referred to a
   Spartan once or twice this morning, for something of the Spartan spirit
   would do well if saturated with the spirit of Christ. A Spartan in the
   midst of battle was about to kill his foe. His sword was lifted up as
   the trumpet sounded a retreat and he drew back his weapon. And when one
   asked, "Why did you allow him to escape?" he replied, "I would sooner
   obey my general than kill an enemy."

   For a Christian there is nothing like obedience. "To obey is better
   than sacrifice and to listen, than the fat of rams." Let us learn that.
   When we come to be on the Lord's side we are not only to be willing to
   obey His will, but we are to serve Him actively and energetically.
   Moses said to these men, "Gird every man his sword upon his thigh." You
   are not to enlist on the Lord's side to idle away your time. Hosts of
   people think when they get into the bosom of the Church that they are
   to sleep there like babies in their mothers' arms. The Gospel coach
   goes by and they climb to a box seat if they can, and ride. But the
   idea of ever driving the coach--the idea of working for the
   Master--never enters into their heads. It must not be so with us. We
   must throw our activities and our energies into the side which is
   God's, even as the tribe of Levi fought valorously against the
   rebellious people. And we must do this at all risks and costs.

   These men had a very painful duty to perform. They were made
   executioners of their relatives who were found guilty of high treason
   against God, their King. It cost their hearts much to kill, every man,
   his brother or friend. But if they found them obdurate in their
   idolatry, they were commanded to slay them without mercy and they did
   so. Their hands did not spare, neither did their eyes have pity upon
   any who persisted in rebellion. See what Moses said of them--"Of Levi
   he said, let your Thummim and your Urim be with your Holy One, whom you
   did prove at Massah and with whom you did strive at the waters of
   Meribah. Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen
   him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own
   children: for they have observed Your Word and kept Your Covenant."

   They were thorough with God and so must we be. When you join Christ's
   Church there must be a cutting off of right arms and a plucking out of
   right eyes if necessary. There must be a mortifying of the flesh with
   its affections and lusts. We are called to a battle and we must prepare
   for it and not be afraid. Now, because these men were thus faithful to
   God, they were made the teachers of Israel forever afterwards. Let me
   continue to read to you what Moses says of them, in Deuteronomy 33:10,
   because they had impartially executed the sentence of the Lord. "They
   shall teach Jacob Your judgments and Israel Your Law; they shall put
   incense before You and whole burnt sacrifice upon Your altar."
   Furthermore, they were to be preserved and made more than conquerors
   because of their stern faithfulness.

   They had smitten through the loins of God's enemies and now the prayer
   of the man of God breathes this blessing over them--"Bless, Lord, his
   substance and accept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of
   them that rise against him and of them that hate him, that they rise
   not again." Levi smote God's enemies--God will smite his enemies. Those
   who mind God's work shall find that God works for them. They did their
   duty with stern integrity and, therefore, God makes them leaders of His
   people, teachers of His nation and they shall henceforth triumph over
   all their adversaries. I would have every man who is on the Lord's side
   and who has acknowledged it, follow the Lord's Word in all things, cost
   what it may. You will find, in the Bible, doctrines which the world
   will denounce as harsh--hold them and let them call you cruel if they
   please!

   You will have to publish stern doctrines which will smite the tall
   crest of human pride and thwart the pleasing inclinations of fleshly
   minds--publish them, nevertheless! God will justify you in so doing and
   vindicate you from all aspersions. Allow no reservations. Make no
   provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof. If you are "a
   soldier of the Cross, a follower of the Lamb," it is yours to do what
   God bids you. Yours not to reason why, yours, if necessary, to dare and
   die and still in all holy meekness and gentleness to maintain Truth,
   rough and rugged though it seems to the dainty philosophers of our day.
   Be ever on the side of right! May the Spirit of God help us in all
   this, for unless He helps us, I am sure we shall fail. But if He is
   with us, we shall conquer!

   Those of you who are as yet little in Israel should take care that you
   do your work well for God in your obscure places and then you shall be
   lifted to more prominent positions. These Levites were made teachers
   because they had dared, at God's bidding, to be executioners, a work
   associated in men's minds with dishonor. They were bold enough, though
   but a few, to confront the whole camp and now they shall be made wise
   enough to teach all the tribes. Use well the lowest position and do it
   honor. Aerials the Spartan, when they placed him in a back seat, took
   no umbrage at it, but said, "I will honor the seat if the seat does not
   honor me." So, if you are placed in the lowliest place in Christ's
   house, do honor to it and, by-and-by, when the King comes in to see the
   guests, He will say, "Friend, come up higher."

   If you are faithful over a few things, He will make you ruler over many
   things. Only take heed to it that you fully consecrate yourselves to
   Him on whose side you are. I wish, in conclusion, to show the
   suitability of my subject to this present time. I am sure it is not out
   of season. "Who is on the Lord's side?" let him come to Christ and
   consecrate himself this day to Him. For first, the worship of the
   golden calf is pretty general now. Men are esteemed according to the
   amount of money which they possess. Indeed, we say a man is "worth so
   much." Though the man may not be worth a pair of old shoes, yet if he
   has a big house, a fair estate and a huge capital, he is said to be
   worth so much. Poor little creature! In many cases his worth might be
   written on your thumbnail.

   It is not the man that has worth--his house, his lands and his gold
   have the worth--not the man! There is far too much bowing down and
   cringing before the golden calf in all classes of society. No end of
   dodges are tried to get a scraping of one of the creature's hoofs!
   Brother, you must sooner endure poverty than do a wrong thing for the
   sake of riches and you must learn to value men for what they are, not
   for what they have! It needs not Christianity to tell you that some of
   the worthiest, noblest and most kingly of men earn their bread by the
   sweat of their brow. When you meet them, love

   and honor them. On the other hand, you must know that some of the
   vilest of men have, at times, climbed to high places of wealth and
   power. Do not cringe to any man, but least of all bow to a mere
   moneybag. Value men by their characters and not by their positions. God
   grant that none of us may ever be found worshipping the golden calf!

   Yet to get into society the meanest things are done. I do not know what
   sort of thing society may be, but I have heard that it is a very
   wonderful achievement to get into society--to have the privilege of
   enjoying the empty ceremonies and hollow shams of stupid splendor! To
   have the privilege of talking to those persons who spend more on their
   dress than on their religion. From what little I do know of this
   wonderful thing called, "society," I have felt no ambition to partake
   in its felicities. And yet to get into society I have seen men fling
   away their principles, forsake their friends, stifle their consciences,
   abandon their Church fellowship and become traitors to their God!
   Indeed, they are successful in business and hope to rank among the
   county families and so they leave those who love them to entertain, at
   lavish cost, those who sneer at them! The Lord save those of you who
   are prosperous from being thus degraded.

   The next thing you need to be firm and strong about is the
   superstitions which are too often associated with religious worship.
   Remember, God is to be worshipped and only God. That is the essence of
   the First Commandment. And God is to be worshipped in His own way--that
   is the essence of the Second Commandment. The first is, "You shall have
   no other God," and the second, virtually, is, "You shall not make any
   graven image to represent God, nor bow down to it, nor worship it."
   Moses made the rebellious people drink their god as a punishment. But
   in these times persons live among us who literally eat their god as an
   act of devotion!

   The high spiritual mystery in which we are described as spiritually
   feeding upon our Lord Jesus has my deepest and most solemn reverence,
   but the superstitious opinion that men can and do literally eat the
   flesh of Christ under the form of consecrated bread awakens my
   abhorrence and disgust! The worship of what is called the "Blessed
   Sacrament" is as vile an idolatry as the worship by the Egyptians of
   onions and other pot herbs which grew in their own gardens! There is
   not a pin to choose between the one and the other and yet this is
   getting to be common! Bread, which is nothing but bread and when you
   have said all you can say over it still remains bread, must not be
   produced in a court of law, or if it is so produced, a great bishop,
   who should know better, assures his brethren that he has taken care
   that it is reverently consumed!

   I wonder what became of the moldy bread? Oh, that ever I, an
   Englishman, should be forced to believe that another Englishman in this
   19th century reverences the baker's paste! Great God in Heaven, is this
   the country of Latimer? Is this the land of Gospel Light? Or have we
   clean gone back to Rome and all its idolatries? I want you to be very
   stiff and straight about this! Do not pay religious honor to anything
   which can be seen by the eyes! Worship no symbol, however ancient!
   Worship only God! Abhor every act which approximates to reverence paid
   to pictures, images, crucifixes, pyxes, wafers, chalices, or altars!
   Away with the whole idolatrous business--no epithet of scorn will be
   misapplied if it is turned against these superstitions! I will not now
   quote the words of ridicule which our fathers poured upon this
   wickedness, but I beseech you follow them in sternly refusing by word,
   or look, or sign, to pay the slightest regard for objects of
   superstitious reverence, lest by mingling with the heathen you incur
   their guilt!

   These idolatrous Israelites would have pleaded that they did not
   worship the golden calf but they worshipped Jehovah under the figure of
   a bull--and then they said, "See what a beautiful emblem it is! The
   bull is the image of strength and God is almighty! How instructive it
   is! The ox plows our fields and so produces our harvests--what a
   teaching symbol of the goodness of God! Many of the common people will
   learn more from this than from a sermon." Certain artistic people would
   add, each one in his own manner, "This symbolic worship is so tasteful
   that it helps me to worship. When I was in the camp and there was no
   golden image, I could never enter into such a bare worship, but I
   greatly admire this decorous and hearty service. The extemporary
   prayers of Moses and his brother were too poor for me. That beautiful
   bull is aesthetic and awakens thought and emotion and the ceremonies of
   Apis is to my mind quite a model. Give me a little of
   Israelite-Egyptian, in which you have the old embellished by the new
   and, by the help of music and genuflections I can, indeed, adore." You
   know who they are who talk in this fashion nowadays!

   Afterwards came the popular sports--for it is written of the people
   "they ate and they drank and they rose up to play"--the superstitious
   are usually fond of vain amusements. The Laudean churchman admired The
   Book of Sports. The Book of Sports usually gets upon the same shelf as
   the Book of Ceremonies. "Oh, that is the religion for me," cries one,
   "none of your straight-laced talk about worshipping God in spirit and
   in truth." My Brothers and Sisters, I want

   you to feel that you are on God's side about this, for every symbol, I
   repeat it, whether image, picture, bread, or whatever you please, must
   be denounced if it is set up as an object of worship. Whereas the bread
   and wine are appointed by our Lord Jesus to be used for a memorial of
   Him, they are so to be used with loving thoughtfulness, but we must
   not, we dare not, pay the slightest worship to them, for that were to
   make sin of the blackest dye out of the most tender of all memories.

   The next point is, I would to God we were on the Lord's side in view of
   the sinful amusements which appear to have such charms for many that
   even Christian people go quite as far as they should in reference to
   them. When they had bowed before this golden calf they "rose up to
   play," and very pretty play it was. It does not bear explanation. There
   is about the world a good deal of this "playing." Beware, I pray you,
   of every amusement which prevents your redeeming the time, or tends to
   pollute the mind. There are recreations of a healthy, manly, refreshing
   kind--but those which are of no possible service to you are
   unprofitable. The same spirit which made the Puritan refuse to
   reverence the so-called holy days and holy things of superstition led
   him so to reverence God and His sacred Law that He would not join in
   the debasing amusements of the period, which were, indeed, so gross, as
   a rule, that even irreligious people would not, in these times, endure
   them.

   We have somewhat of the same protest to bear and we must not flinch
   from it. We have better joys than the wanton and the foolish can bring
   to us. We say of a pastime--if this is pure and clean, if this is
   health-giving to the body, or restful and invigorating to the mind--we
   are not led by any old-fashioned whim to denounce it and we do not
   denounce it. But if about it there is a taint of vice or a temptation
   that way, or if it is mere folly, we cannot endure it. We venture not
   where Jesus would not have gone. We would not go where we should be
   afraid to die, or should tremble to hear the trumpet announcing the
   coming of the Lord. This is stern teaching--are you enough on the
   Lord's side to bear it? I pray God to put backbones into modern
   professors! Every other part of their bodies seems to grow firm except
   their spinal column, which remains soft and easily distorted. We need
   to be made resolute and faithful on the Lord's side!

   "Oh," says one, "these are small points." Yes, but I want you to be
   like the Spartan who painted on his shield a fly. "Your escutcheon is
   very small," said one. "True," he said, "but I hold it very close to
   the enemy." If our points of conscience seem to be small, so much the
   more need that we hold them in the very faces of those who think little
   of the things of God! A small point where God is involved is a great
   matter! Trifling with small things leads to trifling with great things!
   Lastly, we need firm decision for God and bold acknowledgment of it in
   this day of general tampering with principle. Numbers of people whom we
   meet say, "You are right, no doubt, but--." Now, the Christian way of
   talking is, "If it is right we know no, 'but'!" "Oh, yes," says one, "I
   agree that it is the straight thing and yet--." A genuine Christian has
   no, "and yets."

   If words plainly mean such-and-such a thing, he uses them in that sense
   and not in an unnatural sense. And he never dares to say, "I know that
   such-and-such things are wrong and they trouble my conscience, but
   still, you see, I am doing a vast amount of good and we must submit to
   a little evil in order to gain a great good." The plain Christian will
   do no evil that good may come--he loathes the Jesuitical notion! He
   believes that it is a great evil to attempt to do good by doing evil.
   To him, truth, right, the teaching of God, the will of Christ are
   supreme objects. Oh, that you all possessed this spirit and were
   steadfast in it! In your family circle; in your
   business--everywhere--be true, be thorough, be upright, be godlike, be
   Christ-like and may the Divine Spirit help you to this, for Jesus
   Christ's sake. Amen.

                         The Holy Spirit's Intercession

   A Sermon

   (No. 1532)

   Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, April 11th, 1880, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what
   we should what pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh
   intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that
   searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he
   maketh intercession for the saints according the to will of God.'Romans
   8:26,27.

   THE APOSTLE PAUL was writing to a tried and afflicted people, and one
   of his objects was to remind them of the rivers of comfort which were
   flowing near at hand. He first of all stirred up their pure minds by
   way of remembrance as to their sonship,'for saith he as many as are led
   by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.' They were, therefore,
   encouraged to take part and lot with Christ, the elder brother, with
   whom they had become joint heirs; and they were exhorted to suffer with
   him, that they might afterwards be glorified with him. All that they
   endured came from a Father's hand, and this should comfort them. A
   thousand sources of joy are opened in that one blessing of adoption.
   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have
   been begotten into the family of grace.

   When Paul had alluded to that consoling subject he turned to the next
   ground of comfort'namely, that we are to be sustained under present
   trial by hope. There is an amazing glory in reserve for us, and though
   as yet we cannot enter upon it, but in harmony with the whole creation
   must continue to groan and travail, yet the hope itself should minister
   strength to us, and enable us patiently to bear these light
   afflictions, which are but for a moment.' This also is a truth full of
   sacred refreshment: hope sees a crown in reserve, mansions in
   readiness, and Jesus himself preparing a place for us, and by the
   rapturous sight she sustains the soul under the sorrows of the hour.
   Hope is the grand anchor by whose means we ride out the present storm.

   The apostle then turns to a third source of comfort, namely, the
   abiding of the Holy Spirit in and with the Lord's people. He uses the
   word likewise' to intimate that in the same manner as hope sustains the
   soul, so does the Holy Spirit strengthen us under trial. Hope operated
   spiritually upon our spiritual faculties, and so does the Holy Spirit,
   in some mysterious way, divinely operate upon the new-born faculties of
   the believer, so that he is sustained under his infirmities. In his
   light shall we see light: I pray, therefore, that we may be helped of
   the Spirit while we consider his mysterious operations, that we may not
   fall into error or miss precious truth through blindness of heart.

   The text speaks of our infirmities,' or as many translators put it in
   the singular'of our infirmity.' By this is intended our affliction, and
   the weakness which trouble discovers in us. The Holy Spirit helps us to
   bear the infirmity of our body and of our mind; he helps us to bear our
   cross, whether it be physical pain, or mental depression, or spiritual
   conflict, or slander, or poverty, or persecution. He helps our
   infirmity; and with a helper so divinely strong we need not fear for
   the result. God's grace will be sufficient for us; his strength will be
   made perfect in weakness.

   I think, dear friends, you will all admit that if a man can pray, his
   trouble is at once lightened. When we feel that we have power with God
   and can obtain anything we ask for at his hands, then our difficulties
   cease to oppress us. We take our burden to our heavenly Father and tell
   it out in the accents of childlike confidence, and we come away quite
   content to bear whatever his holy will may lay upon us. Prayer is a
   great outlet for grief; it draws up the sluices, and abates the
   swelling flood, which else might be too strong for us. We bathe our
   wound in the lotion of prayer, and the pain is lulled, the fever is
   removed. We may be brought into such perturbation of mind, and
   perplexity of heart, that we do not know how to pray. We see the
   mercy-seat, and we perceive that God will hear us: we have no doubt
   about that, for we know that we are his own favoured children, and yet
   we hardly know what to desire. We fall into such heaviness of spirit,
   and entanglement of thought, that the one remedy of prayer, which we
   have always found to be unfailing, appears to be taken from us. Here,
   then, in the nick of time, as a very present help in time of trouble,
   comes in the Holy Spirit. He draws near to teach us how to pray, and in
   this way he helps our infirmity, relieves our suffering, and enables us
   to bear the heavy burden without fainting under the load.

   At this time our subjects for consideration shall be, firstly, the help
   which the Holy Spirit gives; secondly, the prayers which he inspires;
   and thirdly, the success which such prayers ore certain to obtain.

   I. First, then, let us consider THE HELP WHICH THE HOLY GHOST GIVES.

   The help which the Holy Ghost renders to us meets the weakness which we
   deplore. As I have already said, if in time of trouble a man can pray,
   his burden loses its weight. If the believer can take anything and
   everything to God, then he learns to glory in infirmity, and to rejoice
   in tribulation; but sometimes we are in such confusion of mind that we
   know not what we should pray for as we ought. In a measure, through our
   ignorance, we never know what we should pray for until we are taught of
   the Spirit of God, but there are times when this beclouding of the soul
   is dense indeed, and we do not even know what would help us out of our
   trouble if we could obtain it. He see the disease, but the name of the
   medicine is not known to us. We look over the many things which we
   might ask for of the Lord, and we feel that each of them would be
   helpful, but that none of them would precisely meet our case. For
   spiritual blessings which we know to be according to the divine will we
   could ask with confidence, but perhaps these would not meet our
   peculiar circumstances. There are other things for which we are allowed
   to ask, but we scarcely know whether, if we had them, they would really
   serve our turn, and we also feel a diffidence as to praying for them.
   In praying for temporal things we plead with measured voices, ever
   referring our petition for revision to the will of the Lord. Moses
   prayed that he might enter Canaan, but God denied him; and the man that
   was healed asked our Lord that he might be with him, but he received
   for answer, Go home to thy friends.' We pray evermore on such matters
   with this reserve, Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.' At
   times this very spirit of resignation appears to increase our spiritual
   difficulty, for we do not wish to ask for anything that would be
   contrary to the mind of God and yet we must ask for something. We are
   reduced to such straits that we must pray, but what shall be the
   particular subject of prayer we cannot for a while make out. Even when
   ignorance and perplexity are removed, we know not what we should pray
   for as we ought.' When we know the matter of prayer, we yet fail to
   pray in a right manner. We ask, but we are afraid that we shall not
   have, because we do not exercise the thought, or the faith, which we
   judge to be essential to prayer. We cannot at times command even the
   earnestness which is the life of supplication: a torpor steals over us,
   our heart is chilled, our hand is numbed, and we cannot wrestle with
   the angel. We know what to pray for as to objects, but we do not know
   what to pray for as we ought' it is the manner of the prayer which
   perplexes us, even when the matter is decided upon. How can I pray? My
   mind wanders: I chatter like a crane; I roar like a beast in pain; I
   moan in the brokenness of my heart, but oh, my God, I know not what it
   is my inmost spirit needs; or if I know it, I know not how to frame my
   petition aright before thee. I know not how to open my lips in thy
   majestic presence: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. My spiritual
   distress robs me of the power to pour out my heart before my God. Now,
   beloved, it is in such a plight as this that the Holy Ghost aids us
   with his divine help. and hence he is a very present help in time of
   trouble.'

   Coming to our aid in our bewilderment he instructs us. This is one of
   his frequent operations upon the mind of the believer: he shall teach
   you all things.' He instructs us as to our need, and as to the promises
   of God which refer to that need. He shows us where our deficiencies
   are, what our sins are, and what our necessities are; he sheds a light
   upon our condition, and makes us feel deeply our helplessness,
   sinfulness, and dire poverty; and then he casts the same light upon the
   promises of the Word, and lays home to the heart that very text which
   was intended to meet the occasion'the precise promise which was framed
   with foresight of our present distress. In that light he makes the
   promise shine in all its truthfulness, certainty, sweetness, and
   suitability, so that we, poor trembling sons of men, dare take that
   word into our mouth which first came out of God's mouth, and then come
   with it as an argument, and plead it before the throne of the heavenly
   grace. Our prevalence in prayer lies in the plea, Lord, do as thou hast
   said.' How greatly we ought to value the Holy Spirit, because when we
   are in the dark he gives us light, and when our perplexed spirit is so
   befogged and beclouded that it cannot see its own need, and cannot find
   out the appropriate promise in the Scriptures, the Spirit of God comes
   in and teaches us all things, and brings all things to our remembrance,
   whatsoever our Lord has told us. He guides us in prayer, and thus he
   helps our infirmity.

   But the blessed Spirit does more than this, he will often direct the
   mind to the special subject of prayer. He dwells within us as a
   counsellor, and points out to us what it is we should seek at the hands
   of God. We do not know why it is so, but we sometimes find our minds
   carried as by a strong under current into a particular line of prayer
   for some one definite object. It is not merely that our judgment leads
   us in that direction, though usually the Spirit of God acts upon us by
   enlightening our judgment, but we often feel an unaccountable and
   irresistible desire rising again and again within our heart, and this
   so presses upon us, that we not only utter the desire before God at our
   ordinary times for prayer, but we feel it crying in our hearts all the
   day long, almost to the supplanting of all other considerations. At
   such times we should thank God for direction and give our desire a
   clear road: the Holy Spirit is granting us inward direction as to how
   we should reckon upon good success in our pleadings. Such guidance will
   the Spirit give to each of you if you will ask him to illuminate you.
   He will guide you both negatively and positively. Negatively, he will
   forbid you to pray for such and such a thing, even as Paul essayed to
   go into Bithynia, but the Spirit suffered him not: and, on other hand,
   he will cause you to hear a cry within your soul which shall guide your
   petitions, even as he made Paul hear the cry from Macedonia, saying,
   Come over and help us.' The Spirit teaches wisely, as no other teacher
   can do. Those who obey his promptings shall not walk in darkness. He
   leads the spiritual eye to take good and steady aim at the very centre
   of the target, and thus we hit the mark in our pleadings.

   Nor is this all, for the spirit of God is not sent merely to guide and
   help our devotion, but he himself maketh intercession for us' according
   to the will of God. By this expression it cannot be meant that the Holy
   Spirit ever groans or personally prays; but that he excites intense
   desire and created unutterable groanings in us, and these are ascribed
   to him. Even as Solomon built the temple because he superintended and
   ordained all, and yet I know not that he ever fashioned a timber or
   prepared a stone, so doth the Holy Spirit pray and plead within us by
   leading us to pray and plead. This he does by arousing our desires. The
   Holy Spirit has a wonderful power over renewed hearts, as much power as
   the skillful minstrel hath over the strings among which he lays his
   accustomed hand. The influences of the Holy Ghost at times pass through
   the soul like winds through an Eolian harp, creating and inspiring
   sweet notes of gratitude and tones of desire, to which we should have
   been strangers if it had not been for his divine visitation. He can
   arouse us from our lethargy, he can warm us out of our lukewarmness, he
   can enable us when we are on our knees to rise above the ordinary
   routine of prayer into that victorious importunity against which
   nothing can stand. He can lay certain desires so pressingly upon our
   hearts that we can never rest till they are fulfilled. He can make the
   zeal for God's house to eat us up, and the passion for God's glory to
   be like a fire within our bones; and this is one part of that process
   by which in inspiring our prayers he helps our infirmity. True Advocate
   is he, and Comforter most effectual. Blessed be his name.

   The Holy Spirit also divinely operates in the strengthening of the
   faith of believers. That faith is at first of his creating, and
   afterwards it is of his sustaining and increasing: and oh, brothers and
   sisters, have you not often felt your faith rise in proportion to your
   trials? Have you not, like Noah's ark, mounted towards heaven as the
   flood deepened around you? You have felt as sure about the promise as
   you felt about the trial. The affliction was, as it were, in your very
   bones, but the promise was also in your very heart. You could not doubt
   the affliction, for you smarted under it, but you might almost as soon
   have doubted the divine help, for your confidence was firm and unmoved.
   The greatest faith is only what God has a right to expect from us, yet
   do we never exhibit it except as the Holy Ghost strengthens our
   confidence, and opens up before us the covenant with all its seals and
   securities. He it is that leads our soul to cry, though my house be not
   so with God, yet hath he made with me an everlasting covenant ordered
   in all things and sure.' Blessed be the Divine Spirit then, that since
   faith is essential to prevailing prayer, he helps us in supplication by
   increasing our faith. Without faith prayer cannot speed, for he that
   wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed, and
   such an one may not expect anything of the Lord; happy are we when the
   Holy Spirit removes our wavering, and enables us like Abraham to
   believe without staggering, knowing full well that he who has promised
   is able also to perform.

   By three figures I will endeavour to describe the work of the Spirit of
   God in this matter, though they all fall short, and indeed all that I
   can say must fall infinitely short of the glory of his work. The actual
   mode of his working upon the mind we may not attempt to explain; it
   remains a mystery, and it would be an unholy intrusion to attempt to
   remove the veil. There is no difficulty in our believing that as one
   human mind operates upon another mind, so does the Holy Spirit
   influence our spirits. We are forced to use words if we would influence
   our fellow-men, but the Spirit of God can operate upon the human mind
   more directly, and communicate with it in silence. Into that matter,
   however, we will not dive lest we intrude where our knowledge would be
   drowned by our presumption.

   My illustrations do not touch the mystery, but set forth the grace. The
   Holy Spirit acts to his people somewhat as a prompter to a reciter. A
   man has to deliver a piece which he has learned; but his memory is
   treacherous, and therefore somewhere out of sight there is a prompter,
   so that when the speaker is at a loss and might use a wrong word, a
   whisper is heard, which suggests the right one. When the speaker has
   almost lost the thread of his discourse he turns his ear, and the
   prompter gives him the catch-word and aids his memory. If I may be
   allowed the simile, I would say that this represents in part the work
   of the Spirit of God in us,'suggesting to us the right desire, and
   bringing all things to our remembrance whatsoever Christ has told us.
   In prayer we should often come to a dead stand, but he incites,
   suggests, and inspires, and so we go onward. In prayer we might grow
   weary, but the Comforter encourages and refreshes us with cheering
   thoughts. When, indeed, we are in our bewilderment almost driven to
   give up prayer, the whisper of his love drops a live coal from off the
   altar into our soul, and our hearts glow with greater ardour than
   before. Regard the Holy Spirit as your prompter, and let your ear be
   opened to his voice.

   But he is much more than this. Let me attempt a second simile: he is as
   an advocate to one in peril at law. Suppose that a poor man had a great
   law-suit, touching his whole estate, and he was forced personally to go
   into court and plead his own cause, and speak up for his rights. If he
   were an uneducated man he would be in a poor plight. An adversary in
   the court might plead against him, and overthrow him, for he could not
   answer him. This poor man knows very little about law, and is quite
   unable to meet his cunning opponent. Suppose one who was perfect in the
   law should take up his cause warmly, and come and live with him, and
   use all his knowledge so as to prepare his case for him, draw up his
   petitions for him, and fill his mouth with arguments,'would not that be
   a grand relief? This counsellor would suggest the line of pleading,
   arrange the arguments, and put them into right courtly language. When
   the poor man was baffled by a question asked in court, he would run
   home and ask his adviser, and he would tell him exactly how to meet the
   objector. Suppose, too, that when he had to plead with the judge
   himself, this advocate at home should teach him how to behave and what
   to urge, and encourage him to hope that he would prevail,'would not
   this be a great boon? Who would be the pleader in such a case? The poor
   client would plead, but still, when he won the suit, he would trace it
   all to the advocate who lived at home, and gave him counsel: indeed, it
   would be the advocate pleading for him, even while he pleaded himself.
   This is an instructive emblem of a great fact. Within this narrow house
   of my body, this tenement of clay, if I be a true believer, there
   dwells the Holy Ghost, and when I desire to pray I may ask him what I
   should pray for as I ought, and he will help me. He will write the
   prayers which I ought to offer upon the tablets of my heart, and I
   shall see them there, and so I shall be taught how to plead. It will be
   the Spirit's own self pleading in me, and by me, and through me, before
   the throne of grace. What a happy man in his law-suit would such a poor
   man be, and how happy are you and I that we have the Holy Ghost to be
   our Counsellor!

   Yet one more illustration: it is that of a father aiding his boy.
   Suppose it to be a time of war centuries back. Old English warfare was
   then conducted by bowmen to a great extent. Here is a youth who is to
   be initiated in the art of archery, and therefore he carries a bow. It
   is a strong bow, and therefore very hard to draw; indeed, it requires
   more strength than the urchin can summon to bend it. See how his father
   teaches him. Put your right hand here, my boy, and place your left hand
   so. Now pull'; and as the youth pulls, his father's hands are on his
   hands, and the bow is drawn. The lad draws the bow: ay, but it is quite
   as much his father, too. We cannot draw the bow of prayer alone.
   Sometimes a bow of steel is not broken by our hands, for we cannot even
   bend it; and then the Holy Ghost puts his mighty hand over ours, and
   covers our weakness so that we draw; and lo, what splendid drawing of
   the bow it is them! The bow bends so easily we wonder how it is; away
   flies the arrow, and it pierces the very centre of the target, for he
   who giveth have won the day, but it was his secret might that made us
   strong, and to him be the glory of it.

   Thus have I tried to set forth the cheering fact that the Spirit helps
   the people of God.

   II. Our second subject is THE PRAYER WHICH THE HOLY SPIRIT INSPIRES, or
   that part of prayer which is especially and peculiarly the work of the
   Spirit of God. The text says, The Spirit itself maketh intercession for
   us with groanings which cannot be uttered.' It is not the Spirit that
   groans, but we that groan; but as I have shown you, the Spirit excited
   the emotion which causes us to groan.

   It is clear then the prayers which are indited in us by the spirit of
   God are those which arise from our inmost soul. A man's heart is moved
   when he groans. A groan is a matter about which there is no hypocrisy.
   A groan cometh not from the lips, but from the heart. A groan then is a
   part of prayer which we owe to the Holy Ghost, and the same is true of
   all the prayer which wells up from the deep fountains of our inner
   life. The prophet cried, My bowels, my bowels, I am pained at my very
   heart: my heart maketh a noise in me.' This deep ground-swell of
   desire, this tidal motion of the life-floods is caused by the Holy
   Spirit. His work is never superficial, but always deep and inward.

   Such prayers will rise within us when the mind is far too troubled to
   let us speak. We know not what we should pray for as we ought, and then
   it is that we groan, or utter some other inarticulate sound. Hezekiah
   said, like a crane or a swallow did I chatter.' The psalmist said, I am
   so troubled that I cannot I have roared by reason of the disquietness
   of my heart'; but he added, Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my
   groaning is not hid from thee.' The sighing of the prisoner surely
   cometh up into the ears of the Lord. There is real prayer in these
   groanings that cannot be uttered.' It is the power of the Holy Ghost in
   us which creates all real prayer, even that which takes the form of a
   groan because the mind is incapable, by reason of its bewilderment and
   grief, of clothing its emotion in words. I pray you never think lightly
   of the supplications of your anguish. Rather judge that such prayers
   are like Jabez, of whom it is written, that he was more honourable than
   his brethren, because his mother bare him with sorrow.' That which is
   thrown up from the depth of the soul, when it is stirred with a
   terrible tempest, is more precious than pearl or coral, for it is the
   intercession of the Holy Spirit.

   These prayers are sometimes groanings that cannot be uttered,' because
   they concern such great things that they cannot be spoken. I want, my
   Lord! I want, I want; I cannot tell thee what I want: but I seem to
   want all things. If it were some little thing, my narrow capacity could
   comprehend and describe it, but I need all covenant blessings. Thou
   knowest what I have need of before I ask thee, and though I cannot go
   into each item of my need, I know it to be very great, and such as I
   myself can never estimate. I groan, for I can do no more. Prayers which
   are the offspring of great desires, sublime aspirations, and elevated
   designs are surely the work of the Holy Spirit, and their power within
   a man is frequently so great that he cannot find expression for them.
   Words fail, and even the sighs which try to embody them cannot be
   uttered.

   But it may be, beloved, that we groan because we are conscious of the
   littleness of our desire, and the narrowness of our faith. The trial,
   too. may seem too mean to pray about. I have known what it is to feel
   as if I could not pray about a certain matter, and yet I have been
   obliged to groan about it. A thorn in the flesh may be as painful a
   thing as a sword in the bones, and yet we may go and beseech the Lord
   thrice about it, and getting no answer we may feel that we know not
   what to pray for as we ought; and yet it makes us groan. Yes, and with
   that natural groan there may go up an unutterable groaning of the Holy
   Spirit. Beloved, what a different view of prayer God has from that
   which men think to be the correct one. You may have seen very beautiful
   prayers in print, and you may have heard very charming compositions
   from the pulpit, but I trust you have not fallen in love with them.
   Judge these things rightly. I pray you never think well of fine
   prayers, for before the thrice holy God it ill becomes a sinful
   suppliant to play the orator. We heard of a certain clergyman who was
   said to have given forth the finest prayer ever offered to a Boston
   audience.' Just so! The Boston audience received the prayer, and there
   it ended. We want the mind of the spirit in prayer, and not he mind of
   the flesh. The tail feathers of pride should be pulled out of our
   prayers, for they need only the wing feathers of faith; the peacock
   feathers of poetical expression are out of place before the throne of
   God. Hear me, what remarkably beautiful language he used in prayer!'
   What an intellectual treat his prayer was! Yes, yes; but God looks at
   the heart. To him fine language is as sounding brass or tinkling
   cymbal, but a groan has music in it. We do not like groans: our ears
   are much too delicate to tolerate such dreary sounds; but not so the
   great Father of spirits. A Methodist brother cries, Amen,' and you say,
   I cannot bear such Methodistic noise'; no, but if it comes from the
   man's heart God can bear it. When you get upstairs into your chamber
   this evening to pray, and find you cannot pray, but have to moan out,
   Lord, I am too full of anguish and too perplexed to pray, hear thou the
   voice of my roaring,' though you reach to nothing else you will be
   really praying. When like David we can say, I opened my mouth and
   panted,' we are by no means in an ill state of mind. All fine language
   in prayer, and especially all intoning or performing of prayers, must
   be abhorrent to God; it is little short of profanity to offer solemn
   supplication to God after the manner called intoning.' The sighing of a
   true heart is infinitely more acceptable, for it is the work of the
   Spirit of God.

   We may say of the prayers which the Holy Spirit works in us that they
   are prayers of knowledge. Notice, our difficulty is that we know not
   what we should pray for; but the Holy Spirit does know, and therefore
   he helps us by enabling us to pray intelligently, knowing what we are
   asking for, so far as this knowledge is needful to valid prayer. The
   text speaks of the mind of the Spirit.' What a mind that must be!'the
   mind of that Spirit who arranged all the order which now pervades this
   earth! There once was chaos and confusion, but the Holy Spirit brooded
   over all, and His mind is the originator of that beautiful arrangement
   which we so admire in the visible creation. What a mind his must be!
   The Holy Spirit's mind is seen in our intercessions when under his
   sacred influence we order our case before the Lord, and plead with holy
   wisdom for things convenient and necessary. What wise and admirable
   desires must those be which the Spirit of Wisdom himself works in us!

   Moreover, the Holy Spirit's intercession creates prayers offered in a
   proper manner. I showed you that the difficulty is that we know not
   what we should pray for as we ought,' and the Spirit meets that
   difficulty by making intercession for us in a right manner. The Holy
   Spirit works in us humility, earnestness, intensity, importunity,
   faith, and resignation, and all else that is acceptable to God in our
   supplications. We know not how to mingle these sacred spices in the
   incense of prayer. We, if left to ourselves at our very best, get too
   much of one ingredient or another, and spoil the sacred compound, but
   the Holy Spirit's intercessions have in them such a blessed blending of
   all that is good that they come up as a sweet perfume before the Lord.
   Spirit-taught prayers are offered as they ought to be. They are his own
   intercession in some respects, for we read that the Holy Spirit not
   only helps us to intercede but maketh intercession.' It is twice over
   declared in our text that he maketh intercession for us; and the
   meaning of this I tried to show when I described a father as putting
   his hands upon his child's hands. This is something more than helping
   us to pray, something more than encouraging us or directing us,'but I
   venture no further, except to say that he puts such force of his own
   mind into our poor weak thoughts and desires and hopes, that he himself
   maketh intercession for us, working in us to will and to pray according
   to his good pleasure.

   I want you to notice, however, that these intercessions of the Spirit
   are only in the saints. He maketh intercession for us,' and He maketh
   intercession for the saints.' Does he do nothing for sinners, then?
   Yes, he quickens sinners into spiritual life, and he strives with them
   to overcome their sinfulness and turn them into the right way; but in
   the saints he works with us and enables us to pray after his mind and
   according to the will of God. His intercession is not in or for the
   unregenerate. O, unbelievers you must first be made saints or you
   cannot feel the Spirit's intercession within you. What need we have to
   go to Christ for the blessing of the Holy Ghost, which is peculiar to
   the children of God, and can only be ours by faith in Christ Jesus! To
   as man as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of
   God'; and to the sons of God alone cometh the Spirit of adoption, and
   all his helping grace. Unless we are the sons of God the Holy Spirit's
   indwelling shall not be ours: we are shut out from the intercession of
   the Holy Ghost, ay, and from the intercession of Jesus too, for he hath
   said, I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me.'

   Thus I have tried to show you the kind of prayer which the Spirit
   inspires.

   III. Our third and last point is THE SURE SUCCESS OF ALL SUCH PRAYERS.

   All the prayers which the Spirit of God inspires in us must succeed,
   because, first, there is a meaning in them which God reads and
   approves. When the Spirit of God writes a prayer upon a man's heart,
   the man himself may be in such a state of mind that he does not
   altogether know what it is. His interpretation of it is a groan, and
   that is all. Perhaps he does not even get so far as that in expressing
   the mind of the Spirit, but he feels greenings which he cannot utter,
   he cannot find a door of utterance for his inward grief. Yet our
   heavenly Father, who looks immediately upon the heart, reads what the
   Spirit of God has indited there, and does not need even our groans to
   explain the meaning. He reads the heart itself: he knoweth,' says the
   text, what is the mind of the Spirit.' The Spirit is one with the
   Father, and the Father knows what the Spirit means. The desires which
   the Spirit prompts may be too spiritual for such babes in grace as we
   are actually to describe or to express, and yet the Spirit writes the
   desire on the renewed mind, and the Father sees it. Now that which God
   reads in the heart and approves of'for the word to know' in this case
   includes approval as well as the mere act of omniscience'what God sees
   and approves of in the heart must succeed. Did not Jesus say, Your
   heavenly Father knoweth that you have need of these things before you
   ask them'? Did he not tell us this as an encouragement to believe that
   we shall receive all needful blessings? So it is with those prayers
   which are all broken up, wet with tears, and discordant with those
   sighs and inarticulate expressions and heavings of the bosom, and
   sobbings of the heart and anguish and bitterness of spirit, our
   gracious Lord reads them as a man reads a book, and they are written in
   a character which he fully understands. To give a simple figure: if I
   were to come into your house I might find there a little child that
   cannot yet speak plainly. It cries for something, and it makes very odd
   and objectionable noises, combined with signs and movements, which are
   almost meaningless to stranger, but his mother understands him, and
   attends to his little pleadings. A mother can translate baby-talk: she
   comprehends incomprehensible noises. Even so doth our Father in heaven
   know all about our poor baby talk, for our prayer is not much better.
   He knows and comprehends the cryings, and meanings, and sighings, and
   chatterings of his bewildered children. Yea, a tender mother knows her
   child's needs before the child knows what it wants. Perhaps the little
   one stutters, stammers, and cannot get its words out, but the mother
   sees what he would say, and takes the meaning. Even so we know
   concerning our great Father:'

   He knows the thoughts we mean to speak,

   Ere from our opening lips the break.'

   Do you therefore rejoice in this, that because the prayers of the
   Spirit are known and understood of God, therefore they will be sure to
   speed.

   The next argument for making us sure that they will speed is this'that
   they are the mind of the Spirit.' God the ever blessed is one, and
   there can be no division between the Father, the Son, and the Holy
   Ghost. These divine persons always work together, and there is a common
   desire for the glory of each blessed Person of the Divine Unity, and
   therefore it cannot be conceived without profanity, that anything could
   be the mind of the Holy Spirit and not be the mind of the Father and
   the mind of the Son. The mind of God is one and harmonious; if,
   therefore, the Holy Spirit dwells in you, and he move you to any
   desire, then his mind is in your prayer, and it is not possible that
   the eternal Father should reject your petitions. That prayer which came
   from heaven will certainly go back to heaven. If the Holy Ghost prompts
   it, the Father must and will accept it, for it is not possible that he
   should put a slight upon the ever blessed and adorable Spirit.

   But one more word, and that circles the argument, namely, that the work
   of the Spirit in the heart is not only the mind of the Spirit which God
   knows, but it is also according to the will or mind of God, for he
   never maketh intercession in us other than is consistent with the
   divine will. Now, the divine will or mind may be viewed two ways.
   First, there is the will declared in the proclamations of holiness by
   the Ten Commandments. The Spirit of God never prompts us to ask for
   anything that is unholy or inconsistent with the precepts of the Lord.
   Then secondly, there is the secret mind of God, the will of his eternal
   predestination and decree, of which we know nothing; but we do know
   this, that the Spirit of God never prompts us to ask anything which is
   contrary to the eternal purpose of God. Reflect for a moment: the Holy
   Spirit knows all the purposes of God, and when they are about to be
   fulfilled, he moves the children of God to pray about them, and so
   their prayers keep touch and tally with the divine decrees. Oh would
   you not pray confidently if you knew that your prayer corresponded with
   the sealed book of destiny? We may safely entreat the Lord to do what
   he has ordained to do. A carnal man draws the inference that if God has
   ordained an event we need not pray about it, but faith obediently draws
   the inference that the God who secretly ordained to give the blessing
   has openly commanded that we should pray for it, and therefore faith
   obediently prays. Coming events cast their shadows before them, and
   when God is about to bless his people his coming favour casts the
   shadow of prayer over the church. When he is about to favour an
   individual he casts the shadow of hopeful expectation over his soul.
   Our prayers, let men laugh at them as they will, and say there is no
   power in them, are the indicators of the movement of the wheels of
   Providence. Believing supplications are forecasts of the future, He who
   prayeth in faith is like the seer of old, he sees that which is to be:
   his holy expectancy, like a telescope, brings distant objects near to
   him. He is bold to declare that he has the petition which he has asked
   of God, and he therefore begins to rejoice and to praise God, even
   before the blessing has actually arrived. So it is: prayer prompted by
   the Holy Spirit is the footfall of the divine decree.

   I conclude by saying, see, my dear hearers, the absolute necessity of
   the Holy Spirit, for if the saints know not what they should pray for
   as they ought; if consecrated men and women, with Christ suffering in
   them, still feel their need of the instruction of the Holy Spirit, how
   much more do you who are not saints, and have never given yourselves up
   to God, require divine teaching! On, that you would know and feel your
   dependence upon the Holy Ghost that he may prompt the once crucified
   but now ascended Redeemer that this gift of the Spirit, this promise of
   the Father, is shed abroad upon men. May he who comes from Jesus lead
   you to Jesus.

   And, then O ye people of God, let this last thought abide with
   you,'what condescension is this that Divine Person should dwell in you
   for ever, and that he should be with you to help your prayers. Listen
   to me for a moment. If I read in the Scriptures that in the most heroic
   acts of faith God the Holy Ghost helpeth his people, I can understand
   it; if I read that in the sweetest music of their songs when they
   worship best, and chant their loftiest strains before the Most High
   God, the Spirit helpeth them, I can understand it; and even if I hear
   that in their wrestling prayers and prevalent intercessions God the
   Holy Spirit helpeth them, I can understand it: but I bow with reverent
   amazement, my heart sinking into the dust with adoration, when I
   reflect that God the Holy Ghost helps us when we cannot speak, but only
   groan. Yea, and when we cannot even utter our groanings, he doth not
   only help us but he claims as his own particular creation the groanings
   that cannot be uttered.' This is condescension indeed! In deigning to
   help us in the grief that cannot even vent itself in groaning, he
   proves himself to be a true Comforter. O God, my God, thou hast not
   forsaken me: thou art not far from me, nor from the voice of my
   roaring. Thou didst for awhile leave the Firstborn when he was made a
   curse for us, so that he cried in agony, Why hast thou forsaken me?'
   but thou wilt not leave one of the many brethren' for whom he died: the
   Spirit shall be with them, and when they cannot so much as groan he
   will make intercession for them with groanings that cannot be uttered.
   God bless you, my beloved brethren, and may you feel the Spirit of the
   Lord thus working in you and with you. Amen and amen.

Fear Not

   (No. 1533)

   DELIVERED ON TUESDAY EVENING, MARCH 9, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE SHOREDITCH TABERNACLE, ERECTED FOR THE CONGREGATION OF PASTOR W.
   CUFF.

   "Fear not." Revelation 1:17.

   "FEAR not" is a plant which grows very plentifully in God's garden. If
   you look through the lily beds of Scripture you will continually find,
   by the side of other flowers, the sweet, "Fear nots" peering out from
   doctrines and precepts even as violets look up from their hiding among
   places of green leaves. "Fear nots" bloomed in the old times at the
   feet of Abraham when he returned from fighting with the kings.
   Melchisedec blessed him and the Lord comforted him. The Patriarch might
   have been half afraid that he would always lead a troubled life, now
   that he had once drawn the sword. But the Lord came to him in vision
   and said, "Fear not, Abram. I am your shield and your exceedingly great
   reward." If he had to undergo a soldier's toils, he should have a
   soldier's shield and a soldier's pay and both should be exceedingly
   great, for he should find them both in God!

   After you have been fighting battles for Christ you may feel weary and
   worried and then your great Melchisedec will refresh you with bread and
   wine and whisper in your ear, "Fear not." A "Fear not" was spoken to
   Isaac when he had dug wells and the Philistines fought for them and he,
   like the meek soul that he was, gave them up, one by one, to avoid a
   conflict. At last he settled down at Beersheba and there the Lord
   appeared unto him and said, "Fear not, for I am with you and will bless
   you." He was a feeble man and, therefore, the Lord dealt tenderly with
   him. If any of you are meek and quiet spirits and rather apt to tremble
   exceedingly, may the Lord often give you a blessed, "Fear not" to wear
   in your bosoms that its fragrance may comfort your hearts.

   Then there was Jacob. You know how troubled his life was, but when he
   heard that his beloved son whom he thought was dead was alive in Egypt
   and was clothed with glory and that he had sent for him to go down to
   see him, he was afraid to go till the Lord said to him, "Fear not to go
   down into Egypt," and gave him this encouraging promise, "I will go
   down with you into Egypt." If any of you are making a great change in
   life and moving, perhaps, to the very ends of the earth, "fear not to
   go down into Egypt!" Should God command you to go to the utmost edge of
   the green earth, to rivers unknown to you, yet if He bids you go, fear
   not to go down into Egypt, for certainly He will be with you!

   The Israelites at the Red Sea were afraid of Pharaoh and then the Lord
   said to them, "Fear not, stand still and see the salvation of God." If
   you are brought to a pass tonight and know not what to do, take the
   advice of Holy Scripture and, "Fear not"--"stand still and see the
   salvation of God." As we observe the Scriptures we perceive that "Fear
   nots" are scattered throughout the Bible as the stars are sprinkled
   over the whole of the sky. But when we come to Isaiah, we find
   constellations of them! When I was a boy I learned Dr. Watts' Catechism
   and I am glad I did. One of its questions runs thus, "Who was Isaiah?"
   And the answer is, "He was that Prophet who spoke more of Jesus Christ
   than all the rest."

   Very well and for that very reason--that he spoke more of Jesus Christ
   than all the rest--he is richest in comfort to the people of God and
   continually he is saying, "Fear not." Here are a few of his antidotes
   for the fever of fear--"Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be
   strong, fear not." "Fear you not, for I am with you; be not dismayed,
   for I am your God." "Fear not, I will help you." "Fear not, you worm
   Jacob." "Fear not, I have redeemed you." "Fear not, for you shall not
   be ashamed; neither be you confounded, for you shall not be put to
   shame" and so on. I was going to say, "world without end." So abundant
   are these, "Fear nots," that they grow like the king-cups and the
   daisies and other sweet flowers of the meadows among which the little
   children in the springtime delight themselves. As to gathering them
   all, no one would attempt the task. The bank that is fullest of these
   beautiful flowers is that which Isaiah has cast up--go there and pluck
   them for yourselves.

   Now I gather from the plentifulness of "Fear nots," even in the Old
   Testament, that the Lord does not wish His people to be afraid. I
   gather that He is glad to see His people full of courage and especially
   that He does not love them to be afraid of Him. He would have His
   children treat Him with confidence. Slavish fear may be thought to be
   congenial to the Old Testament and yet it is not so, for there the Lord
   cries to His chosen, "Fear not." When we come into the New Testament,
   there we see God coming more familiarly to men than ever before--not
   descending upon Paran with 10,000 flaming chariots, setting the
   mountain on a blaze--but coming down to Bethlehem in an Infant's form
   with angels chanting the joyful words, "Glory to God in the highest and
   on earth peace, goodwill toward men."

   The genius of the New Testament is drawing near to God--ceasing to
   tremble and beginning to trust--ceasing to be the slave and learning to
   be the child! Though in the precise form of it, the words of my text
   were not very often spoken by the Lord Jesus Christ, yet His whole life
   was one long proclamation of, "Fear not." I think I shall give you,
   to-night, most of the instances in which our Lord Himself expressly
   said, "Fear not," and, as each one I shall give you will either come
   from the lips of Christ, or else from Christ's own angel sent to
   comfort one of His servants, I pray that it may come fresh from God to
   every tried and troubled Believer and that all of us, together, may
   receive for our different fears this one same solace from the mouth of
   the Eternal, "Thus says the Lord unto you, fear not."

   I. Our first text you will kindly look for if you have your Bibles with
   you. I hope you all have them, for I love to hear the rustling of Bible
   pages as we do in Scotland, but not often in England. Turn to the Book
   of Revelation, the first chapter and the 17th verse and there you will
   read that John beheld the Savior in His glorious array and he says,
   "When I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. And He laid His right hand
   upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the First and the Last." Our
   first, "Fear not," MEETS THE DREAD OCCASIONED BY THE MAJESTY OF OUR
   SAVIOR'S PERSON. You that know Him hold Him in deepest reverence, even
   as John did when, at the sight of his Divine Lord, he fell at His feet
   as dead.

   Did you ever think of Jesus as Divine and try to form some idea of His
   grandeur, His triumph and His exaltation above the thrones and
   principalities of Heaven? As your soul has extolled Him and your mind
   has been expanded with high thoughts of the All-Glorious Son of God,
   has it not occurred to you to say within yourself, "How dare I think
   that He is my Beloved and that I am His? Could such Majesty meet such
   misery? Could such Glory bring itself into union with such
   insignificance as mine?''" I know you must have experienced that
   feeling and yet you must not yield to it, for our Lord Jesus, although
   He loves to see your holy awe, would not have that reverence freeze
   into a chill reserve or a slavish trembling! No, though He is Divine,
   He invites you to approach Him without dread! Great as He is, you may
   dare to be free with Him--

   "Let us be simple with Him, then--

   Not backward, stiff, or cold,

   As though our Bethlehem could be

   What Sinai was of old."

   Let your Lord be glorious to you, but still let Him be near you. Exalt
   Him on His throne, but remember that you sit there with Him. However
   glorious He may be, He has desired that you may behold His Glory and be
   with Him where He is. To you has He given to overcome and to sit upon
   His Throne even as He has overcome and has sat down with the Father
   upon His Throne. If you have studied the matchless purity of His
   Character with adoring admiration, you must have been amazed at the
   absolute perfection of His Manhood and the Glory of His moral and
   spiritual Character. At such times, if you have had a true sense of
   your own position, you have been ready to sink into the dust and you
   have exclaimed, "Shall He wash my feet? Shall He give Himself for me?
   Can it be that He could have loved one so stained and polluted, so mean
   and so beggarly, so altogether unworthy even to live, much less to be
   loved by such an altogether

   lovely One?"

   I pray you will always remember, when you think of His perfection, that
   He has perfection of mercy as well as of holiness and perfection of
   love to sinners as well as perfection of hatred of sin--and that,
   guilty as you are, you must never doubt His affection, for He has
   pledged you in His heart's blood and proved His love by His death!
   Albeit that you are conscious of being less than nothing and vanity and
   know that Jesus is absolute Perfection, yet regard Him not with
   timorous dread, but draw near to Him as confidently as a child to its
   parent, or a wife to her husband. It is one of Satan's temptations to
   make us afraid of Christ. Let us not be ignorant of his devices. Why
   should you be afraid of Jesus when He

   tells you not to be? Why dread the Lamb of God? He says, "Fear not." It
   is not the preacher who cries, "Fear not," but it is Jesus Himself who
   whispers to His poor servant, fallen as dead at His feet, "Fear not:
   fear not."

   It will be disobedience, then, to be afraid. When those lips, which are
   as lilies dropping sweet-smelling myrrh, say to me, "Child of Mine,
   fear not," how can I be afraid? Your safety lies, remember, dear
   Friend, in trusting Jesus and not in being afraid of Him. There was
   never a soul yet saved by being afraid of Christ--there was never a
   prodigal that found forgiveness yet by being afraid of his father! This
   kind of fear needs casting out, for it has torment. Jesus, our Lord, is
   great and good and He has chosen to become the Savior of sinners and we
   need not fear to approach Him, for, "this Man receives sinners." A Host
   that entertains at His table the poorest of the poor and the lowest of
   the low and bids them welcome is not one to be feared! Remember that if
   you are honestly afraid of Jesus, you must be afraid of grieving Him by
   being afraid of Him.

   When the physician sees the patient shrinking from his knife, he does
   not wonder, but when Jesus sees you shrinking from that hand which does
   not wound, but cures by its own wound, He looks with eyes of sorrow
   upon such fear! Why shrink from Him? The little children ran into His
   arms! Why shrink from Him? Nothing cuts Him to the quick more than the
   unkind, ungenerous thought that He is unwilling to receive the guilty.
   If He meant to keep you at a distance, He would have never left Heaven.
   His coming here cannot mean anything else than love to the
   perishing--therefore do not grieve Him by being afraid of Him! Remember
   that His truthfulness forbids the rejection of any that ever come to
   Him since He has pledged His Word that He will in no wise cast them
   out. You need not, therefore, be afraid that you, in particular, may
   not come.

   I had a letter but this week in which one poor soul says, "I believe
   that I am the worst person that ever lived, though not in outward
   appearance, yet in heart. I believe that all other sorts of people feel
   more than I do, or have some one point in which they are better than I
   am. I am the worst of all and I fear that Jesus will never look on me."
   Downcast Soul, there is no true ground for such a suspicion! If you had
   a devil in you, you might still come to Christ! And if there were a
   legion of devils in you--and I do not quite know how many make up a
   legion--but if there were so many that you could not count them, yet
   you may still come with all the devils in Hell in you and He would
   still not frown upon you! And He would cast the devils out of you! Oh,
   be not afraid to come to Him whose wounds invite you! The blessed
   Savior who receives sinners loves not that you should stay away through
   fear.

   I know what some of you are doing--you are trying to get to Heaven by a
   roundabout road. The late Emperor of Russia, when the railway was to be
   made between Moscow and St. Petersburg, employed a great number of
   engineers in making plans. He looked over many of their maps and, at
   last, like the practical man that he was, he said, "Here, bring me a
   ruler." They brought him a ruler. He took a pencil and, drawing a
   straight line, he said, "That is the way to engineer it--we need no
   other plan than one straight line." There are a great many ways of
   engineering souls to Heaven, but the only one that is worth considering
   is this--Draw a straight line to Christ at once!

   Did I hear one awakened soul say, "I should like to talk to Mr. Cuff"?
   By all means talk to him, but do not stop at that, nor stop for that.
   Go to Christ first! "Oh, but I should like to talk with a good woman--a
   dear Christian lady." I recommend you to go to Jesus Christ at once and
   see the lady afterwards! It is all very well to have an enquiry room
   and I have not a word to say against it, but the best enquiry room in
   the world is your own bedroom. Go and inquire of Christ straight away!
   We may make our Christian workers and leaders into little priests if we
   do not watch what we are doing. There must be nobody between a soul and
   Christ! Blind souls will never get their eyes opened by all the kind
   hands of all the good people in Shoreditch, or in all of London!
   Christ's hands can give sight and only His--and you may get to Christ
   tonight.

   "Which way?" you ask. By no movement of your body, but by a motion of
   your mind. Turn your thoughts towards Him, your desires towards Him,
   your trust towards Him. Look to Him and live! May the Holy Spirit lead
   you to trust Him now and He will save you. Thus have I tried very
   briefly to set forth the fear which arises from the majesty of the
   Divine Person of Christ for which He prescribes this cure--"Fear not, I
   am the First and the Last: I am He that lives and was dead; and behold
   I am alive forevermore." Do not be afraid of Jesus because of His
   Glory, nor stand back because of your unfitness. You need a Mediator
   between your soul and God, but you do not need a mediator between your
   souls and Christ. You may come to Him straight away just as you are!--

   "Come needy and guilty, come loathsome and bare;

   You can't come too filthy, come just as you are." Draw a straight
   line--remember that--a straight line from your lost condition to Christ
   and let your resolve be, "I, being lost, trust Jesus to save me and I
   am saved!"

   II. The second, "Fear not," is equally precious. Turn to Luke, the
   eighth chapter and the 50th verse, the chapter we were reading just now
   and there you will find that Jairus had a little daughter who was dead
   and they said--"Trouble not the Master. But when Jesus heard it, He
   answered him, saying, "Fear not: only believe and she shall be made
   whole."

   THIS MEETS THE FEAR ARISING OUT OF THE DESPERATENESS OF THE CASE IN
   HAND. The little girl was

   actually dead and yet Jesus said, "Fear not." Here is comfort as to
   others. Dear Friend, if you have been praying, for a long time, about
   someone who is near and dear to you. If you have been longing for that
   person's salvation and your prayer has not been answered. And even if
   that person has gone from bad to worse, I want you not to give up
   praying!

   "Oh, but," you say, "I am getting very downcast, for they are plunging
   into deeper sin." Well, there is cause for fear, but not while Jesus
   lives, for He can reach a soul as long as it remains on this side of
   the gates of Death! Jesus can still save a man while he is yet out of
   Hell! Continue to pray and fear not! No case is absolutely hopeless
   while Jesus lives! Love will still prevail. We meet, sometimes, with
   amazing instances where prayer is heard at last. I have read of a woman
   who prayed long for her husband. She used to attend a certain Meeting
   House in the north of England, but her husband never went with her. He
   was a drinking, swearing man and she had much anguish of heart about
   him. She never ceased to pray and yet she never saw any result.

   She went to the Meeting House quite alone, with this exception, that a
   dog always went with her and this faithful animal would curl himself up
   under the seat and lie quiet during the service. When she was dead, her
   husband was still unsaved, but doggie went to the Meeting House. His
   master wondered whatever the faithful animal did at the service.
   Curiosity made him follow the good creature. The dog led him down the
   aisle to his dear old mistress's seat. The man sat on that seat and the
   dog curled himself up as usual. God guided the minister that day--the
   Word came with power and that man wept till he found the Savior! Never
   give up your husbands, good women, for the Lord may even use a dog to
   bring them to Christ when you are dead and gone!

   Never give up praying, hoping and expecting. Fear not! Only believe and
   you shall have your heart's desire. Pray for them as long as there is
   breath in your body and theirs. It is of no use praying for them when
   they are dead, but as long as they are here, never cease to plead with
   God on their account. Persons have been converted to God under very
   extraordinary circumstances. Two base fellows thought to rob the house
   of a godly man, the vicar of the parish, who was accustomed, on Sunday
   evening, to gather his poor people together in his parlor and preach
   the Gospel to them. This was a little extra work after the day's
   services. The thieves thought that if they could get into the house
   with the people during the evening and hide themselves away, they could
   rob the house easily during the night.

   And so they got into the next room to that in which the Word was
   preached. But they never robbed that house, for through the godly
   vicar's address the Lord Jesus Christ stole away their hearts and they
   came forth to confess their sin and to become followers of the Savior!
   You do not know how far the arrows of the conquering Savior may fly!
   Never despair! Jesus Christ comforts you in reference to the souls of
   those for whom you are anxious by saying, "Fear not; only believe and
   they shall be made whole." Labor for them, pray for them and believe
   that Jesus Christ can save them! And let the same Truth of God be fully
   believed as to yourselves. O my dear Hearer, you may think you are too
   far gone for salvation, but you are not!

   You may imagine that your case is altogether a lot out of the catalog,
   but you are just the sort of person that Jesus Christ saves! If He
   never saved odd people, He would never have saved me, for many men
   judge me to be a strange being! If you are another oddity, come along
   with me and let us trust in Him! If you are the one man that is a
   little over the line of mercy, you are the very man that Jesus Christ
   chooses to bless, for He loves to save extraordinary sinners! He is a
   very extraordinary Savior--there never was another like He and when He
   meets a sinner that is extraordinary and never another like he, He
   often takes him and makes him one of His captains, as He did Saul of
   Tarsus who became Paul the Apostle! I pray you "fear not" on account of
   the greatness of your sin. Be humbled on account of it, but do not
   despair about it.

   Are you old in iniquity? Are you deeply ingrained in transgression by
   long practice in it? Still doubt not the Redeemer's power! If your
   salvation rested on yourself you might despair, but the Lord has laid
   help on One that is mighty,

   even on His only-begotten Son! And He is able to save to the uttermost
   them that come to God by Him. O poor condemned sinner, look up and
   hope! O you who have heard the clang of the iron gate--you who are shut
   up in despair-- have hope, have brave hope, for Jesus says to you,
   "Fear not, only believe and you shall be made whole." God grant that
   this gracious, "Fear not" may be a comfort to some seeker here.

   III. Our third, "Fear not," is taken from the fifth chapter of Luke
   beginning at the seventh verse. And perhaps what I am about to say will
   suit Mr. Cuff and other successful ministers--"They came and filled
   both the ships, so that they began to sink. When Simon Peter saw it, he
   fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful
   man, O Lord. For he was astonished and all that were with him, at the
   draught of the fishes which they had taken. And so was also James and
   John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus
   said unto Simon, Fear not, from henceforth you shall catch men."

   THIS MEETS THE FEAR WHICH ARISES OUT OF THE GREATNESS OF HIS GOODNESS.
   If the Lord has made any one of you successful in His service, if you
   are made of the same stuff as I am, your success lays you low before
   His Throne. Time was when everybody was abusing me and then I rejoiced
   and gloried in God--I had happy days when my name was cast out as evil.
   But when the Lord, in His great mercy, gave me souls for my hire and
   began to build up the Church at the Tabernacle, I became subject to
   such sinking of spirits that I can scarcely tell you how crushed I have
   been under the weight of Divine Mercy. I should not wonder if my dear
   Brother Cuff has gone home, after seeing a crowd at the Town Hall and
   after seeing this great house full and has said, "Lord, why have You
   been pleased to use me and to favor me?"

   If any of you are blessed in your work, as I trust you may be, you may
   also be made to feel the mysterious depression which takes the place of
   self-exaltation in those who know that every good gift comes from God
   alone. Fear because of the Lord's great goodness, also comes in another
   shape--a person says, "I believe that I am saved for I have looked to
   Christ and I am lightened. And yet can it be?" The thought suggests
   itself, "It is too good to be true." Now, look, Sirs, if it were not
   supremely good it would not be true! It is because it is so excessively
   good that it is true! As one said of God's mercy when his friend was
   astonished at it, "I am astonished, too, but still it is just like He."
   It is just like God, you know, to bless a poor sinner beyond all that
   he can ask or think! It is the way with God to astonish us with His
   Grace. When the Lord sends His mercy it never rains--it pours!

   He deluges the desert. He not only gives enough to moisten, but enough
   to drench the furrows. He makes the wilderness a standing pool of water
   and the thirsty land springs of water! Do not, therefore, doubt the
   genuineness of His mercy because of its greatness. But some timorous
   professors say, "This is a great work which God is doing here, but it
   is too great to last." Yes, that, too, I have heard and the gathering
   of many to hear the Gospel has been sneered at as "a nine days'
   wonder." Alas, our unbelief has said, "It cannot last!" And yet it has
   lasted. The path of faith, to my mind, is very like that of a man
   walking on a tight-rope high up in the air and you always seem half
   afraid that he will fall. Yet if the Lord placed us on a spider's web
   as high as the Alps, He would not let us slip.

   The walk of faith is like going up an invisible staircase. When you
   have climbed and climbed, you sometimes cannot see one single step
   before you. Each step seems to be upon the air and yet when you put
   your foot down it is solid granite, firmer than the earth, itself.
   There are times when Satan whispers, "God will leave you. God will
   forsake you. He has done all this for you and yet He will leave you."
   Ah, but He never will, for His faithfulness never fails! We must not be
   like the countryman who, when he had to cross the river, said that he
   would wait till the stream was dry, for it could not run so fast as
   that long, but must all run away! We have feared that we should live
   till the river of God's mercy has run dry, but it never has and it
   never will!

   Some professors say, when a great number of sinners are converted, "Oh,
   well, you see there are so many they cannot be all genuine." That is
   why I think the work to be real! When I see a little peddling work of
   one, every now and then, I am far more inclined to say, "Well, I do not
   know. It may be of God, but it is not a very great affair and He
   generally does great things when His Spirit is poured out." But when I
   see Him calling 3,000 in one day, I say, "This is the finger of God. I
   am sure of it!" I would be the last to despise the day of small things,
   but I must also speak up for the day of great things! I have noticed
   that those who are added to the Church at times of revival are people
   that hold on quite as well as others and I think better than others.
   That is my experience because at other times we are apt to say, "there
   are so

   few coming forward we must not be quite so strict in examining them."
   But when there is a great number we feel that we can afford to be
   particular and we are naturally more strict.

   I do not justify this, but I am sure that the tendency exists. I
   believe in a great work and when I see our Lord filling the net, I
   think I hear Him saying to me, "Do not be afraid because the fish make
   the boat sink down to the water's edge. Fear not. You shall get many
   more than these. Let down your net again." Let us not doubt because it
   seems too wonderful that God should bless us to a great extent. It is
   wonderful, but let us have no doubt about it! Can the Lord use such
   poor worms as we are? He does use us. Do not ask how He can do it if He
   does it. He is a God of Sovereignty and He uses whom He wills and if He
   blesses you, give Him the glory of it--and do not let the greatness of
   His Grace cause you to mistrust Him!

   You have seen a painter with his palette on his fingers and he has ugly
   little daubs of paint upon the palette. What can he do with those
   spots? Go in and see his picture. What splendid painting! What lights!
   What shades! Where are those daubs of paint? They have been used up
   upon the picture. What? Did he make that beautiful picture out of those
   ugly spots of paint? Yes, that picture was made out of those little
   daubs of color! That is the way with painters. In even a wiser way does
   Jesus act towards us. He takes us, poor smudges of paint, and He makes
   the blessed pictures of His Grace out of us, for it is neither the
   brush He uses, nor the paint He uses, but it is the skill of His own
   hands which does it all and unto His name be the praise!

   Now, poor worker, do not be afraid. The great Artist will take you in
   hand and make something of you. I forget how much can be made out of a
   pennyworth of iron, but I do know that there are methods by which a
   pennyworth of iron can be so molded and worked and fashioned that it
   can become worth a hundred times what it was before it came under the
   manufacturer's hands! What the Lord can make of such poor creatures as
   we are, who shall tell? He says, "Fear not" and I pray you do not fear.
   You who make up the Church in Shoreditch, do not be afraid because the
   Lord fills this great house. Beckon to your partners that are in the
   other ships to come and help you! Help those round about to fill their
   boats and may God send you a long and continued revival of religion in
   this whole region!

   Let not the old folks get frightened at the Lord's glorious
   working--believe in it and rejoice! Why, if the Lord were to convert
   3,000 in one day in any place, there are numbers who would say, "I do
   not believe in it, for I never saw anything like it." Many Churches
   would say, "We do not think that we ought to take them in just yet." At
   Pentecost they baptized the converts the same day! You see, the Church
   was ready to baptize them--we have no Church in England that would do
   that--I fear not one and we have no Christian people who would approve
   of it if it were done. No, they would, as a rule, murmur that it was
   rash enthusiasm and an ill-advised haste. "1 believe in the Holy
   Spirit." We say that, but do we practically believe it? God grant we
   may!

   IV. But now I turn to a fourth, "Fear not," which we find in the 10th
   chapter of Matthew, the 28th verse. I will not turn to it, but I will
   just tell you of it because there are many of you here who need its
   comfort. "Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill
   the soul: but rather fear Him which is able to destroy both soul and
   body in Hell." THIS IS MEANT TO REMOVE THE FEAR ARISING OUT OF SHARP
   PERSECUTION. In a region like this, when a working man is converted to
   Jesus Christ, his friends and his neighbors soon find it out and, I am
   sorry to say, that working men, as a rule, do not treat Christian men
   fairly. They used to say in America, "It is a free country. Every man
   may whip his own slave," and so it is here. It is a free country. Every
   man may swear at his fellow workman for worshipping

   God.

   It is a fearful piece of meanness that men should molest their fellows
   for being godly. If you have a right to swear, I have a right to sing
   Psalms! And if you have a right to break the Sabbath, I have a right to
   keep it and I have a right to go in and out of the workshop without
   being called bad names because I live in the fear of God. But the right
   is not always recognized. Some have to run the gauntlet from morning to
   night because they serve the Lord. Now, my dear Brothers and Sisters in
   Christ, do not be afraid though you are nothing but poor sheep and you
   are sent out into the midst of wolves. Does it not seem as if our Lord
   could hardly have known what He was doing when He said, "Behold, I send
   you forth as sheep among wolves"?

   Yet He made no mistake. Just think for a minute--how many wolves are
   there in the world now? They have been eating up the sheep ever since
   they had a chance, but are there more wolves or more sheep alive at
   this day? Why, the wolves get fewer and fewer every day, till when a
   wolf comes down into the inhabited lands in France, we have it reported

   in the paper and we have not one wild animal of the kind in this
   country, though they used to abound here! The fact is, the sheep have
   driven out the wolves! It looked as if they would eat the sheep up, but
   the sheep have exterminated them. So it will be in the end with
   defenseless Believers and raging persecutors--patient weakness will
   overcome passionate strength! Only be patient.

   You have an anvil in the shop and you know how hard the hammer comes
   down on it. What does the anvil do? Why, bears it. You never saw the
   anvil get up and fight the hammer. Never! It stands still and takes the
   blows. Down comes the hammer. But now listen. How many hammers have
   been worn out to one anvil? Where it has stood for years, the old block
   of iron remains, ready to bear more strokes. The hammers will break,
   but not the anvil! Be an anvil, Brother. Still be the sheep, Brothers
   and Sisters, for heavenly submission shall win the victory and patient
   non-resistance shall come off more than a conqueror! Do not fear, I
   pray you, so as to conceal your testimony! Tell all what Jesus Christ
   has done for you and the more they blaspheme and persecute you, be you
   the more determined, by God's Grace, that they shall not be able to
   find fault in your character and that they shall know that you are a
   Christian!

   Climb up the mast and nail the colors to it! Drive another nail
   tonight. Fix the colors to the masthead. Say, "No, never, by God's
   Grace, will I be ashamed of being a Christian! I might be ashamed if I
   were a drunk. I might be ashamed if I were a swearer. But I will never
   be ashamed that I am a follower of the crucified Son of God." O poor
   men and women, who have, for the most part, to bear the brunt of the
   world's assaults, God grant that you may not fear! Do not fall into
   doubt about your religion, either. Do not be so afraid as to fall into
   questioning and unbelief. True religion never was in the majority and
   never will be for many a year to come. You may rest assured that if we
   were to poll the world for any opinion and if that opinion should be
   decided by a majority, it would be necessarily wrong.

   Now and then, in one country, the right prevails, but all the world
   over the seed of the serpent outnumber the seed of the woman. Blessed
   is he who can stand in a minority of one with God, for a minority of
   one for God is, in the judgment of the Truth of God, a majority! Count
   God with you and you have more with you than all they that are against
   you!

   V. I must not keep you much longer, for the heat grows great and I fear
   some of you are fainting. Therefore I want to say another word which I
   should like you all to hear. This is the fifth, "Fear not." You will
   find it in Luke 12:32. Christ preaching to His disciples said--"Fear
   not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you
   the kingdom."

   THIS IS MEANT TO PREVENT FEAR AS TO TEMPORAL THINGS. Now, I know that
   this is a time in which many

   of God's people are much tried and they tremble lest they should not be
   provided for. Listen to this--Did you escape from poverty by being
   frightened about it? Did your fears ever make you any richer? Have you
   not found it to be vain to rise up early and to sit up late and to eat
   the bread of carefulness when you have had no faith in God? Have you
   not learned that?

   And do you not know that if you are a child of God He will certainly
   give you your food and raiment? Ah, I hear a heavy sigh from one--"It
   has been a hard winter." It is true, my Friend, it has been a hard
   winter. I dare say that the birds have found it so and yet on Sunday
   morning I noticed, when I opened my window early, that they were
   singing very sweetly. And this morning, too, they broke forth in a
   chorus of harmonious song. You know what the little bird sings when he
   sits on a bare branch with the snow all around him? He chirps out--

   "Mortal, cease from toilandsorrow, God provides for the morrow."

   Learn the sparrow's song and try, if you can, to catch the spirit of
   the bird which has no barn or storehouse and yet is fed! There is this
   to comfort you--"Your heavenly Father knows what things you have need
   of." He understands your needs. Is it not enough for a child that his
   father knows his needs? Rest in that and be confident that verily you
   shall be

   fed.

   You will not have much in this world, perhaps, but you shall have the
   kingdom of God! Be of good cheer about that. Your inheritance is yet to
   come--you shall have the kingdom! You have even now a reversionary
   interest in Eternal Glory and this involves present supplies! He who
   promises the end will provide for the way. Some of the Lord's best
   people are those that have to suffer most, but it is because they can
   glorify Him here most by suffering. I think the angels in Heaven must
   almost envy a child of God who has the power and the privilege to
   suffer for Christ's sake, for doubtless angels render perfect service
   to the heavenly King, yet not by suffering. Theirs is active and not
   passive obedience to the will of God! I think they will cluster round
   some of you in Heaven and say, "You lived down at Bethnal Green, or

   Shoreditch. Ah, yes," the angels will say, "What sort of a place did
   you live in? One dark room? You were very poor. You were out of work
   and did you trust God?"

   The angels will be pleased as you tell them, "Oh yes, we still went to
   the heavenly Father and we said, 'Though He slay me, yet will I trust
   in Him."' That is the grandest thing that a man ever did say! At least,
   I think it is. Mr. Cuff says some fine things, but he never uttered a
   nobler sentence than that--"Though He slay me, yet will I trust in
   Him." The expression is sublime! When Job had lost everything, after
   being immensely rich, he sat on a dunghill and scraped his sores and he
   said, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return
   there." He was reduced to the most abject need and yet he added--"The
   Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the
   Lord." You cherubim and seraphim, in all your songs, no stanza excels
   that heroic verse! Angels cannot rise to such a height of sublime
   devotion to the Invisible One as Job did when, in his misery, he
   glorified his God by abiding confidence.

   Oh, you that are brought very low, you have grand opportunities for
   honoring God if you will but trust Him. "Fear not." "Fear not."--

   "Fear not the loss of outward good, He will for His provide.

   Give them supplies of daily food, And all they need beside."

   And He will give you spiritual food, too. When God saves His people He
   gives them spiritual food to live upon till they get to Heaven. God
   does not give us treatment like that which the Duke of Alva measured
   out to a city which had surrendered. He agreed to give the inhabitants
   their lives, but when they complained that they were dying of hunger,
   he maliciously replied, "I granted you your lives, but I did not
   promise you food." Our God does not talk so. He includes in the promise
   of salvation all that goes with it--and you shall have all you really
   need between here and Heaven! Fear not!

   VI. Lastly, time fails me, but I was going to close with that word in
   the 27th of Acts, the 24th verse, where the Lord sent His angel to His
   servant Paul in the time of the shipwreck and said to him, "Fear not,
   Paul; you must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God has given you all
   them that sail with you." So I pray God that all perils in the
   future--all imminent ills and dangers which surround you now--may not
   cause you to fear, for the Lord will not suffer a hair of your head to
   perish! He that has made you will bear you through and make you more
   than conquerors! Tried people of God, rest in the Lord and your
   confidence shall be your strength!

   You have often heard of the boy on board ship in time of storm who was
   the only person that was not afraid. When they asked him why he did not
   fear, he said, "Because my father is at the helm." We have still better
   cause for casting away all fear, for not only is our Father at the helm
   but our Father is everywhere! He is holding the winds and the waves in
   the hollow of His hand! No trouble can happen to you or to me but what
   He ordains or permits. No trial can come but what He will restrain and
   overrule. No evil can happen but what shall certainly work for good to
   them that love God! Therefore be not afraid.

   Though the howling tempest yell and the ship creak and groan as she
   labors among the waves and you think that nothing but destruction
   awaits you, fear not! Let not fear linger for a single moment in the
   Presence of the eternal Christ who says, "It is I. Be not afraid." May
   God grant that His own, "Fear not," may go home to the heart of
   everyone here present in some form or other--and unto His name be
   Glory, world without end. Amen!

Salvation By Works, A Criminal Doctrine

   (No. 1534)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 18, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I do not frustrate the Grace of God: for if righteousness comes by the
   Law, then Christ is dead in vain." Galatians 2:21.

   THE idea of salvation by the merit of our own works is exceedingly
   insinuating. It matters not how often it is refuted, it asserts itself
   again and again and when it gains the least foothold it soon makes
   great advances. Hence Paul, who was determined to show it no quarter,
   opposed everything which bore its likeness. He was determined not to
   permit the thin end of the wedge to be introduced into the Church, for
   well he knew that willing hands would soon be driving it home!
   Therefore when Peter sided with the Judaizing party and seemed to favor
   those who demanded that the Gentiles should be circumcised, our brave
   Apostle withstood him to his face. He always fought for salvation by
   Grace through faith and contended strenuously against all thought of
   righteousness by obedience to the precepts of the ceremonial or the
   moral Law.

   No one could be more explicit than he upon the doctrine that we are not
   justified or saved by works in any degree, but solely by the Grace of
   God. His trumpet gave forth no uncertain sound, but gave forth the
   clear note--"By Grace are you saved through faith; and that not of
   yourselves: it is the gift of God." Grace meant Grace with Paul and he
   could not endure any tampering with the matter, or any frittering away
   of its meaning. So fascinating is the doctrine of legal righteousness
   that the only way to deal with it is Paul's way--stamp it out! Cry war
   to the knife against it! Never yield to it! And remember the Apostle's
   firmness and how stoutly he held his ground--"To whom," he says, "we
   gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour."

   The error of salvation by works is exceedingly plausible. You will
   constantly hear it stated as a self-evident truth and vindicated on
   account of its supposed practical usefulness, while the Gospel doctrine
   of Salvation by Faith is railed at and accused of evil consequences. It
   is affirmed that if we preach salvation by good works we shall
   encourage virtue--and so it might seem in theory--but history proves,
   by many instances, that as a matter of fact where such doctrine has
   been preached virtue has become singularly uncommon and that in
   proportion as the merit of works has been cried up, morality has gone
   down!

   On the other hand, where Justification by Faith has been preached,
   conversions have followed and purity of life has been produced even in
   the worst of men. Those who lead godly and gracious lives are ready to
   confess that the cause of their zeal for holiness lies in their faith
   in Christ Jesus. Where will you meet with a devout and upright man who
   glories in his own works? Self-righteousness is natural to our fallen
   humanity and, therefore, it is the essence of all false religions. Be
   they what they may, they all agree in seeking salvation by our own
   deeds. He who worships his idols will torture his body, will fast, will
   perform long pilgrimages and do or endure anything in order to merit
   salvation! The Roman Catholic church holds up continually before the
   eyes of its votaries the prize to be earned by self-denial, by penance,
   by prayers, by sacraments or by some other performances of man. Go
   where you may, the natural religion of fallen man is salvation by his
   own merits.

   An old Divine has well said every man is born a heretic upon this point
   and he naturally gravitates towards this heresy in one form or another.
   Self-salvation, either by his personal worthiness, by his repentance or
   by his resolves is a hope ingrained in human nature and very hard to
   remove. This foolishness is bound up in the heart of every child and
   who shall get it out of him? This erroneous idea arises partly from
   ignorance, for men are ignorant of the Law of God and of what holiness
   really is. If they knew that even an evil thought is a breach of the
   Law and that the Law once broken in any point is altogether violated,
   they would be at once convinced that there can be no righteousness by
   the Law to those who have already offended against it.

   They are also in great ignorance concerning themselves, for those very
   persons who talk about self-righteousness are, as a rule, openly
   chargeable with fault. And if not, were they to sit down and really
   look at their own lives, they would soon perceive, even in their best
   works, such impurity of motive beforehand, or such pride and
   self-congratulation afterwards, that they would see the gloss taken off
   from all their performances and they would be utterly ashamed of them!
   Nor is it only ignorance which leads men to self-righteousness--they
   are also deceived by pride. Man cannot endure to be saved on the
   footing of mercy--he hates to plead guilty and throw himself on the
   favor of the great King--he cannot stand to be treated as a pauper and
   blessed as a matter of charity!

   He desires to have a finger in his own salvation and claim at least a
   little credit for it. Proud man will not have Heaven, itself, upon
   terms of Grace! As long as he can, he sets up one plea or another and
   holds to his own righteousness as though it were his life. This
   self-confidence also arises from wicked unbelief, for through his
   self-conceit, man will not believe God. Nothing is more plainly
   revealed in Scripture than this--that by the works of the Law shall no
   man be jus-tified--yet men, in some shape or other, stick to the hope
   of legal righteousness! They will have it that they must prepare for
   Grace, or assist mercy, or in some degree deserve eternal life. They
   prefer their own flattering prejudices to the declaration of the
   heart-searching God! The Testimony of the Holy Spirit concerning the
   deceitfulness of the heart is cast aside and the declaration of God
   that there is none that does good, no, not one, is altogether denied.
   Is not this a great evil?

   Self-righteousness is also much promoted by the almost universal spirit
   of trifling which is now abroad. Only while men trifle with themselves
   can they entertain the idea of personal merit before God. He who comes
   to serious thought and begins to understand the Character of God,
   before whom the heavens are not pure and the angels are charged with
   folly--he, I say, that comes to serious thought and beholds a true
   vision of God, abhors himself in dust and ashes and is forever silenced
   as to any thought of self-justification! It is because we do not
   seriously examine our condition that we think ourselves rich and
   increased in goods. A man may fancy that he is prospering in business
   and yet he may be going back in the world. If he does not face his
   books or take stock, he may be living in a fool's paradise, spending
   largely when on the verge of bankruptcy.

   Many think well of themselves because they never think seriously. They
   do not look below the surface and, therefore, they are deceived by
   appearances. The most troublesome business to many men is thought--and
   the last thing they will do is to weigh their actions, or test their
   motives, or ponder their ways to see whether things are right with
   them. Self-righteousness, being supported by ignorance, by pride, by
   unbelief and by the natural superficiality of the human mind, is
   strongly entrenched and cannot readily be driven out of men.
   Self-righteousness is evidently evil, for it makes light of sin! It
   talks of merit in the case of one who has already transgressed and
   boasts of excellence in reference to a fallen and depraved creature. It
   prattles of little faults, small failures and slight omissions and so
   makes sin to be a venial error which may be readily overlooked. Not so
   faith in God, for though it recognizes pardon, yet that pardon is seen
   to come in a way which proves sin to be exceedingly sinful.

   On the other hand, the doctrine of salvation by works has not a word of
   comfort in it for the fallen. It gives to the elder son all that his
   proud heart can claim, but for the prodigal it has no welcome. The Law
   has no invitation for the sinner, for it knows nothing of mercy. If
   salvation is by the works of the Law, what must become of the guilty
   and the fallen and the abandoned? By what hopes can these be recalled?
   This unmerciful doctrine bars the door of hope and hands over the lost
   ones to the executioner in order that the proud Pharisee may air his
   boastful righteousness and thank God that he is not as other men are!

   It is the intense selfishness of this doctrine which condemns it as an
   evil thing. It naturally exalts self. If a man conceives that he will
   be saved by his own works, he thinks himself something and glories in
   the dignity of human nature! When he has been attentive to religious
   exercises he rubs his hands and feels that he deserves well of his
   Maker--he goes home to repeat his prayers and before he falls asleep he
   wonders how he can have grown to be so good and so much superior to
   those around him. When he walks abroad he feels as if he dwelt apart in
   native excellence, a person much distinguished from "the vulgar herd,"
   a being whom to know is to admire. All the while he considers himself
   to be very humble and is often amazed at his own condescension.

   What is this but a most hateful spirit? God, who sees the heart,
   loathes it! He will accept the humble and the contrite, but He puts far
   from Him those who glory in themselves. Indeed, my Brothers and
   Sisters, what have we to glory in? Is not every boast a lie? What is
   this self-hood but a peacock feather, fit only for the cap of a fool?
   May God deliver us

   from exalting self! And yet, we cannot be delivered from so doing if we
   hold, in any degree, the doctrine of salvation by our own good works.
   At this time I desire to shoot at the very heart of that
   soul-destroying doctrine, while I show you, in the first place, that
   two great crimes are contained in the idea of self-justification. When
   I have brought forth that indictment, I shall further endeavor to show
   that these two great crimes are committed by many and then, thirdly, it
   will be a delight to assert that the true Believer does not fall into
   these crimes. May God, the Holy Spirit, help us while meditating upon
   this important theme.

   I. First, then, TWO GREAT CRIMES ARE CONTAINED IN SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS.
   These high crimes and misdemeanors are frustrating the Grace of God and
   making Christ to have died in vain. The first is the frustration of the
   Grace of God. The word here translated, "frustrate," means to make
   void, to reject, to refuse, to regard as needless. Now, he that hopes
   to be saved by his own righteousness rejects the Grace, or free favor,
   of God! He regards it as useless and in that sense frustrates it. It is
   clear, first, that if righteousness comes by the Law, the Grace of God
   is no longer required. If we can be saved by our own merits, we need
   justice, but we certainly do not need mercy.

   If we can keep the Law and claim to be accepted as a matter of debt, it
   is plain that we need not turn suppliants and crave for mercy. Grace is
   a superfluity where merit can be proven. A man who can go into court
   with a clear case and a bold countenance asks not for mercy of the
   judge and the offer of it would insult him. "Give me justice," he says!
   "Give me my rights" and he stands up for them as a brave Englishman
   should do. It is only when a man feels that the law condemns him that
   he puts in a plea for mercy. Nobody ever dreamed of recommending an
   innocent man to mercy. I say, then, that the man who believes that by
   keeping the Law, or by practicing ceremonies, or by undergoing
   religious performances he can make himself acceptable before God, most
   decidedly puts the Grace of God on one side as a superfluous thing as
   far as he is concerned! Is it not clearly so? And is not this a crimson
   crime--this frustration of the Grace of God?

   Next, he makes the Grace of God to be at least a secondary thing which
   is only a lower degree of the same error. Many think that they are to
   merit as much as they can by their own exertions and then the Grace of
   God will make up for the rest. The theory is that we are to keep the
   Law as far as we can and this imperfect obedience is to stand good--as
   a sort of compromise--say a shilling in the pound, or fifteen shillings
   in the pound--according as man judges his own excellence. And then,
   what is required over and above our own hard-earned money, the Grace of
   God will supply--in short, the plan is every man is his own savior and
   Jesus Christ and His Grace just make up for our deficiencies.

   Whether men see it or not, this mixture of Law and Grace is most
   dishonoring to the salvation of Jesus Christ. It makes the Savior's
   work to be incomplete, though on the Cross He cried, "It is finished."
   Yes, it even treats it as being utterly ineffectual since it appears to
   be of no use at all until man's works are added to it. According to
   this notion, we are redeemed as much by our own doing as by the ransom
   price of Jesus' blood--man and Christ go shares, both in the work and
   in the glory! This is an intense form of arrogant treason against the
   majesty of Divine Mercy! This is a capital crime which will condemn all
   who continue in it. May God deliver us from thus insulting the Throne
   of Grace by bringing a purchase price in our own hands as if we could
   deserve such peerless gifts of love!

   More than that, he who trusts in himself, his feelings, his works, his
   prayers, or in anything except the Grace of God virtually gives up
   trusting in the Grace of God altogether! Don't you know that God's
   Grace will never share the work with man's merit? As oil will not
   combine with water, so neither will human merit and heavenly mercy mix
   together! The Apostle says in Romans 11:6, "If by Grace, then it is no
   more of works: otherwise Grace is no more Grace. But if it is of works,
   then is it no more Grace: otherwise work is no more work." You must
   either have salvation wholly because you deserve it, or wholly because
   God graciously bestows it, though you do not deserve it! You must
   receive salvation at the Lord's hands either as a debt or as a
   charity--there can be no mingling of the ideas. That which is a pure
   gift of favor cannot also be a reward of personal merit! A combination
   of the two principles of Law and Grace is utterly impossible. Trusting
   in our own works in any degree effectually shuts us out from all hope
   of salvation by Grace--and so it frustrates the Grace of God.

   There is another form of this crime, that when men preach up human
   works, sufferings, feelings, or emotions as the ground of salvation,
   they deny the sinner confidence in Christ, for as long as a man can
   maintain any hope in himself, he will never look to the Redeemer. We
   may preach forever and ever, but as long as there remains latent in any
   one bosom a hope that he can effectually clear himself from sin and win
   the favor of God by his own works, that man will never accept the
   proclamation of free pardon through the blood of Christ! We know that
   we cannot frustrate the Grace of God--it

   will have its way and the eternal purpose shall be fulfilled. But as
   the tendency of all teaching which mixes up works with Grace is to take
   men away from believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, its tendency is to
   frustrate the Grace of God and every act is to be judged by its
   tendency even if the Lord's Divine power prevents its working out its
   natural result.

   No man can lay another Foundation than that which is laid, but inasmuch
   as they try to do so they are guilty of despising the Foundation of God
   as much as those builders of the olden times who rejected the stone
   which God had chosen to be the head of the corner. May the Grace of God
   keep us from such a crime as this, lest the blood of other men's souls
   should crimson our garments. This hoping to be saved by our own
   righteousness robs God of His Glory. It as good as says, "We do not
   need Grace. We need no free favor." It reads of the New Covenant, which
   Infinite Love has made, but by clinging to the Old Covenant it puts
   dishonor upon it. In its heart it murmurs, "What need of this Covenant
   of Grace? The Covenant of Works answers every purpose for us."

   It reads of the great gift of Grace in the Person of Jesus Christ and
   it does despite thereto by the secret thought that human works are as
   good as the life and death of the Son of God! It cries, "We will not
   have this Man to save us." A self-righteous hope casts a slur upon the
   Glory of God since it is clear that if a man could be saved by his own
   works, he would naturally have the honor of it. But if a man is saved
   by the free Grace of God, then God is glorified. Woe unto those who
   teach a doctrine which would pluck the royal Crown from the head of our
   Sovereign Lord and disgrace the Throne of His glory! God help us to be
   clear of this rank offense against high Heaven. I grow warm upon such a
   subject as this, for my indignation rises against that which does
   dishonor to my Lord and frustrates His Grace.

   This is a sin so gross that even the heathen cannot commit it! They
   have never heard of the Grace of God and therefore they cannot put a
   slight upon it--when they perish it will be with a far lighter doom
   than those who have been told that God is gracious and ready to pardon
   and yet turn on their heels and wickedly boast of innocence and pretend
   to be clean in the sight of God! This is a sin which devils cannot
   commit. With all the obstinacy of their rebellion, they can never reach
   to this! They have never had the sweet notes of Free Grace and dying
   love ringing in their ears and, therefore, they have never refused the
   heavenly invitation. What has never been presented to their acceptance
   cannot be the object of their rejection. Thus, my Hearer, if you should
   fall into this deep ditch, you will sink lower than the heathen, lower
   than Sodom and Gomorrah and lower than the devil, himself! Wake up, I
   pray, and do not dare to frustrate the Grace of God!

   The second great crime which self-justification commits is making
   Christ to be dead in vain. This is plain enough. If salvation can be by
   the works of the Law, why did our Lord Jesus die to save us? O, You
   bleeding Lamb of God, Your Incarnation is a marvel, but Your death upon
   the accursed tree is such a miracle of mercy as fills all Heaven with
   astonishment! Will any dare to say that Your death, O Incarnate God,
   was a superfluity, a wanton waste of suffering? Do they dare think You
   a generous but unwise enthusiast whose death was needless? Can there be
   any who think Your Cross a vain thing? Yes, thousands virtually do this
   and, in fact, all do who make it out that men might have been saved in
   some other way, or may now be saved by their own works and doings! They
   who say that the death of Christ goes only part of the way and that man
   must do something in order to merit eternal life--these, I say, make
   this death of Christ to be only partially effective and, in yet clearer
   terms, ineffectual in and of itself!

   If it is even hinted that the blood of Jesus is not price enough till
   man adds his silver or his gold, then His blood is not our redemption
   at all and Christ is no Redeemer! If it is taught that our Lord's
   bearing of sin for us did not make a perfect Atonement and that it is
   ineffectual till we either do or suffer something to complete it--then
   in the supplemental work lies the real virtue and Christ's work, is in
   itself, insufficient! His death cry of, "It is finished," must have
   been all a mistake if it is still not finished! And if a believer in
   Christ is not completely saved by what Christ has done, but must do
   something, himself, to complete it, then salvation was not finished and
   the Savior's work remains imperfect till we, poor sinners, lend a hand
   to make up for His deficiencies! What blasphemy lies in such a
   supposition that Christ, on Calvary, made a needless and a useless
   offering of Himself and any man among you can be saved by the works of
   the Law!

   This spirit also rejects the Covenant which was sealed with Christ's
   death. For if we can be saved by the old Covenant of Works, then the
   New Covenant was not required. In God's wisdom the New Covenant was
   brought in because the first had grown old and was void by
   transgression. But if it is not void, then the New Covenant is an idle
   innovation and the Sacrifice of Jesus ratified a foolish transaction! I
   loathe the words while I pronounce them! No one ever was saved under
   the Covenant of Works nor ever will be--the New Covenant is introduced
   for that reason--but if there is salvation by

   the first, then what need was there of the second? Self-righteousness,
   as far as it can, disannuls the Covenant, breaks its seal and does
   despite to the blood of Jesus Christ which is the substance, the
   certificate and the seal of that Covenant.

   If you hold that a man can be saved by his own good works, you pour
   contempt upon the Testament of Love which the death of Jesus has put in
   force, for there is no need to receive as a legacy of love that which
   can be earned as the wage of work! O Sirs, this is a sin against each
   Person of the sacred Trinity! It is a sin against the Father. How could
   He be wise and good and yet give His only Son to die on yonder tree in
   anguish if man's salvation could be worked by some other means? It is a
   sin against the Son of God--you dare to say that our redemption price
   could have been paid another way and, therefore, His death was not
   absolutely necessary for the redemption of the world. Or, if necessary,
   yet not effectual, for it requires something to be added to it before
   it can effect its purpose.

   It is a sin against the Holy Spirit and beware how you sin against Him,
   for such sins are fatal! The Holy Spirit bears witness to the glorious
   perfection and unconquerable power of the Redeemer's work and woe to
   those who reject that witness! He has come into the world, on purpose,
   that He may convict men of the sin of not believing in Jesus Christ
   and, therefore, if we think that we can be saved apart from Christ we
   do despite to the Spirit of His Grace. The doctrine of salvation by
   works is a sin against all the fallen sons of Adam, for if men cannot
   be saved except by their own works, what hope is left for any
   transgressor? You shut the gates of Mercy on mankind! You condemn the
   guilty to die without the possibility of remission! You deny all hope
   of welcome to the returning prodigal, all prospect of Paradise to the
   dying thief! If Heaven is by works, thousands of us will never see its
   gates. I know that I never shall. You fine fellows may rejoice in your
   prospects, but what is to become of us? You ruin us all by your
   boastful scheme!

   Nor is this all. It is a sin against the saints, for none of them have
   any other hope except in the blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ.
   Remove the doctrine of the atoning blood and you have taken all away!
   Our foundation is gone! If you speak thus you offend the whole
   generation of godly men. I go further--work-mongering is a sin against
   the perfect ones above! The doctrine of salvation by works would
   silence the hallelujahs of Heaven. Hush, you choristers, what meaning
   is there in your song? You are chanting, "Unto Him that loved us and
   washed us from our sins in His own blood." But why do you sing so? If
   salvation is by works, your ascriptions of praise are empty flatteries.
   You ought to sing, "Unto ourselves who kept our garments clean, to us
   be glory forever and ever!" Or at least, "unto ourselves whose acts
   made the Redeemer's work effectual be a full share of praise."

   But a self-lauding note was never heard in Heaven and, therefore, we
   feel sure that the doctrine of self-justification is not of God. I
   charge you--renounce it as the foe of God and man! This proud system is
   a sin of deepest dye against my Master, Jesus Christ! I cannot endure
   to think of the insult which it puts upon our dying Lord! If you have
   made Christ to live in vain, that is bad enough, but to represent Him
   as having died in vain? What shall be said of this? That Christ came to
   earth for nothing is a most horrible statement, but that He became
   obedient to the death of the Cross without result is profanity at its
   worst!

   II. I will say no more concerning the nature of these sins, but in the
   second place proceed to the solemn fact that THESE TWO GREAT CRIMES ARE
   COMMITTED BY MANY PEOPLE. I am afraid they are committed by some who
   hear me this day. Let everyone search himself and see if these accursed
   things are not hidden in his heart and if they are, let him cry unto
   God for deliverance from them! Assuredly these crimes are chargeable on
   those who trifle with the Gospel! Here is the greatest discovery that
   was ever made--the most wonderful piece of knowledge that ever was
   revealed and yet you do not think it worth a thought! You come now and
   then to hear a sermon, but you hear without heart. You read the
   Scriptures occasionally, but you do not search them as for hidden
   treasure.

   It is not your first objective in life to thoroughly understand and
   heartily to receive the Gospel which God has proclaimed--yet such ought
   to be the case. What, my Friend? Does your indifference say that the
   Grace of God is of no great value in your esteem? You do not think it
   worth the trouble of prayer, of Bible-reading and attention? The death
   of Christ is nothing to you--a very beautiful fact, no doubt--you know
   the story well, but you do not care enough about it to wish to be a
   partaker in its benefits? His blood may have power to cleanse from sin,
   but you do not need remission? His death may be the life of men, but
   you do not long to live by Him? To be saved by the atoning blood does
   not strike you as being half as important as to carry on your business
   at a profit and acquire a fortune for your family? By thus trifling
   with these precious things, you do, as far as you can, frustrate the
   Grace of God and make Christ to die in vain!

   Another set of people who do this are those who have no sense of guilt.
   Perhaps they are naturally amiable, civil, honest and generous people
   and they think that these natural virtues are all that is needed. We
   have many such in whom there is much that is lovely, but the one thing
   necessary is lacking--they are not conscious that they ever did
   anything very wrong! They think themselves certainly as good as others
   and in some respects rather better. It is highly probable that you are
   as good as others and even better than others, but still, do you not
   see, my dear Friend, if I am addressing one such person, that if you
   are so good that you are to be saved by your goodness, you put the
   Grace of God out of court and make it vain? The whole have no need of
   the Physician--only they that are sick require His skill and,
   therefore, it was needless that Christ should die for such as you
   because you, in your own opinion, have done nothing worthy of death.

   You claim that you have done nothing very bad and yet there is one
   thing in which you have grievously transgressed and I beg you not to be
   angry when I charge you with it. You are very bad because you are so
   proud as to think yourself righteous, though God has said that there is
   none righteous, no, not one! You tell your God that He is a liar! His
   Word accuses you and His Law condemns you but you will not believe Him
   and actually boast of having a righteousness of your own! This is high
   presumption and arrogant pride and may the Lord purge you from it! Will
   you lay this to heart and remember that if you have never been guilty
   of anything else, this is sin enough to make you mourn before the Lord
   day and night? You have, as far as you could, by your proud opinion of
   yourself made void the Grace of God and declared that Christ died in
   vain. Hide your face for shame and entreat for mercy for this glaring
   offense!

   Another sort of people may fancy that they shall escape but we must now
   come home to them. Those who despair will often cry, "I know I cannot
   be saved except by Grace, for I am such a great sinner! But, alas, I am
   too great a sinner to be saved at all! I am too black for Christ to
   wash out my sins." Ah, my dear Friend, though you know it not, you are
   making void the Grace of God by denying its power and limiting its
   might! You doubt the efficacy of the Redeemer's blood and the power of
   the Father's Grace. What? The Grace of God not able to save? Is not the
   Father of our Lord Jesus able to forgive sin? We joyfully sing--

   "Who is a pardoning Godlike Thee? Or who has Grace so rich and free?"
   And you dare say He cannot forgive you and this in the teeth of His
   many promises of mercy? He says, "All manner of sin and of blasphemy
   shall be forgiven unto men." "Come now and let us reason together, says
   the Lord: though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as
   snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool."

   You say that this is not true! Thus you frustrate the Grace of God and
   you make out that Christ died in vain, at least for you, for you say
   that He cannot cleanse you. Oh do not say this! Let not your unbelief
   give the lie to God. Oh, believe that He is able to save even you and
   freely, at this very moment, and put all your sin away and to accept
   you in Christ Jesus! Take heed of despondency, for if you do not trust
   Him, you will make void His Grace. And those, I think, commit this sin
   in a large measure, who make a mingle-mangle of the Gospel. I mean
   this--when we preach the Gospel we have only to say, "Sinners, you are
   guilty! You never can be anything else but guilty in and of
   yourselves--if that sin of yours is pardoned, it must be through an act
   of Sovereign Grace and not because of anything in you, or that can be
   done by you. Grace must be given to you because Jesus died and for no
   other reason and the way by which you can have that Grace is simply by
   trusting Christ. By faith in Jesus Christ you shall obtain full
   forgiveness." This is pure Gospel.

   If the man turns round and enquires, "Why do I have a right to believe
   in Christ?" If I tell him that he is warranted to believe in Christ
   because he feels a law-work within, or because he has holy desires, I
   have made a mess of it--I have put something of the man into the
   question and marred the glory of Grace. My answer is, "Man, your right
   to believe in Christ lies not in what you are or feel, but in God's
   command to you to believe and in God's promise which is made to every
   creature under Heaven that whoever believes in Jesus Christ shall be
   saved." This is our commission, "Go you into all the world and preach
   the Gospel to every creature. He that believes and is baptized shall be
   saved."

   If you are a creature, we preach that Gospel to you! Trust Christ and
   you are saved. Not because you are a sensible sinner, or a penitent
   sinner, or anything else, but simply because God, of His Free Grace,
   with no consideration rendered to Him on your part, but gratis and for
   nothing, freely forgives all your debts for the sake of Jesus Christ.
   Now I have not mangled the Gospel--there it is with nothing of the
   creature about it but the man's faith and even that is the Holy

   Spirit's gift! Those who mingle their, "ifs," and, "buts," and insist
   upon, "you must do this and feel that before you may accept Christ,"
   frustrate the Grace of God, in a measure, and do damage to the glorious
   Gospel of the blessed God.

   And so, once more, to those who apostatize. Do I speak to any here who
   were once professors of religion--who once used to offer prayer in the
   assembly--who once walked as saints but now have gone back, breaking
   the Sabbath, forsaking the house of God and living in sin? You, my
   Friend, say by your course of life--"I had the Grace of God, but I do
   not care about it! It is worth nothing. I have rejected it, I have
   given it up! I have made it void! I have gone back to the world." You
   do as good as say, "I did once trust in Jesus Christ, but He is not
   worth trusting."

   You have denied Him--you have sold your Lord and Master! I will not now
   go into the question as to whether you ever were sincere, though I
   believe you never were. But on your own showing such is your case. Take
   heed lest these two terrible crimes should rest upon you--that you do
   frustrate the Grace of God and make Christ to be dead in vain.

   III. On my third point I shall carry with me the deep convictions and
   the joyful confidences of all true Believers. It is

   this, that NO TRUE BELIEVER WILL BE GUILTY OF THESE CRIMES. In his very
   soul he loathes these infamous

   sins. First of all, no believer in Christ can bear to think of
   frustrating of the Grace of God or the making it void. Come, now,
   honest hearts, I speak to you! Do you trust in Grace alone, or do you,
   in some measure, rest in yourselves? Do you, even in a small degree,
   depend upon your own feelings, your own faithfulness, your own
   repentance? I know you abhor the very thought! You have not even the
   shadow of a hope nor the semblance of a confidence in anything you ever
   were, or ever can be, or ever hope to be! You fling this away as a foul
   rag full of filth which you would hurl out of the universe if you
   could.

   I acknowledge that though I have preached the Gospel with all my heart
   and glory in it, yet I cast my preaching away as dross and dung if I
   think of them as a ground of reliance! And though I have brought many
   souls to Christ, blessed be His name, I never dare, for one moment, to
   put the slightest confidence in that fact as to my own salvation, for I
   know that I, after having preached to others, may yet be a castaway. I
   cannot rest in a successful ministry, or an edified Church, but I
   repose alone in my Redeemer! What I say of myself I know that each one
   of you will say for himself. Your almsgivings, your prayers, your
   tears, your suffering persecution, your gifts to the Church, your
   earnest work in the Sunday school or elsewhere--did you ever think of
   putting these side by side with the blood of Christ as your hope?

   No, you never dreamed of it! I am sure you never did and the mention of
   it is utterly loathsome to you, is it not? Grace, Grace, Grace is your
   only hope. Moreover, you have not only renounced all confidence in
   works, but you renounce it this day more heartily than ever before. The
   older you are and the more holy you become, the less do you think of
   trusting in yourself! The more we grow in Grace the more we grow in
   love with Grace--the more we search into our hearts and the more we
   know of the holy Law of God, the deeper is our sense of unworthiness
   and consequently the higher is our delight in rich, free, unmerited
   mercy--the free gift of the royal heart of God!

   Tell me, does not your heart leap within you when you hear the
   Doctrines of Grace? I know there are some who never felt themselves to
   be sinners, who shift about as if they were sitting on thorns when I am
   preaching Grace and nothing else but Grace--but it is not so with you
   who are resting in Christ. "Oh, no," you say, "ring that bell again,
   Sir! Ring that bell again! There is no music like it. Touch that string
   again, it is our favorite note!" When you get down in spirits and
   depressed, what sort of book do you like to read? Is it not a Book
   about the Grace of God? What do you turn to in the Scriptures? Do you
   not turn to the promises made to the guilty, the ungodly, the sinner?
   And do you not find that only in the Grace of God and only at the foot
   of the Cross is there any rest for you? I know it is so! Then you can
   rise up and say with Paul, "I do not frustrate the Grace of God. Some
   may, if they like, but God forbid that I should ever make it void, for
   it is all my salvation and all my desire."

   The true Believer is also free from the second crime--he does not make
   Christ to be dead in vain. No, no, no! He trusts in the death of
   Christ! He puts his sole and entire reliance upon the great Substitute
   who loved and lived and died for him! He does not dare to associate
   with the bleeding Sacrifice his poor bleeding heart, or his prayers, or
   his sanctifi-cation, or anything else. "None but Christ, none but
   Christ," is his soul's cry. He detests every proposal to mix anything
   of ceremony or of legal action with the finished work of Jesus Christ.
   The longer we live, I trust, dear Brothers and Sisters, the more we see
   the Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ! We are struck with
   admiration at the wisdom of the way by which the Substitute was
   introduced--that God might smite sin and yet spare the sinner--we are
   lost in admiration at the matchless love of God, that He spared not His
   own Son!

   We are filled with reverent adoration at the love of Christ, that when
   He knew the price of pardon was His blood, His pity never withdrew.
   What is more, we not only joy in Christ, but we feel an increasing
   oneness with Him. We did not know it at first, but we know it now, that
   we were crucified with Him, that we were buried with Him, that we rose
   again with Him! We are not going to have Moses for a ruler, or Aaron
   for a priest, for Jesus is both King and Priest to us! Christ is in us
   and we are in Christ and we are complete in Him and nothing can be
   tolerated as an aid to the blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ our
   Lord! We are one with Him and being one with Him we realize more, every
   day, that He did NOT die in vain! His death has bought us real life!
   His death has already set us free from the bondage of sin and has even
   now brought us deliverance from the fear of eternal wrath.

   His death has bought us eternal life, has bought us sonship and all the
   blessings that go with it which the Fatherhood of God takes care to
   bestow! The death of Christ has shut the gates of Hell for us and
   opened the gates of Heaven! The death of Christ has worked mercies for
   us--not visionary or imaginary but real and true--which this very day
   we enjoy and so we are in no danger of thinking that Christ died in
   vain. It is our joy to hold two great principles which I will leave
   with you, hoping that you will suck marrow and fatness out of them.
   These are the two principles. The Grace of God cannot be frustrated and
   Jesus Christ died not in vain. These two principles, I think, lie at
   the bottom of all sound doctrine. The Grace of God cannot be
   frustrated! Its eternal purpose will be fulfilled, its Sacrifice and
   seal shall be effec-tual--the chosen ones of Grace shall be brought to
   Glory!

   There shall be no failures as to God's plan in any point whatever! At
   the last, when all shall be summed up, it shall be seen that Grace
   reigned through righteousness unto eternal life and the top stone shall
   be brought out with shouts of "Grace, Grace unto it." And as Grace
   cannot be frustrated, so Christ did not die in vain! Some seem to think
   that there were purposes in Christ's heart which will never be
   accomplished. We have not so learned Christ. What He died to do shall
   be done--those He bought, He will have--those He redeemed shall be
   free. There shall be no failure of reward for Christ's wondrous work!
   He shall see of the travail of His soul and shall be satisfied.

   On these two principles I throw back my soul to rest. Believing in His
   Grace that Grace shall never fail me. "My Grace is sufficient for you,"
   says the Lord and so shall it be. Believing in Jesus Christ, His death
   must save me. It cannot be, O Calvary, that you should fail! O
   Gethsemane, that your bloody sweat should be in vain. Through Divine
   Grace, resting in our Savior's precious blood, we must be saved! Joy
   and rejoice with me and go your way to tell it to others! God bless you
   in so doing, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

Christ's Universal Kingdom and How It Comes

   (No. 1535)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 25, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Ask of Me and I shall give You the heathen for Your inheritance and
   the uttermost parts of the earth for Your possession. You shall break
   them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's
   vessel." Psalms 2:8,9.

   OBSERVE, dear Friends, the wonderful contrast between the violent
   excitement of the enemies of the Lord and the sublime serenity of God
   Himself. He is not disturbed though the heathen so furiously rage and
   their kings and mighty ones set themselves in battle array. He smiles
   at them--He has them in derision. You and I are often downcast and
   depressed and our forebodings are dark and dismal, but God sits in His
   eternal peacefulness and serenely overrules tumult and rebellion. The
   Lord reigns and His Throne is not moved, nor His rest broken whatever
   may be the noise and turmoil down below. Notice the sublimity of this
   Divine calm. While the heathen and their princes are plotting and
   planning how to break His bands asunder and cast His cords from them,
   He has already defeated their devices and He says to them, "Yet have I
   set My king upon My holy hill of Zion." "You will not have My Son to
   reign over you, but nevertheless He reigns. While you have been raging
   I have crowned Him. Your imaginations are, indeed, vain, for I have
   forestalled you and established Him upon His Throne. Hear Him as He
   proclaims My decree and asserts His filial sovereignty."

   God is always beforehand with His adversaries--they find their scheming
   frustrated and their craft baffled even before they have begun to
   execute their plans! By God's decree the Ever-Blessed Son of the
   Highest is placed in power and exalted to His Throne. The rulers cannot
   snatch from His hand the scepter, nor dash from His head the
   crown--Jesus reigns and must reign till all enemies are put under His
   feet. God has set Him firmly upon Zion's sacred hill and raging nations
   cannot cast Him down! The very idea of their doing so excites the
   derision of Jehovah, He disturbs not His great soul because of their
   blustering. As if it were a banquet rather than a conflict, the Lord
   God, as Himself King, speaks to the King's Son, even to His Anointed on
   His right hand and having acknowledged His royal rank, confers upon Him
   the highest honors.

   At great feasts many a monarch has been known to say to his favorite,
   "Ask what I shall give you and nothing shall be denied you this day."
   Even thus does the great Father say to His glorious Son, the Prince of
   Peace, "Ask of Me and I will give You the heathen for Your inheritance
   and the uttermost parts of the earth for Your possession." He bids Him
   open His mouth wide and request a boundless dominion! He will give Him
   distant nations, yes, and the whole round earth to be His kingdom.
   There is an air of regal festivity and peaceful joy about all this
   which strangely contrasts with the uproar of the adversaries.

   Brothers and Sisters, I wish we could enter, in some measure, into this
   sublime quiet. We may well be confident since God is so. If the Captain
   is assured of victory, it behooves the common soldier to be bravely
   hopeful. The battle is the Lord's and since He is the Lord God
   Omnipotent, fear about the issue of the conflict is foolish and wicked.
   All events are in His hands--His hands who can dash whole worlds to
   dust or create them when it pleases Him. What can stand against the
   almighty will? Who shall say unto Jehovah, "What are You doing?" In
   this eternal All-Sufficiency is our rest and we may, therefore, cease
   from anxiety! Stand still, my weary Brother, and see the salvation of
   God! Put not forth your timorous hands to stay the trembling ark, but
   know that Jehovah can protect His own!

   Lay your Martha cares aside, my Sister--sit at your Savior's feet and
   listen to His voice! He will tell you that God still reigns and that
   His Anointed shall reign, also. Things are not as they seem--all is
   well when all looks ill. If the heavens are clouded, the sun is not put
   out! If the evening has darkened, even to midnight, yet the morning
   comes! To the moment shall it break, nor can all the powers of darkness
   hinder the dawning day! Jehovah's fixed decrees remain engraved as in
   eternal brass, nor can the craft of Hell efface a single line nor stay
   the execution of a single purpose! Despite

   all opposition, the sacred purpose will blossom into the actual
   Providence and the Providence will ripen into salvation. God's plan
   will be carried out without failure in any point and there is no cause
   for alarm.

   If we were more calm and restful we would do our work better, for do we
   not gather both wisdom and courage when we abide in quietness and
   confidence? The joy of the Lord is the strength of His saints. The
   assurance of faith, if we were filled with it, would make us go forth
   "fair as the moon, clear as the sun and terrible as an army with
   banners." Alas, our short-sighted fretfulness, our anxious mistrust and
   our timorous suspicion cause us needless distress, weaken us for
   service and expose us to the assaults of our adversaries! Without the
   preparation of the Gospel of peace our feet are unshod and we are unfit
   for the heavenly pilgrimage.

   Groveling here below among the troubles of the hour, the majority of
   Christians are a timorous people and act like the tribe of Reuben in
   the day of Barak's battle, to whom Deborah cried, "Why abide you among
   the sheep-folds, to hear the bleating of the flocks?" O you who lie
   among the pots and do servile work in abject fear, arise to a braver
   spirit! Up to the everlasting hills and breathe a purer air--gird
   yourselves with the belt of confidence in God and you shall be "strong
   in the Lord and in the power of His might!" May God grant that the
   subject of this morning may help us out of the depressing influences
   which surround us and raise us into fellowship with the calm in which
   Jehovah sits smiling and out of which He says, "Yet have I set My King
   upon My holy hill of Zion."

   Our text suggests to us this morning, first, that the kingdoms of the
   earth and the earth itself are Christ's inheri-tance--"I shall give You
   the heathen for Your inheritance." Leave out those little words which
   the translators have inserted, for they but feebly help the sense. "I
   will give the heathen, Your inheritance and the uttermost parts of the
   earth, Your possession." When we have dwelt upon that we shall then
   notice that this is to be had for the asking--"Ask of Me and I shall
   give." Thirdly, we shall note that the power by which the dominion
   shall be gained is altogether of God--"I shall give." And fourthly, we
   shall remark that in order to complete the conquest of the world all
   existing and all future confederacies against the Lord and against His
   Christ shall be utterly destroyed--"You shall break them with a rod of
   iron; You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."

   I. For our comfort let us notice the teaching of the text that THE LORD
   WILL GIVE TO CHRIST THE HEATHEN AS HIS INHERITANCE AND THE UTTERMOST
   PARTS OF THE EARTH AS HIS POSSESSION. This I

   take to refer to our Lord as Man. Already as God, the kingdom of the
   Divine Son rules over all. There never was a limit to the reign of
   Jesus as God, not even when He was hanging on the Cross--He was the
   everlasting Father even when He was "the Child born, the Son given." It
   is in His wondrous Nature as God-Man Mediator that these words may be
   understood, for so the Apostle Paul evidently interpreted them.

   The mysterious sentence, "You are My Son; this day have I begotten
   You," may refer to the deep and secret Truth of God of the Eternal
   Filiation of our Lord, whatever that may be. But Paul quotes it in the
   13th chapter of Acts as referring to His Resurrection. Here are His
   Words, "And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise
   which was made unto the fathers, God has fulfilled the same unto us,
   their children, in that He has raised up Jesus again, as it is also
   written in the second Psalm, You are My Son, this day have I begotten
   You." It is in resurrection power that Christ comes forth and God gives
   to Him dominion over the earth and all that is upon it.

   Because He lives and was dead He has the keys of Hell and of death. By
   virtue of His humiliation He reigns. For the suffering of death He is
   crowned with Glory and honor. The heavenly host proclaim His worthiness
   to take the Book and open its seven seals, singing, "For You were slain
   and have redeemed us to God by Your blood." He descended that He might
   ascend above all things and fill all things! He laid aside His Glory
   that He might be crowned with this new Glory and honor and might have
   all things put under His feet as the Son of Man. We speak, therefore,
   of Jesus Christ the Risen One, who once died, but has now risen from
   the tomb and quit this earth for the splendors of the New Jerusalem.

   Our conviction is that this same Jesus is to reign over the whole
   world. I shall not enter into the question whether this will be
   accomplished before His Second Advent or will be the result of His
   glorious appearing. I should not like to assert that this consummation
   will be reached before His Advent, for that might seem to work against
   our duty to watch for His coming which may be at any moment. On the
   other hand, I would not venture to assert that the Gospel cannot be
   universally victorious before His coming, because I perceive that this
   opinion is a pillow for many an idle head and is ruinous to the hopeful
   spirit of missionary enterprise. It is enough for me that a wide
   dominion will be given to our Lord at

   some time or other and that assuredly His kingdom shall embrace all the
   nations of mankind. The whole earth shall yet be filled with His Glory!
   The Seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head and clear the
   world of his slimy trail!

   For the next few minutes you will be so good as to keep your Bibles
   open, for the appeal must be to God's own Word. I gather that the
   kingdom of Christ is to be so extensive as to comprehend all mankind,
   first, because, of the exceeding breadth of the prophecy of it which
   was made to Abraham in Genesis 12:3. That is an old Covenant promise
   which refers to Abraham as the father of the faithful and to his one
   great seed, even Jesus, the promised Messiah. Here are the far-reaching
   words--"In you shall all families of the earth be blessed." Assuredly
   they are not as yet all blessed in him to such an extent as to exhaust
   the Divine meaning. When God, in Covenant, promises a blessing it is no
   light thing and, therefore, I am sure that this grand Covenant blessing
   of the nations is something more than a name.

   Though I doubt not that the whole earth is, to some extent, the better
   because of the coming of Christ and His peacemaking death and the
   spread of His pure faith, yet I cannot believe that multitudes who live
   and die in the thick darkness of ignorance and idolatry are really
   blessed in Christ in such a sense as to make it a Covenant blessing.
   How much are Tartary, China and Tibet blessed by the Gospel? There must
   yet be something better for all the families of the earth than anything
   they have up to now received. All the families of the earth shall yet
   know that the promised Seed has lived and died for them and some of
   every kindred and tongue shall find salvation in Him.

   Jacob, too, when He spoke concerning the Shiloh in Genesis 49:10, said,
   "Unto Him shall the gathering of the people be." By the people is not
   meant the seed of Israel, but the nations, or the Gentiles. So the
   Septuagint and the Syrian understand it and so, indeed, it is. Jesus,
   our great Shiloh, sets up the standard and His chosen rally around in
   ever growing numbers till the dispersed of Babel shall find in Him a
   new center and a pure language shall be given to them in Him. The words
   mean not, "gathering," only, but a willing obedience, the fruit of
   faith and the expression of piety. To this is parallel the word of Paul
   in Romans 15:12--"And again, Isaiah says, There shall be a root of
   Jesse and He that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in Him shall
   the Gentiles trust."

   It is evident, then, that the nations shall come to trust in the
   Messiah and thus shall they find life eternal. Moses, too, in
   Deuteronomy 32:21, to which passage Paul, in Romans, so especially
   refers, speaks of the heathen nations when he says, "I will move them
   to jealousy with those who are not a people; I will provoke them to
   anger with a foolish nation." Truly this is fulfilled in these days
   when the Gospel line has gone out throughout all the earth and its
   words unto the ends of the earth--and this, our own foolish nation,
   this once barbarous people which seemed shut out from God, worshipping
   idols with all the cruel rites of the Druids, has been brought into
   Covenant with God and made to rejoice in Him!

   Degraded heathens in all lands have become Believers and so shall all
   nations be brought believingly to Jesus' feet, that Israel may be
   angered and provoked to jealousy until her time shall come when she
   shall look on Him whom she has pierced and shall mourn for Him and turn
   to Him with full purpose of heart. When we reach the Psalms, we come
   into the clear light of prophecy concerning the kingdom of our blessed
   Master. Our text stands first and is sufficient in it-self--the heathen
   are to be His inheritance and the utmost bounds of the world are to be
   His possession!

   Turn to that famous passion Psalm, the twenty-second. Its pathos with
   regard to the griefs of the Crucified One is deep and touching. You see
   Him hanging on the tree, a laughingstock to scoffers, with His tongue
   cleaving to His jaws and His heart melting like wax in the midst of His
   bowels--and yet before the Psalm closes the plaintive gives place to
   the triumphant and the dying One cries--"All the ends of the world
   shall remember and turn unto the Lord: and all the kindreds of the
   nations shall worship before You. For the kingdom is the Lord's: and He
   is the Governor among the nations. All they that are fat upon earth
   shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow
   before Him: and none can keep alive His own soul."

   On the Cross this prospect cheered our dying Master's heart, that the
   kingdoms should be the Lord's and that all the kindreds of the nations
   should come and worship before Him! Let it cheer us, also. Do you think
   that the crucified Lord will be disappointed of the end for which He
   died? Will you venture to assert that a single drop of His blood was
   shed for nothing? Rest assured that He shall see of the travail of His
   soul, till even His great loving heart shall be content! God has said
   it, "I will divide Him a portion with the great and He shall divide the
   spoil with the strong, because He has poured out His soul unto death."
   And you can be calmly confident that the Word of the Lord will stand!

   Turn in your Bibles to Psalm 66:4 and there you come upon another word
   of comfort--"All the earth shall worship You and shall sing unto You;
   they shall sing to Your name." This sentence is not merely the
   passionate hope of an enthu-

   siastic worshipper, but a voice inspired of the Holy Spirit plainly
   declaring that all peoples shall adore their Maker with hearty praise
   and joyful song! How glowing is the language of Psalm 72. Can we expect
   too great things for our King when we remember the gracious words
   beginning at the 8th verse--"He shall have dominion also from sea to
   sea and from the river unto the ends of the earth. They that dwell in
   the wilderness shall bow before Him; and His enemies shall lick the
   dust. The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the
   kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. Yes, all kings shall fall
   down before Him: all nations shall serve Him."

   Read on at verse 17--"His name shall endure forever: His name shall be
   continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in Him: all
   nations shall call Him blessed." These terms include the most barbarous
   tribes that exist and they specially mention nations which boast that
   they were never conquered, such as the untamed rovers of the wilderness
   who centuries ago laughed at the Roman power. The legions which subdued
   all other peoples could not conquer the sons of Ishmael! Fleet of foot
   as a rabbit and swift as a young roe, they fled over the desert sands
   out of reach of the pursuer. Yet these shall bow before our Lord and
   joyfully pay Him homage! He will sway His scepter where scepter was
   never acknowledged before! He shall set up a throne where all other
   authority has been laughed to scorn!

   You will not be wearied if I ask you to look at Psalm 86:9. There you
   will find it written, "All nations whom You have made shall come and
   worship before You, O Lord; and shall glorify Your name." It is not to
   be mere outside worship that shall be paid, for the nations are to
   glorify His name which is a high form of praise! All nations are to
   glorify the Lord and this they have not done as yet. We expected to
   find and we are not disappointed in our expectation, that Isaiah would
   be sure to speak concerning these things. I would rather you heard the
   Word of God by far than my word and, therefore, we will keep to our
   reading.

   It will bring you encouragement and cheer your heart to know what
   Prophets said in the olden times when only Israel had the light. They
   did not think the light would be confined to the one peculiar people,
   but they expected that light would break on all the nations which sat
   in darkness and they, also, would seek the Lord. Turn to Isaiah and
   read. See what he says in his second chapter. "It shall come to pass in
   the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be
   established in the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the
   hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and
   say, Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of
   the God of Jacob; and He will teach us of His ways and we will walk in
   His paths for out of Zion shall go forth the Law and the Word of the
   Lord from Jerusalem. And He shall judge among the nations and shall
   rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares
   and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword
   against nation, neither shall they learn war any more."

   I can but give samples. The passages abound all through Isaiah in which
   there is the intimation of the general spread of the Redeemer's
   kingdom. Turn to Isaiah 49:6, 7--"It is a light thing that You should
   be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the
   preserved of Israel: I will also give You for a light to the Gentiles,
   that You may be My salvation unto the end of the earth. Thus says the
   Lord, the Redeemer of Israel and His Holy One, to Him whom man
   despises, to Him whom the nation abhors, to a Servant of rulers, Kings
   shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the Lord
   that is faithful and the Holy One of Israel and He shall choose You."
   And now, verse 12--"Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these
   from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim."
   And verse 18--"Lift up your eyes round about and behold: all these
   gather themselves together and come to you."

   Nor is Isaiah alone in such prophecies as these. I cannot detain you by
   reading what Ezekiel says concerning the ever deepening waters which
   shall carry life to all lands and I will only mention one word of
   Jeremiah, because it so peculiarly proves that the homage paid by
   heathen nations to our Lord will be that of their hearts--and that the
   reign of Christ, whatever else it may be, will certainly be a spiritual
   reign. Jeremiah 3:17--"They shall call Jerusalem the throne of the
   Lord; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the
   Lord, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the
   imagination of their evil heart." Christ will work a heart-change when
   He shall win the nations to allegiance and this shall lead to a
   manifest change of life--"neither shall they walk any more after the
   imagination of their evil heart."

   Daniel, that John of the Old Testament, of course saw more clearly than
   any, the coming kingdom of the Anointed One. Listen what he says
   beginning in 7:18--"But the saints of the Most High shall take the
   kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever. Until
   the Ancient of Days came and judgment was given to the saints of the
   Most

   High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom. And the
   kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole
   Heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High,
   whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and all dominions shall serve
   and obey Him." Can anything be more positive than this last word?

   Look how the idols are to be destroyed according to the Prophet
   Zephaniah (2:11)--"The Lord will be terrible unto them: for He will
   famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship Him, everyone
   from his place, even all the isles of the heathen." Zechariah says, to
   the same effect, (9:10)--"He shall speak peace unto the heathen and His
   dominion shall be from sea even to sea and from the river even to the
   ends of the earth." Lest I should weary you, I dare not quote any more.
   To me it is evident beyond all contradiction that according to the
   whole run of Scripture the kingdom of Christ is to extend over all
   parts of the earth and over all races and conditions of men and,
   therefore, I charge you never despair for the grand old cause!

   An infidel notion is abroad that these different religions have sprung
   up at different times as developments of the religious instinct and
   that they may all profitably exist side by side with ours. It is
   admitted that the religion of Christ is excellent and that it deserves
   a large following, but still other religions have their advantages and
   must not be despised--as if to say that something better than the
   Gospel of Christ may yet be discovered. This is the current talk in
   certain circles and we would at once express our horror at it! Jesus is
   not to share a divided Throne! Cast with abhorrence from your souls
   every such blasphemous thought! Jesus must reign till all enemies are
   put under His feet and to Him all rivals are enemies!

   If Jesus is King, He is the only Potentate. Christians are enlisted
   under a banner which does not allow another standard side by side with
   it! They serve a Prince who will not share dominion with others--who
   will not submit that even a province shall be torn away from His
   government! He shall reign forever and ever, King of kings and Lord of
   lords. Hallelujah! Like a burst of thunder let all hearts that love Him
   say, Amen!

   II. It appears from our text that THIS UNIVERSAL DOMINION IS TO BE
   ASKED FOR. Thus says the Father to

   His glorious Son, "Ask of Me and I will give You." Beloved, Jesus fails
   not to ask. We do not doubt that He responds to the Father's invitation
   and asks for His inheritance. This is the way in which the Psalm before
   us touches upon the priestly character of Christ as combined with His
   kingly office. He always lives to intercede and a part of His daily
   intercession is to ask that the heathen may be His inheritance.

   Now, Beloved, this is a lesson to us. We belong to Christ. We are
   members of that body of which He is the mystical Head and it is ours to
   act with Him in His lifework--as He asks, we are to ask with Him. As
   Jesus suffers in His people, so He pleads in them. Let us cry day and
   night unto God for the coming of the kingdom of our Lord! Let the
   Throne of the Highest be surrounded by our perpetual prayers! Let us
   urge for the Lord Jesus His suit in the courts above, that the heathen
   may be His inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth His
   possession. We are so truly one with Him that His sympathies and hopes
   are ours! His Glory is our glory! His victory our victory and,
   therefore, our supplications should naturally and spontaneously arise
   for Him every day of our lives.

   Our union with Him has given us a kingdom, the same kingdom as that
   which He claims. He Himself has said it, "It is your Father's good
   pleasure to give you the kingdom." As surely as He sets His Son upon
   His holy hill of Zion, so surely will the Lord bring us all there! Our
   prayers, therefore, should daily rise together with the pleading of the
   great Intercessor, Himself. O Lord, Yours is the kingdom and the power
   and the glory! Let Your will be done in earth as it is in Heaven! This
   prayer is one which is commanded by God Himself. About its fitness we
   can, therefore, have no doubt. Your Savior taught you to say, "Your
   kingdom come." In this text we find it prescribed as a prayer to the
   Well-Beloved--"Ask of Me"--and, therefore, it is certainly a proper
   prayer for us and we may use it without question.

   We are highly honored in being permitted to present such a petition--to
   be allowed to pray for myself is mercy, to be permitted to pray for my
   fellow man is favor--but to be allowed to pray for Jesus is an honor!
   It is written, "Prayer also shall be made for Him continually," and
   thus there is a special honor put upon those who intercede. My Lord's
   prayer for me saves me, but when He bids me pray for Him, He dignifies
   me and I say with David, "Your gentleness has made me great." Whatever
   else we forget, never from our private intercessions let us omit the
   prayer that the heathen may come to glorify Christ! It is a joy to know
   that this prayer will be effectual to the fullest. It is no vain
   desire, no dream of a fevered brain--the infinite wisdom of God,
   Himself, suggests it, for He says, "Ask and I shall give You."

   This union of precept and promise is found attached to every Covenant
   blessing, but here it is conspicuously and distinctly stated in so many
   words--"Ask and I shall give You." Concerning this thing,, the promise
   of God is definite! We may, therefore, pray with full assurance. Let us
   avail ourselves of this plain direction every hour of our lives. O
   Church of God, ask, on Christ's behalf, and the Lord God will give Him
   the kingdom! Heir of Heaven, ask on behalf of the Elder Brother, for
   the Elder Brother pleads in you and God will hear both you and Him and
   He will grant the united request! My heart is full of confidence when
   pleading upon this subject! What surer guarantee do we need than, "Ask
   and I shall

   give You"?

   Let our prayer be wide and far-reaching. Let our desires embrace the
   world. Pray not only for your own country, though it needs it and God,
   alone, knows how much--but pray for the colonies, the continent and the
   far off lands. Ask that all heathens may become Christians! Plead that
   the whole round earth may be the Lord's--that the uttermost parts of
   the earth may resound with songs in His praise! On this earth His blood
   has fallen! The precious drops could not be gathered up again and so
   this globe remains blood-marked--the one star upon which the Son of God
   poured out His life! It must be the Lord's! The Sacrifice of Calvary
   has made it sacred to the Son of God! As our Government marks with the
   broad arrow those stores which belong to it, so did Christ, upon the
   tree, when the blood fell from His hands and feet and side, mark, as it
   were, with something more full of meaning than the broad arrow--this
   round earth on which He bled--and it must be forever and ever His by
   right of purchase and ransom!

   It was made subject to vanity for a little season, but it is to be
   redeemed from it--and when it shall be purified and beautified in the
   day of the manifestation of the sons of God, you will not know it, for
   it will come forth as "a new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells
   righteousness." Its sister stars have long wondered at its silence, or
   its discord, but at the sight of its restoration to the choirs of
   holiness, they will sing in deep delight and chant a new song unto the
   Lord! With what admiration will they perceive, rising up from this once
   beclouded orb, a flame of unquenchable praise with pillars of perfumed
   smoke, the incense of eternal gratitude! Sweeter the offering of this
   once fallen world than that of any other sphere, for it has been
   redeemed and upon it have been seen marvels of free Grace and dying
   love such as no other world has known.

   Oh, may this soon come to pass! May the prayer be heard and God be
   praised. But it can only be accomplished through His own appointed
   method, the asking of Christ, the pleading of the Church. Oh, awaken,
   Church, to ask! Awake from your unholy lethargy and cry day and night
   unto God! Cease not, but with anguish, like a woman in travail, cry
   aloud and spare not until He gives the risen Lord the heathen for His
   inheritance and makes His Throne higher than the kings of the earth!

   III. Thirdly, THIS DOMINION IS TO BE GAINED BY THE POWER OF GOD. Notice
   the text, for it is very explicit--"Ask of Me and I shall give You."
   The power and Grace of God will be conspicuously seen in the
   subjugation of this world to Christ. Every heart shall know that it was
   worked by the power of God in answer to the prayer of Christ and His
   Church. I believe, Brothers and Sisters, that the length of time spent
   in the accomplishment of the Divine plan has, much of it, been occupied
   with getting rid of those many forms of human power which have intruded
   into the place of the Spirit. If you and I had been about in our Lord's
   day and could have had everything managed to our hand, we should have
   converted Caesar straight away by argument or by oratory. We should
   then have converted all his legions by every means within our reach.
   And, I guarantee you, with Caesar and his legions at our back we would
   have Christianized the world in no time, would we not?

   Yes, but that is not God's way at all, nor the right and effectual way
   to set up a spiritual kingdom! Bribes and threats are, alike, unlawful.
   Eloquence and carnal reasoning are out of court. The power of Divine
   Love is the one weapon for this campaign. Long ago the Prophet wrote,
   "Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, says the Lord." The fact
   is that such conversions as could be brought about by physical force,
   or by mere mental energy, or by the prestige of rank and pomp are not
   conversions at all! The kingdom of Christ is not a kingdom of this
   world, otherwise would His servants fight! It rests on a spiritual
   basis and is to be advanced by spiritual means. Yet Christ's servants
   gradually slipped down into the notion that His kingdom was of this
   world and could be upheld by human power.

   A Roman emperor professed to be converted, using a deep policy to
   settle himself upon the throne. Then Christianity became the religion
   patronized by the State--it seemed that the world was Christianized,
   whereas, indeed, the Church was heathenized! Hence sprang the monster
   of a State Church, a conjunction ill-assorted and fraught with untold
   ills.

   This incongruous thing is half human, half Divine! As a theory it
   fascinates, as a fact it betrays! It promises to advance the Truth of
   God and is, itself, a negation of it! Under its influences a system of
   religion was fashioned which, beyond all false religions and beyond
   even Atheism itself, is the greatest hindrance to the true Gospel of
   Jesus Christ!

   Under its influence dark ages lowered over the world. Men were not
   permitted to think. A Bible could scarcely be found and a preacher of
   the Gospel, if found, was put to death! That was the result of human
   power coming in with the sword in one hand and the Gospel in the other
   and developing its pride of ecclesiastical power into a triple crown,
   an Inquisition and an "infallible Pope"! This parasite, this canker,
   this incubus of the church will be removed by the Grace of God and by
   His Providence in due season. The kings of the earth who have loved
   this unchaste system will grow weary of it and destroy it.

   Read Revelation 17:16 and see how terrible her end will be. The death
   of the system will come from those who gave it life--the powers of
   earth created the system and they will, in due time, destroy it!
   Frequently do we meet with the idea that the world is to be converted
   to Christ by the spread of civilization. Now civilization always
   follows the Gospel and is, in a great measure, the product of it, but
   many people put the cart before the horse and make civilization the
   first cause. According to their opinion, trade is to regenerate the
   nations! The arts are to ennoble them and education is to purify them.
   Peace Societies are formed, against which I have not a word to say, but
   much in their favor. Still, I believe the only efficient Peace Society
   is the Church of God and the best peace teaching is the love of God in
   Christ Jesus!

   The Grace of God is the great instrument for lifting up the world from
   the depths of its ruin and covering it with happiness and holiness.
   Christ's Cross is the Pharos of this tempestuous sea, like the
   Eddystone lighthouse flinging its beams through the midnight of
   ignorance over the raging waters of human sin, preserving men from rock
   and shipwreck, piloting them into the port of peace! Tell it among the
   heathen--the Lord reigns from the Cross--and as you tell it believe
   that the power to make the peoples believe it is with God the Father
   and the power to bow them before Christ is in God the Holy Spirit.
   Saving energy lies not in learning, nor in wit, nor in eloquence, nor
   in anything except in the right arm of God who will be exalted among
   the heathen, for He has sworn that surely all flesh shall see the
   salvation of God.

   The might of the Omnipotent One shall work out His purposes of Grace
   and as for us, we will use the simple processes of prayer and faith.
   "Ask of Me and I shall give You." Oh, that we could keep in perpetual
   motion the machinery of prayer! Pray, pray, pray and God will give,
   give, give--abundantly and supernaturally above all that we ask, or
   even think! He must do all things in the conquering work of the Lord
   Jesus. We cannot convert a single child, nor bring to Christ the
   humblest peasant, nor lead to peace the most hopeful youth! All must be
   done by the Spirit of God, alone, and if ever nations are to be born in
   a day and crowds are to come humbly to Jesus' feet, it is Yours,
   Eternal Spirit, YOURS to do it! God must give the dominion or the
   rebels will remain unsubdued!

   IV. Thus the power of God works to bring about the kingdom of Christ
   and THIS INVOLVES THE BREAKING UP OF ALL THE CONFEDERACIES WHICH NOW
   EXIST OR EVER SHALL EXIST FOR THE HINDRANCE OF THE REDEEMER'S KINGDOM.
   Our text employs a figure which is very full of meaning. "He shall
   break them with a rod of iron." He breaks not the subject nations, nor
   the inherited heathen, but the kings of the earth who stood up and took
   counsel together against the Lord and against His Anointed. Against
   these He will lift up His iron rod of stern justice and irresistible
   power!

   Over His own inheritance He will sway a silver scepter of love. Over
   His own possession He shall reign with gentleness and Grace, but as for
   His adversaries, He will deal with them in severity and display His
   power in them. How shall they stand out against Him? They have formed
   their confederacy with great care and skill--as when men prepare clay
   and make it pliable for the potter's use, so have they made all things
   ready--they have set their design upon the wheel and caused it to
   revolve in their thoughts and with great skill they have fashioned it.
   Lo, there it stands--finished and fair to look upon! Yet at its very
   best it is nothing more than a potter's vessel. It may be of the purest
   clay and of such exquisite workmanship that it shall enchant every man
   of taste, but it is nothing more than an earthen vessel and, therefore,
   woe unto it when the rod of iron falls upon it.

   Woe to all human societies and brotherhoods which are framed to resist
   the Lord! Mark the conflict and its end! It is brief enough. A stroke!
   Where is the hope of the Lord's adversary? Gone, gone, utterly gone!
   Only a few potsherds remain. Oh for such a smiting of the apostasy of
   Rome! Oh for one touch of the iron rod upon the imposture of Mohammed!
   Oh, for a blow at Buddhism and a back stroke at the superstition of
   Brahmanism and at all the idols of the heathen!

   Woe unto the gods of the land of Sinim in that day! A single stroke
   shall set the potsherds flying. Why, then, should we fear, although
   they plot and plan? Although a solemn conclave of cardinals is held.
   Though the "Pope" fulminates his bulls. Though the Sultan ordain that
   every convert to Christianity shall be put to death. Though the
   scoffers still revile at Christianity and say that it spreads not as
   once it did, a speedy answer shall confound them, or if not speedy, yet
   the stroke shall be sure!

   Our King waits a while. He has leisure. Haste belongs to weakness. His
   strength moves calmly. Only let Him be awakened and you shall see how
   quick are His paces! He redeemed the world in a few short hours upon
   the Cross and I guarantee you that when He gets that iron rod once to
   working, He will not need many days to ease Him of His adversaries and
   make a clean sweep of all that set themselves against Him! If you want
   to see how it will be done, read, I pray you, Daniel 2:31--"You, O
   king, saw and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness
   was excellent, stood before you; and the form thereof was terrible.
   This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver,
   his belly and his thighs of brass, his legs of iron, his feet part of
   iron and part of clay."

   It was a strange conglomeration--all the metallic empires are set forth
   as combined in one image--which image is the embodied idea of
   monarchical power which has fascinated men even to this day. The
   Prophet goes on to say, "You saw still that a stone was cut out without
   hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay
   and broke them to pieces. Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the
   silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the chaff
   of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away, that no
   place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a
   great mountain and filled the whole earth."

   And so it is to be--the vision is being each day fulfilled. The Gospel
   stone, which owes nothing to human strength or wisdom, is breaking the
   image and scattering all opposing powers. No system, society,
   confederacy, or cabinet can stand which is opposed to the Truth of God
   and righteousness. I, even I, that am but of yesterday and know
   nothing, have seen one of the mightiest of empires of modern times melt
   away all of a sudden as the frost of the morning in the heat of the
   sun. I have seen monarchs driven out of their tyrannies by the powers
   of a single man and a free nation born as in an hour. I have seen
   states which fought to hold the Negro in perpetual captivity subdued by
   those whom they despised, while the slave has been set free!

   I have seen nations chastened under evil governments and revived when
   the yoke has been broken and they have returned to the way of
   righteousness and peace. He who lives longest shall see most of this.
   Evil is short-lived. Truth shall yet rise above all. The Lord says,
   overturn, overturn till He shall come whose right it is and God shall
   give it to Him. Woe unto those that stand against the Lord and His
   Anointed, for they shall not prosper. "Be wise now, therefore, O you
   kings: be instructed, you judges of the earth. Kiss the Son, lest He be
   angry and you perish from the way, when His wrath is kindled but a
   little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him."

Sentence Of Death, The Death Of Self-trust

   (No. 1536)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 2, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not
   trust in ourselves, but in God which raises the dead." 2 Corinthians
   1:9.

   WE are justified, dear Friends, in speaking about our own experience
   when the mention of it will be for the benefit of others. Especially is
   this the case with leaders in the Church such as Paul, for their
   experience is rich and deep and the rehearsal of it comes with great
   weight and is peculiarly valuable. We are all the better when we are
   distressed for discovering that such an one as Paul was also subject to
   heaviness--we feel safe in following the line of conduct which was
   marked out by the great Apostle and we are hopeful that if he came out
   of his troubles which were so great, we may, also, be delivered out of
   ours which are comparatively so little.

   These footprints on the sand of time help us to take heart. By tracing
   the footsteps of the flock, we are helped to return to the fold and to
   the Shepherd. It would have been a great calamity if such men as David
   and Paul had, through a fear of seeming egotistical, withheld from us a
   sight of their inner selves. God has been pleased to fill a large part
   of the Bible with biographies and histories of human actions in order
   that we who are men, ourselves, may learn from them. Where a biography
   concerns mainly the inner rather than the outer life, as in the Psalms
   and in Paul's Epistles, we are all the more strengthened, instructed,
   directed and comforted, for it is in the inner life that we are most
   perplexed and most in danger of going astray.

   God grant us Grace to make good use of the treasure of experience which
   is stored up for us in His Word! How rich, how varied, how admirably
   selected! If one man can learn by the life of another, surely we ought
   to learn from such memorable lives as those immortalized in the
   Scriptures. Especially may we see ourselves as in a mirror while we
   steadily look into the heart of Paul. As to our own experience of trial
   and of delivering mercy, it is sent for our good and we should endeavor
   to profit to the utmost by it. But it was never intended that it should
   end with our private and personal benefit. In the kingdom of God no man
   lives unto himself. We are bound to comfort others by the comfort which
   the Lord has comforted us. We are under solemn obligation to seek out
   mourners and such as are in tried circumstances, that we may
   communicate to them the cheering testimony which we are personally able
   to bear to the love and faithfulness of

   God.

   Our Lord has handed out to us spiritual riches ofjoy that we may
   communicate to others who are in need of consolation through great
   tribulation. You may think that you are not called upon to preach and
   possibly you may neither have the ability nor the opportunity for such
   public witness bearing, but your experience is a treasure of which you
   are the trustee and you are bound by the law of gratitude to make use
   of all you know, all you have felt, all you have learned by personal
   experience for the comforting and the building up of your Brothers and
   Sisters in Christ. To be reticent is sometimes to be treacherous--you
   may be found unfaithful to your charge unless you endeavor to improve
   for the general good the dealings of the Lord with your soul. I would
   exhort every Christian to reflect the light which falls upon him.

   Brother, echo your Master's voice faithfully and clearly! What the Lord
   has whispered to you in your ear in closets, proclaim according to your
   ability upon the housetops! If you have found honey, eat of it, yet eat
   not the feast alone, but call in others who can appreciate its
   sweetness that they may rejoice with you! If you have discovered a
   well, drink and quench your thirst, but hasten forthwith to call the
   whole caravan, that every traveler may also drink! If you have been
   sick and you have been healed, tell the glad news to all sick folk
   around you and let them know where they, too, may find a cure.

   Perhaps your telling of the news may have more weight with men than all
   our preaching--they know you and have seen the change which Grace has
   worked in you and you will, by your own experience, give them proof and
   evidence

   which they cannot deny. May the Holy Spirit help you in this thing. Let
   this stand for the preface to our sermon and let us learn, once and for
   all, that, as Paul used his experience for the comfort and edification
   of the Churches, so is every Believer called upon to use their
   experience for the benefit of his fellow Christians. The particular
   experience of which Paul speaks was a certain trial, or probably series
   of trials, which he endured in Asia. You know how he was stoned at
   Lystra and how he was followed by his malicious countrymen from town to
   town wherever he went, that they might excite the mob against him.

   You recollect the uproar at Ephesus and the constant danger to which
   Paul was exposed from perils of all kinds, but it must not be forgotten
   that he appears to have been suffering, at the same time, grievous
   sickness of body and that the multiple, together, caused very deep
   depression of mind. His tribulations abounded--outside were fights and
   within were fears. I call to your notice the strong expressions which
   he uses in the 8th verse--"We were pressed"--he says. The word is such
   as you would use if you were speaking of a cart loaded with sheaves
   till it could not bear up under the weight--it is overloaded and
   threatens to break down and fall by the way. Or the word might be used
   if you spoke of a man who was weighted with too great a burden, under
   which he was ready to fall. Or, perhaps, better still, if you were
   speaking of a ship which had taken too much cargo and sank nearly to
   the water's edge, looking as if it must sink altogether through
   excessive pressure.

   Paul says that this was his condition of mind when he was in Asia--"We
   were pressed." To strengthen the language he adds, "out of measure." He
   was pressed out of measure. He could convey no idea of the degree of
   pressure put upon him--it seemed to be beyond the measure of his
   strength. All trials, we are taught in Scripture, are sent to us in
   measure and so were Paul's, but for the time being he, himself, could
   see no limit to them and he seemed to be quite crushed. Paul could not
   tell how much he was tried. He could not calculate the pressure--it was
   more severe than he could estimate! So great, so heavy was the burden
   upon his mind, that he gave up calculating its weight.

   Then he adds another word, "above strength," because a man may be
   pressed out of measure and yet he may have such remarkable strength
   that he may bear up under it all. The posts and bars and gates of Gaza
   must have pressed Samson and they must have pressed him out of measure,
   but still, not beyond his strength because gigantic force was given to
   those mighty limbs of his so that he readily carried what would have
   crushed another man! Paul says that the pressure put upon him was
   beyond his strength, He was quite unable to cope with it and his
   spirits so failed him that he adds, "insomuch that we despaired even of
   life."

   He gave himself up for a dead man, for no way of escape was visible to
   him. Into whatever town he entered, he was followed by the Jews. The
   fickle mob soon turned against him--even the converts were not always
   faithful. He had been stoned and beaten with rods and men had sworn to
   take his life. Perils of robbers beset him in lonely places while
   tumult and assault befell him in the cities. Meanwhile, the thorn in
   his flesh worried him, afflictions and cares of all kinds weighed upon
   him and altogether his mind was bowed down under the pressure which had
   come upon him. What a deep bass there is in this note, "We were pressed
   out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of
   life"! May we be spared so grievous a condition, or if that cannot be,
   may we be profited by it.

   We shall, in the sermon of this morning, as the Holy Spirit, the
   Comforter, may help us, endeavor to show the reason for such affliction
   and the good effect of it. First, I shall direct your attention to the
   disease mentioned in the text as one to be prevented by the sentence of
   death--"that we should not trust in ourselves." Secondly, we shall
   dwell, for a little, upon the treatment, "we had the sentence of death
   in ourselves." And thirdly, we will observe the cure--"we should not
   trust in ourselves, but in God which raises the dead."

   I. The first point is THE DISEASE--the tendency to trust in ourselves.
   And we remark upon it, first, that this is a disease to which all men
   are liable, for even Paul was in danger of it. I do not say that Paul
   did trust in himself, but that he might have done so and would have
   done so, if it had not been for the Lord's prudent dealings with him
   both in the matter of this great trial in Asia and in the incident of
   the thorn in the flesh. Where a sharp preventive is used, it is clear
   that a strong liability exists. My Brothers and Sisters, I should have
   thought that Paul was the last man to be in danger of trusting in
   himself!

   He was so amazingly converted, so remarkably clear in his views of the
   Gospel! Indeed, he was so thorough in his faith, so intense in his
   zeal, so eminent in his humility that all could see that his reliance
   was upon Grace alone. No writer that ever lived has set in so clear a
   light the fact that all things are of God and that we must walk by
   faith and depend

   alone upon God if we would find salvation and eternal life! And yet you
   see, my Brethren, it was possible that the great teacher of Grace could
   have trusted in himself! He was a man in whose life we see no sort of
   self-confidence. I cannot recall anything that he did or said which
   looks like vanity or pride. He exhibits deep humility of spirit and
   great faith in God and he evidently had no confidence in himself--such
   confidence he was always disclaiming. He looked upon his own works and
   his own righteousness as dross and dung that he may win Christ. And
   when he does speak of himself, it is generally with special
   self-denials--"I, yet not I, but the Grace of God which was with me."
   "By the Grace of God," says he, "I am what I am."

   It is plain, then, that no clearness of knowledge, no purity of intent
   and no depth of experience can altogether kill in our corrupt nature
   the propensity to self-reliance. We are so foolish that we readily
   yield to the witchery which would cause us to trust in ourselves. This
   wide-spread folly has no respect for knowledge, age, or experience, but
   even feeds upon them! I have heard men say several times and I have
   been ashamed as I have heard the boast--"I am sure there is no
   likelihood that I should ever trust in myself. I know better." Brother,
   you are trusting in yourself when you say that-- the subtle poison is
   in your veins even now! You do not know what folly you can commit. You
   are such a fool that even while you say, "I know my folly," you are
   probably even, then, betraying your self-conceit.

   What do we know? We know not of what spirit we are. We are capable of
   almost everything that the devil is capable of. Yes, and if the Grace
   of God should leave us, though we had been exalted to stand like Paul
   and say, "I am not a whit behind the very chief of the Apostles," yet
   should we fall, like Lucifer, and perish with pride! The silliest of
   the vices may overcome the wisest of saints! Trust in self is one of
   the most foolish of sins, though the commonness of it hides its
   contemptible character. When we say, "I am surprised that I should have
   acted so unwisely," we betray our secret pride and confess that we
   thought ourselves wonderfully wise.

   If, my Brothers and Sisters, you knew yourself, you would not be
   surprised at anything that you might do. If you had a proper estimate
   of yourself, it would rather cause you surprise that you were ever
   right than that you were sadly wrong, for such is the natural weakness,
   folly and vanity of our deceitful hearts that when we err, even in the
   most foolish way, it may be said of us that we are only acting out our
   own selves and we would do the same again, if not worse, were we left
   by the Spirit of God.

   Notice, secondly, that trusting in self is evil in all men, since it
   was evil in an Apostle. Paul speaks of it as a fault which God, in
   mercy, prevented, "that we should not trust in ourselves." Why,
   Beloved, if you or I were to trust in ourselves, we should be fit
   objects for ridicule and derision, for what is there in us that we can
   trust? But as for Paul, in labors more abundant, in stripes above
   measure, laying himself out for the Church of God with heroic zeal and
   wearing himself out with self-denials--at first sight it seems that
   there was something in him whereof he might glory! He walked with God
   and was like his Master and Lord.

   He was an humble but admirable imitation of the Lord Jesus and the mind
   that was in Christ was also in him! He was a noble man--we cannot find
   another man like he! He was one of the most beautiful, well-balanced,
   forceful and influential of human characters and yet it would have been
   a most injurious thing for him to have trusted in himself in any
   degree. He was singularly judicious, far-seeing and prudent--and yet he
   might not rely on himself. If this is so--if his Revelations from God;
   if his deep experience; if his intense consecration; if his remarkable
   wisdom; if his splendid education; if his logical mind and fervent
   spirit--if all these combined could not warrant his trusting in
   himself, what folly would be ours if we became self-sufficient?

   If a lion's strength is insufficient, what can the dogs do? If the oak
   trembles, how can the brambles boast? If such poor things as we are
   dare to be self-confident, we deserve to smart for it! May God keep us
   from this evil in all its disguises, whether it beguiles us in the form
   of boasting of our own righteousness, or flatters us into reliance upon
   our own judgment! In any shape it is a sin against God and a mischief
   to ourselves! May the God of all Grace destroy it, root and branch.

   We see, dear Friends, in the next place, that it must be highly
   injurious to trust in ourselves, since God Himself interposed to
   prevent His dear servant from falling into it. The Lord warded off the
   evil by sending Paul a great trouble when he was in Asia--thus does our
   all-wise and almighty God arrange Providence to prevent His servants
   from falling into self-trust. Depend upon it, He is doing the same for
   us since we have even a greater need--He is arranging all our ways and
   steps that we may not wander into self-conceit. Perhaps our heavenly
   Father is, at this present time, afflicting

   some of you, denying you your heart's desire, or taking from you the
   delight of your eyes. Perhaps He is placing you in circumstances where
   you are puzzled and bewildered and do not know what to do--and all for
   this reason--that you may become sick of yourself and fond of
   Christ--that you may know your own folly and may trust yourself with
   purpose of heart to the Divine Wisdom, for, rest assured, nothing can
   happen to you that is much worse than to trust yourselves!

   A man may escape from poverty, but if he falls into self-confidence he
   has, of two evils, fallen into the worse! A man may escape from great
   blunders and yet if he grows proud because he was so prudent, it may
   happen that his conceit of his own wisdom may be a worse evil than the
   mistakes which he might have made. Anything is better than vain-glory
   and self-esteem. Self-trust before God is a monster evil which the Lord
   will not endure! Indeed, He so abhors it that He has pronounced a curse
   upon it--"Cursed is the man that trusts in man and makes flesh his
   arm." That dread word of warning emphatically applies to those who
   trust in themselves. Let me, then, think most solemnly of the fact that
   if I am relying upon myself for acceptance with God, or for power to
   serve Him, I am cursed!

   I am so and I must be so, because trusting in myself means idolatry and
   idolatry is a cursed thing. The self-truster puts himself into God's
   place, for God alone is to be relied upon. "Trust in Him at all times,
   you people. Pour out your heart before Him." Trusting in yourself, you
   lift yourself into the Throne where God alone may sit and so you become
   a traitor. To trust yourself is the result of a gross falsehood and it
   also imputes falsehood to the God of Truth, for you do, as it were,
   deny that God can be believed and you assert that you can be trusted,
   whereas the Lord declares that no man is the proper object of trust.
   "He that trusts in his own heart," He says, "is a fool." But you will
   not have it so and, therefore, you make God out to be a liar!

   To trust in one's self is a piece of impertinent pride, insulting to
   the Majesty of Heaven. It is a preference of ourselves to God, so that
   we take our own opinion in preference to His Revelation. We follow our
   own whim in preference to His Providential direction. We, as it were,
   become gods to ourselves and act as if we knew better than God. It is,
   therefore, a very high crime and misdemeanor against the Majesty of
   Heaven that we should trust in ourselves. And in whomever this evil
   exists, it makes a man intolerable to God! Yet, Brothers and Sisters,
   this fourth remark must be made, that this evil is very hard to
   cure--for it seems that to prevent it in Paul it was necessary for the
   Great Physician to go the length of making Paul feel the sentence of
   death in himself--nothing short of this could cure the tendency.

   On another occasion it is written, "Lest I should be exalted above
   measure, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of
   Satan to buffet me." In the case mentioned in our text, the buffeting
   of Satan does not seem to have sufficed and God, in His Providence and
   love, deemed it necessary to cause the sentence of death to ring out
   its knell in the Apostle's heart. A sentence of death! Can you conceive
   the feeling of a man who has just seen the judge put on the black cap
   and pronounce the sentence of death? The condemned cell, the iron bars,
   the prison fare, the grim guards--these are nothing compared to the
   death-sentence--the sentence of death! This is terrible! Paul must feel
   that woe!

   A sharp knife was necessary to cut out the cancer of self-trust even
   from such an one as Paul. This bitter potion, bitter as gall, he must
   drink even to the dregs. The sentence must not only be in his ears, but
   be in his very self. "We had the sentence of death in ourselves."
   Nothing short of this could prevent his being polluted with self-trust,
   for if less suffering would have sufficed, the Lord would have spared
   him so dread a sorrow. As stones fall towards the earth, so do we
   gravitate towards self. If we are zealous, self-trust says, "What a
   zealous man you are! You can certainly carry everything before you." If
   we grow diffident, then this same pride whispers, "What a humble,
   modest person you are! You are not conceited or rash, you can well be
   trusted."

   If God grants us a little success in working for Him, we blow the
   trumpets that all men may be aware of it. Our Lord can scarcely send us
   on the most common errand without danger of our becoming like
   Jack-in-Office--too proud to be borne with! The Lord cannot allow us a
   little sweet communion with Christ but what we say, "Oh, what joy I
   have had! What delights at His table! What a precious season of private
   prayer! I am somebody!" Yes, we are prone to sacrifice before this most
   base idol--I say the most base idol--for surely there is no idolatry so
   utterly degrading as the worship of one's self! Alas, we cannot get rid
   of the flavor of the Egyptian leeks and onions! Self clings to us as a
   foul odor not to be gotten out of our unclean flesh!

   Does the Lord teach us much of His Word? Then we grow proud of
   knowledge. Does the Lord help us to comfort His people? Then we set up
   ourselves, at once, as something wonderful in the Church. Does Christ
   reveal Himself to us as He does not to the world? Ah, then our heads
   are ready to smite the stars, we are so great! God save us from this
   subtle mal-

   ady, this spiritual leprosy! I think I may add, even, if nothing else
   but the sentence of death in ourselves can stop us from trusting in
   ourselves, then let even this remedy be used.

   II. But now I invite you for a few minutes to look at THE TREATMENT
   ordained for the Apostle's cure--"We had the sentence of death in
   ourselves," which means, first, that he seemed to hear the verdict of
   death passed upon him by the conditions which surrounded him. So
   continually hounded by his malicious countrymen, he felt certain that
   one day or other they would cause his destruction he was so frequently
   subject to popular violence. He felt that his life was not worth a
   moment's purchase and, therefore, so sick in body and so depressed in
   spirit he felt that he might, at any moment, expire.

   The original conveys the idea, not only of a verdict from without, but
   of an answer of assent from within. There was an echo in his
   consciousness--an inward dread--a sort of apprehension that he was soon
   to die. The world threatened him with death and he felt that one of
   these days the threat would be carried out and that very speedily. And
   yet it was not so--he survived all the designs of the foe. My Brothers
   and Sisters, we often feel a thousand deaths in fearing one. We die
   before we die and find ourselves alive to die again! Death seems
   certain and yet the bird escapes even out of the fowler's hands. Just
   when he was about to wring its neck it flew aloft. Listen! How it
   sings, far above his reach. "Unto God the Lord belong the escapes from
   death."

   A witty saying puts it, "Let us never say die till we are dead." But
   then we shall most truly say we live forever and ever! Let us postpone
   despair till the evil comes. Into a low state of spirit was Paul
   brought--death appeared imminent and his eyes of faith gazed into the
   eternities and this prevented his trusting in himself. The man who
   feels that he is about to die is no longer able to trust in himself.
   After this manner the remedy works our health. What earthly thing can
   help us when we are about to die? Paul needed not to say, "My riches
   will not help me," for he had no wealth. He had no need to say, "My
   lands and broad acres cannot comfort me, now," for he had not even a
   foot of land to call his own--his whole estate lay in a few needles
   with which he made and mended tents.

   His trade implements and a manuscript book or two were all his
   possessions. He says, in effect, "Nothing on earth can help me now. My
   tongue, with which I preached, cannot plead with Death, whose deaf ears
   no oratory can charm. My epistles and my power of writing cannot stand
   me in any stead, for no pen can arrest the death warrant--it is written
   and I must die. Friends cannot help me. Titus, Timothy, none of these
   can come to my aid. Neither Barnabas nor Silas can pass through the
   death stream with me--I must ford the torrent alone." He felt as every
   man must who is a true Christian and is about to die, that he must
   commit his spirit unto Christ and watch for His appearing. He
   determined whether he died or lived that he would spend and be spent
   for the Lord Jesus.

   Brothers and Sisters, we do not yet know what dying is--the way to the
   other land is an untrod path as yet. We read about Heaven and so on,
   but we know very little of the way there. To the mind of one about to
   die, the unknown frequently causes a creeping sensation of fear and the
   heart is full of horror. Paul felt the chill of death coming over him
   and by this means his trust in himself was killed and he was driven to
   rely upon his God! If nothing else will cure us of self-confidence we
   may be content to have the rope about our neck, or to lay our neck upon
   the block, or to feel the death rattle in our throats! We may be
   satisfied to sink as in the deep waters if this would cure us of
   trusting in ourselves!

   Such was the case with Paul, when his gracious Master put forth His
   hand to turn Him aside from all glorying in the flesh. What was more, I
   think Paul means, here, that the sentence of death which he heard
   outside worked within his soul a sense of entire helplessness. He was
   striving to fight for the kingdom and Gospel of Christ, but he saw that
   he must be baffled if he had nothing to rely upon but himself--he was
   hampered and hemmed in on every side by the opposing Jews who would not
   permit him to go about his work in peace. He despaired even of his
   life. He was not able to get at his work, for these persons were always
   about him, howling at him, uttering falsehoods against him and
   hindering him. He became so worried and wearied that he was pressed and
   oppressed, immeasurably loaded and brought into such a state of mind
   that all inward comfort failed him and he was obliged to look above for
   succor.

   His faculties were cramped as with a mortal rigor, his reason argued
   against him and his imagination rather created terrors than
   expectations. He knew the experience so poetically described by Kirke
   White in his hymn upon the star of Bethlehem--

   "Deep horror, then, my vitals froze, Death struck, I ceased the tide to
   stem."

   And he also knew the joy of the other two lines of the verse--

   "When suddenly a star arose, It was the star of Bethlehem."

   Paul's mind was so struck with death within himself that he could not
   stem the torrent and would have drifted to despair had he not given
   himself up into the hands of Divine Grace and proved the loving power
   of God.

   My Brothers and Sisters, you may never have experienced this and I do
   not wish that you may do so to the same extent as the Apostle, for the
   Lord may not bring you into a condition of exaltation where you are so
   exposed to the peril of self-confidence and, therefore, it may not be
   necessary to make you feel, to the same extent, this sentence of death.
   But I am aware that some of God's people here know what it is to see
   death written upon everything within them and around them and these
   dare not trust in themselves!

   Ah, there are times with some of us when we appear to lose all power to
   think aright; when we set ourselves to a subject and our brain will not
   exercise itself upon it; when we wish to do right and cannot tell which
   of two courses is the proper one. At times we cannot make out our
   way--we kneel to pray and find that we cannot pray as we would like to
   do--the whole energy and force of our spirit seems to be shriveled up
   as though the desert heat had blown over the meadow of our soul and
   left every blade of grass and flower dead beneath its burning breath.
   Such things do happen to men and when they happen, this is God's severe
   but effectual treatment whereby He prevents their trusting in
   themselves!

   You have said, sometimes, of a very useful person--"God honors that man
   and I am afraid he will be proud." You might well tremble for him were
   it not that behind the door God whips the man and makes him loathe
   himself in dust and ashes! If the great Father favors any one of you
   with usefulness to any great extent or degree, depend upon it, He will
   favor you, also, with humiliations and spiritual conflicts, unless,
   indeed, you have so much Grace that you do not need these correctives
   and this is not the case with many. Brothers and Sisters, take the
   bitter with the sweet--all things work together for good, not one
   alone, neither the exaltation nor the depression, alone--but "all
   things work together for good to them that love God."

   The compound brings the benefit to us. As one drug in a compound
   medicine counteracts another and the whole result is health, so is it
   with the total sum of different Providences--it brings benefit to us
   and glory to God. I think I need not say any more about this remedy,
   except to notice that the Lord uses the same treatment in dealing with
   men who as yet are not saved. Why is it that one of the first works of
   Grace on a man is to take away all his comfort and hope? I will soon
   tell you. Suppose that a poor man had fallen into such a state of mind
   that he could not bear the sun, but lived in perpetual candle light? He
   dreamed that no light could equal his poor tapers and he despised the
   sun--only candles for him--he hated daylight!

   By the way, I am not wild in this supposition, for there are people who
   cannot worship God without candles, even in the daylight and yet they
   are not said to be insane! But to return to the imaginary case, our
   poor, weak-minded friend is prejudiced against the sun and we aim to
   bring him into brightness. How shall we proceed? I think we had better
   blow out his candles and leave him in the dark and then, perhaps, he
   will be willing to try the light of Heaven. Then I would take him
   outdoors and let him see the sun. And, after he had once beheld its
   superior light, he would never be able to praise his poor candles
   again! The first thing is to blow his candles out--and the first thing
   to bring a man to Christ, the Divine Light--is to put out his own
   feeble tapers of self-trust.

   I have heard of one who fell into the water and sank and a strong
   swimmer standing on the shore did not at the same instant plunge in,
   though fully resolved to rescue him. The man went down the second time
   and then he who would rescue him was in the water swimming near him,
   but not too near, waiting very cautiously till his time came. He who
   was drowning was a strong, energetic man and the other was too prudent
   to expose himself to the risk of being dragged under by his struggles.
   He let the man go down for the third time and then he knew that his
   strength was quite exhausted and, swimming to him, he grasped him and
   drew him to shore. If he had seized him at first, while the drowning
   man had strength, they would have gone down together!

   The first part of human salvation is the sentence of death upon all
   human power and merit. When all hope in self is quite gone, Christ
   comes in and, with His Divine Grace rescues the soul from destruction.
   As long as you think you can swim, you will kick and struggle and
   drown! But when you see the futility of all your own efforts and
   perceive that you are without strength, you will leave yourselves with
   Jesus and be saved. The eternal power will come in when your power

   goes out. The sentence of death in yourselves will prevent your
   trusting in yourselves--death recorded and death confessed to be a just
   penalty will expel all vain hope and Grace will be welcomed and the
   heart will believe with a true faith worked in it by the Spirit of God!

   III. Thirdly, let us think of THE CURE. It was sharp medicine, but it
   worked well with Paul, for we find, first, that Paul's self-trust was
   prevented--every rising token of it was effectually removed. He says,
   "We had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in
   ourselves." Under this influence he preached as though he never might
   preach again--a dying man to dying men! I have heard of Brethren who do
   not expect to die. I do not wish to disturb their hope if it gives them
   comfort, but I know there is something very salutary in my own sense of
   the nearness of death. Christ may come, it is true, and this faith has
   the same effect as the expectation of going Home to Him, but one way or
   the other, the sense of the insecurity of this mortal life is good for
   us.

   To bring death very near to the mind is a solemn, searching,
   sanctifying exercise. Our forefathers of centuries ago were known to
   have a human skull on the table where they read their Bibles. I do not
   recommend so sickening a device-- we can have a memento of death in
   better form than that! Still, it is greatly wise to talk about our last
   hours, to be familiar with the grave, to walk among those little
   hillocks where our predecessors sleep and to remember that all the
   world is like a sandy beach where, after the tide has gone, innumerable
   little worm casts cover all the plain. Such a worm cast, I, too, shall
   leave behind me. This world is full of death's handiwork, a very
   morgue--no, better--name it a God's acre, a sleeping place where
   myriads lie waiting for the awakening trumpet! We, too, may expect to
   sleep with them and, therefore, we must not confide in ourselves.

   Are you a dying man and can you trust yourself? More frail than the
   moth, driven up and down like a sere leaf in the tempest, can you trust
   yourself? I hope a sense of death will work a cure of that tendency in
   us. When the sentence of death assumes the form of an experience of
   despair as to everything that is of our own selves, then it has
   thoroughly worked the cure. I have gone up and down in my own soul
   where once sweet things did sing and fair hopes bloomed and I have
   searched in every chamber to hear a note or find a flower and I have
   found nothing but silence and death. I have gone abroad into the fields
   of my imagination where once I saw much that made my heart right glad
   and I have seen a valley of dry bones where only death reigned.
   Everything which I formerly rejoiced in was touched by the paralyzing
   hand--all was dead within me, sentence was passed and apparently
   executed upon my whole being.

   If a man does not trust God then, when will he? And if this does not
   take him off from self-confidence, what is to do it? This treatment
   never fails when the Holy Spirit uses it. Remember, this was only half
   the result in Paul's case, for he does not only say that by this
   sentence of death he was delivered from trusting in himself, but he was
   led to trust "in God which raises the dead." Now, my Brothers and
   Sisters, we have come out of the gloom of the sepulcher into the glory
   of the resurrection! "God which raises the dead" is our hope! The
   doctrine of the Resurrection is essential to the Christian system and
   Paul takes it for granted.

   When he was delivered from trusting in himself because of the sentence
   of death, the first thing he did was to trust in the God and Father of
   His risen Lord. For first he argued thus--If I die, what does it
   matter? God can raise me from the dead. If they stone me, if they smite
   me with the sword, if they fling me headlong into the sea, I shall rise
   again! I know that my Redeemer lives and that I shall see Him when He
   appears. He inferred, also, that if God could raise him from the dead,
   He could preserve him from a violent death. He that could restore him,
   if he were dead and rotten in the tomb, could certainly keep him from
   dying till all his lifework was accomplished. This inference is
   unquestionably true--

   "Plagues and deaths around me fly, But till He bids I cannot die! Not a
   single shaft can hit Till the God of love thinks fit." Immortal is
   every Believer till his work is done! Paul felt this and was comforted.

   He argued yet further that if God can raise the dead and call together
   the separate atoms of a body long since dissolved and rebuild the house
   out of such ruin, then surely He could take his fainting powers, over
   which the sentence of death has passed and He could use them for His
   own purposes! Thus would I also reason with myself when I am deeply
   depressed. He can make me feel His life within me again! And He can
   make great use of me under all my weaknesses and difficulties. It needs
   Omnipotence to wake the dead! That same Omnipotence can make me triumph
   and enable me to do

   its will, whatever may stand in my way! Is not this a blessed form of
   argument--that God, who raises the dead can do for me, can do in me,
   can do by me great things for which His name shall have glory forever
   and ever?

   Brothers and Sisters, we need to get away, more and more, from
   ourselves and we shall never do it till we write this down in our
   books--that self is dead--we must make a corpse of it. We sometimes
   hear that in setting forth the balance sheet of a banking establishment
   a mistake was committed by putting down a doubtful asset at too high a
   value--we must keep clear of such a blunder in making up our spiritual
   balances. There is no fear of undue depreciation if you say of anything
   which belongs to self, "it is good for nothing! Set it down as
   worthless.''" If, then, you have written yourself down at twenty
   shillings in the pound, my dear Brother, I warn you that you will never
   realize it. But you say, "I never thought to get more than half-a-crown
   in the pound out of self'--you will never get that in good money!

   "Well, I will put it down at a farthing in the pound." You will never
   realize even that! It will cost you more to get it than it is worth--it
   is altogether a deception! He that trusts in himself not only gets not
   a farthing in the pound out of what he trusted in, but he is a loser by
   his foolish confidence. I should not like to realize myself--it would
   be an awful loss and leave a great gap in my checking account, for what
   am I but a mass of wounds, a bag of necessities, a mountain of
   weakness, a world of infirmities and nothing else worth mentioning? Do
   not put yourself down in your spiritual assets at all except as a debt,
   a liability and an encumbrance. Say, "Self is dead," and you will be
   happy if you find that he is dead, for the most of your trouble will
   come from his being too much alive!

   That old corrupt nature--ah, the vagabond--if he were, indeed, dead and
   would never struggle again, what a mercy! But there is still life in
   the old dog--life of a troublesome sort, full of mischief! Wisdom
   reckons self as a dead and worthless thing, to be mortified, but never
   to be trusted. Folly talks otherwise and bids you think well of
   yourself, but do not listen to its doting. He says, "You are getting to
   be an old man now; those gray hairs have brought experience and
   wisdom--you are not like those young chits of children that have just
   come into the Church." No, but there is no fool like an old fool! Mind
   you, do not become another example of that old saying! Do not say to
   yourself, "Ah, now you are a man of wide experience, you are! You are
   not like those narrow-minded people who never went beyond their cottage
   or the hedges of their little farm. You have had a splendidly wide
   experience."

   Ah, but no blunder is so great as the blunder of a great man! No man is
   capable of doing so much mischief as the man who has capacity for doing
   great good. "Oh, but," says someone, "I am so careful, so guarded, that
   there can be no fear of me." Yet no one is so likely to sleep as the
   watchman who flatters himself that he does not even doze! So it used to
   be in the old days--and you watchful people are sure to go wrong if you
   are proud of being watchful. If, on the other hand, you feel that you
   are not as watchful as you ought to be and pray to be made more so, you
   will be kept right. Trust in ourselves is a kind of manna which will
   breed worms and stink and it will make our house unbearable and
   ourselves sick. Sweep it out! Oh, for a state of weakness that is
   strong in the Divine strength! Oh, to be nothing! To be NOTHING, that
   God may be All in All! Amen and amen! So let it be!

Samuel--an Example of Intercession

   (No. 1537)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 9, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in
   ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right
   way." 1 Samuel 12:23.

   It is a very great privilege to be permitted to pray for our fellow
   men. Prayer in each man's case must necessarily begin with personal
   petition, for until the man is, himself, accepted with God, he cannot
   act as an intercessor for others. And herein lies part of the
   excellence of intercessory prayer, for it is to the man who exercises
   it aright a mark of inward Grace and a token for good from the Lord.
   You may be sure that your King loves you when He will permit you to
   speak a word to Him on behalf of your friends. When the heart is
   enlarged in believing supplication for others, all doubts about
   personal acceptance with God may cease. He who prompts us to love has
   certainly given us that love and what better proof of His favor do we
   desire?

   It is a great advance upon anxiety for our own salvation when we have
   risen out of the narrowness of dread about ourselves into the broader
   region of care for a Brother's soul. He who, in answer to his
   intercession, has seen others blessed and saved, may take it as a
   pledge of Divine Love and rejoice in the condescending Grace of God!
   Such prayer rises higher than any petition for ourselves, for only he
   who is in favor with the Lord can venture upon pleading for others.
   Intercessory prayer is an act of communion with Christ, for Jesus
   pleads for the sons of men. It is a part of His priestly office to make
   intercession for His people. He has ascended up on High to this end and
   exercises this office continually within the veil.

   When we pray for our fellow sinners we are in sympathy with our Divine
   Savior who made intercession for the transgressors. Such prayers are
   often of unspeakable value to those for whom they are offered. Many of
   us trace our conversion, if we go to the root of it, to the prayers of
   certain godly persons. In innumerable instances the prayers of parents
   have availed to bring young people to Christ. Many more will have to
   bless God for praying teachers, praying friends, praying pastors.
   Obscure persons confined to their beds are often the means of saving
   hundreds by their continual pleadings with God. The Book of Remembrance
   will reveal the value of these hidden ones, of whom so little is
   thought by the majority of Christians. As the body is knit together by
   bands and sinews and interlacing nerves and veins, so is the whole body
   of Christ converted into a living unity by mutual prayers--we were
   prayed for and now, in turn, we pray for others!

   Not only the conversion of sinners, but the welfare, preservation,
   growth, comfort and usefulness of saints are abundantly promoted by the
   prayers of their Brothers and Sisters and, therefore, Apostolic men
   cried, "Brethren, pray for us." He who was the personification of love
   said, "Pray, one for another, that you may be healed." And our great
   Lord and Head ended His earthly career by a matchless prayer for those
   whom the Father had given Him. Intercessory prayer is a benefit to the
   man who exercises it and is often a better channel of comfort than any
   other means of Grace. The Lord turned, again, the captivity of Job when
   he prayed for his friends. Even where such prayer does not avail for
   its precise objective, it has its results. David tells us that he
   prayed for his enemies--he says, in Psalm 35:13, "As for me, when they
   were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting."

   And he adds, "my prayer returned into my own bosom." He sent forth his
   intercession, like Noah's dove, but as it found no rest for the sole of
   its feet and no blessing came of it, it returned to him who sent it and
   brought back with it an olive leaf plucked off--a sense of peace to his
   own spirit--for nothing is more restful to the heart than to have
   prayed for those who despitefully use us and persecute us. Prayers for
   others are pleasing to God and profitable to ourselves! They are no
   waste of breath, but have a guaranteed result by the faithful Promiser.

   I. Let us first dwell upon Samuel's habit of intercession, for it was
   most manifest in him. We gather this from the text. He says, "God
   forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you."
   It is clear, therefore, that he had been in the continual habit and
   practice of praying for Israel. He could not speak of ceasing to pray
   if he had not, up to now, continued in prayer! Samuel had become so
   rooted in the habit of prayer for the people that he seems to be amazed
   at the very thought of bringing his intercession to an end! The people,
   measuring the Prophet by themselves, half suspected that he would be
   irritated with them and would, therefore, deny them his prayers.
   Therefore in the 19th verse we read, "All the people said unto Samuel,
   Pray for your servants unto the Lord your God, that we die not."

   They greatly valued his prayers and felt as if their national life and,
   perhaps, their personal lives depended upon his pleading for
   them--therefore they urged him, as men who plead for their lives, that
   he would not cease to pray for them and he replied, "God forbid that I
   should." The denial of his prayers does not seem to have entered his
   thoughts. To my mind the words represent him as astonished at the
   idea--horrified and half indignant at the suggestion--"What? I, Samuel,
   I who have been your servant from my childhood since the day when I put
   on the little ephod and waited for you in the house of the Lord? I that
   have lived for you and have loved you and was willing to have died in
   your service, shall I ever cease to pray for you?"

   He says, "God forbid." It is the strongest expression that one can well
   imagine and this, together with his evident surprise, shows that the
   Prophet's habit of intercession was rooted, constant, fixed, abiding--a
   part and parcel of himself. If you will read of his life you will see
   how truly this was the case. Samuel was born of prayer. A woman of a
   sorrowful spirit received him from God and joyfully exclaimed, "For
   this child I prayed." He was named in prayer, for his name, Samuel,
   signifies "asked of God." Well did he carry out his name and prove its
   prophetic accuracy, for having commenced life by being, himself, asked
   of God, he continued asking of God and all his knowledge, wisdom,
   justice and power to rule were things which came to him because "asked
   of God"!

   He was nurtured by a woman of prayer at the first and when he left her,
   it was to dwell in the house of prayer all the days of his life. His
   earliest days were honored by a Divine visitation and he showed, even
   then, that waiting, watchful spirit which is the very knee of prayer.
   "Speak, Lord, for Your servant hears" is the cry of a simple, sincere
   heart, such as the Lord always accepts! We all think of Samuel under
   that little figure so often painted and sculptured in which a sweet
   child is seen in the attitude of prayer. We all seem to know little
   Samuel, the praying child--our boys and girls know him as a familiar
   friend--but it is as kneeling with clasped hands. He was born, named,
   nurtured, housed and trained in prayer and he never departed from the
   way of supplication.

   In His case the text was fulfilled, "Out of the mouth of babes and
   sucklings You have perfected praise" and he so persevered in prayer
   that he brought forth fruit in old age and testified of God's power to
   those who came after him. So famous did Samuel become as an intercessor
   that if you will turn to the 99th Psalm, at the sixth verse, you will
   read a short but very fragrant eulogy of him--"Moses and Aaron among
   His priests and Samuel among them that call upon His name." If Moses
   and Aaron are selected as being consecrated men, leaders of God's
   Israel in service and sacrifice, Samuel is selected as the praying man,
   the man who calls upon God's name. All Israel knew Samuel was an
   intercessor as well as they knew Aaron as a priest.

   Perhaps even more notably you get the same Inspired estimate of him in
   Jeremiah 15, at the first verse, where he is again classed with
   Moses--"Then said the Lord unto me, though Moses and Samuel stood
   before Me, yet My mind could not be favorable toward this people: cast
   them out of My sight and let them go forth." Here there is no doubt an
   allusion to the prevalent prayer of Moses, when in the agony of his
   heart, he cried, "If not, blot me, I pray You, out of Your Book which
   you have written." This was a high form of pleading, but such is God's
   valuation of Samuel as an intercessor, that He puts him side by side
   with Moses and, by way of threat to sinful Israel, He tells Jeremiah
   that He would not even listen to Moses and Samuel if they stood before
   Him!

   It is well to learn the art of prayer in our earliest days, for then we
   grow up to be proficient in it. Early prayer grows into powerful
   prayer. Hear this, you young people, and may the Lord now make Samuels
   of you! What an honor to be called to intercede for others, to be the
   benefactor of our nation, or even the channel of blessing to our own
   households! Aspire to it, my dear young Friends. Perhaps you will never
   preach, but you may pray. If you cannot climb the pulpit, you may
   surely bow before the Mercy Seat and be quite as great a blessing! As
   to the success of Samuel's prayers, read of his life and you will find
   that he worked great deliverances for the people. In the seventh
   chapter of this book we find that

   the Philistines grievously oppressed Israel and Samuel bravely called
   the people together to consider their condition and bade them turn from
   idolatry and worship the only true God. And he promised them his
   prayers as a gift which they greatly valued.

   These are his words--"Gather all Israel to Mizpeh and I will pray for
   you unto the Lord." He then took a lamb and offered it up for a burnt
   offering wholly unto the lord, "and Samuel cried unto the Lord for
   Israel and the Lord heard him." This is one of the grand events of his
   life and yet it is fairly descriptive of his whole career. He cried and
   the Lord heard! In this instance the Israelites marched to battle, but
   Jehovah went before them, in answer to the Prophet's prayer. You could
   hear the rolling of the drums in the march of the God of Armies and see
   the glittering of His spear, for so is the history of the battle
   recorded--"And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the
   Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the Lord thundered
   with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines and discomfited
   them; and they were smitten before Israel. And the men of Israel went
   out of Mizpeh and pursued the Philistines and smote

   them."

   The conclusion of the whole is, "So the Philistines were subdued," that
   is to say, the prayer of Samuel was the conquering weapon and Philistia
   crouched beneath its power! Oh you who know the power of prayer, write
   this on your banners, "So the Philistines were subdued." Samuel's
   prayers were so prevalent that the very elements were controlled by
   him. Oh, the power of prayer! It has been ridiculed--it has been
   represented as an unscientific and an unpractical thing--but we who
   daily try it know that its power cannot be exaggerated and do not feel
   even a shadow of a doubt concerning it! There is such power in prayer
   that it "moves the arm that moves the world." We have but to know how
   to pray and the thunder shall lift up its voice in answer to our cry
   and Jehovah's arrows shall be scattered abroad to the overthrowing of
   His adversaries! How should those be able to judge of prayer who never
   ask at all, or never ask in faith? Let those bear witness to whom
   prayer is a familiar exercise and to whom answers from God are as
   common as the day! Over a father's heart no power has so great a
   control as his child's needs and in the case of our Father who is in
   Heaven, it is especially so! He must hear prayer, for He cannot
   dishonor His own name, or forget His own children!

   When, in his old age, the people began to turn against Samuel and to
   express dissatisfaction with his unworthy sons, it is beautiful to
   notice how Samuel at once resorted to prayer. Look at the 8th chapter,
   the 5th verse--the people "said unto him, Behold, you are old and your
   sons walk not in your ways: now make us a king to judge us." The old
   man was sorely grieved. It was natural that he should be. But look at
   the next words. Did Samuel scold the people? Did he send them home in a
   huff? No. It is written, "And Samuel prayed unto the Lord." He told his
   Master about them and his Master said to him, "Hearken unto the voice
   of the people in all that they say unto you: for they have not rejected
   you"--do not lay it to heart as if it were a personal affront to
   you--"but they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them."

   This slight upon God's servant was a rejection of God Himself and He
   would not have Samuel lay to heart their ingratitude to him, but think
   of their wicked conduct to the Lord their God. Thus, you see, Samuel
   was a man of abundant prayer and in the 21st verse we read that after
   he had entered his protest and told the people of all that they would
   have to suffer from a king--how he would tax them and oppress them and
   take their sons to be soldiers and their daughters to wait in his
   palace and take their fields and vineyards, though they still persisted
   in saying, "No, but we will have a king"--he made no angry answer but
   returned to his God in secret communion. "Samuel heard all the words of
   the people and he rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord."

   Oh, that we were wise enough to do the same! Instead of going about and
   telling one and another of the opprobrious things that have been said
   about us, it were well to go straight away to our closet and rehearse
   them in the ears of the Lord! Samuel was thus, you see, throughout his
   whole official life, a man mighty in prayer and when the people left
   him and followed after their new-made king, our text shows that he did
   not cease to intercede for them. He says, "God forbid that I should
   cease to pray to God for you." Nor was this all--when Saul had turned
   aside and become a traitor to his Divine Lord, Samuel made intercession
   for him. One whole night he spent in earnest entreaty, though it was
   all in vain. But many a time and often did he sigh for the rejected
   prince. The old man had been, from his youth up, an intercessor and he
   never ceased from the holy exercise till his lips were closed in death.

   Now, Beloved, you are not judges of the land, otherwise would I plead
   with you to pray much for the people whom you rule. You are not all
   pastors and teachers, otherwise would I say that if we do not abound in
   prayer the blood of souls will be upon our garments. Some of you,
   however, are teachers of the young--do not think that you have done

   anything for your classes till you have prayed for them! Be not
   satisfied with the hour or two of teaching in the week--be frequent in
   your loving supplications. Many of you are parents. How can you
   discharge your duty towards your children unless you bear their names
   upon your hearts in prayer? Those of you who are not found in these
   relationships have, nevertheless, some degree of ability, some measure
   of influence, some position in which you can do good to your fellows
   and these demand your dependence upon God! You cannot discharge your
   responsibilities as relatives, as citizens, as neighbors, no, as
   Christian men and women, unless you often make supplication for all
   ranks and conditions.

   To pray for others must become a habit to you from which you would not
   cease even if they provoked you to the utmost degree, for you would
   only cry out, "God forbid that I should cease to pray for you, for it
   would be a great sin in the sight of the Most High."

   II. Now, secondly, I call you to notice in Samuel's case his
   provocation to cease from intercession, which provocation he patiently
   endured. The first provocation was the slight which they put upon him.
   The grand old man who had all the year round made his circuit from
   place to place to do justice had never looked at a bribe. He had done
   everything for them without fee or reward. Though he had a right to his
   stipend, yet he did not take it. In the generosity of his spirit, he
   did everything gratuitously like Nehemiah, in later days, who said,
   "The former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the
   people and had taken of them bread and wine, beside 40 shekels of
   silver; yes, even their servants ruled over the people: but so did not
   I, because of the fear of God."

   Samuel, throughout a long life, had kept the land in peace and
   innumerable blessings had come to Israel through his leadership. But
   now he was getting old and somewhat infirm, though he was far from
   being worn out--but they seized on this excuse for setting up a king.
   The old man felt that there was life and work in him yet, but they
   clamored for a king and therefore their aged friend must give up his
   office and come down from his high position. It displeases him when he
   first hears their demand, but after a little time spent in prayer he
   resigns his position very pleasantly and all his anxiety is to find the
   right man for the throne. When the man is found, he is full of care
   that the Lord's Anointed shall be guided aright in the kingdom and
   without a thought about himself he rejoices at the sight of one whose
   opening days promised so well.

   His deposition was a hard thing, mark you--an unkind, ungenerous
   thing--but he did not pray one atom the less for the people because or
   it! He probably prayed much more, for as his mother prayed most when
   the sorrow of her heart was greatest, so was it with Samuel. Beyond the
   provocation which came from slight upon himself, he felt wounded by
   their utter rejection of his solemn protest. He stood before them and
   reasoned with them in the clearest possible man-ner--"What do you want
   a king for?" he seemed to say. "This will be the manner of the king
   that shall reign over you. He will take your sons and appoint them for
   himself, for his chariots and to be his horsemen; and some shall run
   before his chariots. He will take your daughters to be confectionaries
   and to be cooks and to be bakers and he will take your fields and your
   vineyards and your olive yards, even the best of them and give them to
   his servants.

   "He will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give to
   his officers and to his servants and he will take your menservants and
   your maidservants and your best young men and your asses and put them
   to his work. He will take the tenth of your sheep and you shall be his
   servants and you shall cry out in that day because of your king which
   you shall have chosen; and the Lord will not hear you in that day."
   There was sound common sense in all this and every word turned out to
   be true, in fact, before long--and yet they would not listen. They
   said, "No, but we will have a king over us; that we, also, may be like
   all the nations; and that our king may judge us and fight our battles."

   Despite their rejection of his warning, the venerable man did not grow
   testy. It is sometimes the infirmity of wise men of years and weight,
   that when they have presented a clearer case--presented it earnestly in
   all simplicity of heart and the thing looks as plain as that twice two
   make four--then if their hearers deliberately persist in defying their
   warning they grow peevish, or perhaps it is more fair to say they
   exhibit a justifiable indignation. Samuel is always hopeful and if they
   will not do the best thing possible, he will try to lead them to do the
   second best. If they will not abide under the direct rule of the Lord,
   as their King, he hopes that they will do well under a human king who
   shall be a viceroy under God and so he continues hopefully to pray for
   them and to make the best he can of them.

   At last it came to this, that the nation must have a king and their
   king must be crowned. They must go to Gilgal to settle the kingdom and
   then Samuel stood up and in the words which I read to you just now he
   declared how he had dealt with them--how he had never defrauded nor
   oppressed, nor taken anything from them--and he told them that their

   choice of a king was, to some extent, a rejection of God. He told them
   that they were putting aside the best of rules and the most honorable
   of governments to go down to the level of the nations. Still, they
   rejected his last appeal and it is beautiful, to my mind, to see how
   calmly he drops the question when he has given his last address and
   made his most solemn appeal to Heaven. Their obstinate adherence to
   their whim did not cause him to restrain prayer on their behalf.

   The practical lesson of this is that when you are tempted to cease from
   pleading for certain persons, you must not yield to the suggestion.
   They have ridiculed your prayers--they tell you that they do not need
   them--they have even made a taunt and a jest of your pious wishes on
   their behalf. Never mind! Retaliate by still greater love! Do not cease
   to wrestle with God for them. It may be you have been very much
   disappointed in them. Your heart breaks to see how they have gone
   aside, yet go with your deep anxieties to the Mercy Seat and cry out,
   again, for them! What will become of them if you leave them to
   themselves? Do not leave off interceding, though you are provoked to do
   so in 10,000 ways! It may be that you think, partly in unbelief and
   partly through trembling anxiety, that their doom is sealed and they
   will go on to Perdition. Let this rather increase the intensity of your
   prayer than in the least degree diminish it.

   Till sinners are in Hell cry to God for them! As long as there is
   breath in their bodies and your body, cause the voice of your
   supplication to be heard. Your husband, good Woman, what if he grows
   more drunken and more profane? Still pray for him! God, who can draw
   out leviathan as with a hook, can yet take this great sinner and make a
   saint of him! What if your son seems to be more profligate than ever?
   Follow him with many entreaties and weep before God about him, still.
   Loving Mother and gracious Father, join your fervent cries day and
   night at the Mercy Seat and you shall yet obtain your desire!

   III. I come, in the third place, briefly to notice Samuel in his
   persevering intercession. Though the people provoked him, he did not
   cease from prayer for them, for, first, then and there, he offered
   fresh supplication for them and that cry was heard and Saul was dowried
   with a rich measure of favor to start with. Samuel did not cease his
   prayer for Saul when Saul had gone far astray, for we find this
   passage--"Then came the word of the Lord to Samuel, saying, It repents
   Me that I have set up Saul to be king, for he has turned back from
   following Me and has not performed My commandment. And it grieved
   Samuel and he cried unto the Lord all night."

   All night! I think I see the old man in agony for Saul, whom he loved.
   Old men need sleep, but the Prophet forsook his bed and, in the night
   watches, poured out his soul unto the Lord. Though he received no
   cheering answer, he still continued to cry, for we read, a little
   further on, that the Lord said to him, "How long will you mourn for
   Saul?" He was pushing the case as far as ever he could push it, till
   the Lord gave him warning that there was no use in it. "How long will
   you mourn for Saul?" It is to be admired in Samuel, that even though
   Saul may have committed the sin which is unto death and Samuel had some
   fear that his fate was fixed, yet he prayed on in desperate hope.

   The Apostle John puts the case thus--"If any man sees his Brother sin a
   sin which is not unto death, he shall ask and He shall give him life
   for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not
   say that he shall pray for it." He does not, in such a case, forbid our
   prayers, neither does he encourage them, but I take it that he gives us
   a permit to pray on. We do not know for certain that the most guilty
   person has, indeed, passed the bounds of mercy and, therefore, we may
   intercede with hope. If we have a horrible dread upon us that possibly
   our erring relative is beyond hope, if we are not commanded to pray, we
   are certainly not forbidden and it is always best to err on the safe
   side, if it is erring at all. We may still go to God, even with a
   forlorn hope and cry to Him in the extremity of our distress.

   We are not likely to hear the Lord say to us, "How long will you mourn
   for Saul?" We are not likely to hear Him say, "How long will you pray
   for your boy? How long will you mourn over your husband? I do not
   intend to save them." When the Prophet knew that Saul was hopelessly
   rejected, he did not cease to pray for the nation, but went down to
   Bethlehem and anointed David. And when David was pursued by the malice
   of Saul, we find him harboring David at Ramah and exhibiting the power
   of prayer in his own house and in the holy place. For when Saul came
   down thinking to seize David, even in the Seer's house, there was a
   Prayer Meeting being held and Saul was so struck with it that he took
   to prophesying, himself, and lay down all night among them disrobed and
   humbled.

   Men exclaimed, "Is Saul also among the Prophets?" The malicious king
   could not venture to touch Samuel! The Prophet was a gentle, mild,
   loving man and yet the black-hearted Saul always had an awe of him, so
   that he took hold of his garment for protection and after Samuel was
   dead, wickedly sought for his supposed spirit for guidance. The man of
   God had evidently impressed the tall reprobate with the weight of his
   holy character. It is written that God was with him

   and let none of his words fall to the ground--and this was because he
   was a praying man. He who can prevail with God for man can always
   prevail with man for God! If you can overcome Heaven by prayer, you can
   overcome earth by preaching! If you know the art of speaking to the
   Eternal, it will be a small thing to speak to mortal men!

   Rest assured that the very essence of all true power over men for their
   good must lie in power with God in secret-- when we have waited upon
   the Lord and prevailed, our work is well-near done. I pray you,
   therefore, still persevere in supplication and be supported in your
   perseverance by the knowledge that it would be a sin to cease to pray
   for those who have been the subjects of your petitions! Samuel
   confesses that it would have been sinful on his part to abstain from
   intercession. How so? Why, if he ceased to pray for that people, he
   would be neglecting his office, for God had made him a Prophet to the
   nation and he must intercede for them or neglect his duty! It would
   show a lack of love to the Lord's chosen people if he did not pray for
   them!

   How could he teach them if he were not, himself taught of God? How
   could he possibly hope to sway them if he had not enough affection for
   them to cry to God on their behalf? It would be, in his case, too, a
   sin of anger. It would look as if he were in a spat with them and with
   God, too, because he could not be all that he would wish to be. "God
   forbid," he said, "I should harbor such anger in my bosom as to cease
   to pray for you." It would have been a neglect of the Divine Glory, for
   whatever the people might be, God's name was wrapped up in them and if
   they did not prosper, the Lord would not be glorified in the eyes of
   the heathen. He could not give up praying for them, for their cause was
   the cause of God! It would have been a cruelty to souls if he who
   possessed such power in prayer had restrained it.

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, it will be sin on your part if you neglect
   the Mercy Seat. You will grieve the Holy Spirit, you will rob Christ of
   His Glory, you will be cruel to souls dead in sin and you will be false
   and traitorous to the Spirit of Grace and to your sacred calling.

   IV. Our last point is that Samuel showed his sincerity in intercession
   by corresponding action, for he says in the words of the text, "God
   forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you:
   but I will teach you the good and the right way." So far from leaving
   off praying, he would be doubly diligent to teach them and he did so.
   He taught them by reminding them of God's promises, that He would not
   forsake His people and by directing them how to act-- "Serve God in
   truth with all you heart." He urged good motives upon them--"Consider
   the great things He has done for you"--and he added a solemn warning,
   "If you shall still do wickedly, you shall be consumed, both you and
   your

   king."

   After praying for your friends, try, as well as you can, to answer your
   own prayer by using the means which God ordinarily blesses. Some
   persons make idle prayers, for they use no effort for obtaining their
   requests. If a farmer asks for a harvest, he also plows and sows, or
   else his supplications would be hypocritical! If we wish to see our
   neighbors converted, we shall labor for it in all ways. We should
   invite them to go with us where the Gospel is faithfully preached, or
   place a good book in their way, or speak with them, personally, about
   eternal things. If I knew where gold was to be had for the picking up
   and I wanted my neighbor to be rich, I would tell him of the precious
   deposit and ask him to come and gather some of the treasure with me.

   But many never think of inviting a neighbor or a friend who is a
   Sabbath-breaker to go with them to the house of God--and there are
   thousands in London who only need an invitation and they would be sure
   to come, once, at any rate--and who can tell but that once might lead
   to their conversion? If I desire the salvation of anyone, I ought to
   tell him, as best as I can, what his condition is and what the way of
   salvation is and how he may find rest. All men are approachable at some
   time or in some way. It is very imprudent to rush at everybody as soon
   as you see them, without thought or ordinary prudence, for you may
   disgust those whom you wish to win. Those who earnestly plead for
   others and bestir themselves to seek them, are generally taught of God
   and so they are made wise as to time, manner and subject.

   A man who wishes to shoot birds will, after a while, become expert in
   the sport, because he will give his mind to it. He will, after a little
   practice, become a noted marksman and know all about guns and dogs. A
   man who wants to catch salmon has his heart set upon his angling and
   becomes absorbed in the pursuit. He soon learns how to use his rod and
   how to manage his fish. So he who longs to win souls and puts his heart
   into it, finds out the knack of it by some means and the Lord gives him
   success. I could not teach it to you--you must practice in order to
   find out--but this I will say, no man is clear of his fellows' blood
   simply because he has prayed to be so. Supposed we had around this
   parish of New-ington a number of people who were dying of hunger and we
   were to have a Prayer Meeting that God would relive their

   need--would it not be hypocrisy worthy to be ridiculed and held up to
   reprobation if, after having prayed for these people, we all went home
   and ate our own dinners and did not give them a farthing's worth of
   bread?

   The truly benevolent man puts his hand in his pocket and says, "What
   can I do that my prayer may be answered?" I have heard of one who
   prayed in New York for a certain number of very poor families that he
   had visited and he asked the Lord that they might be fed and clothed.
   His little sons said, "Father, if I were God I should tell you to
   answer your own prayer, for you have plenty of money." Thus the Lord
   might well say to us when we have been interceding, "Go and answer your
   own prayer by telling your friends of My Son." Do you sing, "Fly
   abroad, you mighty Gospel"? Then give it wings covered with silver!

   Do you sing, "Waft, waft, you winds, His story"? Then spend your breath
   for it! There is a power in your gifts! There is a power in your
   speech! Use these powers. If you cannot personally do much, you can do
   a great deal by helping another to preach Christ. But chief and first
   you ought to do something by your own hand, heart and tongue. Go and
   teach the good and right way and then shall your prayers be heard!

Divine Surprises

   (No. 1538)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 16, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "When You did terrible things which we looked not for, You came down,
   the mountains flowed down at Your Presence." Isaiah 64:3.

   THE people of God were in a very sad state when this chapter described
   them. Isaiah pictures them as brought into the lowest degree of fear
   and sorrow. He pleads with God to return to His chosen people and
   restore their former peace and prosperity. He makes use of the past as
   an argument for the future and recites the wonderful acts of God in
   days gone by as an encouragement to expect that He would do the same
   again. If it were not that God is unchangeable, no inference could be
   drawn from His past behavior toward us, but inasmuch as He is immutably
   the same, yesterday, today and forever, we may safely infer that what
   He has done He will do again.

   They say that history repeats itself--it were more true to say that God
   abides the same, that His ways are everlasting and His mercy endures
   forever. Therefore it is good and sound pleading to say, "You have done
   this and that, therefore again make bare Your arm and once more let
   Your people rejoice in Your faithfulness and Your power." While we may
   all do this on behalf of the Church of God and find a rich store of
   arguments in her past history, we may also do it for ourselves. Some of
   us are now getting into years and we have known the Savior for 30 years
   or more--we ought to be well supplied with reasons for trusting Him and
   I am sure we are. Let us look back on the past and remember how He has
   forgiven our transgressions, how He has recovered our backslidings, how
   He has relieved our necessities, how He has cheered our despondencies
   and strengthened our weaknesses--He that is our God is still the God of
   salvation and He will continue still to bless us, even to the end.
   Because the Lord is my shepherd and now makes me to lie down in green
   pastures, therefore I conclude that, "surely goodness and mercy shall
   follow me all the days of my life and I shall dwell in the house of the
   Lord forever."

   At the back of whatever I shall have to say this morning will lie this
   grand principle--that as the past is, so we may expect the future to be
   in reference to God's dealings with us. Let us come more closely to our
   point. From the text and from its connection, I gather, first, that the
   Presence of God is the one hope of His people. In this text the Prophet
   speaks of God's doing terrible things when He came down among His
   people. We shall next notice that the Presence of God creates
   surprises--He did "things which we looked not for." We shall observe,
   thirdly, that the Presence of God achieves wonders--"the mountains
   flowed down at Your Presence." And then, lastly, we shall come back to
   where we started and reflect that we may expect the same results from
   the Divine Presence if we are privileged to enjoy it.

   I. First let us meditate upon the fact that THE DIVINE PRESENCE IS THE
   ONE HOPE OF THE PEOPLE OF GOD. The Prophet shows that he believed this,
   for he commences the chapter by a most ardent cry to God that He would
   come into the midst of His people--"Oh that You would rend the heavens,
   that You would come down." A little before this, (in the 15th verse of
   the previous chapter), he had prayed, "Look down from Heaven." But it
   is the characteristic of true prayer that it grows as it proceeds--he
   begins by asking God to look down but he gathers intensity of desire
   and confidence of faith and here he cries, "Come down."

   So eager is Isaiah that God should come and come at once, that he
   speaks to Him as though addressing a warrior who lingered in his tent
   while a battle was raging--who would be so eager to rush to the help of
   his friends that he would not stay to remove the canvas or to lift the
   curtain, but would tear a way for himself through the canopy to come at
   once to the deliverance of those who called him to the rescue. "Oh that
   You would rend the heavens." Stay not, Great God, to pass through the
   gate of pearl, but rend Your heavens--let the blue firmament be torn in
   two and descend from Heaven upon rushing mighty winds for the help of
   Your people!

   When our Divine Lord opened the way by which God could come to us poor
   guilty men, He did not lift the curtain nor fold it up, but the veil of
   the Temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom and so the door
   was left wide open forever--for none can ever fix the veil in its place
   again. It was through the open heavens that Christ went in where He now
   stands to plead for us and by that open Heaven the sacred Spirit
   descended to rest upon the Church. The impetuous character of the
   simile here used shows that the Prophet looked upon the Divine
   visitation as the one thing needed for Israel. O Lord, we do not ask
   You to cause the earth to bring forth plentifully, or to make our
   wealth increase, or to make the kings of the earth favorable to Your
   cause! But come, Yourself, to bless Your people and they will need no
   more! Oh that You would come down! Even so, come quickly.

   Is not this the prayer of every true heart here that knows the need of
   the Church and the need of the age? We do not so much require more
   ministers, or more eloquent teachers, but more of the sacred Presence.
   We do not need wealth in the Church, or magnificent buildings, or
   ornate services, but we crave, above all things, that the living God
   will refresh His people! If the Lord were in the midst of us, if the
   shout of a king were heard in our camps, then would our armies march to
   the victory and our foes would be defeated! The desire of the Prophet
   in the present instance is abundantly justified by the history of God's
   people in all times, for when the tribes were in Egypt, what could set
   them free from the iron bondage? What but the Presence of God?

   The Lord said, "I have surely seen the affliction of My people and have
   heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters, for I know their
   sorrows." Then the Lord came down to deliver them and you know with
   what signs and wonders He plagued the proud Egyptian oppressor! Pharaoh
   said, "Who is Jehovah?" But he soon received his answer when the waters
   were turned into blood and the dust into lice--when the cattle died of
   disease and every green thing in the land was blasted with lightning or
   eaten with locusts! Pharaoh and his people learned that when God is in
   the midst of His oppressed and down-trodden people they are "like an
   hearth of fire among the woods and like a torch of fire in a sheaf."

   God's Presence in Israel with Moses and Aaron brought them out "with a
   high hand and with an outstretched arm." When they started on that
   memorable night, after eating the Passover, what was it that made the
   march of Israel so grand an event in history? Did not Jehovah lead the
   way? When they came to the borders of the Red Sea with the rocks on
   either side and the angry host pursuing them, what was their defense
   but that God looked out from the fiery, cloudy pillar and while His
   smile lit up the midnight of His people and made it bright as day, He
   looked forth from the cloudy side and troubled the Egyptians and took
   off their chariot wheels, so that they drove them heavily? It was God's
   Presence that quickened the feet of Miriam and Israel's daughters on
   the other side of the sea, when they struck their timbrels and cried,
   "Sing you to the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously; the horse and
   his rider has He thrown into the sea."

   God's Presence did it all! He who made His kingly dwelling amid their
   thick array was the glory of their strength, the banner of their joy!
   So was it when their marching was through the lone wilderness. What
   made Israel thrive upon barren sand? What made the nation drink
   plenteously from the Rock? It was the Presence of God that made the
   earth a watered sod, the flint a gushing rill! The tabernacle stood in
   their midst and the Presence of God was symbolized there by a blaze of
   Glory between the cherubim and this it was that made Israel the chief
   among the nations! The whole of the story of Israel proves the same
   truth! God's Presence was Israel's Glory!

   When they grieved Him and provoked Him, then the feeblest of the
   nations round about them tyrannized over them. They were an
   insignificant and defenseless nation of themselves, but when God shone
   upon them, they were great among the nations and the scepter of Israel
   was stretched from sea to sea. "God with us," when written on Israel's
   banner, secured them honor and conquest. But without God they could do
   nothing. Dear Friends, this Truth of God which is thus borne out in the
   history of God's ancient people is certainly true with us, too! The
   favor of God is the hope of all His people. First, we see this in the
   Person of the Lord Jesus Christ. Oh, when did you and I ever obtain
   comfort, or receive hope of acceptance until we saw God with us in our
   flesh?

   The world would have perished if God had not come down to it in the
   Person of His dear Son. At Bethlehem the wondrous mystery was seen--the
   Godhead veiled beneath the form of a Babe. This was the birth of hope.
   So, too, when the Lord Jesus comes to any one of us by His Spirit, our
   hope begins! We see Him as our Immanuel and we are comforted. Dr. Watts
   most sweetly sings--

   "Till God in human flesh I see, My thoughts no comfort find.

   The holy, just and sacred Three Are terrors to my mind. But if
   Immanuel's face appears My hope, my joy begins! His name forbids my
   slavish fear, His Grace removes my sins."

   God saves us by coming to us in Christ with an atonement in His hands
   to put away our sins. Yes, and our hope of the perfection of our
   salvation still lies in the coming of Christ to us! We expect that when
   He comes in the latter day, though our bodies may have seen corruption
   and the worms may have devoured them, yet in our flesh we shall see
   God! When Christ shall come a second time the Archangel's trumpet shall
   sound and then shall we receive the adoption, to wit, the redemption of
   the body for which we now hopefully await.

   Because He lives we shall also live and because He shall come to be
   revealed, we also shall be manifested! Our Lord's first coming in our
   flesh has given us eternal salvation! His coming to us by His Spirit
   has worked in us a living faith and His second coming, by-and-by, is
   the grand object of our hope. That day and hour no man knows, for the
   Father keeps it in His own power, but the consummation of all our hopes
   is wrapped up in it and, therefore, we cry, "Come quickly! Even so,
   Lord Jesus, come quickly! Amen." So, you see, Brothers and Sisters, it
   is the Presence of God with us in Christ which is the ground of all our
   hope.

   Until our Lord's glorious Advent, the Presence of the Holy Spirit in
   the Church is our only dependence for success in all that we attempt.
   If we meet for prayer, it must be praying in the Holy Spirit, for we
   know not what we should pray for as we ought till He instructs us. It
   is hard praying to an absent God--the Lord's Presence is the life of a
   Prayer Meeting. If the Lord is not there to inspire the prayer, He is
   not there to hear the prayer. When we preach, it is poor testifying if
   we have not the Lord's anointing resting upon us and His Presence all
   around us. If the Spirit of God is not with the preacher, a silent
   tongue might be as efficient as the most eloquent speech. So is it with
   our missionary enterprise--it will be a failure unless the Lord is in
   it from first to last. Every missionary might fitly say, "If Your
   Spirit go not with me, carry me not up from here."

   Vain will it be to organize societies, enlist subscribers and enter
   upon actual effort and to spend money and zeal thereon if the Lord is
   not there. "Without Me you can do nothing," said our Lord of old and
   the same is true unto this day! The Presence of God is essential to
   each one of us if we are to be saved. It is well for the prodigal to
   arise and go to his Father, but the saving moment comes when his Father
   meets him. "When he was yet a great way off, his Father saw him and ran
   and had compassion on him and fell upon his neck and kissed him"--there
   was the actual salvation! The lost sheep is not found till the Shepherd
   comes to it. God's coming to a man convinces him of sin--he stands up
   for self-righteousness till the Holy Spirit constrains him to ask the
   Truth. Never did a stony heart turn itself to flesh, or a blind eye
   remove its own darkness! God must come in infinite freeness of Grace
   and work with boundless power of love, or the dead sinner will remain
   dead and the blinded mind will remain blind.

   Yes, and after the work is begun, the Presence of God in the soul is
   necessary for its continuance and progress. We never take a step
   towards God except with God. Even the faintest desire towards Him is
   breathed into us by His own Spirit! And as for the higher works of
   Grace in the soul, they are evidently all of God, for the assurance of
   faith, the confidence of hope and the consecration of love were never
   ascribed by their possessors to any source less than Divine. Let a man
   try to serve God without God and he will fail! Sitting at Jesus' feet
   is our proper posture--when He teaches, we have knowledge--all else is
   conceit! In His company we are happy and useful, but apart from Him we
   are miserable failures.

   Even in Heaven, itself, the Presence of God is the source of joy and
   perfection. Up yonder they need no candle, neither light of the sun,
   because the Lord God gives them light--if He were not among them it
   would be dark as death-shade. The blessed ones drink from the river of
   His pleasures--no other stream makes glad the city of God! Their life
   is His life--their bliss is His own Divine pleasure! They enter into
   Christ's Glory and they are filled with Christ's joy! Is it not clear
   enough that our most essential need is the nearness of God to our
   souls? "My soul, wait only upon God, for my expectation is from Him."
   David's petition shall be mine--"Draw near unto my soul and redeem it."
   "It is good for me to draw near unto God." O Lord, remember Your Word
   unto Your servant--"My Presence shall go with you and I will give you
   rest."

   II. The second point I wish to bring before you is when the Lord comes,
   HIS PRESENCE CREATES GREAT SUR-PRISES--"When You did terrible things
   which we looked not for, You came down." It has always been so.
   Whenever God has come to men He has always surprised them. Even the
   most expectant among men have found their expectations far exceeded,
   while those who have been depressed and have prophesied dark things,
   have been altogether taken aback to see the goodness of the Lord! God
   came to Jacob's house and his favorite son was sold for a slave--the
   Ishmaelites took him down into Egypt. "Ah," said Jacob when he thought
   on this and his other trials, "all these things are against me."

   He could not make out that there could be any good intended of the Lord
   when he cried, "Joseph is not and Simeon is not and you would take
   Benjamin away?" And yet God was doing great things for him which he
   looked not for, for Joseph was set upon the throne of Egypt that he
   might provide a refuge for his old father and his brethren in the days
   when there should be a famine over all the earth. Then would he say
   unto them, "Come down unto me, tarry not; you shall dwell in the land
   of Goshen and there will I nourish you." God was doing for the
   trembling Patriarch, "things which he looked not for."

   I shall not stop to give instances in the history of God's people.
   Often did they cry out, "You are the God that does wonders! Who is like
   unto You?" Do you think the Israelites, when they stood by the Red Sea,
   ever imagined they would walk through it dry-shod? When they stood on
   the burning sand, did they expect to live under a vast sunshade all day
   long? Yet they did, for the cloudy pillar screened them from the heat.
   Did they suppose that their camp would be lit up at night as never
   canvas city had been lighted before, with an illumination brighter than
   our electric lights can give to us? Yet the flaming column was a grand
   illumination to them! When they were starving, did they hope to gather
   angels' bread fresh from the skies? When they were thirsty, did they
   reckon upon a smitten rock yielding an abundant stream?

   When they were bit by serpents, did they expect that a bronze serpent
   would work their cure? When they came to the river, did they look to
   see old Jordan retreat before the priests' feet? When they compassed
   the city of Jericho, did they hope to see the walls tumble down about
   the ears of its inhabitants because the tribes sounded rams' horns and
   gave forth a shout? The history of Israel is a series of surprises and
   unexpected mercies! The Lord does great marvels and His people are
   filled with happy astonishment. It has been even more so in the works
   of Grace. See what God has done for us in matchless mercy. When He
   stood at the gates of Eden and talked with Adam and cursed the ground
   for man's sake, could any onlooking angel have imagined that in all
   this God intended to display the greatness of His mercy, so that where
   sin abounded Grace should much more abound?

   Did any man, did any angel, did any seraph ever imagine that the Son of
   God would come down to be born into this rebel race? Did it ever enter
   into their conception that He would die, the Just for the unjust, to
   bring men to God? Was it ever thought of that sinful man should be
   adopted into the Divine family? Do you not think it a most amazing
   thing that sinful men should be born again and adopted into the family
   of God?--

   "Behold what wondrous Grace The Father has bestowed On sinners of a
   mortal race, To call them sons of God!"

   This was an honor that we looked not for! Moreover, God, having made us
   to be His children, did we ever think that He would make us His heirs?
   Yet He says, "If children, then heirs; heirs of God, joint-heirs with
   Christ." Did it ever enter into man's heart to conceive that the Church
   should be married to Christ, wedded to Him in bands of everlasting
   love? Did it ever enter the dreams of any intelligent being that God
   would lift up man, poor, fallen man, to sit in the person of Christ
   next to Himself?

   Well did David cry, "What is man, that You are mindful of Him? And the
   son of man, that You visit him?" You made him to have dominion over the
   works of Your hands. This is wonderful! Brothers and Sisters, though we
   think we know what God, in Grace, is doing, I am sure we do not! We
   shall not know even when we get to Heaven and when we rise from the
   dead we shall say, "I believed in the resurrection of the dead, but
   this out-miracles all miracles!" When our Lord shall take us up into
   Glory, how amazed we shall be! To talk about that Glory now does ravish
   us, but to be in it, flooded with it, filled with it, crowned with
   it--this will be overwhelming! Surely we shall need stronger frames and
   hearts more able to endure the weight of bliss than those which we now
   have!

   How is it that we continue to be surprised at what God does? I answer,
   first, because our largest conceptions of God fall short. The man who
   has, like Enoch, walked with Him for years, yet knows little of Him.
   Ah, my Brothers and Sis-

   ters, you do not know the heights and depths, the lengths and breadths
   of His wondrous liberality! God is infinite! We are as a tiny shell on
   the beach--we cannot hold the ocean and therefore the measureless main
   must always be a marvel to us. We shall always be, in a measure,
   ignorant and as the unknown is gradually revealed it will take us aback
   with absolute astonishment. Besides, our experience of God is very
   brief. We have lived as yet only for a span, or a hand's breadth. Even
   you old men of 60 or 70 years, what are you? Your life has gone like
   the winking of an eye--it is nothing as compared with the life of God!

   Therefore there must be in God's dealings a great deal yet to come of
   which poor, short-lived insects like ourselves can have no idea.
   Besides that, I am sorry to say our faith is shamefully weak and does
   not look for great things. We have never had such faith in God as He
   deserves at our hands. We have never believed Him for more than two
   pence, when we ought to have believed in Him for all the gold of Ophir!
   He is worthy of a trust boundless as the sea and we have scarcely
   relied upon Him beyond the mere drop in a bucket. By doing "exceeding
   abundantly above what we ask, or even think," the Lord puts us into an
   amazed state. It will always be so. Even in Heaven we shall still be
   astonished, as the poet puts it--

   "Then let me mount and soar away To the bright world of endless day And
   sing with rapture and surprise, His loving kindness in the skies."

   It is a most blessed thing it is so. I am so glad that God does those
   "things which we looked not for" because first, it keeps our life fresh
   and sweet and puts us far from monotony and routine. You people who
   have no God must find life a threadbare tale--one week must be very
   like another and one year as another to you! But some of us can
   sing--"Still has my life new wonders seen." Novels! I assure you that
   no novel can equal in interest the unvarnished facts of Christian
   experience, especially in the case of those who are much tried! Facts
   surpass fictions in their power to surprise. The makers of romances may
   rub their foreheads as long as they like, but they cannot invent
   stories at all comparable to those which happen to us in our ordinary
   lives.

   We do not get tired of living because there is something new every
   morning in the goodness of the Lord--fresh revelations are brought out
   by the trials we are called to endure. Thus He increases our knowledge.
   When you and I enter upon a new trouble, we ought to fall on our knees
   and thank God that He is about to elevate us to a higher Grace of
   dis-cipleship. Sanctified afflictions are spiritual promotions! The
   Christian's experience is like that of the man who is conducted from an
   outer court into inner rooms until he reaches the innermost of all. If
   God opens the first door of gracious knowledge and lets you in, you are
   a saved man as soon as you enter by faith--but there is another door
   and when you enter in there you are not only saved but made useful in
   the saving of others!

   Yet there is another door and if God favors you by admitting you into
   the inner chamber you will be a happy man, mighty in prayer and
   confident in hope. Another door stands within this hallowed chamber and
   if you can find the key, and use it, you will enter into the secret
   hall of intimate fellowship with Christ! I do not know how many rooms
   there are, one within another in the place of heavenly wisdom, but this
   I know, that whenever the Lord is about to introduce His servants into
   a still more secret chamber where they shall be nearer to Himself, He
   generally sends them a new trial to test them and to discover whether
   they can bear a fresh installment of His revelations of love. Bless the
   Lord for trials, for they prove the Lord's faithfulness and endear Him
   to our hearts!

   He will never lead us into a labyrinth without giving us the clue.
   Growing trials in God's hands mean growing Grace--you were once in a
   little canoe and you might not leave the tiny stream. But when years
   had gone by you rowed in a boat upon the river, though you dared not
   leave the shore. Now the Lord has built you a larger vessel and you
   make coasting voyages upon the sea, but He does not mean you always to
   be a mere coaster, carrying a few coals about--He intends you to cross
   the seas, to brave the ocean and navigate the globe! As you are
   gradually fitted for longer voyages, so will you encounter rougher
   storms and so will you see more of the works of the Lord and of His
   wonders in the deep.

   Surprising mercies tend to awaken our gratitude. Have we not marveled
   at the goodness of the Lord? "Bless the Lord," we have said, "I never
   dreamed of such love! This way out of my difficulties is excellent, but
   it is one which I could not have foreseen. I am glad I was brought into
   straits that I might see how my Lord could bring me out of them." I
   almost wish I had been with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the fiery
   furnace! It must have been a fine thing to walk unhurt among those
   glowing coals and to come out and be able to say of all your garments,
   to your children and your

   children's children, "These have passed through the fire. See the socks
   and the hat which I wore amid the flames, there is not a smell of fire
   upon them!" What a wardrobe to pass on to your children's children, to
   show what the Lord has done! Some of us can do this spiritually, for
   our hearts are stored with grateful memories. How much God is glorified
   by His people when He does things they looked not for. Their neighbors
   are surprised. As they tell the tale, even unbelievers are struck with
   it and strangers join to say, "The Lord is good to His people and His
   mercy endures forever."

   Dear Friends, I know that some of you can tell of instances in which
   the Presence of God has worked great surprises for you and I can join
   you in doing so. If you have had rich experiences be sure to tell them
   to others. Perhaps you remember that a fortnight ago, on Sunday
   morning, I preached of Paul's deep experience [#1536--Sentence of
   Death, the Death of Self-Trust] and I said that the experiences of the
   saints were a treasure, of which they were the trustees, for the
   benefit of others. A well-known and beloved Brother in Christ was here
   that morning--I refer to Mr. W. Haslam, a clergyman of the Church of
   England--and he so fully agreed with the remark that he carried it out
   by sending me a book in which he has written out the story of the first
   20 years of his ministry.

   I have much enjoyed the reading of the narrative and to carry out the
   principle, I will now give you in brief, the story of Mr. Haslam's
   conversion as an instance of "things which we looked not for." You have
   all heard of Billy Bray, the Cornish Methodist who was so mighty in
   prayer. There was a certain hill that Billy was accustomed to pass, for
   which he prayed, with all his might, till he believed that his heavenly
   Father had given him that mountain, so that all the souls that lived on
   it should be saved. He visited all the houses and obtained a blessing
   for the inhabitants, but as there were only three houses on the hill,
   he prayed, in his own simple way, that more might be built. It seemed
   an odd prayer and the neighbors did not think it a wise one, but
   nevertheless it was fulfilled.

   Some time later, when he visited that place, he found that Mr. Haslam
   had built a church and schools there and his joy was great until he
   entered the church. At the sight of the surprised choir and the
   Ritualistic performance, poor Bray was greatly downcast and said that
   it was nothing but an "old Roman church." Billy went home and set
   himself to praying, again, for that hill, but the fact was quite
   unknown to those who were the objects of his petitions. Soon the Lord
   hearkened to the cry of His servant and it came to pass that the Lord
   visited Mr. Haslam. His gardener fell sick and in the time of his
   illness his churchmanship failed to comfort him. A Methodist Brother
   visited him and was the means of his conversion. When the man told Mr.
   Haslam that he was converted, he was very grieved and disappointed--he
   felt that he could never make Cornish men into Churchmen--they were
   confirmed schismatics.

   His favorite and most promising Churchman, a Mr. Aitken, had become a
   Dissenter and was actually praying that his master might become the
   same. What was to be done? Mr. Haslam had occasion to visit Mr. Aitken
   and told him about the sad defection of the gardener. "Why," said Mr.
   Aitkin, "you are not converted yourself! I am sure of it, or you would
   not have come here to complain of your gardener." Conviction came into
   Haslam's heart! His former hopes vanished and in sadness he sought the
   Lord. Mr. Aitken said, "The best thing you can do is to shut the church
   up and tell your people you will never preach again till you are
   converted." He could not do that, but on the next Sunday morning he
   went, ill and sad, to read the prayers, determined to send the people
   home as soon as they were finished.

   Instead of that, his eye lighted on the text, "What think you of
   Christ?" and he thought he would make a few observations upon that
   question before dismissing the congregation. For the rest, I will quote
   his own words, lest I should seem to color the incident by telling it
   in my own language--"As I went on to explain the passage, I saw that
   the Pharisees and scribes did not know that Christ was the Son of God,
   or that He was come to save them. They were looking for a king, the son
   of David, to reign over them as they were. Something was telling me,
   all the time, 'You are no better than the Pharisees, yourself--you do
   not believe that He is the Son of God and that He is come to save you
   any more than they did.' I do not remember all I said, but I felt a
   wonderful light and joy coming into my soul and I was beginning to see
   what the Pharisees did not.

   "Whether it was something in my words, or my manner, or my look, I know
   not, but all of a sudden a local preacher, who happened to be in the
   congregation, stood up and, putting up his arms, shouted out in Cornish
   manner, 'The parson is converted! The parson is converted! Hallelujah!'
   and in another moment his voice was lost in the shouts and praises of
   three or four hundred of the congregation! Instead of rebuking this
   extraordinary 'brawling,' as I would have done in a former time, I
   joined in the outburst of praise, but to make it more orderly, I gave
   out the Doxology--'Praise God, from whom all blessings flow'--and the
   people sang it with heart and voice over and over again! When this
   subsided, I found

   at least 20 people crying for mercy, whose voices had not been heard in
   the excitement and noise of thanksgiving. They all professed to find
   peace and joy in believing. Among this number there were three from my
   own house--and we returned home praising God."

   This is a memorable illustration of the statement that when God comes
   down among a people He does things we looked not for! You may hope that
   the Divine Spirit will still display His power over the most unlikely
   persons to the glory of His Grace. He can save the most obstinate and
   bring opposers to the feet of Jesus. Plead with Him to do so!

   III. Thirdly, THE PRESENCE OF GOD DISSOLVES DIFFICULTIES. I would bring
   you back to the text again,

   for perhaps you are beginning to forget it. "When You did terrible
   things which we looked not for, You came down, the mountains flowed
   down at Your Presence." This is a blessed sentence, "The mountains
   flowed down at Your Presence." Israel had enemies which were strong and
   powerful. Nations and kings towered above them like great mountains,
   but whenever God came to help them, the kingdoms dissolved, the people
   were conquered and the mountains and hills were laid low.

   At this present time great systems of error oppose the Gospel of Jesus
   Christ. I need not mention them, for they are before us and seem to
   rise like giant Alps, overtopping our faith. Blessed be God, the Church
   only needs the Divine Presence in the midst of her and all the systems
   of error will flow down at His feet like glaciers which dissolve in the
   summer's sun. Perhaps you have seen a volcano when a stream of lava has
   been pouring down its side and, if so, you have had the metaphor of the
   text before your eyes. God does but touch it and the mountain melts and
   flows away! So will it be with infidelity and superstition, Rationalism
   and Ritualism and every form of wrong. If the Holy Spirit clothes the
   Church with power by His Presence, the powers of evil will not maintain
   themselves for an hour--the fire of sacred Truth and heavenly life will
   utterly dissolve them.

   Many hearts are hard as granite--you may pray for them, talk to them,
   preach to them, but all in vain. What is required is the Presence of
   God and then hearts of stone are turned to flesh, dead souls feel the
   beating of spiritual life and corruption is overcome by resurrection
   power! Do not be afraid, Brother. No heart can stand out against the
   Grace of God when it comes in all its power. Do not despair in
   reference to your prodigal boy--keep on praying and he will yet come to
   the house of God with you and you will sing together the praises of
   redeeming love. Despair of no one so long as you have a heart to pray!
   Within our own selves, also, we may see mountains of difficulty, but if
   we go to Christ and so obtain God's help, every mountain shall sink and
   every rock melt--

   "Your mercy is more than a match for my heart, Which wonders to feel
   its own hardness depart; Dissolved by Your mercy, I fall to the ground,
   And weep to the praise of the mercy I've found." There is nothing in
   you, there is nothing round about you, there is nothing on earth, there
   is nothing in Hell that can stand against you if you have God on your
   side! And you have God on your side when you put your trust in Jesus
   Christ! Between here and the eternal glories of Heaven nothing shall
   ever stand against you if you do but trust in Jesus. No weapon that is
   formed against you shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise
   against you in judgment you shall condemn.

   IV. Lastly, WE MAY EXPECT TO SEE THE SAME RESULTS FROM THE DIVINE
   PRESENCE TODAY and tomorrow and as long as we live. God is the same.
   "Are You not He that has cut Rahab and wounded the dragon?" He is the
   same conquering Lord! The ages may have degenerated, but God has not
   degenerated. Do not say that the Truth of God has lost its power. Its
   power always lies in God and God is still almighty! He can work
   miracles today if He pleases--He could divide the Atlantic as easily as
   He did the Red Sea! "With God all things are possible," not, "were,"

   but, "are" still.

   As to spiritual wonders, people think that Pentecost was with us once,
   but never can return--but Pentecost was only the Feast of First Fruits
   and first fruits predict the harvest! God will do greater things in the
   latter days than He did at Jerusalem at Pentecost. He says to us, "Open
   your mouth wide and I will fill it." We do not believe in Him. "If the
   Son of Man comes, shall He find faith on the earth?" There is such a
   microscopic quantity of it that no eyes but His, which are like a flame
   of fire, could spy it out. Yet, I say, God is the same and as worthy to
   be trusted. And, Brothers and Sisters, we are the same. "No," you say,
   "we are not, we are not such good men as those who lived in the olden
   times." I answer that they had the same passions and infirmities as we
   have now!

   There was not a morsel of good in the Apostles, martyrs and confessors
   but what God put there. One earthen vessel is of the same clay as
   another and the same God may put the same treasure into one as well as
   into another. He can bless you and me as He did Peter, James and John.
   Human nature is human nature, still, both in its degradation and in its
   possibilities. God can make as much of you, my dear Sister, as ever He
   did of Dorcas, or Mary, or Lydia! And He can make as much of you, my
   Brother, as ever He did of any of the worthies of past times, if you
   will but trust Him. This feeble arm could slay a thousand men, or pluck
   up the gates of Gaza, or kill a lion, or pull down a temple upon the
   Philistines if God chose to use it as He did Samson's. The Lord has His
   own choice of instruments and He can make any instrument fit for His
   use if He pleases to do so!

   Brethren, the promises are the same. "Oh," you ask, "how is that? Are
   not some of them out of date?" No, the Covenant is made up of abiding
   promises, suitable for all ages and all of them are yes and amen in
   Christ Jesus! We have the sure mercies of David--they stand fast
   forever and ever. Mark you, there are things yet to be done by God
   which will astonish us beyond measure! We shall cry out against
   ourselves for our drooping and desponding thoughts, for, by-and-by,
   perhaps before some of us see death, we shall behold greater things
   than our fathers saw and shall clap our hands for very joy!

   Read the chapter which follows our text and see what God is going to
   do. "I am sought of them that asked not for Me; I am found of them that
   sought Me not: I said, Behold Me, behold Me, unto a nation that was not
   called by My name." Heathens are to be saved! Far off lands will soon
   be called! Watch for it, work for it, pray for it! Israel is also to be
   gathered--"I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob and out of Judah an
   inheritor of My mountains: and My elect shall inherit it and My
   servants shall dwell there." O blessed hour, when the Jew shall worship
   the Christ whom he crucified! That is not all. There is coming yet--who
   knows how soon?--a new creation. "Behold, I create new heavens and a
   new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
   But be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create: for,
   behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy."

   There will come a time in which the shortening of life after the deluge
   shall be remedied. "There shall be no more thence an infant of days,
   nor an old man that has not filled his days: for the child shall die an
   hundred years old. As the days of a tree are the days of My people and
   My elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands." Yes and there comes
   a time of universal peace. "The wolf and the lamb shall feed together
   and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the
   serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy
   mountain, says the Lord."

   Verily, verily, I say unto you, this text is true! When God shall do
   terrible things which we looked not for, He shall come down among us
   and the mountains shall flow at His Presence. Amen and amen!

"The Disciple Whom Jesus Loved"

   (No. 1539)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 23, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The disciple whom Jesus loved; who also leaned on His breast at
   supper." John 21:20.

   Our Lord loved all His disciples--"having loved His own which were in
   the world, He loved them unto the end." He said to all the Apostles, "I
   call you not servants; for the servant knows not what his Lord does:
   but I have called you Friends; for all things that I have heard of My
   Father I have made known unto you." And yet within that circle of love
   there was an innermost place in which the beloved John was favored to
   dwell. Upon the mountain of the Savior's love there was a knoll a
   little higher than the rest of the mountain and there John was made to
   stand, nearest to his Lord. Let us not, because John was specially
   loved, think less, even in the slightest degree, of the love which
   Jesus Christ gave forth to the rest of His chosen. I take it, Brothers
   and Sisters, that those who display an extraordinary love to one are
   all the more capable of great affection to many and, therefore, because
   Jesus loved John most, I have an enhanced estimate of His love to the
   other disciples.

   It is not for a moment to be supposed that any one suffered from His
   supreme friendship for John. John was raised and they were not lowered,
   but raised with him. All Believers are the dear objects of the Savior's
   choice, the purchase of His blood, His portion and inheritance, the
   jewels of His crown. If, in John's case, one is greater in love than
   another, yet all are eminently great and, therefore, if it should so
   happen that you dare not hope to reach the height of John and cannot
   look to be distinguished above others as "the disciple whom Jesus
   loved," yet be very thankful to be among the brotherhood who can each
   say, "He loved me, and gave Himself for me." If you have not attained
   unto the first three, be happy to belong to the host of those who
   follow the Son of David.

   It is a matchless privilege and an unspeakable honor to enjoy the love
   of Jesus, even if you march among the rank and file of the armies of
   love. Our Lord's love to each of us has in it heights immeasurable and
   depths unfathomable. It passes knowledge. Yet would I not utter this
   word of good cheer to make you remain at ease in a low state of
   Grace--far rather would I excite you to rise to the highest point of
   love--for if already the Lord has loved you with an everlasting love,
   if already He has chosen you and called you and kept you and instructed
   you and forgiven you and manifested Himself to you, why should you not
   hope that another step or two may yet be taken and that you may climb
   to the very highest eminence? Why should you not, before long, be
   styled like Daniel, a "man greatly beloved"? Or like John, "that
   disciple whom Jesus loved"?

   To be loved as John was, with a special love, is an innermost form of
   that same Grace with which all Believers have been favored. You must
   not imagine, when I try to exhibit some of the lovable traits of John's
   character, that I would have you infer that the love of Christ went
   forth towards John in any other way than according to the Law of Grace,
   for whatever there was that was lovable in John it was worked in him by
   the Grace of God. Under the Law of Works John would have been as surely
   condemned as any of us and there was nothing legally deserving in John.
   Grace made him to differ, just as truly as Grace separates the vilest
   sinner from among the ungodly. Though it is granted that there were
   certain natural characteristics which made him amiable, yet God is the
   creator of all that is estimable in man and it was not till the natural
   had been, by Grace, transformed and transfigured into the spiritual
   that these things became the subject of the complacency of Christ
   Jesus.

   Brethren, we do not speak of John today as if he were loved because of
   his works, or stood higher in the heart of Christ on the ground of
   personal merit, of which John might glory. He, like all the rest of his
   brethren, was loved of Jesus because Jesus is all love and chose to set
   His heart upon him. Our Lord exercised a sovereignty of love and chose
   John for His own name's sake. And yet, at the same time, there was
   created in John much that was a fit object for the love of

   Christ. The love of Jesus was shed abroad in John's heart and thus John
   himself was made fragrant with delightful odors. It was all of
   Grace--the supposition of anything else is out of place! I look upon
   this special form of our Lord's love as one of those "best gifts" which
   we are bid earnestly to covet--but most emphatically a gift and not a
   wage or a purchasable commodity.

   Love is not bought. It never talks of price or claim. Its atmosphere is
   free favor. "If a man would give all the substance of his house for
   love, it would be utterly despised." The most supreme love is to be
   sought for, then, after the analogy of Grace, as gracious men seek
   greater Grace and not as legalists chaffer and bargain for reward and
   desert. If ever we reach the upper chambers of Love's palace, Love,
   herself must lead us up the stairs! Yes, and be to our willing feet the
   staircase itself. O for the help of the Holy Spirit while we speak upon
   such a theme!

   I. And now, to come nearer to the text, first, dear Friends, LET US
   CONSIDER THE NAME ITSELF--"The disciple whom Jesus loved." Our first
   observation upon it is--it is a name which John gives to himself. I
   think he repeats it five times. No other writer calls John, "the
   disciple whom Jesus loved." John has thus surnamed himself and all the
   early writers recognize him under that title. Do not suspect him,
   however, of egotism. It is one of the instances in which egotism is
   quite out of the question. Naturally, you and I would be rather slow to
   take such a title, even if we felt it belonged to us because we would
   be jealous for our reputation and be afraid of being thought
   presumptuous. But with a sweet naivete which makes him quite forget
   himself, John took the name which he knew most accurately described
   him, whether others quibbled at it or not.

   So far from there being any pride in it, it just shows the simplicity
   of his spirit, the openness, the transparency of his character and his
   complete self-forgetfulness. Knowing it to be the truth, he does not
   hesitate to say it. He was sure that Jesus loved him better than others
   and, though he marveled at it more than anyone else, yet he so rejoiced
   in the fact that he could not help publishing it, whatever the
   consequences might be. Often there is a deal more pride in not
   witnessing to what God has done for us than in speaking of it.
   Everything depends upon the spirit which moves us. I have heard a
   Brother with the deepest humility speak with full assurance of the
   Divine love and while some have thought that he was presumptuous, I
   have felt within myself that his positive testimony was perfectly
   consistent with the deepest humility and that it was his simple modesty
   which made the man so utterly forget himself as to run the risk of
   being thought forward and egotistical.

   He was thinking of how he should glorify God and the appearance of
   glorifying himself did not alarm him, for he had forgotten himself in
   his Master. I wish we could bear to be laughed at as proud for our
   Lord's sake. We shall never have John's name till, like John, we dare
   wear it without a blush. It is a name in which John hides himself. He
   is very wary of mentioning John. He speaks of "another disciple," and,
   "that other disciple," and then, of "that disciple whom Jesus loved."
   These are the names by which he would travel through his own Gospel,
   "incognito." We find him out, however, for the disguise is too thin!
   But still, he intends to conceal himself behind his Savior. He wears
   his Master's love as a veil, though it turns out to be a veil of light.

   He might have called himself, if he had chosen, "that disciple who
   beheld visions of God," but he prefers to speak of love rather than of
   prophecy. In the early Church we find writings concerning him in which
   he is named, "that disciple who leaned on Jesus' bosom," and this he
   mentions in our text. He might have been called, "that disciple who
   wrote one of the gospels," or, "that disciple who knew more of the very
   heart of Christ than any other," but he gives the preference to love.
   He is not that disciple who did anything, but who received love from
   Jesus--and he is not that disciple who loved Jesus, but "whom Jesus
   loved." John is the man in the silver mask, but we know the man and his
   communications and we hear him say, "We have known and believed the
   love that God has to us. God is love and he that dwells in love dwells
   in God and God in Him."

   The name before us is a name in which John felt himself most at home.
   No other title would so well describe him. His own name, "John," means
   the "gift of God" and he was a precious gift from God the Father to His
   suffering Son and a great comfort to the Savior during the years of His
   abode among men. Jesus doubtless counted him to be His Jonathan, His
   John, His God-gift and He treasured him as such. But John does not so
   much think of his being of any service to his Lord as of that which His
   Lord had been to him. He calls himself, "that disciple whom Jesus
   loved" because he recognized the delightful obligation which springs
   out of great love and wished to always be under its royal influence. He
   looked on Jesus' love as the source and root of everything about
   himself which was gracious and commendable. If he had

   any courage, if he had any faithfulness, if he had any depth of
   knowledge it was because Jesus had loved these things into him.

   All the sweet flowers which bloomed in the garden of his heart were
   planted there by the hand of Christ's love, so when he called himself,
   "that disciple whom Jesus loved," he felt that he had gone to the root
   and bottom of the matter and explained the main reason of his being
   what he was. This endearing name was very precious to him because it
   evoked the sunniest memories of all his life. Those short years in
   which he had been with Jesus must have been looked upon by him in his
   old age with great transport, as the crown and glory of his earthly
   existence. I do not wonder that he saw Christ, again, in Patmos, after
   having seen Him once in Palestine as he did see Him--for such sights
   are very apt to repeat themselves. Such sights, I say, for John's view
   of his Lord was no ordinary one.

   There is at times an echo to sights as well as to sounds and he who saw
   the Lord with John's eagle eyes--with his deep-seated inner eyes--was
   the likeliest man in all the world to see Him over again in vision as
   he did see Him amid the rocks of the Aegean Sea. All the memories of
   the best part of his life were awakened by the name which he wore and,
   by its power, he often renewed that intimate communion with the living
   Christ which had lived on during the horrors of the Crucifixion and
   lasted to the end of his days. That charming name set all the bells of
   his soul a-ringing--does it not sound right musical? "The disciple whom
   Jesus loved."

   That name was a powerful spring of action to him as long as he lived.
   How could he be false to Him who had loved him so? How could he refuse
   to bear witness to the Gospel of the Savior who had loved him so? What
   leagues of journeying could be too long for the feet of that disciple
   whom Jesus loved? What mobs of cruel men could cow the heart of the
   disciple whom Jesus loved? What form of banishment or death could
   dismay him whom Jesus loved? No, in the power of that name John becomes
   bold and faithful and he serves his loving Friend with all his heart. I
   say, then, that this title must have been very dear to John because he
   felt himself most at home in it. The secret springs of his nature were
   touched by it. He felt his whole self, heart, soul, mind, memory all
   comprehended within the compass of the words, "The disciple whom Jesus
   loved."

   It was a name which was never disputed. You do not find anyone
   complaining of John for thus describing himself. General consent
   awarded him the title. His brethren did quarrel with him a little when
   his fond mother, Salome, wanted thrones for her two sons on the right
   and the left hand of the Messiah, but the love of Jesus to John never
   caused any ill will among the Brethren, nor did John take any undue
   advantage of it. I believe that the Apostles tacitly acknowledged that
   their Lord was perfectly right in His choice. There was something about
   John which made his brethren love him and, therefore, they did not
   marvel that their Lord should make him His most intimate friend. The
   truly loved one of God generally receives the love of his brethren.
   Yes, and even the love of the ungodly, after a sort, for when a man's
   ways please the Lord, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with
   him.

   While David walked with God all Israel loved him and even Saul was
   forced to cry, "You are more righteous than I." John was so loving that
   he gained love everywhere. We may well be eager after this choice
   blessing since it, alone, of all known treasures, excites no envy among
   the brethren, but rather makes all the godly rejoice. Inasmuch as
   saints wish to be greatly loved, themselves, they are glad when they
   meet with those who have obtained that blessing. If we would smell of
   myrrh and aloes and cassia, we are glad to meet with those whose
   garments are already fragrant. You never find John lecturing his
   brethren, or acting as a lord over God's heritage--but in all
   gentleness and lowliness he justified the affection which our Lord
   manifested toward him.

   II. Thus much, then, with regard to the name. Secondly, LET US LOOK AT
   THE CHARACTER WHICH LAY

   BELOW IT. I can only give a miniature of John. It is quite impossible,
   in the few moments of a sermon, to draw a full-length portrait and,
   indeed, I am not artist enough to accomplish it if I should attempt the
   task! In the character of John we see much that is admirable. First,
   let us look at his personality as an individual. His was a large and
   warm heart. Perhaps his main force lies in the intensity of his nature.
   He is not vehement, but deep and strong. Whatever he did, he did right
   heartily. He was simple-minded--a man in whom there was no guile. There
   was no division in his nature. He was one and indivisible in all that
   he felt or did.

   He did not entertain questions. He was not critical. He was not apt to
   spy out faults in others and, as to difficulties, mental or otherwise,
   he seems to have been happily without them. Having pondered and come to
   a conclusion, his whole nature moved in solid phalanx with forceful
   march. Whichever way he went, he went altogether and right resolutely.

   Some men go two ways, or they tack about, or they go towards their
   objective in an indirect manner. But John steams straight forward with
   the fires blazing and the engine working at full speed. His whole soul
   was engaged in his Lord's cause, for he was a deep thinker, a silent
   student and then a forceful actor. He was not impetuous with the haste
   of Peter, but yet he was determined and thorough-going and all on fire
   with zeal.

   He was exceedingly livid in his beliefs and believed to the utmost what
   he had learned of his Lord. Read his Epistle through and see how many
   times he says "we know," "we know," "we know." There are no, "ifs,"
   about him. He is a deep and strong Believer. His heart gives an
   unfeigned assent and consent. There was an intense warmth about John.
   He loved his Lord, he loved his Brethren. He loved with a large heart,
   for he had a grand nature. He loved constantly and he loved in such a
   way as to be practically courageous for his Master, for he was a bold
   man, a true son of thunder. He was ready to go to the front if he was
   bound to do so, but in a quiet way and not with a rush and a noise--his
   is not the dash of a waterfall, but the still flow of a deep river.

   Putting all together that we know about his personality, we look upon
   him as a man who was the reverse of your cold, calculating, slow-moving
   son of diffidence. You know the sort of persons I mean--very good
   people in their way, but by no means fascinating or much to be
   imitated. He was quite the reverse of those dried, juiceless Brethren
   who have no human nature in them--men who are somewhere about
   perfect--for they have not life enough to sin. They do no wrong, or
   rather they do nothing at all. I know a few of those delightful people,
   sharp critics of others and faultless themselves with this one
   exception--they are heartless. John was a hearty man--a man of brain,
   but of soul, too--a soul which went out to the tips of his fingers. He
   was a man who was permeated with intense but quiet life--in a word, a
   man to be loved. His life was not that of an ice-plant, but of the red
   rose. He carried summer in his countenance, energy in his manner,
   steady force in all his movements. He was like that other John of whom
   he was once a disciple, "a burning and a shining light." There was
   warmth as well as light in him. He was intense, sincere and unselfish
   by nature and a fullness of Divine Grace came upon him and sanctified
   these virtues.

   Let us now view him in his relation to his Lord. The name he takes to
   himself is, "the disciple whom Jesus loved." Jesus loved him as a
   disciple. What sort of disciples do masters love? You that have ever
   been teachers of youth know that if teachers had their choice, certain
   persons would be selected before others. If we teach, we love teachable
   people! Such was John. He was a man quick to learn. He was not like
   Thomas who was slow, argumentative, cautious. But having once assured
   himself that he had a true Teacher, he gave himself right up to Jesus
   and was willing to receive what He had to reveal. He was a disciple of
   a very keen eye, seeing into the soul of his Instructor's teaching. His
   emblem in the early church was the eagle--the eagle which soars, but
   also the eagle which sees from afar.

   John saw the spiritual meaning of types and emblems. He did not stop at
   the outward symbols, as some of the disciples did, but his penetrating
   soul read into the depths of the Truth of God. You can see this both in
   his Gospel and in his Epistles. He is a spiritually-minded man. He
   stays not in the letter, but he dives beneath the surface. He pierces
   through the shell and reaches the inner teaching. His first master was
   John the Baptist and he was so good a disciple that he was the first to
   leave his teacher! You hint that this did not show that he was a good
   disciple? Indeed it did, for it was the Baptist's aim to send his
   followers to Jesus! The Baptist said, "Behold the Lamb of God, which
   takes away the sin of the world" and John was so good a follower of the
   forerunner that he immediately followed the Lord, Himself, to whom the
   forerunner introduced him.

   This he did without a violent jerk--his progress was natural and even.
   Paul came to Jesus with a great start and twist, when he was put upon
   the lines on the road to Damascus. But John glided gently to the
   Baptist and then from the Baptist to Jesus. He was not obstinate,
   neither was he weak, but he was teachable and so he made steady
   progress in his learning. Such a disciple is one that a teacher is sure
   to love and John was, therefore, "the disciple whom Jesus loved." He
   was full of faith to accept what he was taught. He believed it and he
   believed it really and thoroughly. He did not believe, as some people
   do, with the fingertips of their understanding, but he gripped the
   Truth of God with both hands, laid it up in his heart and allowed it to
   flow from that center and saturate his whole being.

   He was a Believer in his inmost soul, both when he saw the blood and
   water at the Cross and the folded grave clothes at the sepulcher--he
   saw and believed. His faith worked in him a strong and enduring love,
   for faith works by love. He believed in his Master in a sweetly
   familiar way, "for there is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out
   fear." Such a trustful, confiding disciple is sure to be loved of his
   teacher. John had great receptiveness. He drank in what he was taught.
   He

   was like Gideon's fleece, ready to be saturated with the dew of Heaven.
   His whole nature absorbed the Truth as it is in Jesus. He was not a
   great talker--I think he was almost a silent disciple. So little did he
   say that we have only one saying of his recorded in the Gospels. "Why,"
   says one, "I remember two or three." Do you remind me that he asked
   that he might sit on the right hand of Christ? I have not forgotten
   that request, but I answer that his mother, Salome, spoke on that
   occasion.

   Again, you tell me that at the supper he asked, "Lord, who is it?" Yes,
   but it was Peter who put that question into his mouth. The only
   utterance that I remember in the Gospel which was altogether John's is
   that at the sea of Tiberius, when he said to Peter, "It is the Lord."
   This was a very significant little speech--a recognition of his Lord
   such as the quick eyes of love are sure to make. He who lived nearest
   to Jesus could best discern Him as He stood upon the shore. "It is the
   Lord," is the gladsome cry of love, overjoyed at the sight of its
   Beloved! It might have served John as his motto-- "It is the Lord." O
   that we were able amid darkness and tossing to discern the Savior and
   rejoice in His Presence! "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall
   see God"--and such was the beloved disciple!

   One great trait in John's character as a disciple was his intense love
   for his Teacher. He not only received the Truth of God, but he received
   the Master Himself. I take it that the leaning of a man's faults often
   betrays his heart more than his virtues. It may seem a strange
   observation to make, but it is true. A true heart may as well be seen
   in its weakness as in its excellence. What were the weak points about
   John, as some would say? On one occasion he was intolerant. Certain
   persons were casting out devils and he forbade them because they
   followed not with the disciples. Now, that intolerance, mistaken as it
   was, grew out of love to his Lord! He was afraid that these interlopers
   might set up as rivals to his Lord and he wanted them to come under the
   rule of his beloved Jesus.

   At another time the Samaritans would not receive them and he asked his
   Master if he might call down fire from Heaven on them. One does not
   commend him, but still it was love to Jesus which made him indignant at
   their ungenerous conduct to their best Friend. He felt so indignant
   that men should not entertain the Savior who had come into the world to
   bless them, that he would even call fire from Heaven--it showed his
   burning love for Jesus. Even when his mother asked that he and the
   brother might sit upon thrones at the right hand and the left hand of
   Christ, it was a deep and thoughtful faith in Jesus which suggested it.
   His idea of honor and glory was bound up with Jesus! If he gives way to
   ambition it is an ambition to reign with the despised Galilean. He does
   not want a throne unless it is at his Lord's side.

   Moreover, what faith there was in that request! I am not going to
   justify it, but I am going to say something to moderate your
   condemnation. Our Lord was going up to Jerusalem to be spit upon and to
   be put to death and yet John so thoroughly threw himself into his
   Lord's career that he would gladly share in the fortune of his great
   Caesar, assured that it must end in His enthronement. He is content, he
   says, to be baptized with His baptism and to drink of His cup-- he only
   asks to share with Jesus in all things. As a good writer says, it
   reminds one of the courage of the Roman who, when Rome was in the hands
   of the enemy, purchased a house within the walls. John heroically asks
   for a throne at the side of One who was about to die on the Cross, for
   he feels sure that He will triumph!

   When the cause and kingdom of Christ seemed ready to expire, yet so
   whole-hearted was John in his faith in God and his love to his beloved
   Lord that his highest ambition was still to be with Jesus and take
   shares with Him in all that He would do and be. So, you see, all
   through John loved his Lord with all his heart and, therefore, Jesus
   Christ loved him. Or let me turn it the other way--the Lord loved John
   and, therefore, John loved the Lord Jesus. It is John's own explanation
   of it--"We love Him because He first loved us." I must ask you to look
   at John, once more, as an instructed person. He was a beloved disciple
   and remained a disciple, but he grew to know more and more and, in that
   capacity I would say of him that doubtless our Lord Jesus loved him
   because of the tenderness which was produced by Grace out of his
   natural warmth.

   How tender he was to Peter, after that Apostle's grievous fall, for
   early in the morning John goes with him to the sepulcher. He is the man
   who restored the backslider. He was so tender that our Lord did not say
   to John, "Feed My lambs," for He knew he would be sure to do it. And He
   did not even say to him, "Feed My sheep," as He did to Peter-- He knew
   that John would do so from the instincts of his loving nature. He was a
   man who, under the tutorship of Christ, grew, moreover, to be very
   spiritual and very deep. The words he uses in his Epistles are mostly
   monosyllables, but what mighty meanings they contain! If we may compare
   one Inspired writer with another, I should say that no other Evangelist
   is at all comparable to John in depth.

   The other evangelists give us Christ's miracles and certain of His
   sermons, but His profound discourses and His matchless prayer are
   reserved for that disciple whom Jesus loved. Where the deep things of
   God are concerned, there is John, with sublime simplicity of utterance,
   declaring unto us the things which he has tasted and handled. Of all
   the disciples John was most Christ-like. Like will gravitate to like.
   Jesus loved John for what He saw of Himself in him--created by His
   Grace. Thus I think you will see that, without supposing John to have
   possessed any merit, there were points in his personal character, in
   his character as a disciple and in his character as an educated,
   spiritual man which justified our Savior in making him the object of
   His most intimate affection.

   III. Very briefly, in the third place, LET US REVIEW THE LIFE WHICH
   GREW OUT OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY LOVE OF CHRIST. What was the life of
   John? First, it was a life of intimate communion. John was wherever
   Christ was. Other disciples are away, but Peter and James and John are
   present. When all the disciples sit at the table, even Peter is not
   nearest to the Lord Jesus, but John leans his head upon His bosom.
   Their communion was very near and dear. Jesus and John were David and
   Jonathan over again. If you are a man greatly beloved you will live in
   Jesus, your fellowship will be with Him from day to day.

   John's was a life of special instruction. He was taught things which no
   others knew, for they could not bear them. At the latter end of his
   life he was favored with visions such as even Paul, himself, though not
   a whit behind the chief of the Apostles, had never seen. Because of the
   greatness of his Lord's love to him, He showed him future things and
   lifted up the veil so that he might see the Kingdom and the Glory. They
   shall see most who love most. They shall be taught most who most
   completely give up their hearts to the doctrine. John, therefore,
   became a man in whose life there was amazing depth. If he did not say
   much as a rule while his Lord was with him, he was taking it all in for
   future use. He lived an inner life. He was a son of thunder and could
   boldly thunder out the Truth of God because, as a thundercloud is
   charged with electricity, so had he gathered up the mysterious force of
   his Lord's life, love and truth.

   When he did break out, there was a voice like the voice of God in
   him--a deep, mysterious, overwhelming power of God was about him. What
   a flash of lightning is the Apocalypse! What awful thunders sleep
   within the vials and the trumpets! His was a life of Divine power
   because of the great fire which burned within. His was not the flash of
   crackling thorns beneath a pot, but the glow of coals in a furnace when
   the whole mass is molten into a white heat. John is the ruby among the
   twelve--he shines with a warm brilliance reflecting the love which
   Jesus lavished on him. And his life was one of special usefulness. He
   was entrusted with choice commissions involving high honor. The Lord
   gave him to do a work of the most tender and delicate kind which, I am
   afraid, He could not commit to some of us.

   As the Redeemer hung upon the tree dying, He saw His mother standing in
   the throng and He did not commit her to Peter, but to John. Peter would
   have been glad of the commission, I am sure, and so would Thomas and so
   would James--but the Lord said to John, "Behold your mother!" And to
   His mother, "Woman, behold your son!" And from that hour that disciple
   took her to his own home. So modest, so retiring--I was going to say,
   so gentlemanly--was John that he was the man to take charge of a
   broken-hearted mother. Said I wrong that he was a true gentleman?
   Divide the word and surely he was the gentlest of men. John has a
   delicate air and considerate manner, necessary to the care of an
   honored woman. Peter is good, but he is rough. Thomas is kind, but
   cold. John is tender and affectionate.

   When you love Jesus much, He will trust His mother to you--I mean His
   Church--and the poorest people in it, such as widows and orphans and
   poor ministers. He will trust them to you because He loves you much. He
   will not put everybody into that office. Some of His people are very
   hard and stony of heart and more fit to be tax-collectors than
   distributors of alms. They would make capital officers in an army, but
   not nurses in a hospital. If you love Jesus much, you shall have many
   delicate offices to perform which shall be to you proofs of your Lord's
   trust in you and renewed tokens of His love. John's life was, moreover,
   one of extraordinary heavenliness. They call him John the Divine and he
   was so. His eagle wings bore him aloft into the heavenly places and
   there he beheld the Glory of the Lord.

   Whether in Jerusalem or in Antioch, in Ephesus or in Patmos, his
   conversation was in Heaven! The Lord's Day found him in the spirit,
   waiting for Him that comes with clouds--so waiting that He who is the
   Alpha and Omega hastened to reveal Himself to him. It was the love of
   his Lord which had thus prepared him for visions of the Glory. Had not
   that love so enkindled his own love as to hold him faithfully at the
   Cross all through the agony, he might never have been able to gaze upon
   the Truth of God. He had lovingly followed Him who had been pointed out
   to Him as the "Lamb of God" and, therefore, he was made meet to see Him
   as the Lamb in the midst of the Throne--adored of angels and re-

   deemed saints, whose harps and viols are engrossed with His praise! O
   that we, too, could be freed from the grossness of earth and borne
   aloft into the purer atmosphere of spiritual and heavenly things!

   IV. We close by saying, very briefly, LET US LEARN LESSONS FOR
   OURSELVES from that disciple whom Jesus loved. May the Holy Spirit
   speak them to our inmost hearts. First, I speak to those of you who are
   still young. If you wish to be "the disciple whom Jesus loved" begin
   soon. I suppose that John was between 20 and 25 when he was converted.
   At any rate, he was quite a young man. All the representations of him
   which have been handed down to us, though I attach no great value to
   them, yet unite in the fact of his youth. Youthful piety has the most
   profitable opportunity of becoming eminent piety.

   If you begin, soon, to walk with Christ, you will improve your pace and
   the habit will grow upon you. He who is only made a Christian in the
   last few years of his life will scarcely reach to the first and highest
   degree for lack of time and from the hampering influence of old habits.
   But you who begin soon are planted in good soil with a sunny aspect and
   should come to maturity. Soldiers who enlist early under the banner of
   our David have hope of becoming veterans and attaining to the first
   three.

   Next, if we would be like John in being loved by Christ, let us give
   our heart's best thoughts to spiritual things. Brothers and Sisters, do
   not stop in the outward ordinances but plunge into their inner sense.
   Never allow your soul, on the Lord's Day for instance, to be thankful
   and happy merely because you have been to the place of worship. Ask
   yourself, "Did I worship? Did my soul commune with God?" In the use of
   the two ordinances of Baptism and the Lord's Supper, content not
   yourself with the shell, but seek to get at the kernel of their inner
   meaning. Rest not unless the Spirit of God, Himself, dwells within you.
   Remember that the letter kills--it is the spirit that gives life. The
   Lord Jesus Christ takes no delight in those who are fond of broad
   phylacteries and multiplied sacraments and holy performances and
   superstitious observances. The Father seeks those to worship Him who
   worship Him in spirit and in truth. Be spiritual and you are among
   those who are likely to be men greatly beloved.

   Next to that, cherish a holy warmth. Do not repress your emotions and
   freeze your souls. You know the class of people who are gifted with
   refrigerating power. When you shake hands with them, you would think
   that you had hold of a fish--a chill goes to your very soul! Listen to
   them sing. No, you cannot hear them! Sit in the next pew and you will
   never hear the gentle hiss or mutter which they call singing. Out in
   their shops they could be heard a quarter of a mile off, but if they
   pray in the Prayer Meeting, you must strain your ears. They do all
   Christian service as if they were working by the day for a bad master
   and at scanty wages. But when they get into the world they work by the
   piece as if for dear life. Such people cannot be affectionate.

   They never encourage a young convert, for they are afraid that their
   weighty commendation might exalt him above measure. A little
   encouragement would help the struggling youth mightily, but they have
   none to offer. They calculate and reckon and move prudently and
   anything like a brave trust in God they set down as rashness and folly.
   God grant us plenty of rashness, I say, for what men think imprudence
   is about the grandest thing under Heaven! Enthusiasm is a feeling which
   these refrigerators do not indulge. Their chant is, "As it was in the
   beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end. Amen!" Anything
   like a dash for Christ and a rush for souls they do not understand.
   Mark this, if you follow such people home, you will find that they have
   little joy, themselves, and make very little joy for others. They are
   never quite certain that they are saved and if they are not sure of it
   we may readily guess that other people are not.

   They spend, in anxious thought, the strength which ought to have gone
   in hearty love. They were born at the north pole and live amid
   perpetual frost--all the furs of Hudson's Bay could not warm them.
   About them you see none of the rich tropical flowers which bedeck the
   heart upon which the Sun of Righteousness shines with perpendicular
   beams. These chilly mortals have never traversed the sunny regions of
   heavenly love where the spices of holy delight load all the air and
   apples of gold are everywhere within the reach of glowing hearts. The
   Lord bring us there! Jesus Christ loves warm people! He never shines on
   an iceberg except to melt it. His own life is so full of love that its
   holy fire kindles the same flame in others and thus He has fellowship
   with those whose hearts burn within them.

   The fitness for love is love. To enjoy the love of Jesus we must
   overflow with love. Pray for earnest, eager, intense affection. Lay
   your hearts among the coals of juniper till they melt and glow. Dear
   Brothers and Sisters, if you want to be the man or woman that Jesus
   loves, cultivate strong affection and let your nature be tender and
   kind. One who is habitually cross and frequently angry cannot walk with
   God. A person of a quick, hot temper who never tries to check it, or

   in whom there is a malicious remembrance of injuries, like a fire
   smoldering amidst the embers, cannot be the companion and friend of
   Jesus whose spirit is of an opposite character! A pitiful,
   compassionate, unselfish, generous heart is that which our Lord
   approves. Forgive your fellow as if you never had anything to forgive.
   When Brethren injure you, hope that they have made a mistake, or else
   feel that if they knew you better they would treat you worse! Be of
   such a mind towards them that you will neither give nor take offense.
   Be willing to lay down, not only your comfort, but even your life for
   the Brethren! Live in the joy of others, even as saints do in Heaven.
   Love others so as to forget your own sorrows. So shall you become a man
   greatly beloved.

   Last of all, may the Spirit of God help you to rise to heavenliness. Do
   not be miserable money-grubbers, or sordid earthworms. Do not be
   pleasure hunters and novelty seekers. Do not set your affection upon
   these children's toys which will be so soon broken. Be you no more
   children, but men of God! Oh to find your joy in Christ, your wealth in
   Christ, your honor in Christ, your everything in Christ--this is peace.
   To be in the world but not to be of it. To linger here as if you were
   an angel sent from Heaven to dwell, for a while, among the sons of men,
   to tell them of Heaven and point them the way--this is to abide in
   Christ's love.

   To be always ready to fly, to stand on tiptoe waiting for the
   heavenward call, to expect to hear the trumpet ring out its clarion
   note, the trumpet of the coming of your Lord--this is to have
   fellowship with Christ! Sit loose, I pray you, by this world, but get a
   tighter grip of the world to come--so shall Jesus' love be shed abroad
   within you. Throw your anchor upward into the placid sea of Divine Love
   and not like the seamen, downward, into a troubled ocean. Anchor
   yourselves to the eternal Throne and never be divided, even in thought,
   from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. May it be my
   privilege and yours, Brothers and Sisters, to lean these heads of ours
   on Jesus' bosom till the day breaks and the shadows flee away. Amen and
   Amen.

The Mediator--Judge And Savior

   (No. 1540)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 30, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And He commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that it
   is He which was ordained of God to be the Judge of the quick and the
   dead. To Him all the prophets witness that, through His name, whoever
   believes in Him shall receive remission of sins." Acts 10:42,43.

   THESE two verses are an extract from a very remarkable sermon, a sermon
   preached by Peter in the house of Cornelius upon the occasion of the
   Gentile Pentecost. I think we are entitled to call the event by that
   name, for then the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the
   Gentiles. Peter preached at the first Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit
   fell upon the company of Jewish Believers and it is remarkable that he
   should be the preacher at the second Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit
   descended upon those of the uncircumcision while they were listening to
   the Gospel. Philip was at Caesarea and might have been called in, but
   God had determined that the strict Peter, the minister of the
   circumcision, should himself open the door of faith to the Gentiles.

   Paul was, at that time, converted and it might have seemed to be more
   appropriate to have used him in enlightening this Italian officer, but
   the Lord thought not so--He would send the Spirit upon the Gentiles in
   connection with the same person who preached when this visitation
   blessed the converts of Israel. Peter preached, as it were, upon the
   ruins of the middle wall of partition which once divided the sons of
   men. The occasion was very special and hence the sermon is the more
   worthy of our earnest consideration. What kind of discourse is that
   which is likely to be sealed by the Holy Spirit? We may learn something
   upon that point from the instance before us.

   Notice that it was a sermon "preached by request." I have seen those
   words printed upon the title page of very poor sermons--as a sort of
   apology for their being printed. I have wondered who it was that
   requested them and whether the requesters were pleased with what they
   got by their petition. I should think that they would hardly have asked
   that the same words should be spoken to them again. But this request
   was a very honest and hearty one, for Cornelius sent many miles to
   fetch the preacher and the preacher came a long day's journey in order
   to deliver his discourse. It were devoutly to be wished that many such
   sermons would both be preached and published by request. When men are
   anxious to hear such discourses and count the preacher to be their
   benefactor, there is every hope that the Truth of God will work their
   salvation.

   This discourse was delivered to a model congregation. One might be
   satisfied to preach in the middle of the night to such an assembly, for
   a devout family had come together at the earnest request of a leading
   kinsman to have the Gospel preached to them. To that assembly not a
   single person came in late--everyone was there before the speaker
   arrived. Late attendance frequently means heartless worship,
   disturbance and distraction. "Now, therefore," said Cornelius before
   Peter began, "we are all here present before God." This was well--O
   that all hearers were punctual, that all worship might be undisturbed!
   Better, still, would it be if all our audiences felt that they were
   "before God"--this would create a solemn feeling and ensure devout
   attention.

   The hearers were all in a waiting and expectant mood and all in a
   receptive condition, desiring, as Cornelius said, "to hear all things
   that are commanded you of God." Never was the ground better plowed, nor
   in a finer condition for receiving the living Seed. Peter gave them a
   very plain and simple sermon--you cannot find a flourish in it, nor a
   metaphor, nor even the least attempt at oratory as, indeed, you do not
   find in the sermons of Inspired men. Those gentlemen who preach
   grandiloquently are uninspired, you may depend upon that, or else they
   would not attempt their high and mighty style. The Inspiration which
   the Holy Spirit gives, leads men to use great plainness of speech. Not
   in words, only,

   was Peter plain, but the Truths of God which he taught were the first
   principles of the faith and it is generally by these that men are
   saved--points of difficult theology are not often the means of
   conversion.

   What have we to do with the fireworks of rhetoric, or the playthings of
   controversy when men are anxious to know the way of salvation? Simple
   as the discourse was, it was a very powerful one. So powerful, indeed,
   that all that heard it were converted! I do not see any intimation that
   one of them remained unconvinced, for the 44th verse says, "The Holy
   Spirit fell on all them which heard the Word." What a very remarkable
   occasion was this, when all who heard the Truth of God felt the power
   of the Holy Spirit! What would I not give to be enabled to preach after
   that fashion and to see such a result! Peter's sermon, however, was
   never finished--it remains forever a homiletical fragment, a broken
   column of the temple of wisdom, a discourse of which we shall never
   know the conclusion intended by its author.

   I am sure that Peter felt full of matter that day, for so a minister
   usually feels when he knows that he is sent by the Lord, Himself, with
   a special commission and sees a people with open hearts receiving all
   that he utters. He then feels like a vessel needing vent, his heart is
   inditing a good matter, his tongue is the pen of a ready writer. Yet
   the sermon was never finished, but closed abruptly. Oh that our sermons
   were incomplete for the same cause that Peter's was, for the Holy
   Spirit, who speaks better by Himself than by the most earnest voice,
   caused a divinely joyful interruption--"The Holy Spirit fell on all
   them which heard the Word."

   The sermon was stopped while they heard the converts speak with tongues
   and magnify God and the preacher did not return to his sermon but,
   together with his converts, attended to Baptism and then enjoyed holy
   fellowship. Oh that the Spirit of God would, in the same manner,
   interrupt us! We have too much talk and too little of those blessed
   silences which He is sure to cause. It were better for our lips to be
   sealed by the hour than for us to speak except as He opens our mouth to
   show forth the praises of the Lord. A sacred irregularity would be far
   better in our public services than the prim monotony of death. For all
   these reasons I think I have a claim upon your very earnest attention
   while we look at Peter's sermon more intently--surely a sermon produced
   under such circumstances--leading up to such results and interrupted so
   Divinely deserves to be reverently studied!

   What was the subject? What was Peter preaching upon? He was preaching
   Christ and Him Crucified! No other subject ever produces such effects
   as this. The Spirit of God bears no witness to Christless sermons!
   Leave Jesus out of your preaching and the Holy Spirit will never come
   upon you. Why should He? Has He not come on purpose that He may testify
   of Christ? Did not Jesus say, "He shall glorify Me: for He shall
   receive of Me and shall show it unto you"? Yes, the subject was Christ
   and nothing but Christ and such is the teaching which the Spirit of God
   will acknowledge. Be it ours never to wander from this central point!
   May we determine to know nothing among men but Christ and His Cross.

   I think there were six heads in the sermon, though he spoke only of one
   Subject, that is, Christ. The Apostle spoke of the Lord's Person. I
   will not enlarge, but simply give you his words. He said, "Preaching
   peace by Jesus Christ: He is Lord of all." He did not teach the
   Socinian Gospel, which sets forth a Christ who is not God. We love "the
   Man Christ Jesus," but we cannot endure the doctrine that He is no more
   than Man! How could He save us? Could a mere man redeem us? "He is Lord
   of all" and because He is thus supreme, we feel we can trust Him with
   the salvation of our souls. Peter is very clear upon the Sovereign
   Godhead of Jesus. His Words are few, but they are exceedingly explicit.

   Having spoken of His Person, he then spoke of His life and what a pithy
   summary it is--"How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit
   and with power." There was the spring of His life's power--His
   anointing from the Holy Spirit, who bore witness of Him in Jordan and
   at other times. He says, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, for the
   Lord has anointed Me." The tenor of His life is set out in the next
   sentence, "Who went about doing good." That one stroke gives a full
   portrait of Christ! You have summed up, in that sentence, the biography
   of Jesus as He lived among men! He was an itinerant Missionary, a
   traveling Preacher, a general Benefactor and "He went about doing
   good."

   Then Peter passed on to his third point, which was the Savior's death,
   of which he says, "Whom they slew and hanged on a tree." He does not
   take away the offense of the Cross, nor put it in smooth language, as
   some would have done. He confesses that they hanged Him on a tree.
   Hanging or crucifixion was an accursed and shameful death in the
   judgment of all mankind and Peter confesses that His Lord thus
   died--there is no concealing, or even veiling of the matter--he
   acknowledges that He died by hanging upon a tree. I rejoice in this
   bold telling of the Doctrine of the Cross in what some may call its
   boldness, but in what we will regard as its sublime simplicity. In
   Christ's death the shame is honor

   and the disgrace renown--to deck the Cross with flowers and make
   crucifixion honorable is to rob the august transaction of its leading
   element, namely, the endurance of shame because of man's shameful sin.

   Then Peter passed on to our Lord's Resurrection, for that is an
   essential part of the Gospel and the Gospel is not preached where a
   risen Christ is forgotten. "Him God raised up the third day and showed
   Him openly." It was no fiction! He was openly shown on many occasions
   to those best able to recognize Him. The risen Christ was seen and seen
   clearly. Yes, and spoken with and touched with fingers and hands by His
   disciples. He was not shown to all the people, for He was not to be
   exhibited to gratify curiosity, but to secure faith. The evidence of
   500 persons is quite sufficient to the establishment of an historical
   fact and perhaps better for the purpose than the witness of unnumbered
   crowds. If you suppose those 500 to have been deceived, you would just
   as readily believe that a whole nation was mistaken.

   Had the nation of the Jews received the truth of Christ's resurrection
   they could not have given us better evidence than we have, already,
   that Christ is risen! It would have been said--"This is all an
   Israelite fable! The Jewish nation, prejudiced in their own favor, have
   banded together to maintain the fiction of a risen Messiah in order to
   add to their own national reputation." There is something far more
   convincing in the testimony of men who, themselves, were persecuted and
   put to death for bearing such witness and died adhering unanimously to
   the truth of their common testimony. God gave to the whole world
   sufficient evidence to establish the Resurrection of Christ, for many
   did eat and drink with Him after He rose from the dead.

   Then Peter came to the last two points of his sermon, which were the
   judgment, which he felt it necessary to preach--declaring that Jesus
   Christ who died and rose again is now designated the Judge of all
   mankind. And lastly, as the gem of all, Peter preached salvation by the
   Lord Jesus most fully and graciously when he said, "Through His name
   whoever believes in Him shall receive remission of sins." This was what
   he was driving at and when he had reached this point, enough Truth of
   God had been taught to save a soul and God, the Holy Spirit, at once
   used it! I propose, this morning, to confine your attention to those
   last two points of Peter's sermon, for I am sure that there is much
   profitable matter in them. Not that I intend to bring out the meaning
   of each of these verses separately so much as the connection of the
   two, to show how Christ's being made Judge of all mankind has a
   connection with His being the Savior of all those who believe in Him,
   to whom He forgives their sins. May God bless the meditation to our
   souls' profit.

   I. OUR DIVINE MEDIATOR'S POSITION INVOLVES TWO OFFICES. We are not now
   living under the immediate government of God, but under the reign of
   Jesus Christ the Mediator, for God has committed all judgment unto the
   Son. Jesus now reigns, according to the Word of the Psalmist, "You have
   put all things in subjection under His feet." We are living under a
   mediatorial dispensation in which all power is delivered unto Jesus in
   Heaven and in earth. God shines upon us, now, through the Person of His
   dear Son and not, therefore, with those fierce and strong beams which
   in justice would have consumed us, but through the medium of the
   accepted Person of Jesus--with mild, soft, genial radiance for our
   comfort and our salvation.

   Inasmuch as Christ has thus received mediatorial power in its fullness,
   there are two offices in it. The first is that of Judge and the second
   is that of Savior. First, Jesus Christ as Mediator has become our
   Judge. "The Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment unto
   the Son." "To this end Christ both died and rose and revived, that He
   might be Lord both of the dead and the living, for we shall all stand
   before the judgment seat of Christ." Mark that--"of Christ." Jesus of
   Nazareth has become "Judge of the quick and the dead." In this capacity
   He has judicial authority over all mankind. Offenses now are offenses
   against Him--transgressions against the royal Son of God. He has
   authority over men and He will try all of us at the Last Day, as He is,
   even now, sitting in judgment upon all our acts and thoughts and
   intents.

   We shall all have to stand before Him, "that everyone may receive the
   things done in the body, according to that he has done, whether it is
   good or bad." He will sum up the evidence and decide the doom of all.
   We shall, each one, appear before His Great White Throne and He shall
   divide the nations as a shepherd divides the sheep from the goats. If
   any are condemned, His lips shall say, "Depart, you cursed!" If any are
   glorified, from His lips shall proceed the sentence, "Come, you blessed
   of My Father and inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
   foundation of the world." Yes, He that hung upon the Cross sits now as
   King upon the holy hill of Zion and He must reign till all His enemies
   are made His footstool and He must come a second time without a
   sin-offering unto the judgment of mankind.

   That judgment of our Savior's will be authoritative and final and it
   will concern all the race of Adam. It is of Divine appointing and can
   never be questioned, for God "has appointed a day in the which He will
   judge the world in righteousness by that Man whom He has ordained;
   whereof He has given assurance unto all men, in that He has raised Him
   from the dead." The Lord Jesus is Judge of the quick, that is, of the
   living and of the dead. All that will be alive at His coming, kings and
   peasants, professing saints and avowed sinners must, alike, stand
   before His Throne. And all the myriads whose moldering bodies have
   turned the world into one huge graveyard must live again and all answer
   to His trumpet summons.

   The Jews that accused Him; the Romans that executed Him; the ancient
   Gentiles that persecuted His Apostles; the scoffers of modern times who
   ridicule His claims--all kings and patriarchs before the flood with all
   the numerous host destroyed by the deluge and the myriads upon myriads
   of all the nations that have come and gone since then and all that
   shall come and shall yet go--all must, without exception, put in a
   personal appearance before the bar of the Nazarene, who is also the Son
   of God! This is part of His work as Mediator between God and man and
   well will He discharge the solemn trust.

   The second part of His office is to be a Savior, "that through His name
   whoever believes in Him should receive remission of sins." He is a
   Prince and a Savior! Power in Him attends His Grace. He has the
   sovereign right of condemnation or justification--the final judgment is
   with Him. He says, "Behold I come quickly and My reward is with Me to
   give every man according as his work shall be." The powers of life and
   death are entrusted to Jehovah Jesus, the Son of God. He has authority
   to pass by transgression, iniquity and sin in His own name, as in the
   name of the Eternal God. His Atonement has made it possible for Him to
   do this in perfect consistency with His Character as Judge. He pardons
   and when He pardons it is as just an act as when He condemns.

   If this seem a paradox to you, read the New Testament and see how He
   can be just and yet the Justifier of him that believes. See how it is
   that in the atoning Sacrifice, "righteousness and peace have kissed
   each other," and how God is severely just in all that He does and yet
   abounds towards Believers in richness of Grace in passing by their sin.
   It seems to me to be a very blessed thought that the same universality
   which pervades the Mediator's dignified proceedings as Judge is to be
   seen in His condescending operations as Savior, for it is not to the
   Jews, alone, that He has come, though to them He is preached. Would God
   they did receive Him, but He is come to the Gentiles, also, that
   "whoever believes in Him shall receive remission of sins."

   Now, there is neither black nor white, male nor female, rich nor poor
   with Him--humanity is one great fallen family and out of it shall arise
   a great restored family who come and trust the Savior! Jesus Christ is
   able to save to the uttermost all them that come unto God by Him. As
   well of the ages past was He the Savior of Believers and of this age
   and of ages yet to come. He is mighty always to save--the anointed
   Savior, yesterday, today and forever the same. See you then, because
   Christ is the Interposer and has intervened between God and man and has
   royal authority to so do, He therefore takes upon Himself the double
   work of judging and of pardoning. Let the two works dwell together in
   your minds--

   "He is a just God and a Savior."

   II. Kindly follow me in the next consideration--BOTH THESE OFFICES
   REGARD MEN AS SINNERS. I am sick to death of hearing men talk about the
   goodness which is latent in human nature. I read, the other day, an
   instruction to missionaries that when they go to a foreign land they
   should always believe that men are good, that there is a natural
   religiousness in them, which, like sparks in the embers, only needs
   blowing up a little and will certainly flame up into a wonderful fire
   of true devotion and so on. Pooh! There is not a word of the Truth of
   God in all this flattery! No doctrine could be more untrue to the very
   existence of Christ! If natural religion would have sufficed, why need
   a Divine Savior to have descended among us? The best that the light of
   Nature can do falls short of righteousness.

   The case of Cornelius in the chapter we have been reading makes it
   evident that the best natural religion needs to be illuminated by
   Revelation and instructed by the Doctrine of the Cross, for there is
   Cornelius, a man worshipping the true God devoutly and living correctly
   and yet what must be done for him? Is he to be saved without Christ? Is
   he to find his own way to Eternal Life by the development of his good
   qualities? No, but he must be told to fetch Peter to tell him about
   Jesus, the Savior, and if no other means will answer, an angel must
   descend to guide him to the appointed teacher! When he had gone as far
   as he could go, it became essential that he should hear the Gospel of
   Jesus Christ!

   Now, it is clear as noonday that if for this best of cases the Gospel
   was absolutely necessary, it must assuredly be required by the myriads
   who are not so excellent. Brothers and Sisters, Jesus Christ comes to
   judge mankind because there are sinners to be judged! If you find me a
   nation which has no tribunals, no punishments, no courts of justice, no
   judges--it must either be the scene of utter anarchy or else a nation
   where all obey the law and such a thing as a criminal is unknown! The
   setting up of the last great assize and the making of that assize to
   have reference to all men, the quick and the dead and the appointment
   of the most supreme Person in existence, even the Son of God, to
   conduct that assize--all these facts imply guilt somewhere and
   abundance of it! If it is not thereby proved that every one of the
   quick and the dead have offended, it at least implies that they are all
   under suspicion! But that they are all actually guilty we learn from
   other portions of God's Word. The judgment held by the Mediator is
   proof that the mediatorial office has reference to sin and deals with
   men as transgressors of the Law of God.

   The second part of our Lord's mediatorial office implies this most
   certainly, for He comes as Savior and such an office would be needless
   if there were no sin and ruin. It is idle to talk of saving those who
   have never fallen. He comes to remit sin, but there can be no remission
   of sins to those who have never transgressed. The largeness of the
   promise here used that, "whoever believes in Him shall receive
   remission of sins," goes to prove that there is sin in everybody.
   However wide the, "whoever," is, it is wide, depend upon it. The remedy
   measures the disease. Remission is promised upon belief in Jesus Christ
   because fallen man needs to be pardoned. Putting the two things
   together, the very fact that there is a Mediator at all regards man as
   fallen.

   God could have dealt with us immediately, without an Intercessor had we
   been as the first Adam was before the Fall. It is by reason of sin's
   influence upon the race, the Fall and corruption of the progeny of
   Adam, that it became necessary there should be a "Daysman that might
   lay His hand upon both" and deal with God in His Divine Person and yet
   deal with fallen man in his humanity. Yes, Christ as Mediator deals
   with sinners on God's behalf and the point I want you practically to
   note is this--do not let us get away from the consciousness of being
   sinners because we must then move away from Christ the Mediator! In
   proportion as you set up any righteousness of your own, in that
   proportion you become independent of the Savior and are divided from
   Him.

   If you deny that you are liable to be judged and condemned, you will
   deny, also, the necessity of your being forgiven--and while denying
   your guilt you never can be forgiven--for confession of guilt is a
   necessary preliminary to pardon. "If we confess our sins, He is
   faithful and just to forgive us our sins." Put yourselves, then, with
   broken hearts, beneath the cover of the Savior's wings! Come and stand
   before His majestic Judgment Seat and plead guilty! Then and there cry,
   "Remit my sin through Your great Sacrifice and precious blood." Do not
   try to disprove the accusation or to extenuate the guilt, but plead
   guilty and, as guilty, beg for a free pardon. Do not labor against your
   conscience to deny your sin, but take the publican's place and cry,
   "God, be merciful to me a sinner!"

   That is the second point of the text and it is clear enough. May we be
   wise enough to put it into practice. May the Holy Spirit work in us a
   tender, humble and contrite spirit.

   III. Notice a third consideration--THE QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRED BY OUR
   LORD AS MEDIATOR TO

   FULFILL HIS FIRST OFFICE OF JUDGE MATERIALLY COMFORT US IN LOOKING AT
   HIM UNDER HIS

   SECOND OFFICE AS SAVIOR. Note, then, first, that as Judge, the Lord
   Jesus has full authority. He is fully commissioned of God to acquit or
   to condemn. Oh, then, if He gives me pardon through His blood, it is an
   authorized pardon! It is a free pardon under the King's own hand and
   seal! I rejoice to think of this. If Jesus the Judge had said, "Depart,
   you cursed," I should be certain that it was true and sure though I
   sank into unutterable despair forever.

   And even so, when He says, "I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your
   transgressions and, as a cloud, your sins," I am equally certain that
   His sentence is sure and fixed. Therefore, being justified by such a
   Justifier, we have peace with God through Jesus Christ our Lord! The
   pardon is as authorized as the condemnation would have been. Is not
   this sweet to think about? Is not this a solid pillar for hope to rest
   upon? In order that our Lord might be a competent Judge, He possesses
   the amplest knowledge. A judge should be the most instructed among men,
   or otherwise he is not fit to decide in matters of great difficulty and
   importance. Jesus Christ as Judge is incomparably fit to judge men, for
   He knows men thoroughly. He is, Himself, a Man and, therefore, He knows
   our temptations and our weaknesses. In fact, He knows all about us by
   experience as well as by observation. He carries a man's heart within
   Him to the Judgment Seat and in man's Nature He sits there to weigh us
   in the balances of the Truths of God. This fits Him to judge the world
   with equity.

   Next, He knows the Law. Has He not said, "Yes, Your Law is within My
   heart"? No one knows the Law of God as Jesus did, for He kept it in
   every point--He did not merely read it and learn it, but obeyed it to
   the fullest. The Law is written out in living characters in His holy
   life and obedient death. How qualified He is to judge, since He is
   Master of every line in the royal statute book! Moreover, He knows what
   sin is--not that He ever sinned--but He has lived among sinners as a
   Physician and studied their complaints, making a specialty of the
   disease of sin. Though He had no sin of His own, yet all sin was laid
   on Him. "He was made sin for us, that we might be made the
   righteousness of God in Him."

   The Lord Jesus also knows the punishment of sin. A judge must know what
   penalties to award. Jesus knows this well enough, for He, Himself, has
   once suffered for sin, the Just for the unjust, to bring us to God. He
   knows the deserved penalty of human guilt, for on His shoulders the
   plowers made deep furrows and His very soul was crushed within Him in
   the winepress of Divine Wrath. Pause here and think awhile. Inasmuch as
   this knowledge qualifies Christ to be your Judge, O my Soul, it equally
   qualifies Him to pardon you, for He knows you thoroughly and can
   cleanse you thoroughly! He knows sin, dear Brothers and Sisters--your
   sin and mine--so that when He gives pardon it will be for all our sin.
   He will forgive all manner of transgressions, iniquities and crimes of
   which all are open before Him.

   He knows the Law and, therefore, He knows how legally to acquit, so
   that no further question can be raised. He will make no mistake about
   the matter, for He knows the ways of the courts of Heaven. Since He
   knows the penalty--because He has borne it all--He will take care that
   none of it shall ever fall on us. The pardon of Believers is not given
   by a blind God, nor granted in error--there are no flaws in the Divine
   Judgment--no schemes and quibbles by which to evade the meaning of the
   statute in that case made and provided, but all is done in justice and
   equity. The Lord does not keep to the ear that which is avoided in
   fact, but all His judgments are done in truth. The Judge of all the
   earth must do right. If You have pardoned me, my Lord, You have known
   what You have done and You have done it thoroughly and well and wisely
   and it will stand in the highest court against all gainsayers!

   I shall not be condemned when I am judged, but shall be cleared and
   justified even before the bar of God, for Jesus Christ, the Judge,
   Himself, has put away my sin! See here the full remission granted to my
   faith. Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect since God
   has justified? Do you see this? Do you not also see, dear Friends, that
   all the personal qualifications of our Lord to act as Judge, remarkably
   tend to make the pardon of His people the more blessedly clear for,
   first of all, as a Judge He is very just. "You love righteousness and
   hate wickedness, therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil
   of gladness above Your fellows." "He is called Faithful and True and in
   righteousness He does judge and make war."

   He is impartial and unchanging and sitting on the Judgment Seat the
   highest and noblest qualities of humanity and Deity are conspicuous in
   Him. Well, then, when He forgives it must be just to forgive and when
   He pardons us it must be consistent with the holiness of God for us to
   be pardoned! Such an One as He whom God accounts worthy to judge the
   sons of men at the Last Great Day, when He says, "your sins are
   forgiven you," has not perverted judgment, nor turned aside from right.
   Our pardon is affirmed and established by the Wisdom and Truth of the
   Divine Judge and its authenticity and correctness are proven by the
   same attributes. Who can dispute our acquittal since it comes from the
   Judge Himself?

   If you have caught my thought and seen the Truth of God, it must tend
   to your comfort and delight--all the pomp of judgment, all the
   authority of the Throne, all the justice of the statute book, all the
   power of the mediatorial government and all the holiness of the Judge,
   Himself, are engaged to maintain the verdict of His Grace and make it
   as firm as the sentence of His wrath. Herein is ground for quiet
   assurance.

   IV. Let us next notice the fact that OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FIRST OFFICE
   OF THE MEDIATOR IS EXCEEDINGLY NECESSARY TO OUR ACCEPTANCE OF HIM IN
   HIS SECOND CAPACITY. This was why Peter

   preached it. This was why Paul before Felix reasoned concerning
   righteousness, temperance and judgment to come. This is why the Holy
   Spirit, Himself, convinces the world of sin, of righteousness and of
   judgment. Dear Hearer, if you do not believe in Christ as your Judge,
   you will never accept Him as your Savior! Unless you set yourself
   before that awful Throne, that Great White Throne, as John calls it,
   and realize yourself as standing there to give an account of your sins,
   you will not fly to the Savior for mercy!

   I would have every unconverted person set before his mind the hour of
   his death, the moment of the appearance of his naked spirit before the
   tribunal of Christ and then the resurrection and the solemnities of
   that great day for which all

   other days are made, when Heaven and earth shall pass away and all
   things melt like dreams and the only real thing shall be the man, his
   deeds, his Judge, his future. Oh, think of this! Some of you are
   unpardoned this morning and as sure as you live, unless you repent, you
   will stand before God to receive nothing but condemnation--condemnation
   irreversible and eternal! Let those who would bewitch you say what they
   will, you will receive a condemnation which will thunder after you
   throughout ages without end! It will wither all your hopes and dry up
   the springs of comfort within your nature and leave you in eternal
   desolation!

   I cannot speak upon this topic at any length, the theme is too
   dreadful. May none of you ever incur the doom of the Last Day. May it
   never happen that one who sat in the Tabernacle while we tried to
   preach the Gospel shall be driven by the whirlwind of Divine Justice
   away from the Presence of God and the glory of His power! And yet it
   will be so with some of you, I am afraid, for you do not turn to God.
   You do not seek the Savior and you are as likely as not to die in your
   sins and, if you do, "there remains no more sacrifice for sin, but a
   fearful looking for of judgment and of fiery indignation" which must
   devour you. Oh that you would feel this and now, under a sense of it,
   come and trust in Jesus Christ the Savior!

   He is never dear to any but to sinners. Christ is never valued by any
   but the guilty. He came into the world to save sinners--it is well He
   did, for no one else will have Him but those who feel their sin and
   condemnation. Oh, come and take Him as your Savior and let that blessed
   word, "Whoever believes in Him," be like a wide door to let you in!
   "Whoever believes in Him shall receive remission of sins." Why should
   you not, at this moment, obtain that full remission? Here are some
   lines which I would have you think upon when you are in your own
   chambers at home--may their concluding prayer be yours--

   "That day of wrath, that dreadful day, When Hea ven and earth shall
   pass away, What power shall be the sinner's stay! How shall he meet
   that dreadful day, When, shriveling like a parched scroll, The flaming
   heavens together roll? When louder yet and yet more dread, Swells the
   high trumpet that wakes the dead? O, on that day, that wrathful day
   When man to judgment wakes from clay, Be YOU the trembling sinner's
   stay, Though Hea ven and earth shall pass away!" V. The last
   Observation is that THE SAVING WORK OF CHRIST'S MEDIATORIAL OFFICE IS
   THAT WHICH

   CONCERNS US MOST AT THIS PRESENT TIME. What does Jesus do as Mediator?
   He judges, but He also forgives.

   Note the words, "Shall receive remission of sins." What is remission of
   sin? Hear it and be astonished that it is possible! It is the causing
   of sin to cease to be! Granted that you have sinned--lamented that you
   have sinned. Granted, also, that your sin deserves the utmost
   punishment, yet God, in wondrous mercy, is prepared to forget your sin,
   to blot it out, to cast it behind His back, to cast it into the depths
   of the sea! Many Scriptural expressions go to set forth that He will
   put it quite away so that He will regard you as if you had never
   offended at all.

   Guilty man, do you hear this? You that are not guilty--you
   self-righteous people--I do not care whether you hear it or not, for
   Christ did not come to call you since the whole have no need of a
   physician, but O, you guilty ones who know that you are guilty, listen
   to this! There is remission and it is preached to you in Jesus Christ's
   name! God is a God of mercy and He passes by iniquity, transgression
   and sin and the guilty can be justly treated by Him as if they were
   perfectly innocent! Note this grand fact and then observe that this is
   to be done in Christ's name! There is no other name in which pardon can
   be bestowed--but it can come in the name of Jesus! Without shedding of
   blood there is no remission and this blood is the blood of Jesus
   Christ, God's dear Son, which cleanses us from all sin.

   It is in the name of Jesus, the Nazarene--despised and rejected of men,
   who is also Lord of all--it is in His name that pardon is freely
   presented to the most guilty of the human race! Be they where they may,
   God is ready to kiss away their sins and to accept them through Jesus
   Christ. According to the text this is to be had through faith, for the
   text says, "He that believes on Him." The plan is very simple. Every
   great discovery is very simple when it is complete. Did you ever

   notice that when a machine is complicated you feel sure that it is only
   in its infancy? The more perfect it becomes the more simple it becomes
   till, at last, when there is no improvement to be made, you can see it
   is so because all complications have been removed. Such is the Gospel.
   It is not a science which needs to be learned at universities. It is
   not a mysterious doctrine which needs the intellect of a doctor of
   divinity to grasp it. It is just an A B C Gospel which babes often
   receive when wise men miss it. It is--trust Jesus Christ--trust God in
   Jesus Christ and you are reconciled to Him and your sins are blotted
   out for Christ's sake!

   Lastly, this blessed news has reference to everyone in the whole world
   that will believe in Jesus. That great, comprehensive word, "whoever,"
   is worthy of your devout notice. "Whoever believes in Him." This
   excludes no race of men, neither the most degraded Hottentot, nor the
   most intellectual Hindu. This shuts out no king and no beggar, no
   moralist and no whoremonger, no adulterer, no swearer, no thief, no
   murderer! Blessed be the God of all Grace, it does not shut out me! I
   greatly rejoice in this. I am one of the "whoevers," for I believe in
   Jesus with all my heart! I have no hope but in Him and, therefore, I
   know that I have remission of my sins. I long for you all to have it,
   too--not because of any merits of yours; not because of any feelings of
   yours; not because of any works of yours--but for His dear sake who was
   hanged on a tree you shall have remission if you believe in Him!

   Oh, trust Him! Trust Him and you shall have pardon! My heart longs that
   you should, at this moment, accept Jesus and live. Why not? Often, when
   we have spoken like this, the Holy Spirit has cheered the hearts of men
   and brought them to Christ and why should He not do it this morning?
   Pray for it, Believers! This moment offer your intense prayers to
   Heaven in silent cries. The Spirit of God is here in this assembly and
   He will work in answer to our warm desires. I have preached the Gospel.
   I know it is the very Gospel of the blessed God! Will He not bear
   witness to His own Truth? Has He not pledged Himself to do it? I have
   preached His Truth as well as I can, relying only upon His help and I
   have earnestly avoided all tawdry speech of human wisdom. I have told
   you in all simplicity the old, old story of my blessed Lord and
   therefore I confidently expect to see the Word prosper.

   The Holy Spirit must bless the preaching of the Cross--it is His
   office, His Nature, His usual way to do so. He has not changed, nor
   ceased to be what He used to be and, therefore, He will bless His
   people and make His Gospel the power of God unto salvation! O my dear
   Hearer, seize the blessing by an instant faith! God help you to do it,
   for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.

Unprofitable Servants

   (No. 1541)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 6, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And cast you the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall
   be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Matthew 25:30.

   "So likewise you, when you shall have done all those things which are
   commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we ha ve done that
   which was our duty to do."

   Luke 17:10.

   "His lord said unto him, Well done, you good and faithful servant."

   Matthew 25:21.

   THERE is a narrow path between indifference and morbid sensibility.
   Some men seem to feel no holy anxiety--they place their Master's talent
   in the earth, leave it there and take their pleasure and their ease
   without a moment's compunction. Others profess to be so anxious to be
   right that they come to the conclusion that they can never be so and
   fall under a horror of God, viewing His service as a drudgery and
   Himself as a hard master--though probably they never say so. Between
   these two lines there is a path, narrow as a razor's edge, which only
   the Grace of God can enable us to trace. It is free from carelessness
   and from bondage and consists in a sense of responsibility bravely
   borne by the help of the Holy Spirit.

   The right way usually lies between two extremes--it is the narrow
   channel between the rock and the whirlpool. There is a sacred way which
   runs between self-congratulation and despondency which is a very
   difficult track to find and very hard to keep. There are great perils
   in the consciousness that you have done well and that you are serving
   God with all your might, for you may come to think that you are a
   deserving person, worthy to rank among the princes of Israel. The
   danger of being puffed up can hardly be overestimated--a dizzy head
   soon brings a fall. But perhaps equally to be dreaded, on the other
   side, is that sense of unworthiness which paralyzes all exertion making
   you feel that you are incapable of anything that is great or good.

   Under this impulse have men fled from the service of God into a life of
   solitude. They felt that they could not behave valiantly in the battle
   of life and, therefore, they fled from the field before the fight
   began--to become hermits or monks--as if it were possible to do the
   Lord's perfect will by doing nothing at all and to discharge the duties
   to which they were born by an unnatural mode of existence! Blessed is
   that man who finds the straight and narrow way between high thoughts of
   self and hard thoughts of God, between self-esteem and a timid
   shrinking from all effort. My desire is that the Spirit of God may
   guide our minds into the golden median where holy Graces blend and the
   contending vices, equally natural to our evil hearts, are all excluded.

   May the Spirit of God bless our three texts and the three subjects
   suggested by them, so that we may be put right and then, by infinite
   mercy, may be kept right until the great day of account. Let us read
   Matthew 25:30. "And cast you the unprofitable servant into outer
   darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

   I. In this, our first text, we have THE VERDICT OF JUSTICE upon the man
   who did not use his talent. The man is here styled an "unprofitable
   servant " because he was slothful, useless, worthless. He did not bring
   his master interest for his money nor render him any sincere service.
   He did not faithfully discharge the trust reposed in him as his fellow
   servants did. Notice, first, that this unprofitable person was a
   servant. He never denied that he was a servant. In fact, it was by his
   position as a servant that he became possessed of his one talent and to
   that possession he never objected.

   If He had been capable of receiving more, there is no reason why he
   should not have had two talents, or five, for the Scripture tells us
   that the master gave to every man according to his ability. He
   acknowledged the rule of his master even

   in the act of burying the talent and in appearing before him to give an
   account. This makes the subject the more heart-searching for you and
   for me, for we, too, profess to be servants--servants of the Lord our
   God. Judgment must begin at the house of God, that is, with those who
   are in the house of the Lord as children and servants. Let us,
   therefore, look well to our actions.

   If judgment first begins with us, "what shall be the end of them that
   obey not the Gospel of God?" "If the righteous are scarcely saved,
   where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?" If this in our text is
   judgment upon servants, what will be the judgment upon enemies? This
   man acknowledged that he was a servant even to the last. And though he
   was impertinent and impudent enough to express a most wicked and
   slanderous opinion about his master, yet he neither denied his own
   position as a servant, nor the fact that his talent was his lord's, for
   he said, "Lo, there you have what is yours."

   In thus speaking he went rather further than some professing Christians
   do, for they live as if Christianity were all eating the fat and
   drinking the sweet and not serving at all--as if religion had many
   privileges but no precepts and, as if, when men were saved, they became
   licensed loiterers to whom it is a matter of honor to magnify Free
   Grace by standing idle all day in the market place. Alas, I know some
   who never do a hand's turn for Christ and yet call Him Master and Lord!
   Many of us acknowledge that we are servants--that everything we have
   belongs to our Master and that we are bound to live for Him. So far, so
   good. But we may get as far as that and yet, in the end, we may be
   found unprofitable servants and so be cast into outer darkness where
   shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Let us take heed of this.

   This man, though a servant, thought ill of his master and disliked his
   service. He said, "I knew that you are an hard man, reaping where you
   have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed." Certain
   professors who have stolen into the Church are of the same mind--they
   dare not say that they regret their having joined the Church and yet
   they act that all may conclude that if it could be undone they would
   not do the same again. They do not find pleasure in the service of God,
   but continue to pursue its routine as a matter of habit or a hard
   obligation.

   They get into the spirit of the elder brother and they say, "Lo, these
   many years have I served you; neither transgressed I at any time your
   commandments and yet you never gave me a kid that I might make merry
   with my friends." They sit down on the shady side of godliness and
   never bask in the sun which shines full upon it. They forget that the
   father said to the elder son, "Son, you are always with me and all that
   I have is yours." He might have had as many feasts, as many lambs and
   kids as he desired--he would have been denied no good thing. The
   presence of his father ought to have been his joy and his delight--and
   better than all merry-makings with his friends. And it would have been
   so if he had been in a proper state of heart.

   The man who hid his talent had carried the evil and petulant spirit
   much further than that elder brother, but the germs are the same and we
   must be careful that we crush them at the beginning. This unprofitable
   servant looked upon his master as one that reaped where he never sowed
   and used the rake to gather together what he had never scattered--he
   meant that his master was a hard, exacting and unjust person whom it
   was difficult to please. He judged his lord to be one who expected more
   of his servants than he had any right to look for and he had such a
   hatred of his unjust conduct that he resolved to tell him to his face
   what he thought of him.

   This spirit may readily creep over the minds of professors. I fear it
   is brooding over many even now, for they are not content with Christ.
   If they want pleasure, they go outside the Church to get it--their joys
   are not within the circle of which Christ is the center. Their religion
   is their labor, not their delight. Their God is their dread, not their
   joy. They do not delight themselves in the Lord and, therefore, He does
   not give them the desire of their hearts and so they grow more and more
   discontented. They could not call Him, "God, my exceeding joy," and so
   He is a terror to them. Devotion is a dreary engagement to them--they
   wish that they could escape from it with an easy conscience. They do
   not say as much to their secret selves, but you can read between the
   lines these words--"What a weariness it is."

   It is no wonder when things come to this pass that a professor becomes
   an unprofitable servant, for who can do a work, well, which he hates to
   do? Forced service is not desirable. God needs not slaves to Grace His
   Throne. A servant who is not pleased with his situation had better
   leave--if he is not content with his master, he had better find
   another, for their mutual relationship will be unpleasant and
   unprofitable. When it comes to this, that you and I are discontented
   with our God and dissatisfied with His work, we had better look for
   another lord, if any such will have us, for we shall certainly be
   unprofitable to the Lord Jesus from our lack of love to Him.

   Note next, that, albeit this man was doing nothing for his master, he
   did not think himself an unprofitable servant. He exhibited no
   self-depreciation, no humbling, no contrition. He was as bold as brass
   and said unblushingly, "Lo, there you have what is yours." He came
   before his master with no apologies or excuses. He did not join with
   those who have done all and then say, "We are unprofitable servants,"
   for he felt that he had dealt with his lord as the justice of the case
   deserved. Indeed, instead of acknowledging any fault, he turned to
   accusing his lord!

   It is even so with false professors. They have no idea that they are
   hypocrites. The thought does not cross their minds. They have no notion
   that they are unfaithful. Hint at it and see how they will defend
   themselves! If they are not living as they ought to do, they claim to
   be pitied rather than blamed--the blame lies with Providence! It is the
   fault of circumstances! It is the fault of anybody but themselves. They
   have done nothing and yet they feel more at ease than those who have
   done everything. They have taken the trouble to dig in the earth and
   hide their talent and they as good as ask-- "What more do you want? Is
   God so exacting as to expect me to bring more to Him than He gave me? I
   am as grateful and prayerful as God makes me--what more will He
   require?"

   There is, you see, no bowing in the dust with a sense of imperfection,
   but an arrogant casting upon God of all blame and this, too, under the
   pretense of honoring His Sovereign Grace! Ah me, that men should be
   able to torture the Truth of God into such presumptuous falsehood! Mark
   well that the verdict of justice, at last, may turn out to be the very
   opposite of that which we pronounce upon ourselves. He who proudly
   thinks himself profitable shall be found unprofitable and he who
   modestly judges himself to be unprofitable may, in the end, come to
   hear his Master say, "Well done, good and faithful servant."

   So little are we able, through the defects of our conscience, to form a
   right estimate of ourselves, that we frequently reckon ourselves to be
   rich and increased in goods and having need of nothing when, indeed, we
   are naked and poor and miserable. Such was the case with this
   unfaithful servant--he wrapped himself up in the conceit that he was
   even more just than his lord and had an argument to plead which he
   thought would exonerate him from all blame. It should give rise to much
   searching of heart when we notice what this unprofitable servant did,
   or, rather, what he did not do. He carefully deposited his capital
   where no one was able to find it and steal it--and that was the end of
   his service.

   We ought to observe that he did not spend that talent upon himself, or
   use it in business for his own benefit. He was not a thief, nor in any
   way did he misappropriate moneys placed under his charge. In this he
   excels many who profess to be the servants of God and yet live only to
   themselves. What little talent they have is used in their own business
   and never upon their Lord's concerns. They have the power of getting
   money, but their money is not made for Christ--such an idea never
   occurs to them. Their efforts are all for themselves, or, to use other
   words to express the same thing--for their families.

   Yonder is a man who has the gift of eloquent speech and he uses it, not
   for Christ, but for himself, that he may win popularity; that he might
   arrive at a respectable position. The one end and objective of his most
   earnest speech is to bring grist to his own mill and gain to his own
   estate. Everywhere this is to be seen among professors, that they are
   living to themselves--they are not adulterers or drunks, far from
   it--neither are they thieves or spendthrifts. They are decent, orderly,
   quiet sort of people but, still, they begin and end with self. What is
   this but to be an unprofitable servant? What is a servant to me if he
   works hard for himself and does nothing for me?

   A professing Christian may toil till he becomes a rich man, an alderman
   in the city, a Lord Mayor, a member of Parliament, a millionaire--but
   what does that prove? Why, that he could work and did work well for
   himself and if all this while he has done little or nothing for Christ,
   he is all the more condemned by his own success! If he had worked for
   his Lord as he worked for himself, what might he not have accomplished?
   The unprofitable servant in the parable was not so bad as that and yet
   he was cast into outer darkness. What, then, will become of some of
   you? Furthermore, the wicked servant did not go and misspend his
   talent. He did not waste it in self-indulgence and wickedness as the
   prodigal son did, who spent his substance in riotous living.

   Oh no, he was a much better man than that! He would not waste a
   halfpenny! He was all for saving and running no risks. The talent was
   as he received it, only wrapped up in a napkin and hidden in the
   earth--put into a bank, in fact-- but a bank which gave no interest! He
   never touched a penny of it for a feast or a revel and, therefore,
   could not be accused of being a spendthrift with his lord's money. In
   fact, he was superior to those who yield their strength to sin and use
   their abilities to gratify the guilty passions of themselves and
   others. I grieve to add that some who call themselves

   servants of Christ lay out their strength to undermine the Gospel they
   profess to teach! They speak against the holy name by which they are
   named and thus they use their talent against their Master.

   This man did not do that. He was bad enough in heart for anything, but
   he had never openly become so base a traitor. He never employed
   learning in order to raise needless doubts, or to resist the plain
   doctrines of the Word of God. This has been reserved for Divines of
   these latter days--days which produce monsters unknown to less educated
   times. This man's talent had not been wasted under his hand--it was as
   he had received it and he, therefore, reckoned he had been faithful.
   Ah, but this is not what Christ calls faithfulness--just to stay where
   we are! If you think you have gifts and only keep what you have,
   without obtaining more, it will be hiding your talent in the earth and
   keeping it a barren thing. It is not enough to retain--you must
   advance. The capital may be there, but where is the interest? To be
   living without aim or purpose beyond that of keeping up your position
   is to be a wicked and slothful servant, condemned already.

   While meditating upon this subject, may we, each one, say to himself,
   "Lord, is it I?" His lord called this servant "wicked." Is it, then, a
   wicked thing to be unprofitable? Surely wickedness must mean some
   positive action! No. Not to do right is to be wicked! Not to live for
   Christ is to be wicked! Not to be of use in the world is to be wicked!
   Not to bring glory to the name of the Lord is to be wicked! To be
   slothful is to be wicked! It is clear that there are many wicked people
   in the world who would not like to be called so. "Wicked and
   slothful"--these are the two words which are riveted together by the
   Lord Jesus, whose speech is always wise.

   A schoolboy was asked by his master "What are you doing, John?" He was
   called up and thought to be quite clear by saying, "I was doing
   nothing, Sir." But his master answered, "That is the very thing for
   which I called you out, for you ought to have been doing the lesson
   which I set before you." It will be no excuse, at the last, for you to
   cry, "I was doing nothing, Sir." Were not those on the left hand made
   to depart with a curse upon them because they did nothing? Is it not
   written--"Curse you Meroz, said the Angel of the Lord, curse you
   bitterly the inhabitants thereof because they came not to the help of
   the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty." He who does
   nothing is a "wicked and slothful servant."

   This man was condemned to outer darkness. Notice this! He was condemned
   to be as he was, for Hell, in one light, may be described as the great
   Captain's saying, "As you were." "He that is unjust, let him be unjust,
   still. And he that is filthy, let him be filthy, still." In another
   world there is permanence of character--enduring holiness is Heaven but
   continual evil is Hell. This man was outside of the family of his lord.
   He thought his lord a hard master and so proved that he had no love to
   him and that he was not really one of his household. He was outside in
   heart and so his lord said to him, "Remain outside." Besides that, he
   was in the dark--he had wrong notions of his master, for his lord was
   not an austere and hard man. He did not gather where he had not
   scattered, nor reap where he had not sown. Therefore his lord said,
   "You are willfully in the dark: abide there in the darkness which is
   outside."

   This man was envious. He could not endure his master's prosperity. He
   gnashed his teeth at the thought of it. He was sentenced to continue in
   that mind and so to gnash his teeth forever. This is a dreadful idea of
   eternal punishment, this permanence of character in an immortal
   spirit--"He that is unjust, let him be unjust, still." While the
   character of the ungodly will be permanent, it will also be more and
   more developed along its own lines--the bad points will become worse
   and, with nothing to restrain them--evil will become still viler. In
   the next world, where there are no hindrances from the existence of a
   Church and a Gospel, the man will ripen to a more hideous maturity of
   enmity against God and a more horrible degree of consequent misery.

   Sorrow is bound up with sin--abiding in sinfulness, a man must
   necessarily abide in wretchedness--for the wicked is like the troubled
   sea which cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt. What must it
   be to be forever outside the family of God? Never to be God's child?
   Forever in the dark? Never to see the light of holy knowledge and
   purity and hope? Forever to gnash one's teeth with painful contempt and
   abhorrence of God, whom to hate is Hell? O for Grace to be made to love
   Him, whom to love is Heaven! The unprofitable servant had a dreadful
   wage to take when his master reckoned with him, but who can say that he
   had not well earned it? He had the due reward of his deeds. O our God,
   grant that such may not be the lot of any one of us!

   II. I must now call your attention to the second text--"So likewise
   you, when you shall have done all those things which are commanded you,
   say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty
   to do" (Luke

   17:10). This is THE VERDICT OF SELF-ABASEMENT given forth from the
   heart of servants who had laboriously discharged the full work of the
   day. This is a part of a parable intended to rebuke all notions of
   self-importance and human merit.

   When a servant has been plowing or feeding cattle, his master does not
   say to him, "Sit down and I will wait upon you, for I am deeply in your
   debt." No, his master bids him prepare the evening meal and wait upon
   him. His services are due and, therefore, his master does not praise
   him as if he were a wonder and a hero. He is only doing his duty if he
   perseveres from morning light to set of sun and he by no means expects
   to have his work held up to admiration or rewarded with extra pay and
   humble thanks. Neither are we to boast of our services, but think
   little of them, confessing that we are unprofitable servants.

   Whatever of pain may have been caused by the first part of the
   discourse, I trust it will only prepare us the more deeply to enter
   into the spirit of our second text. Both these texts are engraved on my
   heart as with an iron pen by a merciless wound inflicted when I was too
   feeble to bear it. When I was exceedingly ill in the South of France
   and deeply depressed in spirit--so deeply depressed and so sick and ill
   that I scarcely knew how to live--one of those malicious persons who
   commonly haunt all public men and especially ministers, sent me
   anonymously a letter, openly directed to "That unprofitable servant, C.
   H. Spurgeon."

   This letter contained tracts directed to the enemies of the Lord Jesus,
   with passages marked and underlined--with notes applying them to
   myself. How many Rabshekahs have, in their day, written to me!
   Ordinarily I read them with the patience which comes of use and they go
   to light the fire. I do not look for exemption from this annoyance, nor
   do I usually feel it hard to bear, but in the hour when my spirits were
   depressed and I was in terrible pain, this reviling letter cut me to
   the quick. I turned upon my bed and asked--Am I, then, an unprofitable
   servant? I grieved exceedingly and could not lift up my head or find
   rest.

   I reviewed my life and saw its infirmities and imperfections, but knew
   not how to put my case till this second text came to my relief and
   answered as the verdict of my bruised heart. I said to myself, "I hope
   I am not an unprofitable servant in the sense in which this person
   intends to call me so, but I am assuredly so in the other sense." I
   cast myself upon my Lord and Master once again with a deeper sense of
   the meaning of the text than I had felt before--His atoning Sacrifice
   revived me and in humble faith I found rest. By the way, I wonder that
   any human being should find pleasure in trying to inflict pain upon
   those who are sick and depressed, yet are there persons who delight to
   do so. Surely, if there are no evil spirits down below, there are some
   up above and the servants of the Lord Jesus receive painful proofs of
   their activity!

   Let me, then, if you have felt any pain from the first text, lead you
   to the point at which I personally arrived when, at last, I could thank
   God for that letter and feel that it was salutary medicine to my
   spirit. This which is put into our mouths as a confession--that we are
   unprofitable servants--is meant to rebuke us when we think we are
   somebody and have done something worthy of praise. Our text is meant to
   rebuke us if we think that we have done enough, that we have borne the
   burden and heat of the day a long time and have been kept at our post
   beyond our own watch. If we conclude that we have achieved a fine day's
   work of harvesting and ought to be invited home to rest, the text
   upbraids us. If we feel an inordinate covetousness after comfort and
   wish the Lord would give us some present and striking reward for what
   we have done, the text shames us. This is a proud, unchildlike,
   unservantlike spirit and it must be put down with a firm hand.

   In the first place, in what way can we have profited God? Eliphaz has
   well said, "Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be
   profitable unto himself? Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that you
   are righteous? Or is it gain to Him that you make your ways perfect?"
   If we have given to God of our substance, is He our debtor? In what way
   have we enriched Him to whom all the silver and gold belongs? If we
   have laid our lives out with the devotion of martyrs and missionaries
   for His sake, what is that to Him, whose Glory fills the heavens and
   the earth? How can we dream of putting the Eternal in debt to us? The
   right spirit is to say with David, "O my Soul, you have said unto the
   Lord, You are my Lord: my goodness extends not to You; but to the
   saints that are in the earth and to the excellent, in whom is all my
   delight." How can a man place his Maker under an obligation to him? Let
   us not dote so blasphemously!

   Dear Brothers and Sisters, we ought to remember that whatever service
   we have been able to render has been a matter of debt. I hope our
   morality is not fallen so low that we take credit to ourselves for
   paying our debts! I do not find

   men in business priding themselves and saying, "I paid a thousand
   pounds this morning to such an one." "Well, did you give it to him?"
   "Oh no, it was all owing to him." Is that any great thing? Have we come
   to such a low state of spiritual morals that we think we have done a
   great deal when we give to God His due? "It is He that made us and not
   we ourselves." Jesus Christ has bought us, "we are not our own," for we
   are "bought with a price."

   We have also entered into covenant with Him and given ourselves over to
   Him voluntarily. Were we not baptized into His name and into His death?
   Whatever we may do is only what He has a right to claim at our hands
   from our creation, redemption and professed surrender to Him. When we
   have persevered in the hard work of plowing till no field is left
   untilled; when we have done the pleasant work of feeding the sheep and
   when we have finished by spreading the table of communion for our
   Lord--when we have done all--we have done no more than was our duty to
   have done! Why do we boast, then, or cry for a discharge, or look for
   thanks?

   Over and above this there is the sad reflection that, alas, in all we
   have done we have been unprofitable through being imperfect. In the
   plowing there have been baulks; in the feeding of the cattle there have
   been harshness and forgetful-ness; in the spreading of the table the
   viands have been unworthy of such a Lord as we serve. How must our
   service appear to Him of whom we read, "Behold, He put no trust in His
   servants and His angels He charged with folly." Can any of you look
   back upon your service to your Lord with satisfaction? If you can, I
   cannot say I envy you, for I do not sympathize with you in the least
   degree, but tremble for your safety!

   As for myself, I am compelled to say with solemn truthfulness that I am
   not content with anything I have ever done. I have half wished to live
   my life over again, but now I regret that my proud heart allowed me to
   so wish, since the probabilities are that I should do worse the second
   time. Whatever Grace has done for me I acknowledge with deep gratitude,
   but so far as I have done anything myself, I beg pardon for it. I pray
   God to forgive my prayers, for they have been full of fault. I beseech
   Him to forgive even this confession, for it is not as humble as it
   ought to be. I beseech Him to wash my tears and purge my devotions and
   to baptize me into a true burial with my Savior that I may be quite
   forgotten in myself and only remembered in Him. Ah, Lord, You know how
   far we fall short of the humility we ought to feel. Pardon us in this
   thing. We are, all of us, unprofitable servants, and if You should
   judge us by the Law we must be cast away.

   Once more, we cannot congratulate ourselves at all, even if we have had
   success in our Lord's work, since for all that we have done we are
   indebted to our Lord's abundant Grace. If we had done all our duty, we
   should not have done anything if His Grace had not enabled us to do it!
   If our zeal knows no respite, it is He that keeps the fire burning! If
   our tears of repentance flow, it is He that strikes the rock and
   fetches the waters from it! If there is any virtue, if there is any
   praise, if there is any faith, if there is any ardor, if there is any
   likeness to Christ, we are His workmanship, created by Him and,
   therefore, to ourselves we dare not take a particle of the praise!

   Of Your own have we given unto You, great God! So far as anything has
   been worth Your accepting, it was Your own beforehand. Therefore the
   best are still unprofitable servants! If we have special cause of
   regret because of some evident error, we shall be wise to go in a lowly
   spirit and confess the fault and then go on doing the work of each day
   in a plodding, hopeful spirit. Whenever you get distressed because you
   cannot do what you would. Whenever you see the faultiness of your own
   service and condemn yourself for it, the best thing is to go and do
   something more in the strength of the Lord. If you have not served
   Jesus well up to now, go and do better!

   If you make a blunder, do not tell everybody and say that you will
   never try again, but do two good things to make up for the failure.
   Say, "My blessed Lord and Master shall not be more a loser by me than I
   can help. I will not so much fret over the past as amend the present
   and wake up for the future." Brothers and Sisters, try to be more
   profitable and ask for more Grace. The servant's business is not to
   hide himself in a corner of the field and cry, but to go on plowing.
   You are not to bleat with the sheep, but feed them and so prove your
   love to Jesus. You are not to stand at the head of the table and say,
   "I have not spread the table for my Master as well as I could have
   desired." No? Go and spread it better!

   Have courage, you are not serving a hard Master and, though you very
   properly call yourself an unprofitable servant, be of good cheer, for a
   gentler verdict shall be pronounced upon you before long. You are not
   your own judge-- either for good or bad--another Judge is at the door
   and when He comes He will think better of you than your self-abasement
   permits you to think of yourself. He will judge you by the rule of
   Grace and not by Law and He will end all that dread which comes of a
   legal spirit and hovers over you with vampire wings.

   III. Thus we have arrived at the third text--"His lord said unto him,
   Well done, you good and faithful servant" (Mat. 25:21). I shall not try
   to preach upon that cheering word, but shall only say a word or two
   upon it. It is much too grand a text to be treated upon at the end of a
   sermon. We find the Lord saying to those who had used their talents
   industriously, "Well done, good and faithful servant." This is THE
   VERDICT OF GRACE. Blessed is the man who shall acknowledge himself to
   be an unfaithful servant--and blessed is the man to whom His Lord shall
   say, "You good and faithful servant."

   Observe here that the, "Well done," of the Master is given to
   faithfulness. It is not, "Well done, you good and brilliant servant"
   for, perhaps, the man never shone at all in the eyes of those who
   appreciate glare and glitter. It is not, "Well done, you great and
   distinguished servant" for, it is possible that he was never known
   beyond his native village. He conscientiously did his best with his
   "few things" and never wasted an opportunity for faithfully doing good
   and, thus, he proved himself. The same praise was given to the man with
   two talents as to his fellow servant with five. Their stations were
   very different, but their reward was the same. "Well done, good and
   faithful servant," was won and enjoyed by each of them.

   Is it not very sweet to think that though I may have only one talent, I
   shall not, thereby, be debarred from my Lord's praise? It is my
   faithfulness on which He will fix His eyes and not upon the number of
   my talents! I may have made many mistakes and have confessed my faults
   with great grief, but He will commend me as He did the woman of whom He
   said, "She has done what she could." It is better to be faithful in the
   infant school than to be unfaithful in a noble class of young men. It
   is better to be faithful in a hamlet over two or three score of people
   than to be unfaithful in a great city parish, with thousands perishing
   in consequence! It is better to be faithful in a cottage meeting,
   speaking of Christ Crucified to 50 villagers than to be unfaithful in a
   great building where thousands congregate.

   I pray you are faithful in laying out all that you are and have for
   God. As long as you live, whatever faults you have, be not half-hearted
   or double-minded, but be faithful in intent and desire. This is the
   point of the Judge's praise--the servant's faithfulness. This verdict
   was given of Sovereign Grace. The reward was not according to the work,
   for the servant had been "faithful in a few things," but he was made
   "ruler over many things." The verdict itself is not after the rule of
   works, but according to the law of Grace! Our good works are evidences
   of Grace within us! Our faithfulness, therefore, as servants--will be
   the evidence of our having a loving spirit towards our
   Master--evidence, therefore, that our heart is changed and that we have
   been made to love Him for whom once we had no affection.

   Our works are the proof of our love and, therefore, they stand as
   evidence of the Grace of God. God first gives us Grace and then rewards
   us for it! He works in us and then counts the fruit as our work. We
   work out our own salvation, because "He works in us to will and to do
   of His own good pleasure." If He shall ever say, "Well done" to you and
   to me it will be because of His own rich Grace and not because of our
   merits! And, indeed, this is where we must all come and where we must
   all stay, for the idea that we have any personal merit will soon make
   us find fault with our Master and His service as being austere and
   hard.

   I have sometimes admired how men who have denied the doctrine of
   Salvation by Grace, as a matter of theology, have, nevertheless,
   admitted it in their devotions. They have entered into controversy
   against it and yet unconsciously they have believed it! An extreme case
   is that of Cardinal Bellarmine, who was one of the most inveterate
   enemies of the Reformation and a renowned antagonist of the teaching of
   Martin Luther. I will quote from one of his works (Inst. Do
   Justification, Lib. v., c. 1). He says, in summing up, "On account of
   the uncertain nature of our own works and the danger of vain-glory, it
   is the safest course to place our whole trust in the mercy and loving
   kindness of God."

   You have said well, O Cardinal! And since the safest course is that
   which we would choose, we will place our whole trust in the mercy and
   loving kindness of God! It is reported and, I believe on excellent
   authority, that this great man who had, all his life, been crying up
   salvation by works, when dying, breathed a prayer in Latin, the
   translation of which would be something like this--"I beseech God, who
   weighs not our merits, but graciously pardons our offenses, that He
   would receive me among His saints and His elect." Is Saul, also, among
   the Prophets? Does Bellarmine, at the last, pray like a Calvinist? Such
   a case makes one hope that many others may be saved in an apostate
   church! Thank God many are a great deal better than their creed and in
   their hearts believe what, as polemical theologians, they deny. However
   this may be, I know that if I am saved or rewarded it must be of Grace
   alone, for I can have no other hope. As for those who have done much
   for the Church, we know that they will disclaim all praise, saying,
   "Lord, when did we see You hungry and

   give You meat; or thirsty and give You drink?" All the Lord's faithful
   servants will sing, "Non nobis domine." Not unto us. Not unto us!

   Lastly, Brothers, with what infinite delight will Jesus fill our hearts
   if, through Divine Grace, we are happy enough to hear Him say, "Well
   done, good and faithful servant." Oh, if we shall hold on to the end
   despite the temptations of Satan and the weakness of our nature and all
   the entanglements of the world! Oh, if we can keep our garments
   unspotted from the world, preaching Christ according to our measure of
   ability and winning souls for Him, what an honor it will be! What bliss
   to hear Him say, "Well done!" The music of these two words will have
   Heaven in them to us. How different it will be from the verdict of our
   fellow men who are often finding fault with this and that, though we do
   our best. We never could please them, but we have pleased our Lord!

   Men were always misinterpreting our words and misjudging our motives,
   but He sets all right by saying, "Well done!" Little will it matter,
   then, what all the rest have said--neither the flattering words of
   friends nor the harsh condemnations of enemies will have any weight
   with us when He says, "Well done!" Not with pride shall we receive that
   eu-logium, for we shall reckon ourselves, even then, to have been
   unprofitable servants. But oh how we shall love Him for setting such an
   estimate upon the cups of cold water we gave to His disciples and the
   poor broken service we tried to render Him! What condescension to call
   that well done, which we feel was so ill done!

   I pray God's servants here, who, this morning first began with
   searching themselves and then went on to confess their imperfections,
   will now close by rejoicing in the fact that if we are believing in
   Christ Jesus and are really consecrated to Him, we shall conclude this
   life and begin the next with that blessed verdict of, "Well done!"
   Mind, however, that you are those who are doing all and are faithful. I
   hear some people speak against self-righteousness, to whom I would say,
   "You need not say much about that matter, for it does not concern you,
   since you have no righteousness to be proud of."

   I hear persons speak against salvation by good works who are in no
   danger of falling into that error, since good works and their lives
   have long parted company. What I do admire is to see a man like Paul
   who lived for Jesus and was ready to die for Him, yet saying, at the
   close of his life, "But what things were gain to me, those I counted
   loss for Christ. Yes, doubtless and I count all things but loss for the
   excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have
   suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung, that I may
   win Christ and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which
   is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
   righteousness which is of God by faith."

   Go on, Brothers and Sisters, and think not of resting till your day's
   work is done. Serve God with all your might! Do more than the Pharisees
   who hope to be saved by their zeal. Do more than your brethren expect
   of you and then, when you have done all, lay it at your Redeemer's feet
   with this confession, "I am an unprofitable servant." It is to those
   who blend faithfulness with humility and ardor with self-abasement that
   Jesus will say, "Well done, good and faithful servant: enter you into
   the joy of your Lord."

Free Grace a Motive for Free Giving

   (No. 1542)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 13, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Now our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God, even our Father, which has
   loved us and has given us everlasting consolation and good hope through
   Grace, comfort your hearts and establish you in every good word and
   work." 2 Thessalonians 2:16,17.

   ON BEHALF OF THE FREE HOSPITALS OF LONDON.

   THE Thessalonian saints had been much persecuted and afflicted and they
   had exhibited great faith, so much so that Paul says, "We ourselves
   glory in you in the Church of God for your patience and faith." As if
   they had not enough trouble coming from the outside, there sprang up in
   their midst certain hot-headed teachers who declared that the Day of
   Christ was immediately at hand. The coming of the Lord is the most
   grand hope of the Church and it is an evidence of the extreme power of
   error to poison and pervert the Truth of God that a hope which is our
   brightest consolation can be so twisted as to cause the saints to be
   "shaken in mind" and troubled.

   But so it appears to have been with the Thessalonians. They were
   perplexed with mysterious rumors which the zealots probably supported
   by a misinterpretation of the Apostle's own language in his former
   letter to them. It would appear that they were tempted to leave their
   regular habits of life--some of them even neglected their business upon
   the theory that there was no need to attend to it because the world was
   so speedily to be at an end. This gave an occasion for "busybodies" to
   cease from working and create great disquietude among the more sober
   members and, therefore, Paul wrote them this second letter with the
   earnest intent that they might be established in the Truth of God, kept
   from evil and that disorderly walking might be repressed and that the
   Church might be at peace. Paul felt that it was of the utmost
   importance that this honorable Church should be at rest and should not
   lack consolation either as to its bitter persecutions or its internal
   difficulties.

   My subject, this morning, leads me to make this the first point to be
   dwelt upon--it is most important that Believers should enjoy
   consolation. When I have, for a while, spoken upon that, I would with
   delight expatiate upon the fact that this consolation is most freely
   provided and bestowed in the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ--and it is
   from this subject that I purpose to draw a practical inference which
   may help the collection for the hospitals, namely, that the freeness
   with which these consolations are given to us should lead us to a holy
   benevolence towards others who need consolation.

   I. First, then, IT IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE THAT BELIEVERS SHOULD
   ENJOY CONSOLATION. We must not say that it does not matter whether we
   are doubting or believing, whether we are sighing or rejoicing--it does
   matter a great deal. Every commander knows that if he has not his
   soldiers in good heart, there may be a great many of them and they may
   be well trained for war, but the battle is not likely to be won.
   Courage is essential to valor. Much depends upon the case in which a
   man finds himself upon the eve of conflict. If the soldier has no
   stomach for the fight, as our forefathers were known to say, he will
   make a sorry display when the tug of war comes on.

   The Lord delights not to see His people with their heads hanging down
   like bulrushes, depressed and dismayed. His Word to them is, "Be
   strong; fear not." He is "the blessed God" and He would have those who
   know His glorious Gospel to live a life of blessedness, that they may
   the better serve Him. Does not His Spirit say, "Rejoice in the Lord
   always and again I say, Rejoice"? Has He not given the Comforter, that
   He may continually console us? Believers will far better answer the
   Lord's purpose and bring more glory to His name if they are filled with
   peace and joy in believing, than they will if they yield to
   despondency, for the Scripture says, "the joy of the Lord is your
   strength."

   I am sure that the Lord would have us be of good courage, for its
   importance is implied in the very existence of our text. It is the
   prayer of an Inspired man. Paul wrote not only at the dictate of
   brotherly love, but under the guidance of

   the Holy Spirit when he penned this prayer, "Now our Lord Jesus Christ
   Himself and God, even our Father, comfort your hearts and establish you
   in every good word and work." The Holy Spirit moved the man of God to
   breathe this desire and to put it on record that it might be the desire
   of all good men as long as ever the Epistle should be read and that all
   Christian men should value consolation, even as it was valued by one
   who was a tender lover of the flock of Christ.

   It would be great presumption on our part to lightly esteem that which
   was a prime matter of concern with so instructed and experienced a
   teacher as the Apostle to the Gentiles. Paul puts this prayer into a
   very remarkable shape. To my mind it is expressed in a deeply solemn
   form, for he writes, "Now our Lord Jesus Christ Himself." Was there
   need for that word, "Himself? Does it not make it very emphatic that he
   seems to call upon the Lord Jesus to give them comfort, not by any
   intermediate agency, but in His own Person and by His own power? It is
   so essential that we should be comforted that Jesus, even our own Lord
   Jesus Christ, is entreated, Himself, to become the Consolation of His
   people. Is not that a weighty matter which leads the reverent heart of
   Paul thus to plead?

   Nor is this all, for he goes on to say, "and God, even our Father," as
   if God the Father, Himself, must undertake the work of cheering His
   people, so necessary was it that they should be at rest. No one else
   could give them such comfort as they required. But God could do it and,
   therefore, "God, even our Father," must be specially invoked. The
   prayer is that the Lord Jesus and the Father who are One may join in
   the most necessary work of comforting the hearts of the tried
   Thessalonian saints. It reminds me of Paul's solemn benediction in the
   opening of the Epistle, "Grace unto you and peace from God our Father
   and the Lord Jesus Christ."

   This prayer of Inspiration, couched in such solemn terms and directed
   so earnestly to the Lord Jesus Christ, Himself, and to God, even our
   Father, proves the importance and necessity of saints being filled with
   comfort. Nor is this the only instance in the Epistle where this desire
   is expressed, for a little farther on, in the third chapter, at the
   16th verse, we have it in other words but with equal forcefulness--"Now
   the Lord of Peace, Himself, give you peace always by all means." I do
   not know that in one single sentence there could be compressed a more
   intense desire that they may be at peace. "The Lord" is invoked and He
   is styled, "the Lord of Peace," that all His Divine Majesty may be seen
   and His peace-making power may be displayed.

   "The Lord of Peace" is entreated to give peace, not by His angels nor
   by His ministers, nor by His Providence, but, "Himself," to give
   peace--and this is asked for "always"--"give you peace always." Peace
   in the cool of the evening is not enough--it is needed at all parts of
   the day, in all the days of the year, in every period of life, in every
   place and under all circumstances! The wish is expressed with great
   breadth in the words, "Give you peace always by all means"--if it
   cannot be brought by one means, let it be by another, but somehow or
   other may you enjoy the peace which the Lord, alone, can create!

   I cannot imagine that such a prayer as this would have been placed
   among the Scriptures of Truth, which are to be our guide till the Lord
   comes, unless it had been of the utmost importance that we should enjoy
   peace of mind. The Apostle almost hints at one reason for this strong
   necessity, for in one word he lets us see that it is a vital blessing
   because it affects the Christian's heart. His expression is, "Comfort
   your hearts." It is well to have strong hands--how else shall we labor?
   It is well to have a firm feet, how else shall we stand? Yet these are
   secondary matters as compared with a healthy heart. A disease of the
   heart is an injury to the whole man. If anything goes amiss at the
   fountain, the streams of life soon feel it. The entire manhood depends
   upon the heart--hence the need of comfort for the heart and the value
   of the promise, "He shall strengthen your heart."

   It is a calamity when the springs of action are weakened and the spirit
   is made to sink. "The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity, but a
   wounded spirit who can bear?" Touch the flesh where you will, but spare
   the brain and the heart, for these are the man so nearly that he is
   wounded to the quick when these are hurt. When the spirits begin to
   sink, then the waters have come in, even into the soul. Hence our Lord
   said to His disciples, "Let not your heart be troubled." However your
   house may be troubled, however your bodily frame may be troubled, "let
   not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me."
   Faith upholds the heart and enables the man to bear up under
   pressure--faith, I say and nothing else.

   I am sure, dear Friends, you will clearly see the need that we should
   be comforted, because the lack of comfort will grievously affect the
   action of the heart and mar the entire life force of our being. See you
   to it, then, that you lift up the hands that hang down and confirm the
   feeble knees by saying to them that are of a feeble heart, "Be strong,
   fear not."

   Ask that the heart may rejoice in God, for then the roughness of the
   way and the stress of the weather will be matters of small concern.
   Beloved Brethren, this confidence is necessary to prevent impatience
   and other evils. Possibly it was the lack of comfort which led certain
   of the Thessalonians to preach the immediate coming of the Lord--their
   impatience excited the wish and the wish led on to the assertion.

   When men lose the present comfort of plain Gospel Doctrines they are
   very apt to begin speculating and in carnal heat foretelling the coming
   of the Lord. They left that patient waiting which is our duty, for a
   fevered prophesying which is nowhere encouraged in the Word of God.
   Hence the Apostle said to them in the fifth verse of the third chapter,
   "The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient
   waiting for Christ." A man does not wait patiently when he is low in
   spirit and weary at heart. Let a man feel his own heart right with God
   and be at peace and he can quietly wait until Christ comes, even though
   the Lord shall delay His coming for many a day. But when everything is
   tossed about and our hope grows dim and our fellowship is broken and
   our zeal is burning low, we jump at anything which will end the
   struggle and enable us to avoid further effort.

   Laziness and despondency lead many to cry, "Why are His chariots so
   long in coming?" just as idle workmen long for Saturday night. You
   think time too long and life too long, for you are not happy where your
   Lord has placed you and you are eager to rush out of the field of
   service into the chamber of rest. This will not do, my Brothers and
   Sisters, either for you or for me. We must be braced up to further
   labor. We must receive comfort in our spirit that we may be able,
   patiently, to toil on, however long life may be and however long our
   Lord may delay. For if not--if we grow impatient--we may resort to rash
   fanatical action as I have already shown you that certain Thessalonians
   did. Under the idea that the Lord was coming, they neglected their
   daily calling and became busybodies, gadding about from house to house
   and loafing upon others who did not pretend to be quite so spiritual.

   They were mere star-gazers, looking for the Advent with their mouths
   open and their eyes turned up, being evermore in grievous danger of
   falling into a ditch! Paul bade them get to work and eat their own
   bread, quoting himself as an example, for he had worked with labor and
   travail night and day that he might not be chargeable to them. My
   Friend, if you are growing impatient for the Day of the Lord, I pray
   that comfort of heart may cool you. Tomorrow morning take down the shop
   shutters and sell your goods as if Christ were not coming at all, for
   should He come, you will be all the more fit to meet Him for being
   engaged in your calling.

   If I knew that the Lord would come tomorrow I should attend to my
   regular Monday duties and on no account leave one of them to go and
   stand at the window, looking for wonders! Whether the Master comes
   tomorrow or in a thousand years, your wisest course is to follow your
   calling in His fear and for His sake. We ought to do our work better
   under the impression that perhaps He may come and find us at it! We may
   not neglect our duty under pretense of His appearing. Of this, however,
   be sure, you will not patiently wait if you are not happy. You will not
   go on conscientiously plodding, doing the same work, walking in the
   same regular way unless your heart is stayed upon God! You will run
   after this novelty or that if your mind is not resting in Jesus. Hence
   the devout prayer of our text that God our Father and our Lord Jesus
   Christ, Himself, may comfort our hearts and establish us in every good
   word and work.

   Once more, I am sure this comfort is eminently desirable because it
   promotes fruitfulness. The Apostle more than hints at this--"Comfort
   your hearts and establish you in every good word and work." When we are
   not happy in the Lord we do not give ourselves heartily to His service.
   We grow impatient and then we need the exhortation of the 13th verse of
   the third chapter, "But you, Brethren, be not weary in well doing." If
   we feel that Jesus is ours, that all things are working for our good
   and that eternal Glory is secured to us by a sure Covenant, we are
   moved by gratitude to complete consecration, for the love of Christ
   constrains us. Doubts and disquietudes take us off from our Master's
   work, but when He gives us rest, we take His yoke upon us cheerfully
   and find in it yet further rest unto our souls.

   When our hearts sing, our hands toil and we cannot do enough for our
   Redeeming Lord! Right gladly do we present ourselves as living
   sacrifices to Him who "loved us and gave Himself for us." Thus, too, we
   are established in our work and bound with fresh bonds to it, so that
   we delight to labor on till He shall come who shall say, "Well done,
   good and faithful servant: enter you into the joy of your Lord." So it
   all comes to this--we who are constitutionally despondent must not give
   way to depression--we must cry to God to help us by the Divine
   Comforter. We must aim at being cheerful Christians. We have abundant
   reasons for being cheerful, for the Father Himself loves us and has
   given us everlasting consolation in Christ Jesus. Do not let us be so
   unwise and so ungrateful as to neglect these consolations of the
   Spirit.

   If the table is sumptuously spread, why should we be hungry? It the
   fountain flows so freely, why should we be thirsty? Moreover, if we
   wear of a dark countenance, we may distress the weak ones in the family
   of God. It may be that we shall spread the infection of depression
   among our fellow Believers and this must not be. Let us wear our
   sackcloth on our loins if we must wear it, but let us not wave it in
   everybody's face lest we offend against the generation of the Lord's
   people! Is it not clear from the Word, Brethren, that we shall be
   damaged if we give way to apprehension and dismay? Is it not apparent
   that we are invigorated, equipped and prepared for our Lord's use when
   we are strong in the Lord and the power of His might? Therefore let us
   breathe earnestly to God the desire that His everlasting consolation
   may be laid home to our spirits and that our hearts may be comforted at
   this moment.

   II. We shall now turn to the second point of our meditation which is
   this--GOSPEL CONSOLATION IS MOST FREELY BESTOWED. I want, in the chief
   place, to call your attention to the manner in which all the way
   through, the freeness of Divine Consolation is set before us by the
   Apostle. First, observe that the consolations bestowed upon Believers
   are most free because they are described as a gift. "Now our Lord Jesus
   Christ Himself and God, even our Father, which has loved us and has
   given us everlasting consolation." The old proverb has it, "Nothing is
   freer than a gift." Every blessing that we receive from God comes as a
   gift.

   We have purchased nothing--what have we to purchase it with? We have
   earned nothing--what work did we ever do that could deserve everlasting
   consolation from the hand of the great Lord? Comfort in Christ is an
   absolutely free, spontaneous gift of Sovereign Grace, given not on
   account of anything we have done, or ever shall do, but because the
   Lord has a right to do as He wills with His own--therefore does He
   select unto Himself a people to whom the free gift of His consolation
   shall be given! If you have any comfort at this time, my Brothers and
   Sisters, it is God's gift to you. If you triumph in God, it is God who
   has given you your holy joy, therefore bless and praise Him from whom
   such a gift has come.

   The freeness of this gift is seen in every part of it. The consolation
   given us of God is very complete, but it is as manifestly free as it is
   evidently perfect. Notice its completeness, I pray you. It covers the
   past with these golden words, "which has loved us." As for the present,
   it is enriched with this Truth of God, "has given us everlasting
   consolation." And as for the future, it is glorified with this
   blessing, "and good hope through Grace." Here is a triple comfort, a
   consolation in three worlds and under each aspect it is a free favor!
   He "has loved us"--why is this? Come, you wise men, pry into the
   ancient past and tell me why God loved His chosen!

   Stand and gaze as long as you will into the eternal mind and say to
   yourself, why did God make this choice of love? The sole reply out of
   the excellent Glory falls from Jesus' lips--"Even so Father, for so it
   seemed good in Your sight." Shall not the bridegroom elect his own
   bride? Shall not the King of kings dispense His favors as He wills? He
   has loved us "from before the foundation of the world"--a love so
   ancient cannot have been born of any human cause. Eternal love is a
   flame enfolding itself--it borrows no fuel from without, but lives upon
   itself! He says, "I have loved you with an everlasting love, therefore
   with loving kindness have I drawn you." But why that everlasting love,
   we cannot tell. Beloved, by Divine Love the mysterious past is made to
   glow with the Glory of God--its light is like a stone most precious,
   even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.

   Once, when we looked back into the past, we saw the blackness of our
   guilt and the hole of the pit from which we were lifted. But now we
   behold a silver stream of mercy flowing from the Throne of God and of
   the Lamb and we track it to the eternal purpose of love and the
   Covenant of Grace. Gaze as you can into light ineffable, but even with
   the eye of faith all that you can discern in the ages which are past is
   this word which has a splendor about it beyond compare--the word,
   "LOVE." In eternity the Lord loved us! Oh, how free is this! How much
   we owe for it! The past is bright with love, with love most free!

   As for the present, "He has given us everlasting consolation." We have
   it now. Christ is His people's Christ today-- the consolation of Israel
   even now. The pardon of sin is ours; the perfect righteousness of
   Christ is ours; life in Christ is ours; union to Christ is ours;
   marriage to Christ is ours. Glory with Christ shall be ours by-and-by,
   but even now we have the earnest of it in the Spirit which dwells
   within us and shall be with us forever. All this is assuredly a
   gift--how could it be otherwise? We could never have enjoyed this
   everlasting consolation today if Free Grace and dying love had not
   brought it to us. Bless, then, the Giver!

   As for the future, what of that? Darkness lowers the clouds and the
   storm mutters from afar and we tremble lest in the end of life, when
   physical force decays, we may be overtaken with a storm in the article
   of death--but this covers all--we have "good hope through Grace." The
   Scriptures of Truth have assured us that the great Shepherd will be
   with us in the valley of death shade and that after death there is a
   resurrection and with our risen body we shall behold the King in His
   beauty when He shall stand, in the latter days, upon the earth and we
   shall, in our perfect manhood, dwell forever in His Glory. This is so
   good a hope that it fills all the future with music. This, too, is a
   gift. There is not a trace of legal claim in it--it comes not by way of
   reward, but of Divine favor.

   Thus the past, the present, the future are all rich with the Lord's own
   generous gifts and in nothing can we trace a single consolation to
   anything but Free Grace. Lest we should make any mistake about these
   consolations coming to us most freely, the Apostle mentions One from
   whose hand they come, from whom nothing has ever come in other manner
   but that of manifest Grace. He mentions, "our Lord Jesus Christ
   Himself." Oh it charms me to think that He should comfort me! When
   Jesus Christ begins to draw near a man's soul, his joy begins. But when
   the Lord sets Himself down steadily to console His Brethren, I
   guarantee you it is done in heavenly style, for He will not fail nor be
   discouraged! He will wash our feet if the weariness is there. He will
   give His bosom for a pillow for our head if the pain is there.

   He has said, "I will make all his bed in his sickness," so that if the
   woe comes from disease, He will cheer us there. He will anoint our eyes
   with salve if the eyes are failing and bind up the broken heart if that
   is bleeding. Lest we fall, He will put underneath us the everlasting
   arms and lest we are wounded, He will spread over us the shadow of His
   wings. He will be all to us that He is in Himself--judge you what that
   is. His whole being--His Godhead in its grandeur, His Humanity in its
   tenderness He has given to us. He lays Himself out for us and be sure
   of this--He will not leave us comfortless! He will come to us. He is
   such a blessed Sympathizer in all grief, such a mighty Helper in all
   distress that if He comes to our rescue, we may be sure that our
   deliverance will be accomplished.

   But, Brothers and Sisters, at the sight of our loving Lord we feel that
   it would be treason to impute His benefits to any motive but that of
   Grace. Is He not full of Grace and Truth? The Law came by Moses, not by
   Jesus. His coming was not to judge and to censure--"God sent not His
   Son into the world to condemn the world," much less did He send His Son
   to condemn His people! There will come a Day of Judgment, but just now
   the Son of God sits upon His Throne to grant pardons and to give Grace
   to help in times of need. His Throne is a Throne of Grace and His
   scepter is that of love. We know that the comforts of the Gospel must
   be graciously free since they are brought to us by Jesus Christ
   Himself.

   Then the Apostle solemnly adds, "and God our Father." There seems to me
   to be a peculiar touch of sweetness about this. It is not, "God the
   Father"--which notes His relation to Jesus, but our Father, which sets
   forth His relation to us. We love God the Father! Unto the Father be
   Glory forever and ever! But as "our Father" He comes nearer to us and
   gladdens our hearts. Now, a father does not pay wages to his children.
   His gifts to them are freely bestowed out of the love of his fatherly
   heart. What father expects to be paid for what he does for his sons and
   daughters?

   Thus we see that the everlasting consolations of the Gospel--coming to
   us because we are the children of God--are quite free from anything
   which makes them a hire or a debt. And they come to us in the freest
   possible manner as spontaneous donations of our great Father, whose
   delight it is to give good gifts to them that ask Him. Cannot you look
   up, you desponding ones, at this moment and cry, "Our Father"? Our
   first hymn greatly refreshed my spirit just now, for I felt very heavy
   till the Holy Spirit comforted me with it--

   "If in my Father's love I share a filial part, Send down Your Spirit,
   like a dove, To rest upon my heart."

   And I felt that I could urge that argument and in my inmost heart I
   pleaded it before the Lord--Oh, if I am, indeed, Your child and You are
   a Father to me, then deal with me as with a son and let me feel Your
   Spirit resting within my bosom, that I may know myself to be Yours
   beyond a doubt! O how sweet to feel the Spirit's witness and to cry,
   "Abba,

   Father"!

   Now, Beloved, the spirit of adoption is never a spirit of bondage or
   legality. It never boasts of human merit, but its one song is, "Free
   Grace and dying love." May our Father's free favor make your hearts
   sing concerning this and I know that this will be your tune--

   "Behold what wondrous Grace The Father has bestowed

   On sinners of a mortal race To call them sons of God!"

   Look at the text again and you will see how explicit Paul is upon one
   point. To make us see the freeness of those consolations which come to
   God's troubled people, he writes it, "Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and
   God, even our Father, which has loved us." Divine Love is the
   foundation of our consolation! No everlasting consolation could have
   visited our hearts if the Father and the Son had not loved us! I always
   feel inclined to sit down when my ministry causes me to come across the
   great Truth of God's love to His people because it is not so much a
   Truth of God to speak upon with the tongue as to enjoy in silence in
   the heart.

   I can fully understand that God should pity my misery. I can comprehend
   God's caring for my weakness. But I am filled with sacred amazement
   when I am told that He loves me! Loves me? What can there be in me for
   the Holy Spirit to love! Brothers and Sisters, what can there be in you
   that Jesus should set His heart on you? He has made us and not we
   ourselves--does the potter fall in love with his own clay? Will he die
   to save a broken vessel? There were other creatures far fairer. Why
   were angels passed by? Wonder of wonders that the Lord should love us
   poor nobodies, defiled with sin, with such evil tempers and such
   strange natures! Ah me, with such estranged natures, which is far
   worse!

   That the Lord our God should love us. That Christ should love us so as
   actually to have died for us! Jesus so loved us that He espoused our
   nature, occupied our dwelling place, the world! He took our burden of
   sin, carried our cross and laid in our grave! They say that love is
   blind--I will not say that our Redeemer's love is of that sort--far
   rather will I say that it must have been wonderfully quick-sighted love
   to have been able to perceive anything lovable in us! Yet is His love
   the source and fountain of all our mercies. He has loved us! There can
   be no question that this is free, for love is unpurchaseable!

   If a man should give all the substance of his house for love, it would
   be utterly despised. Love goes not in the market, it knows nothing of
   price, or barter--it must go forth unbribed, unhired, or not at all--in
   all cases but far more in the instance of the Eternal Love of the great
   Father and His only-begotten Son! Price and purchase for Divine Love?
   Wherein would such an insinuation fall short of blackest blasphemy? Yet
   again, observe that as if the Apostle feared that we should get away
   from this Doctrine of Grace, he added, "He has given us everlasting
   consolation and good hope through Grace."

   Some people do not like the sound of that word, "Grace." It is too
   Calvinistic. We do not care what you call it, but it is the very best
   word in the Bible next to the name of God our Savior! It is from the
   Grace of God that all our hope begins. Man as a rebel can never earn
   anything but damnation through his own merits--Grace must reign or man
   must die. Every blessing that can ever come to condemned sinners such
   as we are must come because God's great love wills it to come because,
   "He is gracious and full of compassion." All other roads are broken up!
   Grace alone bridges the chasm and makes a way for traffic between
   Heaven and earth! Grace reigns in our spiritual comfort and only Grace!
   Let us glorify God for it.

   Everlasting consolation is not a blessing given to us as the result of
   our own works. This is most clear from the last part of our text, for
   there it is asked that the Lord may comfort our hearts, not because we
   are established in every good word and work, but that we may be so. All
   the good works which adorn the Christian character are the result of
   God's Grace and not the cause of it. Grace is given us in order that we
   may serve God, not because we do serve God. To make us holy is the
   object of Divine Grace, but Grace did not wait until it found us holy,
   or it would never have visited us. To close this part of the subject I
   would remark that this is the reason why the consolations which God
   gives us are everlasting. Dwell on that word, "everlasting." Do not
   suffer anyone to fritter away its meaning. You may safely forget that
   there are certain folks alive who declare that everlasting has not the
   meaning of endless duration, for it means that or nothing! We have too
   much personal interest involved in this word to allow it to be toned
   down into age-lasting or any other miserable sense.

   We should as soon think that the Bible meant the opposite of what it
   seems to do as believe that everlasting means something temporary. He
   has given us everlasting consolation and the reason why it is
   everlasting is because it is founded on the Grace of God! If it were
   built upon our merits it would stand upon a foundation of ice or
   mist--it would rest on a shadow buttressed by a dream. But if God loved
   us out of pure Grace and if Jesus Christ has given us consolation out
   of pure love and if our whole comfort rests upon the Sovereign Grace of
   God in Christ Jesus, then there is no reason why it

   should ever pass away unless God's Grace can evaporate, which cannot
   be, since God changes not, but must be forever-more the same! Our Lord
   Jesus changes not, for He is the "same yesterday, today and forever."

   Ah, you high-fliers who derive a lofty comfort from your feelings, your
   happy sensations, your holy works and your belief that sin is dead in
   you, fly away as much as you can--you will be brought down one of these
   days! Like Icarus in the Grecian fable who flew so high that he melted
   the wax of his wings and fell, so will it be with all who venture aloft
   on wings of self-confidence. He who lies humbly at God's feet,
   conscious of his sin and mourning over it and resting for everything
   upon Sovereign Grace and free mercy in Christ Jesus, he may stay where
   he is with safety, for his hope shall never fail him. Let the Lord be
   magnified for this! He is our Rock and there is no unfaithfulness in
   Him and he that rests in Him shall not be ashamed or confused world
   without end.

   III. So far have we come--now for our closing point which is a
   practical one. SINCE THESE CONSOLATIONS OF GOD'S LOVE HAVE BEEN SO
   FREELY BESTOWED UPON US, THEY SHOULD LEAD US TO A LIFE OF HOLY
   BENEVOLENCE. We ought to be free in our giving to others since God has
   been so free in His giving to us. As He has abounded toward us in
   infinite liberality, we ought to abound towards all with whom we come
   in contact up to the full measure of our ability in all love and
   kindness and mercy. In every benevolent enterprise Christian men should
   take a hearty interest. Read that 17th verse--"Comfort your hearts and
   establish you in every good word and work."

   I am a man and being a man everything that concerns men concerns me. I
   am a Christian man and as a follower of Christ, the Son of Man,
   everything that can do good to my fellow men is a matter in which I
   delight to take my share. This should be done in direct actions as well
   as in words. Read--"Establish you in every good word and work." Certain
   of the oldest manuscripts run, "In every good work and word" and I
   suppose in our new translation we shall have it so and very properly,
   too. In this case work is probably first and word next.

   Some Christian people think that "word" should be everything and work
   nothing, but the Scriptures are not of their mind. These professors
   speak a great deal about what they will do; talk a great deal about
   what other people ought to do and a great deal more about what others
   fail to do--and so they go on with word, word, word and nothing else
   but word. They do not get as far as "work"--but the Apostle put work
   first in this case, as much as to say, "whether you talk about it or
   not, do it. Be established in every good work even if you do not get so
   far as being capable of a multiplicity of words."

   Brethren, let us yoke word and work together--every good thing should
   command our advocacy and secure our aid to the fullest of our ability.
   Direct practical assistance should be rendered by us all, since our
   Lord loves not in word, only, but in deed and in truth. This should be
   done without pressure. No one could lay constraint upon God to bless
   His people. No pressure was put upon Christ to redeem us! Everything,
   as we have shown, was spontaneous, sovereign, free. Even so should men
   give to God out of an overflowing heart. Give to Him as a king gives to
   a king! How does a king give? Why, as he likes and that is the way to
   give--to give because you are delighted to give--not because you feel
   obliged to do it by being observed by others, but out of a royal heart
   which delights in liberal giving!

   Shall you not do as you will with your own? How can a gracious heart
   better please itself than by doing good? Give as you would give to a
   king, for we never give our meaner possessions to royal personages--we
   give the best we have if we give them anything. Let it be so in all the
   services that we render to God! Let Him have our best, our noblest, our
   dearest possessions. The particular case before us this morning is, to
   my mind, a very important one and one which should greatly move all
   generous spirits. In this great city of near upon four millions
   inhabitants, the provision of hospital accommodation is, to a painful
   degree, small.

   In those hospitals which will be helped by the collections of today, I
   think there are only 5,531 beds, or about one for every 723 persons.
   Considering the liability of working men to disease and accident and
   the great number of the poorer classes, this is a fearfully small
   preparation for possible necessity. But this is not the worst, for out
   of these 5,000 beds, as I gather from an admirable paper in The Lancet,
   there are never more than 3,232 in daily use, thus diminishing the
   supply to an appalling extent! These empty beds are very largely made
   so by the lamentable fact that the hospitals have not the means of
   using them. The depression in trade has been felt by our free hospitals
   to such an extent that they live from hand to mouth in a manner which
   is not honorable to one of the wealthiest cities in the world.

   The Hospital Sunday Collection has not yet come up to the proper mark
   and it is time for ministers to say so and instruct their people, who,
   if they knew the need, would promptly supply it. The Lancet wisely says
   that if the sermons of

   today could be preached in the hospitals, themselves, the collections
   would be doubled. There are many objections to carrying out the
   suggestion, but I have no doubt the result would be as anticipated.
   Suppose me, then, to be preaching in one of the great wards and
   yourselves to be standing among the beds. I know those poor creatures
   lying near you writhing in pain and those others grateful for the
   relief they have received would plead much more forcibly than I can!
   The sight of suffering is the best argument with benevolence.

   Look at the rows of sick folk and let your heart be touched. As the
   service could not well be held in the hospital, The Lancet suggests
   that the ministers should spend Saturday in visiting a hospital. I
   could not very well do that, but I have tried in my mind, vividly, to
   realize the scene and I think most of you are quite as able to draw the
   picture as I am, for you have been there to see for yourselves--and
   some of you have been there as patients to partake, for yourselves, in
   hospital benefits. Picture the wards of mercy and let every sick person
   there entreat you to help the funds of these admirable institutions.

   An exceedingly powerful plea to my mind arises from those empty beds.
   There they are, 2,000 of them! Waiting to be couches of hope to the
   suffering! Alas, they cannot be filled because there is not the means
   for providing the people with food and nourishment while they are
   there. Sorrowful necessity! I cannot endure to think of it. A bed for a
   sick man rendered useless by some one's meanness! Where is the
   tightwad? Surely he is not here! It would be even more painful to go to
   the homes where those persons who ought to occupy those empty beds are
   pining for the need of hospital help, waiting the next turn--which turn
   may find them in the grave--but which turn would come tomorrow morning
   if funds were forthcoming. Must they lie there till they are beyond the
   reach of surgical help because the wealthy of this so-called Christian
   city cannot spare a little from their luxuries to furnish poor sick
   humans with nutriment?

   that one with a trumpet tongue could speak to our nobles, our
   merchants, our traders, our gentlemen of leisure and bid them consider
   the sick poor! O that they all knew the exquisite luxury of doing good!
   I would say to employers, will you let these people lie and pine away
   for lack of medical help, many of them your workmen whose strength has
   been spent in your trades and handicrafts? Pain is crushing them and
   provision is made for their help and cure, as far as it can be made,
   but it is rendered useless by the need of money to bear the expenses of
   the patients! Is this to be always so? Is this to remain so for another
   year? Surely it shall not be!

   1 ask you, dear Friends, according as God has entrusted you with this
   world's wealth, to help the hospitals! I do this with all the greater
   confidence because you are Believers in the Doctrines of Free Grace.
   Give freely, for you have received freely! Remember that yesterday and
   today Jews, Catholics, Protestants, people of all sects have heartily
   joined in this common effort for suffering humanity and if those who
   believe in the Free Grace of God are behind-hand--no--if they are not
   among the foremost in the race, it will be to the dishonor of the
   glorious Gospel which they profess! The Lord accept your offerings as
   you now present them!

   I hear the sound of your gold and silver already, for you are eager in
   the work of mercy. The collectors are a little too rapid in their work,
   but I will not restrain them, for it is a fit ending to my discourse
   that you should hasten to pass from word to work. In so doing may God
   bless you. Amen.

The Sheep Before The Shearers

   (No. 1543)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, JUNE 20, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "As a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He opens not His mouth."
   Isaiah 53:7.

   It is very suggestive of the way in which our Lord Jesus took the
   sinner's place that we are here, in the context, compared to
   sheep--"All we like sheep have gone astray," and then He who comes to
   take our place is also compared to a sheep--"As a sheep before her
   shearers is dumb." It is wonderful how complete was the interchange of
   positions between Christ and His people so that what they were He
   became in order that what He is they may become! See how closely He
   became like His brethren? I can very well understand how we should be
   compared to the sheep and He to the shepherd, but I should never have
   dared to coin the comparison which likens Him to a sheep! I dare try to
   explain, but I should never have dared to utter it if I had not found
   it here.

   To liken the Son of the Highest to a sheep would have been unpardonable
   presumption had not His own Spirit employed the condescending figure.
   Though the emblem is very gracious, it is by no means novel, for our
   Lord had been long before Isaiah's day typified in the Lamb of the
   Passover. To call Him, "the Lamb of God which takes away the sin of the
   world," is a very frequent mode of explaining to us how He made
   expiation for our transgressions and, indeed, even in His Glory He is
   the Lamb in the midst of the Throne before whom angels and the redeemed
   are bowing. I delight to bring before your minds the amazing communion
   between yourselves and Jesus--you "like sheep" and He "as a sheep"--you
   like sheep in your wanderings, He like a sheep in His patience. You
   more like sheep--I mean myself and you--more like sheep for
   foolishness, but He only like a sheep for the sweet submissiveness of
   His Spirit, so that beneath the shearer's hand, "He opens not His
   mouth."

   I will not keep you with any preface, but invite you to consider,
   first, OUR SAVIOR'S PATIENCE under the figure of a sheep before her
   shearers. Let us view our Lord's patience by the help of the Holy
   Spirit. I do not think I will preach to you, but I will set before you
   as open a window as I can and ask you to look in and behold the Lamb of
   God. Our Lord was brought to the slaughter and brought, in another
   sense, by another figure, to the shearers. He was brought to the
   slaughter that He might die--to the shearers that He might be shorn of
   His comfort and of His honors-- shorn, even, of His good name and
   shorn, at last, of life itself.

   While He was before the slaughterers He was quiet as a lamb that is
   led--when He was under the shearers He was as silent as a sheep that
   lies to be shorn. You know the story of how patient He was before
   Pilate and Herod and Caiaphas and on the Cross. You have no record of
   His groaning, or of His uttering any exclamation as though impatient of
   the pain and shame which He received at the hands of wicked men. You
   have not one bitter word, one hard speech. Pilate cries, "Answer You
   nothing? Behold how many things they witness against You!" And Herod is
   bitterly disappointed, for he expected to see some miracle worked by
   Jesus. All that He says is like the bleating of a sheep, only so
   infinitely more full of meaning. He utters sentences likes these--"For
   this purpose was I born and came into the world, that I might bear
   witness to the Truth" and, "Father, forgive them, for they know not
   what they do." He is all patience and silence.

   Now remember, first, that our Lord was silent and opened not His mouth
   against His adversaries and did not accuse one of them of cruelty or
   injustice. They slandered Him, but He replied not. False witnesses
   arose, but He answered them not. He did not say, like Paul, "God shall
   smite you, you white wall." I am not going to condemn Paul, but I
   certainly am not going to commend him, either. In contrast with the
   Master, how differently he behaves! Jesus lets not fall a word against
   anybody, though they are doing everything that malice can invent
   against Him. For Pilate He even makes a half apology, "He that
   delivered Me unto you has the greater sin."

   One would have thought He must have spoken when they spat in His face.
   Might He not have said, "Friend, why are you doing this? For which of
   all My works do you insult Me?" But the time for such expostulations
   was over. When they struck Him on the face with the palms of their
   hands, it would have been understandable if He had said, "Why do you
   strike Me so?" But no, He speaks not. He brings no accusation to His
   Father. He had only to have lifted His eyes to Heaven, or to have felt
   a wrathful wish and legions of angels would have chased out the ribald
   soldiers--one flash of a seraph's wing and Herod had been eaten by
   worms and Pilate had died the death he well deserved as an unjust
   judge!

   The hill of the Cross might have become a volcano's mouth to swallow up
   the whole multitude who stood there jesting and jeering at Him. But no,
   nothing of the kind--there was no display of power, or rather there was
   so great a display of power over Himself that He did not use His might
   against His most bitter foes! He restrained Omnipotence, itself, with a
   strength which can never be measured, for His mighty love availed even
   to restrain Divine Wrath! He kept back the natural indignation which
   must have come over His spirit against the injustice, the lies, the
   shameful malice of His foes. He held it all back and was patient, meek,
   silent to the end.

   Again, as He did not utter a word against His adversaries, so He did
   not say a word against any one of us. You remember how Zipporah said to
   Moses, "Surely a bloody husband you are to me," as she saw her child
   bleeding? And surely Jesus might have said to His Church, "You are a
   costly spouse to Me, to bring Me all this shame and blood shedding."
   But He gives liberally, He opens the very fountain of His heart and He
   upbraids not. He had reckoned on the uttermost expenditure and endured
   the Cross, despising the shame--

   "This was compassion like a God, That when the Savior knew The price of
   pardon was His blood, His pity never withdrew."

   No doubt He looked across the ages, for those eyes of His were not dim
   even when bloodshot on the Cross and He might have looked at your
   indifference and mine, at our coldness of heart and unfaithfulness--and
   He might have left on record some such words as these--"I am suffering
   for those who are utterly unworthy of My regard; their love will be a
   very poor return for Mine. Though I give My whole heart for them, how
   lukewarm is their love to Me! I am sick of them. I am weary of them and
   it is woe to Me that I should be laying down My heart's blood for such
   a worthless race as these, My people, are."

   But there is not a hint of such a feeling, not a trace of it! He is
   silent before the shearers. They shear away everything from Him. They
   strip Him to the last rag, till, as He hangs upon the tree, He says, "I
   can count all My bones, they look and stare upon Me," and yet He
   murmurs not against our cruel sins! He was stripped because we were
   naked, that He might cover our nakedness and yet He makes no complaint
   against us, nor utters a single syllable by way of regret that He had
   entered upon so severe an enterprise and that He was paying so heavy a
   price. No. "For the joy that was set before Him He endured the Cross,
   despising the shame," and not a syllable is uttered that looks like
   murmuring, or wishing that He had not commenced the work.

   And again, as there was not a word against His adversaries, nor a word
   against you or me, so there was not a word against His Father or of
   repining at the severity of the punishment of our sin. You know how
   Cain said, "My punishment is greater than I can bear," and yet to me he
   seems to have been treated with strange leniency, that first red-handed
   murderer. Sometimes you and I have cried, when under a comparatively
   light grief, "Surely my grief cannot be weighed in the scales, nor
   measured in the balances!" We have thought ourselves treated very
   harshly. We have dared to cry out against God, "My face is foul with
   weeping and on my eyelids is the shadow of death; not for any injustice
   in my hands: also my prayer is pure."

   But not so the Savior. In His mouth were no complaints. And yet it is
   quite impossible for us to conceive how the Father pressed and bruised
   Him. How often did that olive press revolve? How was the screw
   tightened again and again and again, to bring the stones together, to
   bruise out of Him His very life! "It pleased the Lord to bruise Him; He
   has put Him to grief." He, alone, of all mankind could truly say, "All
   Your waves and Your billows have gone over Me." Yet there is not a
   complaint, for, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" is a cry of
   grief--it is not a cry of repining. It shows manhood in its weakness,
   but not manhood in revolt! There is the cry of grief, but there is not
   the voice of rebellion there, nor even of despair.

   We have the Lamentations of Jeremiah, but where are the lamentations of
   Jesus? Jesus wept and Jesus sweated great drops of blood, but He never
   murmured nor felt rebellion in His heart. Beloved, I feel as if I
   cannot preach upon this, but ask you just to look in there, within the
   open door and see Jesus, the Lamb, waiting in the shambles. He is not
   struggling when the knife is at His throat, but waiting there to die
   and dying with His own consent--laying down His life willingly for our
   sakes. Look again and see your Lord and Savior lying down stretched out
   in passive resignation beneath the shearers as they take away
   everything that is dear to Him and yet He opens not His mouth!

   I see in this, in Christ our Lord, complete submission. He gives
   Himself up. There is no reserve about it. The Sacrifice did not need
   binding with cords to the horns of the altar. How different from your
   case and mine! He stands there willing to suffer, to be spit upon, to
   be shamefully treated and to die, for in Him there was a complete
   surrender. There was no reserve about His body, soul, or spirit. He was
   wholly given up to do the Father's will and work out our redemption.
   There was a complete self-conquest, too. In Him no faculty arose to
   plead for liberty and ask to be exempted from the general strain. No
   limb of the body, no portion of the mind, no faculty of the spirit
   complained--all submitted--a whole Christ giving up His whole being
   unto God that He might perfectly offer Himself without spot for our
   redemption.

   There was not only self-conquest, but there was a complete absorption
   in His work. The sheep, lying there, thinks no more of the pastures. It
   just gives itself up to the shearer. And Christ forsook His Father that
   He might be one flesh with us--that was at the very first and,
   therefore, He came here and was joined unto us at Bethlehem. He kept up
   the union to the end and, therefore, He was one with us in death. The
   zeal of God's house did eat Him up in Pilate's hall as well as
   everywhere else, for there He witnessed a good confession. No thought
   had He but for the clearing of the Divine honor and the salvation of
   God's elect.

   His powers were concentrated into one desire and the passion of love to
   men made His heart hot within Him till it melted and ran out in a
   stream of love and blood. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, I wish we could
   always get to this--to submit our whole spirit to God, to resign
   ourselves completely, to learn self-conquest and then the delivering up
   of conquered self entirely to God--the absorption of it all in one
   desire, the burning up of the sacrifice till it should be like Elijah's
   sacrifice on Carmel when the fire came down from Heaven and consumed
   not only the bullock, but the wood and the stones of the altar and
   licked up the water that was in the trenches and the whole sacrifice
   went up in one vast cloud of fire and smoke to Heaven, a whole burnt
   offering to the living God!

   This is just what one could wish might happen to us, even as it
   happened unto the Lord's Christ on that day. The wonderful serenity and
   submissiveness of our Lord are still better set forth by our text, if
   it is, indeed, true that sheep in the east are even more docile than
   with us. Those who have seen the noise and roughness of many of our
   washings and shearings will hardly believe the testimony of that
   ancient writer Philo-Judaeus when he affirms that the sheep came
   voluntarily to be shorn. He says--"Wooly rams laden with thick fleeces
   put themselves into his hands [the shepherd's] to have their wool
   shorn, being thus accustomed to pay their yearly tribute to man, their
   king by nature. The sheep stands in a silent inclining posture,
   unconstrained under the hand of the shearer. These things may appear
   strange to those who do not know the docility of the sheep, but they
   are true."

   II. Thus I have very feebly, indeed, set before you, dear Friends, the
   patience of our beloved Master. Now I want you to follow me, in the
   second place, to view our own case under the same metaphor as that
   which is used in reference to our Lord. Did not I begin by saying that
   because we were sheep, He deigns to compare Himself to a sheep? Now,
   just go back again. Our Lord was as a sheep under the shearers and as
   He is, so are we, also, in this world. Though we shall never be offered
   up like a lamb in the temple by way of expiation, yet the saints, for
   ages, were the flock of slaughter, as it is written, "For Your sake we
   are killed all the day long, we are accounted as sheep for the
   slaughter!" Jesus sends us forth as sheep in the midst of wolves and we
   are to regard ourselves as living sacrifices, ready to be offered up.

   I dwell, however, more particularly upon the second symbol--we can go
   and do go as sheep under the shearers' hands. I want to speak to you a
   little, this evening, about this figure, as I have no doubt it has been
   worked out in the lives of many here present and may perhaps be worked
   out at this present time and in future days in the rest of you. Just as
   a sheep is taken by the shearer and its wool is all cut off, so does
   the Lord take His people and shear them, taking away all their comforts
   at times--all their earthly comforts and leaving them bare as shorn
   sheep. I wish when it came to our turn to undergo this shearing
   operation it could be said of us as of our Lord, "As a sheep before her
   shearers, so He opens not His mouth."

   I fear that we open our mouths a great deal and make no end of
   complaint. But now to the figure. We need to be reconciled to the
   shearing process and to that end I shall speak at this time. First,
   remember that a sheep rewards its owner for all his care and trouble by
   being shorn. There is nothing else that I know of that a sheep can do.
   It yields food when it is killed, but while it is alive the one payment
   that the sheep can make to the shepherd is to yield its fleece in due
   season. And so, dear Friends, a sheep, if it were intelligent, might
   well be reconciled to be shorn because it would say, "The shepherd
   deserves to be rewarded for his pains and so I am content to go down to
   the shearing house, to yield my fleece that he may be repaid."

   Some of God's people can give to Christ a tribute of gratitude by
   active service and they should do so gladly every day of their lives,
   but many others cannot do much in active service and about the only
   reward they can give to their Lord is to give up their fleece by
   suffering when He calls upon them to suffer. They can submissively
   yield to be shorn of their personal comfort when the time comes for
   patient endurance. And mark you, those who serve Christ actively ought
   to feel that what they do in that way is all too little and if they can
   supplement it by passive service, by yielding themselves to be shorn as
   others are, they ought to rejoice that in this way they can show forth
   to Christ the more abundant gratitude for what He has done for them.

   Here comes the shearer. He takes the sheep and begins to cut, cut, cut,
   cut, taking away the wool by wholesale. Affliction is often used as the
   big shears. The husband is taken away, or perhaps the wife. Little
   children are taken away, property is taken away, health is taken away.
   Sometimes the shears even cut off your good name--slander comes--
   everything seems to come and remove your consolations till all comforts
   vanish. Well, this is your shearing time and it may be that you are not
   able to glorify God to any very large extent except by undergoing this
   process. And if this is the case, do you not think that you and I, like
   good sheep of Christ, should surrender cheerfully and say, "I lay
   myself down with this intent, that You should take from me anything and
   everything and do what You will with me, for I am not my own--I am
   bought with a price and so I would cheerfully yield to anything by
   which You may get some honor out of me.

   "O, You great Shepherd of the sheep, clip and shear me as You will, so
   long as You see some sort of return for all Your tender care and bitter
   woe." Notice that the sheep is, itself, benefited by the operation of
   shearing. Before they begin to shear the sheep the wool is long and old
   and every bush that catches it, every thistle with which it gets
   entangled, every briar that it passes by, tears off a bit of the wool
   and the sheep looks ragged and forlorn. If the wool were left on it
   when the heat of summer came, it would not able to bear it--it would be
   so overloaded with clothing that it would be as we, ourselves, are when
   we have kept on our borrowed wool, our flannels and broadcloths too
   late.

   After the heat of summer has come we have to throw off our thick
   clothes. We cannot bear them--and so the sheep is the better for losing
   its wool--it would become a hindrance to it and not a comfort if it had
   to retain it. So, Brothers and Sisters, when the Lord shears us, we do
   not like the operation any more than the sheep does, but first, it is
   for His Glory and secondly, it is really for our benefit and,
   therefore, we are bound most willingly to submit. There are many things
   which we should have liked to have kept which, if we had kept them,
   would not have proved blessings, but curses. Remember, a stale blessing
   is a curse.

   The bronze serpent preserved as a relic became a snare to the people
   till it was broken up and called Nehushtan, a piece of brass. The
   manna, though it came from Heaven, was only good so long as God's
   command made it a blessing and when they kept it over its due time it
   bred worms and stank and then it was no blessing. I do believe that
   many persons, if they could, would keep their blessings stinking in the
   house till they filled their cupboards with worms! But God will not
   have it so. Up to a certain point for you to be wealthy was a
   blessing--it would not have been a blessing any longer and so the Lord
   took your riches away. Up to that point your child was a gift, but it
   would have been no longer so and, therefore, it fell sick and died. You
   may not be able to see it, but it must certainly be that God, when He
   withdraws a blessing from His people, takes it away because it would
   not be a blessing any longer.

   Remember this text, "No good thing will I withhold from them that walk
   uprightly," and if that is true, then this is true, "No really good
   thing will I take away from them that walk uprightly," for that is
   something more than withholding. When the wool goes, it is because the
   sheep does not really need it--it is better without it. Mr. Jonatt, who
   has written upon sheep, tells us, "As the spring advances, the old wool
   is no longer needed to defend the animal from the cold and it becomes,
   from its weight and its warmth, a nuisance rather than a comfort." When
   the Lord Jesus Christ sends afflic-

   tion and trial to shear us, while we hope to glory Him in the process,
   it is also good for us that we should have it cut away. Though we do
   not like it at the time, it is working our lasting good.

   You who know something about sheep will remember that before sheep are
   shorn they are always washed. Were you ever present at the scene when
   they drive them down to the brook, to the place where they have dammed
   up the stream to make a pool for washing? There the men stand in rows,
   while the shepherd stands in the water, breast high. The sheep are
   driven down and the men seize them, throw them into the water, keeping
   their faces above water and swill them round and round and round to
   wash the wool before they clip it off. You see them come out on the
   other side frightened to death, poor things, wondering whatever is
   coming, no doubt under the impression that they are going to be
   drowned. And when they escape, they stand bleating on the other shore
   as, one by one, they finish their swim.

   I want to suggest to you, Brethren, that whenever a trial threatens to
   overtake you, before it actually arrives you should ask the Lord to
   sanctify you. If He is going to clip the wool, ask Him to wash it
   before He takes it off. Ask to be cleansed in spirit, soul and body.
   That is a very good custom Christian people have of asking a blessing
   on their meals before they eat bread. Do you not think it is even more
   necessary to ask a blessing on our troubles before we get into them?
   Here is your dear child likely to die--will you not, dear parents, meet
   together and ask God to bless the death of that child if it is to
   happen? Here are things going badly in trade--would it not be a good
   thing to hold a special meeting in the family and ask God to bless your
   declining business to you? There is a bad crop. The harvest
   fails--would it not be well to say, "Lord, sanctify this poverty, this
   loss, this year's bad harvest. Cause it to be a means of Grace to us.
   The evil is coming and before it comes we would ask a blessing on it."

   Why not ask a blessing on the cup of bitterness as well as upon the cup
   of thanksgiving? Ask to be washed before you are shorn and if the
   shearing must come, let that be your chief concern. "Lord, if You are
   coming to take my wool, make it clean before You take it. Wash what You
   take and wash me, also, and I shall be clean. Yes, wash me and I shall
   be whiter than snow." After the washing and the sheep has dried, the
   sheep actually loses what was its comfort. It is thrown down and you
   see the shearers. You wonder at them and pity the poor sheep. The sheep
   is losing what was its comfort. It will happen to you that you shall
   lose what is your comfort. Will you remember this? Because the next
   time you receive a fresh comfort you must say it is a loan.

   Oh sheep, there is no wool on your back but what will come off! Child
   of God, there is no comfort in your possession but what will either
   leave you, or you will leave it! Nothing is our own except our God.
   "Why," says one, "not our sin?" That was our own, I admit that, but
   Jesus has taken that upon Himself and we call it no more our own. There
   is nothing our own but our God and there is no blessing that we have
   but what, when the Lord sends it to us, it is with the agreement that
   we shall have it only for a time. It is held on lease, terminable at
   the will of the Lord. We foolishly consider that our mercies belong to
   us and when the Lord takes them away we half grumble. If you borrow
   anything of a neighbor, you ought not to send it back with tears, or
   say, "I am sorry you need it back."

   A loan, they say, should go laughing home and so should what God loans
   us. We should rejoice. He gives and, blessed be His name, He takes but
   what He gave. He does not take to Himself anything of ours--He takes to
   Himself what He lent us. All our possessions are but favors borrowed
   here to be eventually returned. So as the sheep yields up its wool and
   loses its comfort, so must we yield up all our comforts one by one. Or
   if they remain with us till we die, we shall part with them, then--we
   shall not take so much as one of them across the stream of death. Our
   spiritual riches are of another kind and they are laid up already in
   Heaven--but of all things here below we shall take not a thread with
   us.

   The shearers, when they are taking the wool off the sheep, take care
   not to hurt the sheep. They clip as close as they can, but they do not
   cut the skin. If possible, they will not make a gash or a wound, or
   draw blood even in the smallest degree. When they do make a gash, it is
   because the sheep does not lie still. But a careful shearer has
   bloodless shears. Of this Thomson sings in his Seasons and the passage
   is so good an illustration of the whole subject that I will adorn my
   discourse with it--

   "How meek, how patient, the mild creature lies! What softness in its
   melancholy face, What dumb complaining innocence appears! Fear not, you
   gentle tribes! 'tis not the knife Of horrid slaughter that is o'er you
   waved. No, 'tis the tender swain's well guided shears,

   Who having no w, to pay his annual care, Borrowed your fleece, to you a
   cumbrous load, Will send you bounding to your hills again." You can be
   sure that when the Lord is clipping and shearing us He will not hurt
   us. He will take our comforts away, but He will not really injure us,
   or cause a wound to our spirits. Has He not said, "In the world you
   shall have tribulation, but in Me you shall have peace"?

   If ever the shears make us bleed, it is because we kick, because we
   struggle. If we were patient as the sheep, we should just lie still and
   the process would cost us very little pain. What pain there was would
   become delightful, seeing we had submitted ourselves entirely to the
   Divine will. Pain grows into pleasure when you come to feel that God
   wills it--you are glad to suffer because He ordains you should. It is
   the kicking and the struggling that make the shearing work at all hard.
   But if we are silent before the shearers, no hurt can come. The Lord
   may clip wonderfully close--I have known Him clip some very close who
   did not seem to have a bit of wool left, for they were stripped
   entirely, just as Job was when He cried, "Naked came I out of my
   mother's womb and naked shall I return there," but still, he was able
   to add, "The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away and blessed be the
   name of the Lord."

   You will notice about sheep shearing that the shearers always shear at
   a suitable time. It would be a very wicked, cruel and unwise thing to
   begin shearing sheep in winter time. There is a proverb which talks
   about God "tempering the wind to the shorn lamb." It may be so, but it
   is a very wicked practice to shear lambs while winds need tempering.
   Sheep are shorn when it is warm, genial weather--when they can afford
   to lose their fleece and are all the better for being relieved of it.
   As the summer comes on sheep shearing time comes. Have you ever noticed
   that whenever the Lord afflicts us, He selects the best possible time?
   There is a prayer that He puts into His disciples' mouths, "Pray that
   your flight is not in the winter"--the spirit of that prayer may be
   seen in the seasonableness of our sorrows. He will not send us our
   worst troubles at our worst times.

   I have frequently noticed and I have treasured it up with gratitude,
   that when I have had strong inclinations to sin, the opportunity has
   not come--that if ever I have had opportunities of sinning temptingly
   put before me--then I have had no inward longing towards the sin. When
   the inward desire and the opportunity meet, that is a very dangerous
   case, indeed, but the Lord keeps His people from that. So if you notice
   your soul is depressed, the Lord does not send you a very heavy burden
   but reserves such a load for times when you have had joy in the Lord
   and that joy has been your strength. It has got to be a kind of feeling
   with us that when we have much delight, a trial is near--and when
   sorrow thickens, deliverance is approaching. The Lord does not send us
   two burdens at a time, or if He does, He sends double strength.

   It is an observation which I suppose no one would make but an Irishman
   and I am not one, that you never knew the west wind blow when the east
   wind is troubling you. You never knew the wind blow from the north when
   it was blowing from the south. As a rule, unless it is in a tornado or
   a cyclone, the wind blows from some one quarter. "He stays His rough
   wind in the day of the east wind." He knows how to prevent our
   suffering more tribulation than we can bear. He shears us, but not to
   injure us. He clips away the wool, but sends the genial temperature so
   that we may be able to flourish under our loss. Let that be noted and
   let God be thanked for it.

   There is another thing to remember. When God takes away our mercies He
   is ready to supply us with more. It is with us as with the sheep--there
   is new wool coming. Whenever the Lord takes away our earthly comforts
   with one hand, one, two, three--He restores with the other hand--six,
   12, scores, a hundred! He takes away by spoonfuls and He gives by
   carloads! We are crying and whining about the little loss and yet it is
   necessary in order that we may be able to receive the great mercy! Yes,
   it will be so--we shall yet have cause for rejoicing--"joy comes in the
   morning." There is always as good fish in the sea as ever came out of
   it and when one set of favors is taken away there are more mercies to
   come. The great sea of Divine Love has bigger fish in it than ever we
   have taken out of it. If we have lost one position, there is another
   position for us.

   If we have been driven out of one place, there is yet a refuge for us.
   God opens a second door when He shuts the first. If He takes away the
   manna, as He did from His people Israel, it is because there is the
   corn of Canaan for them to live on. If the water of the Rock did not
   follow the tribes any longer, it was because they could drink of the
   Jordan and of the

   brooks that flowed in that land of hills and valleys. Yes, there is new
   wool coming! Do not, therefore, fret at the shearing. I have given
   these thoughts in brief, that we may come to this last word.

   III. Let us, in the third place, endeavor to imitate the example of our
   blessed Lord when our turn comes to be shorn. Let us be silent before
   the shearers, submissive, quiescent, even as He was. I have been
   giving, in everything I have said, a reason for so doing. I have shown
   that it glorifies God, rewards the Shepherd and benefits ourselves. I
   have shown that He measures and tempers our affliction and sends the
   trial at the right time. I have shown you in many ways that we are wise
   to submit ourselves as the sheep does to the shearer and the more
   completely we do so the better. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, we shall be
   happy when we have done with self! It will be well with us, whatever we
   may have gone through, when we learn that verse of Toplady's--

   "Sweet to lie passive in Your hands And know no will but Yours."

   I know we struggle a good deal and we make excuses for struggling.
   Sometimes we say, "Oh, this is so painful, I cannot be patient! I could
   have borne anything else, but not this." When a father is going to
   correct his child, does he select something that is pleasant? Oh, dear,
   no! The painfulness of the chastisement is the essence of it and even
   so the bitterness of your sorrow will be a blessing to you. By the
   blueness of the wound the heart will be made better. Do not rebel
   because your trial seems strange. It is as good as saying, "If I have
   it all my own way I will not rebel, but if everything does not please
   me I will not endure it."

   Sometimes we complain because of our great weakness. "Lord, were I
   stronger I would not mind this heavy loss. I am like a sere leaf driven
   by the storm." But who is to be the judge of the suitability of your
   trial? You or God? Since the Lord judges this trial to be suitable to
   your weakness, depend upon it, it is so. Lie still, lie still, lie
   quite still! "Alas," you say, "my grief comes from the most cruel
   quarter. This trouble did not arise directly from God, it came through
   my cousin or my brother who ought to have treated me with gratitude. I
   could have borne it if it had not come in that way, but since it was
   not an enemy, I am unable to bear it!" Then let me tell you, it is not
   a traitor, after all. God is at the bottom of all your
   tribulation--look through the second causes to the great First Cause!

   It is a great mistake when we fret over the human instrument which
   smites us and forget the hand which uses the rod. If I strike a dog
   with a stick, he bites my stick--that is because he is stupid. If he
   thought a little, he would bite me, or else take the blow and bow in
   obedience. Now, you must not begin biting the stick! After all, it is
   God that uses that staff, though it is of ebony or of blackthorn. It is
   well to have done with all this picking and choosing and to leave the
   whole matter in the hands of Infinite Wisdom. A sweet singer has put
   this matter very prettily, let me quote the lines--

   "But when my Lord did ask me

   On what side I were content,

   The grief whereby I must be purified,

   To me was sent,

   As each imagined anguish did appear, Each withering bliss Before my
   soul, I cried, 'Oh! Spare me here, Oh, no, not this!' Like one that
   having need of, Deep within, the surgeon's knife, Would hardly bear
   that It should graze the skin, Though for his life. No, then, but He,
   who Best does understand Both what we need, And what can bear, Did take
   my case in hand, Nor crying heed.

   This is the pith of my sermon--oh sheep, yield yourself, yield
   yourself! Oh Believer, yield yourself, lie passive, lie passive,
   struggle not! There is no use in struggling, for our great Shearer, if
   He means to shear, will do it. If He means to send us trials and
   troubles He will not spare us for our crying. He will not listen to our
   whining--He will do His will and carry out His purpose. What is the
   good, therefore, of rebellion? Did not I say, just now, that the sheep,
   by struggling, might be cut by the shears? So you and I, if we struggle
   against God, we shall get two troubles instead of one and after all,
   there is not half so much trouble in a trouble as there is in our
   kicking against the trouble!

   The Eastern farmer, when he plows, has a goad and pricks the ox to make
   it move along. He does not hurt it much, but suppose the ox flings out
   the moment it touches him? He drives the goad into himself and bleeds.
   So is it with us. If we kick out against Divine Providences, we shall
   get a sore wound--much more than was ever necessary--we shall endure
   much more pain than would have come if we had yielded to the Divine
   will. What is the use of kicking and struggling, then, you fretful
   ones? You cannot make one hair white or black. You that are troubled,
   rest with us, for you cannot make shower or sunshine, rain or fine
   weather with all your groaning.

   Did you ever bring a penny into the till by fretting, or put a loaf on
   the table by complaint, or get a shilling in your pocket by murmuring?
   Murmuring is wasted breath and fretting is wasted time. I wish that I
   could be more quiet, calm and self-possessed, but an active mind is apt
   to turn upon itself to its own wounding when all the cares of a Church
   and a great work press heavily. I long to cry habitually, "Lord, do
   what You will, when You will, as You will with me, Your
   servant--appoint me honor or dishonor, wealth or poverty, sickness or
   health, exhilaration or depression and I will take all right gladly
   from Your hands." A man is not far from the gates of Heaven when he is
   fully submissive to the Lord's will.

   Though Heaven is uphill, the road to it is downhill--and when a man has
   gone down so much that he is dead to self, he is not far from entering
   into that Eternal Life where God shall be All in All, in bliss forever
   and ever. You that have been shorn have, I hope, received a word of
   comfort today through the ever blessed Spirit of God. May God bless it
   to you. Oh that the sinner, too, would submit himself to God, yield
   himself up and rebel no longer! Submit yourselves to God, let every
   thought be brought into captivity to Him and the Lord send His
   blessing, for Christ's sake. Amen.

Mahanaim--or, Hosts Of Angels

   (No. 1544)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 20, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him. And when
   Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of
   that place Mahanaim." Genesis 32:1,2.

   "And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the
   son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon and Machir the son of
   Ammiel of Lodebar and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim, brought beds
   and basins and earthen vessels and wheat and barley and flour and
   parched corn and beans and lentiles and parched seeds and honey and
   butter and sheep and cheese of kine, for David and for the people that
   were with him, to eat, for they said, The people are hungry and weary
   and thirsty in the wilderness." 2Samuel17:27229.

   LET us go even unto Mahanaim and see these great sights. First, let us
   go with Jacob and see the two camps of angels and then with David to
   observe his troops of friends. Jacob shall have our first
   consideration. What a varied experience is that of God's people! Their
   pilgrimage is over a shifting sand; their tent is always moving and the
   scene around them always changing. Here is Jacob, at one time
   contending for a livelihood with Laban, playing trick against trick in
   order to match his father-in-law. Then he prospers and determines to
   abide no more in such servitude. He flees, is pursued, debates with his
   angry relative and ends the contention with a truce and a sacrifice.
   This unseemly family warfare must have been a very unhappy thing for
   Jacob, by no means tending to raise the tone of his thoughts, or
   sweeten his temper, or ennoble his spirit.

   What a change happened to him when, the next day, after Laban had gone,
   Jacob found himself in the presence of angels! Here is a picture of a
   very different kind--the churl has gone and the cherubs have come--the
   greedy taskmaster has turned his back and the happy messengers of the
   blessed God have come to welcome the Patriarch on his return from
   exile! It is hard to realize, to the full, the complete transformation.
   Such changes occur in all lives but, I think, most of all in the lives
   of Believers. Few passages across the ocean of life are quite free from
   storm, but the redeemed of the Lord may reckon upon being tossed with
   tempest even if others escape. "Many are the afflictions of the
   righteous." Yet trials last not forever--clear shining comes after
   rain.

   Change always works. We pass from storm to calm, from breeze to
   hurricane--we coast the shores of peace and then we are driven upon the
   sandbanks of fear. Nor need we be surprised, for were there not great
   changes in the life of our Lord and Master? Is not His life as full of
   hills and valleys as ours possibly can be? We read of His being
   baptized in Jordan and then and there visited by the Spirit who
   descended upon Him like a dove--then was His hour of rest. Who can tell
   the restfulness of Jesus' spirit when the Father bore witness
   concerning Him, "This is My beloved Son"? But, we read directly
   afterwards, "Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to
   be tempted of the devil." From the descent of the Holy Spirit to dire
   conflict with the devil is a change, indeed!

   But another change followed it, for when that battle had been fought
   out and the triple temptation had been tried upon our Lord in vain, we
   read again, "Then the devil left Him and behold, angels came and
   ministered unto Him." In a short space our Lord's surroundings had
   changed from heavenly to diabolical and again from satanic to angelic.
   From Heaven to the manger, from walking the sea to hanging on the
   Cross, from the sepulcher to the Throne--what changes are these! Can we
   expect to build three tabernacles and tarry in the mountain when our
   Lord was thus tossed to and fro?

   Beloved, you will certainly find that the world is established upon the
   floods and is therefore ever moving. Never reckon upon the permanence
   of any joy and thank God you need not dread the continuance of any
   sorrow. These things

   come and go and go and come--and you and I, so far as we have to live
   in this poor whirling world, must be removed to and fro as a shepherd's
   tent and find no city to dwell in. If this happen not to our
   habitations it will certainly happen in our feelings. From of old "the
   evening and the morning were the first day" and, "the evening and the
   morning were the second day." The alternation of shade and sunshine, of
   setting and rising are from the beginning. Dawn, noon, afternoon,
   evening, darkness, midnight and a new morning follow each other in all
   things. So must it be--there is a need for clouds and showers and
   morning glories, "until the day break and the shadows flee away," when
   we shall be fitted to bask in the beams of everlasting noon.

   In the case before us we see Jacob in the best of company. Jacob, not
   cheated in Mesopotamia, but honored in Maha-naim. Jacob, not trying to
   outwit Laban, but gazing upon celestial spirits. He was surrounded by
   angels and he knew it. His eyes were open so that he saw spirits who,
   in their own nature, are invisible to human eyes. He became a Seer and
   was enabled by the inward eye to behold the hosts of shining ones whom
   God had sent to meet him. It is a great privilege to be able to know
   our friends and to discern the hosts of God. We are very apt, indeed,
   to realize our difficulties and to forget our helps. Our allies are all
   around us, yet we think ourselves alone. The opposition of Satan is
   more easily recognized than the succor of the Lord. Oh to have eyes and
   hearts opened to see how strong the Lord is on our behalf!

   Jacob had just been delivered from Laban, but he was oppressed by
   another load--the dread of Esau was upon him. He had wronged his
   brother and you cannot do a wrong without being haunted by it
   afterwards. He had taken ungenerous advantage of Esau and now, many,
   many years after it, his deed came home to him and his conscience made
   him afraid. Notwithstanding that he had lived with Laban so long, his
   conscience was sufficiently vigorous to make him tremble because he had
   put himself into a wrong position with his brother. Had it not been for
   this, he would have marched on to his father, Isaac's, tent with joyful
   feet!

   Dreading his brother's anger, he was greatly distressed and troubled.
   These angels came to bring him cheer by helping him to forget the
   difficulties round about him, or lose his dread of them by looking up
   and seeing what defense and succor awaited him from on high. He had but
   to cry to God and Esau's 400 men would be met by legions of angels! Was
   not this good cheer? Have not all Believers the same? Greater is He
   that is for us than all they that are against us! If, this morning, I
   shall be enabled by the Holy Spirit to uplift the minds of the Lord's
   tried people from their visible griefs to their invisible comforts I
   shall be glad. I beg them not to think exclusively of the burden they
   have to carry, but to remember the strength which is available for the
   carrying of it.

   If I shall cause the timorous heart to cease its dread and to trust in
   the living God who has promised to bear His servants through, I shall
   have accomplished my desire. The Lord of Hosts is with us, the God of
   Jacob is our refuge and therefore no weapon that is formed against us
   shall prosper and even the arch-enemy himself shall be bruised under
   our feet. In treating of Jacob's experience at Mahanaim we will make a
   series of observations. First, God has a multitude of servants and all
   these are on the side of Believers. "His camp is very great," and all
   the hosts in that camp are our allies. Some of these are visible agents
   and many more are invisible, but, none the less, real and powerful. The
   great army of the Lord of Hosts consists largely of unseen agents--of
   forces that are not discernible except in vision or by the eyes of
   faith.

   Jacob saw two squadrons of these invisible forces which are on the side
   of righteous men. "The angels of God met him," and he said, "This is
   God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim," (two
   camps), for there a double army of angels met him. We know that a guard
   of angels always surrounds every Believer. Ministering spirits are
   abroad, protecting the princes of the blood royal. They cannot be
   discerned by any of our senses, but they are perceptible by faith and
   they have been made perceptible to holy men of old in visions. These
   bands of angels are great in multitude, for Jacob said, "This is God's
   host"--a host means a considerable number and surely the host of God is
   not a small one.

   "The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels." We
   do not know what legions wait upon the Lord, only we read of "an
   innumerable company of angels." We look abroad in the world and
   calculate the number of persons and forces friendly to our Christian
   warfare, but these are only what our poor optics can discover--the half
   cannot be told us by such means. It may be that every star is a world,
   thronged with the servants of God who are willing and ready to dart
   like flames of fire upon Jehovah's errands of love.

   If the Lord's chosen could not be sufficiently protected by the forces
   available in one world, He has but to speak or will and myriads of
   spirits from the far-off regions of space would come thronging forward
   to guard the children of their King. As the stars of the sky, countless
   in their armies, are the invisible warriors of God. "His camp is very
   great." "Om-

   nipotence has servants everywhere." These servants of the strong God
   are all filled with power--there is not one that faints among them
   all--they run like mighty men, they prevail as men of war. A host is
   made up of valiant men, veterans, troopers, heroes, men fit for
   conflict. God's forces are exceedingly strong--nothing can stand
   against them. Whatever form they take, they are always potent, even
   when God's host is made up of grasshoppers, cankerworms and
   palmer-worms, as in the Book of Joel, none can resist them and nothing
   can escape them.

   They devoured everything! They covered the earth and even darkened the
   sun and moon. If such is the case with insects, what must be the power
   of angels? We know that they "excel in strength," as they "do His
   commandments, hearkening unto the voice of His Word." Rejoice, O
   children of God! There are vast armies upon your side and each one of
   the warriors is clothed with the strength of God! All these agents work
   in order, for it is God's host and the host is made up of beings which
   march or fly according to the order of command. "Neither shall one
   thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path." All the forces
   of Nature are loyal to their Lord. None of these mighty forces dreams
   of rebellion! From the blazing comet which flames in the face of the
   universe to the tiniest fragment of shell which lies hidden in the
   deepest ocean cave--all matter yields itself to the supreme Law which
   God has settled.

   Nor do unfallen intelligent agents mutiny against Divine decrees, but
   find their joy in rendering loving homage to their God. They are
   perfectly happy, because consecrated. They are full of delight, because
   completely absorbed in doing the will of the Most High. Oh that we
   could do His will on earth as that will is done in Heaven by all the
   heavenly ones! Observe that in this great host they were all punctual
   to the Divine command. Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met
   him. The Patriarch is no sooner astir than the hosts of God are on the
   wing. They did not linger till Jacob had crossed the frontier, nor did
   they keep him waiting when he came to the appointed rendezvous--they
   were there to the moment! When God means to deliver you, Beloved, in
   the hour of danger, you will find the appointed force ready for your
   succor.

   God's messengers are neither behind nor before their time. They will
   meet us to the inch and to the second in the time of need, therefore
   let us proceed without fear, like Jacob, going on our way even though
   an Esau with a band of desperadoes should block up the road. Those
   forces of God, too, were all engaged personally to attend upon Jacob. I
   like to set forth this thought--"Jacob went on his way and the angels
   of God met him." He did not chance to fall in with them. They did not
   happen to be on the march and so crossed the Patriarch's track. No, no!
   He went on his way and the angels of God met him with design and
   purpose. They came on purpose to meet him--they had no other
   appointment. Squadrons of angels marched to meet that one lone man! He
   was a saint, but by no means a perfect one--we cannot help seeing many
   flaws in him, even upon a superficial glance at his life and yet the
   angels of God met him.

   Perhaps in the early morning, as he rose to tend his flocks, he saw the
   skies peopled with shining ones who quite eclipsed the dawn. The
   heavens were vivid with descending lusters and the angels came upon him
   as a bright cloud, descending, as it were, upon the Patriarch. They
   glided downward from those gates of pearl, more famed than the gates of
   Thebes. They divided to the right and to the left and became two hosts.
   Perhaps the one band pitched their camp behind, as much as to say, "All
   is might in the rear, Laban cannot retain; better than the cairn of
   Mizpah is the host of God." Another squadron moved to the front as much
   as to say, " Peace, Patriarch, with regard to Esau, the red hunter and
   his armed men--we guard you in the van."

   It must have been a glorious morning for Jacob when he saw not one, but
   many morning stars! If the apparitions were seen in the dead of night,
   surely Jacob must have thought that day was come before its time! It
   was as if constellations mustered to the roll call and clouds of stars
   came floating down from the upper spheres. All came to wait upon Jacob,
   on that one man--"The angel of the Lord encamps round about them that
   fear Him," but in this case it was to one man with his family of
   children that a host was sent. The man, himself, the lone man who abode
   in covenant with God when all the rest of the world was given up to
   idols, was favored by this mark of Divine favor. The angels of God met
   him!

   One delights to think that the angels should be willing and even eager,
   troops of them, to meet one man! How vain is that voluntary humility
   and worshipping of angels which Paul so strongly condemns. Worshipping
   them seems far out of the question--the fidelity lies rather the other
   way--for they do us suit and service and are they not all ministering
   spirits sent forth to minister to them that are the heirs of salvation?
   They serve God's servants. "Unto which of the angels said He at any
   time, You are My son?" But this He has said, first, to the
   Only-Begotten and then to every Believer in

   Christ! We are the sons and daughters of the Lord God Almighty and
   these ministering ones have a charge concerning us! As it is written,
   "they shall bear you up in their hands, lest you dash your foot against
   a stone."

   I have shown you that Believers are compassed about with an innumerable
   company of angels, great in multitude, strong in power, exact in order,
   punctual in their personal attention to the children of God. Are you
   not well cared for, oh you sons of the Most High? Those forces, though
   in themselves invisible to the natural senses, are manifest to faith at
   certain times. There are times when the child of God is able to cry,
   like Jacob, "The angels of God have met me." When do such seasons
   occur? Our Mahanaims occur at much the same time as that in which Jacob
   beheld this great sight. Jacob was entering upon a more separated life.
   He was leaving Laban and the school of all those tricks of bargaining
   and bartering which belong to the ungodly world.

   He had breathed too long an unhealthy atmosphere. He was
   degenerating--the heir of the promises was becoming a man of the world.
   He was entangled with earthly things. His marriages held him fast and
   every year he seemed to get more and more rooted to Laban's land. It
   was time he was transplanted to better soil. Now he is coming right
   away. He has taken to tent life. He has come to sojourn in the land of
   promise, as his fathers had done before him. He was now to confess that
   he was seeking a city and meant to be a pilgrim till he found it. By a
   desperate stroke he cut himself clear of entanglements, but he must
   have felt lonely and as one cast adrift. He missed all the associations
   of the old house of Mesopotamia, which, despite its annoyances, was his
   home.

   The angels come to congratulate him. Their presence said, "You are come
   to this land to be stranger and sojourner with God, as all your fathers
   were. We have, some of us, talked with Abraham, again and again and we
   are now coming to smile on you. You remember how we bade you goodbye
   that night, when you had a stone for your pillow at Bethel? Now you
   have come back to the reserved inheritance over which we are set as
   guardians and we have come to salute you. Take up the non-conforming
   life without fear, for we are with you. Welcome! Welcome! We are glad
   to receive you under our special care."

   Then was it true to Jacob, "Verily I say unto you, there is no man that
   has left house, or brother, or sister, or father, or mother, or wife,
   or children, or lands for My sake, but he shall receive an hundred-fold
   now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and
   children and lands, with persecutions and in the world to come eternal
   life." This brotherhood of angels must have been an admirable
   compensation for the loss of the fatherhood of that churlish Laban!
   Anything we lose when we leave the world and what is called, "society,"
   is abundantly made up when we can say, "We have come unto the Church of
   the firstborn, whose names are written in Heaven and unto an
   innumerable company of angels."

   Again, the reason why the angels met Jacob at that time was, doubtless,
   because he was surrounded with great cares. He had a large family of
   little children and great flocks and herds and many servants were with
   him. He said, himself, "With my staff I crossed this Jordan and now I
   am become two bands." This was a huge burden of care! It was no light
   thing for one man to have the management of all that mass of life and
   to lead it about in wandering style. But look! There are two companies
   of angels to balance the two companies of feeble ones. If he has two
   bands to take care of, he shall have two bands to take care of him. If
   he has double responsibility, he shall have double assistance.

   So, Brothers and Sisters, when you are in positions of great
   responsibility and you feel the weight pressing upon you, have hope in
   God that you will have double succor and be sure that you pray that
   Mahanaim may be repeated in your experience so that your strength may
   be equal to your day. Again, the Lord's host appeared when Jacob felt a
   great dread. His brother Esau was coming to meet him armed to the teeth
   and, as he feared, thirsty for his blood. In times when our danger is
   greatest, if we are real Believers, we shall be specially under the
   Divine protection and we shall know that it is so. This shall be our
   comfort in the hour of distress. What can Esau do with his 400 men, now
   that the hosts of God have pitched their tents and have assembled in
   their squadrons to watch between us and the foe?

   Can you see the horses of fire and chariots of fire around about the
   chosen servant of God? Jacob ought to have felt calm and quiet in heart
   and I suppose he was when he saw his protectors. Alas, as soon as he
   lost sight of them, poor Jacob was depressed in spirit again about his
   brother, Esau, lest he should slay the mothers with the children! Such
   is the weakness of our hearts! But let us not fall into the grievous
   sin of unbelief. Are we not without excuse if we do so? In times of
   great distress we may expect that the forces of God will become
   recognizable by our faith and we shall have a

   clearer sense of the powers on our side than ever we had before! O Holy
   Spirit, work in us great clearness of spiritual sight!

   And, once again, when you and I, like Jacob, shall be near Jordan, when
   we shall just be passing into the better land, then is the time when we
   may expect to come to Mahanaim. The angels of God and the God of angels
   both come to meet the spirits of the blessed in the solemn article of
   death. Have we not, ourselves, heard of Divine revealings from dying
   lips? Have we not heard the testimony so often, too, that it could not
   have been an invention and a deception? Have not many loved ones given
   us assurance of a glorious revelation which they never saw before? Is
   there not a giving of new sight when the eyes are closing? Yes, O heir
   of Glory, the shining ones shall come to meet you on the river's brink
   and you shall be ushered into the Presence of the Eternal by those
   bright courtiers of Heaven who, on either side, shall be a company of
   dear companions when the darkness is passing and the Glory is streaming
   over you! Be of good cheer! If you see not the hosts of God now, you
   shall see them hereafter when the Jordan shall be reached and you cross
   over to the promised land.

   Thus I have mentioned the time when these invisible forces become
   visible to faith and there is no doubt whatever that they are sent for
   a purpose. Why were they sent to Jacob at this time? Perhaps the
   purpose was first, to revive an ancient memory which had well-near
   slipped from him. I am afraid he had almost forgotten Bethel. Surely it
   must have brought his vow at Bethel to mind, the vow which He made unto
   the Lord when he saw the ladder and the angels of God ascending and
   descending upon it. Here they were! They had left Heaven and come down
   that they might hold communion with him. I like the dream at Bethel
   better than the vision of Mahanaim for this reason, that he saw the
   Covenant God at the top of the ladder--here he only sees the angels.
   Yet there is a choice pearl in this latter sight, for whereas at Bethel
   he only saw angels ascending and descending, he here sees them on the
   earth by his side, ready to protect him from all harm.

   How sweetly do new mercies refresh the memory of former favors and how
   gently does new Grace remind us of old promises and debts. Brother,
   does not your Mahanaim point to some half-forgotten Bethel? Judge for
   yourself. Should our glorious God give you, at this time, a clear view
   of His Divine power and of His Covenant faithfulness, I pray that the
   sight may refresh your memory concerning that happy day when you first
   knew the Lord, when you first gave yourself up to Him and His Grace
   took possession of your spirit. Mahanaim was granted to Jacob, not only
   to refresh his memory, but to lift him out of the ordinary low level of
   his life. Jacob, you know, the father of all the Jews, was great at
   huckstering--it was his very nature to drive bargains. Jacob had all
   his wits about him and rather more than he should have had, well
   answering to his name of "supplanter."

   He would let no one deceive him and he was ready at all times to take
   advantage of those with whom he had any dealings. Here the Lord seems
   to say to him, "O Jacob, My servant, rise out of this miserable way of
   dealing with Me and be of a princely mind." Such should have been the
   lesson of this angelic visit, though it was ill-learned. Jacob was
   prepared to send off to Esau and call him, "My Lord Esau." He was ready
   to cringe and bow and call himself his servant. He went beyond the
   submissiveness which prudence suggests into the abject subjection which
   is born of fear. The vision should have led Jacob to stand upon higher
   ground. With bands of angels as his bodyguard, he had no need to
   persist in his timorous, pettifogging policy.

   He might have walked along with the dignified confidence of his
   grandfather Abraham. There is something better in this life, after all,
   than policy and planning--faith in God is far grander! A coward's
   scheming never becomes the favorite of Heaven. Why should he fear who
   is protected beyond all fear? Esau could not stand against him, for
   Jehovah Sa-baoth, the Lord of Hosts, was on his side! O for Grace to
   live according to our true position and character--not as poor
   dependents upon our own wits or upon the help of man--but as grandly
   independent of things seen because our entire reliance is fixed upon
   the unseen and eternal! Jacob as a mere keeper of sheep has great cause
   to fear his warlike brother, but as the chosen of God and possessor of
   a heavenly guard he may boldly travel on as if no Esau were in
   existence!

   All things are possible with God. Let us, then, play the man. We are
   not dependent on the things that are seen. Man shall not live by bread
   alone, but by every Word that proceeds out of the mouth of God shall
   man live. Cursed is he that trusts in man. Trust in God with all your
   heart. He is your infinite aid. Do right and give up calculations.
   Plunge into the sea of faith! Believe as much in the invisible as in
   the visible and act upon your faith. This seems to me to be God's

   objective in giving to any of His servants a clearer view of the powers
   which are engaged on their behalf. If such a special vision is granted
   to us, let us keep it in memory.

   Jacob called the name of that place Mahanaim. I wish we had some way in
   this western world, in these modern times, of naming places, and
   children, too, more sensibly. We must either borrow some antiquated
   title, as if we were too short of sense to make one for ourselves, or
   else our names are sheer nonsense and mean nothing. Why not choose
   names which should commemorate our mercies? Might not our houses be far
   more full of interest if around us we saw memorials of the happy events
   of our lives? Should we not note down remarkable blessings in our
   diaries to hand down to our children? Should we not tell our sons and
   daughters, "There God helped your father, Son." "Thus and thus the Lord
   comforted your mother, Daughter." "There God was very gracious to our
   family."

   Keep records of your race! Preserve the household memoranda! I think it
   is a great help for a man to know what God did for his father and his
   grandfather, for he hopes that their God will also be his God. Jacob
   took care to make notes, for he again and again named places by the
   facts which there were seen. Jacob named Bethel and Galeed, and Peniel
   and Mahanaim and other places, for he was a great name giver. Nor were
   his names forgotten, for hundreds of years after, good King David came
   to the same spot as Jacob and found it still known as Mahanaim and
   there the servants of God of another kind met him, also!

   This brings me to my second text. Angels did not meet David, but living
   creatures of another nature met him who answered the purpose of David
   quite as well as angels would have done. So just for a few minutes we
   will dwell upon that second event which distinguished Mahanaim. Turn to
   the Second Book of Samuel, the 17th chapter, 27th verse. David came to
   Mahanaim and was met there by many friends. He stood upon the sacred
   spot accompanied by his handful of faithful friends, fugitives like he
   was. There apparently was not an angel about that day, yet secretly
   there were thousands flying around the sorrowing king.

   Who is this that comes? It is not an angel but old Barzillai. Who is
   this? It is Machir of Lodebar. They bring with them honey, corn,
   butter, sheep, great basins by way of baths and cooking utensils and
   earthen vessels to hold their food. And look, there are beds, too, for
   the poor king has not a couch to lie upon. These are not angels, but
   they are doing what angels could not have done, for Gabriel himself
   could hardly have brought a bed or a basin! Who is yonder prominent
   friend? He speaks like a foreigner! He is an Ammonite! What is his
   name? Shobi, the son of Nahash, of Rabbah, of the children of Ammon. I
   have heard of those people--they were enemies were they not--cruel
   enemies to Israel?

   That man, Nahash--you remember his name? This is one of his sons. Yes!
   God can turn enemies into friends when His servants require succor.
   Those that belong to a race that is opposed to Israel can, if God wills
   it, turn to be their helpers! The Lord found an advocate for His Son,
   Jesus, in Pilate's house--the governor's wife suffered many things in a
   dream because of Him. He can find a friend for His servants in their
   persecutor's own family, even us He raised up Oba-diah to hide the
   Prophets and feed them in a cave--the chamberlain to Ahab, himself, was
   the protector of the saints and, with meat from Ahab's table, they were
   fed!

   It strikes me that Shobi the Ammonite came to David because he owed his
   life to him. Rabbah of Ammon had been destroyed, and this man, probably
   the brother of the king, had been spared. This act of mercy he
   remembered and when he found David in trouble, he acted gratefully and
   came down from his highland home with his men and with his substance.
   Many a good man has found gracious help in his time of need from those
   who have received salvation by his means. If we are a blessing to
   others, they will be a blessing to us. If we have brought any to Christ
   and they have found the Savior by our teaching, there is a peculiar tie
   between us and they will be our helpers. Shobi of Rabbah of Ammon will
   be sure to be generous to David, because he will say, "It is by him I
   live. It is through him that I found salvation from

   death."

   If God blesses you in the conversion of any, it may be that He will
   raise them up in your time of need and send them to help--at any rate,
   either by friends visible or invisible, He will cause you to dwell in
   the land and verily you shall be fed. Here comes another person we have
   heard of before, Machir of Lodebar. That is the large farmer who took
   care of Mephibosheth. He seems to have been a truly loyal man who stuck
   to royal families even when their fortunes were adverse. As he had been
   faithful to the house of Saul, so was he to David. We have among us
   Brothers and Sisters who are always friends of God's ministers--they
   love them for their Master's sake and adhere to them when the more
   fickle spirits rush after new comers. Happy are we to have many such
   adherents!

   They helped the preacher's predecessor--they like to talk of the grand
   old man who ruled Israel in the olden times and they are not tired of
   it. And they are the entertainers of the present leader and are equally
   hearty in their help. God fetches up these Brethren at the moment they
   are needed and they appear with loaded hands. Here comes Barzillai, an
   old man of 80 years and, as the historian tells us, "a very great man."
   His enormous wealth was all at the disposal of David and his followers
   and, "he provided the king sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim." This
   old nobleman was certainly as useful to David as the angels were to
   Jacob and he and his co-helpers were truly a part of God's forces.

   The armies of God are varied--He has not one troop alone, but many. Did
   not Elisha's servants see the mountain full of horses of fire and
   chariots of fire? God's hosts are of varied regiments, appearing as
   horse and foot, cherubim and seraphim and holy men and holy women.
   Those who are of the church of God below are as much a part of the host
   of God as the holiest angels above. Godly women who minister unto the
   Lord do what they can and angels can do no more. On this occasion
   Mahanaim well deserved its name because the help that came to David
   from these different persons came in a most noble way, as though it
   came by angels.

   The helpers of David showed their fidelity to him. He was driven out of
   his palace and likely to be dethroned, but they stood by him and proved
   that they meant to stand by him. Their declaration was in effect, "Your
   are we, you son of Jesse and all that we have." Now was the time of his
   need and now he would see that they were not fine weather friends, but
   such as were true in the hour of trial. See their generosity! What a
   mass of goods they brought to sustain David's troops in the day when
   they were hungry and thirsty! I need not give you the details--your
   verses read like a commissariat roll of demands. Every actually
   necessary form of provision is there. How spontaneous was the gift!
   David did not demand--they brought before he asked!

   He had not sent his sergeants around to levy upon the outlying villages
   and farms--there were the good people-- ready-handed with all manner of
   provisions. Their thoughtfulness was great, too, for they seem to have
   thought of everything that was needed and, besides, they said, "The
   people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness." The
   heartiness of it all is most delightful. They brought their
   contributions cheerfully and joyfully, otherwise they would have
   brought only a meager sort and with less variety of gifts. I infer from
   this that if at any time a servant of God is marching onward in his
   Master's work and he needs assistance of any sort, he need not trouble
   about it, but rest in the Lord and help will surely come, if not from
   the angels above, yet from the Church below.

   Will you look at Solomon's Song, the 6th chapter and 13th verse,
   "Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon
   you. What will you see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two
   armies," or Mahanaim, for that is literally how it stands in the
   Hebrew. In the Church of God, then, we see the company of Mahanaim--the
   saints are the angels of God on earth as the angels are His hosts
   above. God will send these upon His errands to comfort and sustain His
   servants in their times of need. Go on, O David, at the bidding of your
   Lord, for His chosen servants here below will count it their delight to
   be your allies and you shall say of them, "this is God's host!"

   And now, to close. While I have shown you God's invisible agents and
   God's visible agents, I want to call to your mind that in either case
   and in both cases the host is the host of God. That is to say, the true
   strength and safety of the Believer is his God. We do not trust in the
   help of angels. We do not trust in the Church of God, nor in 10,000
   Churches of God all put together, if there were such, but in only God
   Himself. Oh, it is grand to hang on the bare arm of God, for there hang
   all the worlds! The eternal arm is never weary, nor shall those who
   rest on it be confused. "Trust in the Lord forever, for in the Lord
   Jehovah there is everlasting strength."

   I said last Thursday night to you that faith was nothing but sanctified
   common sense and I am sure it is so. It is the most common sense thing
   in the world to trust to the trustworthy--the most reasonable thing in
   the world to take into your calculations the greatest power in the
   world and that is God--and to place your confidence in that power. Yes,
   more, since that greatest power comprehends all the other powers--for
   there is no power in angels, or in men, except what God gives them--it
   is wise to place all our reliance upon God alone. The Presence of God
   with Believers is more certain and constant than the presence of angels
   or holy men. God has said it--"Certainly I will be with you." He has
   said again, "I will not leave you, nor forsake you."

   When you are engaged in Christ's service you have a special promise to
   back you up--"Go you into all the world and preach the Gospel to every
   creature; and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the
   world." What are you afraid of, then? Be done with trembling! Let
   feeble hearts be strong. What can stagger us? "God is with us." Was
   there

   ever a grander battle cry than ours--the Lord of Hosts is with us?
   Blessed was John Wesley to live by faith and then to die saying, "The
   best of all is, God is with us." Shrink? Turn your backs in the day of
   battle? Shame upon you! You cannot, if God is with you, for, "if God is
   with us, who can be against us?" Or if they are against us, who can
   stand for an hour? If, then, God is pleased to grant us help by
   secondary causes, as we know He does--for to many of us He sends many
   and many a friend to help in His good work--then we must take care to
   see God in these friends and helpers. When you have no helpers, see all
   helpers in God! When you have many helpers, then you must see God in
   all your helpers. Herein is wisdom. When you have nothing but God, see
   all in God--when you have everything, then see God in everything. Under
   all conditions keep your heart only on the Lord. May the Spirit of God
   teach us all how to do this.

   This tendency to idolatry of ours, how strong it is. If a man bows down
   to worship a piece of wood or stone, we call him an idolater and so he
   is. But if you and I trust in our fellow men instead of God, it is
   idolatry. If we give to them the confidence that belongs to God, we
   worship them instead of God. Remember how Paul said he did not consult
   with flesh and blood? Alas, too many of us are caught in that snare. We
   consult far more with flesh and blood than with the Lord. The worst
   person I ever consult with at all is a person who is always too near
   me. The Lord deliver me from that evil man, myself The Presence of the
   Lord Jesus is the star of our night and the sun of our day! He is the
   cure of care, the strength of service and the solace of sorrow! Heaven
   on earth is for Christ to be with us and Heaven above is to be with
   Christ.

   I can ask nothing better for you, Brothers and Sisters, than that God
   may be with you in a very conspicuous and manifest manner all through
   this day and right onward till days shall end in the Eternal Day. I do
   not ask that you may see angels, still, if it can be, so be it! But
   what is it, after all, to see an angel? Is not the fact of God's
   Presence better than the sight of the best of His creatures? Perhaps
   the Lord favored Jacob with the sight of angels because he was such a
   poor, weak creature as to his faith. Perhaps if Jacob had been perfect
   in his faith, he would not have needed to see angels. He would have
   said, "I need no vision of heavenly spirits, for I see their Lord."
   What are angels? They are only God's pages to run upon His errands--to
   see their Lord is far better!

   The angels of God are not to be compared with the God of angels! If my
   confidence is in God, that He is my Father and that Jesus Christ has
   become the Brother of my soul and that the Holy Spirit dwells in me
   according to His own Word, why need I care, although no vision of the
   supernatural should ever gladden my eyes? Blessed are they that have
   not seen and yet have believed. "We walk by faith, not by sight," and
   in that joyous faith we rest, expecting that in time and to eternity
   the power of God will be with us, either visibly or invisibly, by men
   or by angels! His arm shall be lifted up for us and His right arm shall
   defend us.

   My heart is glad, for I, too, have had my Mahanaim and in this my hour
   of need for the work of the Lord to which He has called me I see the
   windows of Heaven opened above me and I see troops of friends around
   me. For the Girls Orphanage now to be commenced I see Providence
   moving! Two camps are around me, also, and, therefore, do I preach to
   you this day of that which I have seen and known! May the Angel of the
   Covenant be always with you. Amen.

God Glorified By Children's Mouths

   (No. 1545)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 27, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings ha ve You ordained strength
   because of Your enemies, that You might still the enemy and the
   Avenger." Psalm 8.2.

   IN CONNECTION WITH THE CENTENARY OF SUNDAY SCHOOLS

   THIS Psalm sings of the grandeur of God as seen in creation. Who has
   not been impressed with the sight of the starry sky and the moon
   walking in her brightness? Truly, God is great! Who can stand at night
   and gaze upward to yonder distant worlds without saying, "O Lord, our
   Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth! You have set Your
   Glory above the heavens." The Psalm with equal vigor treats of the
   condescension of God which is all the better seen when we have a view
   of His greatness and Glory. It is not for us to stoop--we are so low
   already. We sometimes use the word, condescension, in reference to man,
   but worms were never raised so high above their meaner fellow worms as
   to be capable of real condescension--that belongs to God alone. "When I
   consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the
   stars, which You have ordained, what is man, that You are mindful of
   him? And the son of man, that You

   visit him?"

   Because of this Divine condescension great honor is put upon man by God
   and the Psalm sings of it, telling of the exaltation of man who, in his
   original, was made a little lower than the angels, but by God's
   gentleness has been made great and crowned with glory and honor. Hence
   the inspired poet sings of the Glory of God in man, for he never thinks
   of extolling man. He only means to say that God is glorious on account
   of the great things which He has done in and for such a poor creature
   as man is. So when he has said that man is made to be the viceroy of
   God over this earth and is set over the works of God's hands, he
   concludes, not by praising man, but by reverently singing, "O Lord our
   Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth!"

   Mark right well the greatness of God, stooping to the littleness of man
   and glorifying itself thereby--the stupendous grandeur of the Highest
   bowing down to the lowest and uplifting it into a place hard by itself
   and so getting to itself abundant renown. This morning our subject is
   the power of God displayed in human weakness--strength out of babes'
   mouths--the way He glorifies Himself by using the very least and
   causing them to show forth His praise to the confusion of His
   adversaries. There is a Glory of God to be seen in creation, but in
   redemption there are peculiarly bright manifestations.

   In creation there was no opposition. When God framed this world there
   was no opposing force to fight against Him--"He spoke and it was done."
   Absolute nothingness was no hindrance to the creation. "In the
   beginning" neither chaos or darkness were resisting forces in the
   framing of the world. "Let there be light," said God, and there was
   light. He speaks life and things live! No trace of rebellion is seen.
   It is in the sphere of moral and spiritual things that "the enemy" is
   met with and here is a labor worthy of God--to overthrow this enemy and
   still the evil voice which curses the sons of men. It is in conquering
   the opposition of the powers of evil that God gets to Himself a Glory
   more remarkable than that which He obtains by the greatest feats of
   creative power.

   So our first thought is that THERE IS A CONFLICT. Our text speaks of
   "enemies" and of "the enemy and the Avenger." We know who the enemies
   are. Are they not the seed of the serpent? Are they not the men of this
   world, the children of darkness? The enemies of God are all men who
   have not been renewed in the spirit of their minds--all who have not
   been turned "from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto
   God." God has--alas that we should have to say it!--many enemies and,
   above all, there is the enemy, that leading spirit, the "prince of the
   power of the air,"

   who has dominion over the children of disobedience and over those
   apostate angels whom he seduced into mutiny so that they revolted, with
   him, from beneath the standard of God.

   Satan is the enemy who contends against the cause of the Truth of God
   and love, which is the cause of God. He is spoken of as "the Avenger"
   because he seeks to revenge himself on God. Through his own sin and
   folly he was expelled from Heaven. The "Son of the Morning" became the
   Prince of Darkness by his own willful deed and he wanders up and down
   the universe of God seeking to take revenge upon the just and holy
   Judge for the sentence which He has passed upon him. There always rages
   a tremendous battle between good and evil, between God and this avenger
   and the evil powers associated with him. This battle rages from day to
   day and will never cease till the Lord has put all enemies under the
   feet of His glorious Son who is manifested to destroy the works of the
   devil.

   Victory shall crown the strife between good and evil and the cry shall
   be heard, "Hallelujah, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigns!" This strife
   began--I hesitate to conclude the sentence for the origin of evil is
   not revealed, but the first historic circumstance we know of was the
   revolt of the angels who kept not their first estate. How they fell we
   think we know, but to a large extent our notions are, as a rule, drawn
   rather from poetical imagination than from positive history. But we do
   know that the devil was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in
   the truth (1 John 8:44) and that, "God spared not the angels that
   sinned, but cast them down to Hell" (2 Peter 2:4). Satan carried the
   warfare into this world at the Fall. Finding a happy pair in Eden, he
   assumed a serpent's form and seduced them with a lie, leading them to
   partake of the fruit of which their God had said, "In the day that you
   taste thereof you shall surely die."

   From that moment the conflict has never ceased throughout the whole
   human family and you find everywhere the seed of the serpent in
   conflict with the "Seed of the woman." God leads the armies of the
   right and the true against the spiritual wickedness which maintains the
   throne of wrong and falsehood. The serpent's seed has continued to
   fight against the Lord Jesus and against His chosen ones, using all
   sorts of weapons against them--by lying and slandering, by false
   doctrine, by soft temptations, by cruel persecutions, by death, itself,
   the enemies have sought to destroy the children of the living God! It
   is a battle royal here below, even as it was above, for we read, "There
   was war in Heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon;
   and the dragon fought and his angels and he prevailed not; neither was
   their place found any more in Heaven."

   The day shall come when there shall be no place found for evil upon
   earth. But until then the god of this world seeks to destroy the Lord
   Jesus Christ and all that are in Him and we must wrestle with him until
   we prevail. On God's part, this conflict is mainly carried on by moral
   and spiritual means. He does use other means at times and He will, in
   the end, use all the resources of Nature for the overthrow of His
   adversaries. Remember the song of the Red Sea where God used the great
   deep to destroy His foes? Even now I hear the jubilant voices of the
   maidens as they answer one another saying, "Sing unto the Lord, for He
   has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider has He thrown into
   the sea." For the most part, however, this battle is not with weapons
   of Nature, but with weapons of Grace.

   And as far as we have to do with it, it is never with the confused
   noise of warriors and garments rolled in blood, for "the weapons of our
   warfare are not carnal," though they are "mighty through God to the
   pulling down of strongholds." The warfare of which we speak is the
   battle of good against evil, of right against wrong, of holiness
   against sin-- in a word, of love against hate. And God uses the weapons
   of His Truth, of His Gospel, of the love of man and especially of the
   sweet life and Divine power of the Holy Spirit to bring men to the feet
   of Jesus Christ, "whom He has appointed heir of all things," that He
   might reign over them and "reconcile them unto God, even the Father."

   This strife goes on every day around us and within us and you and I are
   taking one side or the other in it. We are either enemies of God by
   nature, or we are "reconciled to God by the death of His Son." We are
   under the banner of "the Avenger," or else we follow the standard of
   the Redeemer--one of these two. I invite you, at the outset of our
   discourse, to earnestly ask yourselves on whose side you are. "Are you
   for us, or for our adversaries?" Are you for God and for His Christ, or
   are you still at enmity with your Maker, alienated from God by wicked
   works? With this fact we have opened our discourse--there is a
   conflict.

   II. Secondly, in this conflict THE WEAPONS ARE VERY SINGULAR. What are
   those weapons? The text replies, "Out of the mouth of babes and
   sucklings have You ordained strength." Bring here yon sweet babe and
   let us look into its lovely face! See that little mouth--it challenges
   a kiss! And note with joy that God may use that little mouth as His
   conquering weapon against the devil! By men's mouths God's warfare is
   carried on and all mouths that have ever spoken

   for Him were once the mouths of "babes and sucklings." I have seen many
   ancient cannons upon which were molded in bronze the words--"The last
   argument of kings." Yes, but the gracious arguments of the King of
   kings are sent home by a human mouth--these mouths are fashioned and
   framed on purpose to hurl against the enemy the hot shot of the Gospel!

   Of our Lord Jesus, Himself, we read, "He went forth conquering and to
   conquer," and it is written concerning Him, "Out of His mouth goes a
   sharp sword, that with it He should smite the nations." O mouth of a
   little child, it seems strange that out of you should come the great
   strength of God which shall silence His enemies and yet so it shall be!
   "The Lord gave the Word: great was the company of those that published
   it. Kings of armies did flee and she that tarried at home divided the
   spoil." It was the publication of the God-given Word by human tongues
   which won the victory! The tongue is the glory of man's frame and by it
   the Glory of God is exceedingly manifested and His foes are baffled.

   It must greatly anger Satan to think that his craft is not met by
   craft, nor his clever devices by the wisdom of the world, but that God
   uses the foolishness of preaching to overthrow him! When our Lord sent
   out His Apostles, He did not commission them to assemble squadrons of
   soldiers, but He bade a tongue of fire sit on each one of them! He did
   not charge them to establish His religion by the authority of earthly
   princes and seek the endowments of the State for it, but He gave them
   the endowment of the Holy Spirit and the power to speak His Gospel! In
   them was fulfilled the promise made to Ezekiel, "I will give you the
   opening of the mouth in the midst of them and they shall know that I am
   the

   Lord."--

   "What gifts, what miracles He gave!

   And power to kill and power to save!

   Furnished their tongues with wondrous words,

   Instead of shields and spears and swords.

   Thus armed, He sent the champions forth,

   From east to west, from south to north--

   'Go and assert your Sa vior's cause;

   Go, spread the mystery of His Cross."' Already the testimony of feeble
   men has been used as the great power of God to subdue the nations to
   Himself. Satan's kingdom has been shaken and the empire of Jesus
   extended by the gracious words which have proceeded out of human
   mouths--mouths which once were those of sucklings. See there, fiend of
   Hell, the armory of God? Do you see, in yonder infant class, the
   weapons which the Lord is preparing against you? The child that sucks
   at its mother's breast is born to smite you with the Word of God and,
   before long, when the Spirit of God shall rest upon him, he shall
   batter down your high places with his proclamation of the Gospel! O
   smiter of the human race, the youngest, weakest, feeblest of the sons
   of Adam shall yet tread you under foot! God shall make use of
   children's mouths to vanquish and silence the enemy and the Avenger.

   How are these amazing weapons used? These strangely soft, yet sharp,
   feeble, yet mighty weapons--how are they used? They smite the enemy by
   prayer. Children pray while they are children and, blessed be God,
   their little pleas are heard in Heaven. I like to remember the words of
   Luther when things were going very badly. He went into a room and found
   a number of children in prayer and he exclaimed, "It is well, for the
   children are praying for us: God will be sure to hear them." And so He
   will, Brothers and Sisters. He will not let the cries of Samuels and
   Timothies remain unheard. Thus, from the heavenward side, the prayers
   uttered by children's mouths will bring prosperity to the great cause.

   As these children grow older it is by their mouths that they shall
   bombard and batter the power of the enemy from the ramparts of prayer
   and so shall bring an overthrow upon evil and error and God's Word
   shall be triumphant. O blessed power of prayer, nothing can stand
   against you! The man, the child, the babe who knows but how to pray
   shall certainly prevail with God and "still the enemy and the
   Avenger."--

   "Prayer is the simplest form of speech That infant lips can try,"

   and yet it is one of the most effectual forms of assault against the
   powers of darkness. These little mouths, too, shall be used for praise
   and that is another powerful blow against the Avenger. For whenever we
   praise God we cast down the pride of the great enemy. Praise glorifies
   God and that is what Satan cannot bear. In proportion as God is
   glorified, he feels himself degraded and, therefore, it is a blessed
   thing to magnify the Lord. Little children, when they are rightly

   taught, praise the Messiah early and, as they grow up with deeper
   voices and fuller volume of sound, but perhaps not, even then, with
   truer hearts, they praise and bless the God of their fathers. The
   mouths of babes and sucklings are used by God to lower the pride of His
   adversaries, while they cry, "Hosanna!" and sing the praise of Jesus'
   name.

   Nor is this all, for out of man's mouth God sends forth testimony by
   His Holy Spirit and this is the sharpest blow of all. The enemy dreads
   nothing so much as witness-bearing to the Gospel, for he knows that it
   pleases God, "by the foolishness of preaching to save them that
   believe." Under the head of testimony I would include all sorts of
   speech concerning our Lord Jesus and the Gospel of our salvation,
   whether it proceeds from the mouths of men, women, or children. The
   testimony of Jesus is strength, however feeble may be the voice which
   utters it. Whoever publishes the salvation of Jesus Christ is, with his
   mouth, smiting the enemy! When they that fear the Lord speak often, one
   to another, about the Glory of God--when they tell again and again,
   "the old, old story, of Jesus and His love"--then is God, out of human
   mouths, stilling the enemy and the Avenger!

   How sweet to think, dear Brothers and Sisters, that we never know what
   one child's mouth can do! One would like to have seen little George
   Whitefield when first he began to prattle. Who would have thought that
   the mouth of such a youngster would ultimately set two nations on fire
   by its zealous declaration of the Truth of God? I should like to have
   seen John Wesley, when he was a little child, on the knee of that
   remarkable woman, "the mother of the Wesleys!" Who would have thought
   that he would awaken the masses as he did? Out of the mouths of little
   George Whitefield and little John Wesley--out of those two babes'
   mouths--how grandly did the Lord smite the adversary!

   Aha! Aha! O Satan! To be overcome by behemoth or leviathan might make
   you angry! But to be smitten out of infants' mouths causes you to bite
   the dust in utter dishonor! You are sorely broken, now that, "out of
   the mouth of babes and sucklings" you are put to shame! Mouths that
   pray and praise and publish salvation are the Lord's pieces of ordnance
   with which He defeats His adversaries in the great battle of salvation.
   His Son is the Word, but these mouths supply the voices by which the
   Word is sounded forth in the ears of men! Jesus is not made known
   except through His people--they are His heralds, who cry, "Behold the
   Lamb." This agency is "mighty through God" and so it was ordained to
   be, for it is according to the Divine ordinance that out of the mouth
   of babes and sucklings strength should come.

   The Word of God, though it is spoken by the feeblest mouth, is
   essential strength, a thing of majesty and might. The Hebrew has it,
   "Have You found strength," as if the very foundation of the strength of
   the Church lay, under God, in the mouths that God moves to speak. The
   preaching of the Gospel is at the bottom of the battle axe and weapons
   of everything--holy teachings are war of the Gospel campaign. The
   Septuagint, as quoted by our Lord, translates it--"Out of the mouths of
   babes and sucklings have You perfected praise." From children's mouths
   there will come the highest form of adoration. Praise perfected, which
   goes up before the Lord, does not come from cherubim and seraphim, but
   from human lips which once were those of infancy! Lips that press the
   mother's breast are the instruments of music which yet shall be attuned
   to the sweetest of Heaven's own songs! Glory be to His name for this!
   Let us bless Him that He graciously chooses such poor creatures to be
   the noblest of His choristers above.

   III. Having dwelt long enough upon this point, let us notice, in the
   third place, that THE WARRIORS IN THIS WARFARE ARE VERY SPECIAL. The
   weapons are amazing and the warriors, themselves, are remarkable, for
   the text says that God perfects His praise out of the mouths of babes
   and sucklings. We may read this spiritually with the guarantee of
   Scripture for, first, such as are like babes in spirit are God's
   chosen. Their character cannot be better described than by calling
   them, "newborn babes who desire the unadulterated milk of the Word of
   God." Hear, dear Brothers and Sisters, your Master's own words as He
   speaks in the 11th chapter of the Gospel according to Matthew--"At that
   time Jesus answered and said, I thank You, O Father, Lord of Heaven and
   earth, because you have hid these things from the wise and prudent and
   have revealed them unto babes."

   Childlike men and women, simple-hearted, honest, trustful, loving
   spirits are the chosen of God. Those who are so very wise and know such
   a great deal that they feel bound to quibble, pick holes and raise idle
   questions--these are not God's elect. He does not choose the wise, but
   the foolish things--those who do not know, nor pretend to know, but
   take their instruction from the Divine Teacher. As to mere knowledge
   which puffs up so many, there are some things which Believers do not
   wish to know. There are some difficulties which they do not desire
   removed--they are glad to have ample room and space enough for
   faith--and though this causes wise people to despise them, they care
   little for that, since their names are written in Heaven--and it is out
   of their mouths, weaklings as they are, that God has ordained strength!

   No, more than this, not only are such the Lord's chosen, but such are
   His witnesses. I want to call attention to that, because in that 25th
   verse of the 11th chapter of Matthew our Lord was speaking to His
   Apostles. He had been sending them out to preach and the Evangelist
   records, "All that time Jesus answered and said." That is to say, at
   the very time when He sent out these special servants of His who were,
   in the judgment of scribes and Pharisees, nothing better than poor
   babes, He thanked God because they were of a kind which He delights to
   use! He thanked God that He had not committed the Gospel Revelation to
   the wise and to the noble, but unto these child-like ones who had
   guileless minds and capacity for believing and nothing more.

   These poor men could do little else but speak when they were spoken to
   and say what they were told--and that is the best qualification for a
   minister that I know of--for him to speak only when God speaks to him
   and then utter what God has said to him and nothing more. The Father
   chooses just such. See how Paul states this fact in the opening chapter
   of his first Epistle to the Corinthians--"For you see your calling,
   brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty,
   not many noble, are called: but God has chosen the foolish things of
   the world to put to shame the wise; and God has chosen the weak things
   of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty; and base
   things of the world and things which are despised, has God chosen, yes
   and things which are not, to bring to nothing things that are: that no
   flesh should glory in His Presence." See what strange champions God has
   ordained for His battle--the very weakest among men, babes and
   sucklings in their own esteem. These who are weakness, itself, are to
   go forth and contend

   for the Truth of God!

   Such, my Brothers and Sisters, are those who proclaim the triumphs of
   Christ in the world. Our Lord would get little honor from our race if
   all children's voices were hushed and all child-like spirits with them.
   Scribes and Pharisees never cry, "Hosanna!" they are so busy binding on
   their phylacteries, washing their hands and devouring widows' houses.
   The first to cry, "Hosanna!" are the children and the next are those
   who are like they. Some say, "To shout and sing is children's work." So
   it is and it is ours because we are children, too! May God make us to
   grow in Grace till we are as little children and are, therefore, ready
   and eager to praise our great Father!

   Those who are reputed to be wise men do not praise too much--they go
   upon the noncommittal principle and prefer criticism to gratitude. They
   are always criticizing the weather--if it is good for the turnips it is
   bad for the wheat--and if dry for hay-making, it is too dry for
   something else. The worldly-wise man never says, "Blessed be God for
   this delightful season; nothing can be better; we are highly favored."
   No, he thinks he shows his wisdom by finding fault! God Himself cannot
   escape from his sage remarks. But if a man is not wise enough to be
   forever grumbling and is so foolish as to be happy, so foolish as to
   believe the Truth of God, so foolish as to trust in the most
   trustworthy of all beings, namely, his God--he is also the sort of man
   that praises God and from such hearts God gets His chief praises.

   Our Lord Jesus Christ is coming again, not to ride upon an ass, or upon
   a colt, the foal of an ass, but to reign in Glory! And when He comes,
   the first to meet Him and salute Him will be those poor, babe-like ones
   who did not boast of culture, but believed in God; who knew little, but
   yet knew their Lord and longed for His appearing, sighing often, "Oh
   that He would come and end the strife! Even so, come, Lord Jesus!"
   These are they who find Him first, as the shepherds found Him at
   Bethlehem when the wise men rambled round by Jerusalem. And these are
   they who joy and rejoice over Him while scribes and Pharisees quarrel
   about Him. The poor have the Gospel preached to them and the babes in
   spirit hear that Gospel and live!

   Thus have I spoken to you concerning the warriors God has chosen. They
   are simple people, trustful people, unaffected people--made so by
   Divine Grace--converted into little children. They are ready to believe
   their God. They are not wise, or noble, or anything great in their own
   esteem and yet out of their mouths God has ordained strength and by
   their witness He silences the disputers of this world and all the
   wisdom of men.

   IV. Now let us note, in the fourth place, that THE QUALIFICATION OF
   THESE WARRIORS LIES IN THEIR WEAK SIDE. If it lay on the strong side,
   the text would have been written in another manner and we should have
   read, "Out of the mouth of men of middle age, in the prime of life--out
   of the mouth of wise old men who have gray hairs upon their head,
   indicative of their long experience--out of their mouths God has
   ordained strength." But He takes men at their weakest and speaks of
   "babes," or children who are quite young. The word must not be confined
   to infants, for it includes young children who are able to run about
   the streets.

   The sucklings, also, are older children than they would represent with
   us, for eastern mothers often nurse their children till they are three
   years of age, so that some sucklings speak distinctly. The idea is that
   if you take man at his least, out of his mouth God ordains strength. He
   regards not man as grown up and strong, but man in his greatest
   weakness and out of the mouth of weak man God ordains strength. What
   does this teach? I take it that whatever is weakest about man is that
   in which the Grace of God glorifies itself most. Man is not only a soul
   and spirit, but he is, in part, material and, therefore, a poor
   creature composed in part of the lower elements. He is not a pure
   spirit, like an angel, but linked on to mother earth by a cumbrous and
   hampering body of clay.

   He is a worm and yet an angel--half-way between dust and Deity--brother
   to the worm and to corruption and yet immortal! Satan is, no doubt,
   filled with scorn of man when he looks at him and measures him with
   himself. "Is this the creature that is to be set over all the works of
   God's hands--made of earth and water, phosphates and metals? I am far
   nobler than he! Can I not flash like lightning, while he must creep
   about the world to find himself a grave?" Yes, but herein is the Glory
   of God's conflict and victory. The Lord intends to overcome the Prince
   of Evil by a poor creature like man, who is but of yesterday and is
   crushed before the moth! It is glorious, to my mind, that the Lord
   should deign to embody His power in weak creatures as we are and in
   that way make Satan see that the right and the true in the feeblest
   being is unconquerable and that in this form God carries the war into
   his own territory and defeats him.

   Thus the Lord puts the adversary to a perpetual reproach. He pits a
   child against His giant foe and overcomes him. He hurls defiance to
   Satan out of a babe's mouth! Go your way, O enemy! You are dishonored
   by the victory which feebleness gains over you. God is glorified in
   man's grievous infirmity. Man is, at his best, of all creatures one of
   the feeblest and there is not so very much difference between
   full-grown men and babes. A few years ago we could not help ourselves
   at all, for we were abjectly weak in our infancy. But are we much
   better now? How did you feel yesterday afternoon in the storm, when the
   thunder rolled overhead and the lightning flashed and flamed across the
   sky? Did you not feel that you were helpless as a babe?

   Put out to sea in a storm and you will soon learn your babyhood, I
   guarantee you, and feel that when "rocked in the cradle of the deep"
   you are as powerless as a child in its mother's arms! We need not be
   ashamed of this, but glory in it because the power of God rests upon
   us! The great God seems to say to Satan, "It is by these poor feeble
   things that I will anger you, O haughty prince of the air! By such
   beings as these I will overthrow your usurped dominion! Though they
   suffer, though they are tempted, yet by My Grace they shall triumph
   over you." We have the power to suffer and herein lies a great part of
   our qualification to do the Lord's service before His enemies. It is
   our Redeemer's qualification. He could not save us until He suffered!
   He could not redeem us until He died! Not His strength, but His
   weakness saved us, for He was crucified in weakness and by that
   Crucifixion He redeemed our souls!

   Think of the men and women who have glorified God on beds of sickness,
   bearing their pains with patience and blessing God all the while. Think
   of the many on the rack and at the stake who have there extolled the
   Lord their God! Of all the music God ever heard, there is none that can
   equal in intense sweetness the cries of His dear, suffering, martyred
   people when every limb has been tormented by the persecutor and yet
   every particle of their body and every power of their soul had
   willingly yielded up itself to maintain His cause and glorify His name!
   True music lies not in the sound, but in the spirit of the song and,
   therefore, I say none can match, much less excel, the songs of the host
   of martyrs! Blessed be God that we can suffer! We should be denied a
   privilege if we had not been able to endure the will of God as well as
   to do it. Surely of all diadems, that crown which is set with rubies,
   the crown which adorns the martyr's brow, is the most resplendent!

   Yes, it is man's weak side, his suffering and his dying side, by which
   God has shown the enemy that men can love their God even unto death,
   that virtue can triumph over all selfishness, that true hearts can make
   sacrifices, that mortal man can defy temptation and can, through God's
   Grace, follow after that which is good to the uttermost of loss and
   pain. Now, dear Brothers and Sisters, dwell on this thought and
   meditate on the fact that our power to serve God lies on our weak side.
   He uses not our greatness, but our littleness. You know what the
   learned men say is the weak part of some of us--they put it something
   like this--"We regret the preacher's total inability to keep abreast of
   the times. He has no capacity for modern thought and his lack of
   affection for the higher culture which is so much the characteristic of
   this marvelously enlightened century." That is our weakness! Yes, and
   our strength and, therefore, we glory in it!

   "I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and Him
   crucified." If all God's servants will come to this, they will secure
   far more success than by the pretentious style of so-called "culture,"
   which is nothing but the science of growing more weeds than usual. That
   which is new in theology is not true! The Gospel was of full stature at
   its very birth! No man can add to it or take from it. It cannot be
   improved and it only needs to be told out in the power of the Holy
   Spirit and it will perform wonders even as of old. Our infirmity we
   will glory in, for we have this treasure in earthen vessels and if the
   vessel had not been of earth, we might never have received the
   treasure. "But," cries one, "surely we need wisdom to guide us!" I
   answer, "Jesus Christ is made unto us Wisdom," and we have but to learn
   of Him.

   We hear much, nowadays, of "great thinkers," but we prefer to be great
   believers! Deep thinking is a very shallow affair, after all, when the
   thoughts are our own. We only get into real depths when we receive the
   thoughts of God. So far as I can see, these "thinkers" generally empty
   their places of worship when they preach and the poor souls that most
   need comfort get none whatever. Rather than copy their example, we may
   well prefer to sing with Paul, "When I am weak then am I strong." We
   will believe what God says and take it as a matter of fact, just as a
   child does. And oh, what a sweet thing a child's faith is! Many a time
   when a dear little girl has come to join the Church and looked at me
   with her expressive, believing eyes which seemed to see Jesus, I have
   admired and envied her pure, unquestioning confidence.

   Knowing nothing about those horrible doubts which are now sown like
   thistles everywhere, such as these have the rest of faith without its
   struggles! I have desired to be a little child again and wished that I
   had never heard of the existence of a quibbler. Those fine books of the
   broad school which came from Germany years ago, but which we now
   produce at home--it is a pity to have seen the binding of them. Even
   doctors of divinity favor us with denials of plenary inspiration and
   aid in that form of undermining work--they may have all their books so
   long as we can keep our Bibles and God gives us firm faith in Himself.

   Let us but know Jesus and lean our heads on His bosom and the learned
   men may speculate as they please. Oh, when the Church gets back to her
   simple faith in Jesus she shall be qualified for victory! She shall
   vanquish the world when she has thrown away her wooden sword of carnal
   reason and has taken up the true Jerusalem blade of faith in God! Then
   out of the mouths of babes and sucklings God will do what He never will
   do out of the mouths of Scribes and Pharisees and wise men. Out of the
   mouths of weak people, who believe what God tells them--the mouths of
   weak people who have no capacity except the capacity of faith--out of
   these will God perfect praise and glorify Himself!

   V. That leads me, in finishing, to plead for a loving reverence for
   childhood. If the Lord uses the weak side of man and if He is engaged
   to win His ultimate victory over the devil by feeble man at his
   feeblest, then God bless the children! It seems to me that in the
   Lord's battle there is always a babe in the fore-front. The armies of
   olden times placed a huge champion in their van, like Goliath of Gath.
   But it is not so in God's army--there a babe leads the way! Pharaoh
   oppresses Israel and crushes the people down till their cry goes up
   because of their sore bondage. God is going to deliver them. How does
   the work begin? Here is the opening of the campaign--"And the daughter
   of Pharaoh went down to the river to wash herself."

   And there she spied a little ark made of bulrushes which she sent her
   maid to fetch and there was a Hebrew child within it. "And behold! The
   babe wept." Thus was the champion of Israel introduced upon the scene!
   The goodly child whom his parents, in faith, had hidden was he by whom
   God would break Rahab in pieces! The still loftier story of the battle
   of the Lamb opens in like manner--"Unto us a Child is born, unto us a
   Son is given." "She brought forth her first-born son and wrapped Him in
   swaddling cloths and laid Him in a manger." That was the signal for the
   heat of the conflict--that Babe led the way! The Holy Child Jesus is at
   the head of all our marches! One may well honor infancy and childhood
   since this is the case!

   Let our subject prevent our entertaining doubts about the possibility
   of children's conversions--that would be insanity and almost blasphemy!
   Do you not know that unless you are converted and become as little
   children you shall not enter the kingdom of Heaven? Jesus said, "Suffer
   the little children to come unto Me and forbid them not, for of such is
   the kingdom of Heaven." The childlike spirit is no disqualification--in
   some respects it is a vantage ground. Christianity is the religion of
   children! Other religions, as a rule, aim at older folk and pretend to
   mystery. Other religions are not worth understanding, but yet they
   affect depth and secrecy--you must be initiated and pass through years
   of study before you can hope to derive any advantage from them. But the
   religion of Jesus Christ was meant for the poor and for the

   lowly. All that which is necessary for the saving of the soul can be
   speedily learned and understood, the Holy Spirit being the teacher.

   As far as the practical, saving part of Christianity is concerned, it
   is the religion of children. If a preacher can interest a child, he can
   interest anybody. Is it not all a mistake when we say, "Oh, he is only
   fit to talk to children"? If he is fit to do this, he is fit to talk to
   Apostles! Let us heartily believe, also, in children's praises. I am
   sure you must do so if you are like your Lord, for He delighted in
   them. He would not stop the boys when they shouted, "Hosanna!" The
   scribes sneer-ingly asked, "Do You hear what these say?" Yes, He did
   hear it, and He said, "Out of their mouths God has perfected praise."
   Let the children sing and do not despise their hymns because they are
   more fit for children than for you. Let the children sing and thank God
   they sing. Never despise them. Do not say, "Oh, they are only a parcel
   of boys and girls." What if they are? May they not be a better parcel
   than some of you? If we were half as free from guile and unbelief as
   boys and girls, it would be better for us! If we could get the simple
   trustfulness of childhood back, again, it would be a great gain to
   character. Let us not undervalue their praises or their service.

   My text supports me in the strongest appeal which I can make. Hear it
   yet again--"Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings have You ordained
   strength." Let the children serve God and let us put forms of service
   in their way. That is a sweet verse--"And Samuel ministered before the
   Lord, being a child, girded with a linen ephod." The child Samuel and
   the Lord Jehovah! What an amazing combination! God who fills all things
   and Hannah's little boy! God give us to see our boys and girls
   ministering before the Lord while they are yet in their frocks and
   pinafores! The linen ephod is as suitable for a child as for an ancient
   priest. No robe is more glorious than the garment of service and
   whether it is worn by old or young, it is a right royal dress.

   Last of all, let us expect victory to come to the Church through little
   children. It may happen that God will bring the world to Christ's feet
   by the children. It is written, "A little child shall lead them." Who
   knows how many are led to Jesus by children? This city of ours is
   better evangelized by our Sunday schools than by all the rest of us put
   together! I don't mean to flatter Sunday school teachers, but I must
   speak well of the children. When they go home they find that father is
   hardly dressed. He has not been to a place of worship, but he has been
   reading the Sunday paper. He does not need any of your singing and
   preaching. Little Mary and Tommy come back and they don't ask him
   anything about it, but they begin to sing. And when they have their
   dinner they talk about what teacher said and, perhaps, they say
   something about the sermon and so Father gets more singing and
   preaching than he bargained for.

   When they go to bed they clasp their little hands and pray for their
   father and he is obliged to hear them. Thus he gets praying as well as
   singing. The children are missionaries and they enter where others
   cannot. The city missionary may be shut out, but Father cannot shut out
   Tommy or Mary and they must be allowed to sing or they will cry and
   that is worse--so that their witness cannot be silenced! What little
   children are doing for London and for our great cities is impossible
   for us to calculate! The darlings die and in this they often do more
   than by their lives. How many hard hearts have been broken and stubborn
   wills subdued by the deathbeds of infants? How many a mother has had
   her first desires for Heaven kindled by the flight of her little cherub
   up to the bosom of Christ?

   They do God's work here below in a wonderful manner. It is true and
   will be truer every day, that out of the mouth of babes and sucklings
   the Lord has ordained strength, because of His enemies, that He might
   still the enemy and the Avenger. God's blessing be with all of you who
   work among the children. Amen.

Men Bewitched

   (No. 1546)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you should not obey
   the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth,
   crucified among you?" Galatians 3:1.

   WITH very great enthusiasm the Galatians received the Gospel when Paul
   preached it to them. They seem to have been a very warm-hearted but
   fickle people and Paul found to his great grief that while he was away
   from them, certain false teachers came in and turned them aside from
   the Gospel which he had delivered to them. He spoke out very plainly
   about the matter. In this verse he uses very strong terms, while he
   says to them--"O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you
   should not obey the truth?" I do not know that any such witchery has
   fallen upon any of you, but I do know that, being men, we are all
   subject to the same dangers and I know, also, that there is a witchery
   in the very air at this time so that many are to be found throughout
   the Churches of this land to whom these words might be justly spoken.

   We can only hope to escape this evil which Paul so severely condemns by
   the use of right cautionary means. It is only, in fact, as the Holy
   Spirit shall keep us that we shall be preserved from the fascinations
   of error and kept true to the grand old Gospel of the blessed God. At
   this time I shall very briefly speak, in the first place, upon the
   subtle danger which is hinted at here--"Who has bewitched you?"
   Secondly, at more length I shall speak upon the blessed
   preservative--there is no way of being kept from this witchery like
   having Christ Jesus, evidently crucified, set forth among us. And,
   thirdly, a few words, in closing, upon the supreme folly of any who,
   having tried this Divine preservative, nevertheless become bewitched by
   error.

   I. First, then, let us think of THE SUBTLE DANGER which is always
   around us. It was hard work to preach the Gospel, at first, among the
   heathen. Men had to lay down their lives to do it. They had to propound
   new things which the heathen mind did not readily receive. But, by the
   power of the Spirit of God, converts were made and Churches were
   formed. And now came another difficulty. Even those that were
   converted, or appeared to be so, became suddenly, as it were, bewitched
   with error of one kind or another, just as in families children are
   suddenly taken ill with certain complaints which seem incidental to
   childhood. If parents had never heard of such things before, they would
   be astonished! They would suppose that they must lose their children
   when such unaccountable diseases suddenly appeared in them and yet they
   survive.

   In the family of Christ certain epidemics break out at times. We cannot
   tell why they come when they do and, at first, perhaps, we are puzzled
   and perplexed to think that such diseases should come at all. But they
   do come and, therefore, it is well to be on our guard against them.
   Paul calls it being bewitched because these people fell into strange
   error--error which had no argument to back it--error surprising and
   startling. He seems to say, "I cannot make it out. I cannot understand
   how you should be thus misled." In Paul's day the error was generally
   that of Judaism. They wanted to go back to circumcision and to the old
   sacrifices of the Law. Paul was indignant enough about this. "I
   testify," he said, "to everyone of you, that if he is circumcised, he
   is a debtor to keep the whole Law and he has fallen from Grace. If you
   go back to the old beggarly elements of Judaism, you are leaving Christ
   and rejecting Christ and imperiling your souls."

   He declares that he could not understand how they should wish to do it.
   He calls it witchery, for in his day it was believed that men could
   cast an evil spell upon one another and thus work evil upon their
   fellow men. It seemed to Paul to be something like that--as if the
   devil, himself, were in it and came and turned men away from Christ
   Jesus to go back to trusting in the Law and its obsolete ceremonies.
   And it was not long before Paul found another kind of error in the
   Church. There came in among the most humble Believers certain men of
   education who thought themselves highly intelligent--men who knew
   something about Socrates and Plato--and they said, "These doctrines are
   too plain. The poor

   people understand them and they come into the Church, but no doubt they
   have a deeper meaning intended only for the initiated."

   So they began to spiritualize everything and, in the process, they
   spirited away the very Gospel itself! Paul could not endure it. He said
   that though he or an angel from Heaven should preach any other Gospel
   than that which he had preached, it would be a cursed deed! Whether it
   were Judaism, or Gnosticism, he smote it heavily and said to those who
   fell into it, "Who has bewitched you?" You who read Church history know
   that in later ages the Church fell into Arian-ism. There were great
   disputes about the Deity of Christ and the air, for a long time, was
   full of that deadly plague. When that battle was over and such men as
   Athanasius had settled the question of our Redeemer's Godhead, then
   came up all the superstitions of Rome--that awful midnight, black with
   murky clouds, which covered the Church for ages.

   Indeed, if we look back on history, it seems like a witchcraft, that
   men who had the Gospel preached among them in all its glorious
   simplicity, should, after all, submit their minds to such debasing
   falsehoods as those of old Rome. They prostrated themselves before
   images of wood and stone after the heathen manner, even as their pagan
   forefathers did! At this present time it is a marvel to some of us how
   the Churches have been bewitched again. When I was a boy, I recollect
   hearing Mr. Jay say, "Puseyism is a lie!" I remember the words coming
   just like that from his reverend lips and everybody, or nearly
   everybody, fought with him. It was an amazing event if a high Church or
   ritualistic place was set up. Everybody was astonished at it and, if
   you said, "This is the Church of England and this is according to her
   Prayer-Book," everybody said you were uncharitable and that it was not
   so. They pitied our fears and said that a dozen men were going towards
   Rome and that was all.

   Look now, Sirs--these things are openly done! Our parish Churches are
   commonly turned into mass houses and the Church of England is slightly
   to be distinguished, in many parishes, from the Church of Rome! And yet
   nobody is astonished! And, if we make a remark about it, we are set
   down as bigoted. Who has bewitched this Protestant land? With
   Smithfield scarcely yet swept of the ashes of her martyrs, they set up
   the crucifix again! What would Oliver Cromwell say if he and his
   Ironsides could come back to see what they are making of this land? I
   know some strong things he would say and, as I cannot speak such
   vigorous words as he would have uttered, I leave the subject with words
   borrowed from Paul which well suit the case--"O foolish Englishmen, who
   has bewitched you, that you should thus turn aside?"

   Nor is this all. You see this witchery in another way among our
   dissenting Churches. At a time not yet forgotten Unitarianism and
   Socinianism gradually crept into Non-conforming congregations and the
   pulpits lost their testimony for Christ. The Meeting Houses were
   deserted and true religion seemed dying out of the land. Then came
   Whitefield and Wesley and all their troop of Methodists and the blessed
   flame that was almost quenched burned up again and we, of this
   generation, have said one to another, "That experiment will never be
   repeated--the Non-conformist Churches will never go in that direction
   again--they know better! They see the ill-effect of this modern
   teaching and they will now stick to the grand old Gospel."

   So I dreamed! But I dream in that way no longer, for scarcely do I look
   anywhere but I find the Gospel of Christ diluted, the milk of the Word
   adulterated and the grand Gospel, as Luther and Calvin would have
   thundered it out, seldom enough to be heard! O foolish Non-conformists,
   who has bewitched you that you should not obey the Truth of God, but
   should seek after this novelty and the other--this refinement and the
   other--and let your God and Savior go? As for us, if we stand alone,
   God forbid that we should glory save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus
   Christ! This is the peril.

   II. Our second head is THE ONLY PRESERVATIVE. The Apostle says that the
   Galatians had had Christ set forth before their eyes crucified among
   them. Well then, if you want to be kept right and sound in the faith,
   the first thing is to get the right Subject fixed in the center of your
   hearts--Jesus Christ Crucified! Paul says that he preached that. He set
   Jesus forth. Whatever else he might not have made clear, he did set
   forth the Person and work of Jesus Christ. Beloved, settle this in your
   soul, that your only hope and the main Subject of your meditation shall
   always be Jesus Christ! Whatever I do not know, O my Lord, help me to
   know You! Whatever I do not believe, enable me to believe You and to
   trust You and to take Your every Word as the very Truth of God which it
   is!

   Beloved, away with the religion that has little of Christ in it. Christ
   must be Alpha and Omega, First and Last. The religion that is made up
   of our works and our feelings and our willings is a lie! Our religion
   must have Christ for the Foundation, Christ as the Cornerstone, Christ
   as the Top Stone! And if we are not based and bottomed, grounded and
   settled upon Him, our religion is in vain. Paul wonders that any to
   whom Christ has been the chief thing should ever

   have been bewitched and I think that if Christ is really such to your
   souls, you will not turn aside through error, but Christ Crucified will
   hold you fast.

   But Paul says not only that he had preached Christ to them, but that he
   had set Him forth, by which I understand that he had taken pains to
   make everything about Christ clear to them. He had preached His Person
   as Man and God. He had preached His work as the atoning Sacrifice. He
   had preached Him as risen and pleading before the Throne of God. He had
   preached Him as our Substitute. He had made this the main
   doctrine--that if we are saved, we are saved by the Righteousness of
   Christ and our sin is put away because Christ bore it in our place and
   suffered the penalty due for it that the Justice of God might be
   satisfied and we might be saved. That is what He means by Christ
   Crucified.

   He had gone into details on this point and set forth the glorious
   doctrines which cluster about the Cross. Brothers and Sisters, if you
   want to be kept from the modern witcheries, think much of Christ and go
   into detail about Him. Be familiar with His Divine Person. Be well
   acquainted with His relationships and His offices--know what He is in
   the Covenant of Grace, what He is to the Father, what He is to you! Oh
   seek to know Him! He yet surpasses knowledge, but be students of
   Christ! Do not have a mere superficial knowledge of Him, but seek to
   know Christ and to be found in Him. This will keep you free from error.

   When the Apostle says that He set Christ forth, he means, next, that he
   had done it with great plainness. The Greek word has to do with a
   program or a proclamation. It is as good as to say, "I have set Christ
   before you as plainly as if I had printed a great bill and stuck it up
   before your eyes. I have put the letters down in capitals, as a King,
   when he makes a proclamation, puts it on the walls and calls attention
   to it. So," says Paul, "I have set forth Christ before you. I have not
   talked of Him in a mystical way, so that you did not know what I meant,
   but I have set Him forth. I have said of Him that He suffered in our
   place and was made a curse for us, as it is written, 'Cursed is
   everyone that hangs on a tree.'" Paul set forth Jesus plainly.

   Now, you know the way in which Jesus Christ is preached by some. It was
   well described by old Dr. Duncan when he said, "They preach that the
   death of Christ, in some way or other, had some sort of connection, in
   some way or other, with the salvation of men." Yes, that is it--misty,
   cloudy, foggy--a bottle of smoke! We do not preach Christ in that way,
   but we just say this, "The Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us
   all." And because He was oppressed and He was afflicted in our place,
   therefore does God most freely remit the sin of Believers and bid them
   go their way. Substitution--may we never stammer over that--Christ in
   the sinner's place!

   Beloved, if you will get a hold of that Truth and get it well worked
   into your soul, you will be more than a match for the ritualism or
   rationalism of this age. Give up that doctrine? The man who has once
   drunk it in and knows its sweetness cannot give it up, for he gets to
   feel that, having once believed it, it acts in him as a detector by
   which he discovers what is false doctrine and it gives him a taste
   which makes false doctrine loathsome to him so that he cries, "Away
   with it!" If anything contrary to this comes before him, he does not
   timidly say, "Everybody has a right to his opinion." No! He says, "Yes,
   they may have a right to their opinion and so have I to mine and my
   opinion is that any opinion which takes away from the glory of Christ's
   substitutionary Sacrifice is a detestable opinion." Get the real
   Atonement of Christ thoroughly into your soul and you will not be
   bewitched!

   Nor is this all. Paul says that Christ was set forth crucified visibly
   among them. Did you ever see Christ in this way? I do not ask whether
   you ever saw a vision. Who wishes for that? I do not ask whether your
   imagination was so worked upon that you thought you saw the Savior.
   There would be no particular use in that, for thousands did actually
   see Him on the Cross and they thrust out their tongues at Him and
   perished in their sins! But let me tell you that it is one of the most
   strengthening things to our piety to get to feel, by faith, as though
   we did behold the Savior! We do not expect to see Him until He comes,
   yet when we have been alone in our chamber we have as much realized His
   Presence without the use of our eyes as if we had literally seen Him.

   He has been certainly sensibly crucified before us, for this is the
   point. He says that he had set forth Christ with such vividness--he had
   word-painted so thoroughly well, he had spoken so plainly and so
   simply--that they seemed to say, "We see it! Christ in our place!
   Christ bleeding for our sin!" They seemed to see Him as if He were
   before them in their midst. My dear Friends, do not say, "Christ died
   on Calvary. That is thousands of miles off." I know that He did, but
   what does it matter where He died as to locality? He loved you and gave
   Himself for you. Let Him be to you as though He were crucified at
   Newington--and as though His Cross were in the middle of this
   Tabernacle!

   "Oh, but He died 1900 years ago." I know He did, but the efficacy of
   His death is a thing of today! "He died unto sin once"--and that once
   pours the splendor of its efficacy all down the ages and the thing for
   you to do is to feel as if you saw Him dying now, on the Cross
   now--with you standing at the foot of the Cross and looking up and
   seeing Him looking down from that Cross and saying, "I did all this for
   you." Cannot you ask the Lord to make it as vivid as that to you? I
   need, while I am looking upon this great throng, to forget you all and
   to see Jesus standing here with the nail prints! Oh, if I could see
   Him, how humbly I would throw myself at His feet! With what love would
   I embrace Him! With what reverence would I adore Him!

   But, my Master, I am so sure of the fact that You did die in my place
   and that my sins were laid on You, that even now I see You discharging
   all my debt and bearing all my curse. Though You are gone to Glory, yet
   I vividly realize that You were here. This has become a fact to me.
   Whenever you get into company where they are talking about the
   Doctrines of Grace and sneering about them and whenever you get into
   another class of company where they say, "Away with your simple worship
   of God! You must have priests and incense and altars and all"--do not
   argue with them. Get alone and ask to see Jesus Christ over again. See
   if there is anything of popish finery about Him! See if there is
   anything of this philosophy, falsely so called, about Him!

   You will determine as soon as you have seen Him that you will call
   everything else vanity and lies and bind His Gospel to your heart! The
   Cross is the school of orthodoxy. Endeavor to stay there! While I have
   been alone on the Continent I have, in my quiet moments, had
   realizations of my Master's Presence and then I have wished that I
   could borrow the wings of a dove, so that I might, then and there,
   stand up and talk to you. I have been very sick and full of pain and
   depressed in spirit and I have judged myself to be, of all men, most
   unworthy and I judged truly. I still stand to that judgment. I felt
   myself only worthy to be shaken like dust from off the feet of my Lord
   and cast into the bottomless pit forever.

   Then it was that my Substitute was my hope and in my lonely chamber at
   Mentone I clung to His dear garment! I looked into His wounds! I
   trusted myself with Him, again, and I know that I am a saved man! I
   tell you there is no salvation in any other, but only in Jesus! You
   will not be led away to any other doctrine if you will return
   continually to this Truth of God. Some men want a sound pummeling with
   affliction to get them to love Christ. And some old professors need a
   touch of poverty, sometimes, or a little affliction, or a rack of
   rheumatism and that brings them to their bearings and they begin to cry
   out after realities and get rid of whims and fancies!

   When it comes to close dealings between God and your soul--and death
   stares you in the face--nothing will do but a crucified Redeemer and no
   confidence will do but a sinner's childlike reliance upon the finished
   work of Him who suffered in our place! I speak strongly, but I feel a
   thousand times more strongly than I can speak.

   III. The last point is THE SUPREME FOLLY of those who would leave Jesus
   for anything else. Suppose that a man should once have simply trusted
   in Jesus Christ and have realized the death of Christ and have come
   into real contact with the dying, bleeding Master. And suppose that,
   after that, he should begin to put his confidence in priests and
   sacraments. Or, suppose that he should, after that, put on his lavender
   kid gloves and become a philosopher--what would he be? Now, do not tell
   anybody, I pray you. Keep it to yourselves! The Apostle Paul did not
   affect the manners of a gentleman, but he spoke very plainly, indeed.
   Do not tell your learned neighbors that I said it, because I did not
   say it--it is Paul that said it! He says that a man who should do that
   would be A FOOL!

   "Oh, foolish Galatians!" What are you saying, Paul? They have only been
   decorating their service--surely you cannot object to that! Don't you
   know, Paul, that the old Jewish priest used to wear a splendid
   breastplate worked with jewels and he had an ephod adorned with bells
   and pomegranates? Surely in the worship of God we ought to do things
   decorously and properly! And on this plea these Galatians have
   exceedingly decked themselves out. "They are foolish Galatians!" Paul
   says. Very rude of him, mark you--very rude of him! But I shall not
   attempt to excuse him, for I fully endorse his verdict.

   But here is a gentleman who has been reading Plato and, after reading
   Plato, he has been reading the words of Jesus Christ and he says that
   they do not mean what the common people think they mean--he says there
   is a very mysterious philosophical sense hidden within them. For
   instance, when Jesus Christ says, "These shall go away into everlasting
   punishment," it does not mean at all what the words say! It means that
   they shall ultimately be restored. Now, Paul, this

   gentleman is a philosopher--what do you say of him? He says, "He is
   foolish!" That is all he says and all that he needs to say, for learned
   folly is folly at its height! "Oh, foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched
   you?"

   Why do we think these people foolish? Because we should be foolish,
   ourselves, if we were to do the same! A good many years ago, when I was
   about 15 or 16 years of age, I needed a Savior and I heard the Gospel
   preached by a poor man who said, in the name of Jesus--"Look unto Me
   and be you saved, all the ends of the earth." It was very plain English
   and I understood it and obeyed it and found rest! I owe all my
   happiness, since then, to the same plain doctrine. Now, suppose that I
   were to say, "I have read a great many books and there are a great many
   people willing to hear me. I really could not preach such a commonplace
   Gospel as I did at the first. I must put it in a sophisticated way so
   that none but the elite can understand me"?

   I would be--what would I be? I would be a FOOL, written in large
   capital letters! I would be worse than that--I should be a traitor to
   my God, for if I was saved by a simple Gospel, then I am bound to
   preach that same simple Gospel till I die so that others, too, may be
   saved by it! When I cease to preach salvation by faith in Jesus, put me
   into a lunatic asylum, for you may be sure that my mind is gone. There
   are hundreds of you who feel perfectly happy in Christ. You believe
   that all your sins are washed away, that you are justified by the
   Righteousness of Christ and accepted in the Beloved. Now, suppose that
   you give that up and say, "Instead of believing in Christ's dying once
   and making an Atonement, I am going to believe in the perpetual
   sacrifice offered by a human being in the 'mass'"?

   You would be very foolish! Suppose that, instead of trusting in Jesus
   Christ for perfect pardon and justification, so that you know that
   there is no condemnation to you because you are in Christ Jesus, you go
   back to works and say, "I am going to work out my own salvation by my
   own good works"? You would be foolish to the last degree and you would
   soon discover the fact by the misery that would come over your spirit.
   Look again! When you have lived nearest to Christ and trusted most in
   Him, have you not felt most desire after holiness? Now, tell me, if you
   have tried the modern views, what state of mind have you been in with
   regard to your daily walk?

   I will tell you. You could, with those modern views, frequent the
   theater and the music hall and feel quite easy. And you could do a
   sharp trick in business and feel comfortable. But you know that when
   you have seen Christ you cannot do anything of the kind! You are
   sanctified by His Presence. You feel a strong desire after perfect
   purity. You feel a horror and a dread of sin. You walk tenderly and
   cautiously and you are bowed down by distress of mind at the thought of
   your imperfections. Judge, then, which must be the right doctrine--that
   which makes you most holy must certainly be true! But if you turn away
   from your Lord, whose very Presence breathes sanctification and
   communion with Him is sure to bring holiness, you will be a fool! And
   we shall have to say, "Oh, foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you?"

   During the last few meetings that we have had here, my dear Brothers
   Fullerton and Smith have been preaching the Gospel--the straight-out
   Gospel of Jesus Christ. And at one meeting, held afterwards, there were
   scores of persons who rose up to tell of what that ministry had done
   for their souls by God the Holy Spirit. There were thieves reclaimed,
   drunks reclaimed, harlots reclaimed, great sinners reclaimed! Well,
   now, suppose that, after all, some of you ladies and gentlemen should
   say, "We see what the Gospel can do, but we are going to try something
   else"? You would be fools! I am always ready to try a new machine--we
   will try the electric light one of these days instead of gas when we
   are sure of it--but suppose that it should all go out and leave us in
   the dark! I will wait till the invention has been tested!

   So it may happen with the new religious lights that men bring up which
   are like dim rush lights compared with the blazing sun of Gospel
   Truth--we are not going to try anything new to the risk of our souls.
   We are going to keep to the old, old Gospel until it is worn out. When
   it gets worn out and will not save any more and will not comfort any
   more and will not draw us near to God any more, then will be the time
   for us to think of something fresh. But as that has not come to pass, I
   beg to say that I will drive another nail into my old colors and fasten
   them anew to the old mast!

   What I have preached among you these 26 years I will preach again, for
   I am determined to know nothing among men but Christ and Him Crucified!
   And may neither the preacher become a fool, nor any of his hearers
   become fools, by being bewitched, so that they forsake the glorious
   Gospel of Jesus Christ! Oh that you all knew its power and were all
   saved by it! God grant that you may be, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

Samuel and the Young Man Saul

   (No. 1547)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to
   Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand
   still awhile, that I may announce to you the Word of God." 1 Samuel
   9:27.

   THIS was Samuel's third interview with this goodly young man. He had
   spoken with him and entertained him in his parlor, giving him the place
   of honor. He had afterwards spent the evening with him in quiet on the
   housetop and now, that they were about to part, he took a fresh
   opportunity of speaking to him. This time he spoke to him with great
   closeness of personal application, sending Saul's servant away that he
   might say things to Saul which nobody else might hear. He tried to
   speak to the young man's inmost soul. The Prophet felt a deep
   solemnity--his whole heart saying every word that fell from his lips.
   He knew that this young man was about to be made a king, to take upon
   him very heavy responsibilities and he might either be a great curse to
   Israel or a great blessing and, therefore, the man of God, with all the
   gravity of his years and all the earnestness of his loving spirit,
   said, "Stand still awhile, that I may announce to you the Word of God."

   I think I hear his earnest tones and accents sweetened by a great love,
   for Samuel loved Saul and it was his affection which made him speak so
   earnestly and pointedly. I may have among my hearers at this moment
   some to whom I have spoken many times, but I should like once more to
   have a special, personal interview with them. Come, young man, step
   aside and let me speak with you. Try and think that no one is here
   except the preacher and yourself and that he speaks to you when he
   speaks. I long this time to do my Master's work thoroughly with you in
   the power of the Spirit of God. This time the preacher would hold you
   fast, as if he said to each one, "I will not let you go unless you give
   your heart to Christ and become His servant from this very hour."

   There are two things in the text about which I wish to speak. Here is
   the first--the attention which Samuel requested and the second, on
   which we shall dwell at greater length, concerns the subject upon which
   he spoke.

   I. First, let us think upon THE ATTENTION WHICH SAMUEL REQUESTED. He
   said to the servant, "Pass on before us," and he passed on. Will you,
   also, kindly try to dismiss from your minds any other thoughts besides
   those which we will try to bring before you? Bid the servant pass on.
   Forget, for a while, your business. Forget your family. Forget your
   joys, forget your sorrows. You have had enough of these, I dare say,
   all week. Perhaps you have been haunted by them in your sleep. Maybe
   your dreams have been rendered unhappy by the rehearsal of your trials.
   By an effort of your mind, in which God will help you, try to make
   these servants pass on.

   I wish I could so speak that men would say of my preaching what they
   said of Whitefield's. One man said, "Whenever I went to Church before,
   I calculated how many looms the church would hold"--for he was a
   weaver--"but when I heard Whitefield I never thought of a loom."
   Another said, "While I have been in Church I have often built a ship
   from stem to stern. But when I heard Mr. Whitefield I could not lay a
   plank! He took my mind right away from such things and occupied me with
   higher thoughts." I pray you, help me in my endeavor to engross your
   attention. Let the ships go and the looms go and the kitchens go and
   the businesses go--send the servants away and be alone, now, with
   yourself and your God.

   The next point in the attention requested was the desire that Saul
   would "stand still a white." They had been walking quietly down the
   hill till they had gone past the last house in the town. And when they
   had come fairly into the fields, Samuel said, "Stand still awhile"--as
   much as to say, "I have something important to say and you will hear it
   better if you are quiet and motionless as to your body, but especially
   if your mind can be still. Forget the asses that you sought after and
   your father's house and all home concerns and calmly listen to me." It
   is a very desirable thing when we are listening to the Gospel, to let
   it have its full effect upon us, to give our minds up to it and
   say--"Let it come like the dew

   and soak into my mind as the dew into Gideon's fleece. Let it come like
   a shower and let it enter into my very nature as the rain into the
   clods which are softened by the gentle influence of the showers."

   I pray you bask in the Gospel as men do in the sunlight when they would
   be warm. Let the Gospel have its own legitimate effect upon you. Lay
   bare your bosom to it. Ask that your soul may have no stone of
   carelessness laid upon it, as though it were a dead thing in a
   sepulcher, but that it may come forth in resurrection life through the
   quickening Word of the Divine Spirit. Is not this what the Word of God
   deserves? Should it not have our living, loving attention? When God
   speaks, let all be silent! Hush, you senators, if God speaks! Sit
   still, you princes, if the King of kings lifts up His voice! Quiet,
   even you celestial choirs, if Jehovah speaks! An obedient homage should
   be paid to the voice of God by the deep awe and reverence of the
   spirit.

   Do you ever get alone and sit still and say, as Samuel did, in the dead
   of night, "Speak, Lord, for Your servant hears"? If you never do that,
   the little child Samuel may well rebuke you. He was willing that God
   should speak to him. But, oh, we are so busy! So busy! So sadly busy! I
   have heard that the great clock at St. Paul's can scarcely be heard in
   Cheapside because of the traffic that is going by--and so the most
   solemn voices are drowned amidst the din and uproar of our business and
   we do not often hear God's voice unless we are accustomed to give
   ourselves a little quiet and holy stillness and sit in our chamber
   alone and say, "Now, Lord, commune with me. I wish to hear Your voice.
   I open my Bible. I am about to read a few verses. Oh, speak with me."

   I do not believe there would be very many persons left unconverted if
   it were their habit and practice, day by day, to open the Word of God
   with the desire that God should speak to them. Come then, dear Friends,
   send your servants away! Forget your business and stand still that I
   may announce to you the Word of God! As the Word of God deserves such
   quiet attention, it certainty is only by such attention that it is
   likely to bless us. Faith comes by hearing, but not by such hearing as
   some men give, for the Word goes in one ear and out the other. They
   hear the Gospel as though it were an idle tale, or a merry song to
   which they listen at a street corner and then go their way. No, if you
   would get the blessing, you must hear as for eternity, with your ears
   and with your whole heart, praying while you hear, "Lord, bless this to
   me! Lord, bless this to me!"

   I remember a child who used to be noted for great attention during
   sermons and his mother, noticing his deep earnestness, asked him why.
   He said, "Because, Mother, I heard the preacher once say that if there
   was a piece of the sermon that was likely to be of good to our souls,
   Satan would try to make us lose it. And as I do not know which part God
   will bless me by, I try to hear it all and to remember it all." Oh,
   when people come to listen to the preacher with such a spirit as that,
   it is sweet work to preach! You can easily feed hungry horses and you
   can easily feed souls that hunger and thirst after righteousness--"They
   shall be filled." The Lord help us to give earnest heed to His own
   saving Word! "Stand still awhile, that I may announce to you the Word
   of God."

   But many things arise to prevent this attention. You cannot get some
   folks to sit still--they are so frivolous you cannot make them think.
   Some men dread the process of thinking almost as much as they would a
   touch of the "cat" on their backs. They cannot bear to consider and
   meditate. God has distinguished them above brutes by giving them the
   faculty of thought, but this high privilege they try to ignore! Any
   silly tale, or idle song, or light amusement, or pastime will entice
   them, but they have no soul for serious things. They go through life,
   not as the bee, which sucks honey from every flower, but as the
   butterfly which regards the garden as only a place over which it may
   flit and where it may occasionally alight, but gather nothing and so
   begins and ends its gaudy day and has nothing in store. Let us not be
   the fluttering insects of an idle day. God grant we may not follow the
   fashion of this foolish world. May frivolity and levity be taken away
   from us and may we, in sober earnestness, attend to things eternal.

   Others, on the other hand, are so exceedingly careful about the things
   of this world that you cannot get them to think of the Word of God.
   What is Heaven to them? They know a plan for making a large profit. You
   shall talk to them of Christ and all His beauties, but they will not
   afford you a thought. But jingle a half-sovereign near them and you
   shall excite all their desires! Inform them how they could be rich and
   famous and they will pay you for the prescription. But tell them about
   Christ and you must beg and pray them to read half a page of Scripture.
   And as to listening to your ser-mon--the thing is dry--they turn away
   from it! O you money-grubbers, have you souls at all, or are you
   nothing else but bodies? Are you mere leather purses for holding money?

   Do you expect to live in the future--to live in eternity--or do you
   think that you shall die like the dog that follows at your heel? O my
   Hearer, if you are not immortal, I can well excuse you that you think
   not of immortality! But if, indeed, you are a man made in the image of
   God and destined to live forever, it is but the most common common
   sense that you should begin to prepare for those eternal abodes in
   which you are to dwell world without end! Stand still awhile and let
   nothing come in to break the silence of your spirit while you listen to
   the voice of God! I would earnestly persuade everyone here who is not
   saved to get an hour alone somehow. Make up your mind to do so! Shut
   yourself up and give an hour to solemn, earnest thought and
   consideration of your condition before God. I am persuaded that
   scarcely one would do that solemnly and earnestly but what it would end
   well and we should have, by-and-by, to bless God for the happy result
   of that hour.

   II. We now leave the point of the attention to be given, to consider
   THE SUBJECT UPON WHICH SAMUEL DISCOURSED with Saul, or rather the
   subject about which I would discourse at this time, if I am so happy as
   to have secured your ears. He says, "Stand still awhile, that I may
   announce to you the Word of God." The subject is the Word of God! That
   God should give us a Word at all is very gracious. It is wonderful that
   He should condescend to speak to us because we cannot understand
   much--we are like little children at the very best. For our heavenly
   Father to bring down the great meanings of His vast mind into human
   language is something very wonderful!

   When He spoke on Sinai with the accompaniment of tempest and lightning,
   it was a gracious thing for God to speak to man--but in these last days
   He has spoken to us by His Son Jesus Christ who is the Word--Jesus has
   come down into this world on purpose to interpret God to man! A man's
   mind goes to another man's mind by a word--the word tells what was in
   the speaker's thought. So Christ comes from God to us. God says to us,
   "You wish Me to speak--that is My speech--My SON. Read My love to you
   in the fact that I gave My Son! Read My justice, for I made Him bleed!
   Read My Mercy, for in Him I pass by transgression, iniquity and sin."

   Does God speak in such golden language? Does He really speak by His own
   Son, the Eternal Word? And need I ask that He should have a hearing?
   Shall it have come to this, that God shall give up the darling of His
   bosom to a cruel death and yet we will turn aside and will not regard
   it? The Lord grant us deliverance from such madness and wickedness and
   help us to feel if salvation is worthy of the death of the Son of God,
   it must be worthy of our attention! If Jesus thought it worth His while
   to bleed upon the Cross for man's salvation, it is worth my while to
   put everything aside till I am saved! It is worth my while to get to my
   chambers and shut the door and feel as if I never would rise from my
   knees till I had found peace with God through Jesus Christ! God is
   engaged in man's salvation, even the Father! Jesus was engaged in it,
   even the blessed Son! And the Holy Spirit is engaged in it, even the
   Divine Convincer of sin! Surely that which occupies the Infinite mind
   of the three blessed Persons of the Divine Unity, must surely call to
   every wise man to lend his ears and give it all his thoughts that he
   may receive, obtain, possess, enjoy and delight himself in the precious
   things which God gives us freely in Christ Jesus!

   Then, dear Hearer, be thoughtful and, "Stand still awhile, that I may
   announce to you the Word of God." In the particular Word of God which
   Samuel spoke to Saul there was some likeness to the message which I am
   bound to deliver to you. For, first, Samuel spoke to Saul about a
   kingdom of which this young man should be the king. He never dreamed of
   that before. He had thought of his father's donkeys, but a throne and a
   crown had never entered his mind. Do you know, O strange young man, you
   who have stolen into this service, that there is such a thing as the
   Kingdom of God? Jesus said, "Seek you first the kingdom of God and His
   righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you."

   Do you know, young man, that you may be a king? Yes, if you give good
   heed to the Gospel, you shall be a king and sing with us unto the Lord
   Jesus, for He has made us kings and priests unto God and we shall reign
   with Him. Are you occupied entirely with your business, with seeking
   after a degree at the University, with striving to pass an examination
   or gain employment? I will not call you away from such pursuits, yet
   there is something higher than these. You may not be contented with
   such things as these, for God calls you, He calls you to a higher
   destiny, to something noble, so noble that those who share in it rank
   higher than the kings of the earth!

   Little did Saul dream that on this day the kingdom would be given to
   him and little do you dream of it, perhaps, as yet. But I pray you, let
   me announce to you the Word of God, for you may yet find a kingdom
   there, a kingdom for you, a crown of life for you which fades not and a
   seat at the right hand of God with Christ in the day of His appearing!
   Samuel not only spoke about the kingdom, but he announced to Saul the
   Word of God by an anointing. He took out a flask

   which contained a little oil and he poured it on his head. "O my
   Hearer, stand still awhile" and I will tell you of an anointing! If you
   regard this present voice of God and do heartily incline your ears and
   come unto Christ that you may live, you shall, by so doing, receive an
   anointing from the Holy One by which you shall know all things that
   concern your soul and your God!

   You say, "I know little about religion." You shall be taught of God,
   for this is the promise--"All your children shall be taught of the Lord
   and great shall be the peace of your children." You say, "I am not
   capable of high and noble things." You shall be made capable, for in
   the day when God anoints you, you shall receive strength--"To as many
   as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God." You
   shall receive enlightenment and illumination by the Divine unction of
   the Holy Spirit! Have you ever thought of this? There is not only water
   to wash you, but oil to anoint you! Christ can take away your sin at
   this moment and He can also give you Grace so that you shall leave off
   the habits which up to now have bound you down! You can become a new
   creature in Christ Jesus! Is not such a gracious visitation worth
   standing still to receive?

   Samuel spoke to Saul about another matter, namely, about a change that
   he would undergo. For as he talked with him, he said, "You shall meet a
   company of Prophets and you shall prophesy and become another man."
   Little can you tell, my dear Friend, what God will do with you. If you
   are willing and obedient you shall eat the good of the land. If the
   Spirit of God shall lead you in penitence to confess your sin and in
   humble, childlike faith to lay hold on Christ, you shall become, in a
   higher sense than Saul ever was, "another man!" You shall be born
   again! You shall be a new creature in Christ Jesus! Listen to these
   words of the blessed Covenant, for I would hold you and announce to you
   the Word of God. "I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take
   the stony heart out of their flesh and will give them an heart of
   flesh." "I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart
   from Me."

   "I could never be a Christian," says one. No, not as you are, but you
   shall be made a new man and the new man is made in the image of Christ
   and is a Christian! Have you ever heard of this? This being changed?
   This being totally changed? Have you ever heard that God can create you
   for the second time? That He can destroy in you the power of sin and
   bring you under another dominion and make you as eager after right as
   you have been after wrong and make you as happy in the service of
   Christ as ever you were in the service of the devil, yes and 10,000
   times more so? And oh, I would not wonder, though you think it cannot
   be, He will open your mouth to talk to others about Christ!

   Though, young man, you little dream of such a thing at this moment, it
   may be the Lord has sent me to call you to Himself that you may
   surrender yourself to Jesus and then, in some future day, you shall--

   "Stand and announce to sinners round What a dear Savior you have
   found," and be as enthusiastic in the service of the Lord Jesus as ever
   you have been in the frivolities of the world! Does something in your
   heart say, "I wish that it would so happen to me"? Is there a secret
   something in your heart echoing to that which I am saying? Oh Lord,
   grant that it may be so! This is what we want you to think about, then,
   the Kingdom, the anointing and the change that God can work in you. If
   you will come and think well of the Word of God, you will see in it
   that which will meet all the past of your life, whatever it has been.
   There may be blots upon it, but in the Word of God you will find that
   which will wash them all away.

   You may have wept over your life and yet cannot wash away its
   stains--but the Word of God will tell you how you shall be made whiter
   than snow and made to start again in life, delivered from every crimson
   stain! As to the present, does it puzzle you? Ah, well it may, for life
   is a tangled skein to those who know not God. But you shall find the
   clue of it, you shall thread the labyrinth, you shall see how even your
   afflictions work for your good, how your sickness means your health,
   how your being out of work and in poverty is to make you rich, how even
   your lying at death's door is sent to give you life and you shall so
   understand the present as to feel that with all its apparent evil it is
   working for your good!

   And as to the future, would you read aright your destiny? My Lord can
   tell you the future by making you know that, "Surely goodness and mercy
   shall follow you all the days of your life and you shall dwell in the
   house of the Lord forever." Oh that men would not neglect the Word of
   God, either in the hearing of it preached, or in the private reading of
   it in their homes! For believe me, there is something in the Bible
   which suits just you. Poor fallen woman, have you strolled in here
   tonight? There is something for you in the Holy Scriptures! Poor
   despairing man, far gone in despera-

   tion, there is something in the Book on purpose for you! I used to
   think that a certain text in the Bible was written with a special view
   to my case. It seemed to me that it might have been penned after I had
   lived, so accurately did it describe me.

   Even so, dear Friend, there is something in the Bible for you! Just as
   when you have lost a key and you cannot open a drawer you send for a
   locksmith, God turns over no end of skeleton keys till, at last, He has
   got the right one and He moves the bolt for you! So is it with the
   Scriptures--there is a key for every lock, there is a clue for every
   difficulty--a help for every trouble and a comfort for every grief.
   Only stand still awhile and let us announce to you the Word of God!
   Some Christian Brother may find the key for you, or you may stumble on
   it while searching the Word for yourself. Or the Holy Spirit may bring
   it to you. There is a word to suit your case--therefore give the Book a
   fair opportunity and stand still and hear the Word of God.

   Let me say to you, you may not know the Word of God, but the Word knows
   you! You know not the Scriptures, but the Scriptures know you as you
   will never know yourself, for the Word of God is quick and powerful and
   is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Many and many
   a time have persons written to me, or spoken with me and said, "Did you
   intend, in the sermon, to make a personal allusion to me?" I have said,
   "Yes, I did. Most certainly I did! But I never saw you in my life and
   never knew anything about your case, only He that sent me bade me say
   this and that and He knew who would be there to hear it and He took
   care to guide His servant's thoughts and words so as to suit your case
   to the letter so that there could be no mistake about it." The letter
   came to the man's house, as it were, with precise directions and there
   was no question that God had sent it to his soul. Now, therefore, my
   Hearer, go to the Word of God and it will speak home to you, if you go
   with the desire to be personally dealt with.

   Dear Friends, he who speaks to you at this time can honestly say that
   he is speaking out the burden of his heart. I came not here to speak
   with you, young man, without first earnestly asking to be directed in
   each word I say. And what motive can I have in all the world in urging
   you to seek the Savior's love but your good? Will it concern me, do you
   think, at the Last Day, whether you are saved or not? If I set Christ
   before you faithfully, I shall be clear of your blood--fully clear even
   if you reject my Lord. But I would put my hand on you, as I do not
   doubt Samuel did on Saul, and plead with you for your own sake, for the
   sake of all the future that lies before you, for the sake, perhaps, of
   some in Heaven whose last words were, "Follow me"-- for the sake of a
   mother who prays for you and is praying while you are sitting in this
   House of Prayer.

   Above all, I plead with you for His sake who loves to save and delights
   to bless. Oh, by the wounded hands we sung ofjust now and by the broken
   heart and by the intense affection of the ever-loving Intercessor for
   sinners, stand still awhile and seek to know the Word of God! It may be
   that at this moment you are put into a position in which you will have
   to make a choice--a choice for eternity--for Heaven or for Hell. God
   save you from making a fatal choice! There is an engagement for
   tomorrow which, if you follow it, will be your ruin. Do not fulfill it!
   May God's Spirit lead you to say at once, "I am on God's side! I must
   be and I will be. It is done, it is done! If He will have me, He shall
   have me! If He will wash me, I am ready to be washed! If He will renew
   me, I am pleading to be renewed! If He will but take me in hand and
   bring me to Himself, here I am, here I am! My Father, I have sinned
   against Heaven and before You and am no more worthy to be called Your
   son. But receive me! Take me back again."

   Ah, you backslider over there, I pray that you may be led to decide for
   the kingdom and the anointing and undergo a change at this very hour!
   Let this be the time, the set time of mercy for your soul! I should not
   wonder but that for many years to come, if we are spared, you and I, my
   Friend, who have never spoken together before, may have to rejoice over
   this present meeting! Samuel was very pleased with Saul for a long
   time, though, unhappily, Saul disappointed all his hopes. But I hope I
   have met with someone anointed of the Lord, whom He intends to bless at
   this good hour, to whom He will say, "From this day will I bless you.
   Young heart, you have yielded yourself to Me and from this day I will
   comfort you, bless you, cheer you, sanctify you, instruct you, cause
   you to grow and become strong and I will use you in My service and you
   shall be Mine in that day when I make up My jewels."

   Oh that the clock of destiny would strike tonight and you would hear it
   and solemnly declare--

   "'Tis done! The great transaction's done!

   I am my Lord's and He is mine!

   He drew me and I followed on,

   Charmed to confess the voice Divine." God grant it for Christ's sake!
   Amen.

Good News For Thirsty Souls

   (No. 1549)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JULY 4, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I will give unto him that is thirsty of the fountain of the water of
   life freely." Revelation 21:6.

   SALVATION is no small thing. It filled the heart and hands of the Son
   of God and, therefore, it ought not to be neglected by us. The precious
   promise before us concerns the gift of eternal salvation and it is set
   forth as the personal Word of the Lord Jesus Christ, Himself. The
   Apostle is very careful to make this clear, for he inserts the words,
   "And He said unto me," as if John knew that poor, troubled hearts might
   doubt so large a promise were they not assured that Jesus, Himself, had
   expressly given it. John is a faithful and true witness. In this, as in
   another case, he could have written, "He knows what He says is true."
   He declares to us that He who is Alpha and Omega, Himself, gave to him
   this word of promise. So especially careful was our Lord that the
   Gospel of Grace should be published correctly and without fail, that He
   delivered it, Himself, to John and also said to him, "Write: for these
   words are true and faithful."

   Not content with committing the message in words to the Apostle, He
   charges him, then and there, to put it down in black and white that it
   might never be forgotten. Thus He proved that He assuredly meant what
   He said and meant that it should stand good through all ages--"I will
   give unto him that is thirsty of the fountain of the water of life
   freely." It is to be noticed, too, that our Lord spoke these words as a
   King--"He that sat upon the Throne said, Behold, I make all things
   new," and then He added, "I will give unto him that is thirsty of the
   fountain of the water of life freely." Divine Sovereignty, therefore,
   is not opposed to the most generous promises of the Gospel! Jesus
   Christ may give or withhold as He pleases--but His will is to give.

   He will have mercy on whom He will have mercy and He will have
   compassion on whom He will have compassion, but the stern truth of His
   infinite Sovereignty is coupled with the sweet declaration of boundless
   charity--"I will give unto him that is thirsty of the fountain of the
   water of life freely." However much we preach the Doctrines of Election
   and Divine Sovereignty, we never intend to limit the Grace of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, but as freely as if we had not believed in Sovereignty to
   publish our Lord's generous Gospel words, "Him that comes unto Me I
   will in no wise cast out." Again, the doctrine that salvation in us as
   well as for us is entirely the work of God, is not opposed to the most
   open invitation to come to Christ, for the verse out of which we have
   culled our text begins thus--"I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and
   the End," that is to say, "I am the Founder and Finisher of salvation.
   I am the A and the Z of all life in the

   soul."

   This being accepted as the sure Truth of God, we may not, therefore,
   conclude that we are to be inactive till some miraculous work is worked
   upon us, for the promise is as true as the doctrine and it suggests
   immediate reception of Christ. "I will give to him that is thirsty of
   the fountain of the water of life freely," is an invitation to drink
   and it will be wise on our parts to accept it at once and drink to the
   fullest! There is a splendid preface to this promise in the three
   words, "It is done." This, indeed, is the reason why Grace can be so
   freely given! When our blessed Lord had completed His work on the
   Cross, He cried, "It is finished," or, "It is done," and then the
   living stream flowed freely for the sons of men! Then was the rock
   riven with rivers! Then was the stone rolled away from the well's
   mouth! Then was the water of life made to gush from under the altar to
   refresh a barren world with its ever-deepening flood!

   When this world's history is over--when the entire program of Christ's
   mediatorial work shall have been worked out and this dispensation shall
   have come to an end--then our Lord, from His Throne, shall say, "It is
   done," and this shall be sung to His Glory, that He freely gave to
   thirsty souls of the fountain of the water of life! I am most happy to
   have such a text to preach from! I pray the Lord to bless every word
   that shall be spoken and that every one of you--from those in the
   uppermost gallery, to those who crowd the far corners of the area--may
   you ALL come, this morning, to

   the celestial spring and drink and thirst no more! You have drank, some
   of you, many times--come again and take draughts large and deep, for
   the fountain is as full as ever!

   Some of you, spiritually, may be like those described by
   Coleridge--"With throats unslaked, with black lips baked." Your tongue
   cleaves to the roof of your mouth with faintness and anguish. You are
   burning with a strong desire and pressed with an urgent need. Come!
   Come and welcome! Hasten even before we enter into the sermon--drink
   from the life-giving fountain while we linger in the porch of these
   prefatory sentences! The words of the redeeming Lord invite you to
   partake of Grace at once! O Holy Spirit, apply them with power to every
   heart!

   There will be two heads of discourse at this time. The first is
   explanation and the second is encouragement.

   I. The first is EXPLANATION. We shall only mention a few very simple
   Truths of God. The first is that all souls, by nature, are in great and
   dire need. Our Lord here speaks of those who are "thirsty," and thirst
   is the index of one of our most pressing necessities. Many things we
   think we need and yet we live without them. But the need of which
   thirst is the expression is a very urgent one, involving the loss of
   all comfort and even of life, itself, if it is not supplied. A traveler
   who had experienced both hunger and thirst said, "Hunger you may
   palliate, but thirst is awful." He meant much by saying, "thirst is
   awful." There is no forgetting this pain and no stopping it except by
   drinking. When thirst swoops down upon a man from out of a burning sky,
   whether he wanders upon an ocean of sand or brine, it is a woeful day
   for him.

   Has Hell, itself, worse misery than to ask in vain for a drop of water
   to cool one's tongue? The imagination of the ancients pictured Tantalus
   as thirsty and mocked by water up to the chin which fled from him as he
   stooped. The pain of thirst is keen to the last degree and the desire
   to drink is intense beyond imagination. Need of water is a terrible
   need, but the need of Divine Grace is even more dreadful! And such is
   the need of all our race. Every man, by nature, needs Grace. He does
   not always know what he needs and, indeed, many are so insensible that
   they do not feel their soul's necessities-- yet those necessities are
   none the less urgent! There is a void within men which the whole world
   cannot fill. The experiment of filling the heart with the world has
   been tried and it has failed!

   Alexander the Great, when he had conquered the known world, sat down
   and wept because there was not another world to conquer. Insatiable is
   the heart of man--you might as soon fill the bottomless pit. As the
   horseleech cries, "Give, give, give," even so does man's ravenous
   desire! If his soul's thirst is not relieved, man must die as surely as
   though slain by the sword. To die of thirst is one of the most dreadful
   of deaths--may none of you perish with spiritual thirst. Dear Souls,
   you need a Savior! You need the pardon of your sins! You need to be
   made anew in Christ Jesus and, whether you know it or not, if you do
   not get these things you will die in your sins and, therefore, die
   eternally, which is the second death. If this thirst is not quenched,
   you are in a desperate plight, indeed, for there is nothing before you
   but "a fearful looking for ofjudgment and of fiery indignation."

   Some persons begin to be conscious of their soul's great need and these
   are they of whom the Savior speaks as "thirsty"--they have a dreadful
   need and they know it, by His Grace. I sometimes meet with enquirers
   who, when they are invited to believe in Jesus, reply, "I do not feel
   my need enough. I wish to take the living water, but I am not thirsty
   enough." I would have you know that frequently those are the most
   thirsty who thirst to thirst. If I know that I have a thirst, I at
   least have something! But if I am fearful that I do not even thirst,
   then my thirsting to thirst is a deeper thirst than thirst itself. I
   speak this way because of the infirmity of trembling hearts. Permit me
   to put this before you again.

   You complain that you have so hard a heart that you do not even feel it
   to be hard--this fact is a clear proof that yours is an especially hard
   heart and just so when you cry, "I desire to desire," it is clear that
   you have an especially strong desire. Besides, let me remind you that
   no man living knows to the fullest his own need of a Savior. I suppose
   if we could altogether see our desperate condition by nature, or know
   to the full the heinousness of sin, we would become mad! Do not,
   therefore, ask to feel your need above measure, but thank God that you
   know your necessity enough as to apply to Jesus for His gracious
   supplies. Come and drink! Come and drink at the flowing fountain of
   love! For if you drink, you shall live! But a mere sense of need will
   not afford you relief.

   Remember, also, that certain pains which are supposed to be a part of
   spiritual thirst are not necessarily connected with it. When a man is
   seeking Christ, it often happens that the devil comes in and suggests
   all manner of blasphemies and despairing thoughts. Do not be so foolish
   as to conclude that you are not thirsting after Christ because you have
   happily been free from these diabolical insinuations. They are not the
   work of the Spirit of God--they are malicious in-

   ventions of the devil and you are infinitely better without them than
   with them! I have heard of a convert who was years before he could
   trust the Savior because he thought himself to be so great a sinner
   that the Lord could not possibly save him. Do not imitate so bad an
   example! Unbelieving thoughts are no part of thirsting after Christ and
   they are not to be desired, but dreaded.

   Be very thankful if you can get to the Lord Jesus easily--it is a
   choice privilege. You know that you need Christ. You are sure that
   Christ can supply your need--therefore come and take Him without doubt
   or questions! Simple unquestioning faith is the very best way to come
   to Jesus, for it gives us speedy comfort and yields to our Lord great
   honor. People are very foolish when they look upon the diseases of
   Christians as if they were beauties. Young children have a great many
   little complaints before they grow up to be men. I need not mention
   them--every mother knows what a succession of troubles visit a large
   family. But suppose you knew one who had escaped these infantine
   disorders--what would you think of him if he were to murmur, "I don't
   think I can have been born! I don't think I can have life, for I never
   felt those complaints of infancy which other people speak of? You would
   say, "You silly man, you ought to be glad that you had such a healthy
   childhood."

   Diseases are, in a measure, marks of life, for we may be sure that the
   dead do not suffer from them--but they are not necessary as proofs of
   vitality! Neither are doubts, despondencies and despairs at all
   necessary as tokens of regeneration. Do you need Christ? Do you desire
   Him? Do you seek Him? Then you are included in this text--"I will give
   unto him that is thirsty of the fountain of the water of life freely."
   Do not look upon your thirst as a preparation for Christ, for thus you
   will be seduced into making a Christ out of your own needs and that
   will be ridiculous and ruinous! What would you think of a man who
   expected to find a remedy in his disease? He must be bereft of reason
   who expects to find an antidote within the poison!

   In our case we have to deal with an Omnipotent Physician and however
   remarkable may be the development of our disease, the Lord Jesus knows
   the situation and is able to overcome all the difficulties of it and
   bring us sound health. Therefore, come and trust Him! Do you perceive
   your nature's great and urgent need of Christ and do you desire Christ?
   If so, this text is for you, "I will give unto him that is thirsty of
   the fountain of the water of life freely." Thirst is a desire arising
   out of a need. Now, so long as you have that desire, you need not stop
   to question your right to take Christ! A man is thirsty, even if he
   cannot explain what thirst is and how it comes. I must confess, myself,
   that I could not give you a physiological account of the origin and
   effect of the phenomenon of thirst. I suppose that certain organs which
   require moisture begin to dry up or collapse without it and so
   disarrange the functions and cause pain.

   If I were some learned anatomist I could give you a lecture upon the
   theory of thirst and yet, though I cannot do this, I know practically
   what thirst is as well as a doctor could tell me. When I am thirsty and
   am invited to drink, I do not refuse because I cannot explain my
   thirst. Nor is there any absolute necessity, in order to salvation,
   that you should know all about how it is that Christ can supply your
   needs! I may not be able to explain scientifically why this glass of
   water quenches my thirst, but I know that it does--the liquid gets at
   the various organs and supplies them with what they require. I know
   enough about water to drink it when I am in need and, practically, that
   is all that is needed. If you know enough about Christ to understand
   that He can meet every need of your soul--and if you take Him to be
   your All in All--the matter is done! Remember, Jesus Christ often saves
   poor, simple-minded men when He does not save philosophers. If you take
   the Lord Jesus to be yours, you shall as truly have the benefit of His
   salvation as if you were a father in Israel.

   Let us notice, once again, that being thirsty is not enough. The text
   promises water from the fountain of life to the man who is thirsty, but
   thirst cannot quench thirst! Some seekers act as if they thought it
   would. "Oh," they say, "I am not thirsty enough. I wish I felt my need
   more!" But, my dear Friend, your thirst will not be quenched by being
   increased! "I should have some hope," says one, "if I were more
   sensible of my danger." Yet that is not a Gospel hope. Why should a
   man's despairing because of his danger operate to deliver him from
   danger? As long as you stay where you are, you may get more and more
   sensible of danger until you reach the sensitiveness of morbid
   despondency--but you will be no nearer salvation. It is not your sense
   of need, it is Christ's power to bless you and your yielding yourself
   up to Christ that will bring you salvation!

   The remedy for the thirsty soul is very plainly hinted at in the text.
   What does a thirsty man do to get rid of his thirst? He drinks. Perhaps
   there is no better representation of faith in all the Word of God than
   that. To drink is to re-

   ceive--to take in the refreshing draught--and that is all. A man's face
   may be unwashed, but yet he can drink! He may be a very unworthy
   character, but yet a draught of water will remove his thirst! Drinking
   is such a remarkably easy thing--it is even more simple than eating. I
   heard, the other day, of a sad, sad case of a man with cancer of the
   tongue who cannot eat. He has not taken solid nourishment for six
   months, but still, he can receive food by drinking. When people are
   dying you can still moisten their lips. When nothing else can possibly
   pass their throats, they can receive liquid. So, dear Soul, whatever
   your state may be, you can surely receive Christ, for He comes to you
   like a cup of cold water! Does not water run down the throat of itself?
   So is it with the Gospel. Only be willing to open your mouth to have it
   and it is yours! Nothing is simpler.

   Sometimes divines explain faith until nobody knows what it is and often
   and often I have known sinners look at their faith until they have
   quite forgotten to look to Jesus. This is as foolish as if a man
   desired to see a star and, having found a telescope, stood gazing at it
   instead of through it. Look how much he thinks of his telescope! He
   lengthens and shortens the tube and examines it up and down to see
   whether it is a good instrument. But he does not see the star! No, and
   he never will till he uses the telescope properly and looks through it.
   Do not think of believing in your own faith, but believe in Jesus!
   Subordinate faith to Christ? It would be ill, indeed, to prefer your
   cup to the fountain! When you need comfort, neither muse upon your
   need, nor study yourself, nor weigh your faith, but set your whole mind
   upon Him who is Heaven's Glory and the sinner's only hope!

   The essence of faith lies in having done with self and in receiving
   from without and that, not by any laborious process, but as easily as
   men receive water by drinking. We do not drink by machinery--we just
   open our mouths and allow the water to run down--even thus we receive
   Christ. Be willing to have Grace, be ready, as it were, to imbibe it by
   the mouth of faith. O blessed faith, which is nothing of itself and yet
   enriches its possessor! O blessed Grace, Divine living water, which is
   ours as soon as we are willing to have it! Surely there is sweet
   encouragement, here, to those poor souls who have said, "I cannot trust
   Christ. I dare not receive Him." You may freely receive Him and if you
   do but get Him, He will never leave you! If I were very, very thirsty
   and I found myself in your room and saw water on the table, I would not
   ask whether I might drink--I would drink first and ask you
   afterwards--knowing that you could not take it away from me after I had
   once drank it!

   A poor dog stands at the door of a butcher's shop. He sees meat, but he
   does not know whether he may have it. If he is very, very hungry, he
   makes a snatch at it and when he once gets it he runs off to eat it,
   for he knows that although the butcher may take it away from him when
   it is in his mouth, he cannot take it from him after he has eaten it.
   Now then, needy ones, receive the Grace of God into your inmost hearts!
   Receive Jesus into yourselves and there is no possibility that He will
   be taken away from you! Drink, thirsty one! Drink to the full! You can
   never be deprived of that which you have received into your inmost
   self!

   Thus I have endeavored to explain the text. I hope I have not darkened
   what I wished to set in clearest light. O Spirit of God, make men see
   this open secret, this plain riddle of drinking at the fountain of
   Grace!

   II. We are to speak secondly by way of ENCOURAGEMENT. I am going to
   dwell upon this figure of thirst as it is used in the Scriptures, that
   I may lead every soul that feels its need of Christ to take Him at
   once. The first encouragement is this--our Lord Jesus Christ keeps open
   house for all thirsty ones. Kindly turn to the Word of God, for we must
   back up everything with Scripture this morning. Let us read the 17th
   verse of the 22nd chapter of the Book of Revelation--"And the Spirit
   and the bride say, Come. And let him that hears say, Come. And let him
   that is thirsty come. And whoever will, let him take the water of life
   freely."

   No voice at Christ's door says, "Stay away." But three voices join with
   His in crying, "Come." The Spirit and the bride and he that hears, all
   cry, "Come!" "Come!" "Come!" No officer stands at the door to sort out
   the comers and to say, "This one may come but the other may not." The
   invitation is, "Whoever will, let him take the water of life freely."
   Said I not truly that Christ keeps open house? What can be more free or
   more comprehensive than this? Only publish it in your neighborhood that
   you intend to keep open house for a day and everybody who comes may eat
   and drink what he likes at your expense--you need not advertise it many
   times in the newspapers--only tell a few of the hungry brotherhood and
   they will swarm like bees! I will guarantee you a full table from early
   dawn to the set of sun in any of our crowded quarters, if you will only
   provide the best meat and say, "whoever will, let him come!"

   How strange it is! How sadly strange, that our Lord Jesus keeps open
   house with better food than princes ever put upon a table and yet men
   will not come! They crowd for the bread of the body, but neglect their
   souls! Our Lord bids us go into the highways and hedges and compel men
   to come, for otherwise it seems they would rather perish with hunger
   and thirst than partake of the provisions of His Grace! O, Sirs, if you
   perish, it is no fault of Christ's, for His table is furnished and the
   entrance to His banquet hall is free! In His name do I declare the
   absolute freeness of His Grace! He has taken the doors off the hinges
   to set His hall wide open! He has put away all sentinels from His table
   and ordained that none of His servants may hinder coming souls. Our
   orders are, "Whoever will, let him come," and it would be a plain
   violation of our Master's orders if we were to hinder any. His generous
   invitation is, "Come and welcome! Come and welcome! Come and welcome!
   Let him that is thirsty, come, and whoever will, let him take the water
   of life freely."

   Now, as if it were not enough to keep open house, our Lord Jesus goes
   further, for in the next place, He issues many invitations of the
   freest kind. I will only quote one out of very many. Turn to the first
   verse of the 55th chapter of Isaiah, "Ho! Everyone that thirsts, come
   to the waters and he that has no money, come, buy and eat. Yes, come,
   buy wine and milk without money and without price." Grace must be
   gratis--the word, "freely," in our text makes it clear that salvation
   is an absolute gift, but here the fact is put in a negative form that
   there may be no mistake whatever! Mercy is "without money and without
   price"--without price in any possible sense. We neither purchase, nor
   procure, nor earn, nor produce salvation by merit, effort, sacrifice,
   or service!

   It comes to us, not because we deserve it, but because we need it! We
   are blessed with it out of the goodwill and pleasure of the Lord and we
   do not purchase it by good deeds, good desires, pious resolves or
   persevering endeavors. We are empty and He fills us. In order that you
   may come to Jesus, no preparation is required. You may come just as you
   are and come at once--only confess that you need Him, desire to have
   Him and then take Him by trusting Him! He is like wine and milk,
   supplying delight and satisfaction and you are to take Him as men would
   take a drink. How could the invitation be put more broadly than it is?
   How could it be uttered more earnestly? It has a, "Ho!" to give it
   tongue. Tradesmen in certain parts of London stand outside of their
   shops and cry, "Buy, buy!" Or they yell out, "Ho!" to the passers-by
   because they are anxious to sell their wares.

   Jesus is yet more eager to distribute His rich Grace, for He longs to
   see men saved. Ho! You that pass by, stop here awhile! Turn your
   attention this way! Here is something worthy of your thoughts. "Ho!
   Everyone that thirsts, come to the waters and he that has no money."
   There are many such invitations in the Scriptures and, if not all
   expressed by the same metaphor, they are all equally as free and as
   clear as the one before us. Jesus entreats men to look to Him and live.
   He bids them come to Him and find rest for their souls. Does anyone
   say, "Well, I know that the ever-blessed Savior keeps open house and
   that He invites men freely, but still, I am afraid to come"? Perhaps,
   dear Friend, we may overcome your diffidence by the help of God if we
   remind you that our Lord makes a proclamation which has the weight of
   His personal dignity about it and comes as from a king.

   Turn to the seventh chapter of John, the 37th verse--"In the last day,
   that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If anyone
   thirsts, let him come unto Me and drink. He that believes on Me, as the
   Scripture has said, out of his heart shall flow rivers of living
   water." This is the Sovereign Word of the King of kings! Standing up in
   the midst of the multitude, He proclaimed His own full and free
   salvation! And with His own voice He declared the day of Grace, "If
   anyone thirsts, let him come unto Me and drink." O anxious Enquirer,
   what more do you need? I wish you could picture Jesus standing in our
   midst this morning and using such words! But if you cannot, if neither
   faith nor imagination can help you to realize His Presence, He is still
   here and by the mouth of His servant He still cries to this great crowd
   gathered here, "If anyone thirsts, let him come unto Me and drink."

   Will you not come? What is keeping you back? The call is to any man,
   any woman, any child, ANYBODY--anyone that needs mercy, anyone who
   desires salvation--let him come and have Jesus and eternal life! If you
   think yourself an outcast. If you seem shut out with seven bolted
   doors, yet do not take upon yourself the responsibility of condemning
   yourself. Come and try! If you thirst, come to Christ and He will give
   you Grace at once. Perhaps a trembler replies, "Yes! Here is a
   proclamation, but I should be more comforted if I could read promises."
   Our text is one of the freest promises possible--"I will give unto him
   that is thirsty of the fountain of the water of life freely." Come and
   test the promise, right now, and see if it is true or not.

   But if you require another, turn to a grand Gospel chapter in Isaiah,
   the 41st and let me read you the 17th verse. Will not this suit you?
   "When the poor and needy seek water and there is none and their tongue
   fails for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will
   not forsake them. I will open rivers in high places and fountains in
   the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water
   and the dry land springs of water." Now then, you that cannot pray! You
   that are so dried up with inward drought that you cannot get the words
   out and scarcely feel the desires within! All you whose very hearts
   fail you so that you despair of hope! Believe this promise of God who
   cannot lie and plead it before Him! See if God will not open for you
   fountains on the very mountain tops where you could least expect them
   and give you comfort which you looked not for!

   Shall I quote another promise out of many? There is a sound of abundant
   refreshment in it. It is in the 44th chapter of Isaiah, 2nd verse--"I
   will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry
   ground." He will not only give you enough to drink, but pour it on you
   to drench you with delight! Your hot and weary feet shall be ready to
   start again upon the journey of life because washed and cleansed by
   love! There is Grace enough in God to allow it to be lavished upon you.
   If I were in your case, poor thirsty Soul, I would catch at such a
   promise as that! "Lord," I would say, "I long to have You! I know I
   cannot be saved without You. I am sure that You can save me and lo! I
   trust You! If I die, I will die trusting in You!" You are saved, my
   Brother! There is no fear that God will ever reject a soul that has
   come to this--He will pour floods upon you yet!

   Our gracious Lord, still further to encourage souls to come to Him, has
   been pleased to give many gracious explanations of what He meant. You
   will find one in the 4th chapter of John. How sweetly He explained to
   the woman at the well what living water is and what drinking of it is.
   He tells you that, by believing in Him, you receive into yourself
   everlasting life. Further on, in the 6th chapter of John, at the 35th
   verse, He shows what drinking of the living water is--"And Jesus said
   unto them, I am the bread of life: he that comes to Me shall never
   hunger and he that believes on Me shall never thirst."

   I have opened up the plan of salvation many, many times, but I will try
   again. To be saved you must heartily trust Christ and Him alone. You
   are to believe on Him. First believe Him--that is, be convinced that
   what He says is true and then believe on Him--that is, depend upon what
   He has done and on what He is. He will make His Word good to you.
   Commit your soul to the Redeemer's keeping and He will keep it safely--

   "Venture on Him; venture wholly;

   Let no other trust intrude."

   There is no venture, but I put it so that you may catch the idea. Lean
   your whole weight on Jesus. Hold on to Jesus as to a life buoy. Buckle
   your fate to Jesus, to sink or swim with Him. If He is a Savior, trust
   Him! Put all your eggs into this basket. Float all your treasures in
   this vessel. Let it be so that if He can and will save sinners He will
   save you. His Word is pledged that He will save all those who trust
   Him--accept that Word as Infallible and confide all your future to its
   truth. This is the way of life.

   I tell you, beloved Hearers, that my own personal hope lies altogether
   in the hands of my Lord and in no degree elsewhere. I have now known
   the Lord some 30 years or more and at this moment, if anyone should ask
   me what is my hope of eternal life, I can only answer that it is just
   what it was 30 years ago, namely, the work and death of the Lord Jesus
   in my place. "Have you not preached the Gospel for years?" Yes, I have,
   with all my might and I have, by God's blessing, brought many thousands
   to repentance and faith. But I do not, in the slightest degree, rest my
   hope of Heaven upon my preaching. Whatever the Lord enables me to do
   for Him is His doing and His work and He alone must have the Glory for
   my preaching--I dare not claim a grain of merit for it! I have only
   Christ to trust to and I need no more. I have no righteousness of my
   own, but I trust to free Grace and dying love.

   The Cross will float me into the Port of Peace--if it does not I must
   be lost, for every other lifeboat has gone to the bottom long ago.
   Christ Jesus is my hope and I am persuaded that He is a Savior as
   suitable for you as He is for me. You young man over there, who is
   about the age which I had reached when I first trusted Christ, I pray
   you look to Him at once. Cease to be always looking to self. If you are
   thirsty, what is the good of looking down your own throat? What is the
   good of complaining that you feel too thirsty, or not thirsty enough?
   Man, rise up and drink! Poor Sinner, get away from yourself to Christ
   and take Christ into yourself as a man takes water into his body by
   simply drinking it! Take

   Christ to be your own Savior! Receive Him to be your sole reliance and
   you are a saved man! His sacred Book declares the Believer to be saved
   and if you, being a Believer, are not saved, then none of us can have
   hope!

   Furthermore, our blessed Lord, in order to make this very plain, has
   set before us lively emblems. He gives us the figure of the rock in the
   wilderness. You remember how He supplied Israel's needs from day to day
   till He brought them into rest? The sun blazed upon the desert sands
   and the pilgrims were sorely tried with thirst, so that they murmured
   and thought it better to die than to suffer such inward burning. How
   were their pains removed? Moses struck the Rock with his rod and out
   leaped a stream of which they drank with eager joy! Can you not see
   them bowing down for a drink, or holding their vessels at the place
   where first the water springs forth?

   Our Lord Jesus Christ is the smitten Rock, from where flow life and
   refreshing to all who will accept the Grace! All the need of your
   spirit, my Hearer, will be supplied if you are willing to take of this
   water of life freely. Come, dip your earthen vessel into this heavenly
   river and thirst no more. A smitten Savior is the one hope of a
   sorrowing sinner! Read Psalm 107:5 and you will find another symbol, or
   rather the same in a fresh form. "They wandered in the wilderness,
   where there is no way; they found no city to dwell in. Hungry and
   thirsty, their souls fainted in them; then they cried unto the Lord in
   their trouble and He delivered them out of their distresses." We are,
   at this moment, a great caravan traveling across this wilderness world.
   We are all in need and only God can supply us and, blessed be His name,
   that He will do if we cry to Him in our trouble and are willing to
   receive the Grace which He gives us in Christ Jesus our Savior!

   Beloved, the very cup of communion and the whole communion table,
   itself, is meant, among other gracious lessons, to teach us the way of
   salvation. Here is bread. What am I to do with it? Look at it? study
   it? Analyze it? I may, if I choose, but that is not what it was meant
   for--it was intended to be eaten--use it that way and you use it well.
   The wine, too, is meant to be drunk. It is not placed upon the table to
   be gazed upon, or to be quarreled over, or to be distilled, but to be
   drunk! This is an act which any thirsty person can perform. You poor
   souls who cannot do any good thing, surely you can receive of the food
   which your heavenly Father provides!

   If you cannot bear fruit and so give something out, you can take
   something in. If there is nothing in you, there is all the more room to
   receive of the Divine fullness! Oh then, let the communion cup,
   concerning which the Savior said, "Drink"--let that tell you how to
   receive Christ--how to be saved by heartily accepting Christ! Our Lord
   Jesus Christ, in His wisdom, has given us, in addition, many
   encouraging instances of men who have thirsted for Grace. I will not
   detain you with many of them. We sang a part of the 42nd Psalm this
   morning, where David said he longed for the living God as the hart
   pants after the water brooks. Further on in the 63rd Psalm, he cries,
   "My soul thirsts for God, for the living God!" And a few verses down he
   sings, "My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness." If you
   thirst after God you shall soon be satisfied! May your thirst increase
   until you get Him and then shall you be filled to the full.

   Once more. Our Lord has been pleased to give His own special blessing
   to the thirsty ones, for, when He opened His mouth upon the mountain
   and gave out the benedictions which commence His memorable sermon, He
   said, "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for
   they shall be filled." Oh, then, you thirsty ones, you are blessed in
   your very desires and longings! I do not know what more to say to you.
   What more could even Inspiration utter? This blessed Book has set
   before you such a wealth of precious things that one can barely imagine
   more. What is needed is that the Truth of God be applied and that you
   now come and take Christ!

   I beg you to remember that you must take Christ by a personal act, each
   one for himself or herself. Each one must willingly believe, for God
   forces Christ on no one. If I am thirsty I must drink--no well or river
   can quench my thirst if I do not personally drink. It stands just thus,
   dear Soul--you must accept Christ or you are lost! Be sure of this,
   that God Himself cannot, will not, save you unless you accept Christ!
   He is Omnipotent but He cannot act contrary to His own solemn
   declaration and He has said, "He that believes not shall be damned." If
   you do not believe in Christ you must be lost to a certainty! You must,
   yourself, believe or be a castaway! Do not think that the Grace of
   repentance or faith will be worked in you against your will. You labor
   under a great mistake if you think so! You must joyfully take Christ or
   die in your sins!

   Why should you not take Him? Is this some bitter medicine I am pressing
   on you and are you a silly child who must be coaxed into taking it? No,
   I set before you the Lord Jesus who is Sweetness itself. Why should you
   need persuading? Do you secretly hope that there may be some other
   salvation? You are greatly deceived if you do, for the Son of God would
   not have died to save if it could have been done in any other way! Of
   no other Fountain can you drink! What keeps

   you back from this? Are you trying to find reasons why you should not
   come to Christ? That is ruinous to yourself! Few persons hunt up
   arguments against themselves. If there is any money in dispute in a
   court of law, each party will hunt out reasons for his having it--I
   never saw a man stand up in court and plead against his own interests!
   Will you turn advocate for the devil against yourself? Will you urge
   arguments to seal your own condemnation?

   When Jesus Christ says, "Let him that is thirsty come," will you stand
   in your own way and block up your own path to life? Will you make God a
   liar for the sake of destroying your own soul? Surely a mania must be
   upon you! It is the wisest thing to say, "I am an undeserving,
   Hell-deserving sinner; but if God is infinite in mercy, why should He
   not save me as well as anyone else? He declares that if I trust His Son
   He will pardon me--I will trust His Son and partake of His forgiveness.
   He bids me drink of the water of life--I will drink. I will not
   question my right to come--He bids me do so and I will obey. I take Him
   at His Word. I trust in the blood of Jesus. Lord, receive me, for I
   receive Your Son. I have been trying to save myself and waiting until I
   felt something, or did something, in and of myself. But now, Lord,
   although I neither see nor feel anything but my lost estate, I do
   believe that Jesus can save me and, by Your Grace, I trust

   Him."

   If this is your true act, dear Hearer, you are a saved man! Even if you
   only believed a minute ago, you have passed from death to life! The
   moment a sinner believes, he is justified! The atoning blood operates
   the moment faith sees it. O you who have but this instant believed, go
   your way and rejoice! You are in the hands of Jesus and none can pluck
   you from Him!

   I have thus tried to preach a very plain sermon, containing the A B C
   of the Gospel. I believe that God will bless it to the conversion of
   many. I shall be terribly disappointed if He does not. I have entreated
   Him to let His own message have free course and mighty effect and I
   know that He will hear me. I beg God's people to pray that this sermon
   may enclose within the Gospel net more fish than ever we have had
   before! Some of you seekers have, up to now, thought the door of mercy
   to be bolted against you. Look! It stands wide open! Come and welcome!
   If any softness of feeling is stealing over you, let it work while you
   gladly yield. Do not talk nonsense on the way home and so lose the
   effect of the discourse. Hasten to your chambers, fall upon your knees
   and rise not till you have accepted Jesus as your own Savior. If you do
   so, salvation will have come to your house this day and God will be
   glorified. Amen and amen!

The Unspeakable Gift

   (No. 1550)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JULY 25, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift!" 2 Corinthians 9:15.

   PAUL had spoken of the liberality of the Corinthian Believers and he
   had endeavored to stir them up to a prudent preparation for displaying
   it. "Now, therefore," he said, "perform the doing of it, that as there
   was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance, also, out of
   that which you have." He closes his exhortation by this remarkable
   sentence--"Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift!"--intending, no
   doubt, to thereby give expression to his own hearty thankfulness and
   also to deliver a master stroke of argument for Christian liberality.
   Nothing can so excite God's people as to give to Him, as the
   remembrance of what God has given to them. "Freely you have received,
   freely give," is our Lord's own argument. Gospel Graces are best
   stimulated by Gospel motives.

   It is wrong to appeal to Believers by reasons drawn from the Law of
   Works, for they are not under it. Children are to be ruled as children,
   not as oxen. Appeal should be made to renewed hearts by arguments
   distilled from the Law of love under which they live! Seeing God has
   loved them with an infinite love, this love has become the most mighty
   of forces within them--"The love of Christ constrains us." Nothing can
   move a man to complete consecration to God like the fact that He so
   loved us that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in
   Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

   The Gospel is founded upon giving and its spirit is giving. Buying and
   selling are unknown in spiritual things, unless we buy without money
   and without price. Payment is for the Law. Under the Gospel, everything
   is a gift. God gives us Jesus, gives us eternal life, gives us Grace
   and glory, gives us everything, in fact, and then, moved by love to
   Him, we give ourselves back to Him and to His people. As it is the
   glory of the sun that he gives light and heat to our world, so is it
   God's Glory that He gives mercy and peace to the sons of men. And,
   moreover, as the sun is the author of reflected heat and is all the
   more valued because his beams can be reflected, so is God glorified by
   that part of His goodness which we are able to impart to others. God is
   glorified in the thanksgiving which is excited by the gifts of His
   people to the poor, as well as by their personal thanksgivings for His
   own gifts. He gives to us and we thank Him. We give to others and they
   thank God for the kindness which He has inspired in us. Thus a round of
   thanksgiving to God is created by the spirit of giving which first of
   all displayed itself in the unspeakable gift of God! We are as cups
   filled at the spring and from us the thirsty drink and praise the
   fountain!

   Paul had been boasting of the liberality of the Corinthians and he
   somewhat feared that by their delay he might be made ashamed. He seemed
   almost alarmed lest he had said too much about their gifts. He could
   speak upon that subject and say all that should be said, but he felt
   that he could not describe the liberality of God. The gifts of the
   Corinthians were such as he could speak of, but when he thought of what
   God had given, he could only cry, "Thanks be unto God for His
   unspeakable gift!" You can readily put down in black and white and
   count up the largest contributions of the most self-sacrificing
   Believers--but you cannot estimate the gift of God. You cannot estimate
   the value of God's own dear Son--you could certainly give no expression
   to any estimate you had formed if it were in the least degree worthy of
   the subject. The love which is seen in Jesus is indescribable,
   infinite, unspeakable.

   During this meditation I desire to aid you, as the Holy Spirit shall
   aid me, for in my case the power to speak of this unspeakable gift
   must, itself, be a gift. I trust it shall be given me in the same hour
   in which I shall speak. We will first consider that Christ Jesus is the
   unspeakable gift --but we are not going to be silent because of
   this--for our second head is Christ Jesus is a gift to be very much
   spoken of! The unspeakable gift is to be forever spoken of by way of
   gratitude--"Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift!"

   I. First, then, the eternal Son of God given of God unto men, CHRIST
   JESUS IS THE UNSPEAKABLE GIFT and He is so in many ways. To begin with,
   no man can doctrinally lay down the whole meaning of the gift of Christ
   to men. The Church has produced thoughtful scholars whom it has called,
   "Divines," and described as "eminent theologians." From these teachers
   we have, no doubt, received much help in the exposition of the Word of
   God and yet if we put them all together they have never been able to
   unfold to us the entire meaning of the gift of the Son of God to men!
   The devout and studious have, themselves, cried out, "O the depths,"
   but they have not pretended to fathom this abyss of mystery.

   Certain teachers have fallen far short of the mark and have done great
   mischief by their low estimate of the unspeakable gift. What they have
   said may have been true, but their sin has been one of
   omission--omission where none should have been possible. They have said
   far too little about Christ and have seemed to be afraid of extolling
   Him too highly. In the estimation of such persons, the gift of the
   Savior has been simply a display of God's good will to the race and
   nothing more: Jesus was a Divine Philanthropist and nothing else
   according to their Gospel. This is to use other balances than those of
   the sanctuary and to give short weight to the great Householder! It is
   true that God commended His love to man by the death of His Son and
   none can say too much upon this point. But there is far more in the
   gift of Christ than mere goodwill. We are glad that these men admit the
   Divine Benevolence, but we wish they could see more than that--for that
   view of our Lord which sees in Him only a display of benevolence to men
   does but dimly discern His Character and value. Certainly He is
   "unspeakable" by those who only think of Him after this fashion.

   Others have spoken of Christ as a wonderful declaration of God's
   opposition to moral evil. The death of Christ has been received by them
   as a vague expression of Divine Displeasure against sin, of course not
   dissociating it from His Benevolence towards men. Herein is truth,
   also, for how shall we ever see the purity of God more fully vindicated
   than in the exhibition of sin's result in the mortal agony and death
   throes of our Divine Lord? Yet, if this is all that any man has to say,
   he has failed to comprehend the gift of God, for the great Father has
   done far more for men by the gift of His Son than merely to intimate
   the kindness of His Nature and the results of moral evil. We admit that
   in the death of His Son the Lord has declared His love to man and His
   hatred of sin, but He has done infinitely more--the Cross is not only a
   school but a hospital--the Crucifixion not only reveals man's evil, but
   provides a remedy for it. Christ is not merely a lesson, but a gift--an
   unspeakable gift.

   Some of our brethren dwell very much, perhaps none too much, upon the
   general aspect of Christ's death towards all mankind. It is a grand
   fact that the human race is spared because Jesus died and that it is
   not only reprieved, but lifted up from degradation and put in a
   position to hear messages of mercy which, if believed, will bring
   salvation. The Lord Jesus is described in Scripture as "the Savior of
   all men, specially of them that believe." His mission is glad tidings
   both to Israel and to all people--all of Adam's seed are affected by
   His death. They do well who freely proclaim the common salva-tion--they
   cannot dwell too much upon its freeness, though I would have them not
   overlook its fullness and Sovereignty.

   We like well to hear of the effect of the Incarnation and the Atonement
   upon the entire human family as placing it under a Mediator, but we
   would also hear of the special application of redemption and its actual
   results. No one can say too much of the great Redemption, the matchless
   Propitiation--yes, though one should speak with the tongues of men and
   of angels concerning Jesus Christ in His relation to the human
   family--he need not fear that he would magnify the Lord too loftily.
   The sinner's Friend, the mighty Savior, the gracious Pardoner cannot be
   too much spoken of, for under that aspect He is truly indescribable! We
   delight, in addition to this, to speak of Christ's special relationship
   to His own people and we lay a great emphasis upon the fact of His
   Substitution in their behalf.

   We rejoice to speak of His bearing the sin of many, His being numbered
   with the transgressors, His being made sin for us, though He knew no
   sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him. Our heart
   expands, our eyes overflow whenever we dilate upon His suretyship and
   consequent Substitution. His wondrous condescending love in taking our
   place--His standing in the sinner's place that we might stand in His
   place and be accepted in the Beloved--this carries our heart away and
   we never weary of the theme! O Divine Doctrine! Full of consolation!
   Teeming with highest hopes! Gladly would we preach forever the sublime
   Truth of God of the Substitution of our Lord for us!

   Yet if this were our one theme we should still fail to express the
   unspeakable. We are apt to think that when we have laid down this
   doctrine clearly and distinctly and have admitted all that others have
   well said, that we have believed and taught all that can be known
   concerning the gift of Jesus Christ to men. But, Beloved, I am
   persuaded that it is not so.

   Beside the purpose of declaring benevolence and censuring sin, of
   lifting up the race and of effectually saving the chosen, there is yet
   more to be subserved by the Incarnation and Atonement. The purposes of
   God are manifold and a wheel is ever within a wheel with Him. I will
   not, at this time, even try to speak doctrinally beyond what I have
   already attempted, for we must stop somewhere and I will pause here, at
   the truth of His vicarious suffering--the gift is unspeakable when we
   have spoken our very best and so let this suffice.

   I bid you peer over the brink upon which I would set you. Look down
   into this abyss of love. Be you sure of this, that this depth is
   unfathomable! It is idle to attempt a definition of infinity and,
   therefore, vain to hope to declare how wide, how high, how deep, how
   broad is the wondrous gift of God to the sons of men! Theology can
   speak on many themes and she has much to say on this, but her voice
   fails to speak the whole. From the pulpit, when occupied by a gracious
   man, the confession freely comes that the heralds of the Cross are not
   able to tell all that is hidden in Christ Jesus! The gift is
   unspeakable for another reason--no man can ever set forth the manner of
   this gift. The way and method of the giving are unknown, perhaps
   unknowable and, therefore, unspeakable.

   Just think awhile. Do you understand and could you possibly explain the
   manner of the Father's giving the Only-Begotten to us? For Jesus Christ
   is not only the Father's Son, but He is God Himself, one with God! The
   gift of the Son is virtually God's giving Himself to men! There can be
   no separation between God the Son and God the Father for, says Christ,
   "I and My Father are One." "Believe Me," He says, "that I am in the
   Father and the Father in Me." Do you understand this? Is it not
   indescribable? Do not, therefore, be drawing hard and fast lines and
   speaking of Christ as suffering and of the Father as scarcely
   participating in the Sacrifice, for this may grow into grievous error!
   It has been laid down by Divines that God is impassable and not capable
   of any form of suffering. It may be so, but I fail to see Scriptural
   authority for the statement.

   That God can do what He pleases I do believe and therefore He can
   suffer, too, if He so wills. To me a God who has no feelings is a great
   deal farther off from me than my Father who is in Heaven, who can be
   grieved by my sin and can feel for my sorrow. It may be true that
   Scripture only speaks after the manner of men, but then it is as a man
   that I understand it--and it does seem to me to reveal not only a
   living God, but a feeling God. Is God glorified by being petrified?
   Read Paul's words to the Ephesian elders when he speaks of "the Church
   of God, which He has purchased with His own blood" (Acts 20:28). The
   blood of God--is not that a mistake? Certainly not, since Inspiration
   thus speaks. Sometimes expressions which are mistakes in logic may be
   more accurate descriptions than the best arranged sentences. The
   expression which looks to be a contradiction may better express the
   Truth of God than that which is verbally accurate.

   Scripture is Infallible and yet it uses none of the red tape of
   systematic theology. We swim in mysteries when we speak of the Father
   and the Son. How, then, could God give the Son to die, He being one
   with Himself--shall any man explain it? Or, if he could explain the
   mystery, can he tell us what it cost the Father to give His Son? Can a
   mother tell us how it pains her heart to part with her child? Can any
   father tell us the anguish of losing his only-begotten? What must it be
   to give up your well-beloved son to be despised and spit upon,
   maltreated and murdered? No. You do not know what it is and, therefore,
   you cannot tell what it is! You that have been bereaved of your
   dearest--you know the pang which tears the heart--but you cannot
   express your loss to others. Your grief is inexpressible. Who shall
   tell what the Father felt when He did, as it were, cast the Glory of
   the Well-Beloved to the dogs by sending Him among the wicked
   husbandmen, who said, "This is the heir, let us kill Him"?

   Who shall tell what the Eternal felt when the brightness of His Glory,
   the express image of His Person, was bound like a felon and accursed
   like a criminal? When He was mocked as an impostor and scourged as a
   transgressor, rejected as vile and slain as worthy of death? To see His
   Well-Beloved hung up like a thief and made to bear infinite agony--what
   thought the Father of this? True, "it pleased Jehovah to bruise Him. He
   has put Him to grief," but not without great self-denial on the part of
   the great Father. All the agony of Abraham, when He unsheathed the
   knife to slay his son, was but a faint type of what it cost the Father
   when He gave the Only-Begotten that He might die for us!

   A further sense of the unspeakableness of this gift will come over you
   if you attempt to measure our Lord's sufferings when He was made sin
   for us. None can declare the greatness of His sacrifice. Think of the
   Glory of Christ throughout all ages at the right hand of God and
   remember that all this was laid aside! What a descent from Heaven's
   majesty to Bethlehem's manger--from the Throne of Jehovah to the breast
   of Mary! Think of the perfect Nature of Christ's humanity and its
   consequent rest in God and yet He stooped out of His spirit's peace to
   endure the contradiction of sinners against

   Himself! Think of His infinite perfections and boundless deservings and
   of the shameful contempt that was poured upon Him! The cruel asp of
   ingratitude stung Him and the serpent of malice bit Him--and all the
   while was He Lord of All.

   Every step of His way of love is full of wonders! His becoming one with
   us according to the flesh is a great marvel. Imagine, if you can, of
   what it must mean that "the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us."
   Incarnation is but the first step, but of that first descent of love,
   who shall declare the mystery? And this was merely the beginning--He
   became a Man that He might go further and become man's Substitute. Try,
   if you can, to conceive of Incarnate God as having sin imputed to Him,
   transgression laid upon Him! Why, the very idea must have been horror
   to His perfect spirit! Imagine of Justice with its iron rod, bruising
   and pounding the innocent Son of God with vicarious griefs borne for
   us!--

   "Much we talk of Jesus'love,

   But how little is understood!

   Of His sufferings, so intense,

   Angels ha ve no perfect sense."

   "Your unknown sufferings," says the Greek Liturgy and unknown they must
   forever be. O Jesus, what a price it was that You paid! What griefs
   they were to which You bowed Yourself till You were covered with a
   bloody sweat! O Lord Jesus, the brightest spirit before Your Throne who
   has dwelt with You ever since Your Ascension cannot tell us what You
   endured! Your groans are an unspeakable gift!

   How was it that He died who is the Resurrection and the Life? And how
   was it He bore sin, even He who is none other than eternal Perfection?
   None of us can speak here, for He is the unspeakable gift. I ask you to
   follow me in another line of thought while I still talk upon the
   unspeakable. None can describe the gifts which have come to us through
   the gift of Christ. Think of what we have been delivered from--think
   awhile of what you were by nature and what you would have continued to
   have been had not Grace interposed--and what you would have become if
   Jesus had not been given to save the lost. Ah, my Brothers and Sisters,
   we are fallen already, but the full results of the Fall are not seen on
   earth. The ripe result of sin is gathered in the dark region where
   castaways dwell forever, finally banished from hope!

   They dwell where the ring of the Sabbath bell is never heard, for they
   rest not day nor night. They are where the voice of Mercy can never
   enter, for this doleful knell tolls through that dreary land with awful
   tone, "He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is
   filthy, let him be filthy still." And you and I might have been there,
   now, and shall be there yet, if Jesus Christ is not ours. Yes, and the
   brightest saints in Heaven, upon whom the eternal light has risen never
   to set, would have been now in the outer darkness, weeping and wailing
   and gnashing their teeth if it had not been for this unspeakable gift!
   The distance between the unfathomable depth of deserved woe and the
   unutterable height of infinite Grace and Glory, an angel's wing cannot
   measure! Therefore it will always be impossible to tell the height and
   depth of this unspeakable gift.

   But now think, for a while, what are the gifts which we enjoy at this
   hour. There is, first of all, the forgiveness of sins according to the
   riches of His Grace. We are washed, washed in the blood, clothed in the
   righteousness of the Son of God, adopted into the family of the Eternal
   and, "if children, then heirs; heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus
   Christ"! There comes to us, by way of adoption, all the provision,
   nurture, education and paternal love which the heavenly Father gives to
   all the children of His family. Brothers and Sisters, I have not time
   to mention, one by one, all the Covenant blessings. All things are in
   the Covenant, whether things present, or things to come, or life, or
   death--all things are yours and you are Christ's and Christ is
   God's--and all these things come to us through Christ. God spared not
   His own Son and, in giving Him to us, He has also freely given us all
   things.

   Now, who is he that can speak of such a theme as this, for if he does
   but dwell upon the blessings which flow to us from Jesus Christ, he
   must be lost in wonder! Other gifts may amaze us, but this utterly
   overwhelms us! If the streams are fathomless, who shall find a plummet
   to measure the fountain? I preached last Lord's-Day night to a great
   congregation that had come for many miles and, being faint and thirsty,
   they emptied many buckets of water which were set for them. Their
   thirst consumed a great quantity, yet an observer might soon have known
   how much they drank. But who shall tell what the earth drinks in during
   a single thunder shower? Who shall measure the floods which roll down
   the great rivers? Who shall compute the volume of the sea? Yet all
   these are finite and may be reckoned up in order--our Lord Jesus Christ
   is Infinite. Of man's gifts to man we may readily make an estimate, but
   when you come to the gift of Christ, arithmetic is baffled and even
   imagination is outstripped.

   Other themes we may hope to compass by study and careful speech, but
   before this we are dumb with astonishment. Boundless Grace, unutterable
   Mercy, Divine Love--these are heavenly things and tongues of clay can
   never fully declare them! Furthermore, the gift of God must always be
   unspeakable because when it is best realized, the effect it produces
   upon the emotions is so great that speech fails. I would not give much
   for the man who can at all times fluently talk about the love of God in
   Christ Jesus. When he feels most his obligations, his heart will check
   his lips! Utterance belongs not to the deepest emotion. Only believe in
   your heart that God has given Christ to you, and all that comes with
   Him, and you will rise from your bended knees weeping for joy! A sense
   of forgiven sin through the atoning Sacrifice will master you!

   When Jesus bares His heart before you, can you speak? I will defy you
   to play the orator when love holds you beneath its spell! You will have
   a longing to tell the story, but an incapacity to fulfill your desire.
   Some feelings are too big for expression. The griefs that prattle are
   but small--great griefs are silent. Mercies which make us talk are
   common and no longer wondered at, but those which come with an unveiled
   Divinity about them are like Moses, too bright to look upon! A sense of
   Covenant Love binds a man to his place and makes him sit down like
   David before the Lord and bow his head and cry, "Why this to me? Is
   this according to the manner of man, O Lord God?" Yes, the gift must be
   unspeakable because the more it is appreciated the more are we
   silenced--the deeper our sense of its value the less is our power to
   impart it to others.

   Power to speak of the love of Christ is not always to be taken as an
   evidence of true religion, nor is its absence a matter for alarm. I
   remember one dear lover of Christ who wished to join a certain Church
   but her testimony of experience was very slender. Indeed, she said too
   little to satisfy the Brothers who came to speak with her and they told
   her so. When, bursting through all bonds she finally cried out, "I
   cannot speak for Him, but I could die for Him." Many are in the same
   plight and, in a measure, all true souls lie under the same difficulty.
   We could more easily die for Christ than hope to explain fully our
   sense of His dear love. He is a gift unspeakable! Heaven cannot match
   Him--how can earth describe Him? When this gift is best expressed, even
   when the Spirit of God helps men to speak upon it, they yet feel it to
   be unspeakable. When men sing like poets, or write like Apostles, they
   acknowledge that the wing of their thought cannot soar to the full
   height of this grand mystery--they have not even expressed what they
   have felt and they have not felt what they inwardly know they ought to
   have felt in connection with so Divine a theme.

   He who before his fellow men has given the most vivid description of
   the love of God in Christ Jesus is the very man who best knows that it
   is inexpressible. You shall not be able to soar among the mysteries and
   bask in the eternal light of Jehovah's face and then come back and say,
   "I can declare it all to you." No, Paul said that, "he heard things
   which it were not lawful for a man to utter." Joys revealed in the
   innermost place of holy fellowship are not to be commonly
   pub-lished--we would mar them in the attempt at their utterance. You
   can often feel what you cannot possibly describe to those who most
   eagerly listen to you. Often my preaching of the love of Christ is, to
   my own mind, when I have done, as sad a failure as if I had gilded gold
   or enameled the lily.

   I was one day in the ruins of Nero's palace and he who guided us there
   had a series of rods fitted in telescopic manner into one another. On
   the top of these was a candle and he held it high up to let us read the
   inscriptions on the arch of the overhead vault. We can do that with
   mortal things and so make men see them, but when we have done our best
   to describe the love of Christ, we have felt as though we had held
   aloft those silly rods with a farthing candle upon them to show the sun
   at noontime! God is very gracious to let His dear Son be seen at all
   through such poor narrow windows as we are. Poor, poor work is our best
   preaching concerning the adorable Lord Jesus! But this is one thing we
   can say with respect to Him from our very hearts--He has filled us to
   the fullest and satisfied us.

   They said of Alexander that he had an ambition so vast that if his body
   had been as large as his soul, he would have stood with one foot on the
   sea and the other on the shore and would have grasped the east with his
   right hand and the west with his left. If our souls were thus boundless
   in desire, Christ's love could fill them! Nothing else contents a man,
   but with Jesus we are satisfied. Though a man were, like Solomon, to
   get to himself all the wisdom and the riches of the world, "Vanity of
   vanities" would be his verdict. But he who wins Christ and has Christ's
   love shed abroad in his heart has no vacant corner in his heart, no
   vacuum within his soul--Christ has filled him to running over. We can
   say, "filled with all the fullness of God," but as to containing the
   fullness of God, he that has the most of it knows how impossible a
   thing it is!

   You may frame the fairest picture that man ever painted, but you cannot
   frame the Alps. Though his daring pencil should cover many a yard, you
   may hang up the master's canvas upon your walls, but when you stand
   upon the mountain's brow and look over hill and vale and sea and shore,
   you dream not of frames and picture galleries, but leave the panorama
   in its own setting, or it cannot be encompassed by human invention. You
   may take the population of a city, a kingdom, or, if necessary, of the
   world and make a census thereof and set down the millions--but who
   shall take a census of the birds of Heaven, the insects which swarm the
   air, the fish which teem the sea, the stars which stud the sky and the
   sands which bound the main? All these things are countable by some sort
   of reckoning, but the love of Christ is Infinite! "Thanks be unto God
   for His unspeakable gift." Thus have we dealt with the unspeakable. And
   we now feel, even more truly than when we began, that language fails
   us.

   II. Let me have all your hearts for a few minutes while I now dwell on
   the other Truth of God, that CHRIST IS A GIFT OF GOD TO BE VERY MUCH
   SPOKEN OF. To be spoken of, first, by thanks to God. "Thanks be unto
   God for His unspeakable gift." Brothers and Sisters, we do not thank as
   we ought for anything. We are not half as thankful as we ought to be.
   Luther was known to tell a story of two cardinals who were riding to
   the council of Constance. One of them stopped because he saw a shepherd
   sitting down in the meadow weeping. Dismounting, he tried to comfort
   him and asked him why he wept. The poor man was slow to answer, but
   being pressed he said, "Looking upon this toad I wept because I have
   never thanked God as I ought for making me a man possessed of reason
   and of excellent form and not a loathsome toad."

   The cardinal was amazed as he saw the piety of the peasant and as he
   went away he exclaimed, "O St. Augustine! How truly did you say the
   unlearned rise and take Heaven by force and we, with all our learning,
   rise not above flesh and blood." Might not some of us faint under a
   like sense of ingratitude? Did you ever bless God for your creation,
   your reason, your continued life? I have known what it is to thank God
   with all my heart for being able to move my limbs and turn in bed.
   Perhaps you have always enjoyed good health--do you thank Him for that?
   To be out of the hospital, to be out of the lunatic asylum, to be out
   of prison, to be out of Hell--do we ever glorify God for these things?
   As for the unspeakable gift of Christ, who among us has ever worthily
   blessed the Lord on this account?

   Brethren, if we have Jesus to be our salvation, when ought we to thank
   God for Him? Why, every morning when we awake! How long should we
   continue to praise God on this account? Till we go to sleep again! From
   the rising of the sun to the going down of the same His name is to be
   extolled. Let us praise God till sleep steeps our senses in a sweet
   forget-fulness. It is even pleasant to go on singing unto the Lord in
   the visions of our bed, as if the chords of grateful emotion vibrated
   after the hands of thought had ceased to play on them. It is good when
   even this wayward fancy of our dreams wanders towards the Well-Beloved,
   never rambling outside of holy ground. Let even the fairies of our
   night-dream sing hymns to Jesus and the cowslip bells of dream-land
   harbor imaginations of the fair plant of renown. Oh, to get into such a
   state that we shall be always praising Him--praising and praising and
   praising and never ceasing!

   When we become low in spirit, it will be a sad reflection if we have to
   acknowledge that in fairer weather we forgot our Beloved. Let us give
   double praise while we can. While we are in good spirits and happy in
   the Lord let us pour forth our hymns. Tamerlane said to the mighty
   Bajazet, when he had overcome him in battle and taken him for a
   prisoner, "Did you ever give God thanks for making you so great an
   emperor?" Bajazet confessed that he had never thought of that. "Then,"
   said Tamerlane, "it is no wonder that so ungrateful a man should be
   made a spectacle of misery." Conscience will taunt us when we are
   sorrowful by saying, "You did not praise God when you were in health
   and now you are ill and hoarse and cannot lift up your voice! You did
   not praise Him for His unspeakable gift when you knew you had it and
   now you are full of doubts about it and Satan has you upon the hip--you
   well deserve all the sorrow that your mind shall feel."

   Therefore, Brothers and Sisters, let us praise the Lord. Let us vow
   today that, His Grace helping us, we will praise Him, praise Him,
   praise Him and praise Him again and again and again and again, as long
   as we have any being, for His unspeakable gift! We shall never get to
   the end of this work--the unspeakable gift is forever telling and
   telling, yet never shall it all be told. Help us, all that know His
   salvation! Help us, angels! Help us, all you coming ages! Help us, all
   you stars of light! But still the thing shall be unspeakable even to
   the end.

   Next, let us show our gratitude to God in deeds of praise. "Thanks be
   unto God for His unspeakable gift." If we cannot speak it, let us try
   to do something that will show forth the praise of God. Actions speak
   more loudly than words.

   If our words have failed, let us try actions. And the first thing to do
   is to give yourself to your Lord. Come, Beloved, if God has given you
   Jesus Christ, give Him yourself! You are not your own, you are bought
   with a price! Why not present your bodies as living sacrifices? Don't
   talk about it, but really do it--live for Him who died for you. Then,
   in consequence of having already given yourself, give of your substance
   to God and give freely. Give not the lame and the blind, but give the
   best of the flock. Let this be a great joy to you--not the payment of a
   tax, but the tribute of delighted love.

   Give to God cheerfully, for He loves a cheerful giver. Buy Him the
   sweet cane with money and fill Him with the fat of your sacrifices.
   Nothing can be too good or great for our ever blessed Lord. Our loving
   Master will accept at our hands the alabaster box when we break it
   joyfully for His dear sake. Let deeds of holy consecration mark the
   whole of our lives, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased, when
   they are not brought as a price to purchase merit, but as a love token
   and tribute to His Grace. Think of this exhortation and carry it out
   abundantly--it shall turn to your temporal and eternal enrichment.

   I am sure, however, that deeds of patience are among the thanks which
   best speak out our gratitude to God. Did it ever strike you that
   patience is a noble sort of Psalmody? Perhaps you will see this truth
   if I tell you an anecdote. In the old church stories we read of one
   called Didymus, a famous preacher who brought many souls to Christ. He
   was blind and Didymus grieved greatly over the loss of his sight. Those
   who heard him perceived that his blindness gave a mournful tinge to his
   discourses. A certain godly man named Alexander went to him and spoke
   to him in private after this fash-ion--"Didymus," he said, "does not
   your blindness cause you great sorrow?" "Brother Alexander," he said,
   "it is my constant grief that I have lost the light. I can scarcely
   endure my existence because I am always in the dark." Then Alexander
   said to him, "You are doing a work which an angel might envy and you
   have the honor of an Apostle in speaking for Jesus Christ and will you
   fret because you have lost that which rats and mice and brute beasts
   have in common with

   men?"

   This was not a very tender thing to say, but it strengthened Didymus
   patiently to endure his trial and to bless God for his unspeakable
   gift. What is there, after all, that we have not, if we have Christ? If
   you have lost everything but Christ, yet if you have Christ left, what
   have you lost? Why fret for pins when God gives pearls? Why grieve over
   the loss of a few pence when God has heaped upon us talents of gold?
   Submit in gracious joy to the Divine will and let your patience say, "I
   will thank God, I will thank God for His unspeakable gift!" Now, dear
   Friends, there is one way in which I want you to thank God and show
   your gratitude for Christ and that is by always holding a thankful
   creed. Believe nothing which would rob God of thanks, or Christ of
   Glory. I set great store by a sound creed in these evil days when the
   Gospel is but little valued by many. Hold a creed of which the top and
   bottom is this, "Grace, Grace, Grace--salvation all of Grace."

   Whenever you hear a preacher, no matter who he may be, making out that
   salvation is not completely of the Grace of God, just say in your
   hearts, "Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift." Do not go an
   inch away from that standpoint. Salvation is altogether a gift--it is
   not of works, it is not of merit--it is of Grace and Grace alone. Turn
   away from the man who stutters when he says "Grace." He will never feed
   your soul. Hold a theology which magnifies Christ, a divinity which
   teaches that Christ is God's unspeakable gift! When a man gets to
   cutting down sin, paring down depravity and making little of future
   punishment, let him no longer preach to you. Some modern Divines
   whittle away the Gospel to the small end of nothing. They make our
   Divine Lord to be a sort of blessed nobody--they bring down salvation
   to mere savability, make certainties into probabilities and treat
   Truths of God as mere opinions.

   When you see a preacher making the Gospel small by degrees and
   miserably less till there is not enough of it left to make soup for a
   sick grasshopper, get you gone! Such diminution and adulteration will
   not do for me--my heart cries, "Thanks be to God for His unspeakable
   gift!" These gentlemen, you know, are highly cultivated and can tell us
   all about it. They have a theology which is suited to their educated
   reason. To them, Divine Grace can be weighed in scales and the
   Atonement in balances--unless, indeed, both are as the drop of a
   bucket--not worthy of being mentioned at all. Every grand Truth of God
   with them is dwarfed and dwindled down into utter insignificance. The
   thought of the 19th century makes men the heirs of apes, while it
   declares their souls to be mortal and their sins to be trifles! Our
   Bibles are made to be mere human records and our hopes are treated as
   childish dreams! These pigmy thinkers shorten all things to their pigmy
   scale.

   As for me, I believe in the colossal! A need deep as Hell and Grace as
   high as Heaven! I believe in a pit that is bottomless and in mercy
   above the heavens! I believe in an Infinite God and an Infinite
   Atonement, infinite love and infinite mercy, an Everlasting Covenant
   ordered in all things and sure, of which the substance and the seal is
   an Infinite Christ. Christ is all! Christ is unspeakable, the
   unspeakable gift of God! Hold to that, or you will not thank God as you
   should. Nor rest in a thoroughly sound creed, but try to bring others
   to accept God's unspeakable gift. You know how the birds stir up each
   other to sing? One bird in a cage will excite its fellow, who looks at
   him and seems to say, "You shall not outstrip me. I will sing with
   you." Then another joins the strain, saying, "I will sing with you,"
   till all the little minstrels quiver with an ecstasy of song and form a
   choir of emulating songsters. Hark how the early morning of the spring
   is rendered musical by the full orchestra of birds!

   One songster begins the tune and the rest hasten to swell the music!
   Let us be like these blessed birds. Let us try to lead our families to
   praise the Lord. Bless the Lord till you set the fashion and others
   bless Him with you! Seek out those who do not know the Lord Jesus
   Christ and tell them "the old, old story of Jesus and His love." Thus,
   if you cannot sing more yourself, nor praise God more yourself, you
   will have increased His praise by bringing in others to sing with you!
   See you to this and let this be, from now on, the motto of your lives.
   Write it over your doors! Emblazon it on the walls of your chambers!
   Let it hang over your bed by night, "THANKS BE UNTO GOD FOR HIS
   UNSPEAKABLE GIFT." O Holy Spirit, write this line of gratitude upon the
   tablets of our hearts. Amen.

Today! Today! Today!

   (No. 1551)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, AUGUST 1, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Today if you will hear His voice, harden not your heart." Psalm
   95:7,8.

   THIS Psalm is a burst of praise. It resounds with the joyful noise of
   hearty thanksgiving unto Jehovah and yet before it closes you hear the
   solemn tones of exhortation to men to hearken to the voice of their
   God. Alas that it should be true, but true it is, that the Canaanite
   still dwells in the midst of Israel! In every gathering of the faithful
   there is a mixture of those who know not the ways of God. When Israel
   came out of Egypt, a mixed multitude came forth with the people of
   God--that mixed multitude did them great damage and often brought them
   under great sin and consequent sorrow, but they were always there. And
   they are always here, too, in the Church and around it, dishonoring us
   by their evil behavior. Not only in the great congregations, but even
   in little gatherings of Believers we meet with the unworthy ones.
   Scarcely are 12 met together without a Judas in the midst of them.

   Thus it comes to pass that in our loudest praises there is always a
   measure of discord and when we have lauded the Most High with our best
   hallelujahs we shall be called upon to listen, in humble silence, to
   His warning voice addressed to the unbelieving and disobedient among
   us. Such characters are here this morning and it is well for us to know
   the fact. It is well for us to examine ourselves, whether we belong to
   this class and whether the words before us may not be addressed to
   ourselves--"If you will hear His voice, harden not your hearts." But
   supposing us to have listened to the Lord and to have found peace like
   a river in consequence, it is well for us to think of those who are
   sitting side by side with us who are living in unbelief, that we may
   bless God the more for distinguishing Grace manifested to ourselves and
   that we may offer our earnest prayers for them all through the service
   that God may bring them to His feet and save them by His Grace.

   In the spirit of hearty love to men's souls I shall try to preach. And
   in that spirit I beg of you to hear the Word of God today. If saints
   are thus moved to pity sinners and to pray for them, the Holy Spirit
   will bless the Word and it will be quick and powerful to search out the
   thoughts of men's hearts and awaken them from their indifference to the
   voice of God. He is a happy minister who, while he preaches, is
   surrounded by a praying people! Joshua in the plain is sure of the
   victory while Moses pleads upon the mountain with God! Borne up by your
   supplications, I advance to an earnest conflict with the hard hearts of
   the unsaved. Yet the sermon will not be altogether and only for the
   unbelieving, for, alas, even in God's people there is a measure of
   unbelief and deafness of ear. Even God's children do not hear their
   Father's voice so readily as they should!

   We are sometimes so taken up with other things that God speaks again
   and again and we do not regard Him. The still small voice of His love
   is too apt to be altogether unheeded while the thunders of this world's
   traffic fill our ears. Take heed, therefore, Brothers and Sisters, lest
   there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the
   living God. Lest this should be the case, let each of us take home to
   himself so much of what shall be spoken as may fairly be applicable to
   himself and let us all hear God saying to us, even to us, "Today if you
   will hear His voice, harden not your heart, as in the provocation."

   Let us come at once to the text. The simple plan of our speaking this
   morning shall at once be laid before you. We have here, first, a time
   specified--the Holy Spirit says, "Today." Secondly, a voice to be
   regarded--"If you will hear His voice." And then, thirdly, an evil to
   be dreaded, against which we are warned--"harden not your heart." There
   is a sad tendency in man to harden his heart even when God speaks and,
   therefore, the Holy Spirit says to us, "Harden not your heart, as in
   the provocation."

   I. First, then, THE TIME SPECIFIED--"Today if you will hear His voice."
   This is the uniform time and tense of the Holy Spirit's exhortations.
   He says nothing about tomorrow, except to forbid our boasting of it,
   since we know not

   what a day shall bring forth. All His instructions are set to the time
   and tune of "Today, today, today." He speaks of pressing and immediate
   necessities requiring to be supplied "today" and of urgent duties which
   must be fulfilled "today." He says, "Consecrate yourselves, today, to
   the Lord." "I command you this thing today." "Son, go work today in my
   vineyard." Therefore, "Today if you will hear His voice, harden not
   your heart." "Today" is a time of obligation. Every man is under a
   present necessity as a subject of God to obey his Lord, today, and
   having rebelled against his God, every sinner is under law to repent of
   sin today!

   "Repent you therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted
   out," is the cry of Scripture to everyone who has sinned against the
   Most High (Acts 3:19). What if I should repent tomorrow, yet it will be
   a sin to remain impenitent today. What if I should believe in Christ
   next year, yet will it be a heinous offense to have been an unbeliever
   this year. I have no more right to continue to disobey than I ever had
   to disobey at all! When the Law of God has been broken, it is still
   binding and every fresh offense against it is reckoned to our charge.
   We are bound to confess and forsake sin now. I met with a striking
   sentence in the works of William Mason which is well worthy to be
   written among your memo-randa--"Every day of delay leaves a day more to
   repent of and a day less to repent in."

   What if this day shall be the last I live? Shall it be spent in
   refusing to hear the Word of my Maker? Shall my last breath be spent in
   rejecting my Savior? God forbid! I see that I am bound as His creature
   to obey Him and as His sinful creature to seek pardon of Him. Help me,
   therefore, Blessed Spirit, to attend to these things this day without
   delay. Remember, also, that today is a time of opportunity. There is,
   this day, set before us an open door of approach to God! This is a very
   favored day, for it is the Lord's Day, the day of rest, consecrated to
   works of Grace. Today our Lord Jesus rose and left the dead that He
   might declare the justification of His people.

   This is a day of good tidings, Beloved! I pray you seize the golden
   moments. On what better day can you seek the Lord than on that day
   which He has hedged about and set apart that you might spend it in His
   love? Is it not our Sabbath? No day can be more fit for ceasing from
   your own works that you may rest in the work of Christ. Is it not the
   first day of the week? This day creating work began--why should not the
   new creation begin in you at this good hour? Today the fiat of the Lord
   went forth and there was light. O for that fiat to be heard within your
   souls that you might have the

   Light of God!

   It is a day of Grace today, a day of Gospel preaching, a day of an open
   Bible! It is a day of promises, a day in which the Spirit of God comes
   to work with men, a day in which Jesus Christ is set forth evidently
   crucified among you! It is a day in which the Mercy Seat is
   approachable, a day in which justice is God's strange work, but in
   which mercy is His joyful occupation! These are days which kings and
   Prophets waited for and saw not--blessed days when Mercy keeps open
   house for all hungry souls and when whoever will, may come and him that
   comes shall in no wise be cast out! You cannot have a better time for
   coming to Christ than the season prescribed in the text--namely,
   "TODAY!" With some of you it is a time of choice opportunity, for you
   are in good health and possess the powers of clear connected thought.

   How much better is such a day than the gloomy period when you will lie
   sick and near to death! That poor brain will be distracted with a
   thousand cares and fears--how will you, then, be able to grasp the
   solemn Truths of Revelation for the first time? It is ill to be setting
   your house in order at the moment you are leaving it! You may have
   enough to do even to draw your breath, while those who watch you will
   need to wipe the clammy sweat from your brow--it will be a poor time
   for these weighty matters then! It may be you will be low, or faint, or
   delirious and it will be hard to be without God then. Many have said to
   me, when I have seen them dying, "If I had a Christ to find now what
   would I do?" Do avail yourselves, dear Hearers, of the time when your
   reason is yet upon its hinges and the windows of your minds can yet
   admit the Light of God. Seek the Lord while yet your health is
   continued to you! The day of strength should not be wasted, nor should
   our youth be thrown away, but while vigor lasts we should press into
   the Kingdom. Today, then, listen, for today is an opportune time!

   Remember, also, that you are sitting in the place where God has saved
   thousands of souls and you are listening to one who, though in himself
   is utterly unworthy, God has used for bringing many to Himself. Perhaps
   you have come from some distant part of the country where the preaching
   has not been a power to your soul. The very change and novelty of the
   minister's voice may be helpful to you and you may, this day, be more
   inclined to attend to the Gospel than you have been on other occasions.
   It is, therefore, a time of opportunity! Hoist sail while the wind
   blows! Men say, "Make hay while the sun shines," and I say the same to
   you! While the rain of Grace is falling, set your souls under the

   sacred shower. He who goes into a battle and wishes to be wounded will
   soon meet with a wound and he who wishes the Truth of God to lay him
   low will not be long untouched by it.

   Everything around seems, today, agreed to help the soul that will, at
   once, come to Jesus! The day, the place, the people, the preacher--all
   make it a time of opportunity to many of you! Remember how Paul tells
   us plainly that it is a time limited. He says "Again He limits a
   certain day, saying in David, today if you will hear His voice." Today
   will not last forever--a day is but a day. When days are longest,
   shadows fall, at last, and night comes on. The longest life soon wanes
   into the evening of old age and old age hastens to the sunset of the
   tomb. It is a limited day! A day, but only a day. How very limited life
   is in many instances! How many are born but never reach complete
   manhood! How many pass away before they have fulfilled one half the
   allotted age of man! How many lives are extinguished as a candle is
   suddenly blown out. This thought ought to make us listen to the Divine
   voice which cries--"Today!" "Today!"

   The thought of death has often brought men to decision. They tell us in
   the old histories that Peter Waldo, a certain eminent merchant, had
   lived a thoughtless, careless life, but as he walked the streets of
   Lyons, his friend, who was apparently in good health, fell dead at his
   side and Waldo at once sought the Lord, believed the Gospel and
   preached it to others. According to certain writers he became the
   founder of that wonderful people, the Waldensians, who maintained the
   Truth of God through many a century when the whole earth was covered
   with Papal darkness. Oh that some of you would become so conscious of
   your own frailty as to perceive that you are standing on the brink of
   everlasting woe--and thus may you be moved to seek your God at once and
   find your Savior today.

   Reflections upon death have often driven men to Christ and so have
   worked life in them by the blessing of the Holy Spirit. In a book
   entitled, "Wonders of Grace," by a Primitive Methodist minister, I met
   with a story which pleased me much. A young man in Berlin who was sick
   with fever was attended lovingly by a young doctor who was his bosom
   friend. He lived in apartments. His careful friend ordered him to be
   moved into the darkest part of the room, because the sunlight was too
   much for his eyes. It was an amazing Providence that the bed should be
   pushed close against the wall which was only a thin partition
   separating the apartment from the room in which lived the landlord of
   the house.

   While the sick man lay there, possibly with his mind somewhat wandering
   in the fever, he was astonished to hear a voice whisper in his own
   tongue a verse which may be translated thus--

   "Today you live, yet Today turn you to God, For before tomorrow comes
   You may be with the dead."

   Some other words followed which he did not hear so well, but presently
   in a louder voice he heard the words repeated--

   "Today you live, yet Today turn you to God, For before tomorrow comes
   You may be with the dead."

   Over and over again those same words were whispered or spoken close to
   the spot where he was lying. It so impressed him that when his young
   friend, the physician, asked him how he was, he looked at him earnestly
   and replied--

   "Today you live, yet

   Today turn you to God,

   For before tomorrow comes

   You may be with the dead."

   The physician took his hand and said, "Your pulse is better, but if it
   were not for that I should think you worse, for you are evidently
   raving." To this he received no answer but a repetition of the lines.
   He could get nothing out of his patient but that verse, spoken with an
   awe-struck look and thrilling voice. The young physician went home
   thoughtful and when he came next time he found his friend much better,
   sitting up in bed, reading the Scriptures. The two sought and found the
   Savior, for those warning words had drawn them across the boundary line
   and made them decide for God and for His

   Christ!

   How came the lines to have thus sounded in the sick man's ears? Was it
   a dream? Did an angel pronounce the warning? No, it was a little boy
   who had failed to repeat his lesson to his father and had been made to
   stand in the corner, with his face to the wall, till he knew the lines.
   He was saying his task over and over and over to himself, in order to
   fix it

   on his memory and God was using his voice through the partition to
   bring a heart to Himself! How various are the methods of mercy! Dear
   Hearer, there may be something quite as odd and yet as ordinary about
   your being here this morning--some simple circumstance may have
   stranded you on these shores--where Divine Love waits to bless you. You
   are not in the place where you usually attend--perhaps you thought it
   too far to go on such a wet day and you have turned in to worship
   nearer home--may God overrule it for your eternal good!

   May the Lord impress you with the fact that the day of Grace is
   limited! Mark well the Truth of God that today is the only time that
   any man has and, therefore, he had need be up and doing--

   "Our time is all today, today, The same, though changed and while it
   flies, With still small voice the moments say, 'Today, today, be wise,
   be wise!'" A word, however, of encouragement before we leave this
   point--it is a time of promise, for when God says to a man, Come to Me
   at such a time, He, by that very word makes an engagement to meet him!
   One asked me this morning, "When can I call upon you?" I said, "At ten
   o'clock next Tuesday." Of course I shall then be ready to receive him
   if nothing unforeseen prevents. I should not have made the appointment
   for him to come if I had meant to refuse him when he comes! And when
   God says, "Hear My voice today," He means that He will meet you and
   speak with you today!

   David said to Solomon, "If you seek Him, He will be found of you." This
   is true of you, dear Hearer, if you will seek Him today. He has made no
   appointment with you to meet with you tomorrow, but He has engaged to
   speak with you today, if you will hear His voice. Never shall one wait
   and say, like young Samuel, "Speak, Lord, for Your servant hears,"
   without God's speaking in words of love before long. There is so much
   to encourage in the text that I would gladly hope and pray that many of
   my dear hearers who have never sought the Lord will, at this moment,
   cry, "The time past shall suffice me to have worked the will of the
   flesh and now today let others do as they will, as for me and my house
   we will serve the Lord and seek His face."

   II. Secondly, let us think of THE VOICE TO BE REGARDED. "Today if you
   will hear His voice." Place the emphasis upon the word HIS. Reading the
   Psalm, as we have done, we could not help noticing that its first
   verses are the voice of the Church of God--"O come, let us sing unto
   the Lord: let us make a joyful noise to the Rock of our salvation. Let
   us come before His Presence with thanksgiving and make a joyful noise
   unto Him with Psalms." Throughout the first seven verses we have the
   voice of God's people pleading with all that are mingled with them to
   bow in joyful, humble, believing worship before the Most High. Shall
   not these pleas influence our minds? Surely attention should be paid to
   the voices of godly men and women!

   The entreaties of pious parents, teachers, relatives and friends ought
   not to fall to the ground. When the bride says "Come," her voice is
   worthy of your attention, especially when you remember that the Spirit
   speaks in her. We, who serve God, implore you to have regard to our
   entreaties. When we unselfishly love you as we love our own souls and
   long for your salvation, you ought to regard our earnestness. When you
   know that our hearts break at the thought of your being lost and that
   we would give our eyes if we might but give eyes to you which with you
   should see Jesus, there ought to be some power about our love and you
   should give earnest heed to our entreaties! I thank God there often is
   a force in the love of Believers to their friends, but if in our case
   there is none, if you think our appeals too insignificant, yet I
   beseech you listen to the voice of God, for surely His voice may not be
   slighted!

   Today hear His voice, for, indeed, the Gospel is His voice! Is not the
   Bible His book? Are not the Truths which we preach, Truths of God which
   He has revealed? Is not the plan of salvation of His own ordaining? Is
   not Christ the unspeakable gift of His own giving? Is not pardon
   according to His promise? Therefore, though the preacher will be quite
   willing that you should pour contempt upon him, he implores you not to
   do despite to his Master. Despise not God! Reject not Christ! "Today if
   you will hear His voice, harden not your heart." Remember that the
   voice of God is the voice of authority. God has a right to speak to
   you--shall the creature refuse to hear the Creator? Shall those who are
   nourished and fed by Him turn a deaf ear to the Preserver of men? When
   He says, "today," who among us shall dare to say that he will not
   listen today, but by-and-by?

   It is disobedience on the part of a child when he says to his father "I
   will not obey you today." He might as well say "I will disobey you,"
   for that is what he means. If you had a summons from the court to
   attend at such an hour, would you send a message to say that it was not
   convenient, but you would attend at your own pleasure? If the Queen
   were to

   command you into her presence at such an hour, I guarantee that you
   would be there before the time rather than after it! It is an insult to
   superiors when we take no notice of their appointed times, but keep
   them waiting our will and pleasure. The Lord has a right to fix His own
   time for doing deeds of Grace and favor. He is giving away His free
   mercy to undeserving subjects and if He says, "I will open the gates
   today and I will answer prayer today," it would be the height of
   impertinence if we reply, "You must wait my time. Go Your way. When I
   have a more convenient season I will send for

   You."

   Is God to wait as a lackey upon you? You deserve His wrath--will you
   slight His love? He speaks in amazing tenderness--will you exhibit
   astounding hardness? Be not so daring, so profane, so cruel as to talk
   of delay when the Divine message lays such stress on your immediate
   attention, saying, "Today if you will hear His voice." If this strain
   should not affect the conscience, let me try another. The voice here
   spoken of is the voice of Love. How wooing are its tones! The Lord in
   Holy Scripture speaks of mercy and of pardon bought with blood--the
   blood of His dear Son! O Man, He calls you to Him, not that He may slay
   you, but that He may save you! He does not summon you to a prison, but
   He invites you to a banquet! God speaks not as judge, but as father!
   Not as from Sinai, but from Calvary--"Come, now, and let us reason
   together, says the Lord; though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be
   as white as snow." "Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy
   laden and I will give you rest."

   Do not be cruel to almighty Love! Be not ungenerous to eternal pity!
   When the Holy Spirit says, "Today if you will hear His voice," oh, I
   pray you, hear, and your soul shall live and He will make an
   Everlasting Covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David!
   Personally, I can resist harshness, but love subdues me. I hope that
   you are cast in even a softer mold than I am. Even human love is hard
   to resist, but, oh, the love of God, who can withstand it? Base is the
   spirit that can harden itself against the boundless love of God in
   Christ Jesus! Remember, too, that this is the voice ofpower. This is a
   sweet thought for those of you who are without strength. You will,
   perhaps, say, "I cannot turn to God," but He can turn you! You lament
   that you cannot feel as you would wish--He can give you every gracious
   feeling!

   God's voice, alone, created the world! He spoke the universe out of
   nothing and when darkness enwrapped it, He said, "Light be," and light
   was! He who spoke thus in Nature can thus speak in Grace and work
   salvation in you. The text warns you against hardening your heart and
   if you will listen to the voice of God it will soften your heart. "His
   voice breaks the cedars of Lebanon; His voice makes the hinds to
   calve." So can His voice break your hard heart and cause your
   hesitating spirit to decide. Only yield to it! Yield to it now! The day
   may come when you will never hear it again. It is a pitiful story I
   once heard told of an old man sitting alone with his little grandchild.
   Taking the little child on his knee, he said, "My boy, seek the Lord
   betimes; seek Him now."

   "Grandpa," he said, "have you sought Him?" "No, child," he said, "no."
   "But, Grandpa, should you not seek Him?" The old man shook his head and
   sadly answered, "I would, child, but my heart is hard. My heart is
   hard. There was a time"--and then the old man wept. Oh, if such an old
   man is here, I say to him, there was a time and there is a time, for
   even now, though your heart is hard, is there not the promise, "I will
   take away the heart of stone out of their flesh and I will give them a
   heart of flesh"? Old Man, the Holy Spirit says still, "Today, today,"
   and He that says, "today" can make today for you a day of tenderness
   and melting till you will be no longer like a stone! How often have I
   felt the power of that verse--

   "Your mercy is more than a match for my heart,

   Which wonders to feel its own hardness depart;

   Dissolved by Your goodness, I fall to the ground,

   And weep to the praise of the mercy I've found." The Lord put that new
   song into all your mouths!

   The voice of God, let me add, now, to close this point, ought to be
   heard because it is a pledging voice. God, by calling you, pledges
   Himself that He will hear you if you come. When He says to you, "Turn
   you, turn you, why will you die?" He pledges Himself that you shall not
   die if you turn to Him. When He says, "Seek you the Lord while He may
   be found," He does, as it were, covenant that He will be found of you.
   Listen, then, to His promising voice, His cheering voice! It will cast
   all unbelieving fear out of you and drive away Satan better than
   David's harp drove the evil spirit out of Saul. God help you to do so.
   The voice of God should be easy to hear, for "the voice of the Lord is
   powerful, the voice of the Lord is full of majesty. The voice of the
   Lord shakes the wilderness. The Lord of Glory thunders."

   All Nature bows before the roll of His voice. Full often during this
   week, above the roar of the sea, or the clamor of traffic in the
   street, peal on peal of the voice of God was heard till the mountains
   trembled to their foundations and the heavens were astonished. What
   deafness must sin have caused to man that he cannot hear the voice of
   God! Oh, be willing to let that voice penetrate your hearts--it will do
   so if you are but willing that it should. May God work in you to will
   of His good pleasure. I fear that some of you are so very busy that you
   will not reserve your ears for God even for half an hour. You are too
   much taken up with the discord of the world to heed the harmony of
   Heaven.

   Diodorus Siculus says that in Sicily the herbs are sometimes so
   odoriferous and in certain places there are such thick beds of them,
   that when hounds pass through them they lose the scent. I fear that in
   some men's lives there are so many vanities, so much love of the world,
   so many poisonous flowers, in fact, that they lose scent of things
   eternal, if they ever had any. Yet what will it profit you if you gain
   the world and lose your souls? You will not gain the world in business
   in these dull times, profits are small now--you will not gain a world,
   will you? No, nor half a world, nor even a moderate fortune. But
   whatever your gain is, look at it and judge if it is not a poor
   compensation for a lost Heaven, a lost eternity, a lost soul. If you
   lose your soul you have lost all!

   A bankrupt may begin again if it is but bankruptcy of this world's
   goods, but what can he do who is bankrupt for eternity and can never
   start anew? Oh, you that never think of this, if you never have another
   warning, let this come home to you! You must die, Sirs! You must leave
   your moneys and properties, your shops and your warehouses. You of
   smaller estate must leave your cozy cottage or your comfortable room
   and all the little treasures of home! And what will your naked spirit
   do if it has no resting place beyond the skies? Must it flit forever
   over a shoreless deluge of woe and find no rest for the sole of its
   feet?

   Hearken and consider. "Today if you will hear His voice, harden not
   your heart." Thus says the Lord, "Incline your ear and come unto Me;
   hear and your soul shall live." May the Lord bless you, now, and may
   His Spirit lead you to hear, to believe, to obey.

   III. Now comes our third point and as time presses we must speak in
   condensed words of THE EVIL TO BE DREADED. "Harden not your
   hearts"--there is really no need--they are hard enough already. "Harden
   not your hearts"--there is no excuse, for why should you resist love?
   "Harden not your hearts"--there can be no good in it--a man is less a
   man in proportion to his loss of tenderness of heart. Sensibility is,
   in many aspects, a high possession. Sensibility of the affections and
   the heart is rather to be cultivated than lessened, for it may turn out
   to be the beginning of Grace. "Harden not your hearts"--you cannot
   soften them, but you can harden them!

   There is an awful power for evil about every man. Do not try how far it
   will carry you. To do good, man needs the help of Grace, but to do evil
   he needs no aid and if he did, the devil is there to lend it to him
   right speedily. "Harden not your hearts," for this will be your
   ruin--it is the suicide of your soul, for first, it will be a serious
   evil if you do. To harden the heart in this case is to harden it
   against God. The voice is that of the Lord of Hosts. Be astonished, O
   heavens! God is speaking in boundless Grace and the man is hardening
   his heart in the Presence of God! Under the sound of Love's entreaties.
   Within earshot of Mercy's imploring tones, the sinner is hardening his
   heart! Sad work, to harden one's heart against one's own welfare! Shall
   any man do this and go unpunished? What do you think?

   He hardens his heart willfully. He feels some drawings to good things
   and he pulls back. Grace leads and the man stands aside with resolve
   not to follow. Have you ever done that, my Hearer? Did you ever say,
   "It will not do," and put down the rising emotion? Did you ever, when
   reading a good book, or at a deathbed side, or when hearing an earnest
   sermon, do violence to your better self? Take care, take care! They
   will be lost, indeed, who of set purpose wander from the right path! O
   do not perish out of spite to love. Some have resisted conscience
   frequently--they find it hard to go to Hell and yet they push on.

   Many of the more dissolute kind slide downward from vice to vice! They
   perform a horrible descent, as down a mountain of ice--they give
   themselves up to iniquity and away they go to Hell! Woe unto such!
   Others of us have been highly favored, for across our way God has, as
   it were, cast felled trees and iron chains to stop our downward career.
   If you do get lost, some of you will have to wade through your mother's
   tears and leap over your father's prayers and your minister's
   entreaties. You will have to force a passage through the warnings of
   godly people and the examples of pious relatives. Why this effort to
   destroy your own souls? Why so desperately set on self-destruction? It
   must be a gigantic evil for a man to do this and continue to do it.

   Will you do it again this morning? Are you resolved to be lost? If so,
   then there is one thing I would like you to do and that is to put it in
   writing. I would, daring as it seems, challenge you to write out your
   covenant with Hell! I would have you look yourself in the face and say,
   "I have surrendered myself to a life of sin and I am resolved to take
   the consequences and to die an enemy to God." If you will put that in
   black and white I feel persuaded you will stand back from it and say,
   "It must not be." But you answer, "No, I could not write it." Then why
   do it? Perhaps this morning one more obstinate fit will end all our
   hope of you. One more holding of conscience by the throat until it
   turns black in the face with your grip may be the final action that
   shall decide your future and you will never be troubled again by
   compunction or conviction. Ah me, if it should come to this--that you
   will, from now on, glide down, without a jerk, into the bottomless pit!
   God forbid it! Oh Almighty Spirit, suffer it not to be so with any
   here!

   To harden the heart is a great evil. And it is a greater sin, let me
   say next, in some than in others, for the Scripture quotes the instance
   of Israel. The Holy Spirit says, "As in the provocation, when your
   fathers tempted Me and saw My works 40 years." Some of you are the
   highly privileged as compared with others. Look at the multitudes that
   live in our back streets and courts and alleys who never heard the
   Gospel, were never trained to go to the House of Prayer and who live
   and die ignorant of it! How much better your lot! Many of you cannot
   remember when you first came to a place of worship. You were brought
   here when you were children. You know the Gospel thoroughly, though you
   know it not in your hearts--what guilt must be yours to sin against
   such Light of God and such special advantages!

   Some of you have often been warned. You have frequently twisted about
   on those seats most uneasily. You have gone home and you could not eat.
   You have felt you must turn, but you have not done so! You are as
   careless as ever. "He that being often reproved hardens his neck, shall
   suddenly be destroyed and that without remedy." Certain of you have
   also been chastened--you have had a great deal of trouble--you have
   lost your dearest friend, or you have been sick and been forced to look
   into eternity and see how dark it is. On your weary bed you moaned in
   spirit--

   "Dark is all the world before me, Darker, yet, eternity."

   Yet affliction has had no good effect upon you. "Why should you be
   stricken any more? You will revolt more and more." Already you are as
   ill as you can be! The whole head is sick with sorrow and the whole
   heart faint with grief! You have bruises and sores as the result of
   God's chastening. Will you revolt more and more? Will you still offend?

   Yes, and on the other hand, some of you have been greatly indulged by
   God--you have all that heart could wish. He has prospered you in
   business beyond your expectation. He has made you happy in your wife
   and in your children. He has set a hedge about you and all that you
   have and yet you are not His. Oh, how can you stand out against Love
   when she multiplies her favors? I pray and beseech you, by the love of
   our dear God, treat Him not so ill, but confess your fault and seek His
   face! I know some, too, who have had hard struggles of conscience and
   are having them now. Which way they will turn I know not. May God cast
   the weight of time into the scale and decide them for Heaven! Perhaps I
   am even speaking to some who have made a profession of religion but do
   not really know the power of it in their own hearts. They are acting
   very inconsistently with it and doing much to dishonor the name of
   Christ. They made vows in Baptism wherein they declared that they were
   buried with Christ--let them hear His voice and hearken to Him before
   the day of Grace shall close!

   I must beg your further attention a minute while I say that this great
   sin, this dreadful sin, can be committed in a great many ways. Only one
   thing can soften the heart and that is the blood of Christ applied by
   the Holy Spirit--but 50 things can harden the heart! I shall tell you
   what others do, but I beseech you not to emulate them--"Harden not your
   hearts." Some harden their hearts by a resolution not to feel--they set
   their faces like flints and resolve to shake off the Word of God. I
   remember preaching, once, when my host disappeared about the middle of
   the sermon and I noticed that a friend who had traveled there with me
   disappeared, too. Afterwards I found out the reason. I said, "What made
   So-and-So go out?" He said, "I guessed what it was and I went after him
   and he said to me, 'Mr. Spurgeon handles me like a piece of India
   rubber and shapes me as he likes. If I stay in there I shall be
   converted and that will never do and, therefore, I slipped out.'"

   Ah me, many fly from their best Friend! While they are plastic they are
   afraid of being cast into the right mold! Some of you are very much
   like plaster of Paris, or other cement which will take any shape while
   it is soft, but oh, how quick it sets and there is no altering it! If
   you are somewhat affected this morning, do not resist the feeling, but
   give the full assent

   and consent of your heart to it. Who knows, you may now be saved!
   Perhaps if you are not molded while I am preaching, on the way home the
   plaster will set, hard as a rock, and your shape will be fixed for
   eternity! Many harden their hearts by delay, by not yielding today, by
   wishing to wait. Hundreds harden their hearts by pretended doubts, by
   making foolish criticisms and caviling remarks. They talk about the
   speaker's mode of utterance and they get their conscience quiet by
   remembering a false pronunciation or an ungrammatical sentence! Or else
   they say, "We cannot be sure of it; Professor Wiseman says
   differently."

   Ah, yes. But if infidel professors are cast into Hell, their learned
   observations will not comfort you when you perish in their company!
   Look to your own souls and let the professors see to theirs. Some of
   these literary and scientific men will have a great deal to answer
   for--they gain their eminence by daring to say presumptuous words which
   better men tremble to hear--but unbelieving souls welcome their
   wickedness. I have small respect for these advocates of Satan, these
   decoys of the Destroyer. I charge you, do not pretend to be unbelievers
   if you are not, nor invent doubts for the mere sake of pacifying your
   consciences! Too many silence their consciences by getting into evil
   company and by running into silly amusements, all intended to kill time
   and prevent thought upon Divine things.

   A number of people harden their hearts by indulging a favorite sin.
   There is a man here who knows the Gospel well and I thought that he was
   saved, but he loves the intoxicating cup. He drinks every now and then
   till he is drunk and that one sin is destroying him, though in other
   respects he is a fine fellow. As sure as he lives, he will commit that
   folly once too often and perish miserably. When he is sober, he knows
   his wickedness as well as any man and even weeps over it. But I give
   very little for his tears, now, since they have flowed so many times
   that we cannot believe in their sincerity. His repentance dries as soon
   as his handkerchief. Oh that God would create sincerity in him and make
   his heart weep instead of his eyes! Darling sins are sure destroyers.
   We must give up sin, or give up hope of Heaven.

   John Bunyan, in his, "Holy War," describes "Sweet-Sin Hold" as a
   favorite fortress of Satan, which long held out against Prince
   Immanuel. Oh that we could raze it to the ground! My Hearer, will you
   have your sin and go to Hell, or will you leave your sin and go to
   Heaven? You can not take sin with you into God's rest, neither can you
   be Satan's darling and God's favorite! Grace will not permit any sin to
   be loved. He who loves sin, hates God. I cannot go into further detail,
   but, oh, how many things may be used to harden the heart! This sin will
   bring with it the most fearful consequences. Harden not your heart, for
   by such conduct the last opportunity of entering into the Divine rest
   may pass away. "He swore in His wrath, They shall not enter into My
   rest!"

   You wish to rest at last. You long to rest even now. But it cannot be
   till you yield to God. You are not at peace, now, and you never will be
   if you harden your hearts. God is gently drawing some of you this
   morning. I can feel that He is doing so. I have deep sympathy with you.
   I know how you are feeling--you want to get alone and fall down on your
   knees to pray. Pray now! Cry, "God be merciful to me a sinner," in the
   pew, at once! You do not need to wait to get home. May God the Holy
   Spirit lead you to yield your heart to Jesus Christ at this very time,
   for, if not, there will surely come, one of these days, a last time in
   which you will feel and you will, after that, be given up to a
   conscience seared as with a hot iron, never to feel again!

   Think in what plight you will be when you come to die without Christ!
   How would you like to die like Queen Elizabeth, of whom history tells
   us that she would not go to bed--she would have cushions on the
   floor--for if she went to bed she would die and she could not bear the
   thought! This was her frequent cry, "Call time again! Call time again!
   Call time again! A world of wealth for an inch of time! Call time
   again!" Her majesty, whom you have seen decked out with all her ruffles
   and silks and the like, all haggard and in dishabille upon the ground,
   shrieked out, "Call time again! A world of wealth for an inch

   of time!"

   May God grant that such may never be your lot, for if you so die--there
   is a something after death still more awful! I will say but little on
   that alarming theme, but put it in one verse as I learned it when a
   child and as I believed it after many an anxious thought. Hear the
   Truth of God, tremble and turn unto the Lord!--

   "There is a dreadful Hell,

   And everlasting pains,

   Where sinners must with devils dwell

   In darkness, fire and chains."

   Escape for your life! Today if you will hear His voice, harden not your
   heart!

The Friends Of Jesus

   (No. 1552)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, AUGUST 8, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "You are My friends if you do whatever I command you." John 15:14.

   OUR Lord Jesus Christ is beyond all comparison the best of friends--a
   friend in need, a friend indeed. "Friend!" said Socrates, "there is no
   friend!" But Socrates did not know our Lord Jesus, or he would have
   added, "except the Savior." In the heart of our Lord Jesus there burns
   such friendship towards us that all other forms of it are as dim
   candles to the sun. "Greater love has no man than this, that he lay
   down his life for his friend." An ordinary man has gone as far as he
   can when he has died for his friend and yet he would have died anyway,
   so that in dying for his friend he does but pay, somewhat beforehand, a
   debt which must inevitably be discharged a little further on. With
   Christ there was no necessity to die at all and this, therefore, places
   His love and His friendship by itself.

   He died who needed not to die and died in agony when He might have
   lived in Glory--never did man give such proof of friendship as this!
   Let the friendship of our Lord to us stand as the model of our
   friendship to Him. It cannot be so in all respects because our
   situations and conditions are different. His must always be the love of
   the greater to the less, the love of the Benefactor to one in need, the
   love of the Redeemer to those who are bought with a price but, setting
   those points aside, the whole tone and spirit of our Lord's friendship
   are such that the more closely we can imitate it the better. Such
   friendship as His should be reflected in a friendship most hearty and
   self-sacrificing on our part.

   Our Lord does not, I think, in this text speak to us about His being
   our friend, but about our being His friends. He is "the friend of
   sinners," but sinners are not His friends till their hearts are
   changed. "You are My friends if you do whatever I command you"--we are
   not His friends till then. His love to us is entirely of Himself, but
   friendship needs something from us. Friendship cannot be all on one
   side--one-sided friendship is more fitly called mercy, grace, or
   benevolence--friendship in its full sense is mutual. You may do all you
   will for a man and be perfectly benevolent and yet he may make you no
   return--friendship can only exist where there is a response.

   Therefore we have not before us the question as to whether Christ loves
   us or not, as to whether Christ has pity on us or not, for in another
   part of Scripture we read of "His great love wherewith He loved us even
   when we were dead in trespasses and sins." He befriended us when we
   were enemies, but that is not our subject just now--the question is
   about our being friends to Him and such we must be made if, indeed,
   there is to be any intimacy of mutual friendship. Friendship cannot be,
   as I have said before, all on one side. It is like a pair of
   scales--there must be something to balance on the other side--there
   must be a return of kindly feeling from the person loved.

   Jesus tells us here that if we are to be His friends, we must do
   whatever He commands us and that out of love to Him. Beloved, it is the
   highest honor in the world to be called the friend of Christ. There is
   surely no title that excels in dignity that which was worn by Abraham,
   who was called, "The friend of God." Lord Brooke was so delighted with
   the friendship of Sir Philip Sydney that he ordered to be engraved upon
   his tomb nothing but this--"Here lies the friend of Sir Philip Sydney."
   There is beauty in such a feeling, but yet it is a small matter
   compared with being able to say, "Here lives a friend of Christ!"

   O wondrous condescension that He should call me, "Friend"! If I am,
   indeed, a true Believer, not only is He my friend, without which I
   could have no hope here or hereafter, but He has, in the abounding of
   His Grace, been pleased to regard me as His friend and write me down in
   the honored list of intimates who are permitted to speak familiarly
   with Him--as those do between whom there are no secrets, for their
   hearts are revealed to Him while He hides nothing from them, but says,
   "If it were not so I would have told you."

   Beloved, in what a light this sets obedience to Christ's commandments!
   I cannot help, at this early moment in the sermon, noting how the
   doctrine of our text transfigures obedience and makes it the joy and
   glory of life! How precious

   it is, for it is a better seal to friendship than the possession of the
   largest gifts and influence. Christ does not say, "You are My friends
   if you rise to a position of respectability among men, or honor in the
   Church." No, however poor you may be and those to whom He spoke these
   words were very poor, He says, "You are My friends if you do whatever I
   command you." Obedience is better than wealth and better than rank!
   Jesus values His friends, not by what they have, or what they wear, but
   by what they do.

   The 11 Apostles we may put down as having remarkable qualifications for
   their lifework, yet their Lord does not say, "You are My friends
   because I have endowed you with abilities for the Apostleship." Even to
   these leaders of His sacramental host Jesus says plainly, "You are My
   friends if you do whatever I command you." That is the point by which
   your friendship shall be tested--"If you are obedient you are My
   Friends." He says neither less nor more to any of us who, this day,
   aspire to the high dignity of being contained within the circle of His
   personal friends. You must, my Brothers and Sisters, yield obedience to
   your Master and Lord and be eager to do it, or you are not His bosom
   friends.

   This is the one essential which Grace, alone, can give us. Do we rebel
   against the request? Far from it! Our joy and delight lie in bearing
   our Beloved's easy yoke.

   I. Let us come to the subject more closely and notice first, that OUR
   LORD HIMSELF TELLS US WHAT OBEDIENCE HE REQUESTS from those who call
   themselves His friends. True friends are eager to know what they can do
   to please the objects of their love. Let us gladly listen to what our
   adorable Lord now speaks to the select circle of His chosen. He asks of
   one and all obedience. None of us are exempted from doing His
   commandments. However lofty or however lowly our condition, we must
   obey. If our talent is but one, we must obey and if we have 10, still
   we must obey. There can be no friendship with Christ unless we are
   willing, each one, to yield Him hearty, loyal service.

   Let it go round, then, to all of you upon whom the name of Jesus Christ
   is named--if enrolled among the friends of Jesus, you must be careful
   about your own personal obedience to His blessed will. Forget not that
   even to the queen, standing on His right in gold of Ophir, the word is
   given, "He is your Lord and worship you Him." It must be active
   obedience, notice that. "You are My friends, if you do whatever I
   command you." Some think it is quite sufficient if they avoid what He
   forbids. Abstinence from evil is a great part of righteousness, but it
   is not enough for friendship. If a man can say, "I am not a drunk, I am
   not dishonest, I am not unchaste, I am not a violator of the Sabbath, I
   am not a liar," so far so good--but such righteousness does not exceed
   that of the scribes and Pharisees--and they cannot enter the kingdom of
   God!

   It is well if you do not willfully transgress, but if you are to be
   Christ's friends there must be far more than that. It would be a poor
   friendship with your Master which only said, "I am Your friend and to
   prove it, I don't insult You, I don't rob You, I don't speak evil of
   You." Surely there must be more positive evidence to certify
   friendship! The Lord Jesus Christ lays great stress upon positive
   duties. It is, "if you do whatever I command you." At the Last Day He
   will say, "I was hungry and you gave me meat: I was thirsty and you
   gave me drink." In that memorable 25th chapter of Matthew nothing is
   said about negative virtues--only positive actions are cited and dwelt
   upon in detail.

   You know it is an old English saying, "He is my friend who grinds at my
   mill." That is to say, friendship shows itself in doing helpful acts
   which prove sincerity. Fine words are mere wind and go for nothing if
   not backed up with substantial deeds of kindness. Friendship cannot
   live on windy talk, it needs the bread of matter of fact. The Inspired
   Word says, "Show Me a proof of your love; show it by doing whatever I
   command you." We are clear, from the wording of the text, that the
   obedience Christ expects from us is continuous. He does not say, "If
   you sometimes do what I command you--if you do it on Sundays, for
   instance--if you do what I command you in your place of worship, that
   will suffice. No, we are to abide in Him and keep His statutes even
   unto the end.

   I am not now preaching works as the way of salvation but as the
   evidences offellowship, which is quite another thing. We must seek in
   every place, at all times and under all circumstances to do as Jesus
   bids us out of a cheerful spirit of reverence to Him. Such tender,
   loving subjection as a godly wife gives to her husband must be gladly
   yielded by us throughout life if we are His friends. This obedience
   must also be universal. "You are My friends if you do whatever I
   command you." No sooner is anything discovered to be the subject of a
   command than the man who is a true friend of Christ says, "I will do
   it," and he does it. He does not pick and choose which precept he will
   keep and which he will neglect, for this is self-will and not
   obedience.

   I have known some professors err greatly in this matter. They have been
   very strict over one point and they have blamed everybody who did not
   come up to their strictness, talking as if that one duty fulfilled the
   whole Law of God! Straining at gnats has been a very leading business
   with many. They have bought a choice assortment of strainers of the
   very finest net to get out all the gnats from their cup, but at the
   same time, on another day they have opened their mouths and swallowed a
   camel without a qualm. This will not do! The test is, "If you do
   whatever I command you." I do not mean that little things are
   unimportant--far from it. If there is a gnat that Christ bids you
   strain, strain it out with great diligence--do not let a midge escape
   you if He bids you remove it.

   The smallest command of Christ may often be the most important and I
   will tell you why. Some things are great, evidently great and, for many
   reasons even a hypocritical professor will attend to them. But the test
   may lie in the minor points, which hypocrites do not take the trouble
   to notice, since no human tongue would praise them for doing them. Here
   is the proof of your love. Will you do the smaller thing for Jesus as
   well as the more weighty matter? Too many say, "I do not see any use in
   it. I can be saved without it. There are a great many different
   opinions on the point," and so on. All this comes of evil and is not
   consistent with the spirit of friendship with Christ, for love pleases,
   even in trifles.

   Is it Christ's will? Is it plainly a precept of His Word? Then it is
   not yours to reason why, nor to raise any question. The reality of your
   subjection to your Lord and Master may hinge upon those seemingly
   insignificant points. A domestic servant might place the breakfast on
   the table and feel that she had done her duty, but if her mistress told
   her to place the salt at the corner and she did not, she would be asked
   the cause of her neglect. Suppose she replied to her mistress, "I did
   not think it necessary. I placed the breakfast before you, but a little
   salt was too trifling a matter for me to troubled about." Her mistress
   might answer, "But I told you to be sure and put out the saltcellar.
   Mind you, do so tomorrow."

   Next morning there is no salt and the maid says she did not see the
   need of setting it on the table. Her mistress is displeased and tells
   her that her wish must be carried out. Will she not be a very foolish
   and vexatious girl if she refuses to do so because she does not see the
   need of it? I think it is likely that the young woman would have to
   find other employment before long, for such conduct is very annoying.
   So it is with those professors who say, "I have attended to the main
   things and what I neglect is quite a minor matter." Such are not even
   good servants and they can never be friends! I beseech you, dear
   Brothers and Sisters, labor after universal obedience. "Whatever He
   says to you, do it." Only by an earnest endeavor to carry out the whole
   of His will can you live in happy fellowship with Him and be, indeed,
   His friends.

   Note well that this obedience is to be rendered as to Christ Himself.
   Put the emphasis on the little word, I--"You are My friends if you do
   whatever I command you." We are to do these things because Jesus
   commands them. Does not the royal Person of our Lord cast a very strong
   light upon the necessity of obedience? When we refuse to obey, we
   refuse to do what the Lord, Himself, commands! When the Lord Jesus
   Christ, the Son of God and our Redeemer, is denied obedience, it is
   treason! How can rebels against the King be His Majesty's friends? The
   precepts of Scripture are not the commandments of man nor the
   ordinances of angels, but the Laws of Christ and how dare we despise
   them! We are to act rightly because Jesus commands us and we love to do
   His pleasure--there can be no friendship without this. Oh for Grace to
   serve the Lord with gladness!

   To close this first point, it appears that our Lord would have us obey
   Him out of a friendly spirit. Obedience to Christ as if we were forced
   to do it under pains and penalties would be of no worth as a proof of
   friendship. Everyone can see that. He speaks not of slaves, but of
   friends. He would not have us perform duties from fear of punishment or
   love of reward. That which He can accept of His friends must be the
   fruit of love. His will must be our Law because His Person is our
   delight. Some professors need to be whipped to their duties. They must
   hear stirring sermons and attend exciting meetings and live under
   pressure. But those who are Christ's friends need no spur but love.
   "The love of Christ constrains us." True hearts do what Jesus bids them
   without flogging and dogging, urging and forcing. Constrained virtue is
   spoiled in the making, as many a piece of earthenware is cracked in the
   baking. The wine of our obedience must flow freely from the ripe
   cluster of the soul's love or it will not be fit for the royal cup.
   When duty becomes delight and precepts are as sweet as promises, then
   are we Christ's friends and not till then.

   II. Having thus set forth what kind of obedience Christ requests, I now
   notice, in the second place, that our Lord

   leads us to gather from this sentence that THOSE WHO DO NOT OBEY HIM
   ARE NOT FRIENDS OF HIS. He may

   yet look upon them and be their friend by changing their hearts and
   forgiving their sins, but as yet they are no friends of His, for a man
   who does not obey Christ does not give the Savior His proper place and
   this is an unfriendly deed. If I have

   a friend, I am very careful that if he has honor anywhere, he shall
   certainly have due respect from me. If he is my superior, I am anxious
   that he should not think me intrusive, or imagine that I would take
   undue advantage of his kindness. He will be higher in my esteem than in
   the regard of anyone else.

   He who is truly Christ's friend delights to honor Him as a great King,
   but he who will not yield Him His sovereign rights is a traitor and not
   a friend. Our Lord is the Head over all things to His Church and this
   involves the joyful submission of the members. Disobedience denies to
   Christ the dignity of that holy Headship which is His prerogative over
   all the members of His mystical body and this is not the part of a true
   friend. How can you be His friend if you will not admit His rule? It is
   vain to boast that you trust His Cross if you do not reverence His
   crown! He who does not do His commandments cannot be Christ's friend
   because he is not of one mind with Christ--that is evident. Can two
   walk together unless they are agreed?

   True friendship exists not between those who differ upon first
   principles and there can be no points of agreement between Jesus Christ
   and the man who will not obey Him, for he, in fact, says, "Lord Jesus,
   Your pure and holy will is obnoxious to me! Your sweet and gracious
   commands are a weariness to me!" What friendship can be here? They are
   not of one mind--Christ is for holiness--this man is for sin! Christ is
   for spiritual-mindedness--this man is carnal-minded. Christ is for
   love, this man is for self. Christ is for glorifying the Father, this
   man is for honoring himself--how can there be any friendship when they
   are diametrically opposed in design, object and spirit? It is not
   possible!

   He who obeys not Christ cannot be Christ's friend though he may profess
   to be. He may be a very high and loud professor and for that reason he
   may be all the more an enemy of the Cross, for when men see this man
   walking according to his own lusts, they cry out, "You, also, were with
   Jesus of Nazareth," and they attribute all his faults to his religion
   and straightway begin to blaspheme the name of Christ! Through the
   inconsistent conduct of our Lord's professed friends, His cause is more
   hindered than by anything else! Suppose you and I had some very
   intimate associate who was found drunk in the street, or committing
   burglary or theft? Should we not feel disgraced by his conduct? When he
   was brought before the magistrate would you like to have it said, "This
   person is the bosom friend of So-and-So"?

   Oh, you would cover your face and beg your neighbors never to mention
   it. For such a fellow to be known as your friend would compromise your
   name and character. We say this even weeping, that Jesus Christ's name
   is compromised and His honor is tarnished among men by many who wear
   the name of Christian without having the spirit of Christ! Such cannot
   be His dear companions. Alas for the wounds which Jesus has received in
   the house of His friends! When Caesar fell, he was slain by the daggers
   of his friends! In trust he found treason. Those whose lives he had
   spared, spared not his life. Woe to those who, under the garb of
   Christianity, crucify the Lord afresh and put Him to an open shame!

   Nothing burns Christ's cheeks like a Judas kiss and He has had many
   such. Those that obey Him not cannot be acknowledged by Jesus as His
   friends, for that would dishonor Him, indeed. Time was--I know not how
   it is now--when if any man wanted to be made a count, or to get an
   honorable title, he had only to pay so much at Rome into the Papal bank
   and he could be made a noble at once. The titles thus purchased were
   neither honorable to those who gave them nor to those who received
   them. Whatever his pretended vicar may do, our Lord Himself sells no
   dignities. The title of "Friends of Jesus" goes with a certain
   character and cannot be otherwise obtained.

   Those are His friends who obey Him--"If you love Me, keep My
   commandments." He grants this patent of nobility to all Believers who
   lovingly follow Him, but on His list of friends He enters none beside.
   Do you not see that His honor requires this? Would you have our Lord
   stand up and say, "The drunk is My friend"? Would you hear Him say,
   "That fraudulent bankrupt is My intimate companion"? Would you have
   Jesus claim friendly companionship with the vicious and profane? A man
   is known by his company--what would be thought of Jesus if His intimate
   associates were men of loose morals and unrighteous principles? To go
   among them for their good is one thing. To make them His friends is
   another.

   Where there is no kinship, no likeness, no point of agreement, the fair
   flower of friendship cannot take root. We may, therefore, read the text
   negatively, "You are not My friends, if you do not the things which I
   command you."

   III. Our third observation is--THOSE WHO BEST OBEY CHRIST ARE ON THE
   BEST OF TERMS WITH HIM. "You are My friends," He seems to say, "and
   live near to Me, enjoying practical personal friendship and daily
   communion with Me when you promptly obey." Some of you know by personal
   experience, Brothers and Sisters, that you cannot walk in holy union
   with Christ unless you keep His commandments. There is no feeling of
   communion between our souls

   and Christ when we are conscious of having done wrong and yet are not
   sorry for it. If we know that we have erred, as we often do, and our
   hearts break because we have grieved our Beloved and we go and tell Him
   our grief and confess our sin, we are still His friends and He kisses
   away our tears, saying, "I know your weakness. I willingly blot out
   your offenses. There is no breach of friendship between us. I will
   still manifest Myself to you."

   When we know that we are wrong and feel no softening of heart about it,
   then we cannot pray, we cannot speak with the Beloved and we cannot
   walk with Him as His friends. Familiarity with Jesus ceases when we
   become familiar with known sin. If, again, knowing any act to be wrong
   we persevere in it, there cannot be any happy friendship between us and
   our Savior. If conscience has told you, dear Brother, that
   such-and-such a thing ought to be given up and you continue in it, the
   next time you are on your knees you will feel yourself greatly
   hampered. And when you sit down before your open Bible and hope to have
   communion with Christ as you have formerly enjoyed, you will find that
   He has withdrawn Himself and will not be found by you. Is there any
   wonder?

   If sin lies at the door, how can the Lord smile on us? Secret sin will
   poison communion at the fountainhead. If there is a quarrel between you
   and Christ and you are hugging to your bosom that which He abhors, how
   can you enjoy friendship? He tells you that sin is a viper that will
   kill you, but you reply, "It is a necklace ofjewels" and, therefore,
   you put it about your neck. Do you wonder that because He loves you He
   is grieved at such mad behavior? Oh, do not thus bring injury upon
   yourself! Do not thus pour contempt upon His wise commands! Some
   Christians will never get into full fellowship with Christ because they
   neglect to study His Word and search out what His will is. It ought to
   be a serious work with every Christian, especially in commencing his
   career, to find what is the will of his Lord on all subjects.

   Half the Christian people in the world are content to ask, "What is the
   rule of our Church?" That is not the question--the question is--"What
   is the rule of Christ?" Some plead, "My father and mother before me did
   so." I sympathize, in a measure, with that feeling. Filial reverence
   commands admiration, but yet, in spiritual things we are to call no
   man, "father," but make the Lord Jesus our Master and exemplar. God has
   not placed your conscience in your mother's keeping, nor has He
   committed to your father the right or the power to stand responsible
   for you--every man must bear his own burden and render his own account.

   Search the Scriptures for yourselves, each one of you, and follow no
   rule but that which is Inspired. Take your light directly from the sun!
   Let holy Scripture be your unquestioned rule of faith and practice and,
   if there is any point about which you are uncertain, I charge you by
   your loyalty to Christ, if you are His friends, try and find out what
   His will is. And when you once are sure upon that point, never mind the
   human authorities or dignitaries that oppose His Law. Let there be no
   question, no hesitation, no delay. If He commands you, carry out His
   will though the gates of Hell thunder at you! You are not His friends,
   or, at any rate, you are not His friends so as to enjoy the friendship
   unless you resolutely seek to please Him in all things!

   The intimacy between you and Christ will be disturbed by sin. You
   cannot lean your head upon His bosom and say, "Lord, I know Your will,
   but I do not mean to do it." Could you look up into that dear
   face--that visage once so marred, now lovelier than Heaven, itself--and
   say, "My Lord, I love You, but I will not do Your will in every point"?
   By the very love He bears to you, He will chasten you for that
   rebellious spirit if you indulge in it! It is a horrible evil! Holy
   eyes will not endure it! He is a jealous lover and will not tolerate
   sin, which is His rival. "You are My friends if you do whatever I
   command you." Oh, Beloved, see to this! Under all the crosses and
   losses and trials of life, there is no comfort more desirable than the
   confidence that you have aimed at doing your Lord's will.

   If a man suffers for Christ's sake while steadily pursuing the course
   of holiness, he may rejoice in such suffering. Losses borne in the
   defense of the right and the true are gains! Jesus is never nearer His
   friends than when they bravely bear shame for His sake. If we get into
   trouble by our own folly, we feel the smart at our very heart. But if
   we are wounded in our Lord's battles, the scars are honorable. For His
   sake we may accept reproach and bind it about us as a wreath of honor.
   Jesus delights to be the Companion of those who are cast out by
   kinsfolk and acquaintances for the Truth of God's sake and for fidelity
   to His Cross.

   They may call the faithful one fanatic and enthusiast and all such
   ill-sounding names, but over these there is no need to fret, for the
   honor of being Christ's friend infinitely outweighs the world's
   opinion. When we follow the Lamb wherever He goes, He is responsible
   for the results--we are not--

   "Though dark is my way, since He is my guide,

   'Tis mine to obey, 'tis His to provide."

   The consequences which follow from our doing right belong to God! Abhor
   the theory that for the sake of a great good you may do a little wrong!
   I have heard men say, yes, Christian men, too, "If I were strictly to
   follow my convictions I should have to leave a post of great usefulness
   and, therefore, I remain where I am and quiet my conscience as well as
   I can. I should lose opportunities of doing good which I now possess if
   I were to put in practice all I believe and, therefore, I remain in a
   position which I could not justify on any other ground."

   Is this according to the mind of Jesus? Is this your kindness to your
   Friend? How many bow in the house of Rimmon and hope that the Lord will
   have mercy upon His servants in this thing? We shall see if it will be
   so. We may not do evil that good may come! If I knew that to do right
   would shake this whole island I should be bound to do it! God helping
   me, I would do it! And if I heard that a wrong act would apparently
   bless a whole nation, I have no right to do wrong on that account. No
   bribe of supposed usefulness should purchase our conscience. Right is
   right and must always end in blessing--and wrong is wrong and must
   always end in curse, though for a while it may wear the appearance of
   surpassing good. Did not the devil lead our first parents astray by the
   suggestion that great benefit would arise out of their transgression?
   "Your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as gods," said the
   arch-deceiver!

   Would it not be a grand thing for men to grow unto gods? "Certainly,"
   says Eve, "I would not lose the opportunity. The race which is yet to
   be would blame me if I did. I would not have men remain inferior
   creatures through my neglect." For the sake of the promised good, she
   ventured upon evil. Thousands of people sin because it seems so
   advantageous, so wise, so necessary, so sure to turn out well. Hear
   what Christ says--"You are My friends if you do whatever I command
   you." If you do evil that good may come, you cannot walk with Jesus!
   But if your heart is set towards His statutes you shall find Him loving
   you and taking up His abode with you.

   IV. Fourthly, by our text we are taught that THE MOST FRIENDLY ACTION A
   MAN CAN DO FOR JESUS IS TO OBEY HIM--"You are My friends if you do
   whatever I command you." Rich men have thought to do the most friendly
   act possible towards Christ by giving an immense sum to build a church,
   or to found almshouses or schools. If they are Believers and have done
   this thing as an act of obedience to Christ's Law of stewardship, they
   have done well and the more of such munificence the better. But where
   splendid benefactions are given out of ostentation, or from the idea
   that some merit will be gained by the consecration of a large amount of
   wealth, the whole business is unacceptable!

   If a man should give all the substance of his house for love it would
   utterly be contemned. Jesus asks not lavish expenditure, but ourselves.
   He has made this the token of true love--"If you do whatever I command
   you." "To obey is better than sacrifice and to listen than the fat of
   rams." However much we are able to give, we are bound to give it and
   should give it cheerfully. But if we suppose that any amount of giving
   can stand as a substitute for personal obeying we are greatly mistaken.
   To bring our wealth and not to yield our hearts is to give the casket
   and steal the jewels. How dare we bring our sacrifice in a leprous
   hand? We must be cleansed in the atoning blood before we can be
   accepted and our hearts must be changed before our offering can be pure
   in God's sight.

   Others have imagined that they could show their friendliness to Christ
   by some remarkable action of self-mortification. Among Romanists,
   especially in the old times, it was believed that misery and merit went
   together and so men tortured themselves that they might please God.
   They went for many a day without washing themselves or their clothes
   and fancied that they thus acquired the odor of sanctity! I do not
   believe that Jesus thinks a man any more His friend because he is
   dirty. Some have put on a hair shirt, or have worn a chain belt next to
   their skin which made raw wounds. I do not think that the kind Lord
   Jesus counts these things to be friendly acts. Ask any humane person
   whether he would be gratified by knowing that a friend wore a hair
   shirt for his sake and he would answer, "Pray let the poor creature
   wear whatever is most comfortable to him and that will please me best."

   The loving Jesus takes no delight in pain and discomfort--the starving
   of the body is no doctrine of His. John the Baptist might be an
   ascetic, but certainly Jesus was not--He came eating and drinking, a
   man among men! He did not come to demand the rigors of a hermitage or a
   monastery, else He had never been seen at feasts. When we hear of the
   nuns of St. Ann sleeping bolt upright in their coffins, we take no
   particular satisfaction in their doing so--a kind heart would beg them
   to go to bed. I went to a monastery some time ago and over each bed was
   a little cat-o'nine tails, which I sincerely hope was used to the
   satisfaction of the possessor, but I did not copy the idea and buy a
   couple for my sons! Neither have I sent one to each of my special
   friends, for I should never ask them to flog themselves as a proof of
   friendship!

   Our Lord cannot be gratified by self-inflicted, self-invented tortures!
   These things are will-worship, which is no worship at all! You may fast
   40 days if you like, but you will gain no merit by it. Jesus Christ has
   not demanded this as the gauge of friendship, neither will He regard us
   as His friends for this. He says, "You are My friends if you do
   whatever I command you," but He does not command you to starve, or to
   wear sackcloth, or to shut yourselves up in a cell. Pride invents these
   things, but Grace teaches obedience! Certain persons have thought it
   would be the noblest form of holy service to enter into brotherhoods
   and sisterhoods. They fancied that they would be Christ's friends,
   indeed, if they joined "the Society of Jesus."

   I have sometimes asked myself whether it might not be well to form a
   league of Christian men all banded together, to live alone for Jesus
   and to give themselves up entirely and wholly to His work--but
   assuredly the formation of guilds, sisterhoods, or brotherhoods other
   than the great brotherhood of the Church of God is a thing never
   contemplated in the New Testament--you shall find no foreshadowing of
   Franciscans and Dominicans there! All godly women were Sisters of Mercy
   and all Christ-like men were of the Society of Jesus, but of monastic
   and conventual vows we read nothing! That which is not commanded in
   Scripture is superstition! We are to worship God according to His will,
   not according to our will.

   And though I were to consecrate myself entirely to what Papists called
   the "religious life" and get away from the associations of ordinary men
   and try to spend my whole time in lonely contemplations, yet there
   would be nothing in it, because the Lord Jesus never required it at my
   hands. The thing that He does ask for is that we will do whatever He
   commands us. Why is it that people try to do something which He never
   commanded? A schoolmaster will suffer me to appeal to him on this
   point. If he said to a boy in the school, "Now is the time for you to
   take your slate and attend to arithmetic," and the boy, instead,
   fetched his copy-book, would he not ask if he had understood him? If,
   after a few minutes, he finds the boy writing, does he say, "You have
   written that line very well?" Not at all! It is small matter whether
   the writing is well or ill done, for to be writing at all when he was
   told to be ciphering is a gross act of insubordination!

   So is it with you and me. We may do something else and do it splendidly
   well and other people may say, "What a pious man he is." But if we do
   not the Lord's will, we shall not be His friends. We may wear a piece
   of leather for a sandal and brown serge for a garment and not wear
   boots and coats, but there is no Grace in apparel! Excellence lies in
   doing what Christ has commanded! Some think it a very friendly act
   towards Christ to attend many religious services in a consecrated
   building. They are at matins and vespers and feasts and fasts without
   number. Some of us prefer to have our religious services each day in
   our own homes and it will be a dreadful thing when family prayer is
   given up for public services. But a number of people think little of
   family devotion--they need to go to the parish church or to some other
   temple made with hands--but let no man dream that Jesus is thus made
   our friend!

   We are not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together as the
   manner of some is. It is well to be found meeting with God's people as
   often as we can. But still, you may multiply your sacraments and
   increase your ceremonies and you may attend to this service and to the
   other service until your heart is worn away with grinding at the mill
   of outward religion--but you are Christ's friends only if you do
   whatever He commands you--that is a better test than early communion or
   daily "mass." It comes to this, dear friends, that we must steadily,
   carefully, persistently, cheerfully do the will of God from the heart
   in daily life--from the first waking moment till our eyes are closed.
   Say concerning everything, "What would Jesus have me do about this?
   What is the teaching of Christ as to this?" "Whether you eat or drink,
   or whatever you do, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks
   unto God and the Father by Him."

   You may be a domestic servant and never be able to give a pound to
   church work, but you are Jesus' friend if you do whatever He commands
   you. You may be a housewife and not able to do anything outside of the
   little family which requires all your attention, but if you are
   fulfilling your duty to your children, doing that which Christ commands
   you, you are among the friends of Jesus! You may be only a plain
   working man, or a tradesman with a small shop. Nobody hears of your
   name, but if you set the example of honesty, uprightness and piety,
   doing all things as to Christ because He has saved you, He will call
   you His friend. What patent of nobility can equal this? Friendship with
   Christ is worth a thousand dukedoms!

   The practical outcome of it all is this--examine every question as to
   duty by the light of this one enquiry--"Will this be a friendly action
   to Christ? If I do this, shall I act as Christ's friend? Will my
   conduct honor Him? Then I am glad. If it will dishonor Him, I will have
   nothing to do with it." Set each distinct action, as far as you are
   able, in the scales and

   let this be the weight--is it a friendly action towards your Redeemer?
   I wish that we all lived as if Jesus were always present, as if we
   could see His wounds and gaze into His lovely countenance. Suppose that
   tomorrow you are brought into temptation by being asked to do something
   questionable? Decide it this way--if Jesus could come in at that moment
   and show you His hands and His feet, how would you act in His sight?

   Behave as you would act under the realized Presence of the
   Well-Beloved. You would not do anything unkind to Him, would you?
   Certainly you would not do anything to grieve Him if you saw Him before
   your eyes! Well, keep Him always before you. The Psalmist cried, "I
   have set the Lord always before me." You will need much of the Holy
   Spirit's anointing to do this. May God give it to you. Live, dear
   Friends, as if Christ would come at once and detect you in the very
   act. Do that which you would not be ashamed of if the next instant you
   should see the Lord sitting on the Throne of His Glory and calling you
   before His bar. Thus living, you shall delight yourself in the
   abundance of peace--

   "So shall your walk be close with God,

   Calm and serene your frame.

   So purer light shall mark the road

   That leads you to the Lamb."

   Obedience will gladden you with the blissful Presence of your Lord and
   in that Presence you shall find fullness of joy. You shall be the
   envied of all wise men, for you shall be the beloved of the Lord. And
   your pathway, if it is not always smooth, shall always be safe, for
   Jesus never leaves His friends and He will never leave you! He will
   keep you even to the end. May this be my happy case and yours. Amen.

Faith Working By Love

   (No. 1553)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, AUGUST 15, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Faith which works by love." Galatians 5:6.

   ALL ways of justification by human works and outward forms are set
   aside by the Apostle. In one sentence he closes up every road which is
   cast up by man and opens up the way of the Lord, even the way of
   salvation by Grace through faith in Christ Jesus. Some hope to be saved
   by ritualism--their hopes are struck hip and thigh by these words,
   "Neither circumcision avails anything." On the other hand, many are
   relying upon their freedom from all ceremonies and place their reliance
   upon a sort of anti-ritualism--they are struck by the words, "nor
   uncircumcision." As Jews relied upon circumcision, so do many depend
   upon Baptism and sacraments--to these the Apostle gives no quarter.
   Others glory in uncircumcision--they have practiced no rites nor
   ceremonies--their mode of worship is plain even to unsightliness, free
   almost to disorder and of this they are apt to make a righteousness.

   It is quite as easy to make a self-righteousness out of the plainness
   of the Quaker as out of the gaudiness of the Romanist and the one
   confidence will be as fatal as the other. You and I, as Baptists, may
   glory in the simplicity of our worship and the Scripturalness of our
   Baptism, but if we think that outward things will save us because they
   are Scripturally simple, we shall err as much as they do who multiply
   gorgeous services and pompous processions. Let the whole sentence be
   quoted! Paul says, "Neither circumcision avails anything," but he does
   not stop there, for he adds, "nor uncircumcision." The outward, whether
   decorated or unadorned; whether fixed or free, touches not the saving
   point--the only thing which can save us is faith in Jesus Christ, whom
   God has set forth as a Propitiation for sin.

   Faith brings us into contact with the healing fountain and so our
   natural disease is removed. It appropriates, on our behalf, the result
   of the Redeemer's service and sacrifice and so we become accepted in
   Him. But anything short of this must fail--it is the tearing of the
   garment while the heart is unbroken--the washing of the outside of the
   cup and platter while the inner part is very filthiness. The Apostle,
   however, does more than merely condemn other foundations than those of
   faith--he distinguishes here between faith, itself, and its many
   imitations. It is not every sort of faith that will save the soul.

   True faith, undoubtedly, will save a man though it is but as a grain of
   mustard seed. But it must be true faith--the genuine silver and not a
   mere plated article. "Money answers all things," says the wise man, but
   then it must be current coin of the realm, for counterfeit money will
   answer for nothing except to condemn the man who has it in his
   possession! Real faith will save us, but forgeries of it will increase
   our peril. Assurance is of God, but presumption is of the devil. The
   test of true faith is that it works--"Faith which works," says the
   text. To that end it must, first of all, live, for it is clear that a
   dead faith cannot work. There must be heart in our faith and the Spirit
   of God breathing in it, or it will not be the living faith of a living
   child of God.

   Being alive, true faith must not sleep, but must awaken itself as a
   child of the day, for a slumbering faith is matter for heart-searching,
   since sleep is a cousin to Death. A wakeful faith becomes active and in
   its activity lies much of its proof. "By their fruits you shall know
   them" is one of Christ's own rules for testing men and things--and we
   are to know faith by that which comes of it--by what it does for us and
   in us and through us. Faith is not worth having if it is fruitless. It
   has a name to live and is dead. If it works not at all, it lives not at
   all and cannot justify its possession. A dead god may be served by a
   dead faith, but only a living, waking, working faith can please the
   ever-living, ever-working Jehovah. God save us from a dreaming faith
   and a talking faith and give us "faith which works."--

   "Not words alone it cost the Lord To purchase pardon for His own. Nor
   will a soul by Grace restored

   Return the Savior words alone.'

   A further distinction is also set forth, namely, that true faith "works
   by love." There are some who do many works as the result of a kind of
   faith who, nevertheless, are not justified. As for instance, Herod, who
   believed in John and did many things and yet murdered his minister. His
   faith worked, but it worked by dread and not by love--he feared the
   stern language of the second Elijah and the judgments which would come
   upon him if he rejected the Baptist's warnings and so his faith worked
   through fear. The great test of the working of saving faith is this--it
   "works by love." If you are led by your faith in Jesus Christ to love
   Him and so to serve Him, then you have the faith of God's elect. You
   are, then, undoubtedly, a saved man and you may go your way and rejoice
   in the liberty with which Christ has made you free.

   It shall be joy to you to serve the Lord, since love is the mainspring
   of your service. That is the point we are going to speak upon this
   morning--the connection which exists between faith and love--"Faith
   which works by love." We may be helped to test both our faith and love
   while we are speaking of the intermingling and intertwisting of the
   roots and branches of these two Divine Graces and it will do us good to
   perform a thorough self-examination. It never does any man harm to
   overhaul himself and to see in what a state he is--whether he is really
   right or not--whether he is prospering in soul or not.

   I am afraid of our taking our good estate for granted, but I am not
   afraid of the most searching self-enquiry. May God the Holy Spirit
   bless our ministry to this end this morning!

   I. Our first observation will be this--FAITH ALWAYS PRODUCES
   LOVE--"Faith which works by love." When faith has anything to do, she
   walks to the field with Love at her side. The two Divine Graces are
   inseparable. Like Mary and Martha, they are sisters and abide in one
   house. Faith, like Mary, sits at Jesus' feet and hears His Words and
   then Love diligently goes about the house and rejoices to honor the
   Divine Lord. Faith is light, while Love is heat and in every beam of
   Grace from the Sun of Righteousness you will find a measure of each.
   True faith in God cannot exist without love to Him, nor sincere love
   without faith. They are united, like Siamese twins, and where you meet
   the one the other is sure to be present.

   This happens by a necessity of faith's own nature. The moment a man
   believes in Jesus Christ, he loves Him as a matter of course. It is
   possible to trust in another person and not love him, but from the
   peculiar circumstances of the case, our Lord, having loved us and given
   Himself for us out of the infinite charity of His heart, we are
   compelled to love Him the moment we repose upon Him. To trust the
   bleeding Lamb and not love Him is a thing not to be imagined! Faith is
   a gold ring which, in every case, the heavenly Jeweler sets with the
   beryl of love. Water faith with a drop of God's own dew and it blossoms
   into love!

   The first steps of the prodigal, when he comes to himself, are all
   towards his father's house and heart. When he gets home he may make
   many steps here and there about his father's estate, but at the first,
   at any rate, his face is distinctly towards his father. Did he not say,
   "I will arise and go unto my father"? The first steps of the soul, when
   it begins to believe in God, are desires after Him in which there is a
   measure of love. The affections are awakened and drawn towards God as
   soon as there is the slightest degree of faith in the soul. Every
   Believer here knows that. Look back to the day when you first saw the
   Lord, if you can remember it--the hour you looked to Him and were
   lightened--did you not love Him immediately?

   Love Him? Yes! We sometimes fear we loved Him better then, than now,
   though I hope that it is not the case. If anyone had asked me, in the
   first flush of my joy when first I beheld my bleeding Lord, "Do you
   love Him?" I should not have hesitated, but replied, "I love Him as my
   very soul, for He has redeemed me from going down into the Pit." Faith
   creates love as summer breeds flowers! Our first love came with our
   first faith by a necessity of nature which can never change. Love grows
   out of faith yet farther by the discoveries of beauty in Christ which
   faith is sure to make. Faith is the soul's eye and its telescope by
   which it sees that which is so far off as to otherwise be invisible.
   Holy faith gazes upon the Character of the Lord Jesus Christ, realizes
   His Person and discerns His matchless work and so creates knowledge out
   of which comes love.

   Faith stands like the cherubim upon the golden Mercy Seat, looking
   downward always upon the blood-sprinkled Propitiatory, admiring and
   wondering, spying out something fresh every hour and thus filling
   itself with ever-increased delight with those things which the angels
   desire to look into. Out of this gracious discernment comes admiring
   love. Faith delights to unveil the superlative beauties of the
   Well-Beloved before the gaze of Love and then Faith and Love

   unite in crying out, "Yes, He is altogether lovely!" Those who believe
   can say, "We see Jesus," and those whose hearts are won by Him can add,
   "We loved Him because He first loved us." O that we knew our Lord
   better! O that we believed in Him more! Then should we be knit to Him
   as the heart of Jonathan was knit to David.

   Faith creates love, next, by its appropriation of that which it
   discerns, for while faith is the soul's eye, it is also the mind's
   hands by which it grasps the blessing. Faith sees the love of Christ
   and then says, "He loved me and gave Himself for me." Faith sees the
   wounds of Jesus and perceives His Deity through those windows of ruby
   and immediately appropriates Him and cries, "My Lord and my God." Love
   is sure to arise out of a sense of possession. Does not a mother love
   her child very much because it is her own?

   When we have an interest in a person so as to call him, "my brother,"
   "my husband," "my son," then a sense of property increases our sense of
   affection. This made the Psalmist sing, "O God, You are my God, early
   will I seek You." Why, even in dead things, such as gold and silver and
   goods and lands, when they are a man's own they are apt to be loved,
   for the affections cling to that which is possessed--"Where your
   treasure is there will your heart be also." And therefore, the danger
   which attends worldly things, lest our heart be bird-limed with them
   and so be held captive, instead of mounting upward towards God. This
   tendency is clearly seen in reference to higher possessions and
   especially with regard to Christ. If Christ is yours and Faith can say,
   "Jesus is mine," Love alters the sentence and cries, "This is my
   Beloved and this is my Friend."

   When the faith of Thomas saw Jesus as Lord and God, his love gave a
   musical ring to his exclamation by joying in personal possession and
   calling Him, "my Lord and my God." Love rejoices in Jesus as her own
   possession, triumphs in Him and right sweetly sings of love to Him
   because He is her own Husband and Lord. Thus you see faith creates love
   from a necessity of its nature, from the discoveries which it makes and
   from its appropriation of the good things that are in Christ. Dear
   Hearer, do you know anything about these matters? Faith further excites
   love by another step, namely, by its enjoying the mercy and then
   leading the heart to a grateful acknowledgment of the source of the
   mercy. There are two links in the chain in this case--faith wins the
   mercy by prayer--the mercy is enjoyed and then out of the enjoyment of
   the gift springs love to Him who gave it.

   Brothers and Sisters, what innumerable favors faith has already brought
   to us! Some of you, I trust, do not look upon the Covenant as a
   locked-up storeroom from which nothing is to be taken until you come to
   die. But the key of David has been put into your hands by faith and you
   have enjoyment, even now, of the fat things full of marrow and the
   wines on the lees well-refined which the Lord has prepared for them
   that love Him. At this moment you know that you are justified; you know
   that you are adopted into the family of God--do you not, therefore,
   love the Lord? I know you do! You feel, at this moment, that you are
   enjoying the privileges of heirship with Christ--does not this bind you
   fast to your elder Brother?

   Every day you are receiving Providential mercies. I hope you keep your
   eyes open to see them--every day you are receiving preserving mercies,
   restoring mercies, instructive mercies, sealing mercies--do you not
   love God for all these priceless gifts? Spiritual blessings are coming
   to you from the God of All Grace and you are filled with joys, like
   your Savior's grief--immense, unknown--surely this cements your soul to
   your Redeemer! Unless your heart is altogether out of order, you love
   God better and better because He is manifesting His love to you more
   and more. Is it not so? Faith told you that the Lord was good and then
   she cried, "I will prove it to you," and she handed out of the Covenant
   storehouse mercies rich and rare and laid them at your feet! And since
   you have possessed them and lived upon them as your own, you have
   blessed the Giver and loved Him more than you ever did before.

   Thus Faith receives promises and feeds Love on the fruit of them. It
   does this even more sweetly by the familiarity with God which it breeds
   in the heart, for Faith is in the habit of going to God with all her
   burdens and coming away with her load removed. Faith has the daily
   practice of pleading promises with God, speaking to Him face to face as
   a man speaks with his friend and receiving favors from the right hand
   of the Most High which make even her expectant soul to wonder! Faith
   commences with God in the morning, as Abraham did, and walks with Him
   in the field at evening, as Isaac did. Faith houses herself with God as
   the swallow built her nest under the eaves of the temple. Faith's life
   is in God, even as the life of a fish is in the sea.

   The bosom of Jesus Christ is the pillow of faith and the heart of God
   is the pavilion of faith. Because faith thus keeps us near to God, it
   causes us to love Him. Oh, poor blind Soul, if you could see Jesus, you
   would love Him! You who are

   most opposed to Him would become His friends if you knew Him! It is not
   possible for a Believer to be in Christ's company an hour without
   feeling his heart warmed. The pilgrims to Emmaus said, "Did not our
   hearts burn within us while He spoke with us by the way?" Those who
   have known and believed His love towards them must feel His spell upon
   their affections holding them captive. There is none like He among the
   sons of men--His beauties ravish the heart! If Jesus does but lift the
   veil and let us have a glimpse of one of His eyes for a moment, our
   hearts are melted within us--

   "Where can such sweetness be

   As I have tasted in Your love,

   As I have found in Thee?"

   Because faith thus makes us familiar with our Divine Lord, it must
   inevitably produce love in the soul. And here again, are two links
   instead of one--our familiarity with Christ soon begets congeniality of
   disposition and spirit, for that we are much with Christ--we become
   much like Christ. He who lies on a bed of spices will naturally find
   his garments smell of the same. A mirror upon which the sun is shining
   is, itself, bright and flashes its reflected rays afar. He that walks
   with wise men will be wise, but he that dwells with the Infinite Wisdom
   shall be taught of God! Doubtless, happy couples who live together in
   mutual affection and confidence become very much like each other--the
   one becomes the other's self--they have the same aims and objectives,
   they are often surprised to find that they have thought the same
   thoughts and are about to say the same words at the same moment.

   So do the saint and the Savior grow like each other after years of
   acquaintance, only the growth is all on one side-- we grow up unto Him
   in all things who is the Head. Oh that our likeness to Christ were as
   clear and complete as our likeness to our dear companions below! You
   see how love is thus nurtured in the soul by a growing likeness of
   disposition. Wherever there is congeniality of taste, mind, view,
   disposition and spirit, love becomes strong and well established. And
   thus faith, by begetting in us likeness to Christ, causes love to
   Christ to become a mighty power in the soul! Surely all these points
   sufficiently show that faith creates love in the soul wherever it
   really dwells.

   Do not, I pray you, begin to say, "I am afraid I do not love the Lord
   as I ought," and so on. Take it for granted that you do not love Him to
   the fullest of His infinite deserts. Instead of raising questions about
   the degree of your love, ask yourself whether you believe in Him. Are
   you trusting in the Lord Jesus? Are you confiding in Him? Because if
   the root is there, the flower will appear before long. If you believe
   that Jesus is the Christ, you are born of God and all who are born of
   the God of Love must, themselves, love God. Do not talk of trying to
   love God. You cannot force yourself to love anybody--who in his senses
   would ever dream of such a thing? Such attempts would be utter folly.

   Love must be free-born, it cannot be bought or forced. We cannot tell
   what love is though we feel it. It is a mysterious something not to be
   described by the cold maker of definitions, but it is always a product
   of something else which goes before it. If you believe, you will love.
   If you do not believe you will never love till you believe. Go to the
   root of the matter. Do not try to grow the hyacinth of love without the
   bulb of faith. Do you trust Jesus with all your heart and are you
   confiding your soul's eternal interests with Him? Then I know that you
   love Him, though you may, for a while, be occupied with other pursuits.

   Love slumbers in you like fire in a flint, or rather, it smolders like
   fire in smoldering turf. But before long it will burn vehemently like
   coals of juniper! Look well to your faith and your love will not fail.
   Remember the lines of a sweet poet and pray that you may sing them out
   of your own soul--

   "Hallelujah! I believe!

   Now, OLove! I know your power,

   You have no false or fragile fetters,

   Nor the rose-wreaths of an hour.

   Christian bonds of holy union

   Death itself does not destroy;

   Yes, to live and love forever,

   Is our heritage of joy."

   II. Let me now enlarge upon a second remark--LOVE IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT
   UPON FAITH. "Faith which works by love." Love, then, does not work of
   itself, except in the strength of faith. Love is so entirely dependent
   upon faith that, as I have already said, it cannot exist without it! No
   man loves a Savior in whom he reposes no confidence. There may be an
   admiration of the Character of Christ, but the emotion which the
   Scripture treats as, "love," only comes

   into the heart when we trust in Jesus. "We love Him because He first
   loved us." When we have a belief in His love and a sense of it, then we
   begin to love Jesus--but love to Jesus cannot exist without faith in
   Him.

   Certainly love cannot flourish except as faith flourishes. If you doubt
   your Lord, you will think harsh thoughts of Him and cease to love Him
   as you should. If you fall into trouble and you doubt His wisdom, or
   His goodness in sending it, the next thing will be that your heart will
   be cold towards Him--you will begin to think your Lord to be tyrannical
   and harsh to you and you will quarrel with Him. The two Graces must
   diminish or increase together! If you attain to a simple, childlike
   confidence which rests in Christ as a babe on its mother's bosom
   reposes entirely in her care, then shall your love be made perfect! But
   if you need to trust yourself a little and you begin judging your God
   and do not repose entirely in Him, then it is that you have to ask
   yourself whether you love Him or not. May God the Holy Spirit work in
   us a mighty strength of faith that we may have a vehement love, strong
   as death, immortal as Divinity!

   Love, again, as it cannot flourish without faith, so it cannot work
   without it. Love is a great designer and planner, but how to perform,
   it finds not unless faith shows the way. Love sits down and says, "I
   wish the world were converted to Christ!" But Faith goes out and
   preaches the Gospel. Love cries, "I would to God that the children knew
   of Jesus and that their hearts were renewed even while they are yet
   little!" But Faith opens the Sunday school and teaches the young and
   trusts in God that He will bless the Word to their salvation. Love must
   have faith to give it muscle, sinew and strength--therefore take right
   good care of your faith.

   Longfellow says, "Therefore love and believe, and works will follow
   spontaneously, even as the day the sun." Love is as Solomon's lily,
   dropping sweet-smelling myrrh. How fair to look upon! Stand and admire
   its charms. Know, O gazer, that yon lovely flower could not be thus
   arrayed were it not joined by its stalk to a living root which is
   hidden underground! Faith is the necessary bulb out of which comes love
   as the perfection of beauty. You look over the fair city of Mansoul and
   you see a gilded dome glittering in the sun--that dome is love and it
   rests upon foundations of faith which are laid deep upon the
   rock--otherwise the dome would fall in ruins. Love to God, if it is
   worthy of the name, must be soundly based on confidence in Jesus. It
   cannot abide without it, but is carried away by wind and flood, like
   the house on the sand.

   Therefore we are disposed to judge with prudence the outbursts of
   emotion which we see in certain excitable persons. We hear them sing,
   "Oh, yes, I love Jesus," but we are not so sure of it when we watch
   their lives. We are pleased with such emotions if they arise out of the
   knowledge of Christ and genuine faith in Him, but we have too often
   seen the semblance of ardent affection without knowledge and without
   humility--without penitence and without childlike faith-- and therefore
   we rejoice with trembling. We fear lest the building which rises up in
   a night should vanish like "the baseless fabric of a vision" and
   disappear like the soap bubble of a child, which, though it is adorned
   with all the colors of the rainbow, dissolves in an instant.

   See, then, to your faith, since love is entirely dependent upon it. See
   that you are rooted and grounded and settled, lest the high tower of
   professed love should soon lie in ruins and only indifference remain.

   III. Thirdly, I advance to another observation which comes more closely
   home to the text though our previous thoughts have been necessary to
   bring us up to it--FAITH DISPLAYS ITS POWER BY LOVE. "Faith which works
   by love." For a moment you must permit me to compare faith to a
   craftsman in metals who is about to prepare some magnificent work which
   cunning smiths were known to produce in the days of worked iron, when
   skill and hand labor were thought much of and articles were produced
   which are almost worth their weight in silver.

   Faith, as a smith, strong and vigorous, has love to be her arms. Faith
   lifts not a finger without love--it is her arm every morning. Faith
   believes and resolves and then it proceeds to action, but the power
   with which it can work lies in love. Faith without love would be a
   cripple without arms. More than this--it is not only Faith's arms but
   her tools. "Faith works by love." This is Faith's hammer and file and
   anvil--her every implement. You have seen a screw hammer which can be
   made to fit every nut and bolt, however large or small--love is just
   such a tool--for love will teach a little child or evangelize a nation!

   Love can stand and burn at the stake, or it can drop two mites that
   make a farthing into the offering box. Love hopes all things, endures
   all things--nothing comes amiss to it. A wonderfully handy tool is this
   sacred Grace which Faith has adopted to work with! It can strike and it
   can cut, it is good for uniting and good for breaking, it will avail
   for anything which Faith wishes to perform. Only let Faith wield love
   as its instrument and it can fashion whatever Divine

   Wisdom tells it to form. More than that, love is Faith's furnace. All
   the tools in the world will not suffice the smith unless he can blow
   the coals and create a fervent heat.

   What is there, Brethren, that can kindle the heat of enthusiasm like
   earnest love to God? Faith believes God and rejoices in God and then
   comes in love and the heart grows hot as Nebuchadnezzar's furnace! The
   melting fire burns right gloriously and sparks ofjoy leap upward from
   it. What is there that cannot be performed if we have enough love? This
   is the great fire which burns in human hearts when God the Holy Spirit
   sheds abroad the love of Jesus--by its heat all things are fused. This
   fire will yet consume all sin and melt all hardness. None can quench
   it, everything must yield before it! That consecrated craftsman called
   Faith, blows the coals of Love and, plunged into its glowing flame,
   tasks difficult as iron is hard become easily workable! Thus, "Faith
   works by love."

   Love is more than this, for, when all is melted and ready to flow, love
   is faith's mold--it pours out all it does into the mold of God's
   Love--fashioning its works according to the Divine pattern of Love in
   Christ Jesus. As Jesus loved us, even so should we love one another.
   And as He loved the Father and for love of the Father, that He might
   glorify Him, fulfilled the Law and made Himself a Sacrifice, even so
   are we willing to lay down our lives for the Brethren and for the
   Father's honor. Thus Love becomes Faith's mold into which she carefully
   seeks to pour out her whole being. What is more, she is Faith's metal,
   for into the mold of love, Faith pours love itself. Love thus "answers
   all things."

   Love is the substance of every good work. Melt it down in the refining
   pot and holiness is love. If there is any virtue, zeal, consecration or
   holy daring, its substance is love. All the grand deeds which the
   heroes of the Cross have performed are composed of the solid metal of
   love to Jesus Christ. Be it great or be it little, he who has served
   God aright has always brought into the sanctuary an offering of pure
   love comparable to the gold of Ophir. Love, also, is Faith's burnisher
   and file and with it she finishes all her work right carefully. Have
   you never lovingly gone over all your work to give it the finishing
   touches? Have you not wished to perfect all that you have attempted? I
   know well what it means.

   My rough castings--how very coarse they are--and when I fix them I look
   at them and say, "That will not do, for I see self there. That will not
   do, unbelief is there. This will not do, too much of self-will is
   there." And then I have with tearful love, filed down and polished my
   poor efforts and found love to be an excellent burnisher, ready to my
   hand. When Augustine went over all his works to write his
   Retractations, it was Love removing roughness from her work. If we
   loved more, we might have more of retractation work to do. Thus Faith
   works by love--love is Faith's arm, Faith's tools, Faith's furnace,
   Faith's metal, Faith's mold and Faith's burnisher.

   My Hearer, if you are working for God in any other way than this, you
   will make a mess of it! The Law can never help you to such work as God
   will accept. It is fitted to produce bars for a prison but not pillars
   for a temple. You must work for God because you love Him--no other
   labor except the labor of love can be acceptable with Him. Some people
   serve God because they are in religious society and they must not be
   thought lacking--therefore that blessed guinea, squeezed out by all the
   ten-pound subscriptions on the list at the top of it--respectable
   people must put down something, you know.

   That occasional going out to week-night services is often done because
   it is expected of you and not because it is a delight. Even Sabbath
   assemblies grow to be a weariness and worship is regarded as a task.
   This is not gold, but gilded dross--take it away! This is forced
   service, devoid of the life-blood of obedience! This is fruit without
   flavor or scent. That which is done because a man loves God, because he
   loves to yield his heart to his God, however humble the service may be,
   is accepted of God. True affection to Him who redeemed you from going
   down to the Pit never fails to present an acceptable tribute before the
   living God! May you abound in this to your own comfort and to the Glory
   of Christ.

   IV. I close with the fourth remark, which is this--LOVE REACTS UPON
   FAITH AND PERFECTS IT. While Love owes everything to Faith, Faith,
   by-and- by, becomes a debtor to Love. Love leads the soul into
   admiration and so increases Faith. Having loved Christ, having become
   enamored of Him, Love, which has dove's eyes which can see everything
   that is fair, spies out, daily, more and more of Christ's perfections
   and thus she aids the eye of Faith. Love sees among the rest of the
   Lord's perfections His power, His faithfulness, His immutability--and
   Faith at once concludes, "Then I can trust Him more than ever."

   Knowing more of His power, more of His faithfulness, more of His
   unchangeableness, I can depend upon Him without wavering. So if Faith's
   eyes first look to Jesus, Love's eyes see yet more and discover further
   excellences. Faith is that other disciple which outran Peter, but Love
   is the disciple which enters in and spies out details. Love, moreover,
   forbids

   unbelief and so helps Faith, for Love says, "How can we grieve Him by
   doubts?" Does not true love in every heart, when exercised towards a
   man or a woman, forbid distrust? Fear in the form of distrust has
   torment and, therefore, love casts it out.

   The lack of mutual confidence in married life is the death of love, but
   love is instinctively tender of showing anything like suspicion towards
   a dear and faithful lover. Even when it supposes that there is an
   error, love puts it down as by no means a willful fault, but concludes
   that there may be a sense in which it is right, for love believes all
   things, endures all things and will not tolerate mistrust which it
   knows to be a worm at the very core of the heart. So you see, where
   there is great love of Christ, it forbids doubt and thus kills the
   foxes of distrust which spoil the tender vines of Faith. Love to Jesus
   feels that it were better to distrust all men and angels than doubt the
   dear Redeemer who poured out His blood to prove His love! Distrust the
   heavens, for they shall pass away. Distrust the earth, for it shall be
   utterly burned up. Distrust man, for he is as a broken reed! But never
   distrust the faithful God! Lean on Him with your whole weight! Repose
   in Him with your undivided confidence. So Love teaches and Faith learns
   her lesson.

   Moreover, perfect Love casts out fear because fear has torment and when
   perfect Love has cast out fear, then Faith has room to display its
   strength. Love has not learned to be afraid, nor will she permit the
   work of Faith to become the labor of a shrinking, crouching slave.
   Dread? Where can that find a lodging in the heart that loves? You hear
   very proper people sometimes cry out against certain of us because they
   say we speak as if we were on the best of terms with God and were
   familiar with the Lord Jesus. Sarcastically they speak what is soberly
   true--in their blindness they have hit the truth--it is even so. To
   them God is a stranger and I doubt not that the language which we use
   may well seem to them strange and almost profane.

   It would be profane if they were to use it, being what they are. I do
   not accuse them of open sin, but I do say and will say that he who is
   not a child of God cannot fitly use expressions which are most becoming
   from the lips of those who are the sons of God. A child may say to his
   father what no one else may dare say and yet he has more reverence for
   him than anyone else. Your child shall rightly behave towards you in a
   manner which you could not tolerate in a stranger. Look at the judge on
   the bench--with that big wig and those solemn robes--the prisoner at
   the bar and the court and the jury must all be very respectful and
   distant. But I guarantee you when his lordship reaches home, his
   grandchild has no dread of grandpapa or his robes!

   Love gives boldness and is yet most reverent--reverently familiar.
   Chilliness and coldness are not for the children of God--they are
   called to close communion with their heavenly Father and the Meeting
   Place is not at Sinai, but at Calvary! Faith and Love are home-living
   children and not out-of-door pensioners. They dwell in the house of the
   Lord forever. Oh Beloved, this is the joy of love, that it brings us
   into such close personal communion with God in Jesus Christ! That
   trembling, slavish fear is gone and, loving God, we are familiar with
   Him and trust Him implicitly. Oh, dear Friends, trust your God with
   everything! Trust Him in little things! Trust Him in great things!
   Trust Him in your joys to keep you sober! Trust Him in your sorrows to
   keep you from despair! Oh, that you may possess much of this love, for
   it is an eminent Grace. "Faith is child-like," says Dr. Eadie. "Hope is
   saint-like, but love is God-like." May we reach this God-like virtue
   through faith in God Himself!

   My final word is this--let us, dear Friends, as a Church and people, be
   working people. Faith works. Let us work because we have faith. I wish
   that every member of this Church were at work for Jesus. I have very
   few complaints, however, because I believe that the majority of the
   dear Brothers and Sisters associated here are hard at it--but if there
   are any of you who are not serving the Lord--I pray you, bestir
   yourselves! You must work or your faith will be questioned and your
   love will be suspect! We are a hive of bees, but what will happen if,
   instead of making honey, the workers all turn to drones? Why, they will
   next turn to wasps!

   If such a change cannot take place in Nature, it certainly occurs in
   morals and spirituals, for we have seen companies of good, hard-working
   Christians suddenly break out into factions and quarrel furiously! When
   bees turn to wasps there is nothing but fighting. May our good Lord
   save us from such a calamity! I do not mind being like the queen bee in
   the hive, king of the bees. But a leader of wasps I cannot be! Dear
   Friends, get to work for the Master--you, I mean, who stand idle all
   the day. Go work, today, in the Savior's vineyard. Oh, my beloved
   Brothers and Sisters, I beseech you, do not relax your energies!
   Continue to be a lively, energetic Church.

   Now that so many Sunday schools need teachers, I charge our friends not
   to let that blessed part of the service lag behind. There are dozens of
   schools crying out for teachers! The children come and there are none
   to instruct them. Should it be so? If you are to be a working Church,
   you must be a loving Church because faith works by love. You must love
   one another much and love Christ more and love the souls of perishing
   sinners! Yes, love them so that you will not let them perish if you can
   do anything towards their salvation. Personal doing of good to men is
   needed if love is to be real. The love of Jesus made Him seek and save
   the lost and if ours is worth the name, we shall be engaged in the same
   holy endeavor.

   But if you are to be a working Church and a loving Church you must be a
   believing Church, for that is the bottom of it all. Faith works by
   love. Get home, then, to prayer and renew your faith in Jesus. May the
   Holy Spirit lead you anew to the dying love of Jesus. I often go
   straight away back to the Cross from which I started when I set out for
   Heaven. The devil says to me, "You are no Christian." I do not think he
   knows much about it, but I have, before now, tried to show him some
   evidences that I am a Christian and he has only puffed at them. I find
   the better way is to go right away to the Cross and say, "I rest on
   Jesus only."

   Satan cannot deny but what you are a Christian when you stand there! Go
   and do your first works and believe in Jesus just as you did at the
   first and abide in Him forevermore. As sinners, cling to Jesus and let
   Him be everything to you. Constant faith will create fervent love and
   fervent love will do persevering work--so shall we be a people zealous
   for good works! The Lord bless every one of you, for Christ's sake.
   Amen.

Redemption By Price

   (No. 1554)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, AUGUST 22, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "You are not your own: for you are bought with a price." 1 Corinthians
   6:19,20.

   ATTACKS have often been made upon the central doctrine of the Gospel,
   namely, the doctrine of Redemption or Atonement, for it is well-known
   to be the crux of the Gospel. These onslaughts have, in many instances,
   been very craftily made. They have professed to be mere corrections of
   our phraseology, but were essentially assaults upon the Truth of God
   itself. We believe that in and through the blood of Jesus we have
   redemption and that we have been ransomed from destruction by the
   Mediator's death, the Lord Jesus having bought us by the suit and
   service which He rendered in our place and on our behalf.

   When we speak very plainly upon this point, certain pretentious
   Divines, whose custom it is to sneer at the old theology, at once raise
   objections to what they are pleased to call, "the mercantile theory of
   Atonement." With weak minds an ugly phrase stands for argument, but in
   this case there is really nothing horrible in the description, even if
   it is allowed all its force. There may have been, among us, certain
   persons who carried ideas of the shop and the counter into their notion
   of redemption, but we maintain that even these were nearer the Truth of
   God than those who reduce the ransom paid by the Lord Jesus to nothing
   and make His Redemption a meaningless figure of speech.

   Within the idea of purchase lies hidden the essence of the Savior's
   work and, therefore, it is to be adhered to. He is coming again to
   complete the Redemption of the purchased possession and we shall not
   forego our hope to please the squeamish. Paul, at any rate, was not
   afraid of the mercantile theory, if men so please to call it, for he
   writes, "You are bought," yes, to make it still more sure, he puts it,
   "bought with a price." This is put very strongly and there is no
   planing it down. If it means anything, it must mean that a price was
   paid for us! Instead of our being forever captives under bondage and
   death, a Ransom has been found, according to that ancient saying,
   "Deliver him from going down to the Pit--I have found a ransom."

   The song of Heaven is no idle rhapsody. Listen how they chant the
   solemn hymn before the Throne of God and the Lamb, saying, "You are
   worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof: for You were
   slain and have redeemed us to God by Your blood out of every kindred
   and tongue and people and nation." Was it not said of Him while He was
   here below, "The Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to
   minister and to give His life a ransom for many"? There was a
   substitutionary Sacrifice presented on the behalf of His people by
   Jesus Christ, who thus redeemed His chosen from their lost estate. This
   was a matter of fact and an efficacious action, actually ransoming
   those who were redeemed.

   We do not believe in a cloudy, phantom-like Atonement, which did
   something or nothing and was a mere exhibition without results. We
   believe that Jesus did actually redeem His people by a Ransom, which
   Ransom was His suffering and death in their place, by which the justice
   of God was satisfied and His Law was honored. If there were no other
   text in Scripture, the one which is now before us would abundantly
   justify us in using those very expressions which have been ridiculed as
   mercantile--"You are not your own: for you are bought with a price."
   Though we were not redeemed with corruptible things, as with silver and
   gold, but with the precious blood of Jesus Christ, yet the transaction
   was, none the less, real and effective. An equivalent was given, a
   possession was secured.

   The fact is, the objection is not merely to the mercantile
   expression--the objection is to the very idea of Substitution and a
   vicarious Sacrifice. The pretense is that mistaken words are
   criticized, but it is a mere pretense--the gun is aimed at Christ's
   bearing Divine Wrath in our place--this is the doctrine which they
   cannot endure! They will have to aim very often and burst their cannon
   before they will be able to destroy our belief in the truth of
   Substitution while we have the 53rd chapter of Isaiah remaining in the
   Bible and other passages of sacred Scripture to the same effect. Even
   if they could disprove the Doctrine of Vicarious Suffering and show
   that Substitution is an ignorant fancy, the best thing they could

   do would be to wring their hands in agony because they had blotted out
   the brightest star that ever shone amid the storm-wreck of a
   tempestuous conscience.

   No Truth of God within the circle of theology is so eminently
   consolatory to souls burdened with sin as the great fact that Jesus
   Christ bore the sins of many and carried away, on His own shoulders,
   the transgressions of His people. Let others believe or disbelieve, I
   nail my colors to the Cross where Jesus, my Lord, paid His blood as a
   price for me! It is a high honor to our poor fallen race that man is
   the only redeemed creature in the universe! He, alone, has cost the
   Lord His life! Rebellious angels kept not their first estate--they are
   left to their doom and no price has ever been paid for them. Other
   angels, sustained by God's power, still keep their high position in His
   sacred courts, but they are not redeemed by blood. In them there is an
   exhibition of Divine wisdom, power and goodness, but there is no
   display of Free Grace and dying love.

   Only man stands in this respect--nowhere else is the blood-mark--the
   blood-mark of the Son of God! We, alone, are the flock of God which He
   has redeemed with His own blood! Therefore man cost God more than the
   whole universe besides. The Lord could speak worlds into existence. He
   could mold ponderous orbs as one rolls clay between His palms, or
   create constellations as the smith strikes off sparks from the
   anvil--but to erect the new creation of redeemed men, God must endure
   the loss of His own Son--resign His Beloved to death! And in the Person
   of the Only-Begotten, He must ransom men by His own sufferings! I may
   not venture, now, to describe the agonies of the Incarnate God, but all
   these were necessary to redeem man. The Lord has given more than
   Ethiopia or Seba for us, for He has given Himself!

   Think of yourself, my dear Friend, (if, indeed, you have believed in
   Christ), as being a singularity in the realm of beings, a special
   wonder in the creation! You, alone, can say, "I know that my Redeemer
   lives." Neither in the earth nor in the stars, however they may be
   peopled, nor in yonder golden streets, are there any beings except men
   who have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the
   Lamb. We are the costliest of creatures! We are dearest to God, for He
   has spent most upon us and made us the choice objects of His heavenly
   expenditure. This work of Redemption is a very marvelous one, for the
   more one tries to study it, the more its many-sidedness appears.

   In what respects and under what aspects have we been ransomed? Time
   would fail me to recount them all. We have been redeemed, we know, in
   reference to Divine Justice. We had violated God's Law and, therefore,
   there was a punishment to be exacted from us. This punishment the Lord
   Jesus has endured in our place. "The Lord has made to meet on Him the
   iniquities of us all." "He was wounded for our transgressions, He was
   bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him
   and with His stripes we are healed." We are justified, or reckoned as
   just through the Redemption which is in Christ Jesus! Our great
   Redeemer has done, for the honor of the Law, more than all of us put
   together could have done and this stands as a ransom for us--so that we
   may go free because He has suffered in our place whatever was due from
   us to the Law of God.

   This is a blessed aspect of Redemption and one which we hope to always
   keep prominent in our thoughts and in our teaching. "Christ has
   redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us: for
   it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree." May the Holy
   Spirit teach us to value this great Redemption! Furthermore, we are
   redeemed from the power of evil, even as the Holy Spirit says in the
   Epistle to Titus, "He gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from
   all iniquity and purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good
   works." This Redemption may be said to be not so much Redemption by
   price as by power, yet even in this, there are signs of price, for the
   Apostle says, "He gave Himself for us."

   It is true that no price was paid to Satan--that is not to be imagined
   for an instant! We were never the devil's rightful possession and,
   therefore, he is compelled to let go of his captives neither for price
   or reward. We have been brought out from under the power of evil even
   as Israel was brought out from under the tyranny of Pharaoh. No
   redemption money was paid to the Egyptian king, but the Lord redeemed
   His people with a high hand and a stretched out arm--it was a case of
   redemption by power and yet that smear of blood made by the hyssop on
   the lintel and the two side posts still indicated that price went hand
   in hand with power and the blood of Atonement was needed as well as the
   rod of Omnipotence.

   In our deliverance from evil it is not only by the power of the Holy
   Spirit that we are delivered, but He applies the blood as a cleansing
   power. The Lord Jesus is "made unto us sanctification and redemption."
   Of those who conquer sin and Satan it is said, "they overcame by the
   blood of the Lamb." Grace breaks the yoke from off the neck of the
   Believer,

   but the finger of delivering Grace is dipped in blood and leaves
   Redemption's token wherever it comes. Do you see it? Know you not that
   you are not your own--the price paid in Gethsemane and Calvary has set
   you apart? Another phase of this Redemption which we do not often think
   of seems to me to be suggested by the text. There was a time, Brothers
   and Sisters, when we thought ourselves to be our own.

   Now, says my text, "You are not your own." "Because you are 'bought
   with a price.'" Bought from whom? May I not fairly say that, in one
   sense, you were bought from yourselves? Where else is the force of the
   expression, "You are not your own." Through the Redemption which is in
   Christ Jesus, a compensation has been given to you for yourselves, so
   that your rights to yourselves are now the property of your Lord Jesus!
   That independence and liberty which you once delighted in is now
   surrendered. You said, "Our lips are our own--who is Lord over us? Who
   is the Lord that we should obey His voice? As for us, we will be free
   and do according to our own wills!" But the matchless Ransom has been
   paid and all idea of self-will and self-indulgence are trespasses upon
   the enclosed possession of the Redeemer.

   Our vested interest in ourselves, though it never was a true property
   at all, is once and for all surrendered to Him who has laid down His
   life for us! We have received at the Lord's hands a thousand-fold for
   all that we hand over to Him--the price is so great, so altogether
   beyond all computation--that we gladly yield our unworthy selves to be
   the Lord's forever and ever. I shall need you to remember this form of
   redemption and to that end I will set it first among the points to
   which I shall call your attention.

   Dear Brothers and Sisters, let us try, at this time, to feel the force
   of the Truth of God that we are bought with a price and are not our
   own, for it must not remain a dead letter. It ought to affect our
   hearts and influence our lives. I shall try to set it forth to you in a
   series of contrasts which I may compare to the double glasses of a
   stereoscope--they will, I trust, aid you in seeing more clearly and
   feeling more forcibly. We can never be too much affected by this
   important practical Truth of God. O that the Spirit of God would press
   it home upon our hearts and consciences!

   I. First, I see in the text COMPENSATION AND YET GAIN. Compensation is
   intended to make good a loss, but in our case the transfer of ourselves
   from self to Christ is a clear gain. Compensation, then, first--"You
   are not your own: for you are bought with a price." You have
   surrendered, as Believers, your right and property in yourselves. Have
   you made a good bargain? Assuredly you have, for, first of all, you
   live and, had you retained your supposed right to yourself, you would
   have died! He that saves his life in such a sense, by keeping it to
   himself, shall lose it.

   You were, in fact, already dead while you lived, because you were
   living in pleasure and finding that pleasure in yourself. But now the
   Lord has given you a new, high, noble, Divine life. Is not that a
   compensation, indeed, for giving up the groveling life of the flesh? He
   has given you, in addition to life, peace--you are now at rest in
   Jesus. As a Believer, you know that your sins are forgiven for Christ's
   name's sake, that the Father Himself loves you, that you are accepted
   in the Beloved and safe in Jesus' hands! You enjoy great peace--deep,
   lasting, ever-flowing. Is it not much better to have peace and to be
   Christ's than to be like the troubled sea that cannot rest and belong
   to yourself? One drop of sacred peace is an abundant recompense for the
   yielding up of yourself to Jesus.

   In addition to peace, you have joy. Sometimes when it is at flood, your
   happiness is as much as you can bear--you know what it is to be carried
   off your feet by a whirlwind of intense delight when you are musing
   upon your Lord and His love to you and the price paid to win you. Oh,
   the joy, the unutterable blessedness which is the fruit of the Spirit!
   What delights grow on the bitter tree, the cross! No clusters of the
   vine can equal the fruit of Calvary's Cross! I am sure that whatever
   earthly joys you have given up, you are abundantly compensated for them
   all by the joy you find in the purchase price which Christ Jesus gave
   for you. And then you have a grand reversion--a hope which looks across
   the stream of death to a better land--a hope of immortality with
   Christ, of likeness to Him and association with Him and glory with Him
   forever!

   Why, my Friend, if there had been a kingdom to renounce; if there had
   been a world of self-denials and 10,000 pleasant things to be given up,
   you might have been well content to be repaid by such a price! You have
   received for your little, the fullness which is in Christ who is All in
   All--yes, the polluting joys, the dangerous independence, the
   rebellious indulgences of sin at their best and all put together are
   not worthy to be compared with the matchless endowments which your
   Redeemer has bestowed upon you! Today you possess all that the blood of
   Jesus confers and effects and I cannot, in a few words, tell you the
   whole of that treasury of Grace! The price which Jesus paid means
   cleansing--"The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all
   sin."

   Is it not better to be cleansed and to be the Lord's than to be filthy
   and be your own? The blood of Jesus brings us near to God, for we are
   "made near by the blood of Christ." Is it not better to be near to the
   Lord and belong to Jesus than to be in the far-off country with the
   swine and the husks and be your own? The blood has spoken peace--it
   "speaks better things than that of Abel." Is it not better to be God's
   and hear the blood cry, "Peace," than to be your own and to hear a
   terrible sound in your ears of judgment to come? The blood has given
   you entrance into the Most Holy Place, even into the very heart of God!
   And is it not better to be the Lord's beloved and to come close to Him
   and speak with Him as a man speaks with his friend than to be your own
   and to be shut out from God and from the Glory of His Presence? Until
   the blood is sprinkled, no man may dare to approach the thrice holy
   God, but that once done, we have access with boldness! Is not this a
   joy? If any complain that a Christian's life is a life of self-denial
   as, indeed, sometimes it is, yet the compensations are incalculably
   rich, for in the blood of Jesus we have had given to us 10,000 times
   over and above all that we ever lost for Christ's sake.

   So far compensation. But then we must not forget that the supposed loss
   is an actual gain! It is a fine business when a man is compensated for
   a loss and yet the loss, itself, becomes an advantage to him. Yet most
   emphatically this has been our case, for anything that we have lost for
   Christ's sake, we may truly count as clear gain. We have only lost that
   which dishonored, injured and enslaved us. Blessed loss! What were we
   without Christ? We were the slaves of self! But if set free from self,
   we are, indeed, set free from a worse than Egyptian bondage whose wage
   is death! It was inevitable that we must have some master or other, but
   all our former masters were tyrants. Now, Brothers and Sisters, we are
   set free from Satan and is not that a gain to be delivered from the
   Prince of the power of the air?

   Once we served the world and it was our lord, but what gain it is to
   feel that we are no longer the servants of men because we are bought
   with a price. Instead of needing that anything should be given to us as
   a recompense for self-surrender, we can reply--We find our joy and our
   delight in being altogether Christ's and the very height of our
   ambition is that, by-and-by, we may live entirely according to the will
   of God! Oh, that this much-desired were fully come, for we shall never
   know perfect liberty until we reach that lofty degree and then we shall
   be ready to step into Glory. The Lord help us in it!

   So much, then, on the first point--the Lord Jesus has, by His blood,
   given us compensation and yet there never was a loss, but an
   unspeakable gain.

   II. Look at the text again and you will see in it HIGH VALUE AND YET
   LOWLINESS--"You are not your own: for you are bought with a price."
   Value is clearly here, for we are bought with an immense price. How
   great a store ought man to set by himself as before God, for he is a
   purchased possession. God thinks not lightly of man, but esteems him
   sufficiently, in Divine condescension, to buy him with the richest
   price conceivable! He lost the angels and would not pay a penny for
   them--but when man had fallen, He laid down His life to ransom him!
   You, my dear Friend, should have the very lowest view of yourself, but
   yet see how God has exalted you! "What is man, that You are mindful of
   him, O God? And the son of man, that You visit him?"

   Yet He does visit him. He has visited him so as to take his nature into
   union with the Divine! More than that, He visited him so as to redeem
   him with pangs and unutterable anguish. If you want to know the value
   of yourself, see Christ upon the Cross and make a note of His wounds.
   You are not a thing to be trifled with. Do not reckon so cheaply of
   yourself as to stoop to become a mere money-grubber or earthworm! You
   are worth more than that! Do not fancy that you ever can truly be
   yourself while you are living for any human objective or any earthly
   aim--you are too precious to waste yourself on fading flowers.

   In the first place, you are a being of God's making. In His own image,
   remember, He made you and nothing but sin could spoil you--and now you
   have been bought and, therefore, have become a costly thing--more
   costly than a mere creation. In the Lord's house you are not a vessel
   of dishonor, a broken crock to be flung on the dunghill and another
   obtained in your place--you are a vessel of honor fit for the Master's
   use since He has paid so dearly for you. "You were not redeemed with
   corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation;
   but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and
   without spot." There is a sanctity about a blood-bought man or woman of
   the highest degree--the Lord has purchased Him with His life!

   A sanctity surrounds even these frail bodies, for the Apostle is
   speaking about them in the text now before us. Let me read what he says
   upon them--"What? Don't you know that your body is the temple of the
   Holy Spirit which is in you,

   which you have of God and you are not your own?" Never, therefore, give
   up your body to idleness, drunkenness, or any form of uncleanness. Paul
   speaks especially of fornication as a thing not to be thought of among
   the saints because the body has been valued by God at a great price and
   purchased accordingly. And it must not, therefore, be defiled by even
   an impure conversation. Though Paul, in another sense, called it a
   "vile body," yet it cannot be vile in all respects, for even now it is
   a sacred thing, the shrine of the eternal Spirit!

   We ought to value the very dust of the departed saint. It little
   matters what becomes of a dead body, yet would I have it laid
   reverently in its last resting place and let its bones be undisturbed
   until the trumpet of the archangel shall sound, for every atom of a
   Believer's body has been redeemed with the blood of Jesus Christ, as
   well as His soul and spirit! Yes, his entire manhood has been purchased
   by Christ Jesus. I want you, then, to think of yourselves, you
   Believers, as precious things! The Lord says to each one of His own
   beloved, "Since you were precious in My sight, you have been honorable
   and I have loved you." You are "the precious sons of Zion, comparable
   to fine gold." Use yourselves only for honorable purposes, for God puts
   honor upon you.

   Now look at the other side of the picture. You are precious, but you
   must yet be lowly, for whatever value there is about you, you do not
   belong to yourself. "You are not your own." Though precious enough to
   have been bought with a price, yet none of the preciousness is yours.
   Believers, you are the goods and chattels of Christ--as you were once
   sold under sin, so are you now "bought with a price." We are done with
   slavery of men, I hope, though in a few countries it ignominiously
   lingers as a crime on which society has laid its ban. But the blessed
   bondage of belonging to Christ I pray that it may be extended all over
   the world! "I bear in my body," said Paul, "the marks of the Lord
   Jesus," as if he had been branded with Christ's name, as sheep and
   cattle often bear the mark of their owner.

   I think he alluded to the scars which had been left by the scourges, or
   perhaps to the watermark of Baptism which he had received in his entire
   body--in which some of us greatly rejoice because it is the reminder of
   our being dead with Christ and buried with Him. Never can the fact of
   our immersion into the sacred name be reversed! Only once and that to
   last forever, we are buried with Christ in Baptism unto death! Into His
   name have we been plunged, that we may be His forever and no more our
   own. A man cannot be proud of himself, however he knows his value, when
   He perceives that not a hair on his head or a finger of his hands
   belongs to himself.

   In true Christian life not a pulse beats for ourselves, not a breath is
   breathed for ourselves, not a single part of the complex machinery of
   our body or of our mind or soul remains our own--we are to use all for
   Christ, for we are bought and sold properties--taken right away from
   ourselves and owned by Christ by an everlasting tenure as "a purchased
   possession." I wish I could get into the mind of all here the thought
   which burdens my own heart, that we should esteem ourselves as
   blood-bought men, as being sacred things, as holy as the golden
   candlestick, or as the golden table of the show-bread and yet think of
   ourselves as being the very least and lowest in the Lord's house
   because we are not at all our own. Our honor lies in our Owner!

   God forbid that we should glory in anything except that we belong to
   Christ! Paul cried, "Whose I am and whom I serve!" And this we, too,
   will say with hearty exultation! We will walk with holy boldness as the
   Lord's own, but yet with deep humility as not our own.

   III. Thoughtfully let us consider another contrast--"You are not your
   own: for you are bought with a price." This

   brings before my mind SECURITY AND YET WATCHFULNESS. First, security.
   You will not be lost, for He who

   owns you is able to keep you. If you were to perish, who would be the
   loser? Why, He to whom you belong and "you are not your own," you
   belong to Christ! My hope of being preserved to the end lies in this
   fact, that Jesus Christ paid far too much for me ever to let me go.
   Each Believer cost Him His heart's blood! Stand in Gethsemane and hear
   His groans! Then draw near and mark His bloody sweat and tell me--will
   He lose a soul for whom He suffered like this?

   Look at Him hanging on the tree, tortured, mocked, burdened with an
   awful load and then beclouded with the eclipse of His Father's face! Do
   you think He suffered all that and yet will permit those for whom He
   endured it to be cast into Hell? He will be a greater loser than I
   shall if I perish, for He will lose what cost Him His life! Surely He
   will never do that. Here is your security--you are the Lord's portion
   and He will not be robbed of His heritage! We are in a hand that bears
   the scar of the nail! We are hidden in the cleft of a rock--the Rock
   that was riven for us nearly 1,900 years ago! None can pluck us from
   the hand which redeemed us--its pressure is too warm with love and
   strong with might for that.

   Now turn the picture over. Look at the other side of the medal. Here is
   reason for watchfulness. "You are not your own: for you are bought with
   a price." Therefore take great care of yourselves and keep your hearts
   with all diligence, for you are a King's treasure. If a thing is my
   own, I may do what I like with it, but if it is entrusted to my care, I
   must mind how I behave towards it or else I shall be an unfaithful
   steward. Come, come, Friend, you may play with yourself if you like if
   you are your own, but if you belong to Jesus Christ, I charge you by
   the love you bear Him and by the dignity of His sacred Character and by
   His death--the price He gave for you--do not pollute or degrade
   yourself! You are not your own, therefore permit no damage to come to
   your Lord's estate lest He call you to account.

   The prodigal away in the far country may live just as he likes if he is
   his own, for the citizens of that country and their swine care nothing
   about how he behaves. Poor wretch that he is, he may destroy himself if
   he wills--on his own head shall come the loss--nobody will grieve over
   a fool and a spendthrift. But you and I are not in that condition! We
   have been brought home and are our Father's own children and we must
   behave ourselves according to the law of His house and please Him in
   all things. We have no rights of property in ourselves, now that Christ
   has purchased u, and it is our solemn duty to act towards ourselves as
   husbandmen act towards a vineyard, the fruits of which are not to be
   eaten by themselves, but by their lord.

   Let us preserve each cluster of the heart's vine for the King to whom
   it belongs and trim each walk and train each flower of the soul's
   garden according to His pleasure. See to it, then, that you waste not
   and spoil not the royal estate. You are safe in the Lord's hands,
   therefore rejoice! But mind you take the other side of the Truth and
   watch so as to keep your garments white by walking close to God, for
   "you are not your own: you are bought with a price."

   IV. A fourth contrast, well worthy to be worked out in your private
   meditations, is CONSECRATION AND YET PERFECT LIBERTY. "You are not your
   own: for you are bought with a price"--there is consecration. You are,
   today, to dedicate yourself wholly and entirely to the Lord because you
   are not partly redeemed, but wholly redeemed. Do you make any provision
   for the flesh, dear Friend? Do you keep back any faculty you possess
   from Christ? Is not this a robbery of your Lord? How would you like to
   think of that particular reservation as being unredeemed? Would you be
   content to believe that no blood of Christ has ever fallen to redeem
   that part of you?

   Which portion is it which is to be unconsecrated? Is it the body that
   you would pamper and indulge? What? Have you an unredeemed body, then?
   Are you satisfied that it should be eaten of the worm and never rise
   from the dust? Or do you give to Christ your loving heart, but reserve
   your thinking mind to yourself and say, "I will invent my own beliefs
   and not yield my judgment to the dicta of Revelation"? What? My Friend,
   have you, then, an unredeemed intellect? What is to become of it in
   that day when only those things shall be gathered into Heaven which
   have been bought with blood and owned by Christ? In that day when He
   makes up His jewels, He will not put another man's goods among them!

   Do not keep back from Christ even your second-class powers. Withhold
   not your voice, but sing for Jesus, or speak for Him if you can! Write
   for Jesus, paint for Jesus, yes, make and mend garments for His sake!
   Do not keep back from Christ any minor power that you possess, but ask
   God to enable you to consecrate the skill of your fingers to Him as
   well as the force of your arms, for even your least members are bought
   with a price. Your time is included in the purchase, for there is never
   a moment when you are unredeemed! Some people think, perhaps, that they
   are off duty now and then--let me ask them, "Are you ever off the roll
   of Redemption? Is there one St. Monday in the week in which you are an
   unredeemed man and may be your own or the devil's? Suppose you die that
   day? What then?"

   As this consecration holds good for all times, so in all manner of
   ways. You are consecrated to Christ to do whatever you can do to His
   Glory--to suffer whatever you can suffer as He lays it upon you and,
   above all, to be, as well as to do, and to suffer--to be forever the
   Lord's! There is a great deal in actually being Christ's, even when you
   are not actively engaged--when you are neither praying, nor singing,
   nor working, but, as it were, standing still--it is well to be as the
   sweet flowers in the garden which exhale the perfume of their innermost
   hearts in silent surrender to the passing gales. O that we may be full
   of Grace and may the wind of the Divine Spirit scatter abroad the
   sweetnesses of our inner life, even when we are scarcely conscious of
   it!

   But then, there is with this, a perfect liberty. I believe that to be
   consecrated to Christ is when we come to the bottom of things, the sure
   way to give to all the faculties of our nature the fullest possible
   play. Vice is the indulgence of the passions. True. Therefore some
   think it joy, but if all the passions of a man of every sort were to be
   exercised in their right harmony and proportion, as they would have
   been had he remained in his first estate, then perfect virtue and not
   vice,

   would have been the result--and in that virtue manhood would have found
   a delightful liberty. The propensities of our nature as nature--not as
   fallen nature--will have their right indulgence when they acknowledge a
   complete subservience to the will and Law of God. Liberty to sin is
   slavery, liberty from sin is freedom!

   There is no liberty to a man like that of being under Law to God. If we
   are encased within the compass of the Law, we are no more restricted
   than a bird which is imprisoned within the boundless expanse of air, or
   a fish which is shut in by the ocean! Obedience to Christ is our
   element! The element of a truly renewed man is holiness and, therefore,
   when you and I shall become perfectly consecrated to Christ, so as to
   live only for Him, we shall have reached that way of living which God
   designed us to follow wherein we shall be perfectly filled with
   happiness.

   Do not think, therefore, that the more a Christian you become, the more
   you will feel of restriction and bond. Say, rather, that you will
   rejoice more in the freedom of such as good men, alone, can understand.
   The fact is that self-denial, itself, will become no self-denial, but a
   supreme joy when once the heart is perfectly loyal to its Lord!

   V. To close, I will mention a fifth pair of contrasts--SUBMISSION AND
   EXPECTANCY. These are both suggested by my text. Submission--"You are
   not your own" and, therefore, God has a right to do whatever He wills
   with you. We cannot tell what He may do with us, yet, but if we must
   suffer pain week after week upon our bed, He has a right to lay us
   there and chasten us in every limb. If the Lord says, "Go into your
   room and cough all the winter through and then melt away with decline,"
   we must bow before His decree, remembering these words, "You are not
   your own." Or, if He says, "Come down from your position of comfort
   into hard work and poverty," again you must remember, "you are not your
   own."

   Or if He says, "Migrate across the seas. Go to a new country, cut every
   tie and break the fondest connections," you must cheerfully obey, for,
   "you are not your own." If the call of duty should be, "Go, preach the
   Gospel among the heathen! Go and die among them--find a grave where
   malaria shortens life, or cruelty brings sudden death"--you must go
   without question, for, "you are not your own." Ours is not to raise
   questions or debates, for those can only be legitimate among persons
   who are their own--

   "Ours not to reason why: Ours but to do and die,"

   for we are not our own! Submission, absolute submission, is the
   rightful position of the blood-bought!

   Side by side with that comes expectancy. I could not do much for myself
   if I were my own, but if I am Christ's, I expect that He will do great
   things for me. Do you see those two boys? Neither can do much for
   himself, but one of them has great expectations. And why? Because he
   has a kind and wealthy father, of whom he expects great things. He
   says, "I am my father's son and he will take care of me." It is the
   same with us! Our great Owner's goodness and power have raised our
   expectations! Look at this body of mine--it must decay and become mere
   dust--but my Lord has bought it and you can be sure He did not purchase
   it to let it end in corruption! It is not my own, therefore I feel sure
   that He who owns it, will lift it up, again, in nobler form than it now
   wears and make it bright and glistening like His own, not liable to
   pain, or sickness, or decay.

   I know He will! If this body were only mine, I should expect there
   would be an end of it when the gravedigger hides it in the earth. But
   if it is my Lord's, since He has paid so much for it, He must have some
   grand intention concerning it! He sees in this body the raw material
   out of which His Grace and power can make something that shall glorify
   Himself. Is there not a guarantee for great expectations in our
   belonging to Christ? We are not our own! Then these minds of ours--
   depend upon it He will enlarge them! He will increase our mental
   caliber and make His property more worthy of its Owner. You say, dear
   Brother, "I shall never be much of a man. I have but small capacity for
   learning." Well, what you have belongs to Christ and He will sanctify
   your talents and increase them and give you wisdom to use them for His
   honor!

   You do not know what you may yet become. You will know more after you
   have been in Heaven five minutes than all the doctors of divinity on
   earth! For there you shall know even as you are known. You shall know
   Christ and see Him and rejoice in Him beyond all that you can now
   conceive. You are not your own, but He who owns you means to make
   something out of you--He bought you at too great a price to let you run
   to waste. As for your entire being, rest assured that He intends to
   reflect His own Glory by means of it throughout eternity. I never knew
   Christ act unwisely, yet, and though sometimes it seems to me as though
   I could have forbidden the Cross and His Sacrifice--as though His death

   were too dear a price to redeem such insignificant beings as we
   are--yet He must have seen in our poor, fallen nature, in its very sin
   and misery, room for His Grace, room for His power and, therefore, the
   opportunity for a grand display of His power and love to the amazement
   of angels and principalities and powers throughout eternity!

   At any rate, a piece of clay that lies in the pit, all its own, has no
   destiny before it until it has been purchased by the potter and beaten
   and prepared. And when it feels itself revolving on the wheel, it has
   just reason to believe that it will bear a useful part in time to come.
   It might say, if it could speak, "I am not my own lump of clay! I have
   been bought with a great price and, therefore, something is to be made
   of me! It does not yet appear what I shall be, but when he that
   fashions, has finished me, I shall, no doubt, be worthy of the hand
   that has worked this upon me." Raise your expectations as high as you
   will--God means to do for you exceedingly above what you can ask or
   even think! According to the riches of His Glory in Christ Jesus He
   will show the greatness of His power in you that believe in Jesus
   Christ! Blessed are the men, then, of whom it is true, "You are not
   your own: for you are bought with a price."

   Now, I finish with this question--"Are you your own, dear Hearer?" I
   can imagine some sitting here saying, "Of course I am! I do not believe
   in surrendering myself to God." Well, then, if you are your own, you
   will go to your own place and where your own place is read the Word of
   God and discover! There shall you find that those who know not God
   shall be driven from His Presence! If they are their own, they must be
   their own comforters and their own helpers, but they shall be driven
   far off from God forevermore! Are you anxious to be saved, my dear
   Hearer? Then the way of salvation is that you believe in Jesus
   Christ--and it is an essential part of that believing that you
   surrender yourself to Christ.

   If He will save you, shall He have you to be His possession? If He will
   buy you, will you be His? If He will redeem you, will you confess that
   you are not your own? Many a man is unable to find peace because he
   wants to be independent and demands to have his own will and way.
   Surrender! That is a necessary exhortation to every revolted one who
   would be restored. Surrender! Surrender at discretion! God cannot deal
   with rebels while they carry their weapons in their hands. Down with
   your weapons! Cry to Him, "Lord, I am dying, starving, perishing! Wrath
   is upon me! Only let me live and be cleansed and I will be Yours
   forever, as Your Grace shall help me."

   He will accept you! He does accept you, now, if that is the utterance
   of your heart! And you, too, may go away and sing--

   "I am Yours and Yours alone, This I gladly, fully own." God grant it,
   for Jesus' sake. Amen.

The Glories of Forgiving Grace

   (No. 1555)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, AUGUST 29, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins,
   according to the riches of His Grace." Ephesians 1:7.

   LAST Sunday morning the subject was redemption, "You are not your own:
   you are bought with a price." The sequel to redemption is pardon--the
   text gives us that doctrine, for it tells us that redemption through
   the blood of Jesus involves the forgiveness of sins. Our subject, at
   this time, shall be the forgiveness of sin, the measure, mode, medium
   and manifestation of it as set forth in the words before us. May the
   Holy Spirit sweetly open up to us the glories of our sin-forgiving God
   and cause us to exult in the riches of His Grace.

   Beloved Friends, no one can say that we have before us a theme which is
   unpractical, speculative and fanciful! No one will be able to charge
   the preacher with discoursing upon a subject with which his hearers
   have little or nothing to do, or wandering into barren fancies which
   cannot affect their actual lives. It is true that some sermons are
   barely human and might as well have been addressed to the inhabitants
   of Jupiter or Saturn as to ourselves, but such shall not be the case
   with our discourse. We have no hairlines of metaphysical subtlety
   before us--our theme runs parallel with the beaten track of everyday
   life.

   Sin is, alas, too familiar with us. We have all committed it; the slime
   of the serpent has been upon us; we are still affected by it. As an
   adder in the path, it bites at our heels and it will be our daily
   trial, like the fiery serpents in the wilderness, till we enter the
   promised rest. Sin, as a thing of the past, cannot be forgotten. Was
   there ever a more sore bondage than that with which made us serve it
   with rigor? Sin, as a matter of affliction for the present, is not to
   be ignored--was there ever a sterner fight than we have to wage against
   evil outside and within? Sin, as a danger still ahead, must not be
   overlooked--were there ever rocks or quicksand more terrible to the
   mariner than temptations to sin which yet lie before us on our voyage
   to Heaven? Sin is always around us! Where shall we hasten to escape
   from its presence? If in holy communion we climb to Pisgah's top, we
   stumble even in view of Canaan and slip upon our high places! And if we
   descend into the lowest deeps, like David, till all God's waves and
   billows have gone over us, our despondency and unbelief cause us to sin
   amid our humiliations! Should I take the wings of the morning and fly
   unto the uttermost parts of the sea, unless I could escape from myself,
   even there would sin follow me and its hand would smite me to my sore
   wounding.

   Nothing can be more practical than the doctrine which deals with sin
   and its removal and no news can be more pleasant than the tidings of
   remission! Why, the very sound of that word, "Forgiveness of sins" is a
   joy forever! No marriage bell has more music in its notes. To the
   guilty, forgiveness is a tone of joy which their jaded ears are able to
   hear without strain. It ministers refreshment to the weary heart. High
   joys and rare delights are apt to send forth raised notes which
   terrified consciences cannot endure--their very sweetness is sharp and
   distressing to the sorrowful--and their harmony causes a deeper discord
   in the broken heart!

   But forgiveness has a soft, silver sound, mellow and tender and when
   man's ears are stunned with the thunder and the terror of the wrath to
   come, then he is charmed to listen to its soothing melody. The gentle
   love whispers of Free Grace and dying love and pardons bought with
   blood are as Heaven's own sonnets to troubled souls! It is my earnest
   desire, dear Friends, that many, this morning, may come to believe in
   the joyful doctrine of the forgiveness of sins! It is an article in the
   creed, but I want it to be a substantive in your lives. Most men say
   that they believe it, but their belief is often nominal and a nominal
   faith, like nominal wealth, only makes the absence of the reality the
   more deplorable.

   In two instances there is clearly no faith in forgiven sin. The first
   is in the case of those who have never felt that they are sinful. How
   can he who does not believe in the existence of sin, believe in the
   forgiveness of it? His whole confession on that matter belongs to the
   region of fiction. If sin is not a terrible fact to you, pardon will
   never be more than a no-

   tion. A second class of persons who do not believe in forgiveness are
   those who know the guilt of sin but are not yet able to believe in the
   Lord Jesus for the remission of their transgressions. They need to be
   admonished as Luther was by the godly old monk. When he was greatly
   distressed under conviction of his guilt, the aged man said, "Did you
   not say this morning in the creed, 'I believe in the forgiveness of
   sin'?"

   Luther, like many more, had repeated those words, but had never grasped
   their meaning. Oh, my dear Hearers, do not be theoretical Believers!
   You believe in sin, believe, also in its pardon! Let the one be as much
   a Truth of God as the other. You believe in the punishment of sin in
   the case of the impenitent, be equally sure of the pardon of sin to
   Believers! You believe in the guilt of your own personal sin, believe,
   also, in the power of Jesus, at this moment, to blot out all your
   transgressions and, lo, they shall vanish as a cloud which is driven
   before the north wind! Forgiveness in Christ Jesus accepted by faith is
   now to be enjoyed and, with it, perfect rest and peace of heart. God
   grant it to you at this present moment--then shall my theme be marrow
   and fatness to you.

   According to our text forgiveness of sins is a matter of Divine Grace
   and yet it is connected with the price paid by our Redeemer. We spoke
   last Sunday morning of a price being paid and here the text says, "In
   whom we have redemption through His blood." But the fact of Christ
   having paid a price and having satisfied justice does not remove the
   pardon of sin out of the region of pure Grace. Because justice is
   satisfied we are not, therefore, to say that mercy is excluded. I
   cannot, at this time, go into the details to explain how the facts
   stand, but so it is according to the word of Revelation, that, albeit
   the salvation of a sinner is conducted upon principles which are as
   just as his condemnation, yet at the same time the forgiveness of a
   sinner is an act of gratuitous favor on the part of God.

   As the giving of Jesus Christ, by whom justice is satisfied, was an act
   of free favor on the part of God, so the giving of the pardon which
   comes through Jesus Christ is, in the same manner, a matter of absolute
   Grace and by no means of debt or obligation. Do not, therefore,
   whenever you speak of our Lord's satisfaction which He made to justice,
   think that justice has eclipsed mercy. Or, on the other hand, whenever
   you speak of the Grace of God in pardoning sin, do not imagine that
   mercy has blinded the eyes of justice, for it is a part of the
   Christian faith that in the death of Christ, justice shines out
   full-orbed like the sun at midday while mercy is glorified after a like
   fashion.

   God is just and yet the Justifier of him that believes. Where sin
   abounded, Grace does much more abound! Justice is not forgotten, but
   Grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life. Transgression,
   iniquity and sin are put away by the All-Merciful according to the
   riches of His Grace. Our text speaks of, "the forgiveness of sins
   according to the riches of His Grace," and from it we learn the measure
   of forgiveness, the manner of it and the manifestations of it. O for
   heavenly light while we view this grand Truth of God! Illuminate us, O
   Spirit of all Grace!

   I. From the text we learn THE MEASURE OF FORGIVENESS. Hear this, you
   burdened souls, you self-condemned spirits, you that have shut
   yourselves out from hope of mercy--hear me earnestly, I pray you, that
   your souls may live! It may be while I am speaking to you your minds
   will be quieted and you will find the key which will unlock every door
   in Doubting Castle and you will be set at liberty from Giant Despair!
   Observe, then, that the measure of forgiveness is the riches of God's
   Grace and this statement leads us to observe that it is not the
   character or person of the offender which is the measure of mercy, but
   the Character of the offended One! Is there not rich consolation in
   this undoubted fact?

   The pardon to be hoped for is not to be measured by you and what you
   are, but by God and what He is! In matters of offense and forgiveness,
   the rule almost always holds good that pardon becomes likely or
   unlikely, easy or difficult, not so much according to the offense as
   according to the character of the person offended. One man will forgive
   a grievous wrong while another will not overlook a wry word. Take an
   instance from English history--John had most villainously treated his
   brother, Richard, in his absence. Was it likely that when he of the
   lion's heart came home, he would pass over his brother's grievous
   offense?

   If you look at John, villain that he was, it was most unlikely that he
   should be forgiven. But then, if you consider the brave, high-souled
   Richard, the very flower of chivalry, you expect a generous deed. Base
   as John was, he was likely to be forgiven because Richard was so free
   of heart and, accordingly, pardon was right royally given by the
   great-hearted monarch. Had John been only half as guilty--if his
   brother Richard had been like he was, Richard would have made him lay
   his neck on the block. If John had been Richard and Richard had been
   John, no matter how small the offense, there would have been no
   likelihood of pardon at all! So is it in all matters of transgression
   and pardon. You must take the offense somewhat into account, it is
   true, but not one-half as much as the character of the person who has
   been offended.

   Suppose I were asked, at this present time, to reconcile two persons
   who are at enmity--if the one who evidently had been injured was one of
   certain Brethren around me whose forgiving spirits I have long relied
   upon, I should feel my task to be easy--whatever the offense might have
   been. But I know some others about whom I would say, "I don't know. I
   am afraid I shall not get on the right side of them. I shall have to
   approach them very carefully. However small the offense, it will be
   hard to remove their anger." I know certain persons of old--they are
   quick-tempered and ready to be aggrieved for small reasons and they are
   slow in burning out, having fine memories for an affront. It is hard to
   get a forgiving word out of such sour spirits. You see, the nature of a
   pardon materially depends upon the character of the pardoner.

   Let us establish this fact and then see what light it throws upon the
   probability of pardon to any of you who are seeking it. With whom are
   you dealing? You have offended--who is He whom you have offended? Is it
   One whose anger is quickly awakened? No, the Lord is long-suffering and
   exceedingly patient. Forty years was He grieved with one generation and
   many a time did He pity them and remove His wrath from them. Is He one
   who is hard to satisfy and not easily persuaded to forgive? No, the
   choirs of the Temple of old chanted, as one of His sweetest praises,
   the oft-repeated words, "His mercy endures forever." Again and again
   they answered one to another, "His mercy endures forever."

   If the pardon were to be according to your character, you would never
   be pardoned at all! If it were to be measured according to your
   offense, you would never be forgiven! But since the probability of
   pardon lies in the Character of God, then, O guilty one, self-condemned
   one, take heart and come to your Father's feet and say, "Father,
   forgive me, for I have sinned." Look into the face of God and see if He
   is not ready to forgive! Do you tell me that you dare not even think of
   the face of your offended God? Then I ask you to look into the face of
   Jesus Christ, for in His loving Countenance shines all the brightness
   of the Father's Glory. Is it possible for you to look at the Lord Jesus
   and doubt His willingness to forgive? He whose eyes wept over a guilty
   city? He whose hands were weary with incessantly doing good to those
   who despised Him? He who gave His feet to the cruel nails for His
   adversaries and who, at last, poured out the life-floods of His heart
   for those that mocked Him? He must be willing to forgive! The measure
   of forgiveness, then, lies in the riches of Divine Grace and this may
   encourage the chief of sinners to expect mercy.

   Again, since the forgiveness of sins is "according to the riches of His
   Grace," then it is not according to our conceptions of God's mercy, but
   according to that mercy, itself, and the riches of it. We conceive
   harsh things of God at times. We measure His corn with our bushel. We
   feel that He cannot pass by this and that crime, but that in certain
   points His Grace may be vanquished by human wickedness. Our ideas of
   God's mercy are narrow and we think Him to be altogether such as we
   are! Listen, then--"My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are My
   ways your ways, says the Lord; for as the heavens are higher than the
   earth, so are My ways higher than your ways and My thoughts than your
   thoughts."

   God's love is not to be measured by a mercer's yard, nor His mercy to
   be weighed in the balances of the merchant! He has riches of Grace
   surpassing all the wealth which the imagination could ascribe to Him
   whose name is Love. When He gave His dear Son, His other Self, that He
   might bleed and die, He gave us proof that there was no penury of love
   in the coffers of His heart. "He that spared not His own Son, but
   freely delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also
   freely give us all things?" The measure of mercy, then, is not our
   conception of God, but God as He really is--and who is he that can tell
   us how large is His love, how wide is His Grace, how high is His
   goodness, how deep is His favor?

   I would have you come, poor Sinner, to God as to a deep abyss into
   which your sins can be cast and never heard of again! I would have you
   come to God in Christ as to One who is able, with a glance of His eyes,
   to make your sin dissolve like snow in the summer's sun and vanish
   utterly, so that if it is searched for, it shall not be found! Yes, it
   shall not be, says the Lord. Is there not a fountain in this Truth of
   God overflowing with comfort to the most cast down one--to the one
   whose bleeding heart is smarting under the lash of an angry conscience?
   I think if I had heard this Truth of God plainly stated years ago I
   would not have remained so long in bondage, but I would have risen to
   my feet and have run to the Savior and have found peace at once.

   If, again, the measure of mercy is, "according to the riches of His
   Grace," then no limit to pardon can be set by the amount of human sin
   which can be forgiven. Sin is no trifle and yet pardon is no
   impossibility. Nobody can measure the greatness of the guilt of a
   single sin--it is a world of iniquity. People talk of little sins, but
   there are no such things. The least rebellion against God is an
   intensely great evil. Yet there are degrees of sinning and one offense
   may be greater than another and one man's offenses may be far more rank
   and evil than those of his neighbors. If it is possible that one of my
   hearers has committed all the grosser sins--has heaped them up, has
   raked the kennels for them, has committed crimes in

   a way scarcely to be spoken of, has committed them again and again
   until the amount of his sins has become well-near incalculable--yet
   this does not render his forgiveness impossible!

   If there is one here who has gone to such an extreme of sin that he
   must set himself apart as being above all ordinary sinners, worthy of a
   special place in Hell, worthy of a red-hot bolt from the right hand of
   the avenging God--yet pardon may be granted him! Hear me, O my Friend!
   You have not gone beyond the power of God to pardon you, for the
   measure of His pardon is "according to the riches of His Grace!" And He
   does not say that He stops short here or there by reason of excessive
   vileness on the transgressor's part. "All manner of sin and of
   blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men."

   There is a sin against the Holy Spirit which shall never be forgiven,
   but that is unpardonable only for this reason-- that where once it is
   committed the man never seeks forgiveness, nor desires it--that sin
   kills his conscience, for it is a sin which is unto death and the
   sinner, therefore, goes gaily down to destruction, never seeking
   forgiveness. If you seek mercy, be you who you may, you shall have it
   if you will believe in Christ Jesus! If all the sins of all mankind
   were heaped upon you--if you sought mercy by confession of sin and
   faith in Christ--you would not be denied, but your sin would be blotted
   out "according to the riches of His Grace!"

   Another comfortable conclusion follows from this--no limit is set to
   the time in which a man has sinned so as to bind the reach of Grace by
   the lapse of years. Our text does not say that there is forgiveness of
   sins according to such-and-such a time of life, but "according to the
   riches of His Grace." It is a blessed thing to come to God when you are
   young, a thing to sing of throughout the rest of your existence. Happy
   day when my young heart first leaped at the sound of the Savior's name!
   But oh, if gray hairs are covering your head and years have plowed
   their furrows on your brow, think not the forgiveness of sin to be
   impossible for you! Though your remaining days are so few that a little
   child may write them and the last of them will soon flicker away into
   darkness, yet if you will come and put your trust in Jesus, your
   transgressions shall vanish and your soul shall be even as a new-born
   child, for Christ makes all things new!

   "According to the riches of His Grace"--this reaches the oldest
   man--this brings hope of mercy to the most aged woman! I would to God I
   could speak familiarly with all unconverted persons who are getting
   into years and tell them not to stand back from Jesus through any fear
   that the past has sealed their doom, for there is forgiveness and
   plenteous redemption! The gate of mercy still stands wide open and if
   you are the oldest sinner that ever came to Christ, then you will be
   one of the special wonders of Heaven! You will be one that they will
   gaze upon with astonishment in Heaven and point you out with pleasure,
   saying, "Here is the oldest sinner that was born again!" I think you
   are more likely to be received than anybody, "according to the riches
   of His Grace."

   Let me draw another inference. If pardon is "according to the riches of
   His Grace," then it is not according to the bitterness of the sorrow
   which has been felt by the sinner. There is a notion abroad that we
   must pass through a period of keen remorse before we can expect to be
   accepted by God. "Yes," says one, "I do not wonder that such a person
   was pardoned, since for years he was ready to destroy himself in his
   despair! He scarcely slept. He forgot to eat. He went about wringing
   his hands in agony." Beware of doting after this fashion! There must be
   sorrow for sin in every true Believer and there will be--but the best
   form of sorrow for sin generally follows forgiveness and does not
   precede it.

   I never hated sin so much as when I knew that God had forgiven me! With
   all my soul do I sometimes sing to myself the choice lines of Mr.
   Monsell--

   "My sins, my sins, my Savior! How sad on You they fall, Seen through
   your gentle patience, I tenfold feel them all. I know they are
   forgiven, But still their pain to me Is all the grief and anguish They
   laid, my Lord, on Thee. My sins, my sins, my Savior! Their guilt I
   never knew Till, with You, in the desert I near Your passion drew. Till
   with You in the garden

   I heard Your pleading prayer, And saw the sweat drops bloody That told
   Your sorrow there."

   "But," says one, "I am so afraid that I can never be forgiven." You
   have no right to entertain such a fear, for that is making God a liar!
   "But I dare not trust Christ." My Hearer, mind what you say on that
   score, for it is a tender point. You ought not to dare to doubt Christ
   and there is no daring in trusting Him. When God sets forth His dear
   Son to be a Propitiation for sin, it is not humility, it is wicked
   pride that makes anyone say, "I dare not trust Him." Who are you to
   raise a question about trusting Jesus, the faithful and true? It is
   black presumption to refuse your confidence to God who cannot lie!

   The Lord Himself bids you come and trust His Son! Do you refuse His
   command? Will you sooner perish than do the Lord Jesus the justice to
   trust Him? "Ah, but surely," says one, "I knew a person who was months
   and years in distress about his sin." I know such a person now. I know
   one who was five years an unbelieving seeker, but he was a fool for
   being so! There was no reason why he should have been in the dark so
   long, for the sun had risen! His eyes were blindfolded by his own
   folly. If he had believed in Jesus Christ right off, he might have had
   the forgiveness of sin at once. Half of that which is put down in
   biographies as the work of the Spirit is the work of the devil and the
   result of unbelief! John Bunyan gives a long story, in "Grace
   Abounding," and I am thankful that he does, but he never meant that we
   were to imitate him in his unbelief and harsh thoughts of God!

   Those hideous doubts and horrible fears were not the work of the Spirit
   of God--they were the work of John Bun-yan's vivid imagination and the
   devil together! They had nothing to do with the pardon of his sin
   except that they hindered him from finding it month after month! Your
   business, poor guilty Sinner, is to believe that mercy is dealt out by
   God to sinners, not according to their despair and remorse, but
   "according to the riches of His Grace!" Where has God commanded us to
   despair? Does He not command us to believe? Where has He ever commanded
   remorse? Does He not bid us hope in His mercy? We are to come to Jesus
   just as we are and trust Him and we shall be forgiven all trespasses in
   a moment by our loving, waiting Father. "He that believes in Him is
   justified from all things, from which he could not be justified by the
   Law of Moses." "He that believes in Him has everlasting life."

   And so let me say that the measure of God's forgiveness is not even the
   strength of a man's faith. The measure of God's forgiveness is
   "according to the riches of His Grace." You, dear Soul, are to come and
   trust in what Jesus Christ did when He bled away His life for
   sinners--and then your pardon shall be measured out to you, not
   according to the greatness and strength of your confidence--but
   according to the immeasurable mercy of the heart of God! You may have
   faith but as a grain of mustard seed. Your faith may only dare to touch
   the garment's hem of the great Savior. You may get no further than to
   say, "He has said, 'him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out,'
   and I do come to Him. If I perish, I will perish trusting Him," and yet
   that faith will save you!

   I would that your faith were stronger. I believe it will be so before
   long, but if it is only as the green blade which timidly springs up
   from the soil in the cold spring and is almost afraid of the biting
   wind--if there is but life in it--if it lives alone upon Christ Jesus,
   it will suffice for salvation! Jesus says to the weak believer as well
   as to the strong saint, "your faith has saved you; go in peace." Your
   sins which are many are all forgiven you if you believe in Jesus, for
   the measure of your forgiveness is not your faith, nor your tears of
   repentance, nor your bitter regrets, nor your sin, nor your conception
   of God's goodness, nor your character, either past or present or
   future! No! It is the forgiveness which is granted from the Lord
   "according to the riches of His Grace."

   I feel half envious of men who can speak with the tongue of eloquence,
   for this theme deserves better speech than mine and yet, if I had the
   tongues of angels I could not set forth to you one half of the comfort
   which is to be found in this charming subject! My bare and unadorned
   style will not ever match the matchless beauty of the Grace which
   stands before you in its own native loveliness! The God of Heaven and
   earth who hates sin, nevertheless loves sinners! He has given His dear
   Son to die for them and upon their accepting His Son as their hope and
   trust He passes by their transgression, iniquity and sin--not according
   to the feeble measure of their conceptions, but--"according to the
   riches of His Grace."

   Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, goodwill towards men!
   Thanks be unto God for such amazing Grace!

   II. In the second place, I am going to spend a little time, as God may
   help me, in speaking upon THE MANNER OF FORGIVENESS. The manner of
   forgiveness is "according to the riches of His Grace." Then I see in
   the mode and man-

   ner of forgiveness, first of all, absolute freeness, "According to the
   riches of His free favor," for that is the meaning of the word,
   "Grace." God forgives none because of payment made by them in any form.
   If we could bring Him mountains of gold and silver, they would be
   nothing to Him--if we bring Him tears in rivers or alms in alps, or
   resolves, vows and promises in countless numbers--all will amount to
   nothing as a bribe for Grace.

   Forgiveness, like love, is unpurchaseable by us. God's pardons are
   absolutely free. He forgives because He chooses to forgive out of sheer
   pity to the sinner, out of clear, unmixed compassion, but with no
   adulteration of anything like bribe or price. Forgiveness is absolutely
   free! Then why should you not have it? Oh, you who have said, "It will
   never come to me"--why not to you? "Oh," you have said, "I am not
   prepared." Why should it not come to you though you are unprepared?
   Isn't preparedness a sort of price? Since it comes freely, why not to
   you? "But I have scarcely thought of it! I dropped in here this morning
   merely to spend an hour"--and why not spend that hour in singing of
   Free Grace and pardoning love? Why not let this be the first hour of
   your true life--the hour in which you begin to live unto God? Pardon is
   absolutely free--"Whoever will, let him take of the water of life
   freely." "According to the riches of His Grace"--this hints a royal
   ease!

   When you and I give away money to the poor, we have to pause and see
   how much is left in our purse. We have to calculate our incomes to see
   whether we may not be spending too much in charity. But those who have
   great riches can give and not calculate! Even so, God, when He grants
   forgiveness, gives it "according to the riches of His Grace." He never
   has to think whether He will have Grace enough left--He will be none
   the richer if He withholds it, none the poorer if He bestows it! There
   is a magnificent ease about the benefactions of God--He scatters the
   largesse of His mercy right and left with unstinted liberality! The
   Roman conquerors, traversing the Via Sacra in triumph, were accustomed
   to scatter gold and silver with both hands as they rode along and the
   eager crowd gathered up the shower of gifts. Our Lord, when He ascended
   on high and led captivity captive, scattered gifts among men with royal
   splendor and munificence.

   So does God pardon sinners as if it were everyday work with Him! His
   goodness flashes on all sides as water from a fountain in full play, or
   as light and heat from the noonday sun. You have not to extract
   forgiveness from a palm fast closed--God is more pleased to pardon than
   we are to be pardoned! When the prodigal son laid his head on his
   father's bosom and his father kissed him, who had the more joy, do you
   think--the son or the father? I know the prodigal's heart overflowed
   with gladness, but then the father's heart was more capacious and when
   he said, "This, my son, was dead and is alive again; was lost and is
   found," there was an incalculable depth of delight in the expression.
   It was the father who called for music and dancing, feasting and
   merriment--I fear the son was hardly so demonstrative in his delight.

   O poor weary Seekers, hear this inspired Word of God and be glad--"He
   delights in mercy." Come home! Come home, poor wanderer! It is harder
   work to you to come home than for your Father to receive you. It is
   more trouble for you to ask for mercy than for God to give it to you!
   It is harder work for you to believe that He can save than it is for
   Him to do it. To Him mercy is pleasant work, the cunning art of His
   right hand which He can never forget. Oh, come and receive the mercy
   which the Lord gives lavishly, according to the wealth of His goodness!
   "According to the riches of His Grace"--that means unquestionable
   fullness. The man who is forgiven of the Lord is not half forgiven, but
   altogether absolved.

   There is a theology which teaches that when a man believes in Jesus
   Christ he is pardoned up to a point, but in the future he may get into
   arrears again and if he does not see to it, he may again be accused and
   summoned before the Judgment Seat. This is not our theology. We believe
   in Him who said, "I give unto My sheep eternal life; and they shall
   never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of My hand." I believe
   that when Jesus Christ died for His people, He did not make Atonement
   for half their sins, but for all of them! And on that day when He said,
   "It is finished," there was a virtual wiping out of all the sins of all
   His redeemed from the book of God's remembrance. Hence His salvation is
   complete and those who have it are altogether delivered from the ruin
   which sin involves!

   If you come to Christ He will grant you deep, full, living, substantial
   pardon, such pardon as will put you among God's children--such pardon
   that God will have no reckonings for past sins with you, no calling of
   you to account at some future time--such pardon that you shall be as
   much accepted as if you had never sinned and God shall love you as
   though your whole life had been spent in His fear! The blood of Jesus
   makes us whiter than snow and absolute innocence cannot be more white
   than that! There shall be no sin left against you to be, in the future,
   quoted to your dismay. Thus

   says the Lord, "In those days and in that time, the iniquity of Israel
   shall be sought for and there shall be none: and the sins of Judah and
   they shall not be found; for I will pardon them whom I reserve." Such a
   mode of pardon is "according to the riches of His Grace."

   Again, the text implies irreversible certainty. "According to the
   riches of His Grace." For God to pardon and then, afterwards to
   condemn, would not be "according to the riches of His Grace." If Her
   Majesty were to issue a free pardon for a criminal and then,
   afterwards, hang him, it would be poor work. It would certainly not be
   according to the riches of her favor! And if you and I get pardon
   through Jesus Christ, we can no more be lost than God can become poor
   in love. Believe in Christ Jesus and get a pardon for your
   transgressions under the sign manual of Jehovah and you are clear
   forever! "There is, therefore, now no condemnation to them that are in
   Christ Jesus." "As far as the east is from the west, so far has He
   removed our transgressions from us"--and how far is that? It is an
   infinite distance and from an infinite distance our sins can never be
   brought back. They are gone! They are blotted out! Drowned like the
   Egyptians in the Red Sea, we shall never see their faces again! That
   pardon must be irreversible which is given "according to the riches of
   His

   Grace."

   Once more, it suggests unfailing renewal. It is "forgiveness of sins
   according to the riches of His Grace." It does not mean forgiveness up
   to a certain point and then, if you sin again, no more forgiveness--but
   daily forgiveness for daily sin--a fresh spring rising for fresh
   thirst. Joseph Hart sings--

   "This fountain from guilt, not only makes pure, And gives, soon as
   felt, infallible cure, But if guilt removed, returns and remains, Its
   power may be proved again and again." We may come to Christ as freely
   today as we did 30 years ago and find ourselves washed white again. We
   may come again with all the accumulated wanderings and backslidings of
   our past years and, just believing as we did at first, we shall find
   our soul, again, set at its first liberty and admitted into its first
   joy! God grant us to know all this in our own souls. I wish I could
   speak as I can sometimes think, or think as the Word of God allows me
   to think. O blessed thought, that you and I, condemned and lost and
   ruined by our guilt, should only need to look to Christ on the Cross
   and, in a moment, should receive pardon, "according to the riches of
   His Grace!"

   All for nothing, all freely given, not given as a sham, but as a
   reality--real pardon for real sin, abiding pardon, everlasting pardon,
   a pardon which retrieves all our loss and adds a charm which unfallen
   spirits cannot know. O the splendor of God! Where does it flame forth
   so overpoweringly as in pardoning Grace! Is not this the Glory of God
   at its fullest, that He passes by transgression and remembers not the
   iniquity of His people?

   III. Our last word is to be upon THE MANIFESTATION OF THIS PARDON. "In
   whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins,
   according to the riches of His Grace." Here we see that forgiveness of
   sin comes to us entirely through Jesus Christ, our Savior, and if we go
   to Jesus Christ, fixing our eyes especially upon His atoning Sacrifice,
   we have pardon by virtue of His blood. I see nothing here about any
   human priest--Christ is Priest enough for us. I see nothing about
   absolution by man. No--"In Him we have redemption through His blood,
   the forgiveness of sins."

   It must be a very dangerous thing to be hoping for pardon because you
   have confessed to a man! Whatever manipulations may have been performed
   upon his shaven head, it must be a very risky thing to have your
   salvation depend upon whether or not he was properly ordained by a
   priest of higher rank! We escape all such perils by going to the
   Fountain-head, even to Christ, Himself, the one Mediator between God
   and man! According to God's command, we trust Jesus and receive
   pardon--not in word only--but in spirit and in truth. There is no
   danger in faith in Jesus, for all those who have tried it will tell you
   how blessed the result has been in their own cases! Pardon by any other
   means is impossible, but by Jesus Christ it is certain! Everything else
   fails, but faith in Christ never fails. Only trust Him! Only trust Him
   and you are pardoned, pardoned at once through His most precious blood!

   The text says, "We have" it and I want to lay stress on that for just a
   minute. "We have redemption, the forgiveness of sins." We have it! As
   many as believe in Christ are pardoned. Why, then, should we go to
   Church and say that we are "miserable sinners?" Believers are not
   miserable sinners! They are full often happy in a sense of full
   remission. If our sins are blotted out, why do we speak to God as if
   His anger still remained? Shall we lie to God? We are, indeed,
   miserable sinners if we assume a misery which we have no reason to
   feel! We are miserable sinners for not believing God and pre-

   tending that we do! Is there no difference between a Believer and an
   unbeliever, so that the same words will suit both one and the other and
   they may kneel down side by side and both call themselves, "miserable
   sinners"? Then what has the Gospel done for Believers? What is the use
   of the sprinkled blood? There is all the difference in the world
   between a Believer and an unbeliever!

   The unbeliever has the wrath of God abiding on him! But as for the
   Believer, his sins are forgiven for Christ's name's sake and let him
   know it and declare it! "Am I not, then, daily to confess sin?" Yes,
   daily as you commit it, but not under the garb of misery, as though you
   were an unpardoned criminal! Are you not a beloved child? Confess sin
   with the certainty that you are forgiven and that the sentence of
   forgiveness runs on and includes these present and future sins as well
   as all that are past. You are to humbly plead for continued mercy, but
   you are not to pray as if you were at enmity with God and miserable
   under a sense of His wrath! Far better is the spirit which sings, "O
   God, I will praise You, for though You were angry with me, Your anger
   is turned away and You comfort me."

   That is the way to talk. If you believe, you should speak in that
   fashion. No longer is the weight and burden of sin lying on your
   conscience and heart--your load is lifted--you are forgiven! If your
   child has been offending you--and you are angry with him, he feels ill
   at ease in your presence. At last you say, "My Boy, it is all gone,
   now. Do not offend again. You are quite forgiven. Come here and let me
   kiss you." Does he reply, "Father, I am afraid"? If so, it is evident
   that he does not understand that you have forgiven him--and even if he
   receives your kiss and remains unhappy in your presence, it is clear
   that he does not believe in you or in the sincerity of your
   forgiveness. As soon as the light dawns on his mind, "Father has quite
   put all my fault away," then he is merry in his play and easy in his
   conversation with you.

   Now, be with God like a child at home. Do not act towards Him as if He
   still frowned upon you. He smiles. Do not pray to Him as if you dreaded
   Him and thought He would smite you. He cannot smite you--He has smitten
   Christ instead of you. Your debt has been paid and can never be
   demanded of you. Christ nailed the receipted bill to His Cross in the
   face of Heaven and earth and Hell! Eternal Justice cannot charge you
   with sins which were, once and for all, charged on your great
   Substitute and borne by Him. God is not unrighteous to first punish
   Christ and then to punish those for whom Christ died--to take the
   payment first from Christ and afterwards from you--from the Surety and
   then from the debtor. No, no! Rest, then, in perfect peace.

   "Forgiveness according to the riches of His Grace" is yours by faith,
   yours at this moment and you may know it. You that have believed in
   Christ ought to know that you are accepted in Christ, for you are so
   accepted and it is a pity not to have the joy of it. I want you to feel
   the love which rises out of pardoned sin! You must love Him who has
   removed all your iniquities. I want you to feel the zeal which finds
   fuel in the forgiveness of sin. Bring your alabaster box and pour the
   ointment upon His head who has forgiven you so freely. There are no
   workers like pardoned men and women! There are no givers like pardoned
   men and women! There are no lovers like pardoned men and women! There
   are no singers like pardoned men and women! There are no saints before
   the Throne of God, no courtiers at the right hand of the eternal
   Sovereign like those who have washed their robes and made them white in
   the blood of the Lamb!

   Come, then, you guilty, and receive forgiveness in Christ! Come, you
   vilest of the vile, the door is set open for you and a loving heart
   invites you through these lips! I am full of hope that you will come.
   You must come. Love will constrain you to believe in my Lord. Oh, may
   the Holy Spirit compel you, now, to come to the Savior and to be
   cleansed from all sin! When you have obtained mercy hasten to tell
   others of the boundless mercy of the God of Love and of the riches of
   His Grace displayed in forgiving you all your trespasses! God bless you
   for Christ's sake. Amen.

                             The Waterpots at Cana

   A Sermon

   (No. 1556)

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled
   them up to the brim.'John 2:7.

   YOU KNOW THE NARRATIVE. Jesus was at a wedding feast, and when the wine
   ran short, he provided for it right bountifully. I do not think that I
   should do any good if I were to enter upon the discussion as to what
   sort of wine our Lord Jesus made on this occasion. It was wine, and I
   am sure it was very good wine, for he would produce nothing quite but
   the best. Was it wine such as men understand by that word now? It was
   wine; but there are very few people in this country who ever see, much
   less drink, any of that beverage. That which goes under the name of
   wine is not true wine, but a fiery, brandied concoction of which I feel
   sure that Jesus would not have tasted a drop. The fire-waters and
   blazing spirits of modern wine manufacturers are very different
   articles from the juice of the grape, mildly exhilarating, which was
   the usual wine of more sober centuries. As to the wine such as is
   commonly used in the East, a person must drink inordinately before he
   would become intoxicated with it. It would be possible, for there were
   cases in which men were intoxicated with wine; but, as a rule,
   intoxication was a rare vice in the Savior's times and in the preceding
   ages. Had our great Exemplar lived under our present circumstances,
   surrounded by a sea of deadly drink, which is ruining tens of
   thousands, I know how he would have acted. I am sure he would not have
   contributed by word or deed to the rivers of poisonous beverages in
   which bodies and souls are now being destroyed wholesale. The kind of
   wine which he made was such that, if there had been no stronger drink
   in the world, nobody might have thought it necessary to enter any
   protest against drinking it. It would have done nobody any hurt, be
   sure of that, or else Jesus our loving Savior would not have made it.

   Some have raised a question about the great quantity of wine, for I
   suppose there must have been no less than one hundred and twenty
   gallons, and probably more. They did not want all that,' says one, and
   even of the weakest kind of wine it would be a deal too much.' But you
   are thinking of an ordinary wedding here, are you not, when there are
   ten or a dozen, or a score or two, met together in a parlour? An
   oriental wedding is quite another affair. Even if it be only a village,
   like Cana of Galilee, everybody comes to eat and drink, and the feast
   lasts on for a week or a fortnight. Hundreds of people must be fed, for
   often open house is kept. Nobody is refused, and consequently a great
   quantity of provision is required. Besides, they may not have consumed
   all the wine at once. When the Lord multiplied loaves and fishes, they
   must eat the loaves and fishes directly, or else the bread would grow
   mouldy, and the fish would be putrid; but wine could be stored and used
   months afterwards. I have no doubt that such wine as Jesus Christ made
   was as good for keeping as it was for using. And why not set the family
   up with a store in hand? They were not very rich people. They might
   sell it if they liked. At any rate, that is not my subject, and I do
   not intend getting into hot water over the question of cold water. I
   abstain myself from alcoholic drink in every form, and I think others
   would be wise to do the same; but of this each one must be a guide unto
   himself.

   Jesus Christ commenced the gospel dispensation, not with a miracle of
   vengeance, like that of Moses, who turned water into blood, but with a
   miracle of liberality, turning water into wine. He does not only supply
   necessaries, but gives luxuries, and this is highly significant of the
   kingdom of his grace. Here he not only gives sinners enough to save
   them, but he gives abundantly, grace upon grace. The gifts of the
   covenant are not stinted or stunted, they are neither small in quantity
   nor in quality. He gives to men not only the water of life that they
   may drink and be refreshed, but wines on the lees well refined' that
   they may rejoice exceedingly. And he gives like a king, who gives
   lavishly, without counting the cups and bottles. As to one hundred and
   twenty gallons, how little is that in comparison with the rivers of
   love and mercy which he is pleased to bestow freely out of his
   bountiful heart upon the most needy souls. You may forget all about the
   wine question, and all about wine, bad, good, or indifferent. The less
   we have to do with it the better, I am quite sure. And now let us think
   about our Lord's mercy, and let the wine stand as a type of his grace,
   and the abundance of it as the type of the abundance of his grace which
   he doth so liberally bestow.

   Now, concerning this miracle, it may well be remarked how simple and
   unostentatious it was. One might have expected that when the great Lord
   of all came here in human form he would commence his miraculous career
   by summoning the scribes and Pharisees at least, if not the kings and
   princes of the earth, to see the marks of his calling and the
   guarantees and warrants of his commission; gathering them all together
   to work some miracle before them, as Moses and Aaron did before
   Pharaoh, that they might be convinced of his Messiahship. He does
   nothing of the kind. He goes to a simple wedding among poor people, and
   there in the simplest and most natural way he displays his glory. When
   the water is to be turned into wine, when he selects that as the first
   miracle, he does not call for the master of the feast even, or for the
   bridegroom himself or for any of the guests, and begin to say, You
   clearly perceive that your wine is all gone. Now, I am about to show
   you a great marvel, to turn water into wine.' No, he does it quietly
   with the servants: he tells them to fill the waterpots: he uses the
   baths: he does not ask for any new vessels, but uses what were there,
   making no fuss or parade. He uses water, too, of which they had
   abundance, and works the miracle, if I may so speak, in the most
   commonplace and natural style; and that is just the style of Jesus
   Christ. Now, if it had been a Romish miracle it would have been done in
   a very mysterious, theatrical, sensational way, with no end of
   paraphernalia; but, being a genuine miracle, it is done just as nearly
   after the course of nature as the supernatural can go. Jesus does not
   have the waterpots emptied and then fill them with wine, but he goes as
   far with nature as nature will go, and uses water to make the wine
   from; therein following the processes of his providence which are at
   work every day. When the water drops from heaven, and flows into the
   earth to the roots of the vine, and so swells out the clusters with
   ruddy juice, it is through water that wine is produced. There is only a
   difference as to time whether the wine is created in the cluster, or in
   the waterpots. Our Lord does not call for any strangers to do it, but
   the ordinary servants shall bring ordinary water; and while they are
   drawing out the water, or what appears to them to be water, the
   servants shall perceive that the water has been turned into wine.

   Now, whenever you try to serve Jesus Christ do not make a fuss about
   it, because he never made any fuss in what he did, even when he was
   working amazing miracles. If you want to do a good thing, go and do it
   as naturally as ever you can. Be simple hearted and simple minded. Be
   yourself. Do not be affected in your piety, as if you were going to
   walk to heaven on stilts: walk on your own feet, and bring religion to
   your own door and to your own fireside. If you have a grand work to do,
   do it with that genuine simplicity which is next. akin to sublimity;
   for affectation, and everything that is gaudy and ostentatious, is,
   after all, mean and beggarly. Nothing but simple naturalness has a bout
   it a genuine beauty; and such a beauty there is about this miracle of
   the Savior.

   Let all these remarks stand as a kind of preface; for now I want to
   draw out the principles which are hidden in my text; and then,
   secondly, when I have displayed those principles, I want to show how
   they should be carried out.

   I. Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water.' WHAT ARE THE
   PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN OUR LORD'S MODE OF PROCEDURE?

   First, that, as a rule, when Christ is about to bestow a blessing he
   gives a command. This is a fact which your memories will help you to
   establish in a moment. It is not always so; but, as a general rule, a
   word of command goes before a word of power, or else with it. He is
   about to give wine, and the process does not consist in saying, Let
   wine be,' but it begins by a command addressed to men,'Fill the
   waterpots with water.' Here is a blind man: Christ is about to give him
   sight. He puts clay on his eyes, and then says, Go to the pool of
   Siloam and wash.' There is a man with his arm swinging at his side,
   useless to him: Christ is going to restore it, and he says, Stretch
   forth thine hand.' Ay, and the principle goes so far that it holds good
   in cases where it would seem to be quite inapplicable, for if it be a
   child that is dead he says, Maid, arise;' or if it be Lazarus, who by
   this time stinks, being four days buried, yet he cries, Lazarus, come
   forth.' And thus he bestows a benefit by a command. Gospel benefits
   come with a gospel precept.

   Do you wonder that this principle which is seen in the miracles is seen
   in the wonders of his divine grace? Here is a sinner to be saved. What
   does Christ say to that sinner? Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and
   thou shalt be saved.' Can he believe of himself? Is he not dead in sin?
   Brethren, raise no such questions, but learn that Jesus Christ has
   bidden men believe, and has commissioned his disciples to cry, Repent
   ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.' The times of this ignorance
   God winked at; but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent.' And he
   bids us go and preach this word'Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and
   thou shalt be saved.' But why command them? It is his will to do so,
   and that should be enough for you who call yourself his disciple. It
   was so even in the olden times, when the Lord set forth in vision his
   way of dealing with a dead nation. There lay the dry bones of the
   valley, exceeding many, and exceeding dry, and Ezekiel was sent to
   prophesy to them. What said the prophet? O ye dry bones, hear the word
   of the Lord.' Is that his way of making them alive? Yes, by a command
   to hear; a thing which dry bones cannot do. He issues his command to
   the dead, the dry, the helpless, and by its power life comes. I pray
   you, be not disobedient to the gospel, for faith is a duty, or we
   should not read of the obedience of faith.' Jesus Christ, when he is
   about to bless, challenges men's obedience by issuing his royal orders.

   The same thing is true when we come away from the unconverted to
   believers. When God means to bless his people and make them blessings
   it is by issuing a command to them. We have been praying to the Lord
   that he would arise and make bare his arm. His answer is, Awake, awake,
   O Zion.' We ask that the world may be brought to his feet, and his
   reply is, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye
   therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them.' The command is to us
   the vehicle of the blessing. If we are to have the blessing of converts
   multiplied, and churches built up, Christ must give us the boon: it is
   altogether his gift, as much as it was his to turn the water into wine;
   yet first of all he says to us, Go ye and proclaim my salvation unto
   the ends of the earth,' for thus are we to fill the waterpots with
   water. If we be obedient to his command we shall see how he will
   work'how mightily he will be with us, and how our prayers shall be
   heard.

   That is the first principle that I see here: Christ issues commands to
   those whom he will bless.

   Secondly, Christ's commands are not to be questioned, but to be obeyed.
   The people want wine, and Christ says, Fill the waterpots with water.'
   Well, now, if these servants had, been of the mind of the captious
   critics of modern times, they would have looked at our Lord a long
   while, and objected boldly: We do not want any water; it is not the
   feast of purifications; it is a wedding feast. We do not require water
   at a wedding. We shall want water when we are going up to the
   synagogue, or to the temple, that we may purify our hands according to
   our custom: but we do not want water just now: the hour, the occasion,
   and the fitness of things, call for wine.' But Mary's advice to them
   was sound' Whatsoever he saith to you, do it.' Thus, too, let us
   neither question nor cavil, but do his bidding straight away.

   It may sometimes seem that Christ's command is not pertinent to the
   point in hand. The sinner, for instance, says, Lord, save me: conquer
   in me my sin.' Our Lord cries, Believe,' and the sinner cannot see how
   believing in Jesus will enable him to get the mastery over a besetting
   sin. There does not at first sight appear to be any connection between
   the simple trusting of the Savior and the conquest of a bad temper, or
   the getting rid of a bad habit, such as intemperance, passion,
   covetousness, or' falsehood. There is such a connection, but recollect,
   whether you can see the connection or not, it is yours not to reason
   why,' but yours to do what Jesus bids you do; for it is in the way of
   the command that the miracle of mercy will be wrought. Fill the
   waterpots with water,' though what you want is wine. Christ sees a
   connection between the water and the wine, though you do not. He has a
   reason for the pots being filled with water, which reason, as yet, you
   do not know: it is not yours to ask an explanation, but to yield
   obedience. You are, in the first instance, just to do what Jesus bids
   you, as he bids you, now that he bids you, and because he bids you, and
   you shall find that his commandments are not grievous, and in keeping
   of them there is a great reward.

   Sometimes these commands may even seem to be trivial. They may look as
   if he trifled with us. The family were in need of wine; Jesus says,
   Fill the waterpots with water.' The servants might have said, This is
   clearly a mere putting of us off and playing with us. Why, we should be
   better employed in going round to these poor people's friends, and
   asking them to contribute another skin of wine. We should be much
   better employed in finding out some shop where we could purchase more:
   but to send us to the well to fill those great waterpots that hold so
   much water does seem altogether a piece of child's play.' I know,
   brethren, that sometimes the path of duty seems as if it could not lead
   to the desired result. We want to be doing something more; that
   something more might be wrong, but it looks as if we could thereby
   compass our design more easily and directly, and so we hanker after
   this uncommanded and perhaps forbidden course. And I know that many a
   troubled conscience thinks that simply to believe in Jesus is too
   little a thing. The deceitful heart suggests a course which looks to be
   more effectual. Do some penance: feel some bitterness; weep a certain
   amount of tears. Goad your mind, or break your heart': so cries carnal
   self. Jesus simply commands, Believe.' It does appear to be too little
   a thing to be done, as if it could not be that eternal life should be
   given upon putting your trust in Jesus Christ: but this is the
   principle we want to teach you'that when Jesus Christ is about to give
   a blessing he issues a command which is not to be questioned, but to be
   at once obeyed. If ye will not believe, neither shall ye be
   established; but if ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good
   of the land. Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.'

   The third principle is this'that whenever we get a command from Christ
   it is always wisdom to carry it out zealously. He said, Fill the
   waterpots with water,' and they filled them up to the brim. You know
   there is a way of filling a waterpot, and there is another way of
   filling it. It is full, and you cannot heap it up; but still you can
   fill it up till it begins almost to run over: the liquid trembles as if
   it must surely fall in a crystal cascade. It is a filling fullness. In
   fulfilling Christ's commands, my dear brethren and sisters, let us go
   to their widest extent: let us fill them up to the brim. If it is
   Believe,' oh, believe him with all your might; trust him with your
   whole heart. If it is Preach the gospel,' preach it in season and out
   of season; and preach the gospel'the whole of it. Fill it up to the
   brim. Do not give the people a half gospel. Give them a brimming-over
   gospel. Fill the vessels up to the very brim. If you are to repent, ask
   to have a hearty and a deep repentance'full to the brim. If you are to
   believe, ask to have an intense, absolute, childlike dependence, that
   your faith may be full to the brim. If you are bidden pray, pray
   mightily: fill the vessel of prayer up to the brim. If you are to
   search the Scriptures for blessing, search them from end to end: fill
   the Bible-reading vessel up to the brim. Christ's commands are never
   meant to be done in a half-hearted manner. Let us throw our whole soul
   into whatever he commands us, even though, as yet, we cannot see the
   reason why he has set us the task. Christ's commands should be
   fulfilled with enthusiasm, and carried out to the extreme, if extreme
   be possible.

   The fourth principle is that our earnest action in obedience to Christ
   is not contrary to our dependence upon him, but it is necessary to our
   dependence upon him. I will show you that in a moment. There are some
   brethren I know who say, Hem! you hold what you call revival services,
   and you try to arouse men by earnest appeals and exciting addresses. Do
   you not see that God will do his own work? These efforts are just your
   trying to take the work out of God's hands. The proper way is to trust
   in him, and do nothing.' All right, brother. We have your word for
   it'that you trust in him and do nothing. I take the liberty not to be
   so very certain that you do trust him, for if I remember who you are,
   and I think I have been to your house, you are about the most
   miserable, desponding, unbelieving person that I know. You do not even
   know whether you are saved yourself nine times out of ten. Well now, I
   think you should hardly come and cry yourself up for your faith. If you
   had such a wonderfully great faith, there is no doubt whatever that
   according to your faith it would be unto you. How many have been added
   to your church through your doing nothing this year'that blessed church
   of yours, where you exercise this, blessed faith without works? How
   many have been brought in? Well, we do not have very many additions.'
   No, and I think you are not likely to have. If you go about the
   extension of the Redeemer's kingdom by inaction, I do not think that
   you go the way to work which Jesus Christ approves of. But we venture
   to say to you that we who go in for working for Christ with all our
   heart and soul, using any means within our reach to bring men in to
   hear the gospel, feel as much as ever you do that we cannot do anything
   at all in the matter apart from the Holy Spirit, and we trust in God, I
   think, almost as much as you do, because our faith has produced rather
   more results than yours has done. I should not wonder if it turns out
   that your faith without works is dead, being alone, and that our faith
   having works with it has been living faith after all. I will put the
   case thus: Jesus Christ says, Fill the waterpots with water.' The
   orthodox servant says, My Lord, I fully believe that thou canst make
   wine for these people without any water, and by thy leave I will bring
   no water. I am not going to interfere with the work of God. I am quite
   certain that thou dost not want our help, gracious Lord. Thou canst
   make these waterpots to be full of wine without our bringing a single
   bucket of water, and so we will not rob thee of the glory of it. We
   will just stand back, and wait for thee. When the wine is made we will
   drink some of it and bless thy name; but meanwhile we pray thee have us
   excused, for pails are heavy carrying, and a good many must needs be
   brought to fill all those waterpots. It would be interfering with the
   divine work, and so we would rather take our ease.' Do you not think
   that servants who talked so would prove that they had no faith in Jesus
   at all? We will not say that it would prove their unbelief, but we will
   say that it looks very like it. But look at the servant there who, as
   soon as ever Jesus commands' Fill the waterpots with water,' says, I do
   not know what he is at. I do not see the connection between fetching
   this water and providing the feast with wine, but I am off to the well:
   here, hand me a couple of pails. Come along, brother; come along and
   help fill the baths.' There they go, and soon come joyfully back with
   the water, pouring it into the troughs till they are full up to the
   brim. Those seem to me to be the believing servants who obey the
   command, not understanding it, but expecting that, somehow or other,
   Jesus Christ knows the way to work his own miracle. By our earnest
   exertions we are not interfering with him, dear friends; far from it.
   We are proving our faith in him if we work for him as he bids us work,
   and trust in him alone with undivided faith.

   The next principle I must lay equal stress upon is this,'our action
   alone is not sufficient. That we know, but let me remind you of it yet
   again. There are these waterpots, these troughs, these baths: they are
   full, and could not be fuller. What a spilling of water there is! You
   see that in their trying to fill them the water runs over here and
   there. Well, all these six great baths are full of water. Is there any
   more wine for all that? Not a drop. It is water that they brought,
   nothing but water, and it remains water still. Suppose that they should
   take that water into the feast; I am half afraid that the guests would
   not have thought cold water quite the proper liquid to drink at a
   wedding. They ought to have done so; but I am afraid they were not
   educated in the school of total abstinence. They would have said to the
   master of the feast, Thou hast given us good wine, and water is a poor
   finish for the feast.' I am sure it would not have done. And yet water
   it was, depend upon it, and nothing else but water, when the servants
   poured it into the pots. Even so, after all that sinners can. do, and
   all that saints can do, there is nothing in any human effort which can
   avail for the saving of a soul till Christ speaks the word of power.
   When Paul has planted and Apollos watered, there is no increase till
   God gives it. Preach the gospel, labor with souls, persuade, entreat,
   exhort; but there is no power in anything that you do until Jesus
   Christ displays his divine might. His presence is our power. Blessed be
   his name, he will come; and if we fill the waterpots with water, he
   will turn it into wine. He alone can do it, and those servants who show
   the most alacrity in filling up the waterpots are among the first to
   confess that it is he alone who can perform the deed.

   And now the last principle here is that although human action in itself
   falls short of the desired end, yet it has its place, and God has made
   it necessary by his appointment. Why did our Lord have these waterpots
   filled with water? I do not say that it was necessary that it should
   have been done. It was not absolutely necessary in itself; but in order
   that the miracle might be all open and above board, it was necessary;
   for suppose he had said, Go to those waterpots and draw out wine,'
   those who watched him might have said that there was wine there before,
   and that no miracle was wrought. When our Lord had them filled up with
   water, there remained no room for any wine to be hidden away. It was
   just the same as with Elijah, when, in order to prove that there was no
   concealed fire upon the altar at Carmel, he bade them go down to the
   sea, and bring water, and pour it upon the altar, and upon the victim,
   till the trenches were filled. He said, Do it a second time,' and they
   did it a second time; and he said. Do it a third time,' and they did it
   a third time, and no possibility of imposture remained. And so, when
   the Lord Jesus bade the servants fill the waterpots with water, he put
   it beyond all possibility that he should be charged with imposture; and
   thus we see why it was necessary that they should be filled with water.

   Moreover, it was necessary, because it was so instructive to the
   servants. Did you notice when I was reading it that the master of the
   feast, when he tasted the good wine, did not know where it came from.
   He could not make it out, and he uttered an expression which showed his
   surprise, mingled with his ignorance. But it is written, The servants
   which drew the water knew.' Now, when souls are converted in a church,
   it happens much in the same way with certain of the members, who are
   good people, but they do not know much about the conversion of sinners.
   They do not feel much joy in revivals; in fact, like the elder brother,
   they are rather suspicious of these wild characters being brought in:
   they consider themselves to be very respectable, and. they would rather
   not have the lowest of people sitting in the pew with them: they feel
   awkward in coming so near them. They know little about what is going
   on. But the servants which drew the water knew': that is to say, the
   earnest believers who do the work, and try to fill the waterpots, know
   all about it. Jesus bade them fill the vessels with water on purpose
   that the men who drew the water might know that it was a miracle. I
   warrant you, if you bring souls. to Christ you will know his power. It
   will make you leap for joy to hear the cry of the penitent, and mark
   the bright flash of delight that passes over the new-born believer's
   face when his sins are washed away, and he feels himself renewed. If
   you want to know Jesus. Christ's miraculous power you must go and'not
   work miracles, but just draw the water and fill the waterpots. Do the
   ordinary duties. of Christian men and women'things in which there is no
   power of themselves, but which Jesus Christ makes to be connected with
   his divine working, and it shall be for your instruction, and your
   comfort, that you had such work to do. The servants which drew the
   water knew.'

   I think that I have said enough upon the principles which lie concealed
   within my text.

   II. You must have patience with me while I try to apply these
   principles to practical purposes. LET US SEE HOW TO CARRY OUT THIS
   DIVINE COMMAND, Fill the waterpots with water.'

   First, use in the service of Christ such abilities as you have. There
   stood the waterpots, six of them, and Jesus used what he found ready to
   his hand. There was water in the well; our Lord used that also. Our
   Lord is accustomed to employ his own people, and such abilities as they
   have, rather than angels or a novel class of beings created fresh for
   the purpose. Now, dear brothers and sisters, if you have no golden
   chalices, fill your earthen vessels. If you cannot consider yourselves
   to be goblets of rarest workmanship in silver, or if you could not
   liken yourselves to the best Sevres ware, it does not matter; fill the
   vessels which you have. If you cannot, with Elias, bring fire from.
   heaven, and if you cannot work miracles with the apostles, do what you
   can. If silver and gold you have none, yet such as you have dedicate to
   Christ. Bring water at his bidding, and it will be better than wine.
   The commonest gifts can be made to serve Christ's purpose. Just as he
   took a few loaves and fishes, and fed the crowd with them, so will he
   take your six waterpots and the water, and do his wine-making
   therewith.

   Thus, you see, they improved what they had; for the waterpots were
   empty, but they filled them. There are a good many brethren here from
   the College to-night, and they are trying to improve their gifts and
   their abilities. I think you do right, my brethren. But I have heard
   some people say, The Lord Jesus does not want your learning.' No, it is
   very likely that he does not, any more than he needed the water: but
   then he certainly does not want your stupidity and your ignorance, and
   he does not want your rough, uncultivated ways of speaking. He did not
   seek for empty pitchers on this occasion; he would have them full, and
   the servants did well to fill them. Our Lord to-day does not want empty
   heads in his ministers, nor empty hearts; so, my brethren, fill your
   waterpots with water. Work away, and study away, and learn all you can,
   and fill the waterpots with water. Oh,' somebody will say, but how are
   such studies to lead to the conversion of men? Conversion is like wine,
   and all that these young fellows will learn will be like water.' You
   are right; but still I bid these students fill the waterpots with
   water, and expect the Lord Jesus to turn the water into wine. He can
   sanctify human knowledge so that it shall be useful to the setting
   forth of the knowledge of Jesus Christ. I hope that the day has gone by
   when it is so much as dreamed that ignorance and coarseness are helpful
   to the kingdom of Christ. The great Teacher would have his people know
   all that they can know, and especially know himself and the Scriptures,
   that they may set him forth, and proclaim his gospel. Fill the
   waterpots with water.'

   Next, to apply this principle, let us all use such means of blessing as
   God appoints. What are they? First, there is the reading of the
   Scriptures. Search the Scriptures.' Search them all you can. Try to
   understand them. But if I know the Bible, shall I be therefore saved.'
   No, you must know Christ himself by the Spirit. Still, fill the
   waterpots with water.' While you are studying the Scriptures you may
   expect the Savior will bless his own word, and turn the water into
   wine.

   Then there is attendance upon the means of grace, and hearing a gospel
   ministry. Mind you fill that waterpot with water. But I may hear
   thousands of sermons and not be saved.' I know it is so, but your
   business is to fill this waterpot with water, and while you are
   listening to the gospel God will bless it, for faith cometh by hearing,
   and hearing by the word of God.' Take care to use the means which God
   appoints. Since our Lord has appointed to save men by the preaching of
   the word, I pray that he will raise up those who will preach without
   ceasing, in season and out of season, indoors and in the streets. But
   they won't be saved by our preaching.' I know that. Preaching is the
   water: and while we are preaching, God will bless it, and turn the
   water into wine. Let us distribute religious books and tracts. Oh, but
   people won't be saved by reading them.' Very likely not, but while they
   are reading them God may bring his truth to remembrance and impress
   their hearts. Fill the waterpots with water.' Give away abundance of
   tracts. Scatter religious literature everywhere. Fill the waterpots
   with water,' and the Lord will turn the water into wine.

   Remember the prayer-meeting. What a blessed means of grace it for it
   brings down power for all the works of the church: fill that waterpot
   with water. I have not to complain of your attendance at
   prayer-meetings; but oh, keep it up, dear brethren! You can pray.
   Blessed be his name, you have the spirit of prayer. Pray on! Fill the
   waterpots with water,' and in answer to prayer Jesus will turn it into
   wine. Sunday-school teachers, do not neglect your blessed means of
   usefulness. Fill the waterpots with water.' Work the Sunday-school
   system with all your might. But it will not save the children merely to
   get them together, and teach them of Jesus. We cannot give them new
   hearts.' Who said that you could? Fill the waterpots with water.' Jesus
   Christ knows how to turn it into wine, and he does not fail to do it
   when we are obedient to his commands.

   Use all the means, but take care that you use those means right
   heartily. I come back to that part of the text'And they filled them up
   to the brim.' When you teach the young ones in the Sunday-school, teach
   them well. Fill them to the brim. When you preach, dear sir, do not
   preach as if you were only half awake; stir yourself up; fill your
   ministry to the brim. When you are trying to evangelize the community,
   do not attempt it in a half-hearted way, as if you did not care whether
   their souls were saved or not; fill them to the brim; preach the gospel
   with all your might, and beg for power from on high. Fill every vessel
   to the brim. Whatever is worth doing is worth doing well. Nobody ever
   yet served Christ too well. I have heard that in some services there
   may be too much zeal, but in the service of Christ you may have as much
   zeal as ever you will and yet not exceed, if prudence be joined
   therewith. Fill the waterpots with water,' and fill them to the brim.
   Go in for doing good with all your heart and soul and strength.

   Further, in order to apply this principle, be sure to remember when you
   have done all that you can do, that there is a great deficiency in all
   that you have done. It is well to come away from tract-distributing and
   Sunday-school teaching and preaching, and go home and get to your
   knees, and cry, Lord, I have done all that thou hast commanded me, and
   yet there is nothing done unless thou givest the finishing touch. Lord,
   I have filled the waterpots, and though I could only fill them with
   water, yet I have filled them to the brim. Lord, to the best of my
   ability, I have sought to win men for thyself. There cannot be a soul
   saved, a child converted, or any glory brought to thy name by what I
   have done, in and of itself; but, my Master, speak the miracle-working
   word, and let the water which fills the vessels blush into wine. Thou
   canst do it, though I cannot. I cast the burden upon thee.'

   And this leads me to the last application of the principle, which
   is'trust in your Lord to do the work. You see, there are two ways of
   filling waterpots. Suppose these people had never been commanded to
   fill the waterpots, and their doing it had had no reference to Christ
   whatever; suppose that it had been a freak of their own imagination,
   and they had said, These people have no wine, but they shall have a
   bath if they like, and so we will fill the six waterpots with water.'
   Nothing would have come of such a proceeding. There would have stood
   the water. The Eton school-boy said, The conscious water saw its God
   and blushed,' a truly poetic expression; but the conscious water would
   have seen the servants, and would not have blushed. It would have
   reflected their faces upon its shining surface, but nothing more would
   have happened. Jesus Christ himself must come, and in present power
   must work the miracle. It was because he had commanded the servants to
   fill the waterpots with water that therefore he was bound, if I may use
   such an expression of our free King, bound to turn it into wine, for
   otherwise he would have been making fools of them, and they also might
   have turned round and said, Why didst thou give us such a command as
   this?' If, after we have filled the waterpots with water, Jesus does
   not work by us, we shall have done what he bade us; but if we believe
   in him, I make bold to say that he is bound to come; for though we
   should be losers, and dreadful losers too, if he did not display his
   power, for we should have to lament, I have labored in vain, and spent
   my strength for nought,' yet we should not be such losers as he would
   be, for straightway the world would affirm that Christ's commands are
   empty, fruitless, idle. It would be declared that obedience to his word
   brings no result. The world would say, You have filled the waterpots
   with water because he told you to do it. You expected him to turn the
   water into wine, but he did not do it. Your faith is vain; your whole
   obedience is vain; and he is not a fit Master to be served.' We should
   be losers, but he would be a greater loser still, for he would lose his
   glory. For my part, I do not believe that a good word for Christ is
   ever spoken in vain. I am sure that no sermon with Christ in it is ever
   preached without result. Something will come of it, if not to-night,
   nor to-morrow; something will come of it. When I have printed a sermon,
   and seen it fairly in the volume, I have before long been delighted to
   hear of souls saved by its means. And when I have not printed, but only
   preached, a discourse, I have still thought, something will come of it.
   I preached Christ. I put his saving truth into that sermon, and that
   seed cannot die. If it shall lie in the volume for years, like the
   grains of wheat in the mummy's hand, it will live, and grow, and bear
   fruit. Consequently, I have heard but lately of a soul brought to
   Christ by a sermon that I preached twenty-five years ago. I hear almost
   every week of souls having been brought to Christ by sermons preached
   at Park Street, and Exeter Hall, and the Surrey Gardens, and therefore
   I feel that God will not let a single faithful testimony fall to the
   ground. Go on, brethren. Go on filling the waterpots with water. Do not
   believe that you are doing much when you have done your utmost. Do not
   begin to congratulate yourselves on your past success. All must come
   from Christ; and it will come from Christ. Do not go to the
   prayer-meeting and say, Paul may plant and Apollos may water, but 'and
   so on. That is not how the passage runs. It says just the contrary, and
   runs thus,'Paul planteth, Apollos watereth, but God giveth the
   increase.' The increase is surely given by God where the planting and
   sowing are rightly done. The servants fill the waterpots: the Master
   turns the water into wine.

   The Lord grant us grace to be obedient to his command, especially to
   that command, Believe and live!' and may we meet him in the
   marriage-feast above to drink of the new wine with him for ever and
   ever. Amen and amen.

Walking Humbly With God

   (No. 1557)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 12, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He has shown you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require
   of you, but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your
   God?" Micah 6:8.

   WE shall chiefly dwell upon the last line--"To walk humbly with your
   God." Man asks, "Why should I come before the Lord and bow myself
   before the high God?" and, as if he must set himself to answer his own
   question, he farther enquires, "Shall I come before Him with burnt
   offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with
   thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil?" Sacrifice
   of some sort is his idea--he supposes that he must supply the sacrifice
   himself and would gladly know what it should be. The answer which is
   given him chides him for the supposition that he is to answer his own
   question, for it begins thus--"He has shown you, O man, what is good;
   and what does the Lord require of you."

   If we had been attentive to God's voice we should not now be asking,
   "why should I come?" for He has already shown us the way. The worship
   of God is the subject of Revelation, not of invention. True religion is
   not a new design displaying each man's taste, but a copy from a plan,
   framed and fixed by the Lord Himself. We are to follow a path well
   defined and not map out a course for ourselves. We are not like
   children crying in the dark after an unknown Father whom we seek by
   ways of our own, but we are as babes who follow where the warm hand of
   Love gently draws them. To us it is not night, for the true light has
   risen and is shining round about us--the Father has revealed Himself
   and we have an unction from the Holy One so that all things necessary
   for this life and godliness are lifted out of the region of the unknown
   and placed among the matters concerning which the Prophet says, "He has
   shown you, O man."

   The true worship of God is not left to be a matter of conjecture, to be
   worked out by a man's thoughts from within, but it is a matter of
   distinct Revelation to be received by faith from above. Do we all know
   this? Are there not some among us, or at least around us, who desire a
   religion of their own? Is not this one of the special follies of the
   period? Let us escape from this snare! "He has shown you, O man, what
   is good." Abstain, therefore, from further invention. When once we know
   from God, Himself, what His requirements are, it becomes treason to
   debate the question any further! The statement inspired by Infinite
   Wisdom satisfies every loyal heart. What God says is to be accepted as
   final fact--to raise further question is a shuffling method of calling
   God a liar.

   He who still asks the road, virtually denies that God has shown it to
   Him. It is not altogether their humility which keeps certain minds in
   what they call a receptive condition, never dogmatic, never
   confident--or, as Paul more plainly puts it--"ever learning and never
   able to come to the knowledge of the truth." To me it would be high
   presumption not to be sure and confident when God is the Teacher. To
   push further enquiries where Revelation speaks is either to deny the
   Revelation or to question its sufficiency. It cannot be that the
   declarations of God need to be supplemented by opinions and views of
   our own. "He has shown you, O man, what is good"--let this suffice us
   and, ceasing to theorize, let us practically obey!

   Let us become disciples and in this frame of mind we shall gain one of
   the first essentials of true worship. True worship cannot, therefore,
   be will-worship and will-worship cannot be true worship. We are to
   bring to God that which God requires of us. We are to act towards God
   as He commands us and to accept from God that which He presents to us.
   Our approaches to the Most High are no longer to be a matter of our own
   taste and cleverness, but to be obedient movements of reverent faith,
   bowing before the solemn Word of the great King. "He has shown you, O
   man, what is good." It is clear from the text before us that God has
   once and forever settled the way by which He is to be honored among
   men--

   and He has declared that it is not by outward rites and ceremonies. He
   pours contempt upon these in many Scriptures when He regards them by
   themselves.

   In our text He says not a single word as to burnt offerings and calves
   of a year old. The question has been asked, but in His answer He makes
   no allusion to the rams and to the rivers of oil of which the
   questioner thought so much. No, but He says "What does the Lord require
   of you, but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your
   God?" It seems, then, that it is far more important to do right than to
   perform the most imposing religious rites--better to act mercifully
   than to offer the most costly sacrifices. Much more value is attached
   to a man's moral character than to all his outward religiousness,
   however far he may carry it. The upright and generous actions of daily
   life are better signs of a gracious heart than lavish gifts to the
   temple and its priests. God judges a man rather by what he does
   ordinarily among his fellows than by what he does sumptuously when he
   is gorgeously arrayed in his profession and stands in a chief place of
   the synagogue and is admired as a chief speaker, or a generous giver to
   the holy cause.

   "To obey is better than sacrifice and to listen than the fat of rams."
   Those who are acceptable with God are those who do justly, love mercy
   and walk humbly with Him. Every man who is a true Christian does
   justly. If faith does not make a man honest, it is not an honest faith!
   If our conversion has not made us upright, may the Lord convert us
   again! When a man's heart is right with God, he longs to deal rightly
   with his fellow men and shrinks from the idea of taking undue
   advantage. He who has been washed in the blood of Jesus Christ will not
   knowingly and willfully defile himself with unjust gain. To his
   employees, his customers, his employer, he aims to do justly. Nor is
   this all, for he loves mercy. He tries to love his neighbor as himself.
   If there is an act of kindness to be done, he delights to do it--if
   there is misery to be helped, needs to be relieved, good to be
   bestowed, he says, "Let me have a hand in it, for it is good for me to
   do good." The man who is loved by the All-Merciful is one who loves
   mercy. The God of Mercy cannot take pleasure in the churlish and
   brutal. The hard, the cruel, the grasping, the oppressing, the sternly
   unforgiving are not such as the Lord delights in.

   Another point remains. It is the third thing and it is put third
   because it is of the highest importance--"to walk humbly with your
   God." This is an inward thing, but little observed. It is observable
   enough in its consequences, but not in itself and, therefore, very apt
   to be overlooked. "To walk humbly with your God" is as necessary as to
   do justly and to love mercy, but few there are that do it and,
   therefore, at this time I would earnestly insist upon this vital, this
   essential point. I pray God the Holy Spirit to make humble walking with
   God to seem as important to you as it does to me and to me as important
   as it does to Him--for He puts it here in the very forefront of
   spiritual necessities.

   I. First, Brothers and Sisters, we may say of the humble walk which God
   demands and accepts that IT IS EXCELLENT IN ITSELF. This is one of the
   things which is good, good morally, good in present effect, good in
   eternal results. Nothing is better for you, O man, than to walk humbly
   with your God. Notice every single word of our text, for under this
   head I will explain humble walking, that you may see its excellence.
   Humble walking with God signifies, first, a perception of God's Being
   and Presence. In order to our acceptance with God, we must know that He
   is and that He is the Rewarder of them that diligently seek Him. We
   must distinctly recognize that there is a God and that He is near us--
   that He is real and true and that we are living in actual nearness to
   Him.

   We are to walk with Him and this cannot be done unless we know that He
   is near--men do not walk with myths, or ideas, or remote existences. To
   have a real God is the backbone of character and to keep company with
   Him day by day is the right arm of godliness. How many live as if God
   were a nonentity, a dream, a theological fable, a respectable fancy and
   no more? But the acceptable character is made and formed mainly by the
   fact that God is and that God surrounds us. It is only in the sunlight
   of God's own Countenance, consciously experienced, that true holiness
   can be produced and ripened. The godly man is moved to action, helped
   in endurance, nerved with courage, fired with zeal, elevated with
   devotion and purified in life by the Presence of God. "You, God, see
   me," is a great sanctifier!

   The Lord said to Abraham, "Walk before Me and be you
   perfect"--otherwise there is no perfection. David said, "I will walk
   before the Lord in the land of the living"--there is no other safe
   walking. We are never right unless God is the Friend of our pilgrimage,
   the Companion of our thoughts, the Rest of our weariness, the Home of
   our delight, the very Element of our life! Such nearness to God is
   good--do we know what it means? In addition, there must be an
   appropriating and accepting of this ever-present God as our God. The
   text says," Walk humbly with your God." Observe that. He

   must be our God. We must feel that if no other beings will worship
   Jehovah, we will do so with our whole hearts. "This God is our God
   forever and ever." "O God, You are my God; early will I seek You."

   We believe that Jehovah is our Creator, Preserver and Redeemer and if
   no other creature through whose veins life is throbbing will
   acknowledge Him as its God, we will, alone, adore and worship Him. We
   take Him to be our Ruler, Leader, Law-Giver, Helper and Confidence--and
   if all the world shall set up other gods, we, alone, will serve
   Jehovah. "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." This firm
   allegiance is good and works towards all that is good. When a man feels
   that he can call God, his God and that he can take hold upon His
   Covenant, then is he strong for honor and virtue and all things that
   are pleasing unto God. Because God has entered into covenant with us in
   Christ Jesus and we have given ourselves over unto Him by a Covenant of
   Salt, therefore we stand firm against temptation and endure as seeing
   Him who is invisible.

   Come, Brothers and Sisters, are your hearts thus fixed on God at this
   moment? Do your spirits walk with your God? Or are you at a distance
   from God, wandering away from Him? Have you forgotten that God is
   yours? Are you looking upon Him as another man's God? Oh, you cannot be
   strong, clear and joyous in spirit till God is yours and all your life
   is spent with Him--till whether you roam, or rest, or sleep, or
   wake--you still abide with your own God and find your happiness in Him.
   As the fish abides in the ocean and the bird in the air and each calls
   the sea and the sky its own, so do we dwell in God and He is ours
   forever and ever! This is not all, the text sets forth the accepted man
   as always active in the Presence of His God.

   "To walk" with God denotes an active habit, a communion in the common
   movements of the day. Some bow humbly before God in the hour of prayer.
   Others sit humbly in His Presence at the time of meditation and others
   string themselves up to draw near to God in seasons of religious
   excitement. But all this falls short of walking with God. Walking is a
   very common pace, an ordinary rate of progress and it does not seem to
   require great effort--but then it is a practical working pace, a rate
   at which a man can continue on and on and make a day's journey by the
   time the sun is down. So walking with God means being with God always,
   being with God in common things, being with Him on Monday, Tuesday,
   Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday--as well as on the Sabbath!

   It means being with Him in the shop, with Him in the kitchen, with Him
   in the field, feeling His Presence in buying and selling, in weighing
   and measuring, in plowing and reaping--doing as unto the Lord the most
   common acts of life. This it is which is acceptable with the Most High
   and this is the man who has gotten into a right condition before His
   Maker--the man who "walks" with His God! Then comes in the qualifying
   word of, "humbly," about which we have to speak most at this time. It
   was necessary to remind you of the other matters first. God must be
   recognized as always present, appropriated as our God and felt to be a
   power in all our life or else there can be no humble walking with Him.
   You must have the verb or there is no sense in the adverb--you must
   walk before there is any sense in the exhortation to walk humbly.

   But now comes the humbling--we are to live towards God in all that we
   do in a lowly, reverent spirit. We are not bid slavishly to crouch, but
   humbly to walk. How lowly and penitently we are to walk, let gracious
   men remind us. If we are favored to walk with God as Abraham did, in
   all the sweet familiarity of friend with Friend, yet must we remember,
   as he did, that we are but dust and ashes. Our closest communion must
   take the form of worship. When we see our Lord, best, we must fall at
   His feet with awe. When our walk with God is closest and clearest, we
   must be overwhelmed with adoring wonder at the condescension which
   permits us to think of speaking with the Eternal One. To this reverence
   must be added a constant sense of dependence--walking humbly with God
   in the sense of daily drawing all supplies from Him and gratefully
   admitting that it is so. We are never to indulge a thought of
   independence from God, as if we were anything, or could do anything
   apart from Him.

   Walking humbly with God involves a profound deference to His will and a
   glad submission to it--yielding both active obedience and passive
   acquiescence. Humble walking with God cries under cutting afflictions,
   "It is the Lord! Let Him do what seems good to Him." When the Lord bids
   me serve Him, I must cry for Grace to run in the ways of His
   commandments! And when the Lord chastens me, I must beg for patience to
   endure His appointments. Walking humbly with God implies all this and
   much more than just now we could particularly state. May the Holy
   Spirit teach us all what a broken and contrite spirit means and keep us
   always low before the Lord. The practical result of all this inward
   humbling will be an acting towards others and a moving in all matters
   as under the influence of a humble spirit.

   If a man once really comes to live and act as in the sight of God, his
   life must be one of eminent holiness and, if under a sense of God's
   Glory, he abides in deep humility of spirit, we may expect to see about
   him all that is tender and quiet. Like his Lord, he will be meek and
   lowly in heart. He will not domineer over his fellow men. He will not
   be hard, cruel, unkind. He cannot be! He who feels that he must walk
   with great softness and tenderness before his God cannot trample on
   others as if they were only fit to be the dust of his feet. You will
   not see him supremely disdainful, carrying his head among the stars as
   though he were some great one. No, he has learned to walk humbly with
   God and he thinks of himself soberly, as he ought to think. For a man
   to put on humility before God and throw it off before men would be
   hypocrisy of the vilest kind. Alas, it is too often seen, but it is
   base to the utmost--flee from it as you would from forgery and
   counterfeit and, in very truth, "walk humbly with God."

   I cannot tell you all that my text means, nor if you know it, yourself,
   can you make others understand it. Still, they will know that it is
   something very admirable which makes you to be a good neighbor and a
   considerate friend, the comfort of the sorrowful, the helper of all.
   They may not understand from where the quiet spirit derives its gentle
   dew, but they will perceive its freshness, its sparkling purity and its
   goodness and wonder at its cause. True humility begets a gentleness, a
   tenderness, a Christ-likeness which men may mock for a while, but
   which, for the most part, wins their hearts. The more instructed, the
   sooner they take knowledge of a meek-spirited man that he must have
   been with Jesus and have learned of Him. "Blessed are the meek, for
   they shall inherit the earth."

   I do not prescribe to any man that he should try to walk humbly with
   his fellow man, for without great watchfulness his spirit may glide
   into meanness and he may lose conscientiousness in a desire to please.
   But if he will aim at walking humbly with God, he will get into such a
   proper spirit that he will be in his right position towards all his
   surroundings below and above--and his life will be such as will commend
   itself both to God and men. Thus I have tried to show, while explaining
   what was meant by walking humbly with our God, that it is a thing most
   excellent in itself. O Holy Spirit, work it in us for the lowly
   Savior's sake!

   II. Secondly, this walking humbly with God is very important, for IT IS
   A TEST OF SALVATION. The man that walks humbly with God is a saved
   man--the man who does not walk humbly with God should question his
   condition before God, for in proportion as he fails here--he fails
   altogether. We will ask a few questions concerning this matter. Friend,
   if you are walking humbly with God you have taken your right place as a
   sinner condemned by the Law, for certainly you have broken the Law and
   that Law requires absolutely perfect obedience which you have not
   rendered and never will render! God's Law, then, has condemned
   you--have you condemned yourself? Have you taken your place as a
   condemned one and pleaded guilty before God?

   If you have not done so, your view of yourself differs from God's view
   of you. Your view of yourself is a proud one You are not walking humbly
   with God and you are not saved. He that never felt himself lost never
   felt himself saved--he who never confessed himself guilty has never
   been forgiven. He who has never accepted the sentence which dooms him
   has never received the pardon which absolves him. Mark this. Again, if
   you are walking humbly with God you have given Jesus Christ His right
   place. What is that? He came into the world to be the Savior of sinners
   and the only place He will deign to occupy towards you is that He shall
   save you and save you completely. Some say, "Yes, oh yes. Jesus shall
   be my Savior and do something toward my salvation."

   But He replies, "I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End."
   Christ will save us from the beginning to the end or He will have
   nothing to do with our salvation! He will have all the Glory of the
   work and the work itself must be all His own--from the foundation to
   the top stone--or else He will leave the ruin upon its own heap. Jesus
   will never consent to be a make-weight for our deficiencies. He will
   not come at our beck and call to be our lackey, to patch up our old
   rags and mend our clouted shoes. No! The Lord Jesus Christ must be
   everything and we must be nothing, or we shall never agree. Have you
   given Christ His due place, dear Friend? If you have not done so, your
   view of Christ and God's view of Christ are very different and yours is
   a proud view, for you are putting yourself into the Savior's place in
   some degree and you are not walking humbly with God.

   It is dangerous to the last degree to be pushing the Lord of Glory into
   a corner so that we may occupy His Throne. The Lord our God is a
   jealous God and He is specially jealous of the prerogatives of His Son!
   If we are so vain as to rob Christ of His Glory and deck ourselves out
   in stolen honors, we shall quickly incur His hot displeasure. When our
   heart feels that the blood and righteousness of Jesus constitute her
   only plea, then is she walking rightly and humbly with God

   and all is well. One other question is a very important one--is
   salvation seen by you to be wholly of Grace? Do you, my Friend, judge
   salvation to be partly by your own works and merits? Do you think that
   you must at least contribute an ounce weight in the scale so that you
   must add at least a fraction to the Savior's lump sum? Yes? Then it is
   a question whether you know anything about salvation.

   I do not want to make doctrinal opinions a test, but it does seem to me
   that there is something wrong in the heart which looks for salvation
   anywhere but to the free favor of God. To walk humbly with God is to
   feel, "If ever such a poor, condemned soul as I am shall be saved, it
   must be by an act of free and Sovereign mercy, for if Justice has its
   way apart from mercy I am driven forever into the darkness of despair."
   I am come to this pass, myself--that if salvation is at all of
   myself--if any merit is required of me, though it is as little as the
   small dust of the balance, or the drop that trembles in the bucket
   after it is turned upside down, I cannot find it. Grace must save me or
   I am lost! When the soul has come to that pass, it is walking humbly
   with God. But those who are, even in the smallest degree, out of the
   circle of Grace, are not walking humbly with God and they have grave
   cause to question their spiritual state.

   This suggests to me another thought. I know several persons who seem to
   be seeking peace with God and mercy in Christ, but never get it
   because, as it seems to me, they are not walking humbly with God as to
   their intellect. The last thing that some men will do is to bow their
   understanding to the teaching of God. They are always carping and
   raising quibbles with God instead of believing Him. They need to be
   silenced as Job was before the manifested Glory of God, or they will
   die asking questions. Those mysterious Truths of God which relate to
   the Most High--such creatures as we are can never expect to understand!
   In the region of the Infinite there is ample space for faith, but
   reason loses her track. Faith is our privilege--let us exercise it
   freely towards the Lord.

   In God's great family is the comprehension of the Father's mind to be a
   sine qua non of our affection for Him? Am I never to believe what my
   Father tells me till I understand it? Must all Your gold, great God, be
   tried in my crucible before I will accept it at Your hand? Are You a
   liar unless my brain prove You true? Am I, after all, to be lord over
   my own thoughts and are You to have no supremacy in the kingdom of my
   mind? Does any man fancy that his soul can ever be right while this is
   his theory? How can the heart stand in an even place and be at peace
   while it refuses to acknowledge the sway of God? We must yield our
   intellect to the superior intellect, permitting the drop to be borne
   along by the river! The Infallible speech of Him who cannot err must
   satisfy the obedient mind!

   To the true heart there is no self-denial in agreeing that Omniscience
   shall stand instead of personal discovery; Infallible Revelation in the
   place of research and argument and the witnessing Spirit in the place
   of authority and evidence. Every Word of God is surer than the most
   certain deductions of mathematics or the clearest inferences of
   reasoning! God's slightest hint, though it comes not to a positive
   declaration, is to be treasured up by us as a priceless gem! Well does
   the Apostle say, "The foolishness of God is wiser than men." There is
   more light in God's darkness than in man's light! His every Word is
   Infallible, but as for the thoughts of man--we know that they are
   vanity. This seems to be a test, then, by which we may try whether we
   are saved or not. Are we walking humbly with God or not?

   Are we trying to be something, to do something, to think something, or
   in some way or other to let it be manifest that we are not to be
   overlooked? If so, there is great fear that we are not yet right with
   Heaven. God says, "I Am and there is none beside Me." Do we consent to
   shrink into nothingness, or are we eager to cry out, "I, too, am
   something! I must not be ignored, for I have my right and claims which
   may not be forgotten." Beloved, I delight to hear the Divine Voice
   crying, "I Am," and to run and hide myself beneath His eternal wings,
   cowering down beneath them, even as the little chicks hide beneath the
   mother and are as though they were not apart from her. It is good to
   shrink into a happy insignificance, to feel that we are nothing, save
   only as we are hidden away with Christ in God. God Is and as for our
   existence, it is but that of God displaying Himself in us--we are
   nothing--God is All in All.

   When we are thus humbled we are saved. What is it to not be lost? The
   eternal burning of the Divine greatness has consumed the vainglory of
   the creature and that which remains has no cause to fear. With this man
   will God dwell forever on terms of peace, even with him who is of a
   humble and a contrite spirit and trembles at His Word.

   III. I must pass on very briefly to say, in the third place, of walking
   humbly with God, that IT IS A SYMPTOM OF SPIRITUAL HEALTH. You can
   tell, dear Friend, not only whether you are saved, but afterwards,
   whether your new life is in a growing state, by examining whether you
   are walking humbly with God. Let me dwell upon that matter for a
   minute. We are healthy in soul if we have lowly views in reference to
   ourselves upon matters of Divine Grace. Come, now,

   what do you think of yourself this morning? Are you a fine fellow, a
   disciple, indeed, an example to others? Do you now account yourself to
   be a very experienced Christian, quite a useful member of the Church,
   an ornament to society, a person considerably looked up to and well
   worthy of a large measure of respect?

   It would be very improper to put you in a back seat, or invite you to
   take a lower room, for are you not a prince in Israel? Among those who
   might be counted as pillars, you feel that you must be mentioned. But
   be careful what you are thinking! It is very easy to feel great. It is,
   by no means, an eminently difficult thing to be exalted. I have reached
   that point, myself, without great effort and I take no credit, but much
   shame for it. A sense of rising to be somebody is not a sign of
   health--it is a token of the reverse, sometimes, and may be the
   forerunner of most solemn catastrophes. Puffing up may mean bloating
   and swelling with deadly tumors, therefore beware of it!

   Signs of health lie in quite another line. Will you try and follow me,
   for a minute, in a humbling meditation? Remember what you were a little
   while ago. Then, the thought that you would even be a member of the
   Church of Christ seemed too good for you! If anyone had said, "You will
   be numbered with God's people. You will enjoy, with them, the sweets of
   pardoning Grace," you would have said, "Then I do not care where they
   put me. If I am only one of the dogs under the Master's table, I shall
   be perfectly satisfied to eat the crumbs." Like the prodigal, we were
   ready to cry, "Make me as one of Your hired servants!" So long as we
   might but eat the bread from the Father's table we had no care for
   honor.

   Ah, you did not think you would be such a big man as you are now, did
   you? When you filled the swine trough and fed the unclean, yourself
   hungry and faint, you had no idea to what you would grow. God grant you
   may have every particle of boasting removed from you at this time as
   you remember the hole of the pit from which you were quarried! Taken
   from the dunghill and placed among princes, let our grateful hearts
   renounce all self-glory and magnify only the Lord! Another set of
   reflections may rise up on considering what you now are. What are you
   now? At your best--what have you to boast of? You are thought by others
   to be something very great and respectable, but what are the facts of
   the case as God sees them? You are a branch of the true Vine--yes, how
   much fruit do you bear?

   Compare yourself with those branches that bring forth much fruit to
   God--and how thin and lean is your vintage! You are weighed down by the
   responsibilities which your position thrusts upon you, but are you
   bearing them worthily? Are you doing for God what some would do if they
   had your opportunities? Are you doing for Christ what once you thought
   you would do if you ever had the means? Are you now living according to
   your own notion of how a Christian should live--are you anywhere near
   it? Oh, my Brother, when you think of what you are now, there is more
   to make you blush than to make you boast! There is more to make you
   cover your face than to cause you to lift up your head! At least, such
   is my case.

   Once more, I beg you to think of what you would be within a very short
   time if you were left by Divine Grace. We sometimes condemn men for
   their acts and are right in condemning them--and yet if we had been in
   their position we might have done much worse. "Oh," says one, "what a
   mercy it is I have been kept these 30 years and have never dishonored
   my profession!" Yes, Brother, it is a mercy, a great mercy, a greater
   mercy than you dreamed! You do not happen to have a vixen for a wife,
   or a troublesome family, or a provoking neighbor--or you would have
   lost your character long ago. Domestic comfort may deserve more praise
   than any goodness on your part. It is a mercy for you that the evil
   person who used to have such influence over you was taken away, or else
   I do not know where you would have been!

   Many an evil character has been the result of vicious influence. A
   great deal of apparent virtue may be due to our not happening to be
   tempted at the time when we are in a certain condition, or else if our
   tinder and the devil's sparks had met, who knows but what the best of
   us might have been ablaze by now? Oh, how much we owe to preventing
   Grace! We are debtors both to the Providence and the Grace of God which
   have kept us out of harm's way! When sometimes we have been compelled
   to condemn sin in a Brother and to speak very solemnly, as we are bound
   to do, we have remembered ourselves lest we, also, should be
   tempted--and we have remembered that Grace, alone, has kept us out of
   sin. "Such an one was drunk," says one, "after making a profession of
   religion." We do not exonerate him for a moment! It was a shameful
   crime, but oh, my Friend, had you been precisely in his condition--had
   you been once a victim to that degrading vice, met by the same company
   and in other respects surrounded as he was--you might have been
   intoxicated long before he became so!

   Walk humbly with your God at any rate, my Friend. The true way to live
   is to give God all the glory and take to ourselves all the shame. When
   God gives us great temporal enjoyments, then let us think, "Why do I
   have these comforts while many of His servants are without them? Is it
   possible that He is giving me my portion in this life?" That will lay a
   cool hand on your hot forehead and forbid all pride in wealth! If God
   makes you rich, instead of doting on your riches, say to yourself, "How
   can I best use my substance for His Glory?" The working out of that
   practical question should be quite sufficient to keep you from
   self-esteem. He who truly serves the Lord will walk humbly with Him.
   Have you more talent than other people? You will be a great fool if you
   begin to rejoice in it, for serious responsibilities come with special
   ability. Remember you have to do more for God than other people and
   that thought should, by God's Grace, be as ballast for your wide-spread
   sail. Great talent might be a sun to smite you if a sense of
   responsibility did not come in like a cloud to shield you.

   Are you honored among men? Then say to yourself, "Ah, they do not know
   me or they might judge me otherwise. If I deserve their esteem for some
   things, yet there are many things which make me hang my head." If we
   deserve all the gratitude of our fellows, we should still be deeply
   anxious not to take a grain of praise to ourselves lest God should be
   angry with us for robbing Him of His revenue of Glory. What have we
   that we have not received? We must always have lowly views of ourselves
   before God in regard to matters of Grace and it should be the same in
   reference to His Providence. For instance, if one of you shall have
   been much tried in business and have lost much money--suppose you are
   angry with God and quarrel with Him about it--is that walking humbly
   with Him? When we complain at the loss of children or friends, is not
   that the pride of our heart?

   To walk humbly with God would lead you to say, "It is the Lord, let Him
   do what seems good to Him!" But a proud heart virtually cries, "God
   shall do as I like, or else He shall have no obedience from me! He
   shall always use His right hand and pour into my lap all that I desire,
   or else we will part company." It is the hypocrite who will not always
   call upon God--a little trial cools his love. Ah, Friend, this will not
   do. Complaining and rebelling are not walking humbly with God! Humbly
   walking with God yields itself entirely to the Divine will and says,
   "Shall we receive good at the hand of God and shall we not receive
   evil? The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of
   the Lord."

   Humbly walking with God will enable a man to receive Providences from
   God without expecting to understand why they came. "I cannot
   comprehend," says a man, "why, in the very midst of my usefulness, I am
   laid aside." Is God bound to tell you why? When you are denied an
   explanation, are you walking humbly with God? Has the father to tell
   his little son the reason for everything he does? Is that the way you
   govern your family? No, my Brothers, fathers have their honor and much
   more our heavenly Father! God gives no account of His matters. It is a
   part of my humbly walking with God to accept Providences of which I
   cannot see the object or design and to be grateful for them. When God
   sends, as it seems to us, the wrong Providence--when He does to us that
   which seems unwise and unkind, we are still to say, "He must be good to
   Israel and all His dealings must be wise and kind. I am but as a wild
   ass's colt and know nothing and can judge nothing--God knows all
   things, so let His will be done."

   This is to walk humbly with Him. If the Lord turns His hand and
   multiplies your treasure and gives you the bright and sunny days, the
   elastic step and cheery heart, take heed that you walk humbly with Him.
   It is easy to think something of yourself when the purse is bulky--but
   fling away such folly! Hold your possessions loosely and say, "Lord, I
   am grateful for these, but if You, in the future, take them away, by
   Your Grace, I will not murmur. I do not suspend my love to You upon
   these outward things. I love You for Yourself and for Your richer
   Grace. My love is not held by the tenure of Your favoring me with
   health and strength. By Your Grace I will trust You though You slay me.
   Though You take all away, out of the very dust will I still praise
   You."

   I think I have thus shown that it is a symptom of spiritual health when
   a man can walk humbly with God.

   IV. And now, fourthly, we may say of this humble walking that IT IS A
   CAUSE FOR VERY GREAT ANXIETY. We must walk humbly, my Brothers and
   Sisters, but this is more easily said than done. This is no child's
   play! Humility of spirit is a virtue which is likely to be
   overlooked--we pay some attention to doing justly and loving mercy, but
   walking humbly with God is so inward, so ethereal and so spiritual that
   we are apt to overlook it--yet it is the main thing and all our
   thoughts should go to the securing of it. You may, if you will, give
   all your substance to the poor and your bodies to be burned, but if you
   walk not humbly with God you have missed the essence of godliness.

   It is easy enough to keep up private devotion and family devotion and
   public devotion and to be regular at sacraments and sermons and to be
   everything that is moral and just and upright and yet, after all, to
   not be walking humbly with God and, therefore, a failure here is highly
   probable, but none the less terrible. Humble walking is so difficult to
   come at that thousands sit down content with that which looks like it,
   but is by no means the same thing. It is so easy to think yourself
   humble. To feign humility is, of all things, most shocking and yet to
   be truly humble is, of all things, most difficult. Have you never
   noticed how, when you fancied you were lowly before God, it was only
   that you were unbelieving or out of health? Do not mistake indigestion
   for humility!

   When you said to yourself, "Now I am on familiar terms with God and
   living near Him in communion," it turned out to be presumption rather
   than faith. And supposed humility has, in like manner, full often
   condensed into despair. Are you now saying, "I think I am humble"? Is
   there ever a time when a man is so proud as when he judges that he is
   humble? "Ah," you say, "but I cannot exalt myself, I am in such a
   condition of heart I must walk humbly with God." My Beloved, I beseech
   you to be more on your guard, now, than ever, against pride, for a
   haughty spirit lurks in an assurance of humility like a lion in its
   den! The leaven of self is brought into our meal in the measure of a
   supposed necessity of humbleness. To be really lowly, really nothing
   before God, really to yield yourselves up to Him--this is such a work
   and such a difficulty that I commend you to attempt it in order that
   you may see how impossible it is to you apart from the power of the
   Holy Spirit, who, alone, can help us to walk humbly with God.

   V. With this I close, when I have said, in the fifth place, in praise
   of walking humbly with God, that IT IS THE SOURCE OF THE DEEPEST
   CONCEIVABLE PLEASURE. If you walk humbly with God you will feel safe.
   What can harm the man who sits at the feet of the great Lord and waits
   on His will? Ah, now you feel that, happen what may, nothing can harm
   you, for you are ready to bow before it and let the Lord, alone, reign.
   What peace it gives when you feel that if there is anything about you
   which grieves your God, you will gladly let it go--you have already
   surrendered it-- you would not retain it for an hour! The tempest rolls
   overhead but all is calm below when the heart has learned full
   surrender and is even as a weaned child. Your spirit must rest,
   then--it cannot help resting--for it dwells in God!

   Into this quietness and rest there comes enjoyment, for the man that
   leaves everything to God finds joy in everything. Mercies which to
   others are commonplace are sweet to him. He marvels at the love which
   God displays in them all! As mercies come to him, he receives them with
   songs of thankfulness. He is grateful to think that he has bread to eat
   and clothes to wear, for he knows how unworthy he is. And when great
   mercies are showered on him, he sits down before God and cries, "Why
   this to me? What am I and what is my father's house?" He is the man who
   joins Mary in her Magnificat, singing, "My soul does magnify the Lord."

   He sings with the Psalmist, "Bless the Lord, O my Soul and all that is
   within me bless His holy name." He sits at Heaven's gate waiting to
   enter and he shall not long be detained outside, for as joy and peace
   and a heavenly mind have come to him, so shall they soon bring him to
   their Home. He who has learned to walk humbly with God shall soon see
   the face of God in His Glory! God teach us all this sacred art for
   Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.

Rare Fruit

   (No. 1558)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace." Isaiah 57:19.

   "THE fruit of the lips"! The lips are neither trees of the orchard nor
   herbs of the garden. What fruit can they bear? The scattering of Babel
   came of human speech when languages were multiplied and the united race
   split up into fragments. Wars and fighting and hatred and bloodshed
   have sprung of talk and bluster--these are deadly fruits, the very
   mention of which brings pain to the heart--surely it is in vain to look
   for much that is worth gathering from mouths and tongues! Great talkers
   are proverbially little doers and the more talk, the less work. We may
   come for years looking for fruit on this fig tree and find none.
   "Nothing but leaves" will be gathered by those who look to the lips for
   a harvest to fill the barn. This is most true. It you let the lips
   alone, they produce mischief and trouble and not much else.

   An unrenewed tongue is almost worse than an unregenerate heart because,
   bad as the heart may be, there is heart in it--the tongue is often
   heartless--a mere sounding sham with no reality to support its bronze
   noise. Too many speak with the lips and their heart is not in what they
   say. If the lips become the instruments of hypocrisy and if the fruit
   of the lips is only the fruit of the lips, it is comparable to the
   apples of Sodom. The lips, moreover, cause pain and evil all around,
   which the heart, alone, cannot do. The heart is as an oven closed up.
   The tongue is a fire raging abroad, setting on flame the course of
   nature when it is, itself, set on fire by Hell.

   The lips of the wicked are like the upas tree which drips poison. We
   could readily dispense with the fruit of the lips as it comes from
   uncircumcised and unclean lips. Go out and gather a basketful of the
   fruit of the lips--gossiping, bickering, fault-finding, murmuring,
   nonsense, vanity, falsehood, boasting, infidelity. I will not tell you
   all that I might put into that basket! Certainly, if it were to be
   shred and poured out into the broth of daily life, we would soon have
   to say as they did who threw the wild cucumber into the pottage, "O man
   of God, there is death in the pot!" The fruit of the lips tends to
   vanity, to poverty, to sorrow, to shame, to death. The fruit of the
   lips is just what the root of an unrenewed, unregenerate heart causes
   it to be.

   You remember AEsop and how wisely he kept his master's command when he
   bade him provide for dinner the best things he could and when they came
   together he set out tongues--nothing else but tongues! His master was
   pleased with his wit, though I am afraid the guests did not relish it
   and he ordered him, the next time, to provide for dinner the worst
   things he possibly could. Tongues again--nothing else but tongues!
   Truly AEsop was wise there, for the fruit of the lips is sometimes the
   best thing in the world and sometimes the worst thing in the world--it
   is a blessing and a curse-- according to the man whose tongue speaks.
   The fruit of the lips may be compared to Jeremiah's figs--the good,
   very good, but the bad, exceedingly bad, exceedingly ripe figs that
   cannot be eaten. Fruit of the lips, what shall I say about you? It
   might seem that the less we said the better, lest in our case, also,
   the fruit of the lips should add to the useless heap!

   Our text tells us that God creates the fruit of the lips, but this must
   be understood, of course, with reservation. He does not create the
   fruit of the lips as we commonly see it, but the good fruit, the true
   fruit, the fruit worth gathering-- that which should be the fruit of
   the lips--of this God is the Creator. The natural fruit is so evil it
   needs the Creator, again, to step in and make us new creatures and our
   fruit new, also, or else it would remain so bad that the verdict upon
   it would be, "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity." And what is that
   fruit which the Creator produces from a source which is naturally so
   barren? First of all, it is the sacrifice of thanksgiving--"the fruit
   of our lips giving thanks to His name" (Heb. 13:15).

   The fruit of the lips which God creates should be, above all things,
   praise. We ought to delight to praise God--it should be our element,
   our occupation, our recreation, our very life! We are as much and as
   evidently intended to praise God as angels are. When I look at a bird,
   if I study it awhile, I am convinced that it was made to sing. When we
   look at

   an angel and study his formation and character, we are certain that he
   was ordained to praise God. And he that studies man, if he can see
   beyond the defects which the Fall has brought upon every organ, will be
   forced to see that he is a creature adapted for the praise of God. Our
   tongue is the glory of our frame and it is given us that we may give
   glory to Him who framed it! Articulate speech, which is denied to birds
   and beasts, is given to us for this major reason--that we may
   articulately and distinctly praise and magnify the name of the Most
   High.

   O Man, however eloquent in oratory or charming in song your lips may
   be, they are fruitless if you do not extol your Maker with them! Your
   lips are as dry Sahara sand, or as the salt deserts where not a blade
   of grass can live, if from them there never springs the sweet flower of
   gratitude to God, fragrantly expressing itself in words of love. Your
   lips should drop honey as the honeycomb--a gentle dew of thankfulness
   should distil from them! They should be like the rose, sending forth
   perpetual perfume! Each word should be a fragrant leaf, scattering a
   sweet smell of adoration. The lips should be the gates of thankfulness
   and from between them there should continually pour forth a wealthy
   traffic of song bearing abroad the products of a grateful heart worked
   in the forges of glowing thankfulness to God.

   Another fruit of the lips should never be forgotten and that is prayer.
   This should be the fruit of renewed manhood at every age--the lips of
   little children can compass prayer and the mouth of the aged may not
   fail to utter it. This is a God-created fruit! He that abounds in it is
   as a vine which God has blessed. Woe unto the mouth which is silent at
   the Mercy Seat, for it will, one day, be dumb at the Judgment Seat!
   Those lips are cursed that never pray! Those lips shall blister with
   unutterable pain that never pray! "Behold, he prays," is an absolutely
   necessary sign of the possession of Divine Grace in the heart. True
   praise never flowered from those lips upon which prayer has never
   blossomed. You can be sure of this, that prayer and praise are grapes
   of the same cluster and the lips which are barren of the one are bare
   of the other. These two fruits of the lips, God creates wherever His
   Grace enters.

   Furthermore, when there is prayer and praise in us, another fruit of
   the lip is testimony. Do you produce this, dear Friends? Has God
   created it from your lips? It is the bearing witness to others of what
   God can do because you have received it in your own experience. God
   blesses us on purpose that we may tell other poor souls how He can
   bless the sons of men! And yet there are Christians--at least I hope
   they are Christians--who appear to have received great mercy from God
   but they keep the matter hidden. Oh, be not such, I pray you! If you
   have good tidings in your heart, bring forth the fruit of the lips and
   tell it. "I would stammer," says one. There is a great beauty in the
   stammering of earnestness! "I could never be eloquent," says another.
   Yet there is much true eloquence where there is no appearance of it!

   It matters not when a man cannot speak his heart, if you can read in
   his face that he would speak with the tongues of angels if he could,
   for he feels that his theme transcends his utmost ability. Fine words
   are not forceful--it is the heart which prevails. Tell your neighbor
   that Jesus died. Tell your neighbor that Jesus came into the world to
   save sinners. Tell your neighbor he is welcome to Christ--tell your
   neighbor Christ has saved you! Do not hesitate to tell him of your own
   tasting and handling of the good Word of Life, for this is a most
   profitable fruit of the lips! What is more likely to prevail with a man
   than brotherly testimony? How can we so surely attract men to Canaan as
   by showing its Eshcol clusters, setting them forth with earnest speech,
   as the Holy Spirit enables us?

   These discourses of mine are the fruit of my lips. I cannot tell you
   how much I wish they were more worthy of my Master's honor, but, such
   as they are, you all have the benefit of them and they lay you under an
   obligation to yield your fruit unto others. I am not called to bear
   witness alone and when I have borne my fruit and you are refreshed, it
   is your bounden duty to go and bring forth the same fruit for the
   refreshment of others.

   Thus much about the threefold fruit of the lips. Now, there is one
   renowned topic upon which the lips ought always to be able to speak and
   that blessed subject is summed up in the two words of my text, "Peace,
   peace." "I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace." The lips ought
   to be occupied with the subject of peace. This should be their breath.
   As Saul breathed out threats, so should we breathe out peace and yet
   again, peace--a double peace from our two lips. From the mouth of truth
   should come kisses of peace, words of peace, the breath of peace. This
   is the best lip-salve--"Peace, peace." Nothing can so sweeten the
   breath as "Peace, peace." Nothing can so flavor the palate and delight
   the heart as this "Peace, peace," felt within and breathed without.

   No teeth of ivory, nor lips of coral are complete in loveliness till
   there glistens over all the brightness of peace! Fierce speech becomes
   not loveliness. Threats and clamor destroy beauty. The charm of the
   lips is peace. So I am going to take

   those two words and recommend them to you as a fruit of the lips which
   God creates. May the Lord help us all to go out of this place with this
   on our lips--"Peace, peace."

   I. We shall employ these words in four ways and we shall commence by
   using them as THE CRY OF THE AWAKENED. When men are awakened, by the
   Grace of God, into a consciousness of their true condition, they find
   themselves at war with God and at war with their own consciences and
   consequently they begin to cry, "Peace, peace"-- eagerly longing to end
   the dreadful conflict in which they find themselves engaged. While a
   man is dead in trespasses and sins-- where Nature left him and where
   the devil keeps him--he has a deadly calm of mind. He is not troubled.
   He has no bonds in his death, should he die, nor none in his life while
   he is drunk with sin. He is like a brute beast, looking no further than
   to the pasture in which he feeds--he lives for the present and, as long
   as his bodily needs are satisfied, he is content.

   When the Spirit of God awakens thoughts of higher things in him, the
   whole matter is changed. He thinks of God and laments that he has
   forgotten his Maker. He thinks of that Maker's Law and perceives that
   he has constantly broken it. Indeed, he has never regarded it, but
   treated it as a thing of nothing. He thinks of death and he says, "I
   must die, but I am unprepared." He thinks of eternity, of that other
   world--that lasting world beyond time--that world where we must dwell
   forever and he cries, "Where shall I dwell? Where will my portion be?"
   He feels it cannot be among the sanctified, for he is not one of them.
   He cannot hope to see the face of God with joy, for he has never sought
   that face, nor cared for the knowledge of God's ways.

   As He begins thinking of these high themes, conscience sets before his
   mind the Day of Judgment. He sees the heavens on fire and the great
   Judge calling all men to account--and he is sorely troubled. He sees
   Heaven open and all its Glory, but he fears that he will be excluded,
   for he has been a rebel against the Lord! He looks down to Hell with
   all its terror and it seems to gape for him, as for one most suitable
   to be its everlasting prey! Do you wonder, then, if the man is
   tormented with internal strife and with horror of a war without? He has
   no rest and he cries, "Peace, peace"--the cry only echoes in his ears,
   for what peace can there be for him? Very likely a worldling comes
   along and says, "You are melancholy. Do not give way to such low
   spirits. I count it one of the wisest things to drive dull care away.
   Come with me where they make merry."

   He goes, but, someway or other he sees that all the gold is gilt and
   all the finery is flimsy and that there is nothing in the mirth. The
   sport is tame and dull to him and he is duller than ever. He does not
   enjoy what once was the delight of his eyes. He leaves and when they
   ask him to visit their haunts, again, he says, "No, no. My heart seems
   heavier there than when I am alone." "As vinegar upon niter, so is he
   that sings songs to a sad heart." There is no suitability in worldly
   merry-making to ease a tortured spirit. The awakened sinner cries,
   "Peace, peace! Oh that I had peace!" Then there visits him one who
   knowingly whispers, "You need not disturb yourself. These things are
   not so. Do you not know that these are all bugbears of a past
   generation? We men of modern thought have made great discoveries and
   changed all the fears of our benighted ancestors into a brave unbelief!
   You can live at ease. Do not fret yourself about sin, or Heaven, or
   Hell, or eternity."

   Vain are these stale skepticisms! The man is too much in earnest to be
   drugged with such soporifics. Boastful unbelief has small power over an
   agonized soul! God Himself has convinced this man of sin, of
   righteousness and of judgment and though he tries to disbelieve he
   cannot! Conviction haunts him, follows him into his chamber, robs him
   of his rest and he cries, "I gladly would be an unbeliever if I could,
   but I cannot! Oh that I had peace! Oh that I had peace!" Mr. Worldly
   Wiseman calls upon him, with his friend, Dr. Legality and his
   assistant-surgeon, Mr. Civility--and these try their Balm of Conceit
   and Plaster of Natural Goodness. Dr. Legality finds his patient
   disturbed with the threats of the Gospel and the doctrines of Holy Writ
   and he says, "These things are quite true, but you need not worry
   because you have not been so bad as a great many!

   "And if it goes hard with you, it will go very hard with most of the
   people. You are all right, for you have been honest, obliging, generous
   and religious." Yes, but if God has been dealing with this man, he will
   say, "But I am not all right. I feel that I deserve the wrath of God
   and that goodness is not in me. You may think it is so, but I know
   myself and 1 have looked into my heart and I find all manner of evil
   there. Oh that I had peace! Oh that I had peace!" Self-righteousness is
   too short a bed for an awakened sinner to stretch himself on--neither
   can flatterers cajole him into a peace based upon forgetfulness of the
   Divine Law. Then comes a priest and he exclaims," Come with us and
   undergo ceremonies and take sacraments and we will ease you of your
   burden."

   Perhaps the poor man tries this, but though he tries it, he finds no
   rest whatever. No, the leprosy lies deep within and no outward form can
   cleanse away the deep-seated pollution. The burden presses on his heart
   and, therefore, no manipulation of outward rites can remove the heavy
   load from him. His cry is, "Peace, peace, peace, peace! Oh that I could
   get it! Oh that I could get it! I would search through earth and sea
   and air and Hell, itself, if I might find it and bless the grave if it
   would give it to me." Dear Heart, I sympathize with you. I remember
   when I would have gone to the utmost verge of this green earth if I
   could have found peace. I tell you, racks and tortures I would have
   boldly endured! Prisons and dungeons I would have bravely entered and
   battle and death I would have gladly encountered if I could have found
   peace from my accusing conscience!

   But I found none. I was like that serpent which is said to sting itself
   to death. "My thoughts," as George Herbert says, "were all a case of
   knives." Every motion of my mind seemed to drive a dagger into my
   heart! A volcano had burst up within my soul and the burning lava of
   despair flowed over all. I was no fool, nor was I under a delusion. I
   think I was never saner than at that dread period of my life--certainly
   I was never more seriously in earnest! I was not a simpleton scared of
   his own shadow, but I had cause to be disquieted, for actual guilt was
   upon me--not that I was worse than others in outward sin--but that I
   had such a sight and sense of my guiltiness that I could only cry out,
   "Woe is me! Oh, wretched man that I am!"

   Then my daily prayer was, "Peace, peace!" but I could not find it. This
   is a good cry, however, for every awakened spirit. I would put it into
   the mouth of every penitent--rather may the Lord Himself create it
   there as the fruit of the lips. "Peace, peace."

   II. Secondly, our theme is much more cheerful when we see that this is
   THE ANSWER OF THE SAVIOR. It is the fruit of the Savior's lips, whose
   lips are as lilies dropping sweet smelling myrrh. It is He that comes
   to a soul and says, "Peace, peace." Oh, did you ever see Him as dying
   of sin? If you have never seen Him with the eyes of faith, you do not
   know what peace means. After this fashion He shows Himself. He looks
   upon the sinner, troubled and tossed to and fro and He says, "What ails
   you?" "My sin," says the sinner, "has utterly condemned me." "Do you
   not know that I bore it 1,800 years ago and more, in My own body on the
   Cross?" "Yes, Lord, I have heard that You did something of the kind,
   but did You bear it so that I need not bear it?"

   Then the Redeemer shows that He bore the burden of guilt effectually
   and carried it away into the land of forgetful-ness and, moreover, He
   makes clear the Truth of God that if He took our sin, it can never be
   laid on us, for it is not consistent with the Father's justice, first
   to punish the Substitute for sin, and then to punish the offender,
   also. That were to make a mockery of Christ Jesus by making Him a
   Substitute and then punishing those for whom He stood as a Surety! Do
   you see that, poor Soul? Is it not clear enough that if the Surety is
   sued for the debt and is made to discharge it, the original debtor is
   free? Rest in the fact that this is the Believer's case. "But," says
   the heart, "my Lord, I know that You did die. I see Your wounds, I mark
   Your open side, but tell me, did You die for me in particular?" "Will
   you trust Me, Soul? Will you trust Me wholly?"

   "Ah, that I will, my Lord!" "Then I bore your sin. I was punished in
   your place. Your iniquity has ceased to be. Your sins I have cast into
   the depths of the sea. Your transgression shall never be mentioned
   against you again forever! Go and sin no more. Peace, peace!" What can
   break a peace like this? Why need I fret about sin which is hurled into
   oblivion? Why should I despair because of my guilt and reckon myself
   condemned? I am not condemned, for Jesus was condemned for me--even He
   in whom my spirit fixes all her trust. He paid my debts and discharged
   my liability to Justice and, therefore, my soul is clear. Peace, peace!
   Was there ever peace like this? Glory be to my Redeemer for such rest!
   Truly God has given us this repose--

   "O You who did Your Glory leave

   Apostate sinners to retrie ve

   From Nature's deadly fall,

   You have purchased me with a price,

   Nor shall my crimes in judgment rise,

   For You have borne them all."

   But did you ever see Christ as He is risen from the dead? Here is
   another vision of consolation, another fountain of peace. The poor
   heart lies prostrate at the Savior's feet and cries, "I see You, my
   Lord! I see how You have put away my sin and I am at peace! But alas, I
   am a poor fool and shall sin again and I have a wayward, wandering
   heart that will soon

   be away over the mountains leaping into sin again. How can I hope to
   enter Heaven?" To this the Lord Jesus replies most sweetly, "Do you not
   know that I am risen from the dead? I am He that lives, though once I
   died for sin. I am that great Shepherd who lives to take care of His
   own flock. Because I live, you shall live, also. I am able also to save
   them to the uttermost that come unto God by Me, seeing I always live to
   make intercession for them."

   Do you know the peace which the Resurrection of the Lord Jesus brings
   into the spirit? If so, you find rich fruit hanging upon Jesus' lips.
   He who knows the virtue of the living Lord, at once concludes that the
   future is as safe as the past! The slain Savior has slain our past sins
   and the living Savior lives to take care of our eternal life and to
   bring us to God's right hand at the last. See how Jesus says, "Peace,
   peace, peace! All is well." Did you ever see Jesus as He sits there
   triumphant at the Lord God's right hand? I hope you have, because a
   poor, tried spirit is greatly comforted by that sight. The downcast one
   exclaims, "My Lord, I know You will take care of me here, for I
   perceive that You live to provide for me. But I shall have to die and
   what shall I do then? My Lord, I am afraid to die! It is grim
   work--dying. It is a path I never trod before. What shall I do in the
   swellings of Jordan?"

   Jesus answers such fears in His own sweet fashion by saying, "Do you
   not know that I am risen from the dead and that I have gone into Glory
   to prepare a place for you? I will come to you at the last and I will
   take your spirit away to dwell with Me forever. You need not fear to
   die, for he that lives and believes in Me shall never die. He that
   believes in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. I will help
   you. Death shall be no death to you! I will take your soul away and you
   shall never know it till you see Me face to face! As for your poor
   dust, it shall lie in the grave a little while, but I will take care of
   every atom of it and when I shall descend on the Last Day, My archangel
   shall sound his trumpet and your poor body shall rise again, only more
   fair and beautiful than when you had it in its best estate below--and
   so you shall be forever with Me, both as to body and soul." Does not
   this breathe, "Peace, peace, peace"?--

   "Surely the last end

   Of the good man is peace!

   How calm his exit!

   Night dews fall not more

   Calmly on the ground,

   Nor weary worn out winds

   Expire so softly."

   If I were to go on picturing our glorious Lord Jesus Christ in any and
   all of His relationships to us, we should, in each case, hear Him say,
   "Peace, peace." His voice is the sovereign balm which heals every
   wound, the cordial which removes every fear! No distress or amazement
   can seize upon you for which, in Christ, there is not a peace that
   passes all understanding to keep your heart and soul against all dread.
   This is the fruit of the lips of the Well-Beloved--peace, peace, peace.
   If you do not come to Him, you will receive no peace! If you do not
   stay near Him, you will retain no peace! And if you do not come
   growingly nearer and nearer to Him, you will miss much of the peace
   that you might have had. Abide in Christ Jesus and let Him abide in you
   and you shall have abundance of peace so long as the moon endures!.

   A soldier in the Crimean war, as he lay dying, was visited by a worthy
   Missionary. The young man asked his visitor to read a chapter to him
   and the chapter chosen was John 14. When he came to this verse--"Peace
   I leave with you," the soldier was almost in the throes of death, but
   he said to the reader, "Sir, that is the peace which I enjoy. I have
   had it for years." "Peace I leave with you." "Now," he said, "if I have
   known this peace--and I have had it for years--I shall not lose it now,
   but shall die triumphantly." And so he did! Can you, my Hearer, say
   tonight that you have that peace? If you have it now, you shall have it
   in your dying hour!

   Could you say what Dr. Watts said to his host, Sir Thomas Abney? He
   said, "Sir Thomas, I thank God that for many a month I have been able
   to say, 'It is a matter of perfect indifference to me, when I fall
   asleep at night, whether I wake up in this world or in another.'" I
   well remember reading the old story of a Methodist who was pressed into
   the army some 50 or 60 years ago who had his leg carried away in battle
   and lay bleeding on the ground. When they carried him off the field, he
   said, "I am as happy as a man can be while out of Heaven." They said he
   was mad! O for more of such glorious madness! To be able to say, when
   your limb is shot away and you are bleeding away your life, "I am as
   happy as a man can be out of Heaven," why there is something in that!

   This must be the finger of God! Where else can such triumph over pain
   and weakness be found? What voice but that of Jesus can, in such a
   storm, command a heavenly calm? Jesus, Master, whose message to Your
   people is always, "Peace,

   peace," speak that Divine Word to me and to all your troubled ones!
   Stand in our midst and say, "Peace be unto you," and peace shall be
   ours!

   III. Thirdly, I am going to use these words as THE SONG OF THE TRUE
   BELIEVER. He who has really seen Christ and placed his trust in Him,
   can now sing, "Peace, peace, peace." What a thrice accursed thing is
   war! I believe with Benjamin Franklin that there never was a good war
   and there never was a bad peace. War is unmitigated mischief from end
   to end and peace is a thing to rejoice in, take it in whatever light
   you will. Killing and slaying, devastating and burning are sport for
   fiends and for fiends, alone! True men, if once called to battle, are
   the last persons who would lightly enter upon it again. It is an awful
   and terrible thing.

   I remember reading that when the last great war was over--I mean the
   greatest war of all, in which we were so long engaged with the
   Bonapartes--news of the peace came to a certain town. It was only
   gently whispered that there was peace, but it was all over the town in
   a few minutes! Everybody ran through the streets! Bread had been sent
   up to an awful price by the war and everybody was weary with the taxes,
   the slaughter of soldiers and the perpetual fear of invasion. A man ran
   down the street shouting, "Peace, peace, peace, peace," and everybody
   was glad! All manner of good things were wrapped up in the one word,
   "peace"--families would no longer be divided, trade would no longer be
   crippled, famine would no more devour the land. Now the loaf would be
   within the reach of the poor and the hungry--and the widow might keep
   her sons at home, safe from the cannon's mouth. "Peace, peace," they
   cried and within an hour there were bells ringing from every steeple
   and as the sun went down there were candles in every window! Everybody
   must have an illumination because peace had come!

   Now, if peace is so precious as to temporal things, it is equally
   precious as to eternal things! And if a man has once seen Jesus Christ,
   it is the joy of his life to sing, "Peace, peace." Here stands the
   reconciled man and he looks up to Heaven through the pure blue air,
   past yon stars, endless leagues beyond imagination's utmost stretch! He
   looks up and his mind conceives of God and his heart feels, "I am at
   peace with Him. Though He is a consuming fire, I am at peace with Him!
   With the great Father I am at peace! Though it is very tempestuous
   round about Him, yet I am at peace with Him. I am at peace with the
   eternal Son! Though He shall break His enemies with a rod of iron, He
   will never break me--I am at peace with Him. I am at peace with the
   Holy Spirit, for though to blaspheme Him is death without hope of
   mercy, yet I am at peace with Him--He will never destroy me."

   What a peace this is--peace with God, the peace of God, perfect peace!
   Having this peace, every angel is my friend, every cherub is my
   guardian and all the hosts in glittering ranks above--of angelic
   spirits and unfallen and of human spirits saved and washed in the
   blood--all are my friends, for I have peace with the armies of Heaven
   if I have peace with the Lord of Hosts! How delightful to look all
   around you and to feel confident that Providence is on your side! The
   wheels are stupendous and the results that come of their revolution are
   mysterious and terrible--but let the wheels revolve--they cannot hurt a
   child of God! All things work together for good to them that love God,
   to them that are the called according to His purpose!

   There is peace in all events when there is peace with Heaven. The
   beasts of the field are in league with us and the stones of the field
   are at peace with us when we are at peace with God! It is most sweet to
   feel that wherever you are, everything is at peace with you--and then
   to look inside into this little world where there once raged such
   fierce battles and there, also, to feel the sprinkled blood--this, this
   is JOY! Conscience is quiet, fear has subsided, the deadly dread is
   gone, all is quiet and all is well! To feel that you have forgiven
   every enemy if you have any--that you do not bear a recollection of an
   injury--this also is a brave easement of the heart. As the tablets of
   the Romans, when they had written upon the wax, were afterwards rolled
   over with a hot iron to produce a complete erasure, so by Grace we are
   enabled to smooth out of the soul every angry line and to begin life
   anew as to our fellow men!

   Revenge and malice are unknown among true Christians. I have no more
   memory of ill towards any man that lives than an unborn babe. This is a
   clear atmosphere to live in! How different from the thunder-charged air
   of envy, malice and hate! "You shall go out with joy and be led forth
   with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you
   into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands."
   Blessed are the men who live in this peace--peace of God's giving!
   Peace of the Holy Spirit's working! Peace above and peace below, peace
   within and peace around--peace, peace--the blessed fruit of the lips!

   IV. I close by using my text in a fourth way, practically, by saying
   that this should be THE MOTTO OF EVERY BELIEVER. It has been his song
   for himself--now let it be his motto in dealing with other people. This
   should be his spirit and desire in the Church--"Peace, peace." I thank
   God that we have enjoyed peace as a Church these many years, but I have
   known certain Churches where peace would be a novelty--a novelty which
   I recommend them to try! Some little Churches seem to think that they
   must have an angry discussion every month or else they are living
   beneath their Gospel privileges. This leads to heart-burnings and
   promotes splits and divisions and these are as frequent among them as
   fights at an Irish wake.

   They need a new minister every now and then, for they consider their
   lack of prosperity to be the minister's fault-- and then they need a
   fresh set of deacons, for the evil is thought to be the deacons' fault.
   By-and-by they discover that some leading man, or, what is worse, some
   leading woman, is at the bottom of the evil and they must get rid of
   him or her and then all will go right! And so they practice the process
   of dismemberment--cutting off one part of the body and then another
   till they think the smaller they become the better they will be. What a
   mistake! Do they think to find peace by breaking into pieces? The more
   Christians are divided, the more they can subdivide and the smaller the
   sect, the more prepared is it for another schism.

   Brothers and Sisters, whenever you fall to quarrelling I shall know
   that the Spirit of God has gone from you! Up to now we have put up with
   one another very well, by God's Grace, and I hope we shall continue to
   do so. I do not suppose you ever thought that I was perfect--if you
   did, you did not know much about me! I knew very well that you are not
   perfect. I never flattered you from the very beginning and, therefore,
   I am not disappointed in you. We have gone on wonderfully well with
   each other, considering how imperfect we are--and I trust that the
   Grace of God, which has kept so large a multitude together in love and
   peace--will continue to do it, to His Glory.

   Now, especially when I am away, if any enemy brings strange fire to set
   the Church alight with it, I pray you who are older and wiser than
   others to keep your buckets full of water and stand ready to quench the
   first spark of ill feeling. You, good Brothers and Sisters, who are
   rather fond of talking, if you see a little blaze beginning, leave off
   your talking, for fear you should be adding fuel to the flame! Do not
   repeat what you have heard against a Brother, but ring the curfew and
   cover the fire. Pull the logs all apart and throw the holy water of
   love over the hot ashes! Do not let the fire of anger burn. Why should
   we? We have to live together in Heaven forever--we may as well enjoy
   happy fellowship here! May the Lord grant us to feel the force of those
   heavenly principles which will enable us to live in peace and quiet for
   many and many a year to come!

   I would like every member of the Church to go about saying within
   himself, "Peace, peace. I am a peace-maker in the Church and if I ever
   must be a peace-breaker, it shall not be in the House of God, among the
   family of the Lord Jesus." We should labor to carry out the same quiet
   spirit in the family. When you get home, do not change, "Peace, peace,"
   into scolding and nagging. "If it is possible, as much as lies in you,
   live peaceably with all men." The Apostle says, "If it is possible,"
   because he knew that it would be a very difficult thing, always to be
   peaceable with everybody, for some people are so unreasonable that they
   are never at peace till they are at war and never quiet till they are
   making a disturbance. Be it ours under great provocation still to cry,
   "Peace, peace."

   Put up with a great deal--bear and bear and bear and bear and bear--I
   have not time to repeat the word 70 times seven! They will most surely
   conquer who can most completely submit, for in this world, he that
   would be greatest must be least and he that can stoop the lowest shall
   rise the highest! I do not think there is much in a heritage worth
   fighting for compared with brotherly unity. Family peace and love are
   worth more than a disputed will can ever yield. The game of quarrelling
   is not worth the candle. When I have had to compose family differences,
   I have usually found that the misunderstanding began about nothing and
   went on about nothing--and yet the mischief done is frequently
   terrible. When I have to make peace, I like to have some real injury,
   injustice, or wrong to deal with--something that I can handle, judge
   and condemn--an invisible, misty, indefinable suspicion is hard to
   overcome.

   When there is nothing in the squabble, peace-making is difficult work.
   There is a great tingle-tangle over nothing. You cannot get at it. It
   is a sort of stinging jellyfish which you feel but cannot grasp! Loving
   bonds are broken and there is ill-blood between Christian men and
   Christian women who ought to love one another and all about--about--
   nothing! Now, you Christian people, go about with this as your
   password--"Peace, peace, peace, peace." This will quiet the worst
   scolding of a wife that ever wearied a man--peace, peace! This will
   sober the most outrageous husband that

   ever tried a woman--peace, peace! Cultivate peace in the home garden
   whatever you do elsewhere. When peace reigns in your own family, go
   into the world with the same watchword--"Peace, peace." Do not set dogs
   by the ears, but tame lions and tigers! Compose differences and make
   people friends.

   If certain persons were dropped into the Garden of Eden, they would be
   the serpent in it! But there are others who, if you were to set them
   down in a village distracted with strife and contention, they would be
   lumps of love to sweeten every bitterness. Try and be just such.
   Members of the Tabernacle, especially, let your motto always be,
   "Peace, peace," among your neighbors, for the Glory of God! What a
   difference there will be when this is taken up among all Christian
   denominations--when there shall be no more envying and strife between
   this denomination and that, but each one shall be saying in Christ's
   name, "We are Brethren--peace, peace." How silly it is for one clique
   of good people to be setting up Mr. So-and-So as "the greatest preacher
   that ever lived." How idle for others to reply, "No, he is not.
   So-and-so preaches

   better."

   Let all this be silenced while we cry, "Peace, peace!" None of us who
   are ministers preach as well as we ought to do and none of you who are
   hearers live as you ought to live. When you hear anything like crying
   up of such poor mortals as we are, cry, "Peace, peace," to such
   nonsense! We are all servants of one Master--and may the Lord make us
   all better servants! Let peace ring the death-knell of petty jealousies
   and may all the saints be visibly one in Christ Jesus! May the day come
   when, all the world over, there shall be peace! Peace to Afghan and to
   Zulu, as it is today to Prussian and to Frenchman and to Englishman.
   Let us wish "Peace, peace" to all born of woman.

   May this blessed word be rung out as a clarion note beneath these
   heavens till men shall recognize that they make one family and God is
   the one great Father! You nations, learn war no more! "Peace, peace,
   peace." Catch the words, you winds, and carry them--"Peace, peace,
   peace!" Hear the words, you stars, and shine them out tonight--"Peace,
   peace." Rise up, O sun, in the morning and over all rejoicing lands
   pour forth, with your light and warmth, peace and quietness! May peace
   be with you, my Brothers and Sisters, now and forever. Amen and amen!

Tokens For Good

   (No. 1559)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Show me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it and be
   ashamed: because You, Lord, have helped me and comforted me." Psalm
   86:17.

   I WOULD have you note, beloved Friends, at the outset, how this man of
   God, in the hour of conflict, looks to his Divine Protector. He does
   not run about to consult with friends, nor does he set himself down to
   digest his bitter sorrow in solitude, but he gets away to the Lord, his
   God, who has covenanted to help him. That same God who in his brightest
   days was his great joy, is, in his darkest night, his surest
   consolation. Therefore he cries, "Lord, show me a token for good. Show
   it! Let it come from You. All other signs and tokens I can forego, but
   You show me a token for good and my spirit will be revived at once."
   You see, he looks away from the secondary to the Primary, from the
   temporal to the Eternal--from that which he could see with his eyes--to
   Him whom, having not seen, he trusted and rejoiced in.

   mourner, learn wisdom from the father of the wisest of men! We need not
   hesitate to copy the pattern set by the man after God's own heart! O
   you who are surrounded by persecutors, will you not imitate David? You
   cannot do better in every adversity than to look unto the Lord, the
   Ever-Merciful! I know you have been casting about to the right and to
   the left to find an anchor-hold and still the vessel drifts. Now, throw
   the great bower anchor into the depths! Let it go right down out of
   sight and let it get a grip upon eternal faithfulness and your ship
   shall outride both wind and tide!

   Trust the quicksand of human confidence no longer. Look only to the
   Lord! It is a severance from man, a complete deliverance from the arm
   of flesh that God designs by our trouble and the sooner we come to it
   the better for us. Certainly we shall the more quickly obtain the
   benefit designed by our trouble and probably we shall the sooner come
   to the end of it--

   "Trust with a faith untiring In your Omniscient King, And you shall see
   admiring

   What He to light will bring!

   Of all your griefs the reason

   Shall at the last appear;

   Though hidden for a season It will shine in letters clear."

   Observe that in the case of David, all his troubles drove him to his
   God. I have noticed in the case of too many professors that they seem
   to have a fair-weather religion, a summer-season faith which shrinks
   and loses its color in a little rain or a sharp frost, or when the wind
   blows from the cold corner of affliction.

   1 hear of some who, when they are very poor, do not come up to the
   House of God. They say they have not proper clothes to come in--as if
   the Lord had respect unto our garments which are nothing better than
   the covering of our shame! This is an idle excuse and yet I know that
   poverty does drive some professors away from the God whom they profess
   to worship--they murmur and become discouraged and give all up in a
   minute--as if they only loved God for the sake of bread, as a hungry
   dog will follow a stranger who feeds him. There are others who say, "I
   cannot hold up my head among my Brethren as I used to do and so I stay
   away from the congregation." As if God needed you to hold your heads
   up--as if He did not look most to those who hold down both their heads
   and their hearts!

   What? Will you turn away from the stream because you are thirsty? Will
   you leave the bread because you are hungry? Is not godliness meant to
   be a comfort to you in your time of trouble? Do not poor men need the
   Gospel? Do you not require it all the more, now that your comforts are
   so greatly diminished? Above all things, seek the Lord's face when
   trials surround you, or else, assuredly, you cannot be His own, for
   God's people, though they cry to Him daily, are yet driven to Him more
   and more in proportion as they are brought low and thrown into
   distress. "They cry unto the Lord

   in their trouble and He brings them out of their distresses." This is
   one of the sure marks of the children of God--they kiss the rod and,
   the more the Lord chastens them, the more they cling to Him.

   When the Lord smites, the ungodly kick against Him--they are like the
   bullock that will not plow by reason of stubbornness and when it feels
   a goad it kicks and will not go on, but is bent on having its own way.
   But when the Lord has trained His people and accustomed them to the
   yoke, they are obedient to the goad as soon as they feel it and yield
   to His will as soon as it is made known No, more than that--I think the
   more God chastens His people, the more they love Him!

   1 am persuaded that the most whipped of the Lord's family are the best
   of His children. I do not say that any of you may wish for
   affliction--you will have enough of it without wishing for it--but I do
   avow my belief that the favorites of Heaven are those who feel the most
   tribulation.

   The choicest plants in God's garden are those that are watered with
   affliction and made wet with the night dews of grief. His rarest vines
   are those which feel most of the knife and are cut back almost down to
   the root. There is no fragrance so sweet as that which distils from a
   flower which the great Farmer has bruised. And when He seems, even, to
   have trod upon it as though He despised it, He has been secretly
   blessing it, for the broken and the contrite heart He prizes above all
   things! Therefore, dear Friends, let all your griefs send you in prayer
   to God and you will then grow in blessing by every tribulation!

   When big waves of trouble come, pray that they may wash you on the Rock
   of Ages and they will do you no harm. When you lose anything, try to
   make a gain of it by going to your God, that He may sanctify the loss.
   Whenever you are afflicted, instead of running away from Him who smites
   you, run inwards to His bosom! If a man is very weak and he is
   contending with a strong adversary, he will do well to get close to
   him. The farther off, the heavier is the blow when a strong man deals
   it. But when the weak man closes in with him, how can the strong man
   smite him? What does God say? "Let him lay hold on My strength and I
   will make peace with him." Fly in spirit to your God! Fly to Him even
   when He seems angry! Run onto the point of His sword, for He will not
   harm the soul that confides in Him! It cannot be that humble trust
   should meet with a repulse. Jesus declares, "Him that comes to Me I
   will in no wise cast out." And if you will but trust Him and, when He
   seems angry, will still fly to Him, you shall find rest unto your
   souls. You children of God, mind this!

   Once more, notice that the Psalmist, while he thus looks to God and is
   driven to Him by his troubles, manifestly looks only to God. There is
   not, in this Psalm, a word about friends, allies, or helpers. He has
   but one request and this is, "Bow down Your ear, O Lord, hear me." His
   heart is evidently saying--

   "My spirit looks to God alone; My rock and refuge is His throne; In all
   my fears, in all my straits, My soul on His salvation waits." Only God!
   Oh, that is a word to be learned, to be learned by experience and most
   assuredly none will ever know it unless they are taught by the Holy
   Spirit! I do not think we often learn it till we hear it in the thunder
   of Divine power when the deep-throated tempest within the soul
   mutters--"Only God! God alone!" In fair weather we are for mixing our
   trust, but when the whirlwind is abroad, none but God will serve our
   turn. O my Brothers and Sisters, if you set one foot upon the rock of
   Divine faithfulness and the other foot upon the sand of human
   confidence, you will go down with a great fall! Both feet on the rock!
   Remember that!

   Your whole confidence must be fixed upon your Lord. Hang only upon that
   sure nail upon which hangs the whole universe and hang nowhere else.
   What does David say? "My Soul, wait only upon God, for my expectation
   is from Him." Beware of setting up a rival in the temple of your trust.
   Who is it that you would yoke with God? What helper is there that you
   would put side by side with Him? If you could depend upon an
   angel--does it not make you smile at your folly to think of saying, "I
   trust in God and an angel"? Why there is no pairing such disparities!
   The Infinite Creator of all is not to be yoked, even, with the most
   glorious of His creatures--and yet you would put your fellow man into
   the yoke with God and trust in these two!

   Go, yoke an angel with an ant if you will, but never think of joining
   God with man and making the two your confidence when God is All in All.
   Oh to be cut clear of all visible supports and props and holdfasts! You
   have seen a balloon well filled, struggling to rise--what kept it down?
   It longed to mount above the clouds into the calm serene and yet it
   lingered. What hindered it? The ropes which bound it to earth! Cut
   clear the ropes and then see how it mounts! With a

   spring it leaps upward while we are gazing into the open sky. O for
   such a clearance and such a mounting for our spirits! Alas, we are
   hindered and hampered! What are the bonds which detain us? Are they not
   our visible supports and reliances?

   my Soul, your human confidences have been to you like the iron chain
   which binds the captive eagle to the rock! If that confidence of yours
   were gone--if that chain on which you do dote so much were broken, even
   though it were with a rough blacksmith's hammer--then you could stretch
   your wings and be a child of the sun and dwell aloft amid the eternal
   light! Oftentimes the things which we most dread prove to be our grand
   necessity--by being deprived of earthly comforts we are cut clear of
   everything except our God! The Lord bring us into this state of high
   spiritual emancipation!

   With this as a preface, I now come to notice the particular prayer
   which David, in this state of mind, puts up. It was necessary to give
   you this preface as a kind of guard against the very common tendency
   which exists among God's people to depend upon signs and tokens.
   Especially as we are going to preach a little upon this prayer for a
   "token," it was essential to begin aright lest we should add to the too
   common craving for signs and wonders.

   We will dwell, first, upon the request for a token and then, if we have
   time, we will touch upon the result which David says would come of
   having such a token--that those which hated him would see it and be
   ashamed because God had helped him and comforted him.

   I. David puts up A REQUEST FOR A TOKEN. It was a token from God, mark
   you, and it was a token entirely according to God's will. Never forget
   that it was a token asked in faith and not in unbelief, for there is a
   great distinction here. Dear Brothers and Sisters, we have no right to
   say, "My God, I will believe in You if You will give me a token and, if
   not, I will remain in hesitating unbelief," for the English of that is,
   "I will reckon You to be false unless You show me a sign according to
   my will." If God is true, you are bound to believe Him, whether He give
   you a token or not! And you are not permitted to suspend your faith
   upon conditions of your own inventing. Whether He will or will not give
   you a token must be according to His own mind.

   He may give or withhold as He pleases, but you are bound to believe Him
   since every man is bound to believe the Truth of God. God has never
   been false to you! You have, therefore, no cause to doubt Him. If He
   gives you the light, be thankful, but as His child you are bound to
   trust Him in the dark. If He speaks to you a favorable word, you are to
   be glad, but you are bound to trust Him even if He speaks nothing but
   rough words to you, for He is just as true. His Truth and your belief
   in that Truth must not be thought to depend upon signs and tokens--His
   Word is very sure and may not be questioned. Moreover, we have known
   some who professed to be the children of God who have picked out
   certain tokens according to their own whims and fancies and follies and
   they have spoken as if God must do this or that at their dictation.

   1 fear that in some this is a wicked presumption not to be tolerated
   for a moment. At best it is a childish folly which men in Christ Jesus
   ought, long ago, to have outgrown. I do not doubt that the Lord has
   indulged some of His little children with wonders and signs while they
   were very, very feeble, which He will never give them again and which
   they ought never to seek again--which, indeed, now that they have grown
   up to riper years and to more strength of Grace, they ought,
   themselves, to put away as childish things. Not a few of these signs
   they may even suspect, saying, "Perhaps, after all, there was not so
   much in those signs and tokens as I thought there was. They helped me
   just then, but I could not rely upon them now--I prefer that which is
   better and surer."

   The Apostle Peter, after he has described Christ upon the mount as
   manifesting Himself to His servants in the Transfiguration, declares,
   "We have a more sure word of prophecy." What? More sure than the
   Transfiguration? Yes, more sure, even, than the evidence of their eyes
   when they saw their Lord glorified upon the holy mountain! If you have
   ever been upon the mountain with Christ and if you have seen all His
   brightness, you are still not to compare, even, the sight of your eyes
   when they see the best and brightest that they can see, with the Word
   of Testimony which must be sure--a light that shines in a dark place!
   All the heavenly experiences which we have ever had are not to be
   trusted in comparison with the Word of God in the Bible!

   I say it advisedly--even the sweetest communion we have ever had with
   Christ may, after all, be suspect and, indeed, it is upon such ripe
   fruit that Satan soon sets his hand that he may rob us of its savor, if
   possible, for he is not slow to cast doubts upon the holiest joys of
   God's elect. There may come a time when we shall fear that we were
   carried away by excitement, or deluded by fanaticism, but He who speaks
   the Word of Scripture cannot lie! And when His Spirit speaks that

   same Truth of God into the soul, we have, therein, a testimony which
   can never be doubted but must be accepted over the head of everything.
   "Let God be true and every man a liar"--ourselves and all--all liars as
   compared with the eternal Truths of the Revelation of God the Holy
   Spirit! The basis of faith is not our experience, but the Testimony of
   God and we must mind we do not make the feet of our image partly of
   God's gold and partly of our clay. Our experience may be in error, but
   the Infallible Word of God cannot be and it is upon that, alone, which
   we must stand.

   Yet we may ask for tokens in a subordinate sense. Trusting in the Lord,
   token or no token--believing His Word, evidence or no evidence--we may,
   then, humbly ask confirmatory seals to our souls. Taking His promise as
   it stands and believing it, though the heavens, themselves, should seem
   to rock and reel--we may then say, "Yet Lord, inasmuch as I am but dust
   and ashes and, therefore, weak and trembling, show me a token for
   good." We may feel quite safe in seeking tokens of the kind which are
   mentioned in this Psalm. And first, we may beg for answers to prayer,
   because the Psalm begins with, "Bow down Your ear, O Lord, hear me" and
   farther on we read in the sixth verse, "Give ear, O Lord, unto my
   prayer and attend to the voice of my supplications."

   There is no fanaticism in expecting God to answer prayer and there is
   no misuse of logic in drawing the inference that if He does hear my
   prayer in the time of trouble, this is a token for good to my soul. Has
   my prayer been accepted before Him? Have I received the gracious answer
   of peace? Then let me be comforted! Was I especially in deep distress
   where no man could help me and did I cry to Him and did He come to my
   rescue? Assuredly, this is a seal that is set to my soul that I am no
   hypocrite! This is a token that I am no stranger to God and that I am
   not cast away from His Presence! Answered prayers are hopeful arguments
   of acceptance. David fitly said, "If I regard iniquity in my heart, the
   Lord will not hear me," and then he joyfully added, "But verily God has
   heard me." Thus he proved the soundness of his heart before God!

   I ask you to look back and see whether you have, indeed, prevailed with
   God in secret prayer. Have you had your Jabboks and your Carmels? Do I
   not speak to many who are familiar with the great Hearer of prayer? Has
   He not often heard you? I am not too bold when I assert that the Lord
   has granted me, according to the desire of my heart, times without
   number! The devil himself can never dispute me out of facts--facts
   which shall forever stand on my memory, "engraved as in eternal brass,"
   for out of the depths I have cried unto God and He has as distinctly
   answered my prayers as though He had torn the heavens and come down to
   succor His servant! With overwhelming delight He fills me, for He has
   had respect unto my cry. His tenderness to me in this respect has made
   my life singularly happy though I have had a large share of pain and
   depression.

   When I think over the seasons in which the Lord has specially answered
   me, I bid defiance to all the skeptics and scientists who haunt our
   footsteps. Brethren in Christ, you have, each of you, in your own way,
   according to your own need, had sure instances of the faithfulness of
   God to you and these have been reviving tokens of love! At this present
   be of good cheer. Even if, for a while, the heavens should seem as
   brass and prayer should not be heard, remember that He did hear you in
   times gone by and He is the same God and changes not and, therefore, is
   hearing, still, and will answer, by-and-by. Therefore cry mightily to
   Him!

   It may be that your prayer is like a ship, which, when it goes on a
   very long voyage, does not come home laden so soon but, when it does
   come home, it has a richer freight. Mere coasters will bring you coals,
   or such like ordinary things. But they that go afar to Tarshish return
   with gold and ivory! Coasting prayers such as we pray every day bring
   us many necessities, but there are great prayers which, like the old
   Spanish galleons, cross the main ocean and are longer out of sight--but
   come home laden with golden freight! When prayer has tarried, the Lord
   our God has made up for the delays and shown us why He delayed--to give
   us a richer and a rarer blessing through our waiting and also to
   prepare us to receive it. Go on in prayer if you have no immediate
   answer and let the answers you have had in years gone by be tokens for
   good to your soul at this time--

   "God lives still!

   Trust, my Soul, and fear no ill. God is good. From His compassion
   Earthly help and comfort flow! Strong is His right hand to fashion All
   things well for men below. Trials often the most distressing,

   In the end have proved a blessing. Why then, my Soul, despair.9 God
   still lives and hears prayer."

   You meet with another class of tokens in the Psalm and these concern
   the preservation of character. Kindly read the second verse--"Preserve
   my soul, for I am holy." I know I am speaking in these dark and
   troubled times to many of God's children who are tried in business and
   sorely exercised by the general depression--your great fear arises out
   of a dread of failure to discharge your debts. You have been praying to
   the Lord about your business and, perhaps, Satan has tempted you to a
   measure of unbelief against which you are daily fighting. Now, has the
   Lord helped you to do that which is honest and upright before men? Has
   He preserved your soul because you are consecrated to Him?

   You have been a loser, but in that loss can you say, "No fault attaches
   to deceit--it is the act of God. Things have not prospered with me, but
   I have been diligent and I have used my best discretion. I have
   curtailed every expense to save as much as possible. I have sought to
   eat my own bread and not the bread of another man and I would sooner
   come to labor with my hands in the most menial service than that any
   should say of me that I have forgotten the way of uprightness and
   integrity." If such is the case, you will feel acutely the difficulties
   of your path, but you must not give way to despondency. Look up and
   play the man and by no means give up!

   Fly to the Lord in this hour of need and see what He will do. It is
   written, "Let integrity and uprightness preserve me," and if such has
   been your case it is a token for good. You have not lost much if your
   character remains untarnished. After all, "a man's life consists not in
   the abundance of the things which he possesses." And, "a good name is
   better than precious ointment." When God gives a man Grace to rejoice
   in his abundance, it is a great thing. But it is an equal favor when He
   gives to others of His people Grace to rejoice that they are brought
   low. There is often more contentment in a narrower sphere than in a
   wider one and a great deal less care and anxiety and more fellowship
   with God in a cottage than in a broad mansion!

   If God keeps your character spotless, reckon that the smell of fire has
   not passed upon you. If the Lord enables you to do the right thing, let
   Him do what He pleases with you. If we can pay 20 shillings in the
   pound and walk out of the house free from any charge of unjust dealing,
   we may feel that the worst grief of all is over, for to an honest heart
   it is a crushing trial to be unable to pay every man his own. May the
   Holy Spirit lead you in the path of uprightness and you need not envy
   any among the sons of men.

   A third form of token for good is found in deliverance from trouble. We
   have that in the second verse also--"O You, my God, save Your servant
   that trusts in You!" And all through the Psalm David is crying for
   deliverance from trouble. I am addressing many who have felt the
   strokes of tribulation. You have been brought very low. In your horror
   it seemed to you like the lowest Hell, but you have been brought up
   from it and you can, at this hour, sing of delivering Grace. We are not
   all hanging our harps on the willows--some of us are praising God upon
   the high sounding cymbals because of His delivering mercy, for He has
   brought our soul out of prison, has delivered our soul from death, our
   eyes from tears and our feet from falling.

   When these things come, they are to be regarded as tokens for good if
   they come as the result of prayer and faith. Our personal testimony
   should be like that of David in the 34th Psalm--"I sought the Lord and
   He heard me and delivered me from all my fears. They looked unto Him
   and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed. This poor man
   cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles."
   When our distresses are ended, our songs should begin, even as the
   Psalmist says of men rescued from peril--they pray and then they
   praise. "Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and He brings
   them out of their distresses. Oh that men would praise the Lord for His
   goodness and for His wonderful works to the children of men!"

   There ought to be praises where there have been deliverances. When we
   have gone to God in prayer with open mouth and He has filled it, then
   should we go back again with the open mouth, to have it filled with His
   praises all the day long! Come, Friends, look back upon the rescues and
   recoveries of the past and rejoice in the Lord! One good old saint,
   when she heard one sing--

   "Each sweetEbenezer I ha ve in review,

   Confirms His good pleasure to help me quite through,"

   said, "Why, my road, when I look back upon it, is paved with Ebenezers!
   I cannot take a step but what I step upon a stone of help and on both
   sides I see so many records of the Lord's goodness that the road seems
   walled up by them on both sides." Many of us can say the same. Surely--

   "His love in time past forbids us to think, He'll leave us, at last, in
   trouble to sink."

   If He has delivered us from the jaw of the lion and the paw of the
   bear, shall we be afraid of that uncircumcised Philistine? No, but the
   giant boaster shall fall before us! In the name of the Lord we will
   destroy all future foes because in His name we have destroyed the same
   before. That is fine language which Paul uses in the Epistle to the
   Corinthians--"Who delivered us from so great a death and does deliver:
   in whom we trust that He will yet deliver us." These three forms of
   tokens for good are very sure and very sober--not at all like those
   which fanaticism seeks after and yet they are most valuable! Answered
   prayers, preservations from sin and deliverances from trouble are rich
   jewels from the Bridegroom's hands--marks of His most costly love.
   Those who have them should not forget them. "Shall a maid forget her
   ornaments?" Shall gifts of the Bridegroom be put away as though they
   were of no value? God forbid!

   There is another form of token which must never be overlooked and that
   is a sense of pardoned sin. This comes in the third and fifth verses.
   "Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto You daily. For You, Lord,
   are good and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them
   that call upon You." Even though we have been sustained in our
   integrity, we must, nevertheless, be conscious of many faults. You
   cannot go through either the joys of this world or the sorrows of it
   without incurring a measure of defilement. He who picks his steps the
   most successfully will yet gather soil upon his feet and they will need
   washing by those dear hands which, alone, can take away the stain of
   sin! When that washing is given, it is a very choice token of love.

   If you feel that your conscience is purged from dead works--if you are
   walking in the light as God is in the light and are enjoying fellowship
   with the Father while the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses you
   from all sin, then rejoice in the token for good which is given you! If
   you know the power of that Word of God, "There is, therefore, now, no
   condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus"--if you are, indeed,
   "accepted in the Beloved"--then know of a surety that one of the best
   tokens for good is in your possession! It may be that your purse is
   scant, but your sin is forgiven! It may be that disease is creeping
   over your flesh, but your sin is forgiven! What a bliss is yours,
   whatever your trial may be!

   Suppose yourself to be in danger of shipwreck--the ship is going
   down--the passengers are shrieking with terror, for there is nothing
   before them but the murderous waves. The boiling floods will soon
   conceal the last vestige of the ship. Grim Death opens his wide jaws!
   The last moment has come! But what do I see? What was that which rose
   upon the crest of the wave? It was a lifeboat! Yes! Here comes a
   lifeboat and you are put on board! What are your thoughts at the time?
   What must be your thoughts? What? Did you whine, "I have lost my best
   suitcase which I left in my cabin"? What a fool you would be if you
   talked like that! The boatmen would be ready to throw you back into the
   sea!

   No, your gratitude forgets all minor things and rejoices in the grand
   deliverance. You cry, "My life is saved! My life is saved! Blessed be
   the Lord for saving me! My money, my very clothes--for I started up in
   my sleep and leaped into the lifeboat--I have lost them all, but I am
   alive and that is enough! Thank God I shall see my native land again!"
   Shall a man who is delivered from Hell and whose sins are forgiven go
   whining all the day long because he has lost his money, or some other
   trifle--for trifle it is as compared with his soul? "Skin for skin,
   yes, all that a man has will he give for his life." And if our life is
   saved in Christ Jesus through the forgiveness of our sin by His most
   precious blood, how can we

   fret?

   Why, Man, God has given you a mercy that may swallow up your troubles
   as Aaron's rod swallowed up all the serpents. "Strike me, my God," said
   one of old, "strike me as You will, now that You have forgiven me!" The
   pardon of sin is such a token for good that all ills disappear before
   it! There is another token for good mentioned in the Psalm which you
   may well pray for. You will find it in the fourth verse--"Rejoice the
   soul of Your servant: for unto You, O Lord, do I lift up my soul." This
   is support under trial. It is a very blessed token for good when you
   are able to keep calm, quiet and happy in the midst of losses, crosses,
   bereavements and afflictions. All the water in the sea will never hurt
   the ship so long as it is outside--it is only that which enters the
   vessel that can sink it. And therefore the Savior says, "Let not your
   heart be troubled; you believe in God; believe also in Me." In the
   world you shall have tribulation, but let not your heart be troubled.

   Now, are you, dear Friend, conscious, at this time, while everything is
   going against you, that you never were happier than you are now? Can
   you give all up? Can you be resigned to your heavenly Father's will?
   Does a sweet patience steal over you? Do you sometimes say to yourself
   and to your friends, "I would not have believed that I could have
   passed through this as I am doing"? Well, that is a token for good and
   you may take comfort from it. What does it matter to a man, after all,
   whether God increases the load and increases the strength, or whether
   He decreases the load and decreases the strength? If a man has to carry
   a pound weight and he is so weak that he can only manage to carry eight
   ounces, well, he is an overloaded man. But if a man had to carry a ton
   and God gave him strength enough to carry two, why, he would be a
   lightly-loaded man, would he not? It is not the weight of the burden,
   Brothers and Sisters, it is the proportion of the burden to the
   strength.

   Now, the proportion of the burden to the strength was settled long
   ago--thousands of years ago. It is written, "As your days, so shall
   your strength be" and there was One who proved it 1,800 years ago and
   exclaimed, "As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our
   consolation also abounds by Christ." You see the scale--if there is an
   ounce of suffering, there is an ounce of consolation. Almighty Wisdom
   keeps the measure exact! Let the tribulation abound! Put it into the
   left-hand scale. Heap it up! Put in more and more trial. What a weight
   it is! Yes, but there you see in the right-hand scale the balancing
   consolation--and I think if we were wise, we would be willing to
   accept--no, we would even rejoice in the abounding tribulations because
   of the abounding consolations!

   We shall always be little, I am afraid, while our trials are little.
   But when we get into the deeper waters, so that the Lord helps us to
   swim and He makes men of us--then we begin to glory in tribulation
   because the power of God does rest upon us! Oh may the Lord give us
   faith to come up to this point and this shall be forever a blessed
   token for good when we can say--

   "I stand upon the mount of God, With sunlight in my soul!

   I hear the storms in vales beneath,

   I hear the thunders roll

   But I am calm with You, my God,

   Beneath these glorious skies

   And to the heights on which I stand,

   Nor storms nor clouds can rise." May God endow us with that token for
   good--for serenity in suffering, patience in tribulation, joy in the
   very prospect of death--these are all as white stones which are the
   secret signs of Divine favor.

   Cheering visits from Christ and fresh anointing of the Holy Spirit are
   also most sure tokens for good and if not mentioned expressly in the
   Psalm, must not be omitted in our sermon. They are, however, here in
   such phrases as these-- "Rejoice the soul of Your servant," in verse
   four. "Unite my heart to fear Your name," in verse eleven. "O turn unto
   me and have mercy upon me," in verse 16 and in the latter clause of our
   text, "You, Lord, have helped me and comforted me." The Lord graciously
   visits His people, the clouds break, the night declines and the day
   begins to dawn! Precious promises are applied to the heart with
   reviving power, hope is strengthened and joy is renewed.

   Sweet communion is enjoyed under affliction and Christ is seen sitting
   as a Refiner at the mouth of the furnace. Sin is no longer allowed to
   burden the heart. Yes, the very memory of it, so far as it would cause
   pain to the mind, is utterly removed and the glad spirit rejoices in
   the consciousness of full acceptance with God. Ordinances and the Word
   become sweeter than honey or the honeycomb and the man feasts in the
   House of the Lord as one who is an honored guest at a royal banquet
   where the banner of Jesus' love waves over his head and he leans his
   head on his Lord's bosom! This is a token for good, the memory of which
   shall cheer him for many a long day and, being treasured up like some
   sweet smelling herb, shall serve to make his sick chamber or prison
   fragrant.

   O the joy of saints when the Bridegroom is with them! They cannot fast
   or be of a sad countenance, for their assurance of His Divine Love
   drives every care and fear away--

   "'Tis like the singing of the birds

   When winter's frost is fled!

   And like the warmth the sun affords

   To creatures almost dead.

   'Tis like the comfort of a calm Which stills a stormy sea And like the
   tender, healing balm To such as wounded be." Of such tokens for good
   may we enjoy until the day breaks and the shadows flee away.

   II. I had many things to say, but I remember Paul's mistake that he
   made when he preached until midnight and Eutychus fell from the third
   loft, for he had gone to sleep. And as I could not possibly raise a
   sleeper from the dead, as Paul did, I will not try the experiment of
   preaching as long as Paul did! I cannot say anything as to THE RESULT
   OF SUCH TOKENS. The influence of these tokens upon our foes must be
   undescribed except that many a time the favor of God to His people has
   been so conspicuous that their most malicious adversaries have stood in
   awe of them. Their answered prayers have been like armor to them! Their
   patience has lit up their faces with an awe-inspiring splendor and
   their integrity has been a wall of fire round about them.

   Even the devil has stood abashed in the presence of the favored ones
   when God has dressed them in their marriage robes! He has known that
   they were of that chosen race against which he can never prevail. As
   for other enemies-- "When a man's ways please the Lord, He makes even
   his enemies to be at peace with Him." Like Pilate's wife, even worldly
   people have pleaded that good men should be left alone--the Lord has
   made them dream of the glory of their virtue and they have been afraid.
   There is a dignity which hedges about those who are kings unto God.
   They that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth are afraid because
   of the tokens for good which God sets on His saints.

   Here we leave these words, only adding this--what an unhappy state must
   those be in who have troubles but have no God to go to! Those who have
   enemies, but no heavenly Defender--darkness and no Star of hope! How
   poor must you be who cannot escape affliction and yet have no Helper in
   affliction! You run to your friends, do you? Ah well, they are a poor
   refuge to fly to, for mostly they are our friends when we can help
   them. When we need anything from them, they do not know us! You trust
   yourself, do you? Ah well, I thought little of your friends, but I
   think less of you, for you are dust and ashes and nothing else--and if
   your trust is in yourself, it is a dream! And so you are a self-made
   man! Your own creator? You need not be so very proud of your work! As
   you made yourself and keep yourself going, you will come to a frightful
   end, one of these days, when the inward force decays into weakness and
   all the springs of Nature fail!

   Whatever you make, your god is like yourself and both you and it must
   pass away before long! Your hope shall be as a spider's web and your
   expectation shall melt like the frost when the sun rises. The Lord is
   coming! The Lord is coming and woe unto hypocrites in that day! It will
   go ill with self-confident men in that day! But as for such as trust
   the Lord, do you know what they say? And they speak as Inspiration bids
   them speak--"I shall be satisfied." I am not yet, but I shall be
   satisfied. And when shall I be satisfied? "When I awake with Your
   likeness." When the archangel's trumpet sounds and wakes me into
   immortal perfection, then shall I be satisfied!

   Oh seek the Savior's face! dear Hearts, that never have sought Him yet,
   seek Him now! There is no satisfaction to be had apart from Him! Get
   away to Him! Get away to Him tonight! Cry unto Him, for He will hear
   you! Come unto Him, for He will receive you! May His Divine Spirit lead
   you to cast yourselves on Him, for He will in no wise cast you out! The
   Lord bless you, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

The Plain Man's Pathway To Peace

   (No. 1560)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE NEWINGTON.

   "And when Jesus departed from there, two blind men followed Him, crying
   and saying, You son of Da vid, have mercy on us! And when He was come
   into the house, the blind men came to Him: and Jesus said unto them, Do
   you believe that I am able to do this? They said unto Him, Yes, Lord.
   Then He touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto
   you. And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them,
   saying, See that no one knows it." Matthew 9:27-30.

   I AM not about to expound this incident, nor to draw illustrations from
   it, but only to direct your attention to one single point in it and
   that is, its extreme simplicity. There are other cases of blind men and
   we have various incidents connected with them, such as, in one
   instance, the making of clay and the sending of the patient to wash at
   the pool of Siloam and so forth. But here the cure is extremely
   simple--the men are blind, they cry to Jesus, they come near, they
   confess their faith and they receive their sight straightway! In many
   other cases of miracles that were worked by Christ there were
   circumstances of difficulty. In one case a man is let down through the
   roof, being borne of four; in a second case a woman comes behind Him in
   the press and touches the hem of His garment with great effort.

   We read of another who had been dead four days and there seemed to be a
   clear impossibility in the way of his ever coming forth from the tomb.
   But everything is plain sailing here. Here are blind men, conscious of
   their blindness, confident that Christ can give them sight. They cry to
   Him, they come to Him, they believe that He is able to open their eyes
   and they receive their sight at once! You see there was, in their case,
   these simple elements--a sense of blindness, a desire for sight--then
   prayer, then coming to Christ, then an open avowal of faith and then
   the cure. The whole matter lies in a nutshell. There are no details, no
   points of care and nicety which might suggest anxiety--the whole
   business is simplicity, itself, and upon that one point I want to dwell
   at this time.

   There are cases of conversion which are just as simple as this case of
   the opening of the eyes of the blind and we are not to doubt the
   reality of the work of Grace in them because of the remarkable absence
   of amazing incidents and striking details. We are not to suppose that a
   conversion is a less genuine work of the Holy Spirit because it is
   extremely simple. May the Holy Spirit bless our meditation.

   I. To make our discourse useful to many I will begin by remarking, in
   the first place, that it is an undoubted fact that MANY PERSONS ARE
   MUCH TROUBLED IN COMING TO CHRIST. It is a fact which must be
   admitted--that all do not come quite so readily as these blind men
   came. There are instances on record in biographies--there are many
   known to us and, perhaps, our own cases are among them--in which coming
   to Christ was a matter of struggle, of effort, of disappointment, of
   long waiting and, at last, of a kind of desperation by which we were
   forced to come.

   You must have read Mr. John Bunyan's description of how the pilgrims
   came to the wicket gate. They were pointed, you remember, by Evangelist
   to a light and to a gate and they went that way according to his
   bidding. I have told you, sometimes, the story of a young man in
   Edinburgh who was very anxious to speak to others about their souls, so
   he addressed himself one morning to an old Musselburgh fishwife and he
   began by saying to her, "Here you are with your burden." "Yes," she
   said. He asked her, "Did you ever feel a spiritual burden?" "Yes," she
   said, resting a bit, "I felt the spiritual burden years ago, before you
   were born, and I got rid of it, too. But I did not go the same way to
   work that Bunyan's pilgrim did."

   Our young friend was greatly surprised to hear her say that and thought
   she must be under grievous error and therefore begged her to explain.
   "No," she said, "when I was under concern of soul, I heard a true
   Gospel minister who bade

   me look to the Cross of Christ and there I lost my load of sin. I did
   not hear one of those milk-and-water preachers like Bunyan's
   Evangelist." "How," said our young friend, "do you make that out?"
   "Why, that Evangelist, when he met the man with the burden on his back,
   said to him, 'Do you see that wicket gate?' 'No,' he said, 'I don't.'
   'Do you see that light?' 'I think I do.' Why, man," she said, "he
   should not have spoken about wicket gates or lights, but he should have
   said, 'Do you see Jesus Christ hanging on the Cross? Look to Him and
   your burden will fall off your shoulders.'

   "He sent that man round the wrong way when he sent him to the wicket
   gate and much good he got by it, for he was likely to have been choked
   in the Slough of Despond before long! I tell you, I looked at once to
   the Cross and away went my burden." "What?" said this young man, "Did
   you never go through the Slough of Despond?" "Ah," said she, "many a
   time, more than I care to tell. But at the first I heard the preacher
   say, 'Look to Christ,' and I looked to Him. I have been through the
   Slough of Despond since that--but let me tell you, Sir, it is much
   easier to go through that slough with your burden off than it is with
   your burden on!"

   And so it is! Blessed are they whose eyes are only and altogether on
   the Crucified! The older I grow the more sure I am of this, that we
   must have done with self in all forms and see Jesus, only, if we would
   be at peace. Was John Bunyan wrong? Certainly not! He was describing
   things as they generally are. Was the old woman wrong? No! She was
   perfectly right--she was describing things as they ought to be and as I
   wish they always were. Still, experience is not always as it ought to
   be and much of the experience of Christians is not Christian
   experience! It is a fact which I lament, but, nevertheless, must admit,
   that a large number of persons, before they come to the Cross and lose
   their burden, go round about no end of a way, trying this plan and that
   plan with but very slender success, after all, instead of coming
   straightway to Christ just as they are, looking to Him and finding
   light and life at once.

   How is it, then, that some are so long in getting to Christ? I answer,
   first, in some cases it is ignorance. Perhaps there is no subject upon
   which men are so ignorant as the Gospel. Is it not preached in hundreds
   of places? Yes, thank God, it is, and illustrated in no end of books.
   But still men come not at it so--neither hearing nor reading can, of
   themselves, discover the Gospel. It needs the teaching of the Holy
   Spirit, or else men still remain in ignorance as to this simplicity--
   this simplicity of salvation by faith! Men are in the dark and do not
   know the way and so they run here and there and oftentimes go round
   about to find a Savior who is ready, then and there, to bless them!

   They cry, "Oh that I knew where I might find Him!" when, if they did
   but understand the Truth of God, His salvation is near them, "in their
   mouth and in their heart." If with their heart they will believe on the
   Lord Jesus and with their mouth make confession of Him, they shall be
   saved then and there! In many cases, too, men are hindered by
   prejudice. People are brought up with the belief that salvation must be
   through ceremonies and if they get driven out of that, they still
   conclude that it must certainly be in some measure by their works.
   Numbers of people have learned a sort of half-and-half Gospel, part Law
   and part Grace, and they are in a thick fog about salvation.

   They know that redemption has something to do with Christ, but it is
   much of a mixture with them--they do not quite see that it is all
   Christ or no Christ! They have a notion that we are saved by Grace, but
   they do not yet see that salvation must be of Grace from top to bottom.
   They fail to see that in order that salvation may be of Grace it must
   be received by faith and not through the works of the Law, nor by
   priestcraft, nor by any rites and ceremonies whatever. Being brought up
   to believe that surely there is something for them to do, it is long
   before they can get into the clear, blessed sunlight of the Word of God
   where the child of God sees Christ and finds liberty.

   "Believe and live" is a foreign language to a soul which is persuaded
   that its own works are, in a measure, to win eternal life. With many,
   indeed, the hindrance lies in downright bad teaching. The teaching that
   is so common, nowadays, is very dangerous. The service makes no
   distinction between saint and sinner. Certain prayers are used every
   day which are meant for saints and sinners, too--ready-made
   clothes--made to fit everybody and fitting nobody at all. These prayers
   suit neither saint nor sinner, thoroughly beautiful as they are and
   grand as they are--they bring people up under the notion and delusion
   that they are somewhere in a condition between being saved and being
   lost--not actually lost, certainly, but yet not quite saints--they are
   betweenites, mongrels!

   They are a sort of Samaritan that fears the Lord and serves other gods
   and who hopes to be saved by a mixture of Grace and works. It is hard
   to bring men to Grace, alone, and faith, alone--they will stand with
   one foot on the sea and the other foot on the land. Much of teaching
   goes to buoy them up in the notion that there is something in man and
   something to be done by him and, therefore, they do not learn in their
   own souls that they must be saved by Christ and

   not by themselves. Besides that, there is the natural pride of the
   human heart. We do not like to be saved by charity. We must have a
   finger in it! We get pushed into a corner--we are driven farther and
   farther away from self-confidence, but we hang on by our teeth if we
   cannot find a hold by any other means!

   With awful desperation we trust in ourselves. We will cling by our
   eyelashes to the semblance of self-confidence! We will not give up
   carnal confidence if it is possible to hold it. Then comes in, with our
   pride, opposition to God, for the human heart does not love God and it
   frequently shows its opposition by opposing Him about the plan of
   salvation. The enmity of the unrenewed heart is not displayed by actual
   open sin in all cases, for many, by their very growing up, have been
   made to be moral--but they hate God's plan of Grace and Grace,
   alone--and here their gall and bitterness begin to work. How they will
   writhe in their seats if the minister preaches Divine Sovereignty! They
   hate the text, "He will have mercy on whom He will have mercy and He
   will have compassion on whom He will have compassion."

   They talk of the rights of fallen men and of all being treated
   equally--and when it comes to Sovereignty and God's manifesting His
   Grace according to His own absolute will--they cannot endure it! If
   they tolerate God at all, it shall not be on the Throne. If they
   acknowledge His existence, yet not as King of kings and Lord of lords
   who does as He wills and has a right to pardon whom He reserves and to
   leave the guilty, if it so pleases Him, to perish in their guiltiness,
   rejecting the Savior. Ah, the heart loves not God as God, as revealed
   in Scripture, but makes a god unto itself and cries, "These are your
   gods, O Israel."

   In some instances the struggle of the heart in getting to Christ, I
   have no doubt, arises from a singularity of mental conformation and
   such cases ought to be looked upon as exceptions and by no means
   regarded as rules. Now take, for instance, the case of John Bunyan, to
   which we have referred. If you read, "Grace Abounding," you will find
   that, for five years or more, he was the subject of the most fearful
   despair--tempted by Satan, tempted by his own self--always raising
   difficulties against himself. And it was long, long, long before he
   could come to the Cross and find peace. But then, dear Friends, it is
   to the last degree improbable that either you or I will ever turn out
   to be John Bunyans. We may become tinkers, but we shall never write a
   Pilgrim's Progress! We might imitate him in his poverty, but we are not
   likely to emulate him in his genius.

   A man with such an imagination, full of wondrous dreams, is not born
   every day and when he does come along, his inheritance of brain is not
   all a gain in the direction of a restful life. When Bunyan's
   imagination had been purified and sanctified, its masterly productions
   were seen in his marvelous allegories! But while, as yet, he had not
   been renewed and reconciled to God--with such a mind so strangely
   formed, so devoid of all education and brought up, as he had been, in
   the roughest society--he was dowered with a fearful heritage. That
   marvelous fancy would have worked him wondrous woe if it had not been
   controlled by the Divine Spirit! Do you wonder that, in coming to the
   day, those eyes which had been veiled in such dense darkness could
   scarcely bear the light and that the man should think the darkness all
   the darker when the light began to shine upon him? Bunyan was one by
   himself--not the rule, but the exception.

   Now, you, dear Friend, may be an odd person. Very likely you are and I
   can sympathize with you, for I am odd enough, myself. But do not lay
   down a law that everybody else must be odd, too. If you and I did
   happen to go round by the back ways, do not let us think that everybody
   ought to follow our bad example. Let us be very thankful that some
   people's minds are less twisted and gnarled than ours and do not let us
   set up our experience as a standard for other people. No doubt
   difficulties may arise from an extraordinary quality of mind with which
   God may have gifted some, or a depression of spirit natural to
   others--and these may make them peculiar as long as they live.

   Besides, there are some who are kept from coming to Christ through
   remarkable assaults of Satan. You remember the story of the child whom
   his father would bring to Jesus, but, "as he was a coming, the devil
   threw him down and tore him"? The evil spirit knew that his time was
   short and he must soon be expelled from his victim and, therefore, he
   cast him on the ground and made him wallow in epilepsy and left him
   half dead. So does Satan with many men. He sets upon them with all the
   brutality of his fiendish nature and expends his malice upon them
   because he fears that they are about to escape from his service and he
   will no longer be able to tyrannize over them. As Watts says--

   "He worries whom He can't devour, With a malicious joy."

   Now, if some come to Christ and the devil is not permitted to assail
   them; if some come to Christ and there is nothing strange about their
   experience; if some come to Christ and pride and opposition have been
   conquered in their nature; if some come to Christ and they are not
   ignorant but well instructed and readily see the light, let us rejoice
   that it is so! It is of such that I am now about to speak somewhat more
   at length.

   II. It is admitted as an undoubted fact that many are much troubled in
   coming to Christ but now, secondly, THIS IS

   NOT AT ALL ESSENTIAL TO A REAL SAVING COMING TO THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.
   I mention this because I

   have known Christian men distressed in heart because they fear that
   they came to Christ too easily. They have half imagined, as they looked
   back, that they could not have been converted at all because their
   conversion was not attended with such agony and torment of mind as
   others speak of.

   I would first remark that it is very difficult to see how despairing
   feelings can be essential to salvation! Look for a minute. Can it be
   possible that unbelief can help a soul to faith? Is it not certain that
   the anguish which many experience before they come to Christ arises
   from the fact of their unbelief? They do not trust--they say they
   cannot trust--and so they are like the troubled sea which cannot rest.
   Their mind is tossed to and fro and vexed sorely through unbelief. Is
   this a foundation for holy trust? It would seem to me the oddest thing
   in all the world that unbelief should be a preparation for faith! How
   can it be that to sow the ground with thistle seed should make it more
   ready for the good corn? Are fire and sword helpers to national
   prosperity? Is deadly poison an assistance to health?

   I do not understand it. It seems to me to be far better for the soul to
   believe the Word of God at once and far more likely to be a genuine
   work when the soul, convicted of sin, accepts the Savior. Here is God's
   way of salvation and He demands that I trust His dear Son who died for
   sinners. I perceive that Christ is worthy to be trusted, for He is the
   Son of God--so that His sacrifice must be able to put away my sin. I
   perceive, also, that He laid down His life in the place of His people
   and, therefore, I heartily trust Him. God bids me trust Him and I trust
   Him without any further question. If Jesus Christ satisfies God, He
   certainly satisfies me! And, asking no further question, I come and
   trust myself with Him.

   Does not this kind of action appear to have about it all that can be
   necessary? Can it possibly be that a raging, raving despair can ever be
   helpful towards saving faith? I do not see it. I cannot think it! Some
   have been beaten about with most awful thoughts. They have supposed
   that God could not possibly forgive them--they have imagined that, even
   if He could pardon them He would not since they were not His elect, nor
   His redeemed! Though they have seen the Gospel invitation written in
   letters of love--"Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden,
   and I will give you rest," they dare to question whether they should
   find rest if they came and they invent suspicions and surmises, some of
   them amounting, even, to blasphemy against the Character of God and the
   Person of His Christ!

   That such people have been forgiven according to the riches of Divine
   Grace I do verily believe, but that their sinful thoughts ever helped
   them to obtain pardon I cannot imagine! That my own dark thoughts of
   God, which left many a scar upon my spirit, were washed away with all
   my other sins, I know. And that there was never any good in those
   things, or that I can look back upon them without shame and regret is
   also a thing I know! I cannot see of what particular service they could
   have been to anybody! Shall one bath of ink take out the stain of
   another? Can our sin be removed by our sinning more? It is impossible
   that sin could aid Grace and that the greatest of all sins, the sin of
   unbelief, should help towards faith!

   Yet, once again, dear Friends, much of all this struggling and tumult
   within which some have experienced is the work of the devil, as I have
   already said. Can it be essential to salvation for a man to be under
   the influence of Satan? Is it necessary that the devil should come in
   to help Christ? Is it absolutely essential for the black fingers of the
   devil to be seen at work with the lily hands of the Redeemer?
   Impossible! That is not my judgment of the work of Satan nor will it, I
   think, be yours if you will look at it. If you never were driven either
   to blasphemy or despair by Satan, thank God you never were! You would
   have gained nothing by it--you would have been a serious loser. Let no
   man imagine that if he had been the prey of tormenting suggestions his
   conversion would have more marks of the Truth of God about it--no
   mistake can be more groundless!

   It cannot be that the devil can be of any service to anyone among you.
   He will do you damage and nothing but damage. Every blow he strikes,
   hurts but does not heal. Mr. Bunyan, himself says, when he speaks of
   Christian fighting with Apollyon, that, though he won the victory, he
   was no gainer by it. A man had better go many miles round about, over
   hedge and ditch, sooner than once come into conflict with Apollyon! All
   that is essential to conversion is found in the

   simpler way of coming at once to Jesus and, as to anything else, we
   must face it, if it comes, but certainly not look for it! It is easy to
   see how Satanic temptation hampers and how it keeps men in bondage when
   otherwise they might be at liberty, but what good it can do, in itself,
   it would be difficult to tell.

   Once again, many instances prove that all this law work and doubting
   and fearing and despairing and being tormented by Satan are not
   essential because there are scores and hundreds of Christians who came
   at once to Christ, as these two blind men did and, to this very day,
   know very little about those things. I could, if it were proper, call
   upon Brothers and Sisters who are around me at this moment who would
   tell you that when I have been preaching the experience of those who
   come to Christ with difficulty, they have been glad that it should be
   preached, but they have felt, "We know nothing of all this in our own
   experience."

   Taught from their very youth the way of God; trained by godly parents;
   they came under the influences of the Holy Spirit very early in life.
   They heard that Jesus Christ could save them. They knew that they
   needed saving and they just went to Him. I was about to say, almost as
   naturally as they went to their mother or their father when they were
   in need--they trusted the Savior and they found peace at once! Several
   of the honored leaders of this Church came to the Lord in this simple
   manner. Only yesterday I was greatly pleased with several that I saw
   who confessed faith in Jesus in a way which charmed me and yet, about
   their Christian experience there was little trace of terrible burns and
   scars. They heard the Gospel--they saw the suitability of it to their
   case--and they accepted it then and there and entered immediately into
   peace and joy.

   Now, we do not tell you that there are a few such plain cases, but we
   assert boldly that we know hosts of like instances and that there are
   thousands of God's most honored servants who are walking before Him in
   holiness and are eminently useful whose experience is as simple as A B
   C. Their whole story might be summed up in the verse--

   "I came to Jesus as I was,

   Weary and worn and sad;

   I found in Him a resting place,

   And He has made me glad."

   I will go yet further and assure you that many of those who give the
   best evidence that they are renewed by Grace cannot tell you the day in
   which they were saved and cannot attribute their conversion to any one
   sermon or to any one text of Scripture, or to any one event in life! We
   dare not doubt their conversion for their lives prove its truth. You
   may have many trees in your garden of which you must admit that you
   don't know when they were planted--but if you get plenty of fruit from
   them--you are not very particular about the date of their striking
   root.

   I am acquainted with several persons who do not know their own age. I
   was talking to one the other day who thought herself 10 years older
   than I found her out to be. I did not tell her that she was not alive
   because she did not know her birthday. If I had told her so, she would
   have laughed at me and yet there are some who fancy that they cannot be
   converted because they do not know the date of their conversion! Oh, if
   you are trusting the Savior--if He is all your salvation and all your
   desire and if your life is affected by your faith so that you bring
   forth the fruits of the Spirit, you need not worry about times and
   seasons!

   Thousands in the fold of Jesus can declare that they are in it, but the
   day that they passed through the gate is totally unknown to them.
   Thousands there are who came to Christ, not in the darkness of the
   night, but in the brightness of the day and these cannot talk of weary
   waiting and watching, though they can sing of Free Grace and dying
   love! They came joyously home to their Father's house! The sadness of
   repentance was sweetened with the delight of faith which came
   simultaneously with repentance to their hearts. I know it is so! We
   tell you but the simple Truth of God. Many young people are brought to
   the Savior to the sound of sweet music. Many, also, of another class,
   namely, the simple-minded, come in like manner. We might all wish to
   belong to that class.

   Some professors would be ashamed to be thought simple-minded, but I
   would glory in it. Too many of the doubting, critical order are great
   puzzle-makers and great fools for their pains. The childlike ones drink
   the milk while these folks are analyzing it! They seem, every night, to
   take themselves to pieces before they go to bed and it is very hard for
   them, in the morning, to put themselves together again. To some minds
   the hardest thing in the world is to believe a self-evident truth. They
   must always, if they can, make a dust and a mist and puzzle,
   themselves, or else they are not happy. In fact, they are never sure
   till they are uncertain and never at ease till they are disturbed.
   Blessed are those who believe that God cannot lie and are quite sure it
   must be so if God has said it--these cast themselves upon Christ
   whether they sink or

   swim because if Christ's salvation is God's way of saving man--it must
   be the right way and they accept it! Many, I say, have thus come to
   Christ.

   Now, proceeding a step farther, there are all the essentials of
   salvation in the simple, pleasant, happy way of coming to Jesus just as
   you are, for what are the essentials? The first is repentance and these
   dear souls, though they feel no remorse, yet hate the sin they once
   loved. Though they know no dread of Hell, yet they feel a dread of sin,
   which is a great deal better. Though they have never stood shivering
   under the gallows, yet the crime is more dreadful to them than the
   doom. They have been taught by God's Spirit to love righteousness and
   seek after holiness and this is the very essence of repentance! Those
   who thus come to Christ have certainly obtained true faith. They have
   no experience which they could trust in, but they are all the more
   fully driven to rest in what Christ has felt and done.

   They rest not in their own tears, but in Christ's blood--not in their
   own emotions, but in Christ's pangs--not in their consciousness of
   ruin, but in the certainty that Christ has come to save all those that
   trust Him. They have faith of the purest kind! And see, too, how
   certainly they have love. "Faith works by love" and they show it. They
   often seem to have more love at the first than those who come so
   dreadfully burdened and tempest-tossed, for, in the calm quiet of their
   minds they get a fairer view of the beauties of the Savior and they
   burn with love to Him and they commence to serve Him while others, as
   yet, are having their wounds healed and are trying to make their broken
   bones rejoice.

   I am not wishing to depreciate a painful experience, but I am only
   trying to show as to this second class, that their simple coming to
   Christ, as the blind men came--their simply believing that He could
   give them sight--is not one whit inferior to the other and has in it
   all the essentials of salvation. For, next, notice that the Gospel
   command implies in itself nothing of the kind which some have
   experienced. What are we bid to preach to men--"Be dragged about by the
   devil and you shall be saved"? No, but, "Believe in the Lord Jesus
   Christ and you shall be saved." What is my commission at this time? To
   say to you, "Despair and you shall be saved"? No, verily, but, "Believe
   and you shall be saved."

   Are we to come here and say, "Torture yourself! Mangle your heart,
   scourge your spirit, grind your very soul to powder in desperation"?
   No, but, "Believe in the infinite goodness and mercy of God in the
   Person of His dear Son and come and trust Him." That is the Gospel
   command! It is put in various forms. This is one--"Look unto Me and be
   you saved, all the ends of the earth." Now, if I were to come and say,
   "Tear your eyes out," that would not be the Gospel, would it? No, but
   "Look!" The Gospel does not say, "Cry your eyes out," but, "Look!" And
   it does not say, "Blind your eyes with a hot iron." No, but, "Look,
   look, look!" It is just the very opposite of anything like remorse,
   despair and blasphemous thought. It is just, "Look."

   Then it is put in another shape. We are told to take of the Water of
   Life freely. We are bid to drink of the eternal spring of love and
   life. What are we told to do? To make this Water of Life scalding hot?
   No. We are to drink it as it freely flows out of the Fountain. Are we
   to make it drip after the manner of the Inquisition, a drop at a time
   and to lie under it and feel the perpetual drip of a scanty trickling?
   Nothing of the sort! We are just to step down to the Fountain and drink
   and be content, for it will quench our thirst! What is the Gospel,
   again? Is it not to eat the Bread of Heaven? "Eat you that which is
   good." There is the Gospel banquet and we are to compel men to come
   in--and what are they to do when they come in? Silently to look on
   while others eat? Stand and wait till they feel more hungry? Try 40
   days' fasting, like Dr. Tanner? Nothing of the sort!

   You might think this to be the Gospel by the way some people preach and
   act, but it is not so. You are to feast on Christ at once! You need not
   fast till you turn yourself into a living skeleton and then come to
   Christ. I am sent with no such message as that, but this is my word of
   good cheer--"Listen diligently to me and eat that which is good and let
   your soul delight itself in fatness. He--everyone--that thirsts, come
   to the waters and he that has no money, let him come, buy wine and
   milk, without money and without price." Freely take what God freely
   gives and simply trust the Savior! Is not that the Gospel? Well, then,
   why should any of you say, "I cannot trust Christ because I don't feel
   this and don't feel that"?

   Do I not solemnly assure you that I have known of many who have come to
   Christ just as they were--who have never undergone those horrible
   feelings which are so much spoken of and yet have been most truly
   saved? Come as you are! Do not try to make a righteousness out of your
   unrighteousness, or a confidence out of your unbelief, or a Christ out
   of your blasphemies as some seem to do! Nor dote so foolishly as to
   imagine that despair may be a ground of hope. It cannot be! You are to
   get out of self and into Christ and there you will be safe. As the
   blind men said, when Christ asked them, "Do

   you believe that I am able to do this?" so are you to say to Him, "Yes,
   Lord." Trust yourself with your Savior and He is your Savior!

   III. I conclude with one more observation--THOSE PERSONS WHO ARE
   PRIVILEGED TO COME TO JESUS

   CHRIST SOFTLY, PLEASANTLY AND HAPPILY ARE NOT LOSERS. They do lose
   something, certainly, but there

   is not much in it. They lose somewhat of the picturesque and they have
   less to tell. When a man has had a long series of trials to drive him
   out of himself and, at last, comes to Christ like a wrecked vessel
   tugged into port, he has a story to talk of and write about and,
   perhaps, he thinks it interesting to be able to tell. And, if he can
   tell it to God's Glory, it is quite proper that he should. Many of
   these stories are found in biographies because they are the incidents
   which excite interest and make a life worth writing about--but you must
   not conclude that all godly lives are of the same sort.

   Happy are those whose lives could not be written because they were so
   happy as to be uneventful. Some of the most favored lives do not get
   written because there is nothing very picturesque about them. But I ask
   you this--when those blind men came to Christ just as they were and
   said that they believed that He could open their eyes and He did open
   their eyes--is there not as much of Christ in their story as there well
   could be? The men, themselves, are nowhere--the healing Master is in
   the foreground! More detail might almost take away the peculiar
   prominence that He has in it all. There He stands, the blessed,
   glorious Opener of the eyes of the two blind men! There He stands and
   His name is glorious!

   There was a woman who had spent all her substance upon physicians and
   was nothing better, but rather grew worse. She had a long tale to tell
   of the various doctors she had been to, but I do not know that the
   narrative of her many disappointments would glorify the Lord Jesus one
   bit more than when these two blind men could say, "We heard of Him and
   we went to Him and He opened our eyes! We never spent a halfpenny upon
   doctors. We went straightaway to Jesus, just as we were, and all He
   said to us was, 'Do you think that I can do it?' and we said, 'Yes, we
   believe You can,' and He opened our eyes at once and it was all done."
   Oh, if my experience should ever stand in my Master's light, perish my
   best experience! Let Christ be first, last, midst--don't you agree, my
   Brothers and Sisters?

   If you, poor Sinner, come to Christ at once with nothing about you
   whatever that you ever can talk of--if you are just a nobody coming to
   the ever-blessed Everybody--if you are a mere nothing coming to Him who
   is the All-in-All! If you are a lump of sin and misery, a great vacuum,
   nothing but an emptiness that never is thought of any more--if you will
   come and lose yourselves in His infinitely glorious Grace--this will be
   all that is needed! It seems to me that you will lose nothing by the
   fact that there is not so much of the picturesque and the sensational
   in your experience. There will be, at least, this grand sensation--lost
   in self but saved in Jesus--glory be to His name! Perhaps you may
   suppose that persons who come thus gently lose something by way of
   evidence afterwards. "Ah," said one to me, "I could almost wish,
   sometimes, that I had been an open offender so that I might see the
   change in my character. But, having been always moral from my youth up,
   I am not always able to see any distinct sign of a change."

   Ah, let me tell you, Friends, that this form of evidence is of small
   use in times of darkness, for if the devil cannot say to a man, "You
   have not changed your life"--for there are some that he would not have
   the impudence to say that to, since the change is too manifest for him
   to deny it--he says, "You changed your actions, but your heart is still
   the same. You turned from a bold, honest sinner to be a hypocritical,
   canting professor! That is all you have done! You have given up open
   sin because your strong passions declined, or you thought you would
   like another way of sinning--and now you are only making a false
   profession and living far from what you should do." Very little
   consolation is to be had even out of the change that conversion works
   when once the arch-enemy becomes our accuser.

   In fact, it comes to this--however you come to Christ you can never
   place any confidence in how you came. Your confidence must always rest
   in Him to whom you came--that is, in Christ--whether you come to Him
   flying, or running, or walking. If you get to Jesus you are all right!
   It is not how you come--it is whether you come to Him! Have you come to
   Jesus? Do you come to Jesus? If you have come and you doubt whether you
   have come, come again! Never quarrel with Satan about whether you are a
   Christian. If he says you are a sinner, reply to him, "So I am, but
   Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners and I will begin
   again." He is an old lawyer, you know, and very cunning. He knows how
   to baffle us, for we do not understand things as well as he does.

   He has been, these thousands of years, at the trade of trying to make
   Christians doubt their interest in Christ and he understands it well.
   Never answer him! Refer him to your Solicitor--tell him you have an
   Advocate on high who will answer him. Tell him you will fly away to
   Christ, again. If you never went to Jesus before, you will go now and,
   if you

   have been before, you will go again! That is the way to end the
   quarrel. As to evidences, they are fine things in fine weather, but
   when the tempest is out, wise men let evidences go. The best evidence a
   man can have that he is saved is that he is still clinging to Christ!

   Lastly, some may suppose that those who come gently to Christ may lose
   a good deal of adaptation for later usefulness because they will not be
   able to sympathize with those who are in deep perplexity and in awful
   straits when they are coming to Christ. Ah, well, there are enough of
   us who can sympathize with such and I do not know that everybody is
   bound to sympathize with everybody in every respect. I remember
   mentioning, one day, to a man who had considerable property, that his
   poor minister had a large family and could scarcely keep a coat on his
   back. I said I wondered how some Christian men who profited under the
   ministry of such a man did not supply his needs.

   He answered that he thought it was a good thing for ministers to be
   poor because they could sympathize with the poor. I said, "Yes, yes,
   but then, don't you see, there ought to be one or two that are not poor
   to sympathize with those who are rich." I would go one better,
   certainly, and let the poor pastor, now and then, have the power to
   sympathize with both classes! He did not seem to understand my
   argument, but I think there is a good deal in it. It is a great mercy
   to have some Brethren around us who, by their painful experience, can
   sympathize with those who have been through that pain. But don't you
   think it is a great mercy to have others who, through not having
   undergone that experience, can sympathize with others who have not
   undergone it?

   Is it not useful to have some who can say, "Well, dear Heart, don't be
   troubled because the great dog of Hell did not howl at you. If you have
   entered the gate calmly and quietly and Christ has received you, do not
   be troubled because you are not barked at by the devil, for I, too,
   came to Jesus just as gently and safely and sweetly as you have done"?
   Such a testimony will comfort the poor soul and so, if you lose the
   power to sympathize one way, you will gain the power to sympathize in
   another--and there will be no great loss, after all. To sum it all
   up--I would that every man and woman and child here would come and
   trust the Lord Jesus Christ! It seems to me to be such a matchless plan
   of salvation--for Christ to take human sin and to suffer in the
   sinner's stead and for us to have nothing to do but just to accept what
   Christ has done and to trust ourselves wholly with Him!

   He that would not be saved by such a plan as this deserves to
   perish--and so he will! Was there ever so sweet, so sure and so plain a
   Gospel? It is a joy to preach it! Will you have it? Dear Souls, will
   you not yield to be nothing and have Jesus to be All in All? God grant
   that none of us may reject this way of Grace, this open way, this safe
   way. Come, linger no longer. The Spirit and the bride say "Come." Lord,
   draw them by the love of Jesus! Amen.

Asleep and Yet Awake--a Riddle

   (No. 1561)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, OCTOBER 10, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I sleep, but my heart is awake: it is the voice of my Beloved that
   knocks." Song of Solomon 5:2.

   WE are glad to perceive in this Song the varied experience of the
   bride. She was the well-beloved of the heavenly Bridegroom, but she was
   not without her faults. Though the "fairest among women," she was human
   and, therefore, she had not reached angelical perfection. She was not
   perfect, to begin with, for at the outset she confessed, "I am black,
   because the sun has looked upon me: they made me the keeper of the
   vineyards; but my own vineyard have I not kept." She was not perfect
   even in the exhibition of her love to Him who had chosen her, for she
   has to acknowledge, as upon the occasion before us, that she treated
   Him in an unworthy manner. She kept Him waiting at her door in the
   chilly night and grieved Him so that He withdrew. She was not perfect,
   even, to the end of the chapter, for she could not hear her Lord's
   voice so clearly as certain of her companions and she cried in the last
   chapter of her Song, "Cause me to hear it."

   Brothers and Sisters, we shall not be able to claim entire perfection
   so long as we are this side the hills of division. Till the day breaks
   and the shadows flee away, our Lord will have to sanctify and cleanse
   His spouse "with the washing of water by the Word, that He might
   present it to Himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle,
   or any such thing." We are glad, I say, to have the experience of the
   spouse--that is, of the Church as a whole--because we know that as is
   the Church, such are the members and the rule that holds good for the
   whole will be found in its measure and proportion to be fulfilled in
   all its parts. We, too, have to say, "I am black, because the sun has
   looked upon me."

   And at times we have to ask, "Why should I be as one that turns aside
   by the flocks of your companions?" We have had mournfully to cry, "I
   sought Him, but I could not find Him; I called Him, but He gave me no
   answer," while the watchmen have justly smitten us and wounded us for
   our neglect of our Lord. Let us bless God that in the Book of revealed
   Truth He has not merely given us the ideal standard after which we are
   to seek, but He has also preserved for us the humbler patterns of those
   who have strived to reach to the utmost height and who have climbed a
   good way towards it, but who, nevertheless, have proved that, though
   they were the best of men, they were men at the best. Thus our Lord has
   saved us from despair by making us to know that we may be sincere and
   true and accepted, though we, too, fall short as yet of the holiness
   which we pant after with our whole hearts.

   Nor are we only favored with the poetic story of the bride--we have,
   also, in the Word of God, the biographies of the saints, the memoirs of
   the godly and these are exceedingly useful to us. I fear we would not,
   Brothers and Sisters, at certain times, know whether we were God's
   people at all if we were not able to compare ourselves with others of
   the family. We may lose our way, sometimes, as poor sheep have often
   done and then, though the greatest comfort is derived from seeing the
   footprints of the Shepherd, yet no small measure of consolation is to
   be gained through marking the footsteps of the flock. The sight of
   human footsteps on the sandy waste has caused us to take heart again.

   We have exclaimed, "Here one has been who was surely a child of God and
   since I am here, I may be a child of God, too. I have similar failings
   and weaknesses and I chide myself for them, but I will not utterly
   condemn myself and say I cannot be a Believer, for I perceive that
   these spots were on others of God's children, too." The perception of
   our likeness to others who were truly saints has often afforded us a
   spark of hope when we were in a maze and dared scarcely hope that we
   were right towards God. Frequently the experience of others will help
   us to thread our way when it winds and twists and we cannot see an inch
   before us.

   The young man thinks that he understands himself, but no old man does.
   Ask the man who is best acquainted with himself and he will tell you
   that he is increasingly a riddle and that his experience becomes an
   enigma more profound every day. The Believer feels that he needs the
   help of the Divine Teacher to enable him to trace the thread of his
   spiritual life throughout all the tangle of the skein. It needs a
   Grace-taught man to make himself out and to comprehend what he is and
   where he

   is and what is the very truth of his life's paradox. At times I ask
   myself, "Am I all sin, or is there yet a spark of Grace?" Soon Grace
   shines like the sun and then I almost dream that sin is extinct! We are
   driven to read ourselves in others. We look at the saints of Holy
   Scripture and, as we mark their lives, we say, "I can understand this
   man better than I can myself, for lookers-on see more than players. And
   now, by understanding him, I begin, also, to comprehend my own
   position. I calculate my latitude and longitude by observing a star. I
   estimate the contending influences that rage within me by seeing how
   others drifted, or stemmed the torrent. I see the strange convolutions
   of my intertwisted soul in others and, as in a glass, I discern
   myself."

   But, my Brothers and Sisters, we must take care that we do not wrongly
   use the memoirs of saints as recorded in Scrip-ture--they are not all
   for our imitation, but many of them for our warning! You may not do all
   that a good man has done. If you were to copy certain of the actions of
   the most gracious men, you would soon find yourself more faulty than
   they, for you would be sure to throw the emphasis upon their
   errors--and their Graces you would probably miss. You would copy their
   faults and aggravate them. Follow no man where he does not follow
   Christ! Above all, the lives of the saints may never be used as an
   excuse for our faults. We shall not be justified in following afar off
   because Peter did so, nor in calling fire from Heaven upon our enemies
   because James and John wished to do so, nor in quarrelling because Paul
   and Barnabas fell into sore contention.

   We may wisely quote David as an encouragement to a penitent, that God
   will forgive his sin, but not as an apology for ourselves should we be
   tempted to commit the sin. We must often use the saints of God as
   beacons rather than as harbor-lights--as lighthouses set upon rocky
   coasts to advise us of the dangers into which they fell. Take care that
   Holy Scripture is used for holy ends and that holy men are viewed as
   helps to holiness and not as excuses for imperfection. Let us learn
   from their virtues, imitation--but from their faults, warning--and from
   both, instruction. Judgment is profitable to direct. Follow the Lamb
   wherever He goes, but there is not a sheep of His flock to whom you may
   do the same. Do whatever Jesus does--copy the example of Christ in all
   its touches, so far as it is imitable--but do not the same even towards
   the beloved John, though his head is fresh from his Master's bosom--no,
   nor towards Paul, though he is not a whit behind the very chief of the
   Apostles.

   We come, then, dear Friends, to use the example of our text with those
   limitations which we have thus set forth. We have in the text, first,
   slumber confessed--"I sleep." But over against this there is
   wakefulness claimed--"but my heart is awake." Very soon we have mystery
   solved--how is it that the heart stays awake?--"It is the voice of my
   Beloved that knocks." Before we close we shall try, fourthly, to have a
   lesson learned out of the text. May the Holy Spirit make the whole
   subject profitable to us and practically influential upon our lives.

   I. First, then, here is SLUMBER CONFESSED. The spouse laments her state
   and sighs out, "I sleep." It strikes us at once that her sleep is a
   recognized state. We are astonished that she should say, "I sleep," and
   we conclude that it is not so profound a sleep as it might be, for when
   a man can say, "I sleep," he is not altogether steeped in slumber! When
   children of God perceive their own imperfections and mourn over them,
   there is evidently a root of virtue in them--when they perceive the
   decay of their Grace there is some Grace left undecayed with which they
   are bemoaning their decline! I would not give you encouragement, dear
   Brothers and Sisters, if you are asleep at all, to continue in it, but
   yet I would say this, that if you mourn over your sluggishness, you are
   not altogether a sluggard--if you feel uneasy in your dullness you are
   not altogether given over to spiritual stupidity--if you are anxious to
   be awakened out of your slumber, it is certain that you are not given
   over to sleep yourself into the sepulcher of insensibility.

   God be thanked that you cannot enjoy pleasant dreams upon the bed of
   carelessness! You do not sleep as do others-- you are evidently not
   steeped in that fatal slumber of spiritual death in which the dead
   world is slumbering all around. Infinite Mercy has had some dealings
   with you and has made you to be spiritually awake so far that you can
   feel that you sleep and mournfully confess it. When a man detects pride
   within him but has Grace enough to long to be humble; when a man feels
   hardness of heart but groans about it and wishes to be softened; when a
   man laments the stubbornness of his will and cries to God to give him
   full submission; when a man mourns a sluggishness of heart and strives
   after quickening--then he has marks and signs of spiritual life and of
   an inward energy which will, by God's Grace, cast out his disease and
   bring him spiritual health!

   There is life where there is pain! There is growth where there is a
   yearning of desire! The holy fire still lingers in the breast, though
   it is so smothered by the ashes that only a little smoke can be
   discerned. It will revive again; it will kindle

   and burn up, for it is of God's creating. He who can mournfully say, "I
   sleep," will, one day, be wide awake. Be very thankful, therefore, when
   you have a tender conscience! Cultivate a quick perception and when you
   are aware of the slightest defalcation or decline, confess at once to
   God that you begin to sleep. Further, as this sleep is a matter
   recognized, so is it a matter complained of. The spouse is not pleased
   to sleep--she says, "I sleep," but she does not mention it as a matter
   for congratulation! She is not pleased with her condition.

   Here, again, I would remark that it is well for saints, when they
   perceive that they are in the least degree backsliding, that they
   should mourn before God and accuse themselves before Him. "Judge
   yourselves, that you be not judged." Before another person can hint
   that you are careless, find it out, yourself, and mourn over it. Before
   another can complain of your dullness and say, as the shipmen did to
   Jonah, "What do you mean, O sleeper?" complain about yourself. Act
   tenderly to others, but severely towards yourselves. So all prudent men
   will do if God keeps them prudent. This sleepiness is not a thing to be
   indulged in, but to be abhorred. To say the least of it, it is a low
   state of enjoyment. Sleep is peaceful and quiet, but it cannot enjoy
   the sweets of the senses and the delights which the mind can receive.

   Sleep is Death's cousin and he that slumbers lies at the door of the
   sepulcher. The image of death is set upon the sleeper's face and it is
   a miracle and a sort of foretaste of the Resurrection that any man does
   wake again after he has fallen into a deep slumber. It is not,
   therefore, good spiritually for us to be asleep, for then we cannot
   taste the honey of the Word of God, nor enjoy the fragrance of the
   ordinances, nor see the beauties of Christ--nor will any of the
   spiritual passions be delighted, nor our spirit be carried away with
   holy joy. Therefore, when we come into God's House and we hear the old
   familiar story of the Cross and it does not charm us, let us mournfully
   say, "I sleep."

   When others are ready to dance before the Lord with exultation while
   singing the solemn Psalm, if we, ourselves, feel no devout gratitude,
   let us cry self-complainingly, "I perceive that I sleep." And when at
   the Table the chosen emblems of the bread and wine do not bring the
   Master near to us and we go away as hungry as we came because we have
   not fed on His body and His blood, then let us say, again, "Alas, I
   sleep, I sleep! For these things would be most sweet and nourishing to
   me if my spiritual faculties were as they ought to be!" If we fail to
   enjoy the banquets of our Bridegroom's love, it must be because a
   deadness is stealing over us and we are not so thoroughly alive and
   awake as we were in days gone by--and this is a condition to be
   deplored as soon as it is perceived.

   We ought to complain of ourselves if we sleep because it is a state of
   danger. While men slept, the enemy came and sowed tares among the
   wheat. It is bad, then, to have a drowsy minister and drowsy Church
   officers, for these will not watch the fields for God. He who sleeps is
   in danger of the thief or the murderer. While Saul lay stretched on the
   plain, Abishai lifted up his spear and said, "Let me smite him but this
   once." He who sleeps may lose his all, yes, lose himself. Let us,
   therefore, dread this perilous state and, if we feel it creeping over
   us, let us shake ourselves and say, "I sleep, but I will not give way
   to slumber! Lord, by Your Grace, awaken me!"

   Sleep is a state of inaction. A man cannot do his daily business while
   his eyes are closed in slumber. There is a sleepwalking which can do
   much, but I know of no spiritual sleepwalking. You cannot walk the road
   to Heaven asleep, nor preach the Gospel as you should, nor serve God
   and your generation aright if you are in a spiritual slumber. I know a
   great many who are so--they are alive, I hope, but very sleepy! They do
   very little; they are too sluggish to attempt much. "The slothful man
   says, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets." This was
   his argument for keeping in the chimney corner. In truth, the lion is
   about as real as the monster which has been described of late as
   prowling over this county of Surrey and devouring women and children
   all the way from Banstead Downs to Clapham Common!

   Solomon seems to have been very familiar with this fable of the
   sluggard's lion, for in another proverb he makes the idler cry, "There
   is a lion outside! I shall be slain in the streets!" These poor
   creatures are so dreamy in spirit that they see a lion
   everywhere--threatening them if they try to do good in any form! They
   must sit quiet and still and try to enjoy themselves as best their
   sleep will allow them to do, for they cannot venture out to work
   because of the lion! They cannot teach a little Sunday school class,
   for there is a lion there! Nor go out to speak to a dozen people in a
   village--a furious lion is roaring there! In fact, they will be
   devoured if they leave their easy retirement and put their heads out of
   doors. God help us to escape this lazy condition! May we live while we
   live! Let not our souls merely act as salt to keep our carcasses from
   rotting, but let them be the seed plot and hotbed of holy actions out
   of which shall yet spring glory to God and blessing to our fellow men.
   If you do not feel active and energetic, make it a matter of
   self-complaint and utter the shame-faced confession, "I sleep."

   Yet again, this slumber should be not only a matter of complaint as an
   evil to be dreaded, but it should be regarded as a fault to be ashamed
   of. A Christian man should not say, "I feel dull, careless and
   inactive," and make the confession as if he almost deserved to be
   pitied for a misfortune which was no fault of his. My Brothers and
   Sisters, you may be pitied, but you are, also, to be blamed, perhaps
   blamed far more than pitied! An apparent spiritual slumber may creep
   over us because the body is very weak and sickly and here pity is
   allowable, yes, justly due. Certain states and conditions of the flesh,
   no doubt, will overcome the spirit, as when even the choicest of the
   Apostles slept in the garden. The Master at first said, "What? Could
   you not watch with Me one hour?" But afterwards He made a generous
   excuse for them and said, "The spirit is truly willing, but the flesh
   is weak." Make excuses for others and let your Lord make excuses for
   you, but do not frame apologies on your own account.

   David writes in the Psalm, "I said, This is my infirmity." Quite right,
   David. I dare say it was so. But the other day I said the same of
   myself and before long I answered to my conscience for it, for
   conscience asked, "Is it not your sin as well as your infirmity?" I was
   compelled to divide the statement, no, at last to withdraw the first
   part of it altogether and cry, "God be merciful to me, a sinner!" May
   we not be too ready to lay the blame of our impatience, our unbelief,
   or our hastiness upon the body when we ought to take all blame to
   ourselves? It is always safest to blame ourselves and it is frequently
   dangerous to make an excuse. Still, sometimes dullness may be an
   infirmity. When a man is weary with a hard day's work, or with business
   that has cost him long care and he kneels by his bedside at a very late
   hour to pray and finds himself going to sleep, I do not think that his
   fault is a very grievous one.

   It is certainly not that dreadful sin which shall never be forgiven,
   either in this world or in that which is to come! When a man is brought
   very low by weakness of body and he cannot, on the Sabbath, feel
   himself up to the mark in all respects, I do not think we should hold a
   Church meeting and turn him out! Nor do I think that he should
   excommunicate himself! When a widowed spirit is broken with bereavement
   when the husband is dead; when children or brothers have died; when
   parents have been snatched away and the heart is very heavy--if the
   heart cannot rejoice in the Lord, it is a pity that it cannot--but
   there is a measure of infirmity as well as fault in the heaviness of
   the soul. In such cases good people may guardedly say with David, "This
   is my infirmity." May God help us when we feel such infirmities that we
   may speedily rise above them, being made strong in weakness and being
   taught to glory in infirmities because the power of Christ rests upon
   us.

   Again, I repeat it--for others we may put in the gentle word even as
   the Master did for His disciples--"The spirit truly is willing, but the
   flesh is weak," but for ourselves we should rather use heart-searching
   and self-condemnation that we may make the bed of slumber thorny to our
   idle flesh. Brothers and Sisters, when a Christian's soul is heavy with
   slumber, he ought to be ashamed. Think of who it is that loved us, even
   Jesus, the eternal Son of God! Has He loved us and can we ever be cold
   towards Him? Then blush and let the scarlet abide in the face! Think of
   what Jesus has done for us and what love He has manifested towards us.
   O Gethsemane! O Calvary! Are we thus redeemed and after this does our
   love decline into slumber? Break, my Heart! Break with indignation at
   yourself that such should be the case!

   And what is this time in which we live? A time in which all the powers
   of darkness are on the alert, raging to do evil and mischief. Are we
   sleeping now, when the adversary is daily making an attack upon us?
   When men are dying and are perishing by millions, can it be that we
   slumber? And such as we are, who do little enough when we are wide
   awake and have little enough of power and ability--how is it that we
   can slumber? If we are lethargic, should we not bow ourselves in the
   dust before God and beseech Him to have mercy upon us? Furthermore, it
   is an evil to be fought against. When a man is obliged to say, "I
   sleep," let him not content himself with sleeping on. Now is the time
   for much prayer! Let him wrestle with this deadly foe till he is fully
   awakened!

   Falling into indifference on the road to Heaven is something like
   sleeping on the vast plains of snow, where, if a man gives way to the
   natural inclination to slumber which comes on through the intense cold,
   he may lie down and never rise again! Oh, take care, you that are
   looking for Heaven and eternal life, that you yield not to sleep, for
   your Master comes and it may be that within another hour you may hear
   the midnight cry! Let us whip ourselves with a strong resolve that we
   will not sleep. Let us say unto our soul, "Come, wake up! My spirit,
   you shall not sleep. This cannot be. I must not have it, I will not, I
   dare not. I will goad you, I will crucify you to the cross, for you
   shall not slay yourself with suicidal slumber."

   With this resolve let us seek out means of waking ourselves up.
   Sometimes we may do well to seek for a better ministry than we have
   attended. Alas, there are ministries which are as cradles to rock babes
   to sleep! There are preachers who charm most wisely if their intent is
   to send the universe to sleep. Beware of preaching which comforts you
   in idleness and increases

   your spiritual insensibility! There are certain preachers who mar the
   Gospel and tell their tale so heartlessly that I think if all Heaven
   did rock and reel with tempest, a man might yet sleep on so long as
   such soothing voices lulled his ears. We cannot afford to waste our
   Sabbaths in listening to another Gospel, or in hearing lullabies which
   make us duller than we were.

   But if you cannot reach a rousing ministry, read good books--turn to
   solid Gospel treatises, such as the Puritans bequeathed us. Search the
   Scriptures and the works of godly men whose words were all on
   fire--these thrown upon your soul like burning coals may set it on
   fire. Christian conversation, too, is another useful means of keeping
   us awake. John Bunyan mentions that in going over the Enchanted Ground
   the pilgrims, to prevent drowsiness, fell into good discourse. Here is
   his quaint rhyme about it--

   "When saints do sleepy grow, let them come here And hear how these two
   pilgrims talk together: Yes, let them learn of them in any wise, Thus
   to keep open their drowsy, slumbering eyes, Saints 'fellowship, if it
   is managed well, Keeps them awake and that in spite of Hell.'" Imitate
   this example, but if discourse does not avail, get to work for Christ!
   This is a very effective way of keeping yourself awake, God the Holy
   Spirit blessing you in it. In looking after the souls of others, your
   own soul will receive a watering.

   I do not think that soul-slumber so often visits the active as it does
   those who have little to do in the Master's service. If active service
   does not suffice, then cry mightily to God, "I sleep, my Savior! Awake
   me, I pray You!" You are half awake, already, if you can cry in that
   fashion. Cry again, "I sleep, my Lord! Use even a rod upon me to wake
   me rather than I should slumber." You are not asleep, Brother, Sister,
   you are already awakened--the bitter anguish of the soul in its horror
   of its own slumber has already been blessed of God to its awakening.
   Anyway, this sleep is an evil which must be overcome. Come, make up
   your minds, today, members of this Church, that you will not yield to
   drowsiness!

   I hope none of you are inclined to say, "Well, I may get to Heaven in
   this sleepy way and so what does it matter? My fellow members would put
   me in the ambulance and carry me along like a wounded soldier and this
   will be easier than marching at the double, day after day." No, no, my
   Brothers and Sisters, we have enough of the invalid and wounded
   already! We have as many as we can carry of the non-effectives. We need
   no more. Ask the blessed Physician to make you strong so that you may
   tug at the guns with the rest of us, or charge the enemy at bayonet
   point when the trumpet sounds. I said, years ago, I would sooner lead a
   dozen real live earnest Christians than a dozen hundred of the
   half-and-half sort and this feeling grows with me!

   I would almost as soon not be a Christian as be as some Christians
   are--they have enough religion to make them uncomfortable, but not
   enough to make them useful. They drink such shallow draughts that they
   increase their responsibility rather than their energy. Oh, for a deep
   draught of Grace which shall fill us with all the fullness of God and
   make us men in Christ to the utmost capacity of our sanctified manhood!
   Cold meat may be pleasant, but cold religion is an ill dish to serve to
   Christ or to ourselves! God make us like those creatures that are said
   to live in the fire. May He fill us with His own Spirit and make us
   burn and blaze with an unquenchable heat of love towards Him of whom it
   is said that the zeal of God's house did eat Him up. He poured out His
   soul unto death that He might redeem us to Himself--let us see to it
   that we are altogether His own. With this I leave the sleeping for
   another theme.

   II. We reach the point of the paradox--here is WATCHFULNESS CLAIMED by
   one who confessed to sleep. "My heart is awake," says the Bride, "I
   sleep, but my heart is awake." It may seem an odd thing to sleep and
   yet to be awake, but I commenced by saying that the Christian is a
   great puzzle. Ralph Erskine's, "Believer's Riddle," is a remarkable
   production, but every word of it may be justified by experience and by
   Scripture. A man is a mass of contradictions, but a man in Christ is
   far more so. He truly says--

   I'm in my own and others' eyes

   A labyrinth of mysteries." We are asleep and awake at the same time. As
   Erskine rhymes it--

   "Both sleeping flesh I have, that rests

   In sloth unto my shame,

   And waking Grace, that still protests

   Against this lazy frame."

   There is an inner life within every Christian which can never die and
   there is about him an inward death which can never rise to life. Jesus
   said, "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water
   springing up into everlasting life." Therefore this Divine Life, though
   it may grow weak and feeble and slumbering, yet never passes into the
   condition of absolute death, or even of complete insensibility.
   Somewhat of Heaven is about the man of God when the earth encompasses
   him most. "Sin shall not have dominion over you"--God still has the
   throne, even when Satan rages most. This inward life usually shows
   itself in the uneasiness of the declining heart. When a Believer feels
   that he is not what he ought to be, nor what he wants to be, he cannot
   be happy. He cannot rest and be content. There was a time when such a
   condition would have satisfied him, but now he is distressed beyond
   measure and, like Noah's dove, finds no rest for the sole of his feet.
   Hear him sing in the minor key--

   "Where is the blessedness I knew

   When first I sa w the Lord?

   Where is the soul-refreshing view

   Of Jesus and His Word?

   What peaceful hours I then enjoyed!

   How sweet their memory still!

   But they have left an aching void

   The world can never fill." He sleeps, but his heart beats, sighs and
   palpitates with dire unrest!

   The inner life shows itself, also, in desire, for the heart is the seat
   of desire and it leads the man to say, "I am not what I would like to
   be. I live at a poor dying rate--Christ's love is so great to me and
   mine to Him so chill. Lord, lift me out of this frozen state. I cannot
   bear this grave of lethargy. Lord, bring my soul out of prison! Give me
   more Grace. Give me Grace to love Jesus better and to be more like He
   is. Poor as I am, I long to be enriched by Your love and mercy. O visit
   me with Your salvation!" Such a pleading heart is still awake though
   the mind may be dull. The Lord judges us by our earnest desires more
   than by our accomplishments.

   An old writer says if you send a man on horseback for the doctor, if
   the horse is a sorry jade that cannot move quickly, you praise the man
   when you see him whipping and spurring and doing his best to hurry the
   horse along. You do not blame him for that which is beyond his power.
   So he says, oftentimes, when our desires whip and spur our languid
   spirits, God sees what a rate we would go at if we could and He takes
   the will for the deed. Often our desires are so awakened that we would
   harness the lightning and bit the tempest if we could and spur both to
   a swifter speed! Desires prove wakefulness--"I sleep, but my heart is
   awake."

   The spouse gave another proof of her wakefulness by her discernment.
   She says, "It is the voice of my Beloved that knocks." Even when half
   asleep she knew her Lord's voice. You may catch a true Believer at his
   worst, but he still knows the Gospel from everything else and can
   detect another Gospel in a moment! You shall come forth with all your
   eloquence, your poetry and sweet concocted phrases--with a something
   that is not the Gospel of the blessed God and you shall, for a moment,
   please the ears of the Christian because of the literary excellence of
   your address. But he soon detects you. It is true of all Christ's
   sheep, "A stranger they will not follow, for they know not the voice of
   strangers."

   The awakening Believer perceives that the most musical voice of a
   stranger has not the charm in it which is found in the voice of His
   Lord. Yes, he soon closes his ears to it in disgust and in holy
   trembling lest he should be deceived. His resolve is, "I will hear what
   God the Lord will speak." He determines to be deaf to other voices, but
   to his Redeemer he says, "Speak, Lord, for Your servant hears." Blessed
   is he who in his dullest state can still discern and discriminate and
   cry, "It is the voice of my Beloved."

   This wakefulness of heart shows itself often in the soul chiding
   itself. "I sleep," she says. She would not have blamed herself as I
   have tried to describe her doing if she had not been, in some measure,
   awake. This blessed living wakefulness within the heart will,
   by-and-by, display itself in action. The heart will wake up all that is
   within us and we shall hasten to our Beloved. It is wonderful how a
   true Christian flies back to his God as soon as the Spirit of the Lord
   sets him free from the net. "Whom have I in Heaven but You and there is
   none upon earth that I desire besides You." Brothers and Sisters, you
   and I cannot rest anywhere short of Christ! When we were ravens, we
   could rest on our own wings, or on the carrion of this world--but now
   that we have been made doves, we must seek our Noah and His ark!

   A friend at the back of this Tabernacle furnished me with some pigeons
   but a little while ago. They were taken home to Norwood and shut up for
   a few days and well fed in the hope that they would stay with us. But
   no sooner were they set at liberty than they soared aloft, made three
   circles in the sky and then flew direct for this spot. How I wished, on
   my sick bed, that I had their wings and could hasten here, too! It is
   so with Believers. The devil may put us in captivity and shut us up
   awhile, but give us the opportunity and our heart knows the way back to
   Jesus!

   The spouse has dove's eyes and she sees from afar. She makes short work
   of it and is back, again, with all the speed of the chariots of
   Amminadib! This puzzle of, "I sleep, but my heart is awake," has been
   experienced by thousands. I quote no solitary instances--there are
   hundreds of the same. I lately met with a little poem by Thomas Vaughan
   which touched my heart because it so aptly described my state. I will
   read it, to show you that the paradox of a Believer's life is no
   fiction of mine, but is the frequent experience of God's people. In a
   little out-of-the way poem, which perhaps no one of you has ever seen,
   Vaughan quaintly sings--

   "My sweetest Jesus! 'Twas Your voice,

   'If I am lifted up I'll draw all to the sky,'

   Yet I am here! I'm stifled in the clay,

   Shut up from You and the fresh feast of day. I know Your hand's not
   short, but I'm unfit, A foul, unclean thing to take hold of it! I am
   all dirt! Nor can I hope to please

   Unless in mercy You love a disease. Diseases may be cured, but who'll
   reprieve Him that is dead? Tell me, my God, I live.

   'Tis true, I live: but I so sleep that I cannot move, scarcely hear
   when You call! Sin's lullabies charm me when I would come But draw me
   after You and I will run.

   You know I'm sick: let me not feasted be, But keep a diet, all
   prescribed by Thee.

   Should I carve for myself, I would exceed

   To surfeits soon and by self-murder bleed.

   I ask for stones and scorpions, but still crest And all for love:
   should not You grant, I were lost. Dear Lord, deny me still: and never
   sign My will, but when that will agrees with Yours And when this
   conflict's past and I appear

   To answer, what a patient I was here, How I did weep when You did woo:
   repine At Your best sweets and in a childish whine Refuse Your
   proffered love; yet cry and call, For rattles of my own to play withal:
   Look on Your Cross and let Your blood come in

   When mine shall blush as guilty of my sin.

   Then shall I live, being rescued in my fall. A text of mercy to Your
   creatures all

   Who having seen the worst of sins in me, Must needs confess, the best
   of love's in Thee." Does not this writer dip his pen into your soul's
   sorrows?

   III. Spare me a minute or two while I dwell on the head of MYSTERY
   SOLVED. "I sleep, but my heart is awake." Why is her heart awake? It is
   because the voice and knock of her Beloved are heard. Every child of
   God has a wondrous union with Christ. "Because I live," says Christ,
   "you shall live also." Ask why you are alive in such a body of death
   and grave of sin as your poor nature is? You live because Christ lives
   and you cannot die till He does! This is why you cannot sleep as do
   others, because He does not sleep. "He that keeps Israel shall neither
   slumber nor sleep," and till Christ's spiritual life shall

   altogether slumber out into forgetfulness and inaction yours never
   shall. The mystic union between yourselves and Jesus secures you from
   destruction which, apart from Him, would sweep you away as with a
   brook.

   This is why, dear Friends, when you get where you should not be, you
   cannot be happy because Jesus is not happy when you are there! He
   groans over your follies. They cost Him wounds and bloody sweat and
   death and they must cost you something, too, if you indulge in them.
   That field all tangled with the brambles tore the Shepherd when He
   sought you out and the briars will tear you, also, if you wander there.
   The reason why you are awake at all is because Jesus calls you. His
   voice rings in your ears through His Word both heard and read. He more
   than calls--He knocks at your heart by affliction, by mercy, by
   warning, by comfort. He will do more with you, yet, if you are His--He
   will put in His hand by the hole of the door and then you shall open to
   Him and He will come and sup with you and you with Him.

   The mystery is all solved, the saint would be a sinner if it were not
   that he is one with the sinner's Savior--the living Believer would be a
   lump of death and corruption if it were not that he is one with Him who
   is the Resurrection and the Life who has said, "Whoever believes in Me
   shall never die." And again, "Though he were dead yet shall he live."
   What a blessing is this vital union with the ever-blessed Head,
   immortal and unslumbering!

   IV. Now for THE LESSON LEARNED. It is this--be very careful when you
   possess great joys, for in this instance the spouse had been with the
   Beloved in choice fellowship and yet was soon drowsy. He had given her
   to drink abundantly and He had feasted with her, but no sooner had the
   sun set than she said, "I sleep." We are amazing creatures. Our very
   perfect brethren, although they do not see it, generally exhibit some
   glaring imperfection if you let them talk for five minutes. If you
   knock at the door to see if Mr. Pride is at home, you need not praise
   him long before he will show his full-length portrait. We are thankful
   for these brethren so far as they are saints, for good people are
   scarce--but I wish they would not tell us so much about their
   saintliness, for I have noticed that great cry often goes with little
   wool and the noisiest thing that goes down the street is the dust cart.

   He who makes most noise about his own perfection has the least of it!
   Let us be careful whenever we rise to the summit of the hill--careful
   to stay up, careful that we so act when we are up that we do not come
   down with a run. Whenever the Lord visits you, entertain Him right
   heartily. Be careful that nothing grieves Him, lest He depart. High
   joys may produce slumber--the chosen three upon the Mount Tabor were
   soon overcome with heaviness. At the too-transporting sight of the
   transfigured Savior, darkness covered them! Mind what you do when on
   the mountain! Be careful to carry a full cup with a steady hand.

   Next, when you are blaming yourselves for your own work, do not forget
   the work of the Spirit in you. "I sleep"-- smite your heart for that,
   but do not forget to add, if it is true, "My heart is awake." Bless God
   for any Grace you have, even if it is but little. What if I am not
   sanctified as I wish to be and shall be, yet I am perfectly justified!
   What if I do not exhibit my Father's likeness so completely as I hope
   to do, yet I am His child! What if, as yet, I do not produce all the
   fruits of the Spirit, yet I have the germs of them, the buds and
   blossoms--and soon I shall have the ripe fruit! In Aaron's rod we see
   that the same power that could put the buds and blossoms on a dry stick
   could put the almonds there, too!

   Lastly, make sure, above all things, that you have that true faith
   which knows the voice of Jesus. The spouse had not awaked if it had not
   been for the charm of Jesus' voice which affected even her drowsy
   faculties. Some persons can be more easily awakened by the voices of
   those they love than by any other means. The charm of memory, the charm
   of intimate affection, the charm of delight gives music to some
   tongues--let your ears find all its music in the voice of Jesus! Know
   His voice. He says, "Incline your ears and come unto Me: hear and your
   soul shall live. My sheep hear My voice and I know them and they follow
   Me and I give them eternal life."

   God bless you, dear Friends, with a faith that trusts Jesus, knows His
   voice and follows Him! And may we be awakened out of all our
   sleepiness, if we are at all drowsy, into a holy wakefulness so as to
   serve the Lord our God with all our heart and soul and strength while
   we live. Come, Holy Spirit and give us this privilege, for Jesus' sake!
   Amen.

Harvest Past, Summer Ended and Men Unsaved

   (No. 1562)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, OCTOBER 17, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The harvest is past, the summer is ended and we are not saved."
   Jeremiah 8:20.

   THIS is a very mournful chapter, especially if we include in it, as we
   rightly should, the first verse of the ninth chapter: "O that my head
   were waters." The passage is full of lamentation and woe and yet it is
   somewhat amazing that the chief mourner is not one who was likely to be
   in trouble. Jeremiah was under the special protection of God and he
   escaped in the evil day. Even when Nebuchadnezzar was exercising his
   utmost rage, Jeremiah was in no danger, for the heart of the fierce
   monarch was kindly towards him. "Now Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,
   gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzar-adan the captain of the
   guard, saying, take him and look well to him and do him no harm; but do
   unto him even as he shall say unto you."

   The man of God who had least cause, personally, to mourn, was filled
   with heavy grief--while the people who were about to lose their all and
   to lose their lives, remained but half awakened--complaining, but not
   repenting--afraid, but not yet humbled before God. None of them uttered
   such a grievous lament as that which came from the heart and mouth of
   the Prophet. Their heads were full of idle dreams, while his had become
   waters. Their eyes were full of wantonness, while his were a fountain
   of tears. He loved them better than they loved themselves. Is it not
   strange that it should be so--that the physician should be more anxious
   than the sick?

   Perhaps, however, it is not so amazing that the shepherd should care
   more for the flock than the sheep care for themselves. When the sheep
   are men, it is certainly an unreasonable thing! The weeping Prophet
   cries, "For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt!" He was
   more hurt than they were. A preacher whom God sends will often feel
   more care for the souls of men than men feel for themselves or their
   own salvation. Is it not sad that there should be an anxious pain in
   the heart of one who is himself saved, while those who are unsaved and
   are obliged to acknowledge it, feel little or no concern? To see a man
   in jeopardy of his life and all around him alarmed for his danger while
   he, himself, is half asleep, is a sad sight.

   See yonder man, about to be condemned to die, standing at the bar? The
   judge putting on the black cap is scarcely able to pronounce the
   sentence for emotion and all around him in the court break down with
   distress on his account-- while the condemned is bronze-faced and feels
   no more than the floor he stands upon! How hardened he has become! Pity
   is lost upon him, if pity ever can be lost. Such a sad sight we
   constantly see in our congregations--those who are "condemned already"
   on account of sin are altogether indifferent to their awful
   peril--while their godly parents are greatly distressed for them!
   Christian people are pleading with them and earnest messengers from God
   expostulating with them! Heaven and earth are moved for them and yet
   they are unaffected!

   Oh that it might not be so here this morning! May none of you be
   hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. May God in His infinite
   mercy strike the rock and make the waters of penitence to gush out from
   it! May His transforming hand turn stone into flesh and cause a holy
   tenderness to banish all stubbornness and insensibility! Such is my
   agonizing cry to the Holy Spirit. Certainly there ought to be dismay
   and even terror in the heart of any who are compelled to use my text in
   reference to themselves. Those few words, "We are not saved!" sound
   like a peal of thunder! They should cut the soul as with a case of
   knives--"We are not saved!" What worse thing can men say of themselves?
   We are now under the abiding wrath of God, for "we are not saved!"

   We must soon stand before the Judgment Seat of God and then we shall be
   condemned by the great Judge, for "we are not saved!" We shall, before
   long, be driven from His Presence and from the glory of His power, for
   "we are not saved!" We shall then be shut out in outer darkness where
   there shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, for "we are
   not saved!" Had men but reason, or having reason would they but use it
   upon the most important of all subjects,

   surely they would cry out in the bitterness of their souls, "Oh that
   our heads were water and our eyes fountains of tears, that we might
   weep day and night till we had found our Savior and He had washed away
   our sins and saved us!" How saddening to see the loaded wagons of
   harvest bearing no real blessing to us and to watch the clusters on the
   vine ripen all unblessed! Alas for that summer which amid all its
   flowers yields us no perfume of peace or joy!

   On the other hand, my Brothers and Sisters, how blessed to feel that
   the harvest is past and the summer is ended and, blessed be God, we are
   saved! Now let winter come with all its blasts--we have nothing to
   fear--for wrapped in our Savior's righteousness and hidden in the cleft
   of His side, we shall outlive every storm! I earnestly pray the Lord to
   bless the words I am about to speak, that they may be rendered useful
   to many undecided persons to lead them to decision and induce them to
   give themselves up to Christ at once. May the Holy Spirit work this
   blessed result in thousands! I have so long been silent that I am
   hungering to speak with power. Come Holy Spirit! Come!

   First, I shall look at the text as a complaint--"We are not saved."
   And, secondly, I shall suggest that out of it ought to come
   consideration--those who utter the complaint should be led, thereby, to
   solemn consideration.

   I. First, we have before us the language of COMPLAINT. These Jews said,
   "The seasons are going by, the year is spending itself, the harvest is
   past, the vintage, also, is ended and yet we are not saved." Some of
   them were captives in Babylon and they fondly expected to be brought
   back from the distant land, but they were disappointed. They hoped that
   when the produce of the Nile had been reaped, Egyptian troops would
   march against Nebuchadnezzar and break his power. Others of them had
   fled into the defended cities and taken refuge behind the walls of
   Jerusalem and they, also, dreamed that the march of the Chaldeans would
   be stopped and the land would be delivered from their invasion as soon
   as the summer heat was over. The rescue did not come.

   Indeed, they could hear from Jerusalem the neighing of the Babylonian
   horses--"The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land
   trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are
   come and have devoured the land and all that is in it; the city and
   those that dwell therein." Therefore they complained that their hopes
   had failed. In effect they complained of God--that He had not saved
   them--as if He was under some obligation to have done so! They
   complained as if they had a kind of claim upon Him to interpose and so
   they spoke as if they were an ill-used people, a nation that had been
   neglected by their Protector. The farmers had gathered in the harvest
   and vinedressers had gleaned the grapes, yet they had not been cared
   for, but left to suffer--in spite of all their hopes, they were not
   saved.

   Certain persons fall into the same state of mind in these days. They
   know that they are not saved, but they do not blame themselves for it!
   The fault lies--they would not like to say where it lies--but they will
   not admit that it lies in themselves. They are not saved and somebody
   should be blamed for it, or perhaps nobody, but they mention the fact,
   not as a confession of which they are ashamed, but as a misfortune for
   which they are to be pitied! This complaint was a very unjust one of
   the Jews, for there were many reasons why they were not saved and why
   God had not delivered them. The first was they had looked to the wrong
   quarter--they expected that the Egyptians would deliver them.

   You remember that in the reign of Zedekiah the Jews revolted from their
   subjection to the Babylonians because they hoped that the king of Egypt
   would come up and fight with the Babylonian power. Those who were
   captives hoped that the great armies of the Pharaohs might break down
   the might of Chaldea and so they looked to Egypt for help--an old fault
   with Israel and a gross folly--for why should they look to the house of
   bondage for succor? The same folly dwells in multitudes of men. They
   are not saved and they never will be while they continue to look where
   they look! All dependence upon ourselves is looking to Egypt for help
   and leaning our weight upon a broken reed.

   Whether that dependence upon self takes the form of relying upon
   ceremonies, or depending upon prayers, or trusting in our own attempts
   to improve ourselves morally, it is still the same proud folly of
   self-dependence. Vain is all searching for legal righteousness, hoping
   to merit something from God, or to do something without help from on
   high--for the Lord, Himself, has assured us that by the works of the
   Law no flesh shall be justified! My Friend, you may have been very
   earnest and serious about Divine things, but if you have looked, in any
   measure or degree, to what you are, or can do, or what any man can do
   for you, it is no wonder that you are not saved, for there is no
   salvation except in

   Christ!

   I am afraid some think that it is a great thing to sit under a faithful
   minister--that if the Gospel is thoroughly preached they may,
   naturally, expect that if they take a seat at the place they will be
   saved. But all dependence upon min-

   isters is only another form of superstitious confidence in priestcraft!
   All trust but that which is found in Jesus is a delusion and a
   falsehood! No man can help you. Though Noah, Samuel and Moses prayed
   for you, their prayers could not avail unless you believed in the blood
   of Jesus--there is salvation nowhere else! Though the whole Church were
   to unite in one protracted intercession and determine that all its
   ministers should preach to only you for the next seven years, there
   would be no more hope of your being saved, then, than now, unless you
   would believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, who alone is the salvation of
   the sons of men.

   The most fruitful of harvests may pass and the most genial of summers
   may smile upon you, but while you look to yourself, no sunshine from
   God shall cause you to flourish. Eternal barrenness is the portion of
   those who trust in man and make flesh their arm. While men go about to
   establish their own righteousness and will not submit themselves to the
   righteousness of Christ, they shall be like the woman who spent all her
   living upon physicians and was no better, but rather grew worse. Those
   people had prided themselves upon their outward privileges--they had
   presumed upon their favored position, for they say in the 19th verse,
   "Is not the Lord in Zion? Is not her king in her?" Because they
   belonged to the chosen nation; because the Lord had entrusted them with
   the sacred Oracles and manifested Himself to their fathers, therefore
   they thought that they might sin with impunity and reckoned upon being
   delivered in the day of danger.

   I do not know how many of you, here, may be depending upon outward
   religiousness, or indulging some kind of thought that apart from your
   personal faith in Christ, you will be saved by your pious connections
   and hallowed relationships. But if that is what you are depending upon,
   rest assured you will be deceived! Vain are the baptism or the
   confirmation of your youth--faith in Jesus is the one thing necessary!
   Vain is the fact that you were born of Christian par-ents--you must be
   born again! Vain is your sitting as God's people sit and standing as
   they stand in the solemn service of the sanctuary--your heart must be
   changed! Vain is your observance of the Lord's Day and vain your Bible
   reading and your form of night and morning prayer unless you are washed
   in Jesus' blood! Vain are all things without living faith in the living
   Jesus!

   Though you had been descended from an unbroken line of saints; though
   you had no unconverted relatives, your ancestry and lineage would not
   do you any good--the sons of God are born, not of blood, nor of the
   will of man, nor of the will of the flesh, but of God. All the external
   privileges that can be heaped upon you, though you had sermons piled up
   and Gospel services heaped on them--as the giants piled mountain upon
   mountain, Pelion upon Ossa that they might climb to Heaven, would be
   useless--there is no reaching to salvation by such means. If your
   reliance is upon external ordinances, or professions, or privileges in
   any measure or degree--no wonder that the harvest is past and the
   summer is ended and you are not saved--you will never be saved till
   doomsday while you look in that direction. Look like sinners to your
   Savior and you shall be saved, but no other way.

   Thirdly, there was another and very powerful reason why these people
   were not saved, for, with all their religiousness and their national
   boast as to God's being among them, they had continued in provoking the
   Lord. He says in the 19th verse, "Why have they provoked Me to anger
   with their graven images and with strange vanities?" They lived in sin,
   disobeying God to His face! They set up new idols and imported false
   deities from foreign lands and yet they said, "We are not saved." Would
   they have the Lord sanction their degrading idolatry by sending them
   deliverance? Do you know a man who goes frequently into ill company and
   gets intoxicated and yet comes to hear the Gospel and murmurs that he
   is not saved? Is he not mad? Let me speak plainly to him. Do you think
   that you are going to Heaven to reel about the holy streets? Shall the
   pure heavens be polluted by your profanities? You are dreadfully
   mistaken if you fancy so!

   Another person indulges lust, lives an unclean life and yet he comes in
   and listens to the Word of God as one who has a loving ear for it and
   he, also, complains that he is not saved. O unclean man, how can you
   dream of salvation while you are defiled with filthiness? What? You and
   your harlot, members of Christ! Oh, Sir, you know not my pure and holy
   Master! He receives sinners, but He rejects those who delight in their
   iniquities. You must have done with the indulgence of sin if you would
   be cleansed from the guilt of it! There is no going on in transgression
   and yet obtaining salvation--it is a licentious supposition! Christ
   comes to save us from our sins, not to make it safe to do evil! That
   blood which washes out the stain brings with it a hatred of the thing
   which made the stain! Sin must be relinquished or salvation cannot be
   received.

   I spoke very plainly, just now, but some here of pure heart little know
   how plainly we must speak if we are to reach some men's consciences,
   for it shames me when I think of some who, year after year, indulge in
   secret sin and yet they are

   regular frequenters of the House of God. You would think they surely
   were already converted, or soon would be, when you saw them here. But
   if you followed them home, you would quite despair of them. O lovers of
   sin, do not deceive yourselves! You will surely reap that which you
   sow! How can Grace reign in you while you are the slaves of your own
   passions? How can it be, while you are anchored to a secret sin, that
   you should be borne along by the current of Grace towards the desired
   haven of safety? Either you must leave your sin or leave all hope of
   Heaven!

   If you hold your sin, Hell will, before long, hold you! Jesus was not
   sent to be the minister of sin! He never came into the world to bleed
   and die to make the way of the transgressors easy by enabling them to
   be vicious without risk. The Friend of sinners is the Enemy of sin!
   There is a religion that will let you pay a shilling or two and
   purchase priestly absolution, but this we protest against. Such a faith
   may well breed iniquity! What can it be but like Egypt's Nile, when in
   the days of Moses it became the fruitful mother of 10,000 unclean
   frogs? Under the religion of Christ, absolution for the past is only to
   be obtained through faith in Jesus--and that faith brings with it
   repentance for former offenses and a change of life for days to come.
   Why do men say, "We are not saved," when they are still hugging their
   iniquities? They may as well hope to gather grapes from thorns or figs
   from thistles as to find salvation while they abide in sin! May God
   deliver us all from the love of sin, for such a deliverance is
   salvation.

   Again, there was another reason why they were not saved and that was
   because they made being saved from trouble the principal matter. Many
   make a great mistake about salvation. They mistake the meaning of the
   term and to them, salvation means being delivered from going down into
   the pit of Hell--just as to these Jews it meant rescue from
   Nebuchadnezzar. Now, the right meaning of salvation is purification
   from evil. These people never thought of this. They never said, "We are
   not cleansed, we are not made holy," but, "we are not saved." If their
   cry had been, "The harvest is past, the summer is ended and we have not
   yet conquered sin," that would have been a mark of something good and
   true. But they showed no trace of it. There is not much in a man's
   desiring to be saved if he means by that, an escape from the punishment
   of his offenses!

   Was there ever a murderer who did not wish to be saved from the
   gallows? When a man is tied up to be flogged for a deed of brutal
   violence and his back is bared for the lash, depend upon it, he repents
   of what he did--that is to say, he repents that he has to suffer for
   it--but that is all and a sorry all, too. He has no sorrow for the
   agony which he inflicted on his innocent victim. He has no regret for
   maiming him for life. What is the value of such a repentance? Here is
   the point, my Hearers--do you wish to have new hearts? If you do, you
   shall have them! Do you wish to leave the sins you have loved? Do you
   desire to live as Christ lived? Do you wish to keep the Commandments of
   God? Do you sigh for purity of life? Do you wish, from now on, to be as
   God would have you be--just, loving, kind, chaste--after the example of
   the great Redeemer? If so, then truly the desire you have comes from
   God!

   But if all you want is to be able to die without dread that you may
   wake up in the next world and not be driven down to the bottomless
   Pit--if that is all--there is nothing gracious in it and it is no
   wonder that you should say, "The harvest is past, the summer is ended
   and I am not saved." You do not know what being saved means! May God
   teach you to love holiness and there shall not pass another harvest,
   no, not another day before you shall be saved! Indeed, that very love
   is the dawn of salvation! Seek salvation as the kingdom of God within
   you. Seek it first and seek it now and you shall not be denied.

   Again, there was another reason why these people were not saved and
   could not be. Read the ninth verse and see their fault and folly--"Lo,
   they have rejected the Word of the Lord and what wisdom is in them?" We
   hear persons complain that they are not saved though they neglect the
   saving Word of God. They go to a place of worship and, therefore,
   wonder that they are not saved--how can they be when that which they
   hear is not the object of their heart's attention? Do you read your
   Bible privately? Did you ever read it with an earnest prayer that God
   would teach you what you really are and make you to be a true believer
   in Christ? Have you done that just as earnestly as you studied a book
   when you were trying to pass an examination?

   I do not know what calling you follow, but I will suppose, for
   instance, that you wish to be a chemist. If so, you go through a course
   of studies and you acquaint yourself with certain books in order that
   you may pass an examination. You stick to your work, for you know that
   you will not pass unless you are well informed as to the matters
   necessary to your profession. Do you show the same diligence in
   reference to your soul and your God? Have you ever read your Bible with
   anything like the same intensity with which a man must study a class
   book in order to pass his examinations? Have

   you read it with regard to yourself, asking God to teach you its
   meaning and to make the sense of it press upon your conscience? Do you
   reply, "I have not done that"? Why, then, do you wonder that you are
   not saved?

   To put a slighter test than the former--when you hear the Gospel, do
   you always inquire--"What has this to do with me?" Or do you listen to
   it as a general Truth of God with which you have no peculiar concern?
   What a difference is perceptible in hearers! Numbers of persons have
   come here at this time merely to hear Spurgeon preach and form an
   estimate of him. Is this a fit errand for God's Day and for an assembly
   gathered for worship? Do not imagine that we are flattered by such
   attention! We do not covet such hearers! What do I care about their
   estimate? A poor soul that desires to find Christ is a diamond in my
   eyes, but he who comes to hear me because of public talk is a common
   pebble that one might sling away--only it is well that even he should
   hear the Word of God if, perhaps, God might bless him.

   Many of you Christian people hear sermons that you may
   remember--well-turned sentences and pithy sayings--or that you may
   gauge the preacher's earnestness and judge whether he is likely to be
   useful. Hearing for others is a very common amusement. There is a great
   deal of difference between walking through a baker's shop when you are
   well-filled and counting the loaves upon the shelves and rushing in the
   door to get a bit of bread at once, for fear of dying of starvation!
   Water seen as a picturesque object by a traveler is one thing, but a
   living draught swallowed by one dying of thirst is quite a different
   matter. O that men would treat the Gospel as a necessity of life which
   they must, each one, feed upon or perish! That is the style of hearing
   when a man prays that the Word of God may search him and try him!

   It is well when the hearer bares his bosom and cries, "Lord, cut this
   cancer out of my soul, I pray You. I beseech You, let me live!" That
   kind of hearing ends in saving. "Incline your ears," says the great
   Lord, "and come unto Me; hear and your soul shall live." "Hearken
   diligently unto Me," He says, again and, in so doing, He certifies that
   diligent listening shall bring a blessing with it. Alas, with the bulk
   of hearers, even the Word of God goes in one ear and out the other! The
   noise of God's voice is drowned by the din of the world's traffic. The
   six days crush the influence of the seventh and it is no wonder that
   January comes and December goes and yet worldlings are not saved! They
   never will be while they slumber as they do.

   There is another reason why some men are not saved and that is because
   they have a great preference for slight measures. They love to hear the
   flattering voice whispering--"Peace, peace," where there is no peace
   and they choose those for leaders who will heal their hurt with the
   least pain. They wish for something very comfortable and, in their
   folly, they prefer poisoned sweets to healthful salts. "I felt so
   miserable," said one, "when I left that place, that I said I would
   never enter it again." It was a foolish vow. He who is wise will go
   where the Word of God has the most power--both to kill and to make
   alive. Do you want a physician, when you call upon him, to please you
   with a flattering opinion? Must he say, "My dear Friend, it is a very
   small matter--you need nothing but pleasant diet and you will soon be
   all right"?

   If he talks thus, smoothly, when he knows that a deadly disease is
   commencing its work upon you, is he not a deceiver? Do you not think
   you are very foolish if you pay such a man your guinea and denounce his
   neighbor who tells you the plain truth? Do you want to be deluded? Are
   you eager to be duped? Do you want to dream of Heaven and then wake up
   in Hell? Have I such an idiot here? May Heaven save him from his
   ruinous folly! For my part, I would like to know the worst of my case!
   Things must be very bad with any of you who cannot say the same. When a
   merchant dares not face his books, you know where he is! When he says
   to his clerk, "No, no, I do not want to know on which side the balance
   stands! I cannot bear to be worried. I dare say money will come in as
   well as go out and my credit will raise me another loan. Things will
   come round and the less we dive into difficulties the better."

   I think we shall hear of that gentleman very speedily in the Bankruptcy
   Court. He is in the same condition, spiritually, who does not dare to
   face himself, but would rather not be troubled with questions and
   examinations. What? Do you dare not look yourself in the face? Have you
   covered up the mirror? Have you hid the Word of God from yourselves and
   dare not see how you look? Yes? Then be sure you are in an evil plight!
   While men will not have the thorough-going Truth of God preached to
   them. While they prefer some siren strain. While they would gladly
   listen to soft music and float upon gentle streams that bear them down
   to destruction, there is little hope but what harvests and summers will
   come and go and they will not be saved! All this while these people
   have wondered that they were not saved and yet they never repented of
   their sins!

   The Lord Himself witnesses against them--"I hearkened and heard, but
   they spoke not aright: no man repented of his wickedness, saying, What
   have I done? Everyone turned to his course, as the horse rushes into
   battle." "Were they

   ashamed when they had committed abomination? No, they were not at all
   ashamed, neither could they blush." Repentance was a jest with
   them--they had not Grace enough, even, to feel shame and yet they made
   a complaint against God, saying, "The harvest is past, the summer is
   ended and we are not saved." What monstrous folly was this! Where has
   the Lord given half a promise to those who will not confess and forsake
   their sins? How can impenitent sinners hope that they should be
   forgiven? We have said enough upon this unjustifiable complaint!

   II. Now, may the Spirit of God help us while we try to lead unconverted
   persons, for a few minutes, into the CONSIDERATION of this matter.
   First consideration, "we are not saved." I do not want to talk, I want
   you to think. "We are not saved." Put it in the personal, first person
   singular. Will everyone here do me the favor of saying to himself if it
   is true, "I am not saved! I am not saved! I am not saved from sin, I
   love it still! I am not saved from guilt, I am condemned for my failure
   to keep the Law of God. I am not saved from wrath, I am not saved from
   judgment, I am not saved from the eternal curse. I am not saved! My
   dear child in Heaven is forever happy, but I am not saved.

   "My dear wife is a happy Christian, but I am not saved. I am one of a
   family where many have been converted, but I am not saved! I am a
   gray-headed old man and I am not saved. I am beloved in my family by my
   dear mother, for I am yet a child, but though she prays for me I am not
   saved. I am a member of a Church and am not saved." Are you obliged to
   say that, any of you? Be honest! Do not cover up the truth, however
   terrible it may be--better far to face it. What if someone must
   confess, "I am a preacher of the Gospel, but I am not saved"? Oh, my
   Heart, what terror is here! It is an awful thing if anybody here has to
   say, "I am a teacher in a Sunday school and this afternoon the little
   ones will gather round me, but I am not saved. People respect me. They
   say I have all things good about me, but I have not the one thing
   necessary, I am not saved."

   Teachers, does this touch any of you? I pray you, let it have its due
   influence. Now you down here in this area and you in these galleries,
   will you do one of two things? Either say, "By God's Grace I have
   believed in Jesus and I am saved," or else just sigh out silently in
   your soul, "I am not saved." It will do you good to end all questions
   and know, once and for all, whether you are in Christ or not.
   Furthermore, not only am I not saved, but I have been a long time not
   saved. Let me put language into the mouths of those who are ruining
   themselves by delay. "Time flies. How quickly it is gone! I was a young
   man a very little while ago. Now I am getting into middle age, getting
   a little bald, gray hairs are upon me here and there. Why, dear me,
   here are grandchildren--it seems but yesterday that I was married! Yes,
   harvests have passed, vintages have been gathered and I am not saved.

   "Twenty years ago I sat listening to this same preacher and I was not
   saved then. And I remember how he touched my conscience, but all those
   years have gone and I am not saved! The world has had its opportunities
   and used them--they sowed and they reaped their harvests. The
   vinedresser used the knife and the vine was pruned and in due season he
   gathered the clusters, but I have had no harvest--I have known no
   vintage. I have made money. I have got on in business, or at least I
   have paid my way and supported my family, but I have had no spiritual
   harvest. No, for I never sowed. I have had no spiritual vintage, for I
   was never pruned. I never went to the great Farmer and asked Him to dig
   about me and make me fruitful to His name. What opportunities I had! I
   have been through revivals, but the sacred power passed over me. I
   remember several wonderful occasions when the Spirit of God was poured
   out and yet I am not saved."

   Worse, still, habits harden. "If I was not saved during the last 20 or
   30 years I am less likely to be impressed now. I do not feel as I once
   did. Sometimes the vile unbelief which now taints the very air creeps
   over me and I am half a skeptic. Considerations that used to thrill me
   and make my flesh creep are now put before me, but I seem like a piece
   of steel--no, I do not even rust under the Word of God--I am
   unimpressible. Harvests have dried me, summers have parched me, age has
   shriveled my soul--my moisture is turned into the drought of summer--I
   am getting to be old hay, or as withered weeds fit for the burning."

   It is a dreadful consideration for a man to turn over in his mind, but
   it is a very necessary one, for it is an undoubted fact that every year
   fixes the character and engraves the lines of evil deeper in the
   nature. Harvests and summers leave us worse if they do not see us mend.
   As true as you are alive, unless the God of Infinite Mercy awakens you
   out of your present condition to seek and immediately find Christ and
   obtain everlasting life, some of you will settle down into a condition
   which will be the eternal state of your hearts! O for Grace to repent
   at once, before yet the wax has cooled and the seal is set forever! The
   last summer will soon come and the last harvest will soon be reaped and
   you, dear Friend, must go to your last and final home.

   I will apply it mainly to myself--I must go upstairs for the last time
   and I must lay down upon the bed from which I shall never rise again!
   If I am unsaved, my room will be a prison chamber to me and the bed
   will be hard as a plank. If, unsaved, I have to lie there and know that
   I must die--that a few more days or hours must end this struggle for
   existence and I am bound to stand before God--O my God, save me from an
   unready deathbed! Save these people from dying and passing into Hell!
   You will have no doubts about it then, you know. You will see clearly
   that you are bound to stand before God. This naked spirit of mine,
   disrobed of its body, must appear before the Judge! What shall I do?
   What shall I say? Before my Maker's burning eyes--stripped naked to my
   shame--what shall I do? And when I, speechless, stand before Him--by my
   silence acknowledging my guilt--what shall I do?

   The gate of Heaven is shut, I cannot enter there! I have not the
   password. I have rejected the way there. I have rejected Christ, who is
   the King of the place. Oh where must I go? I will not paint the
   picture. Souls, I charge you by everything that is rational within you,
   escape for your lives and seek to find eternal salvation for your
   undying spirits! You are not dogs nor cats, nor horses nor cattle as
   men tell you! You are nobler things and an immortality awaits you! And
   today you shall make that immortality the most awful curse that can
   fall upon you, or an infinite, unutterable privilege! It is a grand
   alternative! God help us, by His infinite mercy, to choose eternal
   holiness and everlasting joy and choose it now! Come, let us consider a
   little longer, a few practical Truths of God which may be of service.

   It is quite clear that if you are to get right, you must not go on in
   the old way. The harvest is past and the summer is ended and, by the
   way in which you have been going you are not saved. There must be a
   change of tactics. Salvation must be thought of in another light and
   sought for in another spirit. Come, my Friend, if you are to find
   salvation, you must be more earnest about it! You must be more intense
   about it! There must be a greater valuing of this salvation and a more
   solemn resolve that if Heaven or earth or Hell can yield it to you, you
   will have it, for, "the kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the
   violent take it by force." Never did a man sleep himself into eternal
   life! Salvation is all of Grace, but sluggards have no Grace! The Lord
   does not work in us to sleep and to slumber, but to will and to do. Men
   reach the Celestial City, not by drowsiness, but by their spirits being
   stirred to feel that there is nothing else that is worth a thought
   compared with going on pilgrimage to Heaven!

   There is one thing certain, that, as the harvests have past and the
   summer is ended and we have not been saved, we must have been looking
   in the wrong place. Very likely we have been looking to something on
   earth for salvation. If so, we have not found it because it is not
   there! The Prophet enquires--"Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no
   physician there?" He knew that there was none in that region which
   could meet his people's dreadful hurt. There was a balm in Gilead, but
   it was the resin of a tree. There were physicians there, but they were
   mostly quacks that duped the people! If there had been any true balm
   and any real physician there, the health of the daughter of his people
   would have been recovered. No, my Hearer, there is no balm in Gilead
   for you! The balm of Gilead was only good for certain bodily wounds and
   sores, but not for cuts and wounds and sores like these, for these are
   in the soul! The physicians of Gilead could only heal some few
   complaints and seldom enough did they heal even these, but all the
   physicians of Gilead in a row cannot heal your complaint! I will tell
   you of another and better health resort than Gilead--it is Calvary.
   Where Jesus bled you will find a balm! Where Jesus lives you will find
   a Physician!

   Another thing must have suggested itself to you while I have been
   preaching, dear Friend, if you have listened in earnest and it is
   this--the great point must be that if I am to be saved I must get rid
   of sin. I will again speak for those whom I address. "I have been
   thinking that I should undergo some strange transformation and some
   kind of mysterious shock, or have a vision or see some strange sight
   and then I could say I am a converted man. This morning I discover that
   the main point is to get rid of sin--it must be driven out of my heart.
   I have not only to leave off the act of it and the thought of it, but
   all love to it must go. I cannot be a saved man unless that is the
   case."

   If you have kept pace with the preacher so far, I think the next
   thought will come--"Then this is deep water! This is a place where my
   own strength utterly fails me! If I must have a new heart--well, I
   cannot make myself a new heart. If the very love of sin has to go, I
   cannot accomplish that! I can stop outside the theater, but I cannot
   prevent my desiring to go in. I can renounce dishonesty, but I cannot
   help having an itching palm. Even if I dare not transgress, yet I may
   feel the wish to do so if the punishment could be escaped. This makes
   the matter too hard for unaided nature since it is true that unless the
   love of sin is gone, nothing is done. God must help me or this will
   never be accomplished!"

   This is the center of the truth! Your great Creator must come and make
   you over again. His dear Son must come and end your captivity to the
   power of evil. He has come! He has died! Nothing can ever take out the
   stains of your past sin but the blood of the Son of God! Nothing can
   take from you the love of sin but the application of the atoning blood
   and the work of the Spirit upon your entire nature, creating you anew
   in Christ Jesus. "Oh," says one, "I see it all now. I seem to have come
   up against a rock wall and I can go no further. I wonder not that the
   summers have gone and the harvests have ended when it is like this, for
   now I am brought up before a dread impossibility. What can I do?"

   You can do this, God helping you--trust Christ to do it all! Throw
   yourself down at His feet. "Savior, Savior, from the highest Heaven
   look down, here is a sinner in his blood. I read of others, that when
   they were in their blood, You said to them, Live! Say that to me! Here
   is one condemned and near to die. Save him! Forgive him! Impute Your
   righteousness, make me to be accepted in the Beloved. I trust You!" Do
   you, indeed, trust Jesus? Is it true that you believe on Him? Then you
   are saved! His merit is yours! His blood has cleansed you the moment
   you believe in Him! It is done--you shall not love sin again.

   You shall be tempted and often have to groan because of secret lusts
   that will linger in you, but you have a new life, now, for you have
   believed in Jesus and that new life will abhor sin and will fight it!
   That new life will conquer it and God will help you! And the Spirit
   will dwell in you and you shall get sin more and more under your
   feet--yes, you shall bruise Satan under your feet, before long--and you
   shall triumph and one day you shall burst this shell which holds you in
   and you shall shine, in the image of Christ, "without spot or wrinkle,
   or any such thing." Yes, you, sinful man, shall be made perfectly holy,
   even you, now full of iniquity, transgression and sin!

   You are a God-provoking rebel this morning, but if you trust in Christ
   Jesus you shall be washed and made God-pleasing this very day! You are
   black as Hell today, but you shall, by infinite mercy, be made as
   bright as a seraph before God and all because you trust the Savior! O
   God, grant us Your saving Grace for Jesus' sake! Amen.

The Duty of the Present Hour

   (No. 1563)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the Lord, till He
   comes and rains righteousness upon you." Hosea 10:12.

   "BREAK up your fallow ground." Nature at its largest is but a small
   farm and we had need to get a harvest out of every acre of it, for our
   needs are great. Have we left any part of our small allotment
   uncultivated? If so, it is time to look into the matter and see if we
   cannot improve this wasteful state of things. What part of our small
   allotment have we left fallow? We should think very poorly of a farmer
   who, for many years, allowed the best and the richest part of his farm
   to lie altogether neglected and untilled. An occasional fallow has its
   benefits in the world of Nature, but if the proprietor of rich and
   fruitful land allowed the soil to continue fallow year after year, we
   would judge him to be out of his wits! The wasted acres ought to be
   taken from him and given to another farmer who would worthily cherish
   the generous fields and encourage them to yield their harvests. Bad is
   the man who neglects to cultivate his farm, but what shall be said of
   the sluggard who fails to cultivate himself. If it is wrong to leave
   untended a part of our estate, how much worse must it be to disregard a
   portion of ourselves!

   Now, there is a part of our nature which many allow to lie fallow. It
   is not often that they neglect the clay soil of their outward frame.
   They dress that field, which is called the body, with sufficient care
   and, truly, I would not that they should be careless about it, for it
   is worthy to be kept in due order and culture. Albeit that it is a very
   secondary part of our nature, yet it is so interwoven with the higher
   that it is most important that the body should not be neglected. See
   you well to that field and, by temperance, cleanliness and obedience to
   the rules of health, let it be as a garden. Though it is, after all,
   but dust and ashes, akin to the common earth around us, yet the body is
   honorable and when Divine Grace has sanctified the soul the body
   becomes the temple of the Holy Spirit.

   Few need to be exhorted to pay attention to their bodies. "What shall
   we eat? What shall we drink and how shall we be clothed?" is a trinity
   of questions which the majority of mankind spend all their lives in
   answering. The fault is not that they care for the body, but that it
   takes an undue share of consideration and usurps a higher place than it
   can claim. There is a second field in man's self-farm and this is
   called the mind, or the soul, and there are many who neglect this.
   These do ill, for, "that the soul is without knowledge, it is not
   good." There should be, for the mental powers, instruction and
   discipline. We should seek to know and learn to understand, for we are
   not as the brutes which perish, which know nothing beyond their daily
   needs. We have thought and judgment and memory and imagination--these
   all need to be trained and used.

   Let the mind be cultivated, by all means, and yet I need not say much
   upon this, for "culture" has become a kind of watchword with certain
   professors of religion and with supposed knowledge they are puffed up.
   They have enough thought for the mind and they glory in the harvests
   which it yields of human knowledge and earthly learning. The soul, in
   such cases, seems to be well tilled, but the spirit, the highest nature
   of all--that with which we speak to God--is suffered to lie entirely
   fallow! The soil where true religion should flourish in the furrows is
   left, by many, to produce the deadly nightshade of superstition, the
   hemlock of error, or the thistle of doubt!

   Is it not so with some of you who listen to me at this hour? Your
   hearts, your innermost natures, have been neglected and from the finest
   part of your being the Lord has derived neither rent nor revenue! Your
   best acres lie fallow--fallow when you have good need to cultivate
   every inch of the ground. Do you know what happens to a fallow field?
   Do you know how it becomes caked and baked hard as though it were a
   brick? All the pliable qualities seem to depart and it hardens as it
   lies caked and unbroken--I mean, of course, if year follows year and
   the fallow remains untouched. And then the weeds! If a man will not sow
   wheat, he shall have a crop, you can be sure of that, for the weeds
   will spring up and they will seed themselves and, in due time, the
   multiplication table will be worked out to a very wonderful extent!

   These seeds, multiplying a hundred-fold, as evil usually does, will
   increase and increase and increase, again, till the fallow field shall
   become a wilderness of thorns and briars and a thicket of weeds, nettle
   and thistle. If you do not cultivate your heart, Satan will cultivate
   it for you! If you bring no crop to God, the devil will be sure to reap
   a harvest! I fear that I am speaking to some who have never thought
   about this. It has not occurred to them to consider themselves and the
   reasons for which they have a being. There is one text which I should
   like to drop into your ear in the hope that it may drop down through
   your ear right into your heart, "The wicked shall be turned into Hell."
   "Oh," you say, "that is not me." No, I did not mean that for you--I
   have not finished the verse yet. This is the part for you--"and all the
   nations that forget God."

   There are nations of them, so numerous are careless souls! What did
   they do? They did not do anything--they merely fell into a little
   matter of neglect, that is all. They forgot something--they forgot God!
   If I had to tell you how we are to be saved, I might take some time
   about it. But if you ask me how you are to be lost, I will tell you in
   a minute. "How shall we escape, if we neglect so great a salvation?"
   Neglect destroys men! Only sit still and allow matters to take their
   course and your damnation is sure! If you wish to be ruined in your
   spiritual farming, you need not sow thorns--you have only to leave your
   soul fallow and you will starve when the great harvest comes!

   Fallow ground in human nature naturally and of itself will work famine
   and bankruptcy for every man who lets it have its own way. So my text
   begins right well by saying, "Break up your fallow ground." Begin to
   look to what you have neglected! Take a survey of what has come already
   of your neglect! Contemplate what results will surely come of continued
   carelessness. God helping you, go into that field which is up to your
   knees with weeds and look around it and say, "This must be cleared out.
   This must be got ready for plowing. We cannot have this sad waste any
   longer. We have not gone through this gate before. We have scarcely
   looked over the hedge. We have left the field entirely to itself and
   everything cries out against our neglect.

   "Now, by God's Grace, we will enter into it and will clear all the
   rubbish away and pray the eternal God to bring the great steam plow of
   His almighty Grace and tear up the soil to the very bottom and then to
   burn these weeds and make this ground fit to be sown that it may bring
   forth a harvest to His praise." Leaving that first part of the text, I
   am going to dwell upon the second--"It is time to seek the Lord, till
   He comes and rains righteousness upon you."

   I. First, here is A TIME MENTIONED. When is it time to seek the Lord? I
   am not going to try to say anything fine, but something that will come
   home to each unconverted person. May the Holy Spirit help me in this
   attempt and bless it to your souls. When is it time to seek the Lord?
   Well, it is time as soon as ever you know right from wrong. Oh, it will
   be a thousand blessings to you, dear boys and girls, wherever you may
   be at this moment and to you young people that are listening to me, if
   you are led to seek the Lord while you are yet little! While you are
   yet children may you become children of God!

   Before you are permitted to go into open sin, may your hearts be opened
   to Divine Grace. Some of us who were converted while we were children
   will praise God forever, not only for our conversion, but for our early
   conversion. I have often prayed, with much sweetness to my own soul,
   that prayer of David, "O Lord, You have taught me from my youth and up
   to now have I declared Your wondrous works." I look forward, hopefully,
   to the time when I shall add, "Now, also, when I am old and
   gray-headed, O God, forsake me not." If you have had a man in your
   employ ever since he was a boy, you do not like to turn him away when
   he grows old--and our Lord never turns His old servants away. It is a
   surely prevalent plea with him, "You are my hope, O Lord God: You are
   my trust from my youth."

   It is time to seek the Lord as soon as we can seek anything, for to
   such seekers there is the special promise, "They that seek Me early
   shall find Me." I found the Lord and joined His Church when I was 15
   years old and I feel it no small joy to say with Obadiah, "I, Your
   servant, fear the Lord from my youth." Early piety saves from much sin
   and sorrow and is often followed by a blessed and useful life. My heart
   rejoices that He, who was, Himself, "the Holy Child Jesus," suffers the
   little children to come unto Him! Blessed be the name of the Lord for
   young people brought to Christ! May it please the Lord to touch each
   young heart here, at this time, with this thought, "It is time for me
   to seek the Lord." Come, you lads and lasses, you boys and girls, and
   learn of Jesus while yet your life is in its sweetest hours!

   But it is especially time to seek the Lord when it is late in the day
   of life and the shades of the eternal night are gathering. If it is
   time when first the morning breaks, how much more solemnly is it time
   when the shadows lengthen! You cannot live long, dear Friend, for age,
   I see, is taking its toll upon your once stalwart form. In the order of
   Nature you

   must soon be gone. You know that you have passed your threescore and
   ten, perhaps your fourscore years and you are living, now, upon the
   special charity of God. You have run out your lease and are now a daily
   tenant. Surely it is time for you to seek the Lord! You may be gone to
   the Judgment and the irreversible sentence before another Sabbath comes
   round--

   "It may be no tomorrow Shall dawn for you or me. Why will you run the
   awful risk Ofall eternity?"

   Take heed to yourselves that you do not trifle on the verge of
   eternity. With one foot in the grave, oh, seek to have both feet on the
   Rock of Ages! Then you need not fear old age and its infirmities, or
   its closing hours. Jesus will cheer and comfort you and your eventide
   shall only be the prelude of a blessed morning--a morning without
   clouds.

   Dear Friend, it must be time to seek the Lord when death already seeks
   you and infirmity tells upon you. When they that look out of the
   windows begin to be darkened, it is time to look up to Heaven! When the
   keepers of the house tremble, it is time to find a home in Jesus. When
   our grave is ready for us, it is time to be ready for judgment. When
   there are evident signs of an approaching end, it is time that you
   should end your ramblings and seek the Lord! What a mercy it is that
   the very wording of the text gives us encouragement! "It is time to
   seek the Lord"--then there is still time in which to seek the Lord!
   Then it is not over with me, even if I have long delayed. I may still
   come to Him!

   Yes, when you are nothing but a bag of bones with a crown of gray hair,
   Christ will have you! When you can only totter on your staff, you may
   come to Jesus and if you have grown so infirm that even your memory
   begins to fail you and all your senses seem to be departing, yet He can
   give you a child's eyes--the eyes of faith! And He can give you a
   child's heart--the heart of love! And He can make you a new man in
   Christ Jesus! I see a good many here who are aged and I know many of
   them are my fathers in Christ--I speak not to them. But I see some who
   are, perhaps, even though in advanced age, "in the gall of bitterness
   and in the bonds of iniquity." Oh dear old Friends, it is surely time
   that you should seek the Lord! You cannot dispute my plea. Yield to it
   at once and seek the Lord before yet another gray hair falls to the
   ground!

   There are special occasions in which a Divine call is made to men. If
   you remember, we read, just now, the Word of the Lord in which He says,
   "It is in My desire that I should chastise them," and this is said in
   connection with the words of our text, "It is time to seek the Lord."
   Now, have any of you been under the chastising hand of God of late?
   Have you been sick? Do you come up to this house after a time of
   illness? Well, it is a choice mercy to be afflicted! Take care that you
   do not despise it. The Lord has not given you up, it seems, for He
   still thinks it worth His while to put bit and bridle upon you! Waste
   not the opportunity which recovered health brings you, but hearken to
   the Divine call! He smites you that you may run to Him to have the
   wound bound up!

   Or is it, dear Friends, that you have lately lost some of those who
   were dear to you? Are they in Heaven? Are you not going there,
   yourself? Then, God calls you by that baby that has been removed, by
   that godly mother or that Christian friend who has gone Home. He calls
   you and He says, "It is time to seek the Lord." Or have you been losing
   property? Is trade very bad? Have you been out of work and are you
   brought to poverty? Will not these whips touch you and drive you to
   seek the Lord? I sometimes think that I have good reason for trusting
   God because I have nothing else to trust in! And beyond a question you
   might use the same reasoning. Go to God, for everything else is going
   away from you! You will soon have nothing left. O man, be sure of your
   God! When a Christian is in abundance, he finds God in everything and
   when a Christian is in poverty, then he finds everything in God.

   But you cannot do that! You cannot do that, for God is nothing to you!
   And where will you be when all is gone and you have no God? When
   everything departs from you as "a dream when one awakes" and you wake
   up to find that you are "without God and without hope in the world"?
   Think upon this, I beseech you, and let it be a call from Heaven to
   you. "Hear the rod and Him that has appointed it" and, as the strokes
   fall upon you and you smart beneath them, think that you hear each
   stripe say to you, "It is time to seek the Lord!" It will be wise for
   us to add and for you to remember that it is time to seek the Lord
   before the chastisement comes. Is it not a wise thing to escape, if we
   can, from these judgments, for though kindly meant, would it not be
   better if we did not render them necessary?

   Soul, do you want to be whipped to Christ? If God means to save you, He
   will bring you by fire and He will bring you through water! Yes, He
   will break all your bones in the bringing, but bring you, He will! Why
   necessitate the

   rougher means? "Be you not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no
   understanding: whose month must be held in with bit and bridle." Why do
   you need to be goaded like an ox, or driven with blows like the
   stubborn mule? Yield at once! Yield to softer pressure! Be overcome
   gently, sweetly, by His love. Yield yourself to seek the Lord and begin
   to do so under milder influences than what I trust you will be made to
   do by some means or other. Do you not know what the Lord says
   concerning His people? "I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of
   love."

   The deed can be done without much ado! As yet you have not lost your
   children. Your trade is not bad. You are not in ill health. You have
   every mercy surrounding you--then let these cords of love draw you.
   Yield while God is beckoning in mercy and speaking as a lover who woos
   the object of His choice! Come along with you, just as a little child
   does when a nurse holds out an apple, or when a mother puts out her
   hands and with a smiling face says, "Come to me, my child." Hear the
   still small voice telling you that in the midst of your prosperity and
   domestic happiness, it is time to seek the Lord! Oh, if you shall have
   this silver blessing of earthly felicity and the golden blessing of
   eternal love on top of it, how rich you will be! All that you have,
   indeed, to this time, may be compared to so many ciphers set in a row.
   You have seen a child make them on a slate. They all come to nothing!
   But if your God comes and puts His glorious unity in front of them, oh,
   what riches you will have! Get your God, the sacred Integer, to add
   real weight and value to all you have! It is but nothing until He comes
   there. "It is time to seek the Lord."

   Let me argue with any that have been living a life of sin and have
   never come to Christ. Have you not had enough of it? May not the time
   past suffice you? When will you have eaten enough unsavory meat? What
   profit have you in it? What comfort has it brought you? What peace has
   it worked? Can you live on the profit of it? Could you die with sin
   about you and hope that it would make your pillow soft? You know that
   "the wages of sin is death" and, for my part, I judge the work of sin
   to be little better than the wages of sin. Do you not think so? And do
   you not think that you have long enough run risks with your soul and
   more than sufficiently played an awful game of hazard with immortality
   and Heaven and Hell? O Sirs, have you not had enough of the
   unprofitable works of darkness and have you not grieved the Spirit long
   enough? Have you not vexed the heart of Christ long enough? He has been
   knocking, knocking, knocking, knocking, till His head is wet with dew
   and His locks with the drops of the night. Must He tarry still longer?

   Oh, if He means to save you according to His everlasting purpose, He
   will come into your heart's bedchamber if He waits till cock-crowing!
   But do not, I pray you, treat contemptuously your loving, tender,
   patient Lord! Can you make Him wait, even, for another moment? Surely,
   by the memories of His long-enduring love, it is time that you should
   seek His face! Here are some sweet words which I would gladly put into
   your mouths--

   "He has called, I cannot tarry,

   I have heard His voice before.

   I will leave these deadly slumbers,

   And set open wide the door.

   In the north blast He rebuked me,

   And I knew the message well.

   In the south wind now He whispers,

   And no longer I'll rebel.

   Even now again I hear Him,

   Come, my Lord and enter in,

   How can I resist Your knocking?

   Come and cover all my sin."

   There are certain occasions in our lives upon which there seems to be a
   special mark set--a sort of note bank--to make us note well that just
   now is a happy occasion. Tides to be taken at the flood happen in men's
   lives and it is well if they are turned to profitable use.

   I think, dear Friends, that it is time to seek the Lord very hopefully
   when you are in a place where others have sought Him and found Him!
   Your being in this House of Prayer is a token for good. I can bear
   personal witness that there is hardly a seat in this Tabernacle on
   which, at some time or other, there has not sat a seeking sinner who
   has found the Savior! If we marked these seats with golden stars, where
   souls were saved, you would see here many footprints of Grace--holy
   places which angels look on with delight! You are found in a place
   where God is known to do works of

   Grace--it is a place whose name might be called, "Jehovah Shammah, the
   Lord is there." In this place the Lord has brought thousands, many
   thousands, to the feet of Jesus!

   And why not you? Why not you? The same Gospel is being preached to you
   and by the same voice, too, which God has made effectual to others and
   with the same desire that it should be made effectual to you. The
   preacher can truly say that it is a desire which grows on him and
   absorbs the whole strength of his soul--the desire that you should be
   saved. "If by any means I might save some." The place is hopeful--it is
   a very Bethesda, a house of mercy, a hospital of healing! Why should
   you not now seek and find the Savior? Perhaps you are feeling in your
   heart, at this moment, a measure of thoughtfulness and softening--some
   drawings are upon you. This shows that it is time for you to seek the
   Lord--

   "Even at this hour He calls you!

   It is not yet too late!

   He has not closed the day of Grace,

   He has not shut the gate.

   He calls you! Hush! He calls you!

   He would not have you go

   Another step without Him

   Because He loves you so."

   Do not trifle with your heart when it begins to open! Oh, I have known
   some that have come to me and said, "We were once tender and hopeful,
   but now we are like the man in the iron cage--we cannot feel. We are
   almost past concern and conviction and nothing awakens us." Beloved
   Hearer, if it is not so with you, you ought to be thankful, but do not
   rest in your tenderness, nor think that you are any better than
   others--bless the mercy which still waits for you and pleads with you.
   When sailors go to sea, they make use of every breeze--I know they
   would like a brisk trade-wind to carry them along from day to day--but
   if no such wind arises, they are glad of any favoring breeze. If there
   is only a puff, or a capful, they catch at it and tack about to use
   every breath of it.

   Now, though you may not, at this moment, be feeling the secret power of
   the Holy Spirit to a high degree, yet, if conscience is only a little
   awakened, do not let it fall asleep. If the will is only a little
   swayed, do not try to stiffen it. If there is only a little desire to
   seek the Lord, take care of that desire and let it become a hungering
   and a thirsting! You know what your servant does when the fire is
   almost out, how she kneels down and blows on the coals--how she puts
   her hands together and gently breathes the dying flame to life again.
   If you have a spark, may the Lord help you to blow it up, yes, and may
   His own living breath blow upon that little Grace till it becomes the
   master influence of your nature and like a consuming fire burns within
   your soul!

   These are favorable moments, moments to be used before they flee, when
   showers of Grace are dropping upon you and the ground is soft and ready
   for the holy Seed! Take care that you use your opportunity well, for
   "it is time to seek the Lord." And so it is, I think, when the Truth of
   God comes to you, personally, when you begin to feel, "There is
   something about the Gospel which is meant for me. I believe that God
   brought me to this Tabernacle tonight and He has guided the minister in
   His text and is helping him to bring the Word of God home to my
   conscience. I thought he looked at me, just now. I feel sure that he
   means me." Yes, you are quite right! He does mean you and so does God
   mean you and thus He calls you to Himself!

   Arise, He calls you! Lame, blind, dead though you are, He calls you!
   Oh, yield to the sacred summons while now it comes out of the excellent
   majesty where sits His enthroned Son, for Jesus, as well as the Father
   speaks to you! Come! Come at once! Come, you lingering, fainting one!
   Come, all you that labor and are heavy laden, for He will give you
   rest. "It is time to seek the Lord." We have spoken enough about the
   time, if the Holy Spirit will but apply the warnings which we have
   uttered.

   II. Let us now, in the second place, enlarge upon the peculiar work to
   which we are called at this time. Here is A SEARCH COMMENDED. "It is
   time to seek the Lord." "Seek the Lord?" Why, He is here! "Seek the
   Lord?" He is everywhere! "Seek the Lord?" He needs no seeking, for in
   Him we live and move! Yes, but do you not see that it does not refer so
   much to where God is, as to where you are? You have turned your back on
   Him, dear Friend. If you are the person that I mean, tonight, you have
   been forgetting Him and so, because He has not been in your thoughts,
   you have, in a moral and spiritual sense, lost the Lord. He is
   everywhere except in your thoughts. He is not to be sought for as
   though

   He were some hidden thing to be discovered by search or ingenuity--He
   is to be sought after because, as far as you are concerned, you have so
   forgotten Him as to have lost sight of Him. "Seek the Lord."

   I hear the earnest enquirer say, "It must mean that I am now to
   endeavor to realize that there is a God. And that He is very near me."
   Yes. "And that I am speaking to Him?" Yes. "And that He calls to me and
   says, 'come to Me; be reconciled'?" Yes. All this and more is to be
   your finding of God as really existent to you. Begin now to live, not
   as an atheist who is without God, but as a Christian, who has God with
   him and has God within him. "Seek the Lord" means, then, that thought
   and love and desire should all come towards God and realize Him and so
   seek Him. "Seek the Lord?" asks one, "But I am sinful! If I come into
   His Presence, He will slay me, for He cannot look upon iniquity." Then
   you must come and seek the Lord in the way in which it will be good for
   you to come near to Him, namely, through His dear Son!

   As a sinner, you could not come to Him, or He to you, but He has been
   pleased that His dear Son should take upon Himself the form of a
   Servant and be made in the likeness of sinful flesh and "bear our sins
   in His own body on the tree." Now, if you will come to Christ, God is
   in Christ and you will thus come to God! We may not come to God without
   preparation, but we may come to Christ without any preparation! We may
   come just as we are--at once--in all our carelessness, in all our
   nakedness, in all our filthiness! We shall never find God till we seek
   Him by the way of Jesus Christ! My sinning Brother, since the Lord has
   not hidden Himself in Christ, but has revealed Himself in Christ and
   bids you see Him in His Son, I entreat you, attend to this word of the
   text, "It is time to seek the Lord."

   Come and seek Him, now, by asking Him to wash you from your sin that
   you may find Him. Ask Him to change your whole nature that you may find
   Him. Ask Him to make you like Himself that you may dwell with Him. Ask
   Him to help you to serve Him that you may live in the light of His
   Countenance. Ask Him to help you to cast off every false way and to
   abound in His Grace, that the rain of His righteousness may come upon
   you and saturate your soul so that you can never lose His Presence
   again. "It is time to seek the Lord." My dear Hearers, if any of you
   are not accustomed to hear the Gospel, but have been brought up in
   various forms of will-worship, let me beseech you not to think that it
   is of any use to seek a priest, or to seek a sacrament, or to seek
   anything but the Lord!

   You must personally come to God, Himself, in Jesus Christ! And the text
   says not, "It is time to be confirmed," or, "It is time to be
   baptized," or, "It is time to come to holy communion." No, it says, "It
   is time to seek the Lord." That is the pith and core and marrow of your
   necessity--that your soul must seek after God and your heart must come
   into the arms of God as the prodigal son came into the arms of his
   father. Did he say, "I will arise and go unto my priest"? No, prodigal
   as he was, he was not so much a dupe! He said, "I will arise and go
   unto my father." There was wisdom in going at once to headquarters and
   seeking pardon from one who had the power to give it! The prodigal had
   fed swine, but he had not become one of the swine, himself, or he might
   have gone to a father-confessor or a priest! But being, still, a man
   and having come to himself, he sought his father.

   O Soul, I beseech you, seek no minister! Seek to no outward form or
   ceremony, for in the Lord, alone, is your salvation! Every remedy short
   of Divine aid will mock your misery. Time enough have you sought to
   earthly physicians and you are nothing better--go, then, to Jehovah
   Rophi, the Lord that heals you and you shall be made whole! You will
   never be cured of your inward malady by sacraments, though you should
   devour a mountain of sacred bread and drink an Atlantic of consecrated
   wine! You will still be as lost as ever, though all saints and angels
   should come to your rescue-- unless you seek God--God in Christ Jesus.
   "It is time to seek the Lord."

   III. I close with a third point upon which I will be very brief--there
   is A PERIOD SET. How long are we to seek the Lord? "It is time to seek
   the Lord, till He rains righteousness upon you." I believe that very
   much seeking of the Lord is based on ignorance--that there are some who
   really set about seeking the Lord as if they could not find Him and as
   if He were a long way off. This is corrected by the Apostle in those
   memorable words, "Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into Heaven,
   or who shall descend into the depths? The Word is near you." How near
   you? "In your mouth." That is how near it is. "In your mouth."

   What hinders a man's receiving that which is in his mouth? Swallow it,
   man. Swallow! That is all you have to do. It is in your mouth--nothing
   can be nearer, surely, than to have it in your mouth. Oh, if I were
   dying and I had a lozenge in my mouth and I knew that it would save my
   life, do you think I would not suck it down? Ah, would I rest until it
   was down? I would not care if a critic stood by and said, "You must not
   eat that lozenge. You are not worthy of it." I have got it in my mouth
   and your remonstrance comes too late, it is gliding down my throat.
   "Oh, but you must not swallow

   that lozenge: you are not fit to receive it." I have got it and I defy
   anyone to rob me of it, for down it goes. "But you must not, really,
   partake of it. It may not be meant for you. Perhaps you are not in the
   Election of Grace."

   In vain your supposition! I have got it in my mouth and if possession
   is nine points of the law, it is all the points of the Gospel! I take
   it into my inward parts and I will never part with it. That is just the
   Gospel and a sweet way of putting it--"The Word is near you, even in
   your mouth and in your heart." "If you shall confess with your mouth
   the Lord Jesus and shall believe in your heart that God has raised Him
   from the dead, you shall be saved." You have it, again, in our Lord's
   words in His commission to His disciples, "He that believes and is
   baptized shall be saved. He that believes not shall be damned."

   But, about this seeking. You see that there are some that forget that
   it is so very near them and they go seeking, but, if you seek the Lord,
   Soul, whatever of ignorance mingles with the search, I exhort you to
   persevere in seeking the Lord till He rains righteousness upon you.
   Seek the Lord, my dear Hearer, till you find Him! Never be satisfied
   with means! Rest not till you get to the end--find the Lord, or else go
   on seeking. Oh, stay not at Heaven's gate--ask for an abundant
   entrance! Be not content with knocking, but knock louder and yet louder
   till the gate is opened! It is well to be near the kingdom, but it is
   an awful thing to be so near it and yet not to be in it. It is well to
   be persuaded to be a Christian, but a dreadful thing to be almost
   persuaded and then to stop in an undecided condition.

   "Well," you say," "but I may, perhaps, wait a bit longer. I have waited
   long already and I am weary." Suppose it to be so, is it not worth
   waiting for? But I tell you, your waiting is very much through your own
   ignorance. As I have already said, the Word is near you and you may
   have it tonight! Even now you may have it, for it is in your mouth. If
   those poor blind eyes are delivered from the scales that hide a present
   Savior, even now, at this moment, you may give that look of which we
   sing--

   "There is life for a look at the Crucified One!

   There is life at this moment for you.

   Then look, Sinner--look unto Him and be sa ved!

   Unto Him who was nailed to the tree." Yet, if you do not understand it,
   cease not to seek that light may come! Pardon will pay you abundantly
   when it comes. You say, "I have been pleading for months." Then, do not
   waste all that you have done! Come and close with Christ and get, now,
   the answer to all those prayers!

   Think of Columbus within three days of America, that wondrous land in
   which he believed. He saw few signs of it-- here and there a bit of
   seaweed--some little tokens that there might be land ahead. But the
   mariners declared that they would sail no farther upon that mysterious
   sea. Suppose that, within three days of the shore, Columbus had turned
   back? Then he would have lost all his pains for lack of a few hours
   perseverance! And you, tonight, perhaps, within half-an-hour of
   unspeakable joy --you, within the next 10 minutes able to rejoice in
   Christ and find present salvation--will you now start back? No, by the
   Eternal Godhead, push on! O Spirit of the living God, push the sinner
   on and lead him, now, to say, "If I perish, I will perish pleading for
   mercy and hoping in the Grace of God by Jesus Christ." You cannot and
   you shall not perish so! "It is time to seek the Lord, till He rains
   righteousness upon you."

   That is how long you have to seek Him. I will give you a picture and
   with that conclude. You know the story of Elijah when the heavens had
   long been deaf--a bronze concave that mocked the desires of men? He
   went up to the top of Carmel and he began to pray. With groans and
   cries and tears--with his head between his knees he used language which
   only God heard--and it was mighty pleading! Then he said to his
   servant, "Go up, now, look toward the sea." And Ge-hazi went up and
   looked toward the sea--he gazed down there along the shoreline and up
   there above the Lebanon. And then he cast a wistful look around and
   came back and said, "There is nothing." The Prophet, while his servant
   was gone, had been crying more importunately. He had been pouring out
   his soul to its very depths before God, saying, "I will not let You go
   unless You bless this thirsty land!"

   A second time He said to Gehazi, "Go again." I think I see Gehazi going
   and looking, but he perceives nothing. "Master," he said, "there is
   nothing." But the Prophet had still been praying and so he said, "Go, a
   third time." And away went Gehazi, thinking it was a fool's errand. He
   went and looked and in a moment said, "There is nothing. I told you
   there was nothing." But the Prophet had still been praying while the
   servant went and he said to Gehazi, "Go again" for the fourth and then
   the fifth time. He felt, "As the Lord lives, He must hear my prayer,"
   and he gave himself, again, to wrestling with his Lord. Before the
   living God he knelt and he felt that he could not rise until the
   promise and

   the covenant had been fulfilled! Here comes Gehazi. He does not like
   his task at all. "Master," he says, "I have been five times and there
   is nothing! Will you send me again?" "Go again, Gehazi! Go again," said
   Elijah. "Go again."

   And Gehazi goes the sixth time. "Alas!" he says to himself, "I never
   went on such an idle set of errands before." All along the
   Mediterranean Sea he looks and looks and looks again. And back he comes
   with the old tale, "There is nothing. There is nothing. There is
   nothing." But what does Elijah say to him? "This last time while you
   have been gone, I have prevailed. I have believed that I have the
   petition which I asked and I know I have it. Go, Gehazi, go and look! I
   said to you, go again seven times--so go and look again." The weary
   servant is in no hurry to go. The longer he is about it, the more is
   the likelihood there will be nothing to come of it. When he reaches
   Carmel's top and casts his eyes over the sky, there is a little fleece
   of cloud--but it is such a tiny flake that it is not bigger than a
   man's hand.

   What is that to the sky? What rain can come out of a morsel of cloud to
   be measured by a span? He comes back and he declares, "Behold, there
   arises a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand." Up rises the
   Prophet and wraps his mantle about him! The rain is coming and he sends
   Gehazi in haste down to Ahab, to warn him against the nearing deluge,
   saying, "Prepare your chariot and get you down, that the rain stop you
   not." Nobody could hear it, but Elijah had marvelous ears as he had a
   marvelous voice with God! He runs before Ahab's chariot in sacred
   exhilaration of delight! The heavens are already beginning to turn to
   blackness and the first big drops are falling! Elijah has prevailed!

   Now, get to your chambers tonight--you that have not found the
   Lord--and come not forth till you have found Him and He has given you
   Grace as a mighty shower! If, by the morning light, there is but a
   little hope and though you can only say, "God, be merciful to me a
   sinner," keep the watches and continue the prayer! O Soul, though you
   can only cry, "Lord, I believe! Help my unbelief," yet watch on and
   seek on, for the Lord will rain righteousness upon you! A deluge of
   mercy shall descend and your heart shall rejoice, for this is His own
   promise, "When the poor and needy seek water and there is none and
   their tongue fails for thirst, I, the Lord, will hear them. I, the God
   of Israel, will not forsake them." So be it unto you. Amen.

Desires Towards God--a Sermon For The Weak

   (No. 1564)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, OCTOBER 24, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Lord, all my desire is before You; and my groaning is not hid from
   You." Psalm 38:9.

   IT is our earnest desire that all who are in Christ may be strong in
   the Lord and in the power of His might. I would earnestly wish to see
   such spiritual life among us that every man had reached the very height
   of holy manhood and was in possession of the utmost possible degree of
   spiritual vigor. It is a great calamity when there is a very large
   proportion of sick folks in any Christian community, for these must
   draw off the care and strength of the Church from aggressive movements.
   How favored would we be if it could be said of us as of Israel when
   they came out of Egypt, "There was not one feeble person in all their
   tribes." Oh that the day would come when the Word of God shall be
   fulfilled which says--"He that is feeble among them shall be as David;
   and the house of David shall be as God, as the Angel of the Lord before
   them."

   Let no man suppose that there is a necessity that he should always be
   weak in faith, always walk under a cloud, or that he should forever be
   a Mr. Feeble-Mind or Mr. Ready-to-Halt. Miracles of Grace are for
   saints as well as sinners! Feeble minds can be strengthened and
   crutches thrown away. We ought to grow out of the feebleness of our
   spiritual childhood. We should cry to God for Grace that we may get up
   "into the hill country" of holy confidence and there, like Mary, sing,
   "My soul does magnify the Lord." Oh that we might all attain to
   assurance, yes, to the full assurance of understanding, so that we
   should know why we are thus assured and so become rooted, grounded and
   settled in the faith--for then nothing would, by any means, remove us
   from the Truth of God or even move us in the Truth. May the peace of
   God which passes all understanding keep your hearts and minds by Christ
   Jesus.

   I would to God that you might each realize that promise of the 25th
   Psalm, "What man is he that fears the Lord? Him shall He teach in the
   way that He shall choose. His soul shall dwell at ease and his seed
   shall inherit the earth." At the same time, we are most painfully
   conscious that all of God's people are not in a vigorous condition and
   we know that there is a large mixture in every Church of those who are
   sickly, desponding and faint. These we are bound to care for. Common
   humanity demands it, our sacred office binds us to it and the example
   of the good Shepherd constrains us. We must feed the lambs. We must
   "lift up the hands that hang down and confirm the feeble knees." The
   voice of God is heard in our heart saying, "Comfort you, comfort you My
   people," which voice we dare not disregard!

   Indeed, the sympathies awakened within us by a similar experience
   prompt us to be forward in compassion for the weak and the tried.
   Therefore, at this time I would seek out the weary and wounded and
   feeble--not with a view of trying to multiply their number--but with
   the hope of diminishing their number by cheering them till they grow
   out of their low condition. We would not pamper weakness till we seem
   to offer a premium to unbelief, but yet we would feed the feeble in the
   king's meadows till they become strong in the Lord! I shall now look
   after those who cannot get beyond desires and groans and let none blame
   me for this service. If the shepherd spends much of his time among the
   weakly sheep--if he gathers the lambs with his arms and carries them in
   his bosom--if he seems, even, to neglect the stronger sheep because
   they do not so urgently call for his care, no one should, therefore,
   infer that he delights in feebleness.

   Far from it! He is trying to remove it by his tenderness! You do not
   blame the humane for caring for the sick. If great efforts are put
   forth to build or endow a hospital, you do not say, "Sickness is a
   desirable thing, for all this money is spent upon comforting and
   helping those who feel it." Your feelings are quite the
   contrary--though these sick folk become the object of care, it is not
   as a reward to them--but an act of compassion towards them. Let none,
   therefore, say that the preacher encourages a low state of Divine
   Grace--he encourages it no more than the physician encourages disease
   when he tries, by his care and skill, to heal the sick! Whatever your
   judgments may be, I always mean to look after the downcast and the
   struggling! Nor shall the babes be forgotten of my soul while I am able
   to be a nursing father to them.

   In a large family where there are little children there must always be
   arrangements for their feeding. Spoon victuals and milk must always be
   in the house, for if the cupboard contained nothing but meat and
   biscuits, the tender ones would starve. If it should ever come to pass
   that a ministry consisted entirely of the higher doctrines and the
   deeper experiences, it would leave many unsupplied and it certainly
   would not be like the ministry of Christ which had in it as much of
   simplicity as of mystery! A true steward cares for all the household
   and provides milk for babies as well as meat for men. If he forgets
   anything, he had better forget the meat than the milk, for though
   babies could not live on strong meat, men can live upon pure milk. To
   tell the truth, I have known the strong men come into such a condition
   at times that the milk for babies was all that they could take.

   Burly Samsons who can carry Gaza's gates may yet be so reduced that
   they can digest nothing but a milk diet. Those whose confidence is at
   its very height, today, may be brought so low that they will prize
   beyond gold the smallest marks and evidences of Grace and will be
   delighted to take hold upon those elementary Truths of God which belong
   to new-born Believers! Even fathers in Christ are glad, at times, to
   seize upon those simple promises which they left, before, to the most
   trembling of the saints, or perhaps to desponding sinners. If,
   therefore, at this present time I speak to the very lowest form of
   Christian life--if I try to meet the weakest case--I shall not admit
   that I am neglecting the strong. My giant Brother over yonder can have
   a drink of milk if he likes--it will not hurt him.

   Come and try it, my worthy Friend! Receive, again, the simple doctrine
   by which little children live and you will find wholesome fare! Delight
   yourself, by all means, in such grand old doctrine as we were singing
   just now in Toplady's noble hymn, but do not disdain the plain Truths
   of God which must always remain the staple food of the household of
   faith! Come we, then, to the text, "All my desire is before You; and my
   groaning is not hid from You." May the Holy Spirit be our Instructor
   and we shall learn aright!

   I. Our first point is DESIRES TOWARDS GOD SHOULD BE MADE KNOWN TO HIM.
   You, it may be, my dear Friend, cannot see any Grace in yourself at
   all--all that you perceive is a desire to have Grace. You know that you
   desire to repent of sin, desire to be delivered from it, desire to be
   made a new creature in Christ Jesus, desire to be perfectly reconciled
   to God--but you fear that you have come no farther. Now, it is true
   that many desires are of no use whatever. "The sluggard desires and has
   nothing." Mere wishes are sorry things. But the desires of our text are
   earnest desires--the movements of the heart--for they are accompanied
   by "groaning." The Psalm evidently speaks of desires after God, not
   after temporal things--desires which are mainly expressed in the first
   verse of the Psalm, "O Lord, rebuke me not in Your wrath: neither
   chasten me in Your hot displeasure."

   It is of intense, earnest, agonizing desires toward God for spiritual
   things that I am about to speak. Such desires ought to be made known
   unto God. It may be said that God knows our desires and that is what
   the text asserts. I do not doubt the Omniscience of God! But He bids us
   confess everything to Him quite as carefully as if He did not know it
   until we informed Him. We are to declare our cases for ourselves, just
   as David did, for it was not until after he had told out his sad story
   in the eight previous verses that he said, "All my desire is before
   You." We may expect the Lord to treat us as if He did not know our
   desires if we are negligent in declaring them. Does not the Apostle
   say, "In everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let
   your requests be made known unto God"?

   Mark the language--"Let them be made known." The Lord waits to be
   gracious, but He tarries till His people have pleaded for the blessing!
   He knows, but frequently He does not act upon the knowledge till we
   have laid bare our case before Him. Make known, then, your requests and
   do so, first, because our whole life ought to be transparent before
   God. What is the use of endeavoring to hide anything? "All things are
   naked and open to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do." The life of
   every man should be unveiled before the eye of Heaven--but as for those
   who are believers in Christ, even in the humblest degree they desire no
   concealment--rather do they cry, "Search me, O God." We do not wish to
   hide anything! Our hope lies in our heavenly Father's knowing all.

   There should be no wish to hide, even, a stray desire, or to conceal
   the most doleful groan. All should be open and aboveboard between a
   sinner and His Savior. What secrets can there be between a soul
   convinced of sin and a pardoning God? It would have an ill look if we
   still sewed fig leaves together, or hid among the trees of the garden.
   No, let us stand forth and let our covering be such only as the Lord,
   Himself, provides. Take care, then, in prayer, to set forth the secrets
   of your soul before God. Tell Him your sin and spread it out in all its
   sorrowful detail. Tell Him your fears for the past, your anxieties for
   the present and your dreads for the future. Tell Him your suspicions of
   yourself and your trembling lest you

   should be deceived. Tell Him what salvation you wish for and what work
   of Grace it is that your soul desires--make all your heart known unto
   God and keep back nothing, for much benefit will come to you from being
   honest with your best Friend.

   Do this, next, because it is commanded of God that we should make our
   desires known to Him. Prayer, which is a constant duty and privilege,
   is, practically, "desire." It is desire with its garments on. It is
   desire booted and saddled for traveling the heavenly road. Prayer
   without desire is dead--its soul has fled, it is but the carcass of
   prayer. When desire is burning in the soul, it sends up the flame of
   prayer, or the sparks of sighs and groans. Prayer is the fiery chariot
   and desires are its horses of fire! Since, then, we are commanded to
   "pray without ceasing," we are really commanded to make known our
   desires continually. Give utterance to your desire in the best form you
   can, however difficult may be the task. I pray you do this, for God
   would have you confess all to Him. He says that "men ought always to
   pray and not to faint." And again, "In everything, by prayer and
   supplication, let your requests be made known unto God." Jesus said,
   "Watch and pray," and His Apostle said, "I will that men pray
   everywhere."

   And what is this but to make your desires known to God? It is a great
   benefit to a man to be able to express his desires and this is an
   argument for making them known to God! You know your own desires better
   by trying to express them. They are indistinct till prayer sketches
   their likeness and fixes their image. Even should you fail to express
   your desires, their inexpressible character will better make known to
   you their greatness and their intensity. Sometimes a desire that is in
   the heart would at once be extinguished if you were to attempt to
   express it, for you would not dare to allow it to exist after you once
   saw its true nature. A glance at some desires would seal their doom,
   for we should feel them to be unworthy to be presented before the Lord.
   But when it is a holy and pure desire, tell it, for it will relieve
   your heart! It will heighten your estimate of the blessing sought! It
   will bring you to think over the promises made to such desires and it
   will, thereby, strengthen your hope that your desire will be fulfilled
   and enable you, by faith, to obtain it.

   The prayerful expression of one desire will often quicken further
   desires and make a thousand of them where there was but one. If you
   will make known your desire before your God it will gather strength and
   soon obtain fulfillment. Desire should not be like a bird shut in
   within the ark--it should be sent out as Noah sent forth his dove.
   There! Let it fly towards Heaven! It will come home bearing the
   olive-leaf in its mouth. The return of prayer brings peace, therefore
   send it on its profitable errand and never attempt to hold it in the
   cage of silence! Though it has lain among the pots and is grimed with
   groans, let it mount towards Heaven and soon its wings will be covered
   with silver and its feathers with yellow gold! By prayer shoot out the
   arrows of desire from the quiver of your heart, for every one of them
   shall smite your enemies.

   Perhaps you feel that you cannot pray because you are under so dense a
   gloom--but that is the time to double your desires and your pleading! I
   am told that the flower, of which the ancients used to say so much
   because it always turns toward the sun, is said to follow the great
   lord of day just as much in cloudy weather as when his bright beams
   gladden all things. What? Though the sun is not visible, yet he is
   still in his sphere and the nature of the flower seems to tell it in
   what direction to turn! Be it ever so with our soul in gloomy hours!
   When we cannot see the Lord's face, may we still look towards Him with
   strong desire. O Soul, pray even when God does not appear to hear! When
   your eyes are blinded with tears, turn your mournful face towards the
   Mercy Seat and look towards His holy hill!

   Remember where He was known to manifest Himself to you. If He meets you
   not today at Zion's gates, yet remember Him from the Hermonites and the
   hill Mizar, where He revealed Himself, before, and let your desires
   follow hard after Him until you find Him again! Let nothing stop you
   from desiring and pouring out your complaint, for herein is the way of
   health to your soul. A gracious expression of desire before God will
   often be to you a proof that those desires are right. A desire that you
   dare tell to God is sure to be of a godly sort. If I can say, "O Lord,
   all my desire is before You and I wish it to be before You--I court
   Your inspection because I hope You will fulfill the desire," then my
   wish is such as conscience approves and is right and good! Is there not
   comfort in this for those of you who think you have nothing more than
   desires? If you have desires which you wish the Lord to know of, they
   must be right--you would not dare to bring them before God if they were
   not good desires!

   When you are in God's House and with God's people, or reading God's
   Word, or when you are drawing near to God in contemplation, then these
   desires are strongest. Now, if they were bad desires, they would not
   flourish in the best of atmos-pheres--they would not be watered and
   nourished by the best of influences--for such influences would tend to
   kill ill weeds of strange desire. So, then, there is some good thing in
   you towards the Lord God of Israel after all! You would not

   have these heavings of your soul, these strivings of your heart, this
   panting, hungering and thirsting if it were not that there is somewhat
   in you of the Spirit's working! God has dealt graciously with you in
   giving you these good desires! Sparks of everlasting life are alive
   within your spirit so long as you have spiritual hunger and thirst,
   your desire must be a good thing or you would not dare to make it known
   to God and, seeing that it is a good thing, take care you nurture it
   well and cause it to grow by expressing it with your whole heart before
   God.

   II. This leads up to my second head which is this--DESIRES TOWARDS GOD
   ARE GRACIOUS THINGS. Intense

   groaning desires towards God are, in themselves, works of Grace. For
   certainly, first, they are associated with other Graces. When a man can
   say, "All my desire is toward God and my heart groans after Him and yet
   I find little in myself but these desires," I think we can point him to
   some other good things which are in his heart. Surely humility is
   apparent! You take a right view of yourself, O man of desires! A lowly
   esteem have you of yourself and this is well. I would to God that some
   who are full of bragging and boasts about their holiness could only be
   as safe as you are with your desires and groans, for there is in you
   that broken and contrite heart which the Lord will not despise.

   God has given you this jewel among the rest--a meek and lowly spirit.
   Yes, and there is faith in you, for no man heartily desires to believe
   unless he does, in some measure, already believe. There is a measure of
   believing in every true desire after believing. If you say, "I desire
   to trust Christ," why, Soul, you trust Him, already, in some degree,
   since you believe that He is the kind of Person whom it would be right
   to trust! Your desire to cast yourself wholly upon Christ has in it the
   beginning of saving faith! You have the grain of mustard seed within
   you which will grow into a great tree. I can tell the mustard by its
   taste--the strength of your desire, its pungency and heat--betray the
   genuine seed. And you have love, too. I am sure of it! Did ever a man
   desire to love that which he did not love already? You have already
   some affection toward the Lord Jesus, some drawings of your heart
   Christward, or else you would not sigh and cry to be more filled with
   it.

   He who loves most is the very man who most passionately desires to love
   more. Love and desire keep pace in Christians so that the more love,
   the more desire to love--and so I gather that this desire of yours to
   love Jesus is a sure evidence that you love Him already! Your desire is
   the smoke which proves that there is fire in your soul. A living flame
   lingers among the embers and, with a little fanning, it will reveal
   itself! Your desire to serve God is obedience! Your desire to pray is
   prayer! Your desire to praise is praise! I am sure, also, that you have
   some hope, for a man does not continue to groan out before his God and
   to make his desire known unless he has some hope that his desire will
   be satisfied and that his grief will be relieved. David lets out the
   secret of his own hope, for he says in the 15th verse, "In You, O Lord,
   do I hope." You, my downcast Brother, do not hope anywhere else, do
   you? You know that every other door is shut; every other road is
   blocked up except that which leads from your soul to God. I know you
   have some hope and, therefore, if you have no hope anywhere else I am
   persuaded that you have a hope in God!

   That thought of God which makes you cry, "Hope in God, for I shall yet
   praise Him," has the seeds of hope and the beginning of comfort within
   it. I might go over many of the Graces, but these will suffice--as a
   man is known by his company, so may our desires be known by their
   attendants--and as holy desires after God keep company with humility
   and faith and love and hope, I am persuaded they are of like character
   and are gracious themselves. Another proof that they are gracious is
   that they come from God. Desires after God must come from some source
   or other. If you desire to be holy, where did that desire come from?
   From your own corrupt nature? Impossible! Certain believers in free
   will may think so, but we are not agreed with them. We believe that
   none can bring a clean thing out of an unclean, neither can thorns
   bring forth figs. If there is a desiring and a groaning of the heart
   after God in your bosom, depend upon it, human nature never originated
   it!

   Can sin desire holiness, or death pant for life? Holy desires are
   plants which are by no means native to the soil of human nature--their
   seed comes from a far country. Do you think the devil worked these holy
   desires? Listen, Brother--does the devil make you thirst after God?
   Does he make you sigh and cry after the light of your Father's
   Countenance? Does he make you pray to be delivered from temptation?
   Does he make you sigh to be conformed to the image of Christ? Then the
   devil has very greatly altered since I met him, last, and since he was
   described in Holy Writ, or seen in the conflicts of good men! Who,
   then, has kindled these heavenly flames of desire? I earnestly
   acknowledge my belief that every pure desire is as much the work of God
   as the Grace which it desires! He who sincerely longs to be right with
   God has already somewhat of a work of Divine Grace within his soul
   creating those aspirations. Now, as God can say of all that He creates,
   "It is very good," I come to the conclusion that these groaning desires
   after God are very good. They are not great, nor strong, but they are

   gracious. There is water in a drop as well as in the sea. There is life
   in a gnat as well as in an elephant. There is light in a beam as well
   as in the sun and so is there Grace in a desire as truly as in complete
   sanctification!

   Thirdly, holy desires are a great test of character--a test of eminent
   value. You ask, "Can you judge a man's character by his desires?" I
   answer, yes. I will give you the other side of the question that you
   may see our side all the more clearly. You may certainly judge a bad
   man by his desires. Here is a man who desires to be a thief. Well, he
   is a thief in heart and spirit. Who would trust him in his house, now
   that he knows that he groans to rob and steal? Here is a man who
   desires to be an adulterer--is he not, in God's sight, already such?
   Did not Jesus tell us so? Here is a man who desires to be a
   Sabbath-breaker but he is compelled by his situation to attend the
   House of God--he is already, in God's sight, a Sabbath-breaker because
   he would follow his own works on God's holy day if he had the
   opportunity. The desire to commit a fraud and especially the earnest
   desire to do it, would prove a man to be a villain at heart. If a man
   were to say, "I want to cut my enemy's throat. I am full of revenge. I
   am groaning to murder him." Is he not a murderer, already, before God?

   Let us, then, measure out justice in our own case by the rule which we
   allow towards others. Let me help you to apply the principle. If you
   have a desire, an earnest, agonizing desire towards that which is
   right, even though, through the infirmity of the flesh and the
   corruption of your nature, you do not reach to the height of your
   desire, yet that desire is a test of your character. The main set of
   the current determines its direction--the main bent of the desire is
   the test of the life. It is well with you even though you have to cry
   with Paul, "To will is present with me, but how to perform that which I
   would, I find not." If you earnestly desire to love God, you do love
   Him! If you desire to be purified. If with a strong, continual,
   agonizing desire you pine for it--already the work of purification has
   begun, for your desire has been purified--your wish, your will, your
   heart have already been purified! Is there not proof enough that there
   is a measure of graciousness about true desires after God?

   Note, further, that our desires are a test very much superior to
   several other favorite modes of self-judging. For instance, many people
   judge their religion by the regularity of their attention to its
   outward duties. "I was never absent on a Sunday morning, nor even from
   an evening service. I attend communion at least once a month. I go to
   the Prayer Meetings, I read a chapter or half a chapter every day. I
   bow my knees at my bedside every morning and evening--I have never
   omitted any part of my duty for many years." I am very glad to hear it,
   respected Friend, but if you have no desires towards God, all your
   regularity of attendance does but liken you to the Church clock which
   is quite as punctual, or to the pulpit Bible, which never leaves its
   place. You may be a capital Pharisee, but you are not a true Christian
   unless your soul is full of living desires!

   If you cry out, "I am thirsting for God, the living God. My spirit
   groans after holiness. When I have bowed my knee, I groan before God
   because I cannot live as I would, or even pray as I desire to pray. I
   have come to the House of God longing to be fed with spiritual meat. I
   have always been a hungry soul towards Divine things." Then I quote my
   Master's words, "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after
   righteousness, for they shall be filled." Living desires are better
   than dead duties--as a living dog is better than a dead lion. The most
   regular outward performance of pious duties may be the revolution of
   heartless machinery, but desires mean life and life is necessary if we
   would please the living God! Desires are a better test than the
   self-congratulation I have sometimes met with about the possession of
   gracious things. I say not better than the possession of Graces, but
   better than the supposed possession of them.

   Did you say, "I have faith. I can move mountains"? I had sooner hear
   you say, "Lord, increase our faith." Did you boast, "I have love so
   that I shall never backslide or deny Christ"? I had rather you should
   say, "Hold me up and I shall be safe." Do you say, "I have experience
   and shall never be misled. I can hear heresy and be none the worse"?
   Ah, yes, I have heard that kind of talk, but I feel safer about a man
   who says, "Preserve me, O Lord, for in You do I put my trust." Remember
   that the chief of the Apostles said--"Brethren, I count not myself to
   have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things
   which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before,
   I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in
   Christ Jesus."

   We feel surer as to the Grace in a man's heart who groans after more
   Grace than we do of him who boasts--"I am rich and increased in goods
   and have need of nothing." A man may be full and dead! But he who
   hungers is alive. Brothers and Sisters, if your soul is desiring and
   crying and groaning after God, do not condemn yourself because you
   cannot speak quite so positively as others as to your safety or your
   sanctity! Desire on and groan on, but at the same time get nearer to
   the Cross! Trust more completely! Look out of self and rest more fully
   in the Covenant promises of God. Your state is not one

   to cause trouble--it is painful but it is not perilous. I am sure that
   there is a graciousness about holy desires because they have been very
   prominent in the very best of men. Look at David! See how his soul
   longs, yes, even faints! Hear how he pants, like a hart for the water
   brook, that he may draw near to God!

   His Psalms are very largely made up of desires--they abound with such
   passages as, "One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek
   after." "Unto You, O Lord, do I lift up my soul." "My soul thirsts for
   God." All his desires went heavenward, for he said, "Whom have I in
   Heaven but You?" And in his last hours he exclaimed concerning the
   Covenant of Grace, "This is all my salvation and all my desire." Nor
   must we forget Daniel. In the passage in which Daniel is spoken of as a
   "man greatly beloved," which is a very sweet translation--the words may
   be read, "a man of desires"--I suppose that he obtained that name of
   the Lord because he much abounded in holy longing and was accustomed to
   rise from one desire to another. There is a remarkable expression in
   the second of Daniel at the 18th verse.

   When the king had dreamed and none could interpret the dream, the Word
   of God said--"Then Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to
   Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, his companions: that they would desire
   mercies of the God of Heaven concerning this secret." In other books we
   would have found it stated that he asked his friends to pray, but
   Daniel went to the very soul of things and begged them to desire. His
   prayers thrice a day were not formal--they were deeply and intensely
   sincere and, therefore, they were full of desire which is the motive
   force, the life-blood of prayer! Daniel, then, was a man of great
   desires and hence a desirable man with God--a man greatly beloved. As
   for Nehemiah, that faithful servant of God, he began his work by
   praying for a blessing on those who "desired" to fear God's name.

   If you turn to the New Testament, what a man of desires Paul was! He
   was always desiring this and desiring that for other people, until he
   desired for himself that he might depart and be with Christ! A part of
   the inheritance of Israel of old lay on this side of the Jordan, but
   the major portion was on the further shore--and so the major part of a
   Believer's portion for the present lies in desires for things not yet
   attained. A man of devotion is always a man of desires. Among your
   acquaintances you will find the best people are full of longing to be
   better. They know that God has blessed them--they rejoice in every
   particle of Grace they have ever received from Him--but they are always
   wanting more. They are, in spiritual things, as hard to satisfy as the
   king whom Du Chaillu met with in the center of Africa. He gave him a
   huge present of goods and his gracious majesty was overjoyed and held a
   great feast over the treasure.

   But before the week was over his black kingship said to Du Chaillu,
   "Truly, goods and money are like hunger; you are filled today, but
   tomorrow you are hungry again." In one sense he who has obtained Grace
   never hungers, that is to say, he needs nothing beyond his God. But in
   another sense he always hungers more and more, the more he obtains.
   Covetousness of goods is a crime, but covetousness of good is a virtue.
   "Covet earnestly the best gifts." He who has little Grace can be
   content with little. He that has more Grace longs for more and he who
   has most is insatiable to a still larger degree. He has the greatest
   esteem for the heavenly treasure who has had the most acquaintance with
   it and, therefore, he longs to possess all that can be possessed!

   Time warns me to leave this point, only repeating the fact that desires
   towards God are gracious things.

   III. Thirdly, DESIRES TOWARD GOD ARE CAREFULLY OBSERVED BY HIM. Was not
   that the first head? No,

   it was not. The first head was that we ought to make our desires known
   to God--the third head is that they are known. It is wonderful
   condescension that the Lord should observe so poor a creature as a
   sinful, mournful mortal. You heard me read the whole Psalm just now. Is
   it not a terrible description of a horrible sickness? I wonder how many
   of you would like to go and visit a man who was in the condition which
   David pictures and watch over him and nurse him? Here was a man who had
   no soundness in his flesh and no rest in his bones, but was eaten up
   with a loathsome disease and covered with wounds which corrupted till
   they stank.

   The Lord cannot look upon iniquity. He hates and loathes it infinitely
   and yet He looks upon His poor servant when sin has worked in him all
   this mischief. Oh, poor, broken-down Believer, your God still looks
   upon you! Oh you whose wounds gangrene; you who seem, already, to be
   rotting into the sepulcher of apostasy, still if there is any life and
   desire in you, your God is watching you! With tender, loving eyes He
   sees you in your misery and filthiness! The best thought of all is that
   He sees the good points in us for, while David does not say, "Lord, all
   my wounds are before You; Lord, all this stench and corruption are
   before You," he does say, "Lord, all my desire is before You." God has
   a quick eye to spy out anything that is good in His people--if there is
   but one speck of soundness; if there is a single mark of Grace; if
   there is any remain-

   ing token of spiritual life--though it is only a faint desire; though
   it is only a dolorous groan, the Father sees it and records it, casting
   the evil behind His back and refusing to behold it.

   Oh, is it not a blessed matter of fact that my desire is before God?
   Even when I cannot speak it, it is all before Him! I cannot explain it,
   but it is known to Him! It puzzles me to state my case, but it will not
   puzzle Him to solve it and to deal with it and to deliver me out of the
   evil of it. "All my desire is before You," as if David had said, "There
   it is, Lord, I have not kept back anything. As far as I know I have put
   it all in Your view. But, inasmuch as I do not know it all nor I cannot
   express it all, this is still my comfort, that Your eyes miss no point,
   Your heart leaves nothing unperceived! You know all about me and You
   will deal wisely with me!"

   IV. The last head is that EARNEST DESIRES TOWARDS GOD WILL BE
   FULFILLED. How do we know this? If

   men are sighing and crying to God they will be heard--how do we know
   that? Why, first, because these desires are of God's creation and you
   cannot imagine, at least I hope you cannot imagine, that God would
   create desires in us which He will not satisfy! Why, look even in
   Nature--if He gives the beast hunger and thirst, He provides the grass
   upon the mountains and the streams that flow among the valleys for it!
   There is not a fish in the sea nor an insect in the air but what God
   has made provision for gratifying its instincts and its desires. If,
   then, He has put in you a desire after Himself, He will give you
   Himself!

   If He has made you long after pardon, He will give you pardon! If He
   has made you sigh after purity, after eternal salvation, He means to
   give you these. Do you think that God would act towards us wantonly and
   torment us with the torments of Tantalus needlessly? Has He made His
   mercy flow all around you and has He given you thirst and will He never
   let you drink? If He did not mean that you should drink, why has He
   created the longing within you? You do not thirst after God by nature
   and if He had let you alone you never would have so thirsted! You did
   not pine after His love until He made you pine for it--why, then, this
   creation of a wish if it is not to be gratified? Has He made you long
   after faith and yet, do you think, He will deny it to you? Has He given
   you a groaning after His dear Son, Jesus Christ, and will not Jesus yet
   be yours? Soul, He is yours!

   I have seen some treat children very unkindly when, to make sport for
   themselves, they have exhibited fruit or toys to the children which
   have excited great desire and they have acted as if they were going to
   give them to the children and then they have gone away and given them
   nothing and laughed at them. They thought there was wit in such
   conduct, but it seemed to me meanness, itself! God has no such cruel
   ways with men--if He has taught them to desire His Grace, He will
   fulfill their desire because He is always a merciful and gracious God.
   Remember, O desiring man, that you already have a blessing! When our
   Divine Master was on the mountainside, the benedictions which He
   pronounced were no word blessings, but they were full of weight and
   meaning and among the best of them is this--"Blessed are they that
   hunger and thirst after righteousness." Blessed while they hunger,
   blessed while they thirst! Yes, they are already blessed and there is
   this at the back of it, "for they shall be filled." Thank God that you
   hunger!

   Oh, my Friends, if we could make this city of London to be full of
   souls that hungered after Christ, we might pray day and night for so
   blessed a consummation! If we could cause the multitudes of men who go
   up and down these streets, careless of God and of eternity, to thirst
   and sigh and cry after God, what a blessing that would be! Time was,
   perhaps, when you, too, were stony-hearted and had no such desires--the
   change is a thing to be grateful for. Bless God for your grief, your
   agony, your anguish--for anything that is like a spiritual feeling--it
   is better than to be left altogether alone. Here is something
   comforting for your distressed heart--a blessing is already pronounced
   upon you. And we may be sure, dear Friends, that God will hear the
   desires which He has, Himself, created, because He loves to gratify
   right desires.

   It is said of Him in Nature, "You open Your hands and satisfy the
   desire of every living thing." Does God care for sparrows in the bush,
   for minnows in the brook, for midges in the air, for tiny things in a
   drop of stagnant water and will He fail to satisfy the longings of His
   own children? Nothing gives us more pleasure, perhaps, as parents, than
   to gratify the proper desires of a dear child. We like to see the
   pleasure that beams upon the little face when the desire is fulfilled.
   Do you not know that God loves to give us pleasure? It is His joy to do
   it! It is one of the joys of the great Father's heart to make His
   children glad. Be assured, my dear Friend, it is no joy to God to see
   you with that dreary countenance. God delights in the delight of His
   people! He has made a promise to the happy which well fits in with my
   text--"Delight yourself, also, in the Lord and He shall give you the
   desires of your heart."

   He would have us rejoice in Him, for He rejoices over us! If you need
   proof, note well the names He gives us--"You shall be called Hephzibah
   and your land Beulah: for the Lord delights in you and your land shall
   be married." If God delights to fulfill our desires, let us not be
   slack in desiring! If you need a sure proof that He will grant gracious
   desires, let me remind you of His promises. Sometimes one promise may
   stick in the memory and be better than quoting fifty. Here is the 19th
   verse of the 145th Psalm--take it home with you--"He will fulfill the
   desire of them that fear Him: He also will hear their cry and will save
   them." If there is a holy awe of God in your soul, so that you fear
   Him, He will yet fulfill your desire and your cry shall bring you
   salvation!

   The Lord will keep His promise--you can be you sure of that. Has He
   said and shall He not do it? What a joy it will be when you get your
   desire satisfied and how you will praise the Lord! It may not be long
   before your soul's longing is before you. This prophecy I venture to
   make concerning you, that when the Lord has given you the desire of
   your heart, you will hardly know how to extol Him sufficiently! How you
   will bless and magnify His dear name! And what is more, others will
   begin to praise Him, too. In the 21st Psalm, when the king had obtained
   a blessing from God, his subjects began to bless God for him. Read the
   second verse--"You have given him his heart's desire and have not
   withheld the request of his lips." Now, I should not wonder but what,
   before long, others will say the same of you--"The Lord has done great
   things for

   him."

   His wife, who lamented his deep dejection, will bless God and say,
   "Lord, I thank You that You have given him the desire of his heart and
   that You have not withheld the request of his lips." Godly friends will
   hear of his deliverance and rejoice, saying, "He who has long been cast
   down has found the light of God's Countenance," and they will also say,
   "You have given him the desire of his heart." As you spread your new
   joy and perfume the atmosphere with gladness, the saints will bless God
   that He has given you the desire of your heart! I am persuaded that you
   will obtain your desire since it will glorify God for you to have it.
   "Whoever offers praise, glorifies God" and you will praise Him and thus
   glorify Him. Go your way and seek the Lord with confidence through
   Jesus Christ and He will bless you evermore. Amen.

Maschil Of Ethan, A Majestic Song

   (No. 1565)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever: with my mouth will I
   make known Your faithfulness to all generations. ForIhave said, Mercy
   shall be built up forever: Your faithfulness shall You establish in the
   very heavens." Psalm 89:1,2.

   THIS Psalm is one of the very choicest songs in the night. Midst a
   stream of troubled thoughts there stands a fair island of rescue and
   redemption which supplies standing room for wonder and worship while
   the music of the words, like the murmuring of a river, sounds sweetly
   in our ears! Read the Psalm carefully and it will awaken your sympathy,
   for he who wrote it was bearing bitter reproach and was almost
   broken-hearted by the grievous calamities of his nation. Yet his faith
   was strong in the faithfulness of God and so he sang of the stability
   of the Divine Covenant when the outlook of circumstances was dark and
   cheerless. Nor did he ever sing more sweetly than he sang in that night
   of his sorrow. Greatly does it glorify God for us to sing His high
   praises in storms of adversity and on beds of affliction. It magnifies
   His mercy if we can bless and adore Him when He takes, as well as when
   He gives.

   It is good that out of the very mouth of the burning furnace there
   should come a yet more burning note of grateful praise! I am told that
   there is a great deal of relief to sorrow in complaining--that the
   utterance of our murmurs may, sometimes, tend to relieve our pain or
   sorrow. I suppose it is so. Certainly it is a good thing to weep, for I
   have heard it from the mouth of many witnesses. Most of us have felt
   that there are griefs too deep for tears and that a flood of tears
   proves that the sorrow has begun to abate. But, I think, the best
   relief for sorrow is to sing--this man tried it, at any rate. When
   mercy seems to have departed, it is well to sing of departed mercy!
   When no present blessing appears, it is a present blessing to remember
   the blessing of the years gone by and to rehearse the praises of God
   for all His former mercies towards us. Two sorts of songs we ought to
   keep up even if the present appears to yield us no theme for
   sonnets--the song of the past for what God has done and the song of the
   future for the Grace we have not yet tasted--the Covenant blessings
   held in the pierced hand, safe and sure against the time to come!

   Brothers and Sisters, I want you, at this time, to feel the spirit of
   gratitude within your hearts. Though your mind should be heavy, your
   countenance sad and your circumstances gloomy--still let the generous
   impulse kindle and glow. Oh, come, let us sing unto the Lord! It does
   not seem to me to be much for us to sing God's praises in fair weather.
   The shouts of, "Harvest home," over the loaded wagons are proper, but
   they are only natural. Who would not sing, then? What bird in all the
   country is silent when the sun is rising and the dews of spring are
   sparkling? But the choicest choir charms the stars of night and no note
   is sweeter, even to the human ear, than that which comes from the bare
   bough amidst the abundant snows of dark winter!

   sons of sorrow, your hearts are tuned to notes which the joyful cannot
   reach! Yours is the full compass and swell. You are harps upon which
   the Chief Player on stringed instruments can display His matchless
   skill to a larger degree than upon the less afflicted. I pray He may do
   so now, by leading you to be first in the song. We must, all of us,
   follow, but some of us will not readily yield to be outstripped in this
   holy exercise. Like Elijah, we will try to run before the king's
   chariot in this matter of praise! Accounting ourselves the greatest
   debtors of all to the Grace and mercy of God, we must and will sing
   loudest of the crowd and make even--

   "Hea ven's resounding arches ring With shouts of Sovereign Grace."

   1 invite your attention to two things. First, we shall look at the work
   of the Eternal Builder--"Mercy shall be built up forever." Then,
   secondly, we shall listen to the resolve of an everlasting singer--"I
   will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever." I take the second verse
   first--it is necessary for the handling of our subject. You know, in
   the book of Common Prayer, the rubric prescribes concerning a certain
   form of words that it is, "to be said or sung." We will do both. The
   first

   part we will have is the verse which begins, "I have said." And then
   the second part shall be the verse which begins, "I will sing." It
   shall be said and sung, too! God grant we may say it in the depth of
   our heart and afterwards that our mouth may sing it and make it known
   unto all generations! May the Spirit of all Grace fill us with His own
   power!

   I. First, then, let us contemplate THE ETERNAL BUILDER AND HIS
   WONDERFUL WORK. "I have said, Mercy shall be built up forever: Your
   faithfulness shall You establish in the very heavens." I can see a vast
   mass of ruins. Heaps upon heaps they lie around me. A stately edifice
   has tottered to the ground! Some terrible disaster has occurred. There
   it lies--cornice, pillar, pinnacle--everything of ornament and of
   utility broken, scattered, dislocated. The world is strewn with the
   debris. Journey where you will, the desolation is before your eyes. Who
   has done this? Who has cast down this temple? What hand has ruined this
   magnificent structure? Manhood! Manhood it is which has been destroyed
   and Sin was the agent that effected the Fall. It is man broken by his
   sin--iniquity has done it!

   you Devastator, what destructions have you worked in the earth! What
   desolation you have made unto the ends of the world! Everywhere is
   ruin! Everywhere is ruin! Futile attempts are made to rebuild this
   temple upon its own heap and the Babel towers arise out of the rubbish
   and abide, for a season, but they are soon broken down and the mountain
   of decay and corruption becomes even more hopeless of restoration! All
   that man has done with his greatest effort is but to make a huge
   display of his total failure to recover his position, to realize his
   pretentious plans, or to restore his own fleeting memories of better
   things. They may build and they may pile up stone upon stone and cement
   them together with untempered mortar, but their rude structure shall
   all crumble to the dust, again, for the first ruin will be perpetuated
   even to the last!

   So must it be, for sin destroys all. I am vexed in my spirit and sorely
   troubled as I look at these ruins--fit habitations for owls and the
   dragon, the mole and the bat. Alas for manhood, that it should be thus
   fallen and destroyed! But what else do I see? I behold the great
   original Builder coming forth from the ivory palaces to undo this
   mischief. He comes not with implements of destruction, that He may cast
   down and destroy every vestige, but I see Him advancing with plummet
   and line, that He may raise, set up and establish, on the sure
   Foundation, a noble pile that shall not crumble with time, but endure
   throughout all ages!

   He comes forth with mercy. So "I said" as I saw the vision," Mercy
   shall be built up forever." There was no material but mercy with which
   a temple could be constructed among men. What can meet the guilt of
   human crimes but mercy? What can redress the misery occasioned by
   wanton transgression but mercy? Mere kindness could not do it. Power
   alone-- even Omnipotence--could not accomplish it. Wisdom could not
   even commence until Mercy stood at her right hand. But when I saw Mercy
   interpose, I understood the meaning. Something was to be done that
   would change the dreary picture that made my heart groan, for at the
   advent of Mercy the walls would soon rise until the roof ascended high
   and the palace received within its renovated glory the sublime
   Architect who built it!

   1 knew that now there would be songs instead of sighs since God had
   come and come in mercy! Beloved Brothers and Sisters, blessed was that
   day when Mercy, the Benjamin of God, His last-born attribute, appeared!
   Surely it was the son of our sorrow, but it was the son of His right
   hand. There had been no need of mercy if it had not been for our
   sin--thus from direst evil the Lord took occasion to display the
   greatest good! When Mercy came--God's darling, for He says He delights
   in mercy--then was there hope that the ruins of the Fall would no
   longer be the perpetual misery of men! I said, "Mercy shall be built
   up."

   Now, if you closely scan the passage, you will clearly perceive that
   the Psalmist has the idea of God's mercy being manifest in building
   because a great breach has to be repaired and the ruins of mankind are
   to be restored. As for building, it is a very substantial operation. A
   building is something which is palpable and tangible to our senses. We
   may have plans and schemes which are only visionary, but when it comes
   to building, as those know who have to build, there is something real
   being done, something more than surveying the ground and drawing the
   model. And oh, what real work God has done for men! What real work in
   the gift of His dear Son! The product of His infinite purpose now
   becomes evident. He is working out His great designs after the counsel
   of His own will!

   What real work there is in the regeneration of His people! That is no
   fiction! Mercy is built and the blessings that you and I have received
   have not mocked us--they have not been the dream of fanatics nor the
   fancy of enthusiasts. God has done real work for you and for me, as we
   can bear testimony and as we do bear testimony at this hour. "For I
   have said, Mercy shall be built." That is no sham, no dream! It is the
   act and deed of God! Mercy has been built. A thing that is built is a
   fixed thing. It exists-- really exists and exists according to a
   substantial plan. It is presumed to be permanent. True, all

   earthly structures will mold and decay and man's buildings will
   dissolve in the last great fire, but still, a building is more durable
   than a tent, or a temporary lodge in a garden of cucumbers and, "I have
   said, Mercy shall be built."

   It is not a movable berth, but a fixed habitation--I have found it so.
   And have not you? God's mercy began with some of you--no, I must not
   talk about when it began--I mean you began to perceive it many years
   ago. Now, when these heads that are now bald or gray had bushy locks,
   black as a raven's--when you were curly-headed boys and girls that
   clambered on your father's knee--you remember, even then, the mercy of
   your God and it has continued with you! It is a fixed, substantial,
   real thing. Not the old house at home has been more fixed than the
   mercy of God! There has been a warm place for you by the fireside from
   your childhood until now and a mother's love has not failed. The mercy
   of God to you has been more substantial than a house has ever been. You
   can endorse the declaration of David--"I have said, Mercy shall be

   built."

   A building is an orderly thing as well as a fixed thing. There is a
   scheme and design about it. Mercy shall be built. God has gone about
   blessing us with designs that only His own infinite perfections could
   have completed. We have not seen the design, yet, in the full
   proportion. We shall be lost in wonder, love and praise when we see it
   all carried out, but we already perceive some lines, some distinct
   traces of a grand design as we caught first one thought of God and then
   another, of His mercy toward us. Mercy shall be built. I see that it
   shall. This is no load of bricks. It is polished stones built one upon
   another! God's Grace and goodness toward us have not come by chance, or
   as the blind distribution of a God who gave to all alike and for none
   with any special purpose.

   No, but there has been as much a specialty of purpose to me as if I
   were the only one He loved, though, praised be His name, He has blessed
   and is blessing multitudes of others beside me! As I discovered that in
   all His dealings of mercy there was a plan, I said, "Mercy shall be
   built" and so it has been. Yes, more! If I had the time I would like to
   picture to you the digging out of that foundation of mercy in the olden
   times--the marking out of the lines of mercy in the predestinating
   purpose and the ancient Covenant of God. Then I would appeal to your
   experience and entreat you to observe how progressively, line upon
   line, the many promises have been verified to you up till now. With
   what transport you would say, "Yes, the figure may run, if it likes, on
   all fours! Yes, and may go on as many legs as a centipede and yet there
   shall be no spoiling of it, the metaphor is so good! Mercy has been in
   course of construction and is now being raised."

   So the song begins, "Mercy shall be built." But now he says, "Mercy
   shall be built up." Will you try to think, for a minute, upon these
   words--"built up"? It is not merely a long, low wall of mercy that is
   formed to make an enclosure or to define a boundary--it is a
   magnificent pile of mercy whose lofty heights shall draw admiring gazes
   that is being built up. God puts mercy on top of mercy and He gives us
   one favor that we may be ready to receive another! There are some
   Covenant blessings that you and I are not ready to receive yet. They
   would not be suitable to our present circumstances. "I have many things
   to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now." Weak eyes that are
   gradually recovering their use must not have too much light. A man
   half-starved must not be fed at once upon substantial meat--he must
   have the nutrient gently administered to him.

   An excess of rain might inundate the land and wash up the plants, while
   gentle showers would refresh the thirsty soil and invigorate the herbs
   and the trees. Even so, mercy is bestowed upon us in measure. God does
   not give us every spiritual blessing at once. There are the blessings
   of our childhood in Grace which we, perhaps, shall not so much enjoy
   when we come to be strong men. But then the blessings of the strong man
   and of the father would crush the child and God abounds toward us in
   all wisdom and prudence in the distribution of His gifts. And, as I
   thought of that, I said, "Yes, mercy shall be built up. There shall be
   one mercy on another." Would that I had a vivid imagination and a
   tongue gifted with eloquence--then I would try to portray the 12
   courses of the new Jerusalem and show how the stones of fair colors are
   set, one next to the other, so that the colors set each other off and
   blend into a wondrous harmony!

   But I can clearly see that the mercy of the azure shall not come first.
   There shall be the mercy of the emerald to underlie it and there shall
   be an advance made in the preciousness of the stones with which God
   shall build us up and we cannot tell what the next is to be--certainly
   not what the next after that is to be, nor the next after that and the
   one to follow after that! But as I saw half-a-dozen of the courses of
   God's mercy, I said, "His mercy shall be built up." I can see it
   rising, tier on tier and course on course and it gathers wonders. The
   longer I gaze, the more I am lost in contemplation. Silent with
   astonishment, spell-bound with the fascinating vision, I think, I
   believe, I know that--"Mercy shall be built up."

   Moreover, my expectations are awakened. I am waiting eagerly for the
   next scene. The designs of mercy are not exhausted. The deeds of mercy
   are not all told. The display of mercy must reach higher than has ever
   yet dawned upon my imagination. Its foundations were laid low. In great
   mercy He gave me a broken heart. That was pure mercy, for God accepts
   broken hearts--they are very precious in His sight. But it was a higher
   mercy when He gave me a new heart which was bound up and united in His
   fear and filled with His joy! Oh, Brothers and Sisters, let us remember
   how He showed us the evil of sin and caused us to feel a sense of
   shame!

   That was a choice mercy, but it was a clearer mercy when He gave us a
   sense of pardon. Oh, it was a blessed day when He gave us the little
   faith that tremblingly touched His garment's hem! It was better when He
   gave us faith as small as a grain of mustard seed that grew. It has
   been better, still, when, by faith, we have been able to do many mighty
   works for Him. We do not know what we shall do when He gives us more
   faith! Far less can we imagine how our powers shall develop in Heaven,
   where faith will come to its full perfection! It will not die, as some
   idly pretend. There we shall implicitly believe in God. With the place
   of His Throne as the point of our survey, we shall see nothing but His
   sovereign will to shape events--so with joyful assurance of hope we
   shall look onward to the advent of our Lord Jesus Christ and the glory
   that is to follow. We shall sit in Heaven and sing that the Lord
   reigns! We shall gaze upon the earth and behold how it trembles at the
   coming of the King of kings! And with radiant faces we shall smile at
   Satan's rage! We do not know what any one of our Graces may be built up
   into, but if you are conscious of any growth in any Grace, you have
   learned enough to appreciate the oracle that speaks in this wise--"I
   have said, Mercy shall be built up forever."

   Once again would I read this verse with very great emphasis and ask you
   to notice how it rebukes the proud and the haughty and how it
   encourages the meek and lowly in spirit. "I have said, Mercy shall be
   built up forever." In the edification of the saints there is nothing
   but mercy! Some people seem to fancy that when we get to a certain
   point in Grace we do not need to plead for mercy. My dear Friends, if
   any of you get into that humor that you say, "I need not make any
   confession of sin. I need not ask pardon of sin," you are trifling with
   the very Truths of God of which you think you are the most strong in! I
   do not care what doctrine it is that brings you there, you are in a
   dangerous state if you stop there. Get away from there quickly!

   Your right position is at the Throne of Grace and the Throne of Grace
   is meant for people that need Grace and you need Grace now! Perhaps
   never more than now. Without new mercies every morning, as the manna
   that fed the Israelites of old, your days will be full of misery. Your
   Lord and Master taught you to say not only, "Our Father which are in
   Heaven," and, "Your kingdom come," but He bade you constantly to pray,
   "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against
   us." "I have no trespasses," one says. Brother, go home and look at
   your heart. I will have no argument with you. Take the bandage off your
   eyes. You are about as full of sin as an egg is full of meat. Among the
   rest of your many sins there is this rotten egg of an accursed pride as
   to your own state of heart! I said, no matter what you say, "Mercy
   shall be built up forever."

   I expect God to deal with me on the footing of mercy as long as I live.
   I do not expect that He shall build me up in any way but according to
   His Grace and pity and forgiving love. If there are any creatures in
   this world that can boast of having got beyond the need of asking for
   mercy, I have not learned their secret of self-deception! I know of
   some professors who climb so high up the ladder that they come down the
   other side. I fancy that is very much like the wonderful growing in
   perfection of which they boast about! It means full often going up so
   high that they are pure saints in their own esteem, but soon they have
   gone down so low that they are poor lost sheep in the estimation of the
   Churches of Christ! God grant you may not fall by any such process. "I
   have said, Mercy shall be built up forever."

   Brothers and Sisters, if you and I ever get to the gate of Heaven and
   stand upon the alabaster doorstep with our finger on the glittering
   latch--unless the Mercy of God carries us over the threshold we shall
   be dragged down to Hell even from the gates of Heaven! Mercy, mercy,
   mercy! His mercy endures forever because we always need it! As long as
   we are in this world we shall have to make our appeal to mercy and cry,
   "Father, I have sinned. Blot out my transgressions!" Well, that is, as
   I have said, what the text declares, "I have said, Mercy shall be built
   up," nothing else but mercy. There will not come a point when the
   angelic masons shall stop and say, "Now then, the next course is to be
   merit. So far it has been mercy--but now the next course is to be
   perfection in the flesh--that course has no need of mercy."

   No, no! Mercy, mercy, mercy till the very top stone shall be brought
   forth with shouts of, "Grace, Grace unto it." "Mercy shall be built
   up." Yet glance your eyes onward. "I said, mercy shall be built up
   forever." Forever? Well, I have been

   peering back into the past and I discover that nothing else but mercy
   can account for my being or my well-being. By the Grace of God I am
   what I am. The Psalm of my life, though filled with varied stanzas, has
   but one chorus--His mercy endures forever. Will you look back, Beloved,
   on all the building of your life and character? Any of it that has been
   real building--gold and silver and precious stones--has all been mercy
   and so the building will go on! The operation is proceeding slowly but
   surely. What? Though at this present hour you may be in grievous
   trouble, mercy is being built up for you.

   "Oh, no," you say, "I am tottering and my days are declining and I feel
   I shall be utterly cast down." Yes, you may be very conscious of your
   weakness and infirmity, but the mercy of the Lord is steadfast--its
   foundation abides firm--not a single stone can be moved from its
   setting! The work is going on, storm or tempest notwithstanding. There
   is nothing precarious about the fact that mercy shall be built up
   forever. Let not the murky atmosphere that surrounds you blind your
   eyes--the eyes of your understanding--to this glorious word, "forever."
   Rather say, "If I am well set in this fabric of Mercy, my castings down
   are often the way in which God builds up His mercy. I shall be built up
   forever! And oh, if it goes on being built up forever--I am ravished
   with the thought, though I cannot give expression to it--what will it
   grow to? What will it grow to?"

   If it is going to be built up in the case of any one of you, say 70
   years, oh it will be a grand pinnacle, an everlasting monument to the
   Eternal Builder's praise! But you see it will go on--it will be built
   up forever. What? Never cease? No, never! But shall it never come to a
   pause? No, mercy shall be built up forever--it shall go on towering
   upward. Do you imagine that it will go at a slower rate, by-and-by?
   That is not likely. It is not God's way. He generally quickens His
   speed as He ripens His purposes! So I suspect that He will go on
   building up His mercy, tier on tier, height on height, forever! Says
   one, "Will its colossal altitude pierce the clouds and rise above the
   clear azure of the sky?" It will. Read the text--"Your faithfulness
   shall You establish in the very heavens"--not in the heavens, only, but
   in the, "very heavens"--the heaven of heavens! He will build up to that
   height!

   He will go on building you up, dear Brother, dear Sister, till He gets
   you to Heaven. He will build you up till He makes a heavenly man or
   woman of you, till where Christ is, you shall be--and what Christ is,
   as far as He is Man--you shall be! And with God, Himself, you shall be
   allied--a child of God, an heir of Heaven, a joint-heir with Jesus
   Christ. I wish I had an imagination, I say again, bold and clear,
   uncramped by all ideas of the masonry of men, free to expand and still
   to cry, "Excelsior." Palaces, I think, are paltry, and castles and
   cathedrals are only grand in comparison with the little cots that
   nestle on the plain. Even mountains, high as the Himalayan range or
   broad as the Andes, though their peaks are so lofty to our reckoning,
   are mere specks on the surface of the great globe, itself, and our
   earth is small among the celestial orbs, a little sister of the larger
   planets.

   Figures quite fail me--my description must take another turn. I try and
   try again to realize the gradual rising of this temple of Mercy which
   shall be built up forever. Within the bounds of my feeble vision, I can
   discern that it has risen above death, above sin, above fear, above all
   danger! It has risen above the terrors of the Judgment Day! It has
   outsoared the "wreck of matter and the crash of worlds." It towers
   above all our thoughts. Our bliss ascends above an angel's enjoyments
   and he has pleasures that were never checked by a pang but he does not
   know the ineffable delight of free Grace and dying love! It has
   ascended above all that I dare to speak of, for even the little I know
   has about it something that it were not lawful for a man to utter! It
   is built up into the very arms of Christ where His saints shall lie
   imparadised forever, equal with Himself upon His throne!

   "I said, Mercy shall be built up forever." The building-up will go on
   throughout eternity. Yes, and what is once built up will never fall
   down, neither in whole nor in part. There is the mercy of it! God is
   such a Builder that He finishes what He begins and what He accomplishes
   is forever. "The gifts and calling of God are without repentance." He
   does not do and undo, or build for His people after a Covenant fashion
   and then cast down, again, because the counsel of His heart has
   changed. So let us sing and praise and bless the name of the Lord! I do
   hope that, from what little our experience has taught us already, we
   are prepared to cry, like the Psalmist, "I have said, Mercy shall be
   built up forever: Your faithfulness shall You establish in the very
   heavens."

   II. Well, now, we come back to the first verse. There are first that
   shall be last and last that shall be first, so is it with our text. We
   have looked at the Eternal Builder, let us now listen to AN EVERLASTING
   SINGER. "I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever: with my mouth
   will I make known Your faithfulness to all generations." Here is a good
   and godly resolution--"I will sing." The singing of the heart is
   intended and the singing of the voice is expressed, for he mentions his

   mouth. And equally true is it that the singing of his pen is implied,
   since the Psalms that he wrote were for others to sing in generations
   that should follow.

   He says, "I will sing." I do not know what else he could do. There is
   God building in mercy. We cannot assist Him in that! We have no mercy
   to contribute and what is built is to be all of mercy. We cannot impart
   anything to the great temple which He is building. But we can sit down
   and sing. It seems delightful that there should be no sound of hammer
   or noise of axe--that there should be no other sound than the voice of
   song as when they fabled of the ancient player upon the instruments
   that he built temples by the force of song! So shall God build up His
   Church and so shall He build us as living stones into the sacred
   structure and so shall we sit and muse on His mercy till the music
   breaks from our tongue and we rise to our feet and stand and sing about
   it! I will sing of the mercy while the mercy is being built up. "I will
   sing of the mercies of the

   Lord."

   But will he not soon sink these sweet notes and relapse into silence?
   No. He says, "I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever." Will he
   not grow weary and wish for some other occupation? No, for true praise
   is a thirsty thing and when it drinks from a golden chalice it soon
   empties it and yearns for deeper draughts with strong desire. It could
   drink up Jordan at a draught! This singing praise to God is a spiritual
   passion. The saved soul delights itself in the Lord and sings on and on
   and on unwearily. "I will sing forever," he says. Not, "I will get
   others to perform and then I will retire from the service," but rather,
   "I will, myself, sing. My own tongue shall take the solo, whoever may
   refuse to join in the chorus. I will sing and with my mouth will I make
   known Your faithfulness." Oh, that is blessed--that singing personally
   and individually!

   It is a blessed thing to be one of a choir in the praise of God and we
   like to have others with us in this happy employment. Still, for all
   that, the 103rd Psalm is a most beautiful solo. It begins, "Bless the
   Lord, O my Soul," and it finishes up with, "Bless the Lord, O my Soul."
   There must be personal, singular praise, for we have received personal
   and singular mercies! I will sing, I will sing, I will sing of the
   mercies of the Lord forever! Now note his subject. "I will sing of the
   mercies of the Lord." What, not of anything else? Are the mercies of
   the Lord his exclusive theme? "Arma virumque cano"-- "Arms and the man,
   I sing," says the Latin poet. "Mercies and my God, I sing," says the
   Hebrew Seer. "I will sing of mercies," says the devout Christian. This
   is the fountain of mercy where, if a man drinks, he will sing far
   better than he that drinks of the Castalian fountain and on Parnassus
   begins to tune His harp--

   "Praise the mount, oh, fix me on it, Mount of God's unchanging lo ve."

   Here we are taught a melodious sonnet, "sung by flaming tongues above."
   "I will sing of mercies, I will sing of mercies forever," he says and,
   I suppose, the reason is because God's mercies would be built up
   forever. The morning stars sang together when God's work of Creation
   was completed. Suppose God created a world every day? Surely the
   morning stars would sing every day. Ah, but God gives us a world of
   mercies every day and, therefore, let us sing of His mercies forever!
   Any one day that you live, my Brothers and Sisters, there is enough
   mercy packed away into it to make you sing not only through that day
   but through the rest of your life! I have thought, sometimes, when I
   have received great mercies of God, that I almost wanted to pull up and
   to "rest and be thankful" and say to Him, "My blessed Lord, do not send
   me any more for a little while. I really must take stock of these.
   Come, my good secretaries, take down notes and keep a register of all
   His mercies." Let us gratefully respond for the manifold gifts we have
   received and send back our heartiest praise to God who is the Giver of
   every good thing.

   But, dear me! Before I could put the basketfuls away on the shelf,
   there came wagons loaded with more mercy! What was one to do, then, but
   to sit on the top of the pile and sing for joy of heart? Then let us
   lift each parcel and look at each label and lay them up in the house
   and say, "Is it not full of mercy? As for me, I will go and sit, like
   David, before the Lord and say, 'Who am I, O Lord God? And what is my
   house, that You have brought me up to now? And is this the manner of
   man, O Lord God?'" I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever
   because I shall never have finished with them! It is true, as Addison
   puts it--

   "Eternity is too short To utter all Your praise."

   You will never accomplish the simple task of acknowledgments because
   there will be constantly more mercies coming! You will always be in
   arrears! In Heaven itself you will never have praised God sufficiently.
   You will need to begin Heaven over, again, and have another eternity,
   if such a thing could be, to praise Him for the fresh benefits that He
   bestows. "For I have said, Mercy shall be built up forever: therefore
   will I sing of the mercies of the Lord forever."

   What a spectacle it will be as you sit in Heaven and watch God building
   up His mercies forever, or, if it may be, to wander over all the worlds
   that God has made, for I suppose we may do that and yet still have
   Heaven for our home. Heaven is everywhere to the heart that lives in
   God. What a wonderful sight it will be to see God going on building up
   His mercy. Ah, we have not acquired an idea of the grandeur of the plan
   of mercy. No thought can conceive, no words can paint the grandeur of
   His Justice. Ah, my dear Brothers and Sisters, although there have been
   expressions and metaphors used about the wrath to come which cannot be
   found in Scripture and are not to be justified, yet I am persuaded that
   there is no exaggeration possible of the inviolability of God's Law, of
   the truthfulness of His threats, of the terror of His indignation, or
   of the holiness of Jehovah--a holiness that shall constrain universal
   homage but you must always take care that you balance all your
   thoughts.

   In the retributions of His wrath, there shall be a revelation of His
   righteousness, for no sentence of His majesty will ever cast a shadow
   over His mercy and every enemy will be speechless before the equity of
   His award! They that hate Him shall hide their faces from Him--in
   burning shame they shall depart to perpetual banishment from His
   Presence. Their condemnation will not dim the purity of His attributes.
   The glory of the redeemed will also reveal the righteousness of Jehovah
   and His saints will be perfectly satisfied when they are conformed to
   His likeness. On the summit of the eternal hill you shall sit down and
   survey that Mercy City, now in course of construction, built up! It
   lies four square. Its height is the same as its breadth, ever towering,
   ever widening, ever coming to that Divine completion which,
   nevertheless, it has, in another sense, already attained.

   We know that God in His mercy shall be All in All. "I will sing of the
   mercy of the Lord forever," for I shall see His mercy built up forever.
   This singing of Ethan was intended to be instructive. How large a class
   did he want to teach? He intended to make known God's mercy to all
   generations. Dear, dear--if a man teaches one generation, is not that
   enough? Modern thought does not adventure beyond the tithe of a century
   and it gets tame and tasteless before half that tiny span of
   sensationalism has given it time to evaporate. But the echoes of the
   Truths of God are not so transient--they endure and, by means of the
   printing press, we can teach generation after generation, leaving books
   behind us as this good man has bequeathed this Psalm--which is teaching
   us, tonight, perhaps, more largely than it taught any generation nearer
   to him.

   Will you transmit blessed testimonies to your children's children? It
   should be your desire to do something in the present life that will
   live after you are gone. It is one proof to us of our immortality that
   we instinctively long for a sort of immortality here. Let us strive to
   get it, not by carving our names on some stone, or writing our epitaphs
   upon a pillar as Absalom did when he had nothing else by which to
   commemorate himself, but get to work to do something which shall be a
   testimony to the mercy of God that others shall see when we are gone.

   Ethan said, "God's mercy shall be built up forever," and he is teaching
   us still that blessed fact. Suppose you cannot write and your influence
   is very narrow, yet you shall go on singing of God's praise forever and
   you shall go on teaching generations yet to come. You Sunday school
   teachers, you shall be Sunday school teachers forever. "Oh," you say,
   "no, I cannot expect that." Well, but you shall. You know it will
   always be Sunday when you get to Heaven. There will never be any other
   day, there--one everlasting Sabbath--and through you and by you shall
   be made known to angels and principalities and powers the manifold
   wisdom of God!

   I teach some of you now and I often think you could better teach me,
   some of you old experienced saints. You will teach me, by-and-by. When
   we are in Glory we shall, all of us, be able to tell one another
   something of God's mercy. Your view of it, you know, differs from mine
   and mine from my Brother's. You, my dear Friend, see mercy from one
   point and your wife, even though she is one with you, sees it from
   another point and detects another sparkle of it which your eyes have
   never caught. So shall we barter and exchange our knowledge in Heaven
   and trade together and grow richer in our knowledge of God! "I have
   said, Mercy shall be built up forever: Your faithfulness shall You
   establish in the very heavens." Then I said, "I will sing of the
   mercies of the Lord forever: with my mouth will I make known Your
   faithfulness to all generations."

   We will go on exulting in God's mercy as long as we have any being and
   that shall be forever and ever! When we have been in Heaven millions of
   years, we shall not need any other subject to speak of but the mercy of
   our blessed God and we shall find auditors with charmed ears to sit and
   listen to the matchless tale and some that will ask us to tell it yet
   again! They will come to Heaven, you know, as long as the world lasts,
   some out of every generation. We shall see them streaming in at the
   gates more numerously, I hope, as the years roll by, till the Lord
   comes. And we will continue to tell to fresh corners what the Lord has
   done for us.

   We can never stop! We can never cease! But as the heavens are telling
   the Glory of God and every star declares in wondrous diversity His
   praise, so where the stars differ from one another in the Glory of God
   above, the saints shall be forever telling the story which shall remain
   untold--the love we knew, but which surpassed our knowledge--the Grace
   of which we drank, but yet was deeper than our draughts! We will be
   telling of the bounty in which we swam until we seemed to lose
   ourselves in love--the favor which was still greater than our utmost
   conceptions and rose above our most eager desires. God bless you,
   Brothers and Sisters, and send you away singing--

   "All that remains for me

   Is but to love and sing,

   And wait until the angels come,

   To bear me to my King!"

Cheer for the Worker and Hope for London

   (No. 1566)

   DELIVERED ON THURSDAY EVENING, OCTOBER 28, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid,
   but speak and hold not your peace: for I am with you and no man shall
   set on you to hurt you: for I have much people in this city." Acts
   18:9,10.

   IT is clear from this, dear Friends, that even he who was not a whit
   behind the chief of the Apostles sometimes needed special comfort. It
   is possible that even the bravest of the brave may be afraid. Sinking
   of heart assailed even Samson while as yet the thousand slain lay in
   heaps around him. Moses was cast down in the desert and David on the
   throne. Even iron will melt, much more a heart of flesh. Remember the
   faintness of Elijah when he said, "Let me die, I am no better than my
   fathers," and recollect that this was a lion-like man, one of those
   ministers of God who are as a flame of fire! The second Elijah, he who
   rebuked Herod to his face, was sadly staggered while he lay in prison.
   John the Baptist sent to Jesus to inquire, "Are you He that should
   come?"

   No doubt those heroes who have fought the battle of the Truth of God
   and have driven back its adversaries have been men of like passions
   with us and some of them of more than ordinary sensitiveness of
   feeling. Luther said, "Because I seem to be always strong and merry,
   men think that I walk on a bed of roses, but God knows how it is with
   me." Perhaps no man ever experienced such mighty joys and such
   tremendous despairs as did that mighty man who shook the papacy to its
   foundation! Even Paul was not without his tendency to fear. He writes
   in one of his Epistles: "When we were come into Macedonia, our flesh
   had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were
   fightings, within were fears." Do not think, therefore, my dear Brother
   or Sister, if, in working for Christ, you get thoroughly cast down and
   sick of yourself, that you are undergoing an experience unknown to the
   sons of God. It is by no means so.

   Trembling takes hold on all in turns. Faintness is common enough on all
   hands. Fear, like the mist of the valley, steals over the very garden
   of the Lord and there is not a flower in all the borders which is not,
   at times, bowed down with the weight of the chilly damp. But the Lord
   took care to visit His servant when he was in a measure of trouble, or
   afraid of being so. He came to him in the visions of the night. We do
   not expect to see the Lord Jesus Christ in visions, now, for, "we have
   a more sure Word of prophecy to which we do well to take heed, as unto
   a light that shines in a dark place"--we have the Word of God, Inspired
   and Infallible! We have the whole of the Divinely written roll--we can
   read it when we will and from its pages God speaks with a clear and
   certain voice. A dream of the night might, perhaps, be only a dream,
   even in those olden times when God did speak in visions--but this Word
   of the Lord is no delusion! It stands fast forever and ever and every
   promise is sure, being made yes and amen in Christ Jesus.

   When by faith we take the promise, it is as if Christ did speak it
   again to each one of us, for the promise is never exhausted. It is as
   fresh today, when I read it, as when the eyes of saints a thousand
   years ago found comfort in it! God is always appearing to you who have
   believing eyes! God is never silent until we are deaf. He speaks to us
   morning by morning and He has precept upon precept for the quiet hours
   of eventide. The Lord did but appear to Paul during one night, for
   visions are short and few, but any night you like to wake and open the
   Scriptures and seek for the power of the Spirit to rest upon them, you
   shall hear Jesus speaking to you--and any day you turn to that passage
   in Isaiah, you shall hear the very words that Jesus spoke to Paul,
   "Fear not, I am with you," with these additional words, "I am your God.
   When you go through the fire, you shall not be burned, neither shall
   the flame kindle upon you."

   Besides, visions and such like things belong to the infancy of the
   Church--now that she has grown strong, she exercises a greater faith in
   God and needs not that the Invisible should be supplemented by signs
   and wonders. If you plant a tree in an orchard, it is very common to
   put a big stake by the side of it to hold it up. Nobody thinks of
   putting a post to support an apple tree which has been there for the
   last 50 years! In fact, it could hold the stake rather than borrow
   support from it.

   When a ship leaves the docks and passes down the river, you will see it
   towed out till it reaches the sea. But that same vessel will,
   by-and-by, spread all her sails and with a heavenly breeze to bear her
   along, she will need no tug to tow her to the desired haven. The Church
   of God, today, is a tree that needs no support of miracles and visions!
   She is a vessel that has braved for 2,000 years the battle and the
   breeze and will still, till Christ comes, outride every storm!

   At this time, O servants of Jesus, you have the Word of God, which is
   better than visions! Oh, that tonight the Lord Jesus would take of His
   own Word and, by His Spirit, speak it home to all who love Him! Then
   will they be as much refreshed as though they were in Patmos with the
   beloved Disciple. My prayer has been especially that the Lord would say
   to each one here present who knows His name, "Be not afraid, but speak
   and hold not your peace; for I am with you and no man shall set on you
   to hurt you: for I have much people in this city." I am to be
   understood as speaking to every blood-bought man and woman with the
   anxious desire that the words of the text should be laid home to the
   heart of each one. O Spirit of God, make Your servant's words to be as
   fire among stubble, that so the Gospel flame may spread abroad!

   I. And, first, Brothers and Sisters, notice briefly THE TENDENCY OF OUR
   WEAKNESS. That tendency is revealed in the first word--"Be not afraid."
   We feel, when we first find Christ, that we must speak for Jesus and we
   do. But after a while a foolish fear freezes many a tongue and keeps
   many a lip silent that ought to be telling out the wondrous story of
   redeeming love. We get to be afraid. We are not, nowadays, afraid as
   the first Christians might have been--of the amphitheater and the
   lions, or of Nero and his sword. Happily, we are delivered from almost
   all open persecution, but there are times which evidently frighten a
   good many.

   For instance, some are afraid to speak for Jesus because of the defects
   of their education. They fancy that when educated persons are present,
   if they say anything for Christ, they will make a mistake in grammar or
   mispronounce a word and the very learned folks will discover their
   ignorance and set them down for dunces. I have heard a young preacher
   say that in his early days, when he saw a gentleman with a white cravat
   come into the village chapel, he felt that he could not preach.
   Something very dreadful about that, no doubt! Somebody from London has
   entered the cottage where the dear Brother has been trying to talk
   about Christ and he is in a cold sweat and he hardly knows why. The
   stranger has a respectable black coat on and is very different from the
   agricultural laborers who make up the usual congregation and, for fear
   of him, the champion of the Cross is quaking!

   Do you not notice that the good Brother's voice has undergone a serious
   toning down? He cannot speak with freedom and yet, if he only knew it,
   his best friend in the whole congregation is that well-dressed
   stranger. He is afraid of a Brother who would best sympathize with him
   and most earnestly pray for him--the very Brother who would encourage
   him most if they could have a half-hour's talk together. Friend over
   yonder, are you blushing because this incident has happened once and
   again to yourself? Do you not think that whenever you have been checked
   in that way it has been very foolish? Has not pride been at the bottom
   of it? Should we not be willing to be called blunderers? We should
   endeavor to do our Lord's work in the best possible manner, but if our
   education is deficient and we cannot overcome early disadvantages,
   ought we, therefore, to hold back? Should we not be willing to save a
   soul anyway?

   If we can declare the Gospel in a masterly manner, by all means let us
   do it! But if we are slow of speech and uncouth in utterance, let not
   these things silence us. Was not Moses slow of utterance? Was he
   silent? Did not Isaiah acknowledge that his lips were unfit to deliver
   God's message? Was he, therefore, idle? If a man is learned and
   educated, let him reckon that his learning should help him to
   simplicity--and if he is not educated, let him talk about Jesus Christ
   in his own way, with the words that come fresh from his heart and let
   him never be afraid. I have known others to be fearful, on the other
   hand, because they have not gathered educated people to listen to them,
   but are surrounded by a rough lot whose manners and habits distress
   them. Sensitive Christians have shrunk from speaking to such characters
   for, they said, "Ah, they will turn it all to ridicule and we must not
   throw pearls before swine."

   Brother, are you quite sure that you have any pearls and are you quite
   sure that the people are swine? I generally feel as if what I had to
   say was not so pearly that I need be alarmed about the swine treading
   on it! And, also, I have felt, concerning my congregation, that as they
   have immortal souls, there is something about them which differentiates
   them from swine--and anyway, who am I to be so particular about the
   reception which men give to my words? Christ spoke even to those who
   refused Him and shall not I do the same? Our Savior did not mean, by
   that expression, what you think He did. Some parts of our experience
   are choice as pearls and these we may only tell to God's own people and
   not to those who can-

   not appreciate them. But, as for the Gospel, preach it before all the
   swine that ever can be gathered together, for to such is it sent!

   What were all the nations in our Lord's day but a swinish multitude and
   yet He bade us preach the Gospel to every creature! The worse the men,
   the more they need the Gospel and the more we are bound to carry it to
   them! Brothers and Sisters in Christ, it is your business, whoever may
   be around you, to tell what Jesus Christ has done for you! "But they
   would laugh at it." Well, well, there are worse things than that in the
   world! Making people laugh is not the worst thing that can be done. I
   would sooner increase mirth in the world than sorrow. If I made men's
   hearts ache about nothing, as our novelists often do, I would throw
   away my pen and hold my tongue! But if, in consequence of some
   awkwardness or eccentricity, people smile at me--well, if they are the
   happier, it cannot hurt me. Why should they not laugh at me? And am I
   not, after all, ridiculous? "No," says one, "I do not think I am." Ah,
   but my Brother, there is a comic side to you as well as to everybody
   else and there is something about you, I dare say, that is ridiculous!

   I have generally found that the man who could not bear to be ridiculed
   was some precise kind of body who was the very person to excite
   remarks. Oh, be content to take a little of the rough with the smooth
   for your Master's sake! Some hearts cannot be got at until, first of
   all, they feel a keen aversion to what they hear. Better that they
   should rave with wrath than feel nothing! We must get the oyster open,
   somehow, and if this may be done by a tempting bait as well as by sheer
   force, then let us try the gentle experiment. It may be the creature
   will only open out of spite and perhaps it thinks to nip us when it
   shuts its shell--but we thrust in the knife of the Gospel and the deed
   is done! While they are criticizing our manner, we can stab at their
   sin!

   Sometimes the aversion which people display and the contempt which they
   profess to feel for the preacher may only be a secondary means of
   enabling the Gospel to get at them the better and, if it is so, why
   should we be afraid? We have known Brothers who have trembled at the
   slightest degree of publicity. They are tender souls and do not like to
   be seen. I would not harshly condemn all, for certain minds are quiet
   and timid and must be allowed to do good by stealth. But I cannot thus
   excuse all, either, for some are blamably deficient in courage. There
   is a beautiful modesty about them, but I would have them remember that
   modesty is not all the virtues, nor can it be a substitute for them.
   The soldier who was so very modest that he retired before the battle, I
   have heard say, was shot.

   And as for Christian people who are so very modest that they get out of
   the way of everything that is to be done for Christ, I do not know how
   they will answer for it to their superior Officer at the last. Come,
   dear Brother, you sang the other day--

   "Am I a soldier of the Cross,

   A follower of the Lamb

   And shall I fear to own His cause,

   Or blush to speak His name?"

   and so on and yet you are a coward? Yes, put it down in English--you
   are a coward! If anybody called you so, you would turn red in the face
   and perhaps you are not a coward in reference to any other subject.
   What a shameful thing it is that while you are bold about everything
   else you are cowardly about Jesus Christ! Brave for the world and
   cowardly towards Christ!! A Christian ought to be afraid to be afraid,
   for His Lord has said, "Whoever, therefore, shall be ashamed of Me and
   of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him, also,
   shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when He comes in the glory of His
   Father with the holy angels."

   "Oh, but I am naturally timid," says one. It is to you, then, that the
   Lord's word is addressed--"Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be
   strong, fear not." I have heard and I think I have observed that the
   bravest men in the hour of danger are timid in the prospect of it. They
   say that a fire-eater who dashes to the battle is often the man who
   fails, but he who stands trembling at the first shot--in his inmost
   soul dreading death--is, nevertheless, the very man to act the hero's
   part because he is so overpowered by a stern sense of duty that he
   masters fear and steadily keeps his position with cool, immovable
   resolve--

   "The bra ve man is not

   He who feels no fear,

   For that were stupid and irrational.

   But he whose noble soul, its fear subdues,

   And bravely bares the danger nature shrinks from."

   Up, then, you tremblers and play the man! In the matter of speaking for
   Jesus this should not be a severe ordeal. Oh, do not, I pray you, let
   timidity so check you that you cannot speak a word to your own
   children--cannot pray with your own girl, cannot plead as a father with
   your own boy, cannot speak as a neighbor or a fellow workman to the man
   who works side by side with you at the bench. May God help you to get
   out of the cold shade of cowardice, for the text says, "Be not afraid."

   Still, I hear you say, "I am afraid to speak out for religion because I
   should bring down upon myself a world of opposition at home." That is
   painful, my dear Friend, but though painful, it is a part of the cost
   which you reckoned upon when you took up the Cross to follow Jesus. It
   is a part of the cost that, "a man's foes shall be they of his own
   household." "The brother shall deliver up the brother to death and the
   father the child," says Christ. It was so in old times. It is so now.
   It is terrible to think of what some young people have had to suffer
   for being faithful to their convictions. But when we consider that it
   is all for Jesus' sake, happy are they who are honored to endure on
   that account!

   For His sake, what were it if we were martyred? What were it if all men
   did forsake us? We ought to have such an esteem for Jesus that if all
   were to become our foes and to hunt us to death, we would still say,
   "It is well, since hereby I become a living sacrifice for Christ." Now,
   I charge every Christian here to be speaking boldly in Christ's name,
   according as he or she has opportunity and especially to take care of
   this tendency of our flesh to be afraid which leads, practically, to
   endeavors to get off easily and save ourselves from trouble. Fear not!
   Be brave for Christ! Live bravely for Him who died lovingly for you!

   II. We now come to the second point--and this we will also speak upon
   briefly--it is THE CALLING OF OUR FAITH. "Be not afraid, but speak and
   hold not your peace." It is the vocation of faith to be a speaker. When
   the heart believes, the mouth follows suit and makes confession. Faith
   made Noah a preacher and caused it to be said of Abel, "He, being dead,
   yet speaks." "I believed," said David, "therefore have I spoken." And
   others unite with Him in saying, "We believe and therefore speak." Paul
   says of the Thessalonians, "For from you sounded out the Word of the
   Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your
   faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak
   anything." You see their faith had a sound about it as of a trumpet and
   the Gospel was made known, thereby, in all regions! Faith lives on the
   Word of God and then gives a voice to that Word. A dumb faith is a
   questionable Grace. Faith first speaks to Christ and then speaks for
   Christ. It hears His voice and then acts as an echo by repeating it!

   Why ought those that believe in Christ speak for Him? I answer, first,
   because, Brothers and Sisters, we are debtors. We are put in trust with
   the Gospel for other people. Let us not be false to our trusteeship,
   but faithful stewards of the mysteries of God. Let us take care that
   the light is not hid under a bushel and that the talent is not wrapped
   in a napkin. We have the Bread of Life in our houses--let it not be
   hoarded, neither let a single hungry soul knock at our door in vain
   because we are asleep or too idle to attend to the call. We are the
   reservoirs of God's Gospel that it may flow out of a hundred pipes to
   thirsty souls who may come from all quarters of the earth and drink!
   Paul says, "I am debtor, both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both
   to the wise and to the unwise." We owe something to every man that
   lives.

   "Oh," says one, "I do not see that." But has not the Lord said, "You
   shall love your neighbor as yourself? That is a word of very wide
   range, for every human being is your neighbor. The Samaritan was
   neighbor to the Jew. The Roman Catholic is neighbor to the Protestant.
   The Muslim is neighbor to the Christian and the heathen is neighbor to
   us all. You never pass "a heathen Chinese," or a Zulu in the street
   without owing him something, according as you have an opportunity to do
   him good. We are, all of us, of one family and because of the tie of
   the one blood there is a debt of brotherhood from all who are
   enlightened to those who are yet in darkness. Who can tell what we owe
   to Christ? He seems to say, "Pay it back to My Brothers and Sisters. If
   you love Me, feed My sheep; feed My lambs. If you want to do good for
   Me, do good to Mine. Bring in those that I have redeemed with blood;
   for this is the best reward you can give Me for having laid down My
   life for you." You are a keeper of the Gospel Oracles, my Brother. Take
   care, then, that you speak and are not silent!

   But, next, you and I were saved by the testimony of other people who
   spoke to us personally. I owe a great deal of my being brought to
   Christ to my parents to whom I would always be grateful for their
   spiritual care of me. And as a parent, I am to repay that obligation by
   teaching my own children. I owe very much to a very excellent teacher
   in a day school. I did try, when I personally taught children, to pay
   back my teacher by teaching others. I owed still more to such men as
   Baxter and Bunyan who left their books for me to read. I have tried to
   write earnest books, that I may recompense, as well as I can, the
   Church of God for the loan which it made to me in that direction. Most
   of all, I owe my decision, under God, to a man I

   never knew, who humbly and simply preached Christ crucified to me--and
   I would desire to be always preaching Christ crucified to others, as
   the best way of making some sort of return.

   Undoubtedly the most of us were brought to Christ by the personal
   testimony of others and, therefore, we have an obligation to pass on
   the sacred deposit. Even in those few cases in which no living voice
   was used, yet the Word of God was made useful to the soul--and where
   would the Word of God have been if it had not been for Wickliffe and
   Tyndale and those holy men who preserved it to us at the peril of their
   lives and wrote out a translation of it for the common people-- dipping
   their pens in their own heart's blood to accomplish the deed? We are
   all debtors to the Church of God and let us repay the gift! We shall be
   shamefully ungrateful unless we do this.

   Next, let me ask how we to are expect the Gospel to be kept alive in
   the world if we do not hand it on to the next generation as the former
   generation handed it down to us? It is from one lip to another that the
   Word of God is passed with a kind of living flame which books are not
   likely to communicate. Oh, shall it ever be said a century from now,
   "The people of 1880 never thought of us of1980? They let the Gospel go!
   They allowed the doctrines to be denied, one after the other, and here
   we are without them, to perish in the darkness! The people of the
   Tabernacle knew the priceless Truth of God, but they cared not to make
   it known and here we are in ignorance through their indifference"? Oh,
   let it never be so! Let not the next century have to rebuke the
   professors of the present one and say, "You were false to God. Your men
   never preached the Gospel, though they had the gift! Your women never
   told it out to those about you and so the light flickered and almost
   went out and we are now left to suffer for your negligence."

   May God grant that we may be clear of the blood of souls. What a crime
   it will be if we murder generations of men by our cowardly silence!
   Besides, it seems to me that common humanity calls upon every Christian
   to seek the salvation of others. They are perishing! Will you let them
   perish? "God have mercy on them," you say? Yes, but is that all? Have
   you nothing but that hurried prayer to give them? "Be you warmed! Be
   you filled," you say to the hungry and cold and yet you fill them not
   from your own stores. God's curse will light on such inhuman conduct!
   It is ours to labor by pleadings and entreaties to snatch our
   infatuated neighbors from the fiery wave which will soon overwhelm
   impenitent sinners! But if we do not earnestly seek them, they shall
   perish and God will require their blood at the watchman's hands! He has
   set each one of His people to take a part of the watch for the souls of
   men. Are we awake at our post? Oh, see you well to this, I pray you,
   each man, each woman for himself or herself! If we love God, we must
   love our Brothers and Sisters, also. If the Gospel has saved us, we
   must wish to see others saved! Unless we are altogether hypocritical,
   we must burn with strong desire to bring others to the Savior!

   I have been pleased as I have looked around, to see such a goodly
   number of young men here tonight. Never was the weather worse and yet
   our numbers are great and among us are young men in the hundreds!
   Comrades, I welcome you! I would gladly enlist you this night into the
   service of Christ! Come as volunteers! Or if you cannot manage that,
   come as pressed men. Oh, that the Lord Jesus Christ may lay His pierced
   hands on some young men and say, "You are studying, but what for? Study
   for Me and My cause." And to another, "You are working hard to prosper
   in business, but you have another call and you must consecrate yourself
   more directly to Me." Or to another man, "You are in business, making
   money. Are you using it for Me? Are you laying it out for the spread of
   My kingdom?" I would to God that He would call out to Himself a troop
   of valiant ones at this good hour!

   I feel somewhat, tonight, in thinking about London, as Farel did when
   he met with Calvin. Calvin was yet a young man. He had written his
   famous, "Institutes," and Farel, at Geneva, saw what mental force there
   was in him. Here is the story from Bungener--"Farel, alike humble and
   courageous, had often asked if another would not succeed better than he
   and a sort of presentiment had bid him wait in hope of such a man.
   Calvin was unwilling to undertake the work. He was not made, he said,
   for such an office. He was willing to be a laborer in the great harvest
   which was ripening, or to be a soldier of the Lord, but this, he was
   convinced, was not his task. If He had rendered some service, it was by
   means of a book, the fruit of silence and of study. Farel is
   urgent...Calvin educed fresh reasons and it seemed as though he wanted
   to deter Farel by exhibiting to him the defects of his future
   colleague. He knew himself, he said. He was tenacious and obstinate.
   Once more he asked that he might be left in obscurity to busy himself
   in studies, for it was only thus he could be of any value. Then Farel
   broke out, 'Your studies are a pretext! I tell you that if you refuse
   to associate yourself with my work, God will curse you for having
   sought yourself and not Christ.' Calvin yielded to God and not to
   man--and the man always remained dear and venerable in his eyes."

   Calvin was henceforth prompt and sincere in the work of the Lord, even
   when his body was tortured with diseases and worn down with pain. Would
   God I might find some such man here who would, this night, respond to
   the voice saying to him, "Be not afraid, but speak and hold not your
   peace." A youth looks round and says, "I wonder whether that young man
   is sitting next to me?" Never mind about your neighbor--look to
   yourself! Are you the young man? Are you the consecrated woman? Take
   heed lest a curse light on you if you are disobedient to the heavenly
   vision!

   III. But now, thirdly, THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF OUR SERVICE. Let us dwell
   on that a little while. "Be not

   afraid, but speak and hold not your peace, for I am with you." There is
   the first encouragement--God's Presence--"I am with you." When a man
   speaks for God, God speaks in Him. We never go to war for God at our
   own charges--He is sure to be with the man who is with Him. If you seek
   yourself, you will run without God. If you desire honor among men, you
   shall have no honor from God. But if your heart is set upon the
   blessing of your fellow men and the extension of your Redeemer's
   kingdom, God is with you. He never was away from any man who sought
   holiness, virtue and eternal life. What cause, then, can there be for
   fear? If God is with you, who can be against you?

   Have God with you and you have strength enough, wit enough, gold
   enough--for you have Grace enough! Does He not say, "My Grace is
   sufficient for you"? He will give you thought and judgment and
   utterance. And He will give you within all and above all, a mysterious
   power which none shall be able to resist. He will help you to acquire
   what you have not and wisely to use what you have. If He gives you not
   the tongue of the learned, He will use you where your need of learning
   cannot hinder you. He has a sphere for you somewhere. Only trust in Him
   and be not afraid! O that precious word, "I am with you." What more can
   the most fearful require? Come, be of good courage. Take up your cross!
   Take up your daily service! In these shall lie a present comfort and a
   future reward and your God says, "My Presence shall go with you and I
   will give you rest."

   The next consolation is God's protection. "No man shall set on you to
   hurt you." The Jews dragged Paul before the judgment seat of Gallio and
   Paul must have been amazed when he saw the persecutors, themselves,
   beaten. The great King knows how to protect His own ambassador! When
   men meddle with one of God's burning and shining lights, they will,
   sooner or later, burn their fingers. There is a disposition about some
   ungodly men to fly at Christian ministers just as gnats do at candles
   and they generally meet with the gnats' fate. "Touch not My anointed
   and do My Prophets no harm," is still the shelter of God's ministers.
   "No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper and every tongue
   that rises in judgment against you, you shall condemn," is a promise
   which abides the same.

   "Still," says one, "I am half afraid." But then the Lord is your
   protection and who is he that shall harm you if you follow that which
   is good? How feeble all your enemies are! Who are you that you should
   be afraid of a man that shall die and of the son of man that is but as
   dust. "Fear not them which can kill the body, but afterwards have no
   more that they can do; but fear Him who, after He has killed, has power
   to cast into Hell. Yes, I say unto you, Fear Him." The protection of
   God should be a constant fountain of comfort to God's people.

   The last comfort is God's predestination. Predestination is an ugly
   word to some people, but I cannot help that. Here is the doctrine in
   the text--"I am with you and no man shall set on you to hurt you, for I
   have much people in this city." That is to say, many who belonged to
   Christ, though they were as yet heathens. The Lord does not speak of
   those who were converted! Paul did not need a Revelation in the night
   to tell Him that God had much people in that city, if by that was meant
   the persons who professed faith in Christ, for he knew all about them.
   Night and day he had watched over them. But God knew that He had an
   elect people in Corinth whom He must save--a redeemed people that
   Christ specially bought from among men to be His own people, of whom
   the Lord had said, "Other sheep have I that are not yet of this flock."

   Paul was cheered by the good news that God had many chosen and redeemed
   ones in Corinth whom He must save! I learn from this that the doctrine
   of God's predestination is no check to labor. "If there are so many
   that will be saved," says one, "then why do you preach?" That is why we
   do preach! If there are so many fish to be taken in the net, I will go
   and catch some of them! Because many are ordained to be caught, I
   spread my nets with eager expectation. I never could see why that
   should repress our zealous efforts! It seems to me to be the very thing
   that should awaken us to energy--that God has a people and that these
   people shall be brought in! Why, it nerves me to labor when I remember
   that His Word shall not return void--it shall prosper in the thing
   where He has sent it!

   If God has ordained to save men, yet it is a part of the ordinance that
   they shall be saved through the preaching of the Word of God, for
   "faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God"--and not
   without faith and the Word shall

   any man be saved! Nor has God ever said that any should, or ever
   purposed that any should! The purpose embraces the means for the
   carrying out of the purpose and that decree which predestinates the
   salvation of many in Corinth predestinates that Paul should go there
   and that he should stay there a year and a half--and night and day,
   with tears, should seek the souls of men! What a comfort it ought to be
   to all earnest workers that God has many people yet unsaved whom He
   will save and must save! Thus we go to work under the sweet shadow of
   the Divine decree, stimulated by it to labor with all our might.

   The next thing we learn is that the certainty of success should be a
   great stimulus to us. That is why the Lord said to Paul, "I have much
   people in this city." You and I are bound to preach the Gospel, even if
   never a soul were converted by it, for the great objective of the
   Gospel is the Glory of God and God is glorified even in those who
   reject the Gospel! Still, it is a very sweet help to earnestness when
   we know that we shall not labor in vain, or spend our strength for
   nothing. "I have much people in this city" nerves Paul to go forth and
   proclaim bravely, in every place, that Word of God which is to bring
   the people of God home to Himself.

   But, next, we see very clearly that old means and methods are quite
   sufficient to save souls. Our Lord did not say, "Paul, be not afraid,
   but deliver a Sunday afternoon lecture with a nonsensical title and
   little or no Gospel in it." No, no! Our Master said, "Speak and hold
   not your peace, for I have much people in this city." God's way of
   saving souls is the best way, after all! You and I may get up all sorts
   of inventions and He may wink at our follies and let us go on with
   them, but His way of saving souls is speaking the Gospel and nothing
   other than the Gospel! I should like to see in the world, again, a
   revival like that under Jonathan Edwards in which there were no
   extravagances, no utterances of false doctrine, no making a noise and a
   riot--but just the preaching of the old-fashioned Doctrines of Grace!

   Those Truths of God brought on a revival of a deep and enduring kind.
   Men were filled with an awful fear of God and they repented bitterly
   and mended their ways and sought Jesus in dreadful earnest and rested
   not till they found Him! They did not sing jigs, but they wept as one
   that is in bitterness for her firstborn. They flaunted no banners, but
   they laid hold on Jesus in the secret of their souls. They did not
   often shout, but they went home and talked, one to another, of what God
   had been doing in their souls and they lived near Him. I would like to
   see that old kind of work and life among us again! The Holy Spirit may
   work as He pleases, but still, that order of revival seemed to be deep
   and permanent and the results were found after many days--whereas,
   nowadays--where are the converts of your revivals? Where are the
   converts after a little time has passed? All Paul did, when he knew
   there was much people in that city, was just to go and speak the Gospel
   and not be afraid--I, for one, mean to keep to the old-fashioned way.

   Once again, dear Friends, usefulness, according to the text is the best
   protection a man can have. Notice that. "No man shall set on you to
   hurt you, for I have much people in this city." When God means to save
   people by any man, that man will live till the chosen are gathered in!
   He may go to sea, but storms cannot drown him! He may be waylaid by
   ungodly men, but robbers cannot hurt him! He is immortal till his work
   is done! There is no protection for anybody, depend upon it, like
   usefulness--God will not allow the goat to browse upon the branch that
   bears fruit--or the blast to wither. Men of God have gone into fever
   lairs, using all care and precaution and they have been protected from
   the pestilence.

   It has happened that Christian men have been in perils by robbers,
   perils by false brethren, perils everywhere, but they have survived all
   and triumphed in all--and when they have not been thus upheld, it may
   have been because their ministry was ended. They went Home because
   their day's work was over! Where else should they go? They went back to
   their Father, for their Father had no more need of them abroad. As long
   as God has anything for you to do, nothing will ever kill you, my
   Brother! Go ahead and fear not. "I have much people in this city." Go
   to win them and you shall be safe!

   I believe that our position at this time is very much that of Paul's,
   for we, too, hope, trust and believe that God has much people in this
   city. What a city it is! Not one among us has any idea of the size of
   London! You shall go, today, to a well-remembered spot and find
   yourself, all of a sudden, in a region which you never saw before--a
   township which has sprung up overnight! I remember an old oak tree and
   a pond with geese and cowslips growing in the meadow. It is a mile in
   town at the present moment and the tree is gone and everything that was
   around it. Instead of a hedgerow I sigh to see an endless wilderness of
   brown bricks and stucco. Oh, this great city! It grows at an awful
   rate, but God has much people in it, depend upon it!

   I believe God means to bless London largely. You will ask, "Why?" Well,
   I look back upon its past history and I have hope. The martyrs' blood
   lies here! When all the country was yielding its martyrs, London
   furnished its full share. On this

   very spot where we now are, three were burnt for the Truth of God's
   sake. Old chronicles say, "At the Butts at Newington, three Anabaptists
   were burnt." These were among the earliest of martyrs, before
   Protestants were known or thought of. Anabaptists were always a prey
   and they who killed them thought they did God a favor! Members of our
   ancient persecuted Church were often burnt for the Truth's sake and for
   Christ's sake in London--and from the ground, their blood is calling
   still! All over this London of ours, the preaching of the Gospel was
   precious in the old times. You hear the name of, "Gospel Oak," as you
   travel in the North of London and the tree was so called because there
   the Gospel was preached and crowds gathered beneath its shade to listen
   to the joyful sound! All about the city secret groups met to worship
   God after the Gospel way.

   Now, the Lord will never let the blood of the martyrs die out! It will
   forever be the seed of His Church. See, again, how London kindled with
   holy fire in the days of Whitfield and Wesley. Go but a mile from this
   place and notice Kennington Park, once Kennington Common. What
   thousands used to gather there to hear the Gospel preached! The men of
   the south of London loved the Gospel! Multitudes of them still do. I
   feel sure that God will yet bless London because at this very moment,
   if the Gospel is preached so that people can understand it, they will
   throng to hear it! Alas, poor men cannot understand half the preachers.
   They preach Latin fit for drawing rooms. If they would go to
   Billingsgate and learn English, they might get on.

   You say, "That would be very rough English!" Well, but the roughest of
   English might be better than the Latinized jargon of most of our
   pulpits. When men preach the Gospel plainly and simply, they will never
   lack a congregation in this great city, I am certain of it. Away in a
   hack street down in a hollow way just beyond Barclay and Perkins's
   brewery, where there are no cabs, or other public conveyances--right
   out of the world and into the mud--the crowds came and discovered a boy
   years ago and they followed him because he preached the Gospel in a way
   which they could understand. They will find a man anywhere if he will
   but preach the Gospel of Christ! I am sure that the Lord has much
   people in this city because there is a hungering and thirsting after
   the Gospel, if they could but get at it.

   Go ahead, then, Brothers and Sisters! Talk about Christ! Talk about Him
   everywhere! Talk about Him in the workshop! Speak about Him quietly and
   modestly, prudently and gently, but carry out the blessed Words of my
   text--"Be not afraid, but speak and hold not your peace." Be this to
   each one his word of good cheer, "For I am with you and no man shall
   set on you to hurt you: for I have much people in this city." God bless
   you, for Christ's sake. Amen and amen!

The Blood of the Covenant

   (No. 1567)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 14, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "This is the blood of the Testament which God has enjoined unto you."
   Hebrews 9:20.

   [The original title of this sermon was The Blood of the Testament..

   THE Apostle declares that whenever God has entered into covenant with
   man it has not been without the shedding of blood. To a covenant a
   sacrifice and to a testament a death was evidently necessary. It was so
   when the arrangements of Israelite worship were first published and
   established in the wilderness. Paul says, "Neither the first testament
   was dedicated without blood." He probably had in his mind's eye the
   24th chapter of the book of Exodus where we read that after the tribes
   had entered into covenant with God and promised to keep His Law, Moses,
   "sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt
   offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the Lord. And
   Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins and half of the blood
   he sprinkled on the altar. And He took the Book of the Covenant and
   read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the Lord
   has said will we do and be obedient. And Moses took the blood and
   sprinkled it on the people and said, Behold the blood of the Covenant
   which the Lord has made with you concerning all these words."

   As it was in the old dispensation so is it in the new--there could be
   no Divine Covenant, even though it was of Grace, without the shedding
   of blood. Inasmuch as the new Covenant was not the type, but the
   substance, a more precious sacrifice was needed and nobler blood than
   any which is found in the veins of bulls or of goats. Jesus, the Son of
   God must die, or the Covenant would be unsealed, the testament without
   force. No Covenant blessing comes to us apart from the death of our
   great Sacrifice, for "without shedding of blood is no remission," and
   remission is one of the earliest of the gifts of Divine Grace. If we
   cannot even begin the heavenly life by receiving forgiveness of sins
   without coming into connection with the blood, we may be sure that no
   further blessing can come to us apart from it.

   It seems to be absolutely necessary that when God comes into
   communication with guilty man it must be through an atonement and that
   atonement must be made by blood, or by the sacrifice of a life. I shall
   not dwell upon the blood-shedding of the old Covenant, for they are
   only intended to be types of the one great blood-shedding in the death
   of our Lord Jesus Christ. The death of a chosen victim was the emblem
   of the death of Christ. The sprinkling of the people with blood was the
   type of the application of the blood of Christ to the conscience of
   Believers and every single item of the ceremony, if looked into, would
   furnish points for edification. But of these we cannot, now, speak
   particularly, as the Apostle said on a like occasion.

   It suffices us to meditate, at this time, upon the blood of our Lord
   Jesus, once and for all shed on Calvary, trying to understand its
   relationship to us according to the tenor of the text--"This is the
   blood of the Testament which God has enjoined unto you." The words
   which Moses used in the wilderness concerning the typical sacrifice are
   far more emphatic as we point you to the bleeding Savior on the Cross
   and say, "Behold, the blood of the covenant which the Lord has made
   with you." The wisdom of God had many ends to serve in connecting His
   covenants with blood-shedding and this will be very evident if we think
   of its effect upon our own hearts. We all feel somewhat of awe in
   connection with the thought of blood. It is no light thing to see an
   animal slaughtered--at least it is not so to me--I cannot endure the
   sight! As to our fellow men, we can scarcely see the tiniest crimson
   stream issuing from a wound in their flesh without being distressed.

   Tender and sensitive natures, such as all should possess, regard the
   life of men with great care and the blood, as its token, with great
   reverence. We view a corpse with awe and if we were called to look upon
   one who had been slain, we would view the body with horror. If any one
   of us should pass a spot stained with a man's blood, we should tread
   lightly and hurriedly, feeling, "how dreadful is this place." The Lord
   God intended that there should be much of awe about every covenant

   that He made with man, for it is a matter of great solemnity. The
   Covenant of Works might well be surrounded with dread, for by reason of
   our sin it was soon turned into a curse. The quaking mountain, the
   thick darkness and the trumpet voice were fit accompaniments of the Law
   which brings condemnation and so, also, were the basins filled with
   blood.

   As for the Covenant of Grace, it is also rightly surrounded with awe,
   even with such awe as that which bows down at Calvary amid the mid-day
   midnight, the rending of rocks, the opening graves and the groans of
   the expiring Son of God. The God of Love is, nevertheless, a God of
   Holiness and the God who passes by transgression, iniquity and sin, is
   also a God who first vindicates the honor of His broken Law. The Lord
   intended that pardon and all other Covenant blessings should come to us
   in such a way that we should never think sin a trifle, nor conclude,
   from the freeness of Grace that men were free to transgress. The death
   of Jesus manifests the solemnity of God's dealings with sin and is
   fitted to bow the soul in the lowest humility before God.

   The flowing of the blood and water from the wounded side, the wrapping
   of the dead body in the grave clothes, the burial in the
   sepulcher--these are those sad attendants of the Covenant of Grace
   which make us tender of heart while we rejoice in the Divine favor.
   With holy trembling we think of every promise, for the shadow of the
   Cross is over all. Something of aversion and shrinking crosses most
   minds at the thought of blood. One feels sickened and saddened. The
   sight of murdered Abel must have been terrible, indeed, to Adam and
   Eve, unused as they were to gaze on blood. If it would be so to them
   after the Fall, what would the sight have been to them had they
   remained pure and perfect beings? In proportion to purity will be the
   shock to the mind in the presence of death and blood.

   Cruel men might gloat over a battlefield, but to the most of us, the
   sight of a single violent death would be horrible to the last degree.
   Manhood, till it is brutalized, has the greatest possible aversion to
   the sight of blood and it is as though God had selected as the token of
   Atonement that which would show us His hatred of sin. He would move us
   to flee from evil after a sight of its painful and deadly consequences!
   He as good as tells us that while a thing is stained with evil, He
   would sooner destroy it than have it in His sight! Man, the masterpiece
   of the Divine creation, shall sooner be slain and his life flow out
   upon the ground than be allowed to wallow in iniquity! It was intended
   that even while we are being pardoned we should feel horror at having
   been defiled with sin.

   But this aversion must not be used sinfully, as so we have used it. I
   have heard of persons saying, when we preach of the blood of Christ, "I
   could not bear to hear so much about blood! It quite disgusted me." I
   want you to feel shocked because your sin requires such an awful
   cleansing--but you must not be shocked at the great Sacrifice, itself!
   That would be grievous, indeed, to me and fatal to you! Can you bear,
   then, to reject that which, alone, can save you? Are you so delicate
   that you turn away from the only cleansing that can purge you from
   soul-destroying stains? Dare you count the blood of the Covenant to be
   a common, or even a disgusting, thing? I pray you be not so profane!
   Let a holy tremor seize you as you see the Crucified and watch the
   pouring forth of His heart's life-stream! Smite on your breast as you
   look on Him whom you have pierced!

   Grieve that your sin should require such a dread Atonement. Lament that
   you should be guilty of such a horrible thing that even God's own
   brightest One must bleed before transgression, with all its scarlet
   dye, could be washed out. Always love and reverence the blood of Jesus
   Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot. The types of the
   old Law were meant to excite horror of sin and awe in the presence of
   its atonement. It must have been almost a shocking thing to enter into
   the tabernacle at the time of the great sacrifices and, indeed, at any
   time, for year after year there never passed a day without blood being
   sprinkled on the holy curtains. All around, wherever the worshipper
   came, he saw tokens of the slaughter of bullocks and goats and calves
   and rams. Everywhere he saw that God could not be approached without
   atonement--atonement by sacrificial death.

   The priests threw the blood of victims in bowls at the foot of the
   altar and "almost all things were, by the Law, purged with blood"--and
   all to make man see that God saw something horrible in sin which only
   death could hide--and that sin was so intolerable to Him that, unless a
   propitiation had been made, it had not been possible for His pure and
   holy mind to speak with man at all, or hold amicable conversation with
   Him. If the aversion which seems natural to us at the sight of blood
   should lead us to shudder at the cause of its shedding, it will be
   well.

   I beg you, now, to come with me to Calvary and see that great sight,
   even Jesus Christ, Himself, offered up as a Sacrifice for guilty men!
   Herein is a marvelous thing! We have heard so often of it that we do
   not note the miracle of it as we ought to do. But it is the most
   marvelous thing that ever happened, that ever can happen, or that ever
   can be imagined to happen--

   that He who always lives, even God, Himself, should deign to take into
   union with Himself a body like our own and that, being found in fashion
   as a man, He should become obedient to death, even the death of the
   Cross! All former ages are struck dumb with astonishment at this
   novelty of love--the bleeding Son of God! And all the ages that are yet
   to come shall look back to Calvary as the center of all the wonders
   that even the wonder-working God, Himself, has ever worked!

   The blood of Christ is the ruby gem of the ring of love. Infinite
   goodness finds its crown in the gift of Jesus for sinners. All God's
   mercies shine like stars, but the coming of His own Son to bleed and
   die for rebel men is as the sun in the heavens of Divine Grace
   outshining and illuminating all! It surpasses thought--how, then, shall
   I hope worthily to set it forth in words?

   I. Of that death and of that blood we shall speak in a fourfold way and
   first, we shall take the verse as it would most accurately be
   translated--the blood of Jesus Christ is THE BLOOD OF THE EVERLASTING
   COVENANT. There cannot be much doubt that the word rendered,
   "testament," should be translated, "covenant." It is the word used for
   covenant in other passages and though our translators have used the
   word, "testament," many critics go the length of questioning whether
   the word can bear that meaning at all. I think they are too rigid in
   their criticism and that it does bear that meaning in this very chapter
   but, still, all must admit that the first and most usual meaning of the
   word is, "covenant."

   Therefore, we will begin with that reading and consider the blood of
   Jesus as the blood of the Covenant. First, looking from the Cross to
   the Covenant, the blood proves the intense earnestness of God in
   entering into covenant with man in a way of Grace. The Covenant of
   Grace is on this wise--the well-beloved Son of God stood as our
   Representative, as the second Adam, heading up in Himself all those
   whom the Father gave Him. He covenanted with God on our behalf that He
   would vindicate the broken Law and that He would also keep it in every
   jot and tittle on our behalf. As for the Father, He covenanted that
   because of the Sacrifice which the Son would offer and the obedience
   which He would render, He would put away the sin of His people and they
   should be accepted in love.

   This is the Covenant of Grace and faithfulness and to show that the
   august Covenanters were not playing at covenant-making they sealed the
   compact with blood. How dreadfully in earnest was God the Father when
   He gave His Son! How deeply in earnest was the Son when He gave His
   life! You may play with these things if you dare, but God never will.
   You may sprinkle this blood upon the threshold where it should never
   fall and trample on it with careless feet, but God only sees it in the
   place of honor--on the lintel and the side posts--and looks upon it as
   something precious beyond all price! Sinner, you, perhaps, think that
   God will not really forgive you and that His promises may only charm
   your ears to cheat your heart--but it cannot be so!

   God is in real earnest! If He did not mean mercy, He would not have
   given up His beloved Son. The best possession of all His unsearchable
   riches was His Only-Begotten and He took Him from His bosom, where He
   had dwelt serenely always and bade Him come below that He might live
   and die that we might be saved! God is in death-earnest for the
   salvation of sinners! Let us speak of the great Atonement which He has
   provided with earnest hearts, for it is no light thing. I wish that we
   never thought about these things without the deepest possible
   solemnity. I wish that never did a preacher speak of them without
   heart-breaking emotions and that never did we sing a hymn upon the
   great Sacrifice without prostrating our spirits in the dust before the
   Most High. Whenever we think of the Atonement, the place whereon we
   stand is holy ground. The blood of the Everlasting Covenant proved the
   earnestness of the great Covenant-Maker--let us be in earnest, too.

   Next, it displayed the supreme love of God to man. Seeing that He
   entered into a compact of Grace with man, He would let man see how His
   very heart went forth with every word of promise and, therefore, He
   gave up that which was the center of His heart, namely, Jesus Christ.
   When Jesus wept over the grave of Lazarus, they said, "Behold how He
   loved him!" But when God gave His Only-Begotten to bleed over the grave
   of our race, we may more heartily say, "Behold how He loved us!"
   Brothers and Sisters, we have but a faint idea of how much the Lord our
   God loves us! "God commends His love toward us in that, while we were
   yet sinners, Christ died for us."

   There was nothing lovable in us--we were enemies to God, polluted and
   polluting! There was everything in us that was obnoxious to the holy
   mind of God and yet, because of the riches of His Grace and the
   supremacy of His mercy, He would love us and He did love us without
   limit! Passing by fallen angels, the Sovereign Lord looked on the
   humbler creature, man, and so loved him that He gave up Jesus, Himself,
   to die on his behalf! Oh that we were touched with some kind of
   tenderness towards God when we think of this! Man, has God shown such
   love to man and do you show such coldness to your God? Jesus dies in
   unutterable agonies that the guilty may be pardoned and do the guilty
   turn aside as if it were noth-

   ing to them that Jesus should die? Can men treat the Cross as if it
   were either a fiction or a trifle? God has manifested His love in the
   death of Christ in a way which must have astonished every inhabitant of
   Heaven--and it ought to ravish every native of this lower globe! May
   the Holy Spirit enable us, as we think of this blood of the Covenant,
   to behold the earnestness of God and to admire the intensity of His
   love.

   The blood of the Covenant, next, speaks to us and confirms the Divine
   faithfulness. The main object of thus sealing the Covenant with blood
   is to cause it to be "ordered in all things and sure." Men, in old
   times, when they made compacts that were intended to be solemnly
   observed, slaughtered certain beasts as a sacrifice and, when blood was
   thus spilt, there was no drawing back from the engagements. It was a
   covenant made by cutting or dividing--they split the animals in two and
   then those who made the covenant passed in between the divided pieces.
   No revocation was permitted where agreements were thus ratified. It was
   a sort of registered contract that never could be changed when once
   there had been a sacrifice to confirm it.

   Now it is also so with the Covenant of Grace. It is impossible for God
   to ever draw back from the Covenant of Grace, or to change it in any of
   its particulars. He needed not to be held in this manner, for He cannot
   lie--but that we might have strong consolation who have fled for refuge
   to Christ Jesus, He has been pleased to give His Covenant this seal.
   Well do we sing--

   "The Gospel bears my spirit up!

   A faithful and unchanging God

   Lays the foundation for my hope,

   In oath and covenant and blood." It would be blasphemy to suppose that
   God would be false to a treaty sealed with the blood of His own Son! A
   doubt about the love of God and about the faithfulness of God is
   treason against Him, for it impugns His faithfulness and treats Him as
   a liar, or a covenant-breaker, which He can never be. We may think
   lightly of the dark mistrusts and suspicions of our hearts, but they
   are no light things, after all, for they virtually impugn the sealing
   power of the blood and question the faithfulness of God to the Covenant
   which has most solemnly been confirmed.

   Oh you that seek after peace through Jesus Christ, it is not possible
   that God should refuse to accept you if you come to Him through the
   blood of Jesus, for that were to break His Covenant! Oh you who are
   resting in Jesus, it is not possible that your Father should ever
   forsake you, or suffer you to perish, for that were to make the
   blood-shedding of Christ to be void and His Sacrifice to be of no
   effect! Oh, blessed Covenant, how sure you are, now that the blood of
   Jesus is shed! But the blood of the Everlasting Covenant is more than
   this--it is a guarantee to us of its infinite provision. There can be
   nothing lacking for a soul redeemed by Christ between here and Heaven,
   for He that spared not His own Son, how shall He not, with Him, also
   freely give us all things? All that the Christian needs on the road to
   Glory will be quite inconsiderable compared with what He has already
   received in the gift of Jesus Christ!

   Do you believe that God will deny you any necessary thing, O Heart,
   when He has already made His Son bleed for you? If He had held back
   anything, it would have been that costly alabaster box of His Son's
   body which contained the most precious ointment that ever perfumed
   earth or Heaven! But since He broke that precious casket and poured out
   the priceless contents, He will deny you nothing! No good thing will He
   withhold from you! He would break up Heaven, itself, if you should
   require it and pour out the whole creation at your feet if there were
   need. Already He has given you His angels to be your servitors and His
   courts to be your dwelling place! Yes, and His Throne to be your
   shelter--what else do you need? But, if you ask for more, there is more
   provided, for He gives you Himself to be your portion. Is not this
   enough? Is not this all? When He gave you His Son, He gave you all, for
   His Son is One with Him! Oh, the breadth and length, the height and
   depth of Covenant provisions! That roll of love which has for its seal
   this precious thing, the blood of Jesus, must contain treasures beyond
   all estimate. God will supply all our needs according to His riches in
   Glory by Christ Jesus and the blood of Jesus secures this fact!

   I will not dwell longer upon this blood of the Covenant except to say
   that this blood manifests the depth of the need which the Covenant was
   meant to meet. Many preachers, nowadays, seem determined to bring
   everything in God's Word down to their own little scale. They carry a
   ruler in their pockets with which to measure up eternal things. They
   have found out that everlasting does not mean unending--they will one
   day find out, I dare say--that infinite does not mean unlimited! Sin
   with them is an inconsiderable offense which it is not worth while to
   make a fuss about. Man, according to their account, is a poor creature
   who is struggling to be right and his offenses are the excusable
   blunders of a well-meaning

   child--the errors of a poor creature who cannot help making mistakes.
   Of course the punishment of sin, with them, is frittered away and they
   claim to do this in the name of benevolence, as if it were benevolence
   to flatter and a good deed to make sin appear less hazardous and to
   take away the moral sanctions which God has set as barriers against
   evil.

   It follows, in the nature of things, that the Atonement becomes, with
   them, a very shadowy affair--something or other which in some way or
   other reconciles us to God, or has some bearing upon our standing with
   the Divine Being. Nobody knows quite what it is--a misty, hazy, smoky
   nothing, which they cannot quite deny--but which they forget as much as
   possible. Brothers and Sisters, I believe in a great Revelation and, to
   my mind, it is clear that if God, Himself, must become Incarnate and if
   when He is Incarnate nothing else will do but that He must be nailed to
   a Cross and die like a felon--there must have been some awful mischief
   to remove! The race of man must have fallen, indeed, to need such an
   expedient as this in order to restore it to holiness and God! If I
   measure the disease by the Remedy, I conclude that the disease must
   have been deadly! And if, when Christ stood in man's place, being
   perfectly innocent--if nothing else would do as the substitutionary
   pain but that He should cry, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken
   Me?"--then the desert of sin must have been dire, indeed!

   In the presence of Calvary and its Christ I am persuaded that sin must
   be an evil so great that it is not possible to exaggerate its horrors!
   Oh sons of men, your transgressions are black, indeed, since they can
   only be expiated by such a sacrifice! Oh sinful creatures, you required
   a dying God to save you! You cannot be safe for eternity, you cannot be
   happy with God in this life unless the precious blood of Jesus Christ
   washes you! Deceive not yourselves with the notion that perhaps your
   moralities and your outward religiousness may suffice, or that your
   good intentions may be liberally interpreted! You must, if you would be
   acceptable with God, feel the sprinkling of the blood of the Son of
   God, for without shedding of blood there is no remission of sins! This
   much comes to us as the teaching of the blood of the Everlasting
   Covenant--if we are in covenant with God we shall know the power of the
   Atonement of Christ.

   II. But now, secondly, you will bear with me while I take our
   translator's own words--"This is THE BLOOD OF THE TESTAMENT." Upon the
   whole, our translation is as nearly perfect as we can look for a human
   work to be. I do not know what the new translation will turn out to be,
   but the good men will have to have risen up very early and sat up very
   late if they have produced a version which will surpass that which has
   so long been used among us. I do not know. I cannot tell because I have
   not seen it. But this translation very well satisfies me at present and
   I notice that whenever the translators use a word which is disputed by
   scholars, they have excellent reasons for it and the more the matter is
   looked into, the more is their judgment valued.

   They thought a good deal before they settled on their expressions and
   as a rule they came to a sound conclusion. In this case there are
   reasons and very good reasons, why the word, "testament," should be
   used. Our translators were not inspired, but they were marvelously
   guided and directed when they made this version and we may be content
   to take the text as it stands before us. Jesus Christ has made a will
   and He has left to His people large legacies by that will. Now, wills
   do not need to be sprinkled with blood, but wills do need that the
   testator should be dead, otherwise they are not of force. As it was not
   possible that Christ should die other than a violent death, seeing He
   must die as a Sacrifice, the expression, "blood," becomes, in His case,
   tantamount to, "death."

   And so, first of all, the blood of Jesus Christ on Calvary is the blood
   of the Testament, because it is a proof that He is dead and, therefore,
   the testament is in force. If there is a question about whether a man
   is alive or not, you cannot administer to his estate, but when you have
   certain evidence that the testator has died, then the will stands. So
   is it with the blessed Gospel--if Jesus did not die, then the Gospel is
   null and void! Not without the sprinkled blood does the promise of
   salvation become yes and amen! Inasmuch as the soldier with a spear
   pierced His side and forthwith came blood and water, there was the
   clearest evidence in that blood that Jesus was really dead and that His
   testament is valid and operative. Therein do we rejoice, for though we
   sorrow that He died, yet we are glad that His legacy of love is all our
   own! He has died and lives again, no more to die!

   Out of the thick cloud of blackest grief which veils our dying Lord,
   there falls a silver shower of peace more refreshing than all the
   brooks of earth can yield--the certainty of our eternal life is proven
   by the certainty of Jesus' death! His blood is the blood of the
   Testament because it proves the testator's death. It is the blood of
   the Testament, again, because it is the seal of His being seized and
   possessed of those goods which He has bequeathed to us, for, apart from
   His Sacrifice, our Lord had no spiritual blessings to present to
   us--His death has filled the treasury of His Grace. He has pardon to
   bestow and

   justifying righteousness to give because He died! If He had not shed
   His blood, He would not have completed His part of the Covenant, nor
   have fulfilled the will of God. But when He died, with, "It is
   finished!" upon His lips, then His blood became the seal that Covenant
   mercies were His own and that they were His to leave to us. Oh treasure
   up the death of Jesus in your hearts, Believers, for, inasmuch as He
   has enriched you and given you all things necessary for this life of
   godliness, He has done this out of His own proper stores which were
   given Him as the reward of His passion!

   The blood of the Testament, again, is a direction as to His legatees.
   We see who are benefited under His will. To whom did Jesus Christ
   leave, by will, the blessings of Grace? He must have left them to the
   guilty because He has left a will that is signed and sealed in blood
   and blood is for the remission of sin. Jesus has made His testament in
   the character of a sin-atoning Sacrifice and we can only share in it by
   regarding Him under that character. If I am not a sinner, I have no
   interest in the legacy of a bleeding Redeemer! The blood-mark proves
   that the testament was made for those who need atonement by blood and
   that its legacies are bequeathed to sinners. This is one of the most
   humbling and yet most blessed of all the Truths of God. It casts down
   and yet lifts up!

   If I have any Grace or any Covenant blessing, it did not come to me
   because I was heir to it by nature, or because I had purchased it, or
   because of any intrinsic right in myself--but because Jesus, when He
   died, had a right to make His will as He pleased and He did so make it
   that He would give Himself and all that He had to such a poor, needy,
   empty, lost and guilty sinner as I am! Not because of any good in us do
   these blessings come to us, but all of our Lord's good will, who made
   the Testament of Love and sealed it with His heart's blood! Brethren,
   the legatees in Christ's will are those who come and accept His
   Atonement. There is nothing in Christ's will for any person who will
   not trust His blood. I know of no mercy under Heaven for any man who,
   knowing of the atoning Sacrifice, willfully refuses it!

   Certain teachers talk about a "larger hope." I read nothing of this
   fancy in the Scriptures and I dare not go beyond the Word of the Lord
   and I am content to say with Moses, "The secret things belong unto the
   Lord our God; but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to
   our children forever." "Other foundation can no man lay than that which
   is laid, which is Jesus Christ." Other hopes, large or small, I know
   not of from Revelation, except this one--"He that believes in Him is
   not condemned." "The blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses us from
   all sin." "He that believes in Him has everlasting life, but he that
   believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the
   name of the Only-Begotten Son

   of God."

   Thus, the blood of the Testament is a direction as to the legatees.
   And, as I said before, what an index it is of the value of the
   legacies, since even the seal upon the will is no less in value than
   the heart's blood of the heir of all things! What treasures must be
   ours under such a Covenant! What riches are yours and mine, my Brothers
   and Sisters, if we are really trusting in Jesus!

   III. But now, in the third place, I must speak for a minute or two upon
   that blood from another point of view. IT WAS THE BLOOD OF CLEANSING.
   "This is the blood of the Testament which God has enjoined unto you."
   Moses sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of
   the ministry--the object of the sprinkled blood was to purify so that
   the Book and the people and all things upon whom the blood fell might
   be allowed to stand in the Presence of the thrice holy God, being
   regarded by Him as cleansed. Think of this for a short time. This blood
   of the Covenant or of the Testament is a blood of purification to us.
   Wherever it is accepted by faith, it takes away all past guilt. Wonder
   of wonders! Years of sin vanish in a moment--encrustations of guilt
   disappear in a single instant and man, up to now guilty and
   con-demned--is rendered perfectly clean in God's sight and accepted in
   the Beloved because he believes in Christ Jesus!

   So priceless a Sacrifice as that of the Son of God is of boundless
   efficacy for the eternal removal of all evil once and for all. And this
   is but the beginning of our purification, for that same blood applied
   by faith takes away from the pardoned sinner the impurity which had
   been generated in his nature by habit. He ceases to love the sin which
   once he delighted in-- he begins to loathe that which was formerly his
   choice joy. A love of purity is born within his nature--he sighs to be
   perfect and he groans to think there should be about him tendencies
   towards evil. Temptations which once were welcomed are now resisted.
   Habits which were once most fascinating are an annoyance to his spirit.
   The precious blood, when it touches the conscience, removes all sense
   of guilt and when it touches the heart it kills the ruling power of
   sin!

   The more fully the power of the blood is felt, the more does it kill
   the power of sin within the soul. I hope you are feeling it to be so.
   We ought to be ashamed, Brothers and Sisters, if we allow those sins to
   conquer us, now, which overcame us years ago! We ought to possess a
   growing strength against iniquity, a growing abhorrence of everything
   that is evil and a

   growing likeness to Christ--and it will be so if this precious blood is
   really operating upon our nature and imparting to it a fullness of
   life--

   "The Cross once seen is death to e very vice Else He that died there
   suffered all His pain, Bled, groaned, agonized and died in vain." If
   you are in any measure failing as to holiness, fly to the blood for
   help! Perhaps you have not thought enough, of late, of the dying love
   of your Lord. His death has a living power about it to breed and
   nourish holiness within you. Remember there is no slaying sin but by
   nailing it to the Cross. Only the lance which pierced the heart of
   Jesus can kill the love of sin. You must overcome through the blood of
   the Lamb--there is no other way for victory!

   You will never avoid sin merely by believing it to be your duty to do
   so--the Law points the way, but cannot bear us along it. A sense of the
   great love of Christ to you in bearing your sin in His body on the
   Cross and so removing it from you will give you power to rise superior
   to temptation. It is charged against some of us, as preachers, that we
   do not urge men enough to their duties. We deny the charge and yet we
   claim that we do better, for we touch secret springs that nerve to duty
   and we point to the strength by which virtuous deeds are done! The
   acceptance of the Atonement is the great source of virtue. The Grace of
   God is seen in the Atonement of Jesus, by which sin is put away and
   thus the heart is won to God and led by gratitude to obey Him. The
   blood of Jesus is the strongest restraint from transgression.

   We say to the pardoned--Will you so dishonor the blood which cleanses
   you as to go and live in sin? Will you go back to that from which you
   have been redeemed by the death of your Savior? Will you roll, again,
   in that foul mire out of which Christ has lifted you and so do despite
   to the blood which cleanses you and make it to be to you as an unholy
   thing? It must not be! Let but the heart feel the power of the blood of
   Jesus and it will growingly aspire after holiness and increasingly seek
   it! The precious blood is our great security from backsliding, for by
   it we obtain daily access to God! It keeps the Christian from grievous
   relapses and preserves him unto the coming of his Lord. Wherever the
   blood of Jesus Christ is really applied, perfection must be its
   ultimate result. There will be battling and striving, but there must be
   victory before long! The holier a man becomes, the more he mourns over
   his unholiness.

   The operations of Grace in his soul make him detect the more readily
   the motions of sin in his members. There is not the sin within him that
   there was, but he sees that which is there more clearly and, therefore,
   he is more than ever grieved about it. No one calls himself so much a
   wretched man because sin is within him as he does who is also a
   thankful man, because God gives him the victory. You must not judge
   that you are not growing in sanctification because you are not
   increasing in your sense of it. Your sense of your own holiness is a
   poor test, a very doubtful index of your state. Brothers and Sisters,
   if you have really fixed your trust in the atoning blood and known its
   power, you are destined to perfection and all the devils in Hell cannot
   keep you from it! As sure as you believe, you shall one day stand
   white-robed among the host that know no discord in their song, no
   wandering in their walk!

   From this spot where I have preached the Word I must, as a Believer,
   rise to a higher spot where I shall prove the power of Jesus' blood in
   an immortality of perfection! And from that pew where you sit,
   believing in the precious blood, you, also, must pass onward through
   your pilgrimage until you, also, reach the fullness of eternal life,
   for your Lord has pledged Himself to keep all those whom the Father has
   given Him and you are among them if, indeed, you believe in Him! Those
   who are justified shall also be glorified! All Believers shall yet
   dwell at the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens where there is
   pleasure forevermore because there is perfection without alloy! May we
   all, through the Spirit, by the blood of purging be made whiter than
   snow!

   IV. And then, to close, it is THE BLOOD OF DEDICATION. On the day when
   Moses sprinkled the blood of the Covenant on the people and on the
   Book, it was meant to signify that they were a chosen people set apart
   unto God's service. The blood made them holiness unto the Lord. Moses
   stood upon an elevated place and took the scarlet wool and hyssop and
   sprinkled the blood on all sides. Try and realize a part of the scene,
   A man just beneath him is wearing a white robe and a spot of blood has
   fallen upon it. He sees it. There it is! Will he not prize the crimson
   sign? I would have preserved that robe as long as I lived and the blood
   spot, too!

   But what would it mean? To the Israelite it meant consecration to God.
   He would say, "The blood of the Covenant has fallen upon me and I am,
   therefore, a consecrated man dedicated to God." Now, unless the blood
   is upon you, my Brother or Sister, you are not saved! But if you are
   saved, you are, by that very fact, set apart to be God's servant. "You
   are not

   your own, you are bought with a price." "You were not redeemed with
   corruptible things as with silver and gold, but with the precious blood
   of Christ." A saved man is a bought man--the property of Jesus!
   Believer, not a hair on your head belongs to you--you belong to Jesus
   Christ as His servant as surely as you are redeemed by His blood! Now
   you are set apart! God's own mark is put upon you!

   You have believed--that believing has applied the blood to you and you
   are Christ's. Cannot you see the private token which the Lord has set
   on you? Do you not feel it? Oh, then, acknowledge its claims in your
   daily life! Being so set apart, you are, therefore, ordained with due
   solemnity to be a servant of God, even as Aaron and his sons were
   consecrated to their priesthood. I have been sometimes asked, "Were you
   ever ordained?" Yes, I was. Not by the laying on of the hands of any
   mortal man, but by that precious blood whose purchase-power I feel.
   When that blood fell upon me and I rejoiced in its cleansing power, I
   longed, at once, to tell of its efficacy to others. I hope I can say
   most honestly to my Lord--

   "Ever since by faith I saw the stream

   Your flowing wounds supply,

   Redeeming lo ve has been my theme,

   And shall be tiil I die!"

   That same blood has fallen on you, Brother, Sister, and it has ordained
   you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should
   remain. Is it not written, "You were slain and have been made unto our
   God kings and priests"? The slaying of Christ is the ground of our
   priesthood and the claim for our perpetual service. Let us praise,
   forever, the Lord who has worked everlasting redemption for us! If we
   have not Milton's power of song, at least let us come to the same
   resolve at which he arrived--

   "O unexampled love! Lo ve no where to be found less than Divine!

   Hail, Son of God, Savior of men, Your name

   Shall be the copious matter of my song

   Henceforth and never shall my harp Your praise

   Forget, nor from Your Father's praise disjoin." Because of all this we
   are to lead a separated life. It is not for us to live as others live
   who walk in the vanity of their minds. We are not to seek the world's
   pleasures. We are not to besmear ourselves with its folly and its
   selfishness. God's people, if they act as they should, are a separated
   people. It is written, "The people shall dwell alone, they shall not be
   numbered among the nations." The Lord has set apart him that is godly
   for Himself and as the shepherd marks his sheep, so, with the precious
   blood of Christ applied by faith, has God marked His own elect, that
   they should abide in Christ and go no more out, no more mingling with
   the sons of men, nor joying in their joys, nor serving their lusts.

   The Lord's portion is His people and His cry to them is, " Come you out
   from among them and be you separate." God give you to feel this blood
   of the Covenant, this blood of the Testament, this blood of cleansing,
   this blood of the setting apart, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.

The Believer Catechized

   (No. 1568)

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 21, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Do you believe this?" John 11:26.

   THE Savior said to Martha, "I am the resurrection and the life: He that
   believes in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whoever
   lives and believes in Me shall never die. DO YOU BELIEVE THIS?" When
   Believers are sorrowful, they may be assured that a consolation is
   provided exactly adapted to their cases. For every lock that God has
   made, He has provided a key. As every blade of grass has its own drop,
   so every grief has its comfort. I doubt not that for every pain which
   racks this mortal frame there is a pain reliever among the herbs of the
   fields and for every disease there is a remedy in God's wondrous
   laboratory if we could but find it.

   As for us who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, we may rest assured
   that if we are borne down by excessive sorrow, it is almost always our
   own fault and arises from a defect in our faith--for if our faith were
   as strong as it ought to be, we would "take pleasure in infirmities, in
   reproaches and in distresses for Christ's sake." We would find that as
   our tribulations abounded, so would our consolations abound by Christ
   Jesus. It will be well, therefore, when we are greatly distressed, not
   so much to look to the apparent cause of the present trouble as at the
   condition of our own hearts--it will be wise to inquire where our faith
   is lacking and what it may be which prevents our laying hold upon the
   comfort provided for the present distress.

   It frequently happens that our faith is defective because of slender
   knowledge. A man cannot believe what he does not know. My dear, tried
   Friend, there is a promise in the Scriptures which would exactly meet
   your case and, if grasped by faith, it would immediately cheer you! But
   you know nothing of its efficacy because you may never yet have read
   it, or, having read it, you may never have paused over it and
   considered its meaning and so you are needlessly distressed because
   your relief lies close at hand. It may be that as yet you have not
   learned the whole circle of Gospel doctrines and this, also, deprives
   you of comfort. You have laid hold upon the vital and saving part of
   Revelation, but the strengthening and exhilarating part of it you know
   not.

   You have fed on the necessary bread of Christ's house, but not upon the
   luscious fruits of His garden! You have been in the field, but you have
   not walked in the garden to eat His pleasant fruit. Faith cannot
   believe what it does not know and, therefore, you have missed fat
   things full of marrow and wines on the lees well-refined which might
   have been your strength and your joy. We would, all of us, grow in
   comfort if we grew in Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior
   Jesus Christ and had a more intelligent appreciation of the
   preciousness of the Truths of God which He has revealed! Faith may be
   defective through ignorance and it may also be defective through a lack
   of appreciation of the Person of Christ. It was so in Martha's
   case--she did not know enough about her Lord to perceive His power to
   meet her sorrow.

   The Apostle Paul says, in the passage which I just now quoted, "Grow in
   Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ," as if
   the knowledge of Jesus were, indeed, the most important and gracious
   knowledge which a Believer can obtain and so it is! If we are but half
   instructed as to our Lord, we shall be but half-comforted. O mourners,
   you have not rated the Savior highly enough! You have not yet a large
   enough idea of His love for you and of His design of Infinite Wisdom in
   permitting you to be afflicted. If the Lord Jesus were better known,
   our afflictions would be lightened and our hearts would even rejoice in
   them! If we did but know You, O blessed Christ, then if the same trials
   remained with us they would lose their gloom beneath Your smile and we
   would even come to rejoice in them as ministering to our fellowship
   with You in Your sufferings! Jesus known, sorrow loses its
   sting--surely even the bitterness of death is past!

   It is not to be supposed that every true Believer in Christ is
   assuredly a perfect Believer. Martha truly believed in Jesus, but she
   did not perfectly believe in Him. I do not know how many here have, or
   think they have, perfect faith--such good people will get very little
   from the discourse of this morning--but then, happily, they do not need
   it! Those of us who have

   an imperfect faith--and I suspect that this would describe most of
   us--may gather instruction from the Savior's question to Martha, "Do
   you believe this?" May the Holy Spirit cause it to be so. Let us think
   we hear His loving lips enquiring of us at this time concerning this
   Truth and the other--"Do you believe this?"

   We desire to believe everything that is true and we wish to receive
   into our minds every doctrine which the Holy Spirit has revealed, for
   we would perfect our discipleship and is not this one of its
   privileges--"When He, the Spirit of Truth, is come, He shall guide you
   into all Truth"? We long to believe everything that is within the range
   of our spiritual knowledge, so that our faith, taking the entire range
   of Divine Truth, may be complete for every emergency and mighty in
   every conflict. Submit, then, to a heart-searching enquiry as to your
   faith and hear Jesus say, by His Spirit, "Do you believe

   this?"

   I. Our first head will be--DO YOU BELIEVE THIS PARTICULAR DOCTRINE? I
   will not just now suggest any one doctrine above another, but merely
   advise your putting the question about every revealed Truth of God. You
   who are Believers have faith in the Scriptures in general. You can
   boldly declare that from the first word of Genesis to the last word of
   Revelation you believe all that is written in the Inspired volume. Now,
   the point is to take out of this general mass of things believed, or
   supposed to be believed, each one separate item and look it over in
   detail and then say with your heart and conscience, "I believe this."

   It is easy to talk in the whole and it is very easy to think that we
   have a vast amount of faith and yet we may have little or none worth
   having! We may have put the treasure of the Truths of God into a bag
   that is full of holes and so may have lost it as fast as we have found
   it. We may fancy that we embrace within our arms the whole of revealed
   Truth and yet, when we come to a quiet examination of our soul, we may
   find that much is slipping away from us by a process of questions and
   doubts which we hardly dare acknowledge! Things believed and never used
   are like a sluggard's farm which lies fallow and is never tilled--we
   hardly call such ground a farm and can we call such belief real faith?
   Why, some Truths of God taught in the Word are not even known by
   numbers of professors and we cannot believe what we do not know! It is
   the same case as that supposed in the Apostle's question, "How shall
   they believe in Him when they have not heard?" If we do not see the
   surface meaning--which is within our reach--we cannot be said to
   believe in any real sense.

   Martha, when our Savior questioned her, had already expressed her faith
   in certain great Truths of God. She said, "Lord, if You had been here,
   my brother had not died." She believed in the Savior's power to heal
   the sick. She believed that so long as her brother breathed, the power
   of Christ could have kept him alive. She was convinced that Jesus was
   the Master of disease and could restore the suffering to health. This
   was something worthy of her faith, but it was not enough. Our Lord set
   a further fact before her and asked, "Do you believe this?" It is for
   us to grow in knowledge and to exercise faith in proportion as we do
   so.

   Next, Martha believed that though her brother was dead, such was the
   efficacy of Christ's prayer that He could do something. She does not
   quite say what, to comfort the bereaved--"I know, that even now,
   whatever You will ask of God, God will give it You." She had faith in
   our Lord's prevalence with God in prayer and that to an unlimited
   degree. She believed in Jesus as a mighty Intercessor, One who had but
   to speak with the Most High and His request would surely be
   an-swered--this is a very commendable measure of faith--I wish that we
   all had as much! So much faith was something admirable, but it was not
   enough for her present comfort and, therefore, Jesus puts before her a
   fact even more honorable to Himself and then adds, "Do you believe
   this?"

   Martha also expressed her firm conviction as to the certainty of the
   general Resurrection--"I know that my brother shall rise again in the
   Resurrection at the Last Day." She had gathered this, doubtless, from
   the Old Testament Scriptures and from the general belief among orthodox
   Hebrews. She may also have learned this master Truth of God from the
   teaching of the Savior, Himself. She was, in this great fundamental
   doctrine, a thoroughly sound believer, but she had not yet seen the
   Resurrection in the Christian light and perceived our Lord's connection
   with it. She had not yet learned enough to afford her comfort under her
   heavy loss, for it is clear that she derived very little consolation
   from the fact of a distant and general Resurrection--she needed
   resurrection and life to come nearer home and to become more a present
   fact to her.

   Our Savior points her to a Truth concerning Himself which would answer
   that purpose and says to her, "I am the Resurrection and the Life: he
   that believes in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and
   whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?"
   Here was a well of comfort from which she had never drank, because,
   like Hagar in the wilderness, she had never seen the Divine supply!
   Christ points her to it and asks her if she will not drink. I would to
   God,

   dear Friends, that all of us who call ourselves Christians would, every
   now and then, go over the Bible and rehearse the great doctrines, in
   order, before our minds. We need to stop at each one of them and ask
   our heart and mind, "Do you believe this?"

   Take, for instance, that great and earliest of doctrines, the Election
   of Grace. "Whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be
   conformed to the image of His Son." "Blessed be the God and Father of
   our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings
   in heavenly places in Christ; according as He has chosen us in Him
   before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without
   blame before Him in love: having predestinated us unto the adoption of
   children by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of
   His will." Pause over these texts and consider their evident meaning
   and then say to your own hearts, "Do you believe this?"

   Some believers in Christ do not attempt to accept this doctrine and
   even call it horrible! And others speak of it as so mysterious and
   unpractical that it is not to be preached in public! I would invite
   such, honestly, to look the doctrine in the face and see whether they
   believe it or not, for if they do not, they may as well take a pen and
   cross out of the Word of God all passages which plainly teach it! They
   would not want to do this and yet they do that which amounts to the
   same thing! When a man is afraid of a doctrine--or ashamed of it--has
   grave cause to suspect that he does not believe it!

   Take another grand Truth of God--"A man is justified by faith and not
   by the works of the Law." "Being justified by faith, we have peace with
   God through our Lord Jesus Christ." "He that believes in Him is not
   condemned." The perfect pardon of the Believer--the complete justifying
   power of the righteousness of Christ to them that believe is plainly
   taught in the Bible--"Do you believe this?" If you do, why do you go
   every day and perpetually call yourself a "miserable sinner," when you
   are so no longer, but a blood-washed saint and a happy child of God?
   Why do you talk about your sin as if it were not forgiven and speak of
   yourself as if you were still "an heir of wrath, even as others,"
   whereas you are justified in Christ Jesus and accepted in the Beloved?
   Look at the Scriptural Truth of God and at your conduct and then say to
   your-

   self, "Do you believe this?"

   Suppose you turn to the Scriptures and read of the union of Christ to
   His people, "I in them and You in Me, that they may be made perfect in
   one." "I am the vine, you are the branches." When you thus read,
   inquire of your heart, "Do you believe this?" Do you believe that all
   who live unto God are one with Christ? Do you believe this? If so, why
   are you troubled as to your acceptance with God since you are one with
   Christ? Why do you think that you shall ultimately perish if you are
   one with Him? Will Christ lose the members of His body? Shall it be
   that one after another the limbs of His mystical frame shall rot away
   and die? Has He not said, "Because I live you shall live also"? "Do you
   believe this?"

   It may be that Brothers and Sisters will say of a certain Truth of God
   that this is a high doctrine, or a mysterious doctrine which seems
   almost too good to be true--but all this is wide of the mark. The one
   question is--Is it revealed? "King Agrippa," said Paul, "Do you believe
   the Prophets? I know that you believe." So would I say to each one of
   you--if you believe the Prophets and the Apostles, why do you not
   believe, one by one, those great Truths of God which He has spoken by
   them? And if you believe them to be revealed, how dare you cast a slur
   upon them as being this, that and the other? I will not ask you to
   believe my statement, nor the statements of theologians and divines,
   but turn to the Infallible Book, itself, and see what is written there
   and then ask yourself, "Do you believe this?"

   As you meet with such-and-such a statement of Holy Writ, do not cut it
   down or quibble at it, nor twist it, nor try to see if some eminent
   commentator has not evaporated the very soul out of it! But believe it
   just as you find it and if you cannot do so, stop until you can and cry
   out to God for further Light till you can, without hesitation, answer
   the Savior's question and say, with Martha, "Yes, Lord." How this
   enquiry, well managed and pressed home, will enlarge the range of
   faith! How it will strengthen its grasp and hold! How rich would our
   souls become! Upon what meat would our inward confidence be fed if we
   would but treasure up each crumb of revealed Truth!

   Search the Scriptures and take the teaching of the Word of God in
   detail, line by line and word by word--and then ask your soul, "Do you
   believe this?" Ask for an anointing from the Holy One that you may know
   all things and understand with all saints what are the heights and
   depths and know the love of Christ which passes knowledge. There will
   be profit connected with this, our first point, if each one will
   conscientiously catechize his mind and say, "Do you believe this
   particular doctrine of the Word?"

   II. Our next division shall be briefly handled. DO YOU BELIEVE THIS
   DISTINCT DOCTRINE? I find, especially

   among members of certain churches, great cloudiness as to their faith.
   I would not judge severely, but I notice that those

   converted persons who come to us from certain quarters, which I will
   not now name, believe the Gospel, but it is too much after the manner
   of the collier in the old story. When he was asked, "What do you
   believe?" He answered, "I believe as the church believes." He was then
   questioned, "But what does the church believe?" He replied, "The church
   believes what I believe." Being further asked, "And what do you and the
   church believe?" He answered, "We both believe the same thing."

   There was no getting further with him. Is not this kind of faith common
   enough at this day? Many who are called Christians have this blind
   faith and little more. This doting faith, in you know not what, is more
   fit for idiots than rational beings! Let those delight in it who are of
   slavish mind, or too idle to think for themselves. As for us, so long
   as we have eyes we shall not yield to walk blindfolded! We like a man
   to do his own thinking. Put your garments out to wash, if you please,
   but your thinking, you should do at home. There is no reaching the land
   of the Truth of God unless you will work your passage by thinking over
   the teaching of the Lord.

   What I tell you, you may believe or not at your pleasure. But I beseech
   you, do not accept it for any other reason than that in your own
   judgment it is in accordance with the mind of God as unveiled in Holy
   Writ. God has given to each man a judgment and a conscience and an
   understanding--and these, the owner of them is bound to use! The Light
   of God is not given to all alike and hence the use of guides to such as
   have not great knowledge. But it can only be seen by a man's own eyes
   and he cannot look at objects by proxy. By experience some men have
   learned far more than others and hence they are useful helpers. But
   still, no man's experience of Grace can stand instead of my own--each
   one must feel and know the Divine Life in his own soul. As food must be
   masticated and digested by each man for the sustenance of his own body,
   so must the Truth of God be read, marked, learned and inwardly digested
   by each man for the sustenance of his own soul.

   The church of Rome says, "Yield an implicit faith to the church"--this
   is a fine platform for priestcraft and you see through the scheme in a
   minute! But we say the very reverse and charge you not to believe a
   single word that any one of us, or all of us put together, shall say to
   you if it is contrary to the Word of God! Read that Word for yourselves
   and search the Scriptures to see whether these things are so or not,
   for so did the Bereans of old and they were noble because of it and you
   shall be noble if you rise to the dignity of your manhood and, by the
   help of God, use your own sense and understanding and pray for the
   teaching of His Spirit that you may know what the Truth of God is.

   Our Savior puts a certain Truth before good Martha in distinct terms.
   He left the general haze of the Resurrection in which she believed and
   said, "I who stand before you am the Resurrection and the Life. Do you
   believe this?" Do you believe the doctrine put in this clear form and
   shape? He gave her crisp, sharp, definite teaching and said, "Do you
   believe this?" He brought before her mental vision not an impalpable,
   shadowy image and specter of truth, but a solid, substantial statement
   that He, Himself, was the Resurrection and the Life, raising those who
   believe in Him from the dead and keeping in life those who, being
   alive, believe in Him. And then He demanded--"Do you believe this?"

   A great many persons see doctrines in a kind of dim, hazy light and in
   that "darkness visible" they exercise a sort of faith, but they will
   never get comfort out of the Truth of God in that fashion. We must
   believe revealed Truth as we see it, in its own clear, well defined and
   accurate form as Scripture shows it. For instance, the doctrine of the
   Atonement is robbed of half its delight if indistinctly stated.
   Thousands of Christians believe in a kind of atonement, a means of
   reconciliation, a sort of propitiation made by Christ, which, in some
   way or other brings us to God. But, Beloved, I would have you believe
   that, "He, His own self bore our sins in His own body on the tree."
   "The Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all." Do you believe this?

   "He has made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be
   made the righteousness of God in Him." Do you believe this? Read the
   53rd chapter of Isaiah, in which you have Substitution set forth most
   clearly. Yes, read the chapter through and pause over such a verse as
   the 11th, "He shall see of the travail of His soul and shall be
   satisfied: by His knowledge shall My righteous Servant justify many;
   for He shall bear their iniquities." And then put it to yourself--Do
   you believe this? The very life and soul and sweetness of Atonement
   will be found in the Substitution of the innocent Savior for the guilty
   sinner in the actual bearing of the penalty of sin, the real payment of
   the debt--for then I know that I am clear, because He, in my place, has
   vindicated Justice, honored the Law and glorified God! Do you believe
   this?

   Dear Friend, ask God to give you Grace that you may believe in what
   Christ has taught and what the Prophets and the Apostles have spoken
   exactly as it was meant that you should believe it, not in a haphazard,
   unreal way, but with your whole heart and soul and mind, accepting
   God's Word as it stands, in all its clearly cut lines and features.
   Have a quick and

   true answer to the question, "Do you believe this distinct and clear
   Truth of God?" Pray to be able to answer, by His

   Grace, "Yes, Lord!"

   III. We will now go a little further, in the third place, to ask, "DO
   YOU BELIEVE THIS DIFFICULT TRUTH?" Certain Truths of God are hard to
   grasp. There are points about them which almost stagger faith till
   faith rises to her true character and is no longer dwarfed into carnal
   reasoning! But these difficult things are to be believed. It was not
   easy for Martha to understand how the Lord Jesus could, Himself, be the
   Resurrection and the Life and yet her brother was dead. It was not an
   easy Truth for her to believe, for it is not easy for us. How can he
   that died be alive? How can the Son of Man have such a wonderful power
   that resurrection and life should be entirely dependent upon Him? How
   can these things be?

   We know the fact, but we do not understand it. It is well for us if we
   do not need to understand it, but regard it as sufficient for us to
   believe what is revealed even though, to our reason, it may seem a
   fathomless deep. Indeed, it was difficult for Martha to believe her
   Lord to be the Life because it seemed contrary to her experience.
   "Though he were dead, yet shall he live." She might hope that this was
   possible in the case of Lazarus, but then the Lord had said, "He that
   lives and believes in Me shall never die." How could that be true?
   Lazarus lived and believed in Jesus and yet he had died! Her experience
   seemed to be contrary to Christ's statement and this might have
   rendered it difficult to believe and, therefore, the Lord asked, "Do
   you believe this?"

   But, my Brothers and Sisters, when we become Christians we cease to
   consider difficulties of belief, for we take the Scriptures upon Divine
   authority and submit ourselves implicitly to their teaching. At any
   rate, I have done so. What their church is to the Romanists, that is
   what the Bible and the Holy Spirit are to me! This done, no difficulty
   remains one-half so great as those which I have surmounted! I believed,
   first of all, that God was in Christ--that He who made the heavens and
   the earth came down below and took upon Himself human nature, was born
   at Bethlehem, was cradled in a manger and did suck His nourishment from
   a woman's breast. After having believed that, I can believe anything!
   An Incarnate God, once accepted, no difficulty need stagger my faith!

   Martha's speech--"I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God,
   which should come into the world"--proved her readiness to believe all
   else that Jesus might teach. The Incarnation, to begin with--without
   which believing a man can be no Christian at all--is so profound a
   mystery that other teachings are simple in its presence! "Without
   controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the
   flesh." Once rejoice in the Light of God, which is the very daystar of
   hope to us--that God has taken into union with Himself our human
   nature--and you are ready for all Light! Only let me know that God says
   anything is true and that is enough for me!

   I do not quite join with the poor old woman in her words, but I agree
   with her spirit, who put her implicit faith in Scripture in the most
   unguarded way, when someone ridiculed her for believing that the whale
   swallowed Jonah. "Dear," she said, "if the Word of God had said that
   Jonah swallowed the whale I would have believed it." Brothers and
   Sisters, prostrate yourselves before the utterance of God! Not before
   man's dictum or dogma! Not before the utterance of priest, presbyter,
   pastor, or philosopher! But before God, who cannot err, we prostrate
   our souls! In Him you must place implicit faith. Let Him say what He
   wills, we must believe it and that not in one case or 20, but in all
   that He says. "Do you believe this?"--and this?--and this? Whatever it
   is?

   Yes, if it is, indeed, taught in Infallible Scripture by the Holy
   Spirit of God, we believe it! If your faith does not rise to this mark,
   evil will happen to it. Our Lord said, one day, to a company of those
   who were His followers, "Except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and
   drink His blood, you have no life in you. For My flesh is meat, indeed,
   and My blood is drink, indeed. He that eats My flesh and drinks My
   blood dwells in Me and I in him." What followed? Read on. "Many,
   therefore, of His disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an
   hard saying; who can bear it? From that time many of His disciples went
   back and walked no more with Him."

   They said, "Can this Man give us His flesh to eat?" and they came to
   the conclusion that it could not be and deserted their Teacher. Do we
   wish to do this? The Lord Jesus Christ, at the very outset of His
   ministry, prepares us to believe hard things. He bids us count the cost
   about this as well as everything else. Although we already believe
   certain mysteries, there are many more that we do not know of as yet
   which will, in due course, demand our faith. Did not Jesus say to
   Nicodemus when Nicodemus had been told of being born again and that had
   staggered him, "If I have told you earthly things and you believe not,
   how shall you believe if I tell you of heavenly things?" As if even
   regeneration, which is really full of heavenli-ness, were but a
   commonplace Truth of God compared with what Nicodemus had yet to
   believe!

   If Nicodemus had said, "Good Master, I can go as far as this, but I
   reserve my judgment and shall venture no further," then the ruler of
   the Jews and the Son of God would have parted, for he cannot be
   Christ's disciple who will not receive all Christ's words--let those
   words be what they may. Do you believe this, then? This difficult Truth
   of God? I put this very earnestly to some of you because it may be that
   at this moment you are in trouble from lack of faith in a promise or a
   doctrine which seems hard to you. You have a promise, "When you pass
   through the fire you shall not be burned, neither shall the flame
   kindle upon you." Do you believe this, though all things appear to be
   consumed in the heat of your affliction?

   It may be that you are under a peculiar cloud and dense gloom and yet
   Jesus declares, "I am the Light of the world, he that follows me shall
   not walk in darkness, but shall have the Light of life." And, again,
   "Whoever believes Me shall not abide in darkness." Do you believe this?
   Can you laugh at impossibility and say it shall be done because God has
   said it? Do you not know that things impossible with men are possible
   with God? Can your faith leap over the head of carnal reason? Can
   present circumstances and the deductions of your own judgment all be
   waved aside by the left hand as you say, "Let God be true and every man
   a liar"? If so, you have the faith which will comfort and bless you!
   But if not, like Martha, you will be bowed down with sorrow since you
   have not yet believed the Truth of God which can cheer you.

   IV. Fourthly, to pass on--"Do you believe this?" that is, DO YOU
   BELIEVE THIS TRUTH AS IT STANDS CONNECTED WITH JESUS? I called your
   attention, just now, to the fact that Martha believed that there would
   be a resurrection. "Yes," says Christ, "but I am the Resurrection. Do
   you believe this?" Now it is one thing to believe doctrine, but it is
   another thing to believe that doctrine as it is embodied in the Person
   of Jesus Christ. "Do you believe this?" There the comfort lies--in
   believing the Truth of God as you find it in Him who is the Truth of
   God! Martha was called upon to believe, first, in Christ's personal
   power. "The dead will rise." "True, Martha, but do you believe that I
   shall make them rise--that it is through Me the dead shall live? Yes,
   that I am the Life and Resurrection? Do you believe that?"

   She was to believe, moreover, in His present power. Mark that. "Even
   now," says Jesus, "I am the Resurrection and the Life; he that lives
   and believes in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live and whoever
   lives and believes in Me, shall never die." It is one thing to believe
   that Jesus will have power at the Last Day to raise the dead--but do we
   believe that He is, even now, the Resurrection and the Life? Oh the
   bliss of believing in the personal power of Christ and in the present
   power of Christ! Jesus, the I AM, says, "I am the Resurrection and the
   Life."

   Moreover, Martha was called on to believe in the union of Christ with
   His people--that they are one with Him, that they are partakers of His
   life, that if they should come under the power of death they should be
   delivered out of it and that being out of the power of death they shall
   never come under it--in Christ the dead shall live, the living shall
   not die. "Oh," says one, "but I myself do not comprehend this, for I
   see good people die." Yes, you see what you think is death, but they do
   not truly die--they rise into a higher life. That which is the essence
   of death never touches Believers--they "depart out of the world unto
   the Father." They go "to be with Christ, which is far better"--they do
   not die! Death as a penal sentence, in its innermost meaning, never
   comes near to those for whom Jesus has borne death upon the Cross! His
   death, in their place, is the death of Death to them. Do you believe
   this?

   Come now, let us each one ask, Do I really believe that Christ Jesus
   has all power in Heaven and in earth? Do I worship Him as God over all,
   blessed forever? Do I believe He is able to do exceeding abundantly
   above all that I ask or even think? And when I come in prayer before
   God, do I so believe in Christ that I remember His promise, "Whatever
   you shall ask the Father in My name I will give to you"? Not the
   Father, but Jesus! Even Christ Himself will give you all things! Have
   you such a notion and idea of your Lord that you know that He can do
   all things for you right now and, that in answer to your prayer He can
   grant you any blessing and save you out of any trouble and every
   trouble--do you believe this? If you do not you have no right idea of
   Christ, for He is Lord of all. "You are the King of Glory, O Christ,"
   and as such we do believe in You and trust You and find comfort in Your
   present, personal power!

   V. We must now pass on to a fifth head. Do you believe this?--that is
   to say, DO YOU BELIEVE THIS TRUTH

   WHICH IS APPLICABLE TO YOURSELF NOW? That was the point with Martha and
   this was the place wherein she fell

   short. She believed that all would rise. But Jesus virtually says--"Do
   you believe that I am the Resurrection and the Life, because if it is
   so, I am able to raise your brother at once--do you believe this?" Now,
   observe that we sometimes believe great Truths of God and yet we are
   staggered by lesser Truths because, it may be, the great Truth has no
   practical bearing upon us just now, while the present Truth, though it
   is somewhat less in other respects, has a greater practical bearing
   upon ourselves and our condition.

   We doubt the promise most necessary to our comfort! For look, she
   believes that all will rise--well, then, it was a much smaller thing to
   believe that one would rise! She doubts whether Lazarus can rise
   because he is in the grave, yet she believes that millions upon
   millions will rise from the ground. Doubtless that was because of the
   distance of the time and the scene. Some such feeling must have
   operated on her mind, for the general Resurrection is the greater
   difficulty. Is it hard to believe that Lazarus can rise who has been
   dead four days? Well, then, it is a great deal harder to believe that
   bodies can be quickened which have been dead several hundreds of years!
   Yet she did believe that the dead would rise at the Resurrection at the
   Last Day--not only those who were stinking, but those whose bodies had
   been dissolved by corruption and scattered by the four winds of heaven
   to the utmost ends of the earth!

   She believed the miracle on a grand scale, so she said, but when it
   came home to one person who had only been dead four days she could not
   believe it! She believed that there should be a general Resurrection of
   all sorts of people and yet, if that can be believed, it is much easier
   to expect that a favorite of Christ like Lazarus should rise! Jesus
   loved Lazarus-- surely He will call him from the tomb! I say she
   professed to believe the larger Truth of God and then she staggered at
   the lesser because it was applicable to herself. I beg you to see
   whether you are not often walking in the same path. Yonder is a poor
   soul who believes that Jesus Christ can wash away all sin. Now, my dear
   Friend, do you believe that He can wash your sins away?

   That is the point because all the sins of millions are much greater
   than yours can be and if Jesus can take away the sins of so many,
   surely He can take away yours! Do you believe this? Will you come and
   trust Him for yourself? And you, Christian, you believe, in general,
   that all things work together for good to those who love God--do you
   believe that all your ills, little and great, are working good for you?
   Will that toothache of yours work for your good? Do you believe that
   yesterday's bad debt will work for good? Do you believe that the death
   of your child will work for good? You know it must be easier to believe
   that the events of one day will work for good than to believe that all
   things in the world throughout life will do so and yet it may be you
   are staggered at your present trials and you confess your misgivings!

   Have you faith in everything but that which would comfort you? Have you
   everything but the special requirement of the hour? How odd! How sad
   that the carpenter needs to drive a nail and he has all his tools with
   him except his hammer! What is he to do? What is the good of all his
   other tools? If you can believe everything except the Truth of God
   which would cheer you at this present moment, you are depriving
   yourself of comfort and strength! Believe this present promise given
   for this very day--the Lord has said, "I will never leave you nor
   forsake you." Do you believe this? "Underneath are the everlasting
   arms." Do you believe this?

   "Your shoes shall be iron and brass, and as your days so shall your
   strength be." Do you believe this? God's Word is as the Tree of Life
   which yields its fruit every month. What a blessing to take the fruit
   from the Tree of Life in its month just when it is ripest and full of
   flavor. He has said, "Delight yourself, also, in the Lord and He will
   give you the desire of your heart." Since you delight in Him, He will
   hear your prayer and give you the light of His Countenance. "Do you
   believe

   this?"

   VI. The last point shall be this--DO YOU BELIEVE THIS PRACTICAL TRUTH?
   Martha said that she believed it. But her actions did not prove it. She
   comprehended the belief in the Lord's word in her declaration, "Yes,
   Lord, I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, which should
   come into the world." But yet she did not believe so as to act on the
   belief. Coleridge says, "Truths, of all others the most awful and
   mysterious and at the same time of universal interest, are too often
   considered as so true that they lose all the power of truth and lie
   bed-ridden in the dormitory of the soul, side by side with the most
   despised and exploded errors."

   How true is the remark! Do you not know people who are better than
   their creed? Why is that? Why, for the very same reason that many
   people are worse than their creed, because their creed is asleep and is
   not operating upon them--they believe as though they did not believe!
   This is a poor imitation of faith. There is, at this moment, a house on
   fire in London. I will suppose that I know the fact and tell you of it
   and you believe it. But what do you care? Not one of you stirs. Yes,
   but if you saw the engine hurrying along the street and believed that
   your own house was blazing, I guarantee you, you would bestir
   yourselves!

   Your belief would come a little more home to you as your own concern.
   So there are certain Truths of God which do not seem to concern us to
   any high degree, at least for the present. They are true and important,
   but they operate no more upon us than if they were fictions. Martha
   says she believes in Jesus as the Resurrection and the Life, yet what
   is her action?

   Christ commands the bystanders to take away the stone from the
   sepulcher and she interposes with her cry, "Lord, by this time he
   stinks!" She fears the obnoxious consequences of uncovering such a mass
   of corruption, though He who is the Resurrection and the Life stands at
   the grave's mouth! Ah, Martha, where is your faith in Him? Dear heart,
   she says that she believes in Jesus as the Resurrection and the Life
   and yet she is afraid that her brother will not rise though the Mighty
   One stands there to raise him!

   Is she not just like you and I? We believe that God hears prayer and,
   therefore, we pray. But if the Lord desires to surprise us, He has only
   to answer our requests! I have seen God's children running with vast
   astonishment to tell their friends, "Here is a wonderful thing! Oh,
   such a marvelous event has happened to me! I offered a prayer and God
   has heard me." An amazing thing that God should do as He said He would?
   They put these things in books as marvels and call the volume,
   "Remarkable Answers to Prayer." Dear me, is it remarkable that it is
   cold when it freezes? Do we speak of the remarkable warmth of the sun's
   beams at midsummer? Is it remarkable that the fires in our houses
   should warm us when we put our hands to them? Is He a remarkable God
   because He says He will hear prayer and does? An answer to prayer
   should be remembered with gratitude and yet it should regarded as the
   most natural thing in all the world that our heavenly Father should
   fulfill His promises to His children.

   It is a great wonder that God should promise, but not a wonder that He
   should perform. It is marvelous that God should promise to hear prayer,
   but no wonder at all that when He has promised to do so He is as good
   as His Word. Brothers and Sisters, we are, to a great degree,
   unpractical in other respects, also, and we may take up many and many a
   Truth of God that we do not act upon and say to our heart, "Do you
   believe this?" Might I not step outside the door, this morning, and,
   putting my hand upon a fainting Believer as he left the house say, "Do
   you believe your God?" You say, "I am so faint in spirit that I shall
   utterly fall and perish at the last." But the Lord has said, "He gives
   power to the faint and to them that have no might, He increases
   strength." Do you believe this?

   I might go to another who is sighing and crying because of his poverty
   and say to him, "God has said, 'No good thing will He withhold from
   them that walk uprightly.' Do you believe this?" What would the
   complainer say? How could he reconcile his discomfort and his murmuring
   with his belief in the comforting promise? My Brothers and Sisters, let
   us, then, go over these matters with our souls. We call ourselves
   Believers, but are we? If it is so that one after another we doubt the
   precious things of God when they come before us in detail, where is our
   faith? Let us entreat our God to grant us Divine Grace that we may put
   our finger on this doctrine, on that promise and on the other assurance
   and say of each one, "Lord, I believe this, and I believe this, and I
   believe this--for I believe whatever You say in Your Word and I know
   that it shall be even as You have told me."

   God bless you, Beloved, and be always with you for Christ's sake. Amen.

The Golden Lamp and Its Goodly Lessons

   (No. 1569)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And the angel that talked with me came again and awakened me, as a man
   that is wakened out of his sleep and said unto me, What do you see? And
   I said, I have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl
   upon the top of it and it has seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to
   the seven lamps, which are upon the top: and two olive trees by it, one
   upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side. And I
   answered again and said unto him, What are these two olive branches
   which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of
   themselves? And he answered me and said, Don't you know what these are?
   And I said, No, my lord. Then he said, These are the two anointed ones
   that stand by the Lord of the whole earth." Zechariah 4:1-3; 12-14.

   THE Prophet, as he tells us in the introduction to His vision, had to
   be awakened by the angel as one is awakened out of his sleep. His mind
   was dull and heavy. Perhaps he was weary and worn out. Do you not often
   feel a similar lethargy from which you need to be awakened before your
   mind is equal to the study of those Truths which God is revealing to
   your soul? May it not, then, be well, at the commencement of our
   meditation, to pray the Lord to awaken us as a man is awakened out of
   his sleep? A divinely mysterious power can brood over us and quicken us
   out of lethargy. Have you ever felt it? "Or ever I was aware my soul
   made me like the chariots of Amminadib." I had been slow before, but
   when the Spirit came, then was fulfilled that ancient proverb, "Draw me
   and I will run after You."

   The touch of the Holy Spirit makes our faculties strong, our powers of
   thought are greatly enlarged and we get the key to mysteries which we
   never had been able to unlock before. Come, blessed Spirit, then, to
   each one of Your slumbering children at this good hour and awaken us,
   that we may see what You would set before us! Like young Samuel, whom
   You called in his sleep, we would, each one, heartily say, " Speak,
   Lord, for Your servant hears."

   Beloved Friends, we live in a world which is naturally shrouded in
   darkness. The "Prince of this world," "the Prince of the power of the
   air" is a dark spirit loving ignorance and sin! This darkness hovers
   over all the world as it did over Egypt--a darkness that might be felt
   is upon the souls of men! We sometimes fear that this gloom will
   thicken into an awful midnight. When we mix up with men in the ordinary
   avocations of life and hear their profane language; when we see the
   angry passions, the earthly propensities and the worldly policies that
   prevail among people who are held in repute among their fellow
   creatures, if we are children of God we cannot fail to be distressed
   that the world should still be so benighted and so destitute of that
   knowledge which purifies the heart.

   Nearly 1,900 years have passed since the blessed feet of our Divine
   Master touched this globe and yet it still smokes beneath the hoof of
   the Wicked One! The sun has risen on this Egypt and yet a miserable
   midnight covers the guilty people. We are apt, therefore, to become
   somewhat desponding, lest the Light of the knowledge of God should
   gradually wane--till at length it shall utterly die out. What, then,
   would become of the world? If the one golden candlestick were taken out
   of its place--if those who are the light of the world should all be
   removed and if the sure Word of Prophecy which is like unto a light
   that shines in a dark place, should become extinct--what, then, would
   be the horrible darkness?

   Now, I think the vision of Zechariah may remove all fear on that score.
   Rest you well assured that the lighthouse which God has lighted to
   guide men across the boisterous sea and preserve them from the peril of
   eternal shipwreck shall have its lamps trimmed throughout all time!
   Until the "Sun of Righteousness" shall rise, that lantern shall never
   go out, for the Lord will take care that the Light of God shall still
   shine, notwithstanding all that the powers of darkness may

   do, or devise to extinguish it. This one thought I beseech you so to
   grasp that it may strengthen your faith and comfort your hearts--the
   light of God's Grace has been kindled never to be quenched! To this end
   I invite your attention to the interesting parable contained in the
   marvelous vision which Zechariah the Prophet beheld and described.

   I. First, turn aside and see this great sight! Look, I beseech you, at
   THE WONDERFUL LAMP WHICH GOD HAS

   PROVIDED TO LIGHT THE SONS OF MEN. "He said unto me, What do you see?
   And I said, I have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a
   bowl upon the top of it and it has seven lamps thereon and seven pipes
   to its seven lamps, which are upon the top." Here is a candlestick that
   must challenge the notice of all who gaze at it, for it is of costly
   material and curious form--the work of wisdom fitted for the Holy Place
   of the tabernacle of the Most High! It resembles the candlestick whose
   pattern Moses received from God and yet, in some respects, it differs,
   as we shall see.

   The object is scarcely more remarkable than its position. Note that it
   stood in the open. Under the old Covenant the candlestick stood within
   curtains where only priestly eyes might see it--it was hidden from the
   mass of the people. We are very apt to think that because the Jewish
   ritual was full of symbols, the worship of the people must have been of
   so materialistic a character that there was little or nothing to raise
   the soul to spiritual adoration of the Invisible One. But it was not
   so--to the average Israelite there was little more of symbol than to
   us. Although it is true that within the Holy Place there were many
   symbols, yet there were very few of God's people who ever saw one of
   them and most probably we, ourselves, know far more about the types
   than the Jews ever did.

   The worship was not visible to the camp, for it was within an enclosed
   space and when the people were settled in Canaan the actual temple area
   could only hold a few of the vast multitudes who inhabited the land.
   Within the Holy Place, the holiest of all, the "Holy of Holies," no man
   ever entered except the High Priest and he but once in the year so that
   they who worshipped God in the further parts of Palestine would, for
   the most part, not even see the Tabernacle or the Temple! And when they
   did go up to Jerusalem, they believed that the symbols were inside,
   behind the veil. Their worship had less of the visible about it than we
   are apt to imagine, for most of the material emblems were simply
   certified to them by testimony and not otherwise verified to their
   senses.

   Then, as if to let us know that the Light of God did not yet fully
   shine among men and that the fullness of Grace and Truth had not yet
   been revealed, seeing Christ had not come, the seven-branched golden
   candlestick stood out of sight of the mass of the people, shut in
   within the curtains, enclosed within the Holy Place. But the lamp which
   Zechariah saw was in the open air! We are quite sure of this because he
   saw two olive trees growing, one on each side of it. It was, therefore,
   in an open space. Today, Beloved, "the veil of the temple is torn in
   two." What was mystery before has become plain to us now. Now we see
   Jesus and, seeing Jesus, we behold a Light such as never greeted the
   eyes of Prophets and kings. Though they longed to behold it, they died
   without the sight.

   Let us take care that we keep this lamp in the open--do not let us
   suffer anyone to shut it up. Let the Gospel be preached plainly to the
   masses of the people. Let the adorable name of Jesus Christ be
   proclaimed in your street corners. In every place where you can have
   access to the sons of men, let it be known that there is salvation in
   none other than by Him and all that believe in Him shall obtain the
   forgiveness of sins. Some would cover up the golden lamp with
   ceremonial observances and others would hide it away under
   philosophical quibbles and theological jargon! But be it yours to be a
   "city set on a hill that cannot be hid" and what is said to you in
   secret, speak in the light--what you learn in closets--publish aloud
   upon the housetops!

   Lift up the beacon that it may flame afar all over the land and across
   the sea! Let the blaze of Gospel light flare out till dwellers in the
   utmost parts of the earth shall ask, "What is this light? From where
   does it come?" and you shall answer, "It is the candlestick of the Lord
   once hidden among the peculiar people, but now set out before the
   nations in Christ Jesus! It was once concealed under type and emblem,
   but now made manifest by Him who speaks no more by parable, but tells
   us plainly of the Father."

   Note, next, that it was a lamp of pure gold. This is a fact of much
   significance. We are emphatically told that it was a "candlestick all
   of gold." The major vessels of the tabernacle were all of gold and
   this, I think, indicates that the lamp which God has kindled is of the
   most precious kind. The Church, which may be said to represent this
   candlestick, is as God has made it--of pure gold. Those who are united
   together in the fellowship of the Church of God on earth should be a
   holy people, precious in the sight of the Lord, as gold is precious
   among metals. There should be no mixture of dross

   and tin, no careless reception of carnal men and mere formalists--but
   those who are elect of God, precious in His sight and honorable.

   God's chosen should be choice men. The lamp which holds the golden
   light should itself be of gold! The Lord will not use an unholy church
   to be His light-bearer and where there is an apostasy as to doctrine,
   an absence of spiritual life, or a defection as to holiness of conduct,
   He will not use such a church, lest His holy name be polluted among
   men! His candlestick is all of pure gold! His people are a "peculiar
   people," "sanctified unto Himself," "zealous of good works." If any who
   seem to be religious delight themselves in sin--if they fail in
   purity--they have no power to give light. And because of their
   depravity they are as spots in our solemn feasts and mists that dim the
   brightness of our shining.

   Ungodly churches are not the candles of the Lord! If men find pleasure
   in unrighteousness, they exert an influence baneful as the shadow of
   death. How can the Light of God shine from them while they serve the
   Prince of Darkness? What a mercy it is that God has set up a Church in
   the world which shall bear testimony to His name and shall scatter the
   Light abroad, because His Grace makes and keeps it "holiness unto the
   Lord"! Let us love the Church of God! We must never think that any one
   congregation, or any thousand congregations, can comprise the whole of
   that Church! It is not for us to say, "The temple of the Lord are we."
   God forbid!

   He has a people scattered up and down throughout the whole earth--He
   has a remnant even among churches which err from the faith who have
   still kept their garments unspotted from the world, "And they shall be
   Mine, says the Lord, in the day when I make up My jewels." Let us pray
   for the Church militant, the entire body of His elect, the redeemed of
   the Lord, the quickened of the Spirit, the called-out ones, the true
   ecclesiae, the assemblies of the Lord, for these are they that are His
   candlesticks, standing in the open as a "city set upon a hill that
   cannot be hid," holding forth the Word of Life, that all who see the
   Church in its life and the Church in its testimony may behold the Light
   of God!

   This wonderful candlestick, all of gold, you will observe, is lit with
   golden oil. Such is the expression used in our text. At the 12th verse,
   we read, "Which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out
   of themselves." The quality of the oil is, doubtless, here commended,
   for I suppose it means the very best possible oil of a rich golden
   color and in value, in splendor, in purity and in clearness excellent
   beyond all praise. This represents that precious doctrine, that golden
   Truth of God, that fullness of Gospel Grace which keeps alive the Light
   of the Church of God. Or may it not remind us of the Divine Spirit,
   who, coming into His Church and imparting to her the golden oil of His
   Graces and gifts, enables her to maintain her brilliance of testimony
   and to scatter her Light among the sons of men.

   The Holy Spirit is also the flame by which the oil is kindled and made
   to burn and give its light--and thus we have the Truth of God on a
   blaze with sacred fervor--sound doctrine united with intense zeal--and
   all because the Spirit of Truth is present and reveals Himself at the
   same time as the Spirit of Power! We will say of this golden oil that
   it is the Truth, the living and incorruptible Word of God. This is the
   oil which the Church must burn and with this she must trim her lamps.
   No strange doctrines, no vain traditions, no scientific conjectures, no
   poetical reveries, no thoughts of men, no excogitations of human
   brains, but the revealed Word of God, the Truth as Jesus Christ has
   given it to us! The Truth as the Holy Spirit has revealed it in the
   sacred Book! The Truth as He brings it home with Divine power to our
   understanding and conscience.

   This it is that we must use and we must take care that if we have it,
   we empty it out of ourselves into the golden pipes that they may never
   be without sacred oil to keep the flame alive! Precious beyond all
   conception is the Truth of God! God will not be served with falsehood,
   but in Truth is His delight. Take care that you bring nothing here but
   the best of the best, nothing but the unadulterated olive oil of
   Revelation. What blunders and mistakes we make in the management of our
   own business! Should not this make us very careful in doing the work of
   the Lord that we do it not in a slovenly manner and so provoke Him to
   anger?

   Dear Brothers and Sisters, I hope we desire to be clean before God as
   to His Truth. I pray you not to trifle with it! Never tack with the
   wind of public opinion, but watch, if necessary, while the world lasts
   and wait for the fulfillment of God's Word and be assured that it will
   surely come to pass. Though you may well be tolerant of error in
   others, since you are so liable to it yourselves, yet be jealous of
   your own hearts and keep out of them every false doctrine. "Contend
   earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints." If there is any
   adulteration of the oil, the lamps will burn but dimly-- perhaps they
   will go out. This golden lamp shone with a sevenfold brightness! There
   were seven lamps to this golden can-

   dlestick and there were seven pipes to the seven lamps--and, as some
   read it, there were seven pipes to each one of these lamps, so that it
   gave seven times the light that the old lamp of the Temple ever gave.

   The suggestion has been hazarded that there were seven times seven
   pipes and the Hebrew might allow of such a translation. At any rate,
   there was seven times more light given by this mystic lamp seen by
   Zechariah than had ever been given by the candlestick of the old
   dispensation. God has given us Light enough to flood the world with,
   today, in the generous Gospel that is preached among all nations. The
   light of the Law all but blinded the dim eyes of the Jew, but oh, the
   Light of the Gospel! How it has sometimes overpowered all our senses!
   Saul of Tarsus tells us that about noon, suddenly there shone a great
   light round about him and he fell to the earth. So, too, many of us can
   testify that when the Glory of God in the salvation of a lost sinner
   first flashed upon our souls, we were so amazed that no strength
   remained in us!

   "Dissolved by His goodness we fell to the ground and wept to the praise
   of the mercy we found." Overpowering was the effect when the brilliance
   of Gospel Light beamed upon our weak eyes at first and even now, though
   the Lord has strengthened our spiritual sight so that we rejoice in the
   Light, it is still, at times, more than we can bear! What a glory it
   has! Vain men ask us to delight ourselves with the sparks they have
   kindled! Let it suffice that our Light renders all the flashes of
   natural joy, things too dim to notice! They tell us of something new
   they have thought up. To their apprehension, no doubt, it seems very
   wonderful. They may strike their matches and light their candles if
   they will--we are more than satisfied with the Eternal Sun!

   You may bring your ancient lamps from Rome. You may fetch your tapers
   from Oxford and the Anglican imitators of Rome, but the lamp which the
   Holy Spirit has kindled by the Divine Word is better than all the glare
   of Antichrist! This despised Book has seven times more light than all
   the solons of antiquity or all the glare of modern times. There is none
   like it! Only have eyes to see it and you shall rejoice in this Light!
   It is the Light of God, Himself! Spread it, then, if you have it and
   let it shine in your families! Let it shine on the town or city where
   you dwell! Let it shine all over the earth, for there is no such light
   as the Light of the Eternal Gospel, "the light of the glory of God in
   the face of Jesus Christ." Oh that all saw it and loved it and lived in
   it!

   II. Thus have I spoken about the wonderful lamp. Now, I ask those of
   you who love the study of God's Word to follow me a little in
   considering the description that is given of THE COMPLETE MACHINERY,
   THE PERFECT APPARATUS PROVIDED FOR THIS LAMP. If you notice, it was a
   "Candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it and it has
   seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon
   the top: and two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl
   and the other upon the left side." We do not read anything about pipes
   and bowls in the old Temple lamp. I suppose that each one of its seven
   lights had to be fed distinctly and separately by the officiating
   priest with a separate portion of oil, but in this case there seems to
   have been a bowl at the top of the seven branches into which the golden
   oil first entered and from which it flowed out again and thus each of
   the branch lights was fed.

   At any rate, you see that a complete apparatus was provided and is
   described. The details are given. The pipes, bowl and so on were all
   arranged with exquisite precision. Correspondingly, in the Church of
   God we ought to pay much attention to detail. I do not think we look to
   it half as much as we should. If the lamps are to be kept trimmed, you
   must attend to the pipes and you must see to the golden oil. We ought,
   each man, to think, "Now, I have something to do to keep this
   candlestick in proper order. I have something to do with keeping this
   lamp burning." One man may be compared, as it were, to the bowl because
   he yields much of the light of intelligence and instruction,
   communicating knowledge and counsel to the Church of God.

   Another is a pipe to the Sunday school and yet another golden pipe runs
   to the young men's class. One is a pipe to the poor and ignorant in the
   streets, another to the sick, another is a golden pipe to those who are
   at home with their families. There is some point to which each one in
   Christ's Church may help to conduct the golden oil to keep the blessed
   flame of the Truth of God always burning in this dark world. I want
   you, Brothers and Sisters, to look, one and all of you, after the
   details of Church work. Especially in a Church of such magnitude as
   this, with such a multiplicity of agencies, attention to detail is most
   requisite. What can one overseer do? What could 20 pastors do? It is
   impossible if you leave this work entirely to us that it will ever be
   properly discharged.

   Oh no--let each member have its own office in the body, even as each
   pipe had its own oil to carry to the one light of the candlestick which
   it had to supply. Do not get out of your place, do not interfere with
   other people's service--do

   your own work and see that it is well done and then look over all the
   Church and pray the Lord to supervise the whole, so that the golden
   bowl and the golden pipes may all be in full operation. Of this
   machinery which is thus mentioned in detail there seems to have been an
   abundance. If there were seven pipes to each one of the lights of the
   lamp, (and I think it was so), there could have been no lack of
   service. So, beloved Friends, we must mind that the Church in her
   machinery is ever kept abundantly supplied!

   We ought not to be slack in our labors nor scanty in our equipments.
   The everlasting Gospel should be promulgated with great energy and
   varied service. Little oil will mean little light--little Grace will
   mean little work for God and little Glory to His blessed name. But let
   us endeavor to make every arrangement more effective. The light might
   not be extinguished even in one pipe--to the completeness of the Divine
   design every light must be in good order. Be it our aim to keep the
   seven pipes constantly flowing and feeding so as to convey a sevenfold
   measure of oil that the light may burn steadily on from hour to hour
   till the Lord comes! This apparatus still further suggests to us the
   idea of unity. As I have already said, there were seven distinct lights
   to the old lamp of the Jewish sanctuary and these could be individually
   filled--but here they are all one.

   One bowl is filled with oil and from it the oil runs down the pipes to
   each of the lights. So is there unity in the Church. We all suffer if
   one suffers! We are all the better if one is in a prosperous condition.
   No man lives to himself and no man dies to himself. Though I speak of
   myself now as a fool, yet, it is true--if I decline in Grace I injure
   all of you, more or less, and you, also, in some measure, exert a like
   influence upon me, though not to the same extent, because you do not
   occupy the same public station. Every member of the Church who grows
   poor in Grace impoverishes all the rest in some degree. We act and
   react upon each other. I am sure the preacher can do injury to the
   hearer and the hearer can, in measure, injure the preacher. Let your
   Grace decline and your prayerfulness be restrained and the pastor must
   feel the loss and his ministry will bear melancholy evidence that the
   Spirit of God is not witnessing mightily among us.

   So instead of one enriching the other we may, by sinful neglect,
   mutually endanger our prosperity--no, we may beggar each other and
   become partners in destitution and distress! May it never be so with
   us, but may we always prove ourselves to be a warm-hearted, loving,
   prayerful people who are so glowing ourselves that we warm up those
   that are cold and kindle fresh life in those that are expiring! Then if
   the whole congregation is consecrated to God and the Grace of our Lord
   Jesus Christ gladdens them all and they are filled with the fruits of
   righteousness, the minister can never be dull and drowsy--his heart
   will be aglow with sacred fervor and his preaching will be resplendent
   with Divine Light and fire!

   The pews will respond to the pulpit! Fire will kindle to a flame and
   the flame will kindle fresh fire! Vitality will promote revival--our
   tone will be spirited and inspiriting! A breath from the four winds
   will make a stir among the dry bones and an army shall presently arise.
   The force of sympathy shall be felt and oh, free commerce in all our
   holy gifts will flourish in our commonwealth! Oh may it be so! I know
   it is desirable and I feel that it will be attained. Nor is it merely
   for one Church we are thus anxious--all the Churches need the same
   consecration. If one Church is dull, it injures other Churches. All the
   Churches of Jesus Christ are really one and, as even my little finger
   cannot be ailing without my head suffering in consequence, so even the
   smallest Church in the most remote village cannot decline without the
   entire body of the faithful, whether it is known to themselves or not,
   being losers thereby.

   Look well, then, to every portion of the apparatus of this golden
   lamp--examine its details--keep it well trimmed and abundantly
   supplied. Remember its unity, for with all its many pipes, it is but
   one candlestick.

   III. But the most remarkable disclosure in this vision was THE
   MYSTERIOUS SUPPLY BY WHICH THESE

   LAMPS ARE KEPT BURNING. There were no priests to trim these lamps, nor
   is mention made of anyone being appointed to keep them in order! No
   golden snuffers nor golden snuff dishes were used. Nor was any oil
   brought by any living man to replenish them. That is remarkable!
   Moreover there is no mention of oil being given by the people. The lamp
   in the Temple was fed by the offerings of the people--they brought the
   best oil to keep the lamp perpetually burning before the altar. There
   is nothing of the kind here--that is not the way by which this oil gets
   to the lamp in the vision before us. Neither by priest nor people is it
   supplied.

   But how, then? Why simply by a natural process without any
   machinery--for there are two olive branches--"Two olive trees by it,
   one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side.
   And these trees in this vision empty the golden oil out of themselves
   through the two golden pipes and so the marvelous lamp is kept
   supplied! It is a very

   amazing picture which is now before you, oil flowing directly from the
   living tree and at once creating light! Ordinarily, when the olive tree
   yields its berries, they must be taken to the mill and ground before
   oil can be produced. I have gone into the olive mill, myself, and seen
   the great stones crushing the berries and I have seen the other
   processes by which the olive oil is prepared for the lamp--but there is
   no mention, here, of any mill, or press, or strainer, or jar, or bottle
   of oil.

   The food of this light does not come in that way at all, but the tree
   grows and, in a mysterious way imparts its fatness to the bowl from the
   pipe and in this way the flame is fed. Thus we are shown that the Light
   of God is not dependent upon human will or human skill! It is an apt
   illustration of the text we were reading just now which lights up the
   whole chapter. "Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit, says the
   Lord of Hosts." Not by your grinding out your oil by laboriously
   turning the mill of study, nor by your contributions of wealth, nor by
   your eloquence and logic, but by Divine agency shall living men be
   raised up and through these living men shall come the wondrous golden
   oil of Grace by which the lamp of testimony shall be kept bright and
   the darkness of the world shall be overcome!

   At first sight the provision may appear to be inadequate to the
   purpose. For God to make two olive trees grow by the side of the
   candlestick seems, at first, to be a deficient arrangement because the
   trees stand out so separate from the lamp that we cannot perceive any
   connection between them. Had I beheld that vision as the Prophet saw
   it, I feel I should have been as perplexed as he was. I would have
   said, "What are these?" I could not have made it out. Two olive trees
   growing by the side of a candelabrum! What connection can there be
   between them and it? But that is the very pith of the vision! You are
   to be shown the unique manner in which the Lord keeps His Church
   burning and shining without mechanism. He simply raises up chosen men,
   perhaps only two, sometimes more, who live and grow and in their life
   and growth they bring forth, by God's Grace, as from their very souls,
   the sacred Truth of God--the holy oil with which the lamp of God is
   kept burning!

   I suppose that the two olive trees represent, in this case Joshua, the
   High Priest, of whom we read that his filthy garments were taken away
   and he was clothed with change of raiment. And Zerubbabel, of whom we
   read in this chapter that his hands had laid the foundation and his
   hands should finish the house. These were the two men whom God
   strengthened and enabled to set up a standard because of the Truth of
   God. The Lord qualified them to build the Temple that He might be
   glorified. Those two men, by Divine Grace, carried out the Lord's
   design, moving the people to the sacred service. Joshua was made the
   ruler and teacher of the people and Zerubbabel was promised that his
   hands should lay the top stone, as his hands had laid the foundation of
   the Temple. And this, too, when Judah's lamp burned

   dim and her light was well-near gone out!

   These two, though they were nothing in themselves but godly men, who,
   like living trees, brought forth fruit unto God, should be the means,
   according to the appointment of God, of keeping up the sacred Testimony
   so long as they lived. Such means certainly appear insignificant in
   comparison with the magnificent result to be achieved. But that is
   God's way of working--He generally works by ones or twos and when He
   uses two, He couples them well. In the missions of the Lord's ordaining
   we observe Moses and Aaron, Caleb and Joshua, Elijah and Elisha, Peter
   and John, Paul and Barnabas, Calvin and Luther, Whitefield and Wesley.

   Foolish persons rail at a one-man ministry, but what can they say
   against a two-man ministry? To the end of time there will be two
   witnesses--representative men will rise in pairs and do the work of the
   Lord so as to awaken the whole Church. Little as the world may think of
   them at the time, men do arise whose influence wonderfully displays the
   power of God, for they are made to stand like olive trees and, by some
   mysterious means, it is through them that the lamp of God is kept
   burning continuously! Of these two men I want you to notice two things.
   You wonder how it is that God should speak of them as keeping the lamp
   burning. He does so speak of them, for He says, "These are the two
   anointed ones that stand by the Lord of the whole earth."

   First, remember that they are able to do this because they stand before
   the Lord of the whole earth! Those whom God chooses to do His work
   stand as His servants in His sight--they could do nothing of themselves
   or by themselves, but their testimony comes from God and their unction
   is of the Holy One and they are clothed with Divine energy-- otherwise
   they would be weak as the rest of their brothers. Then be sure of this
   that they have been anointed--they are said to be "anointed ones." We
   have no power to pour forth oil till we have been, ourselves, anointed.
   It is not possible that we should feed the holy Light until God has
   worked in us the will of His own good Spirit. These men are said to

   have been filled with the Spirit of God according to the sixth
   verse--"Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, says the Lord."

   There is Joshua! You can see him. He is clad in filthy garments! Is
   this the Lord's High Priest? Is this he that is to instruct the people?
   Is he the man who wears garments that are old and soiled and foul? Yes,
   that is the man! "Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, says
   the Lord of Hosts," and My Spirit shall rest upon this poor Joshua,
   this brand plucked out of the burning and he shall teach My people!
   There is the other man over yonder--Zerubbabel. He is a poor, timid
   creature. It is the day of small things with him. He has but little
   confidence. God has to chide him and say, "Who has despised the day of
   small things?" But he is the man before whom the mountain shall become
   a plain! He is the man that shall build the Temple of the Lord because
   the Spirit of God shall be upon Him--"Not by might, nor by power, but
   by My Spirit, says the Lord of Hosts."

   You will always find that when God chooses men to do His work, He makes
   it palpable to everybody that they are nothing but men. Sometimes they
   have imperfections over which we mourn very much and over which they
   mourn far more than we do! But these manifest tokens of their infirmity
   show more distinctly the infinite skill of Him who uses such poor
   instruments. The frailty of the earthen vessels is made evident so that
   the excellency of the power which is of God and not of them may be the
   more conspicuous! So it is with God's work, for He will have it known
   that it is not by charm of eloquence, nor by force of reasoning, but by
   His Spirit that He operates with resistless power! He takes men, poor
   humble men that seem no more able to trim the golden lamp than two
   olive trees would be and He works by them to the praise of the Glory of
   His Grace!

   Yet these men must be full of faith. "Who are you, O great mountain?
   Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain." I doubt not that
   Zerubbabel grasped that promise, relied upon it and rejoiced in it and
   proved himself to be a man of faith. God will use us, whatever our
   faults are, if we have faith! I do not know what use He could make of
   any man who has no faith. Read the 11th chapter of Hebrews and notice
   on what strange men God set the seal of His approbation because they
   had faith. Samson may be quoted as an extreme case--speaking after the
   manner of men we might have thought that God would have set him aside,
   altogether, because there were such serious flaws in his character. Yet
   he was a great child-man who, with all his faults, believed in God and,
   perhaps, believed more in God than many who were far better than he in
   other respects.

   With a thousand enemies before him, only think of that one man, daring,
   through His confidence in God, to fling himself upon them all--with no
   weapon except a poor ass's jawbone! Look! He leaps upon the crowd!
   "Heaps upon heaps. With the jawbone of an ass have I slain a thousand
   men." He never counted the odds. He just went at it, believing that God
   would help him, however tremendous the struggle might be. So when they
   put him, blind as he was, into that huge temple of the Philistine gods
   where everything was so strong and massive that it could bear up all
   the Philistine lords up there in the gallery, he begins feeling for the
   pillars. This poor blind man, whose hair had been shorn and who had
   been made a prisoner by his bitter adversaries, feels for the huge
   columns, believing that God would enable him to snap them like reeds,
   or rock them to and fro as bulrushes!

   Oh what a desperate and glorious tug was that! What a transcendent act
   of faith when he bowed himself with all his might and pulled the
   structure down upon the heads of his oppressors! A glorious faith
   animated him! He was a poor specimen of propriety in many respects--he
   was made of strange stuff--but there was grandeur in his faith and that
   saved him! O my dear Brother, if you can believe God, God can use you!
   But if you have no faith, or if you have but a weak, trembling faith,
   your unbelief will hinder the Lord and it will be said of you, "God
   could not do many mighty works by him, because of his unbelief."

   Oh, if we could believe more implicitly and venture to act more
   unreservedly on the certainty of the covenanted promises, what exploits
   we might achieve! The limit of our usefulness is narrowly set by our
   lack of confidence in God. If we had more faith, the harvests we reap
   which yield tenfold, might yield fifty-fold, or a hundred-fold! With
   more faith the weakest of us might be as David and David would be as
   the Angel of the Lord! God grant us His Grace that we may so believe
   and rely upon His sure Word that we may become men fit for His use and
   profitable for His service. One thing more is prominent and
   unmistakable about these men--these olive-tree men that fed the lamp
   and kept it burning--they ascribed all their success to Grace, for it
   is said that when the top stone of the Temple should be brought out
   there should be shouts of, "Grace, Grace, unto it."

   If souls are saved, it is always by a ministry of Grace! Whatever else
   is left out in a soul-saving testimony, there must be a clear ring as
   to Grace! Election by the Grace of the Father, regeneration by the
   Grace of the Holy Spirit, remission of sins by the Grace of God through
   the atoning blood of Jesus--Grace beginning, continuing and perfecting!
   I like the word, "Grace," even when it is coupled with an adjective and
   spoken of as, "Sovereign Grace," "Free Grace," "Effectual Grace"--and
   all those whom God will bless must be men that love His Grace and feel
   His Grace and preach His Grace-- for this is the very essence of the
   golden oil by which the lamp is trimmed. These men, or rather these
   trees, emptied out the golden oil, "out of themselves."

   They did not make the golden oil--it came into them by the miraculous
   power of God--the process was beyond Nature! Men cannot create Grace
   any more than trees could prepare oil themselves. Olive trees cannot
   distil oil without a press, nor can men be the means of Grace to others
   unless God shall cause them to be so and then they empty out themselves
   to a good and gracious purpose. Well, dear Brothers and Sisters, if you
   want to know how to be useful, one of the things that is absolutely
   necessary is that you empty yourselves out! Do you expect to give
   anything to another without losing it yourself? You will be mistaken!
   Take it as a general rule that nothing can come out of you that is not
   in you and as the next general rule it takes something out of you to
   give something to other people.

   Paul said he did not merely wish to impart the Gospel to the people,
   but himself, also. Though he did not preach himself, yet he was willing
   to spend and be spent so long as he could bring souls to Christ. I
   believe the difference between the result of the labor of one man and
   another is often this--one gives more out from himself than another. I
   am acquainted with some very learned Brothers of mine who do not feed
   many people. They are huge barrels of learning, like the Heidelberg
   wine cask and they are full to the brim with the best wine in the
   world, but never much comes out! On the other hand, I have never,
   myself, been anything but a very small cask but I let everything run
   out that is put into me. If you have not 10 talents to boast of, turn
   the one talent you have over and over and over and over again and you
   will make far more of it than if you let many talents lie still and
   rust.

   Take care that you are actively earnest in the cause of the Master and
   a blessing will surely come out of it. Oh how it shows the wisdom of
   God and the power of God when He makes simple means produce surprising
   results and, by feeble instruments, compasses His infinite
   forethoughts! God might have been glorified by doing the work Himself,
   as when of old He stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations
   of the earth, speaking and it was done. But He is far more glorified by
   using poor, unworthy creatures for the accomplishment of His Divine
   purposes! When Quintin Matsys made the celebrated well-cover at
   Antwerp, it would have been highly creditable to him even if he had
   used the best of implements to make it with.

   When we are told, however, that his fellow workmen robbed him of his
   tools and that he did it with one common hammer or some such
   instrument, our estimation of the artist's skill is greatly enhanced.
   It is no wonder that the Spirit of God can, Himself, convert souls--the
   wonder is that He converts men by us! That we, who are so imperfect and
   so feeble, should become channels of blessing is a great marvel! Those
   two olive trees might, it was feared, grow in the way of the light, but
   God made them to be its maintainers! The branches of our infirmity
   might hide the light from the people's eyes if Grace did not intervene
   and make every one of them yield its olives and pour out its measure of
   oil for the supply of the golden candelabrum!

   Therefore, Brothers and Sisters, if you have the Light of God, shed it!
   If you have Grace, endeavor to impart it! The Lord has blessed you--ask
   Him to bless you more by His Holy Spirit. Let those olive trees,
   yielding abundance of oil, be your model that your lively vigor may
   prove of lasting value to the Church. So be the Lord with you from now
   on and forever. Amen and amen!

The Lamentations of Jesus

   (No. 1570)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 28, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "When He had come near, He beheld the city and wept over it." Luke
   19:41.

   ON three occasions we are told that Jesus wept. You know them well, but
   it may be worth while to refresh your memories. The first was when our
   Lord was about to raise Lazarus from the dead. He saw the sorrow of the
   sisters and He meditated upon the fruit of sin in the death and
   corruption of the body and He groaned in spirit and it is written that
   "Jesus wept." Those who divided the chapters did well to make a
   separate verse of that simple sentence. It stands alone, the smallest
   and yet, in some respects, the greatest verse in the whole Bible! It
   shines as a diamond of the first water. It contains a world of healing
   balm condensed into a drop. Here we have much in little--a wealth of
   meaning in two words.

   The second occasion we have before us and we will make it the theme of
   our discourse. At the sight of the beloved but rebellious city, Jesus
   wept. The third occasion is mentioned by the Apostle Paul in the fifth
   chapter of his Epistle to the Hebrews where he tells us what else we
   might not have known, that the Savior, "in the days of His flesh,
   offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto
   Him that was able to save Him from death and was heard in that He
   feared." That passage relates to the Gethsemane agony in which a shower
   of bitter tears was mingled with the bloody sweat. The strength of His
   love strove with the anguish of His soul and, in the process, forced
   forth the sacred waters of His eyes. Thus our Savior wept in sympathy
   with domestic sorrow and sanctified the tears of the bereaved.

   We, too, may weep when brethren and friends lie dead, for Jesus wept.
   There need not be rebellion in our mourning, for Jesus fully consented
   to the Divine will and yet He wept. We may weep at the graves of those
   we love and yet be guiltless of unbelief as to their resurrection, for
   Jesus knew that Lazarus would rise again and yet He wept. Our Lord, in
   weeping over Jerusalem, showed His sympathy with national troubles and
   His distress at the evils which awaited His countrymen. Men should not
   cease to be patriots when they become Believers--saints should bemoan
   the ills which come upon the guilty people among whom they are numbered
   and do so all the more because they are saints.

   Our Lord's third weeping was induced by the great burden of human guilt
   which pressed upon Him. This shows us how we, too, should look upon the
   guilt of men and mourn over it before God. But in this special weeping
   Jesus is alone--there was a something in the tears of Gethsemane to
   which we cannot reach, for He who shed them was then beginning to
   suffer as our Substitute and in that case He must necessarily tread the
   winepress alone and of the people there must be none with Him. Behold
   beneath the olive trees a solitary Weeper enduring a grief which,
   blessed be His name, is now impossible to us, seeing He has taken away
   the transgressions which called for it!

   We will now turn to this second instance of our Savior's weeping and
   here we find, when we look at the original words, that it is not
   exactly expressed by the words used in our admirable English version.
   We there read, "He beheld the city and wept over it," but the Greek
   means a great deal more than tears and includes sobs and cries. Perhaps
   it may be best to read it, "He lamented over it." He suffered a deep
   inward anguish and He expressed it by signs of woe and by words which
   showed how bitter was His grief. Our subject will not be the
   lamentations of Jeremiah, but the lamentations of Jesus--the
   lamentations of Him who could more truly say than the weeping Prophet,
   "I am the Man that has seen affliction by the rod of His wrath. My eyes
   run down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of My
   people. Behold and see if there is any sorrow like unto My sorrow which
   is done unto Me."

   Jesus is here a King by general acclamation, but King of grief by
   personal lamentation. He is the Sovereign of sorrow, weeping while
   riding in triumph in the midst of His followers. Did He ever look more
   kingly than when He showed the tenderness of His heart towards His
   rebellious subjects? The city which had been the metropolis of the
   house of David never saw so truly a royal man before, for He is most
   fit to rule who is most ready to sympathize! We shall, this morning,

   as God shall help us, first, consider our Lord's inward grief. And
   then, secondly, His verbal lamentation. Oh for the power of the Spirit
   to bless the meditation to the melting of all our hearts! O Lord, speak
   to the rock and bid the waters flow, or, if it pleases You better,
   strike it with Your rod and make it gush with rivers--only in some way
   make us answer to the mourning of our Savior--

   "Did Christ over sinners weep And shall our cheeks be dry? Let floods
   of penitential grief Burst forth from every eye."

   I. First, we are to contemplate OUR LORD'S INWARD GRIEF. We note
   concerning it that it was so intense that it could not be restrained by
   the occasion. The occasion was one entirely by itself--a brief gleam of
   sunlight in a cloudy day, a glimpse of summer amid a cruel winter. His
   disciples had brought the colt and had placed Him on it and He was
   riding to the city which was altogether moved at His coming. The
   multitudes were eager to do Him homage with waving branches and loud
   hosannas, while His disciples in the inner circle were exulting in
   songs of praise which almost emulated the angelic chorales of His birth
   night. "Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth, goodwill toward
   men," found its echo when the disciples said, "Blessed be the King that
   comes in the name of the Lord: peace in Heaven and glory in the

   highest."

   Yet amidst the hosannas of the multitude, while the palm branches were
   yet in many hands, the Savior stopped to weep! On the very spot where
   David had gone centuries before weeping, the Son of David stayed awhile
   to look upon the city and to pour out His lamentation! That must have
   been deep grief which ran counter to all the demands of the season and
   violated, as it were, all the decorum of the occasion. It turned a
   festival into a mourning, a triumph into a lament. Ah, He knew the
   hollowness of all the praises which were ringing in His ears! He knew
   that they who shouted hosanna today would, before many suns had risen,
   cry, "Crucify Him! Crucify Him!" He knew that His joyous entrance into
   Jerusalem would be followed by a mournful procession out of it when
   they would take Him to the Cross that He might die.

   He saw amid all the effervescence of the moment the small residue of
   sincerity that there was in it and He accepted it--but He lamented the
   abundance of mere outward excitement which would disappear like the
   froth of the sea--and so He stood and wept. It was a great sorrow,
   surely, which turned such a day of hopefulness into a season of
   anguish. It strikes me that all that day the Savior fasted and, if so,
   it is singular that He should have purposely kept for Himself a fast
   while others on His account held a festival! The reason why He did so,
   I think, is this--Mark says, "And now the eventide was come, He went
   out unto Bethany with the twelve. And on the morrow, when they were
   come from Bethany, He was hungry: and seeing a fig tree afar off having
   leaves, He came, if haply He might find anything thereon."

   Such hunger had not come upon Him if it had not been preceded by a fast
   the day before. See, then, your Lord surrounded, as it were, with
   billows of praise in the midst of a tumultuous sea of exultation,
   Himself standing as a lone rock, unmoved by all the excitement around
   Him. Deep was the grief which could not be concealed or controlled on
   such a day when the sincere congratulations of His disciples, the happy
   songs of children and the loud hosannas of the multitude everywhere
   welcomed Him.

   The greatness of His grief may be seen, again, by the fact that it
   overshadowed other very natural feelings which might have been and,
   perhaps, were, excited by the occasion. Our Lord stood on the brow of
   the hill where He could see Jerusalem before Him in all its beauty.
   What thoughts it awakened in Him! His memory was stronger and quicker
   than ours, for His mental powers were unimpaired by sin and He could
   remember all the great and glorious things which had been spoken of
   Zion, the city of God. Yet, as He remembered them all, no joy came into
   His soul because of the victories of David or the pomp of
   Solomon--Temple and tower had lost all charm for Him--"the joy of the
   earth" brought no joy to Him. And at the sight of the venerable city
   and its holy and beautiful house He wept.

   Modern travelers who have any soul in them are always moved by the
   sublimity of the spectacle from the Mount of Olives. Dean Stanley
   wrote, "Nothing at Rome, Memphis, Thebes, Constantinople, or Athens can
   approach it in beauty or interest." And yet this is the poor, mean
   Jerusalem of modern times--by no means to be compared with the
   Jerusalem of our Savior's day! Yet the Lord Jesus says nothing about
   this city, "Beautiful for situation," except to lament over it. If He
   counts the towers there and marks well her bulwarks, it is only to
   bemoan their total overthrow. All the memories of the past did but
   swell the torrent of His anguish in the foresight of her doom!

   Something of admiration may have entered the Savior's holy breast, for
   before Him stood His Father's house, of which He still thought so much
   that even though He knew it would be left desolate, yet He took pains
   to purge it once again of the buyers and sellers who polluted it. That
   Temple was built of white marble and much of it, the roof especially,
   covered with slabs of gold. It must have been one of the fairest
   objects that ever human eye rested upon as it glittered in the sun
   before Him. But what were those great and costly stones? What were
   those curious carvings to Him? His heart was saying within itself,
   "There shall not be one stone left upon another that shall not be
   thrown down."

   His sadness at the foresight of the city's desolation mastered His
   natural feeling of admiration for its present glory. His sorrow found
   no alleviation either in the past or the present of the city's
   history--the dreadful future threw a pall over all. It mastered, too,
   the sympathy which He usually felt for those who were about Him. He
   would not stop His disciples from rejoicing, though the Pharisees asked
   Him, but He, Himself, took no share in the joy. Usually He was the most
   sensitive of men to all who were around Him, sorrowing with their
   sorrow and joying in their joy. But on this occasion they may wave
   their palms and cut down branches of trees and strew them in the way
   and the children may shout, Hosanna, but He who was the center of it
   all did not enter into the feeling of the hour--they celebrate--He
   weeps.

   More striking, still, is the fact that His grief for others prevented
   all apprehension for Himself. As He beheld that city, knowing that
   within a week He would die outside its gates, He might naturally have
   begun to feel the shadow of His sufferings, but no trace of such
   emotion is discoverable. You and I, in such a case, with the certainty
   of a speedy and ignominious death before us, would have been heavy
   about it, but Jesus was not. In all that flood of tears there was not
   one for His own death! The tears were all for Jerusalem's doom, even as
   He said afterwards, "Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for Me, but for
   yourselves and for your children."

   It is not "Woe is Me, the holy city will become an Aceldama, a field of
   blood by My slaughter," but, "Oh, if you had known, even you, in this,
   your day." He grieves for others, not for Himself! Yet it must have
   been a very intense emotion which thus swept away, as with a torrent,
   everything else so that He had neither joy for joy, nor sorrow for
   sorrow, but His whole strength of feeling was poured forth from one
   sluice and ran in one channel towards the devoted city which had
   rejected Him and was about to put Him to death! This great sorrow of
   His reveals to us the Nature of our Lord. How complex is the Person of
   Christ! He foresaw that the city would be destroyed and though He was
   Divine, He wept! He knew every single event and detail of the dreadful
   tragedy and used words about it of special historical accuracy which
   bring out His prophetic Character and yet the eyes so clear in seeing
   the future were almost blinded with tears!

   He speaks of Himself as willing and able to have averted this doom by
   gathering the guilty ones under His wings and thus He intimates His
   Godhead. While His Nature on the one side of it sees the certainty of
   the doom, the same Nature, from another side, laments the dread
   necessity! I will not say that His Godhead foresaw and His Manhood
   lamented, for so mysteriously is the Manhood joined to the Godhead that
   it makes but one Person and it were better to assert that the entire
   Nature of Christ lamented over Jerusalem. I have never been able to
   believe in an impassive God, though many theologians lay it down as an
   axiom that God cannot suffer. It seems to me that He can do or endure
   anything He wills to do or endure and I, for one, cannot see that there
   is any special glorifying of God in the notion that He is incapable in
   any direction whatever. We can only speak of Him after the manner of
   men and after that manner He speaks of Himself and, therefore, there is
   no wrong in so doing.

   It brings the great Father nearer when we see Him lamenting the
   wanderings of His children and joying in their penitent return. What
   but sorrow can be meant by such expressions as these? "How shall I give
   you up, Ephraim? How shall I deliver you, Israel? How shall I make you
   as Admah? How shall I set you as Zeboim? My heart is turned within Me;
   My repentings are kindled together." "Hear, O heavens and give ear, O
   earth: for the Lord has spoken, I have nourished and brought up
   children and they have rebelled against Me. The ox knows his owner and
   the ass his master's crib: but Israel does not know, My people do not
   consider." Are these the utterances of an unfeeling God? I believe it
   is the Christ, the entire Christ that both foretells the doom of
   Jerusalem and laments it.

   Some have even been staggered at the statement that Jesus wept. Certain
   of the early Christians, I am sorry to say, even went the length of
   striking the passage out of the Gospel because they thought that
   weeping would dishonor their Lord. They ought to have had more
   reverence for the Inspired Word and a truer knowledge of their Master
   and never to have wished to obliterate a record which reflects the
   highest honor upon man's Redeemer. Our Lord's lament gives us an
   insight into the great tenderness of His Character--He is so tender
   that He not only weeps while weeping would be of no

   use--but He laments when lamentation must be fruitless! He reminds me
   of a judge who, having before been a friend by warning, persuading,
   pleading with the prisoner, at last has the unutterable pain of
   condemning him--he puts on the black cap and, with many a sigh and
   tear, pronounces sentence--feeling the dreadful nature of the occasion
   far more than the criminal at the bar.

   He is overcome with emotion while he declares that the condemned must
   be taken to the place from where he came and there die a felon's death.
   Oh the tender heart of Christ, that when it comes to pronouncing the
   inevitable sentence, "Your house is left unto you desolate," yet He
   cannot utter the righteous words without lamentation! In this our Lord
   reveals the very heart of God! Did He not say, "He that has seen Me has
   seen the Father"? Here, then, you see the Father, Himself, even He who
   said of old, "As I live, says the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the
   death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live."
   The doom must be pronounced, for infinite Justice demands it, but Mercy
   laments what she was not permitted to prevent.

   Tears fall amid the thunders and though the doom is sealed by obstinate
   impenitence, yet judgment is evidently strange work to the patient
   Judge. This anguish showed how dreadful was the sentence, for what
   could stir the Savior so if the doom of sinners is a small affair? If
   the doom of guilt is such a trifle as some dream, I understand not why
   these tears! The whole Nature of Christ is convulsed as He thinks,
   first of Jerusalem plowed as a field and her children slaughtered till
   their blood runs in rivers of gore and, next, as He beholds the doom of
   the ungodly who must be driven from His Presence and from the Glory of
   His power to be the awful witnesses of Divine Justice and of God's
   hatred of evil. Thus standing on the brow of Olivet, the weeping Son of
   Man reveals to us the heart of God--slow to anger, of great mercy,
   waiting to be gracious and tardy in executing His wrath.

   For a practical lesson, we may remark that this weeping of the Savior
   should much encourage men to trust Him. Those who desire His salvation
   may approach Him without hesitation, for His tears prove His hearty
   desires for our good. When a man who is not given to sentimental tears,
   as some effeminate beings are, is seen to weep, we are convinced of his
   sincerity. When a strong man is passionately convulsed from head to
   foot and pours out lamentations, you feel that he is in downright
   earnest and if that earnestness is manifested on your behalf you can
   commit yourself to him. Oh, weeping Sinner, fear not to come to a
   weeping Savior! If you will not come to Jesus, it grieves Him! That you
   have not come long ago has wrung His heart! That you are still away
   from Him is His daily sorrow--come, then, to Him without delay!

   Let His tears banish your fears, yes, He gives you better encouragement
   than tears, for He has shed for sinners not drops from His eyes, alone,
   but from His heart! He died that sinners who believe in Him might live!
   His whole body was covered with bloody sweat when He agonized for
   you--how can you doubt His readiness to receive you? The five scars
   that still remain upon His blessed Person, up there at the Father's
   right hand, all invite you to approach Him! These dumb mouths most
   eloquently entreat you to draw near and trust in Him whom God has set
   forth as the Propitiation for sin! How shall He that wept and bled and
   died for sinners repulse a sinner who comes to Him at His bidding? Oh,
   come, come, come, I pray you, even now, to the weeping sinner's Friend.

   This, too, I think is an admonishment to Christian workers. Some of us,
   long ago, came to Jesus and we now occupy ourselves with endeavoring to
   bring others to Him. In this blessed work our Lord instructs us by His
   example. Brothers and Sisters, if we would have others come to Jesus we
   must be like Jesus in tenderness. We must be meek, lowly, gentle and
   sympathetic and we must be moved to deep emotion at the thought that
   any should perish. Never let us speak harshly of the doom of the
   wicked. Never let us speak flippantly, or without holy grief--the loss
   of Heaven and the endurance of Hell must always be themes for tears!
   That men should live without Christ is grief enough--but that they
   should DIE without Christ is an overwhelming horror which should grind
   our hearts to powder before God and make us fall on our faces and cry,
   "O God, have mercy upon them and save them, for Your Grace and for Your
   love's sake."

   The deepest tenderness, it may be, some of us have yet to learn.
   Perhaps we are passing through a school in which we shall be taught it
   and if we do but learn it we need not care how severe the instructive
   discipline may be. We ought not to look upon this city of London
   without tears, nor even upon a single sinner without sorrow. We must
   preach tenderly and teach tenderly if we would win souls. We are not to
   weep continually, for even Jesus did not do that, yet are we always to
   feel a tender love towards men so that we would be ready to die for
   them if we might but save them from the wrath to come and bring them
   into the haven of the Savior's rest!

   Let me add that I think the lament of Jesus should instruct all those
   who would now come to Him as to the manner of their approach. While I
   appealed to you, just now, were there any who said, "I would gladly
   come to Jesus, but how shall I come?" The answer is--come with sorrow
   and with prayer, even as it is written, "they shall come with weeping
   and with supplications will I lead them." As Jesus meets you, so meet
   Him. He shows you in what fashion to return, in what array to draw near
   to your Redeemer, for He comes to you clothed in no robes but those of
   mourning, adorned with no jewels but the pearls of His tears. Come to
   Him in the garments of humiliation, mourning for your sin. "Blessed are
   they that mourn, for they shall be comforted."

   Penitential sorrow works life into men. Only come to Jesus and tell Him
   you have sinned and are ashamed and gladly would cease to do evil and
   learn to do well. Come in all your misery and degradation, in all your
   consciousness of your Hell-deservedness. Come in sorrow to the Man of
   Sorrows who is even now on the road to meet you! He has said, "Him that
   comes to Me I will in no wise cast out," and He will not forfeit His
   Word. God bless these feeble words concerning the inner emotions of my
   Lord and may the Holy Spirit again rest upon us while we further pursue
   the subject into another field.

   II. We are now to consider OUR LORD'S VERBAL LAMENTATIONS. These are
   recorded in the following

   words--"Oh that you had known, even you, at least in this, your day,
   the things which belong unto your peace! But now they are hid from your
   eyes." First, notice He laments over the fault by which they
   perished--"Oh that you had known." Ignorance, willful ignorance, was
   their ruin. "Oh that you had known." They did not know what they might
   have known--what they ought to have known--they did not know their God.
   "The ox knows his owner and the ass his master's crib, but Israel does
   not know, My people do not consider."

   They knew not God! They knew not God's only Son! They knew not Him who
   came in mercy to them with nothing but love upon His lips! Oh, but this
   is the pity, that the Light of God is come into the world and men will
   not have it, but love darkness rather than Light. Alas, I fear that
   some of my hearers live in the Light and will not see. There are none
   so deaf as those that will not hear and none so blind as those that
   will not see--and yet there are such in all Christian
   con-gregations--who do not know and will not know. God says, "Oh that
   you had hearkened to My Commandments, then had your peace been as a
   river and your righteousness as the waves of the sea." Our Lord
   lamented over the inhabitants of Jerusalem because they hated knowledge
   and did not choose the fear of the Lord--they would have none of His
   coun-sel--they despised His reproof.

   Willful ignorance led to obstinate unbelief. They chose to die in the
   dark rather than accept the Light of the Son of God! The Lord laments
   the bliss which they had lost, the peace which could not be theirs, "Oh
   that you had known the things that belong unto your peace." The name of
   that city was, as we know, Jerusalem, which, being interpreted,
   signifies a vision of peace. They that looked upon it saw before them a
   vision of peace. But, alas, Jerusalem had lost its "salem," or peace,
   and become only a vision because she did not know and would not know
   her God! Oh men and women that know not God, you have lost peace! Even
   now you are like the troubled sea that cannot rest, whose waters cast
   up mire and dirt!

   "There is no peace, says my God, unto the wicked." Oh what joys you
   might have had! The delights of pardoned sin, the bliss of conscious
   safety, the joy of communion with God--the rapture of fellowship with
   Christ Jesus, the heavenly expectation of infinite Glory--all might
   have been yours! But you have put them away from you. The Lord says of
   you, as of Israel of old, "O that My people had hearkened unto Me and
   Israel had walked in My ways! I would soon have subdued their enemies
   and turned My hand upon their adversaries." God would have revealed to
   you, by His Spirit, brighter things than eyes have seen and sweeter
   joys than ears have heard--for if you had been willing and obedient you
   would have eaten the fat of the land of His promises! You are losers!
   You are awful losers by not being reconciled to God and you will be
   worse losers yet, for that false peace which now stands in the place of
   true peace and beguiles and fascinates you will depart like the mirage
   of the desert and leave you on the arid sands of despair to seek rest
   and find it not!

   Soon shall a terrible sound be in your ears of the approaching
   vengeance of God and there shall be for you no place of refuge. When
   the Lord thought of what they had lost, He cried, "Oh that you had
   known!" I feel ashamed to repeat His Words because I cannot repeat them
   in the tone He used. Oh, to hear Jesus say these words! I think it
   might melt a heart of stone! But no, I am mistaken, even that would not
   do it, for those who did hear Him were not melted nor reclaimed, but
   went on their way to their doom as they had done before! How hardened
   are the men who can trample on a

   Redeemer's tears! What wonder that they find a Hell where not a drop of
   water can ever cool their parched tongues tormented in the flames! If
   men are resolved to be damned, it is evident that the tears of the
   best, the most perfect of men cannot stop them! Woe is me! This is
   deeper cause for tears than all else besides, that men should be so
   desperately set on mischief that nothing but Omnipotence will stop them
   from eternal suicide!

   But our Lord also lamented over they who had lost peace. Observe that
   He says--"Oh that you had known, even you. You are Jerusalem, the
   favored city. It is little that Egypt did not know, that Tyre and Sidon
   did not know, but that you should not know!" Ah, Friends, if Jesus were
   here this morning, He might weep over some of you and say--"Oh that you
   had known, even you." You were a lovely child! Even in your earliest
   days you were fond of everything good and gracious! You were taken to
   the place of worship and sat on your mother's knee, pleased to be
   there. Do you remember the minister's name that you used to lisp with
   delight, the texts you repeated and the hymns you sang? You grew up to
   be a lad right full of promise and all felt sure that you would be a
   Christian.

   What exhortations your father, who is now in Heaven, gave you! And she
   that bore you and loved you till she passed away! How she prayed and
   pleaded for you! Some of you have been sitting here, or in some other
   place where Christ is preached, for a very long time and you have often
   been very near to the Kingdom and yet you are not in it. You have come
   right up to the edge of the border, but you have not crossed the line.
   You are not far from the Kingdom of God, but you lack one thing--the
   one essential point of decision for Christ--"Oh that you had known,
   even you!" You are always ready to help the cause of God with your
   purse, for you take an interest in every good work--you cannot bear
   blasphemy or infidelity--and yet you are not saved!

   There are a thousand things that are hopeful about you, but there is
   one thing which dampens our hope, for you always procrastinate and know
   not how to use your present opportunity. Jesus bids you use "this your
   day," but you linger and delay. Today is God's accepted time! Postpone
   no longer the hour of decision! Alas that you should perish! Shall the
   child of such a mother be lost? Shall the son of such a father be
   driven down to Hell? I cannot bear it! God have mercy on you, sons and
   daughters of Christian parents! You that have been enriched with
   Christian privileges, why will you die? Young man, so promising but yet
   so undecided, it makes the Savior, Himself, weep that you, even you,
   should still refuse to know the things that make for your peace!

   Our Lord wept because of the opportunity which they had neglected. He
   said, "At least in this, your day." It was such a favored day--they had
   been warned by holy men, but now they had the Son of God, Himself, to
   preach to them! It was a day of miracles of mercy, a day of the
   unveiling of Gospel Grace! And yet they would not have Christ though He
   had come so near to them and it was a day of merciful visitation such
   as other nations had not known. Perhaps today, also, may be a day of
   visitation for some of you. Shall we have to lament, "Oh that you had
   known, even you, at least in this, your day"--on this Lord's-Day, this
   day of power, this day of the Spirit? Oh, by His Grace, you now weep
   and I perceive you feel some tender touches of the Spirit's power! Do
   not resist Him and cause this day, also, to pass away unimproved!

   "The harvest is passed, the summer is ended and you are not saved." And
   has the autumn closed and shall the winter come and go and shall these
   days in which the Spirit visits men all depart till God shall declare
   that it does not become the dignity of His Spirit to always strive with
   flesh and, therefore, He shall cease His operations and leave men to
   their own devices? Oh, souls, I pray you think of Christ weeping
   because revival days and Sundays are being wasted by you! Do not, in
   these best of days, commit the worst of sins by still refusing to
   receive the Gospel of God! The Lord Jesus mourned, again, because He
   saw the blindness which had stolen over them. They had shut their eyes
   so fast that now they could not see--their ears which they had stopped
   had become dull and heavy--their hearts which they had hardened had
   waxen gross so that they could not see with their eyes, nor hear with
   their ears, nor feel in their hearts, nor be converted that He should
   heal them.

   Why, the Truth of God was as plain as the sun in the heavens and yet
   they could not see it! And so is the Gospel at this hour to many of you
   and yet you perceive it not. There is nothing plainer than the plan of
   salvation by looking unto Jesus and yet many men have gone on so long
   resisting the sweetness and Light of the Spirit of God that they
   cannot, now, see the Lord Jesus who is as the sun in the heavens! The
   kindest friends have put the Gospel before them in a way that has
   enlightened others, but it has not affected them. They still say, "I
   cannot see it!" O you blind ones, take heed lest

   this has come upon you, "Behold, you despisers and wonder and perish."
   Christ groans because the timings which belonged to the peace of
   Jerusalem were hid from their eyes as a punishment for refusing to see.

   Lastly, we know that the great floodgates of Christ's grief were pulled
   up because of the ruin which He foresaw. It is worth any man's while to
   read the story of the destruction of Jerusalem as it is told by
   Josephus--it is the most harrowing of all records written by human pen!
   It remains the tragedy of tragedies! There never was and there never
   will be anything comparable to it. The people died of famine and of
   pestilence and fell by thousands beneath the swords of their own
   countrymen. Women devoured the flesh of their own children and men
   raged against each other with the fury of beasts. All ills seemed to
   meet in that doomed city! It was filled within with horrors and
   surrounded without by terrors. There was no escape, neither would the
   frenzied people accept mercy.

   The city itself was the banqueting hall of death. Josephus says, "All
   hope of escaping was now cut off from the Jews, together with their
   liberty of going out of the city. Then did the famine widen its
   progress and devour the people by whole houses and families. The upper
   rooms were full of women and infants that were dying by famine and the
   lanes of the city were full of the dead bodies of the aged. The
   children, also, and the young men wandered about the market places like
   shadows, all swelled with the famine and fell down dead wherever their
   misery seized them. For a time the dead were buried, but afterwards,
   when they could not do that, they had them cast down from the wall into
   the valleys beneath. When Titus, on going his rounds along these
   valleys, saw them full of dead bodies and the thick putrefaction
   running about them, he gave a groan and, spreading out his hands to
   Heaven, called God to witness this was not his doing."

   There is nothing in history to exceed this horror! But even this is
   nothing compared with the destruction of a soul. A man might look with
   complacency upon a dying body if he knew that within it was a soul that
   would live eternally in bliss and cause the body to rise again to equal
   joy. But for a soul to die is a catastrophe so terrible that the
   heavens might be clothed with sackcloth for its funeral! There is a
   death which never ends! The separation of the soul from God--which is
   the most complete of all deaths! The separation of the soul from the
   body is but, as it were, a prelude and type of the far more dreadful
   death--the separation of the soul from God. Banished from hope,
   existing but not living and that forever! What a condition this must
   be!

   I shall draw no picture. Words fail but, oh, my Hearers, shall it be
   that anyone among you shall always know the meaning of the Savior's
   words--"These shall go away into everlasting punishment"? Will it ever
   be your lot to hear Him say--you who hear me this day, I mean--"Depart,
   you cursed, into everlasting fire in Hell, prepared for the devil and
   his angels"? If we could mark any here to whom this doom will happen,
   we might make a ring around them and bring them home tearing our
   garments and tearing our hair, for it would be a far greater grief than
   if we knew that they would die by the sword or by famine in a foreign
   land! All ills are trifles compared with the second death!

   Bear with me just a moment while, in conclusion, I set forth our
   Savior's grief as it expressed itself in other words, for those other
   words may help us to fresh light. You remember the passage in the 23rd
   of Matthew which I read in your hearing, where the Lord said, "O
   Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that kill the Prophets and stone them which
   are sent unto you, how often would I have gathered your children
   together, even as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings and you
   would not!"? Do you see His Grace and grief? These people killed the
   Prophets and yet the Lord of Prophets would have gathered them! His
   love had gone so far that even Prophet-killers He would have gathered!
   Is not this amazing that there should be Grace enough in Christ to
   gather adulterers, thieves, liars and to forgive and change them and
   yet they will not be gathered? That Jesus should be willing, even, to
   gather such base ones into a place of salvation and yet should be
   refused?

   The pith of it lies in this--"How often would I have gathered your
   children together, even as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings and
   you would not." See, here, the case stands thus--I would, but you would
   not. This is a grief to love. If it had been a fact that Christ would
   not, then I could not understand His tears, but when He says "I would,
   but you would not," then I see the deep reason of His anguish! The
   failure of will is in you that perish, not in Christ who cries, "I
   would, but you would not." Yes and He adds, "How often would I." Not
   once was He in a merciful mood and pitiful to sinners for that time,
   alone, but He cries, "How often would I have gathered."

   Every Prophet that had come to them had indicated an opportunity for
   their being gathered and every time that Jesus preached there was a
   door set open for their salvation, but they would not be gathered and
   so He foretells their fate in these words--"Your house shall be left
   unto you desolate." Here is a painful sentence. Set the two words in
   con-

   trast--"Gathered," that is what you might have been! "Desolate," that
   is what you shall be--and Jesus weeps because of it! "Gathered"--it is
   such a beautiful picture! You see the little chicks fleeing from danger
   when they hear the cluck of the mother hen. They gather together and
   they come under her wings.

   Did you ever hear that little, pretty cry they make when they are all
   together with their heads buried in the feathers? How warm and
   comfortable they are! This is where you might have been, gathered under
   the warm breast of the eternal God, feeling His love with the rest of
   the people--joying and rejoicing in a communion of complete security!
   But inasmuch as you would not be gathered, see what you will
   be--"desolate," without a friend, without a helper. Then you will call
   to the saints, but they will not be able to help you. Say to them,
   "Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out"-- but they must
   refuse you. Unto which of the holy ones will you turn? What angel will
   have pity upon you? Each cherub waves his fiery sword to keep you from
   the gate of Paradise. There is no help for you in God when once you die
   without Him! No help for you anywhere.

   Desolate! Desolate! Desolate! Because you would not be gathered! Well
   does the tender Savior weep over men since they will perversely choose
   such a doom! I do not feel as if I should close in gloom. I must flash
   before you a brighter light, though it is but for the last minute. The
   day hastens on when Christ will come a second time and then He shall
   behold a new Jerusalem, a spiritual Jerusalem, built by Divine hands.
   The foundations thereof are of jewels and the gates thereof are of
   pearl. How He will rejoice over it! He shall rest in His love and He
   shall rejoice over it with singing! He will shed no tears, then, but He
   will see in the Jerusalem from above the travail of His soul and He
   shall be satisfied. When Zion shall be built up, the Lord shall appear
   in His Glory and the marriage of the Lamb will have come.

   Meanwhile, if any one of you who are not yet saved will come to Jesus,
   He will rejoice over you, for He takes pleasure in the stones of Zion
   and favors the dust, there, and if you are as little as Zion's dust and
   as mean as her rubbish, He will rejoice over you! It is written that,
   "There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that
   repents." Now, angels stand in the Presence of the Lord Jesus and there
   is joy in His heart over a single penitent! If only one sinner shall
   repent because of this sermon, my Lord will rejoice over Him! I, His
   servant, am, in my measure, intensely glad when a soul repents, but He
   shall have the chief joy, for His is the chief love!

   Who will now come to Jesus? Would to God it might be the beloved son of
   a godly mother! Would to God it might be you, my long hesitating
   Hearer, for years a hearer but not a doer of the Word. May the Holy
   Spirit decide you at this very moment! Amen.

The Joy Of Jesus

   (No. 1571)

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 5, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said, I thank You, O Father,
   Lord of Heaven and earth, that You have hid these things from the wise
   and prudent and have revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so
   it seemed good in Your sight. All things are delivered to Me of My
   Father: and no man knows who the Son is, but the Father; and who the
   Father is, but the Son and He to whom the Son will reveal Him." Luke
   10:21,22.

   LAST Lord's-Day morning we considered the lamentations of Jesus. [#1570
   - The Lamentations of Jesus.] We will now turn our thoughts to the joys
   of Jesus. It is remarkable that this is the only instance on record in
   the Gospels in which our Lord is said to have rejoiced. It stands alone
   and is, therefore, the more to be prized--"In that hour Jesus rejoiced
   in spirit." He was the "Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief for
   our sakes and, therefore, we are not astonished to find few indications
   of joy in the story of His life. Yet I do not think it would be fair to
   infer from the fact of a solitary mention of His rejoicing that He did
   not rejoice at other times. On the contrary, our Lord must, despite His
   sorrow, have possessed a peaceful, happy spirit.

   He was infinitely benevolent and went about doing good--and benevolence
   always finds a quiet delight in blessing others. The joy of the lame
   when they leaped and of the blind when they saw must have gladdened the
   soul of Jesus. To cause happiness to others must bring home to a
   sympathetic bosom some degree of pleasure. Sir Philip Sydney was known
   to say, "Doing good is the only certainly happy action of a man's
   life," and assuredly it is hard to see how the love of Jesus could
   refrain from rejoicing in blessing those around Him. Moreover, our Lord
   was so pure that He had a well of joy within which could not fail Him.
   If it is, indeed, true that virtue is true happiness, then Jesus of
   Nazareth was happy. The poet said--

   "What nothing earthly gives, or can destroy, The soul's calm sunshine
   and the heartfelt joy, Is virtue's prize."

   Such calm and joy must have been the Savior's, though, for our sake, He
   bowed beneath the heavy load of sorrow.

   The perfectly holy God is the perfectly happy God and the perfectly
   holy Christ, had it not been that He had taken upon Himself our griefs
   and sicknesses, would have been perfectly happy. And even with our
   griefs and sicknesses there must have been a deep peace of soul within
   Him which sustained Him in His deepest woe. Did not the Father,
   Himself, say of His beloved Son, "You love righteousness and hate
   wickedness: therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of
   gladness above Your fellows"? Nor is this all, for our blessed Lord
   lived in unbroken fellowship with the Father and fellowship with God
   will not permit a soul to abide in darkness for, walking with God, He
   walks in the Light as God is in the Light. Such a mind may, for certain
   purposes, come under clouds and glooms, but the Light of God is sown
   for the righteous and it will speedily break forth as the dawn of day.

   Those nights of prayer and days of perfect service must have brought
   their own calm to the tried heart of the Son of God. Besides, Christ
   Jesus was a Man of faith--He was faith's highest exposition and
   example. He is "the Author and the Finisher of faith," in whom we see
   its life, walk and triumph. Our Lord was the Incarnation of perfect
   confidence in the Father--in His life all the histories of great
   Believers are summed up. Read the 11th chapter of Hebrews and see the
   great cloud of witnesses and then mark how, in the 12th chapter, Paul
   bids us look to Jesus as though in His Person the whole multitude of
   the witnesses could be seen!

   He it was, who, "for the joy that was set before Him endured the Cross,
   despising the shame." His faith must, therefore, have anticipated the
   reward of His passion and have brought the joy there home to Him even
   while He sorrowed

   here. His joy was a light from the lamps of the future which were to be
   kindled by His death and victory! He had meat to eat that His disciples
   knew not of for His long-sighted eyes saw further than they and while
   they mourned His departure, He saw the expediency of it and told them
   that if they loved Him they would rejoice because He was going to the
   Father! Be sure of this, that our Lord felt, beneath the great floods
   of outward affliction, an under-current of joy, for He said, "These
   things have I spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in you and that
   your joy might be full."

   What did He mean by this if He had no joy in His people? Could He have
   spoken so many happy words and so often have said to His disciples, "Be
   of good cheer," if He had been always downcast? But it is still
   remarkable that our text should be the only recorded instance of His
   joy, so far as the Evangelists are concerned. It is clear that joy was
   not a distinguishing feature in our Lord's life so as to strike the
   beholder. Peace may have sat serenely on His brow, but nothing of the
   exuberant spirits which are seen in some men, for His countenance was
   marred with lines of care and grief.

   We do not hear that He laughed, though it is thrice recorded that He
   wept and here, for once, as quite unique, we find the Inspired
   assurance that He rejoiced. Because of its singularity, the record
   deserves to be looked into with care that we may see the cause of
   delight so unusual. The words here used are very emphatic. "He
   rejoiced." The Greek word is much stronger than the English
   rendering--it signifies "to leap for joy." It is the word of the
   blessed Virgin's song, "My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior."
   Strong emotions of delight were visible upon our Lord's face and were
   expressed by the tones of His voice as well as by His Words.

   It is clear that He was greatly glad. The text also says, He "rejoiced
   in spirit," that is, deep down in the very center of His Nature--in
   that largest and most capacious part of His human being, the Redeemer
   rejoiced! Man is body, soul and spirit, but the spirit is the nobler
   and most vital part and it was with a spiritual, inward and most living
   joy that the Lord Jesus Christ rejoiced. It was joy of the truest and
   fullest sort which made the Savior's heart dance! Let us come, then,
   near to this rejoicing Savior who wraps the garments of praise about
   Him, perfumed with delight! Let us see if we cannot learn something
   from His joys, since, I trust, we gathered something from His griefs.

   I. First, let us look at our Lord and note that His joy was JOY IN THE
   FATHER'S REVELATION OF THE GOSPEL. "I thank You, O Father, that You
   have hid these things from the wise and prudent and have revealed them
   unto babes." He rejoices in His Father's revelation of the Gospel! It
   was not joy in the fame which had gathered about His name insomuch that
   John heard of it in prison. It was not joy in the manifest tokens of
   power that went forth with His commissioners, though they rejoiced that
   devils were subject unto them. No, it was joy in God's revealing the
   Gospel to the sons of men!

   I call your attention to the fact that He ascribed all that was done to
   the Father and rejoiced that the Father was working with Him. His
   disciples came back to Him and said, "Even the devils are subject unto
   us through Your name." And they spoke not amiss, for the name of Jesus
   was their strength and deserved honor. But the Lord, with that sacred
   self-abnegation which was so natural to Him, replies, "I thank You, O
   Father, that You have revealed these things." He takes no honor unto
   Himself, but ascribes the Glory unto the Father who worked with Him.
   Imitate Him, O you who call Him Lord! Let the work of the Father be
   your joy!

   If God gives us any success in the preaching of the Gospel, let our joy
   be that the Father's power is going forth with His Word! We are not so
   much to joy in our instrumentality as in the hand which uses the
   instrument and works by it. Oh, misery! Misery! To be attempting Gospel
   ministry without God! But oh, bliss, unspeakable bliss to feel that
   when we lift our hand, God's hand is lifted, too, and when we speak the
   Word, the voice of God is ringing through our feeble speech and
   reaching the hearts of men! It is to true Believers a great joy that
   the Father is bringing home His wandering children and receiving
   penitents into His bosom!

   The Savior's joy was that through the Father's Grace men were being
   enlightened. The 70 disciples had been from city to city, working
   miracles and preaching the Gospel and their Master was glad when they
   returned with tidings of success--"In that hour Jesus rejoiced in
   spirit." It pleases Jesus when the Gospel has free course and God is
   glorified thereby. Then, in a measure, He sees of the travail of His
   soul and is filled with satisfaction. Shall we not find our joy where
   He finds His? Shall we not enter into the joy of our Lord? Whenever we
   hear good news of a village evangelized, of a township moved by the
   glad tidings, of a country long shut up from the Gospel at last opened
   to the Word of God, let us feel our highest and deepest joy!

   Rather let us rejoice in this than in business prosperity or personal
   advantage. What if we can find no joy in our own circumstances? What if
   even spiritual affairs within our soul are full of difficulty? Let us
   joy and rejoice that God the Father is revealing the Light of His
   Gospel among the sons of men! Be this our highest wish, "Your kingdom
   come," and in that coming kingdom let us find our utmost happiness! Be
   sure that the joy which warmed the heart of Christ can do us no
   harm--it must be a pure, sacred and ennobling joy and, therefore, let
   us indulge in it very largely! Christ's joy lay in the Father's sending
   forth His Light and His Truth--making men to see things which Prophets
   and kings had desired to behold, but had not been favored to see. Jesus
   rejoiced in this, that the blessings of Divine Grace were being
   revealed by the Father!

   Further, our Savior's joy lay very much in this, that this revelation
   to men was being made through such humble instruments. We read that,
   "He lifted up His eyes on His disciples and said, Blessed be you poor:
   for yours is the kingdom of God." There was not among the 12 or the 70,
   one person of any social status. They were the common people of the
   field and the sea. In later years Paul was raised up--a man richly
   endowed in learning, whose great abilities were used by the Lord--but
   the first ministers of Christ were a band of fishermen and countrymen,
   altogether unknown in the schools of learning and regarded as
   "unlearned and ignorant men."

   The grandest era in the world's history was ushered in by nobodies! By
   persons who, like their Leader, were despised and rejected of men! To
   any one of them it might have been said, "For you see your calling,
   brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty,
   not many noble, are called: but God has chosen the foolish things of
   the world to confound the wise and God has chosen the weak things of
   the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of
   the world and things which are despised, has God chosen, yes, and
   things which are not, to bring to nothing things that are: that no
   flesh should glory in His Presence."

   Observe carefully that the persons whom our Lord had been employing
   were not only obscure in origin, but they were of a low degree of
   spiritual understanding. They were, in fact, babes in Grace as well as
   worldly wisdom! Their joy, when they came back to tell what had been
   done, was evidently childish as well as gracious. They rejoiced in
   their success as children do in their little achievements. But their
   Lord was thankful because He saw the open-heartedness and the
   simplicity of their characters in the gladsome way in which they cried,
   "Lord, even the devils are subject to us through Your name." And He
   thanked God that by such babes as these, such children, such
   true-hearted children and yet such mere children, He was pleased to
   make known His Word among the sons of men!

   Rest you sure that our Lord, even at this day, finds a delight in the
   weakness of the instruments He uses--

   "He takes the fool and makes him know The mysteries of His Grace; To
   bring aspiring wisdom low, And all its pride abase."

   Not you, you scribes who have counted every letter of the Old
   Testament, does He elect to be filled with the Spirit! Not you, you
   Pharisees who so abound in outward religion, does He choose to spread
   the inward Life and Light! Not you, you Sadducees who are versed in
   skeptical philosophy and boast your cleverness, does He call to preach
   His Gospel to the poor! He has taken to be the heralds of His Glory men
   from the sea of Galilee whom you despise--simple-hearted men ready to
   learn--and then as ready to proclaim, again, the message of salvation!
   Our Lord was by no means displeased with the absence of culture and
   learning in His followers, for the culture and learning of the period
   were utter vanity!

   He was glad to see that they did not pretend to wisdom or astuteness,
   but came to Him in all simplicity to accept His teaching because they
   believed Him to be the Son of God. Jesus rejoiced in spirit about this.
   And yet, further, His great joy was that the converts were of such a
   character as they were. "You have hid these things from the wise and
   prudent and have revealed them unto babes." It is true that certain
   persons sneeringly asked, "Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees
   believed in Him?" There were some who thought little of Jesus because
   those whom they imagined to be learned men had not expressed their
   approval of His cause. Our Lord, Himself, had no concern in that
   direction, but called the Pharisees blind and the scribes hypocrites,
   as they assuredly were!

   Other voices may have inquired, "Who are these that follow Jesus? Of
   what class are His converts?" The answer would have been, "They are
   rustics, fishermen and common people with, here and there, a woman of
   substance and a man of means. The bulk of them are the poor to whom,
   for the first time, the Gospel is preached. Such have gathered to
   Christ and received His Word." Some even said that a parcel of boys and
   girls were in the streets crying, "Hosanna," and this

   showed how commonplace the Preacher was. At this day I have heard the
   Lord's people spoken of as a poor set of people of no position--a lot
   of persons whose names will never be known--a mere assembly of Jack,
   Tom, Harry, Mary, Susan and the rest.

   This was the very thing to which Jesus refers with thankfulness! He was
   glad that He was surrounded by unsophisticated, childlike natures,
   rather than by Pharisees and scribes who, even if they are converted,
   are sure to bring some of their old manners with them. He was glad that
   the Father had revealed His Light and His salvation to those who were
   lowly and humble, who, though poor in this world, were "rich in faith,
   giving glory to God." Thus you see that the very fact which certain
   very superior people fling in our teeth as a disgrace, was to our
   Savior a subject of joy! I have heard foolish ones sneer at certain
   Churches which are earnest for the Truth of God by affectedly asking,
   "Who are they? A mob of common people, tradesmen or working men and the
   like. Are there any of the aristocracy among them? Do you find any of
   the highly intellectual in their ranks?"

   What if we do not? We shall not, therefore, sorrow, but join with Jesus
   in saying, "We thank You, O Father, that You have hid these things from
   the wise and prudent and have revealed them unto babes." Christ found
   Himself at home among those open-hearted folks that gathered around
   Him, for He was, Himself, a Child-Man, who wore His heart upon His
   sleeve, boasting of no wisdom though He was Wisdom itself! Our Lord
   never sought Himself, as the wise and prudent of His age did. He was
   meek and lowly in heart and, therefore, found Himself at home among a
   people who were willing to receive His teaching and eager to proclaim
   it, again, to their countrymen. And so He blessed and praised God that
   such were chosen.

   Oh, Friends, it is not that Christ would not have the greatest come to
   Him! It is not that Christ would not have the learned come to Him! But
   so it is that His greatest joy is that those come who, whatever the
   greatness or the littleness of their learning, are childlike in spirit
   and, like babes, are willing to learn and prepared to receive what He
   shall teach them! He was glad to receive persons with lowly notions of
   their own intelligence and a supreme belief in the veracity of their
   great Teacher. If those who are reckoned to be learned, profess to come
   to Christ, they are generally a trial to the Church. All the merely
   human learning that has ever come unto the Church has, as a rule, been
   mischievous to it--and it always needs great Grace to keep it in its
   right place.

   At first came the Gnostics with their philosophy and into what perils
   they dragged the Church of God, I cannot stop to tell you! Then arose
   others out of whose wisdom grew Arianism and the Church was well-near
   withered to her very heart by that deadly form of heresy! The schoolmen
   did for her much the same and to this day whenever any of the
   would-be-thought-wise men meddle with religion, they tell us that the
   plain Word of God, as we read it, must be interpreted by modern thought
   and that it bears another meaning which only the cultured can possibly
   comprehend. When philosophy invades the domain of Revelation, it ends
   in perverting the Gospel and in bringing in "another gospel which is
   not another."

   It is with human wisdom as it is with human riches--how difficult shall
   they that have it enter into the Kingdom of God! True wisdom is another
   thing--that is a gift which comes from above and causes no puffing up
   of the heart, for it adores the God from whom it came! The wisdom which
   is true and real, the Lord is prepared to give to those who confess
   their ignorance--to those who will be babes in His sight. It is not
   ignorance which God loves, but conceit that He hates! Knowledge is
   good, but the affectation of it is evil! O for more true wisdom! May
   God give us much of it and may those who are babes, as yet, come to be
   men of full stature in Christ Jesus! Yet forget not your Lord's joy in
   the character of His converts, but remember the lines in which the poet
   of the sanctuary paraphrases our text--

   "Jesus, the man of constant grief,

   A mourner all His days,

   His Spirit once rejoiced aloud,

   And turned His joy to praise.

   Father, I thank Your wondrous love,

   That has revealed Your Son

   To men unlearned and to babes

   Has made Your Gospel known.

   The mysteries of redeeming Grace

   Are hidden from the wise,

   While pride and carnal reasoning join To swell and blind their eyes."

   Our Lord's joy sprang from one other source, namely, His view of the
   manner in which God was pleased to save His people. It was by revealing
   these things to them. There is, then, to every man who is saved, a
   revelation, not of anything over and above what is given us in the Word
   of God, but of that same Truth of God to himself, personally, and with
   power. In the Word of God is the Light of God, but what is needed is
   that each man's eyes should be opened by the finger of God to see it!
   Truth in the Scriptures will never save till it becomes the Truth of
   God in the heart--it must be "revealed" unto the most unprejudiced and
   true-hearted.

   Even men of childlike spirits and receptive natures will not see the
   Truth unless it is especially revealed to them. There must be a work of
   the Father through the Holy Spirit upon each intellect and mind before
   it can perceive the Truth of God as it is in Jesus. Therefore, when
   unregenerate men tell us that they cannot see the beauty of the Gospel,
   we are not at all astonished--we never thought they could! And likewise
   with boastful men of "culture, for we knew that they would say so!
   Blind men are little pleased with color and deaf men care little for
   music. Human wisdom cannot make a man without eyes see the Light of
   God!

   What do you know about the Gospel, oh you blinded wise men? What judges
   can you be of the Light of Revelation who seal up your eyes with the
   mud of your own cleverness and then say you cannot see? Christ never
   intended that you should! He will only reveal Himself as He pleases and
   He has pleased to do this to another kind of persons from what you are.
   Oh, you that are wise in your own conceit, the gate of true Wisdom is
   barred against you! You cannot, by searching, discover God and when He
   graciously reveals Himself you refuse to see Him and, therefore, it is
   just that you should perish in the dark! Well do you deserve this
   judgment. Let justice be done!

   That God had been pleased to reveal Himself to many through the
   preaching of the 70 was a great joy to Jesus and let us also rejoice
   whenever God reveals Himself to men! Let us be glad when one who is
   simple in heart is made a child by Divine Grace through being born
   again. Let us, furthermore, rejoice whenever conversion is worked by
   instruments that cannot possibly claim the glory of it. Let us praise
   and bless God that salvation is His own work from first to last! Come,
   all you who love the Father and say, with the great Firstborn, "I thank
   You, O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, that You have hid these things
   from the wise and prudent and have revealed them unto babes. Even so,
   Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight."

   II. I have thus tried, as far as I am able, to explain the cause of the
   Savior's joy. I would now call your attention to HIS MODE OF EXPRESSING
   THAT JOY. I have noticed some kind ofjoy in conversions which has not
   been wise in its expression, but has savored of glorying in the flesh.
   "Oh, we have had a wonderful time, we have had a blessed season! We
   have been visited by those dear men and we have exerted ourselves in
   downright earnest to get up a revival. We have done wonders." Such talk
   will not do! Hear how the Savior speaks. His joy finds tongue in
   thanksgiving--"I thank You, O Father." He ascribes the work to the
   Father and then renders all the praise to Him. This is the eloquence of
   joy--"I thank You, O Father."

   Brothers and Sisters, whenever you are happy sing hymns of
   thanksgiving! "Is any merry? Let him sing Psalms." The most fit
   language for joy, whether it is on earth or in Heaven, is adoration and
   thanksgiving to God! Blessed be the name of the Lord that we are
   gladdened in the harvest field of Christian work, for it is He that
   gives Seed to the sower and causes the Word to spring up and bring
   forth fruit a hundred-fold. Our Lord found expression for His joy in
   declaring the Father's sovereignty. "I thank You, O Father, Lord of
   Heaven and earth." Some shrink back from the idea of God as Lord of all
   things above and below. To them the free will of man seems the greatest
   of all facts and, lest there should be the slightest intrusion upon
   man's domain, they would have God limited as to His absolute power.

   To magnify man they would minimize God! You will hear them talking
   against those of us who magnify Divine Sovereignty and imputing to us
   the notion of a certain arbitrariness in God, although such a thought
   has never entered our minds! Jehovah, who gives no account of His
   matters, but orders all things according to the good pleasure of His
   will, is never arbitrary, unjust, or tyrannical--and yet He is absolute
   and uncontrolled--a Sovereign who reigns by His own self-existent
   power. He is, Himself, the source and origin of all law. He can be
   trusted with absolute Sovereignty because He is Infinite Love and
   Infinite Goodness. I will go the utmost length as to the absolute
   supremacy of God and His right to do as He wills and especially to do
   as He wills with His own, which Gospel Grace most certainly is.

   He will have mercy on whom He will have mercy and He will have
   compassion on whom He will have compassion and none can stay His hand
   or say unto Him, "What are You doing?" When Christ was most glad He
   expressed that gladness by ascribing unto God an Infinite Sovereignty
   and shall that Truth of God be gloomy to us? No, rather we will, each
   one, view the work of the Father's Grace and cry, "I thank You, O
   Father and I thank You all the more because I know that You are Lord of
   Heaven and earth!" If I am addressing any who quarrel with the doctrine
   of the Sovereignty of God, I would advise them to cease their
   rebellion, for "the Lord reigns." Let them at least go as far as the
   Psalm, "Let the people tremble" even if they cannot go a little further
   and sing, "The Lord reigns; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of
   isles be glad thereof."

   Power and rule are best in the hands of the great Jehovah who always
   links together, in His own single Character both Fatherhood and
   Sovereignty. "I thank You, O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth." Dismiss
   from your minds all caricatures of the doctrine and receive it in its
   purest form--"the Lord is king forever and ever. Hallelujah!" Your joy,
   if it is deeply spiritual and very great, will never find room enough
   for the sweep of its Atlantic waves till you delight yourself in the
   absolute supremacy of God. The deep groundswell of delight within the
   Redeemer's soul could find no grander space over which it could expand
   its force than the unlimited power and dominion of the Lord of Heaven
   and earth-- whose key it is which opens or shuts the kingdom of
   Heaven--whose Word it is which hides or reveals the things of eternity!

   Our Lord delighted in the special act of Sovereignty which was before
   Him, that the Lord had "hid these things from the wise and prudent and
   had revealed them unto babes." He communed with God in it! He took
   pleasure in it and said, "Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in
   Your sight." His voice, as it were, went with the Father's voice. He
   agreed with the Father's choice, He rejoiced in it, He triumphed in it!
   The will of the Father was the will of Christ and He had fellowship
   with the Father in every act of His Sovereign choice, yes, He magnified
   God for it in His inmost spirit! He says, "Even so, Father, for so it
   seemed good in Your sight," for He knew that what seems good to God
   must be good. Some things seem good to us which are evil--but that
   which seems good to God is good!

   Jesus praises God about it for no other reason than it is God's good
   pleasure that it should be so. Oh, what a state of heart it will be for
   you and me to get into when we can express our highest joy by a perfect
   acquiescence in the will of God, whatever that will may be! See here,
   Brothers and Sisters, the road to contentment, to peace, to happiness,
   yes, heavenly life this side of the grave! If you ever come to feel
   that what pleases God pleases you, you will be glad, even, in
   affliction and tribulation!

   If your heart is ever schooled down to accept as your will that which
   is God's will and to believe anything to be good because God thinks it
   good, then you may go through the rest of your days singing and waiting
   till your Lord takes you to His bosom! Soon will you rise to the place
   where all the singers meet and sing forever unto God and the Lamb--all
   self and rebellion being forever banished. Herein, then, Christ found a
   channel for His joy--in thanksgiving, in magnifying the Divine
   Sovereignty, in having communion with it and in delighting in it!

   III. Thirdly and briefly, I want you to see OUR LORD'S EXPLANATION OF
   THE FATHER'S ACT. The Father had been pleased to hide these things from
   the wise and prudent and to reveal them unto babes. And Jesus Christ is
   perfectly satisfied with that order of things, quite content with the
   kind of converts He has and the kind of preachers that God had given
   Him. For, first, the Lord Jesus does not need prestige. Read the 22nd
   verse--"All things are delivered to Me of My Father." A mere pretender,
   when he begins to prophesy and set himself up for a religious
   leader--how pleased he is when some learned doctor endorses his claims!
   If some man of wealth and station comes to his side, how he plumes
   himself!

   The Savior of our souls sought no such aids. The verdict of the world's
   literary intelligentsia could not make His Word more truthful than it
   is, nor more convincing, for its power lies in the Spirit which reveals
   it. If great men say "Yes," they will not make His doctrine more sure!
   Nor will they make it less truthful if they all say, "No." Prestige for
   Christ? It is blasphemy to think of such a thing! "All things," He
   says, "are delivered to Me of My Father." High Priests and leaders of
   religion denounce Him, but all things are delivered to Him of His
   Father! The Sanhedrim determines to put Him down, but all things are
   delivered to Him of the Father! The learned deride His claims to be the
   Messiah! What does it matter to Christ? The Father has committed all
   things into His hands! He stands alone and asks for no allies. His own
   power, unborrowed and unaided, is quite sufficient for His purposes.

   Do you think, Brothers and Sisters, that we are going to stop our
   preaching of the Gospel until we shall have the so-called "culture and
   intellect" of the age upon our side to say, "It is even so"? Not we!
   But rather do we believe God in the teeth of the wiseacres and say,
   "Let God be true and every man a liar!" Jesus needs no imprimatur from
   scholars, no patronage from princes, no apologies from orators! The
   pomp and power and wisdom and cunning of the world were not with Him
   and He thanks God that He is not encumbered with such doubtful gain,
   but that this Truth has been revealed to those who are not wise in
   their own eyes, nor intelligent in their own esteem, but, like
   children, willing to learn from God and glad to believe all that He
   reveals!

   See how the Lord explains it further, by showing that human wisdom
   cannot discover God. "No man knows who the Son is but the Father and
   who the Father is but the Son." No man though he is a master in Israel!
   Men of science may puzzle their brains and with great ingenuity they
   may try to thread the intricacies of the unknown, but they must err
   from the truth if they refuse the Revelation of God! Such a thing as
   natural religion, spontaneously born of man's intellect, does not
   exist. "Oh," you say, "surely there is much of it!" I say that whatever
   is truly religious in it was borrowed from Revelation and has been
   handed down by tradition! Talk of comparative religions--there is but
   one and the other pretenders have stolen certain of its clothes.

   Men see, no doubt, much of God in Nature, but they would not have done
   so had there been no Revelation. First came the Light through
   Revelation and then, afterwards, when men saw it reflected from various
   objects, they dreamed that the Light came out of the reflectors! Men
   hear something of revealed Truth and when their thoughts run in that
   line, that which they have heard is awakened in their minds and they
   think themselves the inventors. God is not known except as He reveals
   Himself, nor can He be discovered by human ingenuity! Carnal wit and
   thought tend not that way, but tend from God unto blackest darkness.
   God is ONLY to be known THROUGH CHRIST, so the text says--"No man knows
   who the Father is but the Son and He to whom the Son will reveal Him."

   As the light, after God had created it, was lodged in the sun, so is
   all knowledge of God treasured up in Christ as the Sun of
   Righteousness. He it is that in Himself has Light, the Light that
   lightens every man that comes into the world, if he is lightened at
   all. We must receive Christ or abide in darkness! Yes, and the Light
   which is in Christ is not perceptible by any man except by revelation.
   What does the text say?--"No man knows who the Son is, but the Father;
   and who the Father is, but the Son and He to whom the Son will reveal
   Him." There must be a special and distinct revelation of Christ and of
   the Father by Christ to each man, or else he will remain in blindness
   to the day of his death. The power, then, which lies in merely human
   wisdom is a force which often hinders men from coming under the
   influence of revelation. Only by revelation can they know and by a
   revelation personally receive.

   But the man is so wise that he does not want to be taught--he can find
   it out for himself. Yield himself to an Infallible Book or an
   Infallible Spirit? Not he! Well, then, because of his very wisdom, he
   becomes incapable of learning! Truth to tell, what is human wisdom? The
   supposed wisdom of man is folly--that is the short for it all. They
   write a history, sometimes, of religious thought and of the various
   phases through which Christianity has gone and on this they ground
   remarks! But I should like somebody to write a truthful history of
   philosophy. The history of philosophy is a record of the insanities of
   mankind--a catalog of lunacies! You shall see one generation of
   philosophers busily engaged in refuting those that went before them and
   doing it very well, indeed!

   But what will the next generation do? Why, refute this one! The
   philosophies that were current 100 years ago are all exploded, now, and
   all the teachings of today, except such as are clear matters of fact,
   will be exploded before I go down to my grave if I live to be
   gray-headed! There is not a philosopher now living that can be sure but
   what there is some other fact to yet be discovered which will upset
   every hypothesis that he has sent forth into the world! Philosophers
   who conceitedly glory over believers in Revelation are fools, for they
   know nothing with certainty and absolute certainty appertains only to
   Divine Revelation! In those who pretend to wisdom apart from God, folly
   abounds. There is no light in them, nor in any man except that which
   comes from the Spirit of God.

   That wisdom which sets itself up apart from God is atheism, because God
   knows and He says to man, "I will teach you. I will reveal Myself to
   you by My Son." But that wisdom says, "We do not want to be taught--we
   know by ourselves." Then you are a rival to God! You pretend to be
   superior to God since you are not willing to learn of Him, but will
   rather trust yourself. This folly and this atheism are the reasons why
   God hides His mind from the wise and the

   clever--they reject Him and, therefore, He gives them over to a
   judicial blindness and Christ thanks Him that He does, for it is but
   justice that He should do so.

   When the Lord is pleased to give to any man a childlike spirit, then is
   he on the road to knowledge. This is true even in science, itself. The
   secrets of Nature will never be revealed to the man who believes that
   he already knows them. Nature herself does not teach the man who comes
   to her with prejudice. A man who thinks he knows beforehand, sits down
   to study Nature and what does he generally discover? Well, he learnedly
   dreams of a universal solvent, or that the baser metals can be
   transmuted into gold, or that there is a perpetual motion. Those, you
   say, are things philosophers believed years ago. Yes, but their
   theories of today are just as stupid and the science of today will be
   the jest of the next century!

   The greatest absurdities have been the pets of philosophy for hundreds
   of years and why was it that men did not know better? Because they did
   not go to Nature and ask her to teach them what was fact--they made an
   hypothesis and then they went to Nature to force her to prove it, as
   they do now. They start with a prejudgment of what they would like to
   be and then take facts and twist them round into their system and so
   they blind themselves by their own wisdom! Well, if it is so in Nature
   and I am sure it is, it is certainly more so in Grace, for when a man
   comes to the Word of God and says, "Now, I know theology beforehand. I
   do not come here to find my creed in the Bible and learn it like a
   child, but I come to turn texts about and make them fit into my
   system." Well, he will blind himself and will be a fool and it is right
   he should be blinded, for has he not done that willfully which must of
   necessity lead to such an end?

   Brethren, simple teachableness is the first essential for the reception
   of a Revelation from God and if you have it today, if you are seeking
   after the Truth of God, if you are crying after her and if you are
   willing that God should reveal her to you--if you are anxious that He
   should reveal His Truth to you in Christ--you are the sort of person
   upon whom God in Sovereignty looks with Divine favor and unto such as
   you will He reveal Himself. What is needed is faith, a childlike,
   receptive faith--not faith in a pope, not faith in a man, not faith in
   an old established creed, but faith in God! Oh, my Hearer, if you are
   willing to learn of Him, you shall not be left uninstructed!

   Now a lesson or two and I have done. The first lesson to be learned is
   this. If great men, if eminent men, if so-called learned men are not
   converted, do not be cast down about it--it is not likely they will be.
   In the next place, if many converts are obscure persons, persons
   without note or name, do not be at all disgusted with that fact. Who
   are you that you should be? Who are you that you should despise any
   upon whom God has looked in favor? Rather rejoice exceedingly with your
   Lord that God has chosen the despised and you with them!

   Next, learn that the Sovereignty of God is always exercised in such a
   way that the pure in heart may always rejoice in it. God never did a
   Sovereign act that the loving Christ, Himself, could not rejoice in. Be
   you content, therefore, to leave everything in the hands of God that
   you do not understand and when His way is in the sea, be quite as glad
   as when His way is in the sanctuary! When His footsteps are not known,
   feel that they are quite as righteous and quite as holy as when you can
   perceive the path in which He moves. The ultimate honor of the Gospel
   is secured unto God alone--let that be our last lesson.

   When the wind-up of all things shall come, there shall be no honor to
   any of us, nor would we desire it. But out of it all, out of the choice
   of each one and out of the Revelation made to each one, will come up,
   multiplied into a thousand thunders, the voice as of Christ in His
   whole mystical body, "I thank You, O Father." This shall be the song of
   Heaven concerning the whole matter--as well concerning the lost as the
   saved. "I thank You, O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth." There shall
   be no quibbling among the pure in heart, nor questions among the
   perfected spirits, but the whole family reviewing the whole of the
   Father's government--the hiding as well as the revealing, shall at the
   last say, Christ leading the utterance--"I thank You, O Father, Lord of
   Heaven and earth, that You have hid these things from the wise and
   prudent and have revealed them unto babes."

   Brothers and Sisters, let us learn our need of a personal revelation!
   Let us seek it if we have not yet received it! With a childlike spirit
   let us seek it in Christ, for only He can reveal the Father to us! And
   when we have it, let it be our joy that we see Him revealing it to
   others and let this be our prayer, that the God of Jacob would yet
   bring others unto Christ who shall rejoice in the Light of God that has
   made glad our eyes! The Lord be with you. Amen.

Untitled Sermon

   (No. 1572)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, DECEMBER 12, 1880,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The righteousness of Your testimonies is everlasting: give me
   understanding and I shall live." Psalm 119:144.

   YESTERDAY afternoon I was the subject of a somewhat singular
   circumstance. An esteemed friend and relative came over to my house,
   evidently laboring under great disturbance of mind and having enquiries
   to make of a very important order. I was, at the time, walking in the
   garden, so that I did not see him and he appeared to have great
   difficulty in mentioning the subject of his concern to my wife. At last
   it came out that he had seen a gentleman who had informed him that it
   was generally rumored that I had been taken ill with heart disease and
   had died in a very short time. My friend came to the point by cautious
   degrees and asked at length if I was seriously ill. "No," was the
   joyful reply of my beloved, "he is much the same as usual."

   Then it was clear I was not dead and the great fear was removed. The
   question was put, "Would you like to see him?" But my kind friend was
   perfectly satisfied and was too full of joy to wish to linger--he would
   go back and answer with certainty the many enquiries which continued to
   be made at the Tabernacle. How the report originated, I am quite at a
   loss to tell. It has evoked much kindness, but it is rather odd to feel
   called upon to assure your friends that you are yet alive! I can but
   show myself and ask my friends to see for themselves if I look like a
   dead man! When the peculiarity of the position had given place to other
   thoughts, it struck me in a solemn manner that the report might have
   been true and my death will assuredly be a fact one day unless our Lord
   should come speedily.

   Only sparing mercy from God's right hand has prevented it being true at
   this moment. We do not realize our mortality unless we are startled
   into a recognition of it. We believe others to be mortal and are not
   much surprised when they fall, but we have a secret notion that no axe
   will, for the present, be laid at our root. Yet reason would lead a man
   to ask, "It happens to many, to die suddenly, why should it not happen
   to me?" I regard the incident as a call to me to stand ready to depart
   at any time. Let it be a warning to you, also, to set your houses in
   order, for in a moment Death may surprise you!

   A practical lesson may be gathered from the very natural scene which
   followed my friend's departure. I came in from my walk and found myself
   suddenly seized by my wife with both hands--grasping the front of my
   coat she turned me round and looked at me steadily with a most tender
   gaze, declaring that she must take a double look at me and hold me
   before her eyes to be quite sure that her husband was yet alive to her
   unutterable joy. This special outpouring of thankfulness might have
   been lost had it not been for the rumor and, so far, it is well. May
   all of you be moved to the same feeling towards your dear ones whenever
   they come home at night alive! What would you do without them?

   What desolation would it cause in the house if a messenger hurriedly
   rushed into your house with the news of their sudden death? How we
   ought to love those who are spared to us and to praise God to think
   they are still alive. Suppose they were suddenly removed--have we
   valued them rightly? Try and act towards them as you would act if you
   knew that they would die today. If husband or wife had died, what a
   sorrow it would be if an unkind word had been spoken, or a difference
   had arisen just before the last look! What a painful cause for future
   regret! Let your affection to those about you gush forth freely as you
   reflect that God has spared them to you.

   Bless God, good woman, that you are a wife and not a widow! Bless God,
   Christian man, that you sit side by side with your dear spouse and have
   not to go weeping to her grave. What a blank! What a darkness! What a
   gloom would come over your household if either of the parents should be
   suddenly taken away! Therefore, praise God and be thankful and let us
   try to live towards one another and towards our Brothers and Sisters in
   Christ Jesus in such a way as we should wish to have done if they were
   suddenly to be taken. Pray for your pastor the more earnestly because
   you might, this

   morning, have missed him from your midst--and he will try and preach
   more earnestly to you because you may be gone before he will have
   another opportunity of addressing you.

   Let us continue knit together in love as long as we live, for the tie
   which now binds us together may soon be snapped. Out of a painful rumor
   may thus come a great blessing to families and congregations if it
   shall cause an increase of mutual love and an outpouring of united
   gratitude for sparing mercies! So much for a lesson as to this mortal
   life. By this incident I was further led to turn a heart-glance upon
   myself and to say, "I wonder whether there is any question as to
   whether I am alive in the higher sense?" That I am alive as to my
   natural life is clear enough--but is my spiritual life equally
   evidenced? This is a very necessary enquiry, for it is easy enough to
   make a fair show in the flesh and yet to be alienated from the life of
   God.

   Many abide in death, even as the Apostle says--"To be carnally-minded
   is death; but to be spiritually-minded is life and peace." The enquiry
   came home to my own heart and, therefore, I suggest it to yours, for it
   may profit you. Brothers and Sisters, do you live unto God? Are you
   walking as those who are alive from the dead? Remember, my Sisters,
   that it is written, "She that lives in pleasure is dead while she
   lives"--may no woman here come under that condemnation! Brothers, I
   call upon you, also, to remember the word of the Lord Jesus to the
   Church of Sardis, "I know your works, that you have a name that you
   live and are dead."

   Many exist upon the face of the earth, but into "life" they have never
   entered. They know not the Spirit and because they are strangers to His
   indwelling, they live after the flesh and mind the things of the flesh
   and of these it is written, "If you live after the flesh you shall
   die." Ask yourselves, then, these questions--have you been quickened
   from your death in trespasses and sins? Does the Divine Life beat
   within you in such a forceful and healthful manner that there can be no
   question about it? Is your life "hid with Christ in God" and are you
   numbered with the living in Zion? The living, the living! He shall
   praise you, O God, as we do this day!

   My subject is life--may the Lord of Life help me to speak of it after a
   lively manner! A consideration of the text will help in the enquiry as
   to whether we live unto God or not and it may further help those who
   sigh after the Divine Life to discover the way of Divine quickening.
   Let us again read the text, "The righteousness of Your testimonies is
   everlasting: give me understanding and I shall live." Here we have a
   touchingly humble prayer for life--"Give me understanding and I shall
   live."

   We will first consider this prayer in its simplicity. Secondly, I shall
   try to open it up more fully and, thirdly, we will go still deeper and
   search into the argument upon which the prayer is founded. There is a
   something about God's testimonies which will impart and sustain life,
   therefore the putting of the two sentences together--"The righteousness
   of Your testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding and I shall
   live."

   I. First, then, let us CONSIDER THIS PRAYER IN ITS SIMPLICITY. Without
   diving into its depths, let us see what lies upon its surface. This
   prayer is adapted for very general use. It would suit a child and be
   equally becoming from a venerable father. It might fall from the lips
   of those in whom there is but the faintest sign of Divine Grace and it
   might as fitly be used by those in whom Grace is ripening into Glory!
   We ask you to notice, first, that this is a suitable prayer for the
   awakened sinner. He discovers himself to be guilty and he perceives
   that there is a punishment for sin and so far he understands his
   position.

   Alarmed by his conscience, he thinks he sees the Judge upon the Great
   White Throne about to pronounce the final sentence and he knows what it
   must be, for it is written, "The soul that sins, it shall die." So far
   he understands well enough. He hears, also, that there is life, life in
   Christ Jesus, life for guilty men--but his mind is much confused with
   many terrors and with the horrible dread of the sure consequences of
   his sin. He has sufficient faith in the Revelation of God to know that
   there is life in a look at the Crucified One, but he does not quite
   understand what that look means. He knows that there is salvation in
   one name and in no other, but he does not quite comprehend what that
   faith is which obtains for a sinner the virtue of that saving name.

   Then is his time to pray, "Give me understanding and I shall live." He
   needs illumination for his darkened mind that he may see the way of
   salvation, that he may look to Christ and, by understanding the
   doctrine of His substitutionary Sacrifice, may be enabled, at once, to
   trust in Jesus and live! Christ is our life, but we need understanding,
   or we shall miss it. It is a blessed understanding which enables a man
   to feel that though the sentence of death may be in his members, yet he
   must and shall live if he believes in the Lord Jesus! What did the Lord
   Jesus say in His prayer for His people? "And

   this is life eternal, that they might know You, the only true God and
   Jesus Christ, whom You have sent." I pray you will, dear Hearers, if
   you feel your need of this life, let the prayer of the text go up
   quietly from your hearts--"Give me understanding and I shall live."

   Equally applicable, however, will this be in the case of one who is a
   Christian and who is struggling against temptation. Perhaps, my
   Brother, you are placed in a position where you are fiercely tempted
   from without by the world and possibly you may fear that you will not
   be able to survive it. It comes with such force that you are staggered
   by its power! You feel that you cannot bear up under such pressure! You
   despair of your spiritual life! Well, then, ask God to bring home His
   Word to your heart, that you may act wisely and may meet the rebuke of
   the ungodly and the temptations of the wicked--prudently baffling the
   adversary by your sacred vigilance. Pray, "Give me understanding and I
   shall live," for a clear understanding is necessary for your
   preservation from the enemy. May God make you wise as serpents and
   harmless as doves!

   Possibly the temptation comes from within you. There are passions
   within you which, at times, violently rebel and you are in anguish
   while you struggle to mortify them, though mortified they must be. Your
   soul abhors evil and wrestles against the lusts of the flesh, agonizing
   that you may walk before God in integrity, pleasing Him in all things.
   At times you are harshly beset and Satan, himself, draws near to aid
   the flesh with his fearful insinuations, or even by injecting
   blasphemous thoughts. Then is your hour of peril, for you are pressed
   out of measure while the enemy howls at you--"The Lord has forsaken
   you! Your God will be gracious no more!" Ah, then you need to know how
   to handle your weapons, the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of
   God, and that master weapon of All-Prayer!

   Perhaps you feel yourself so confused that you do not know what
   Scripture to plead in prayer, nor do you know what you should pray for
   as you ought. Well, then, remember the blessed word of Scripture, "If
   any man lacks wisdom, let him ask of God who gives to all men liberally
   and upbraids not." Let this be your prayer--"Give me understanding and
   I shall live, in spite of the assaults of the enemies." Though there
   are fights without and fears within, we shall overcome the world, the
   flesh and the devil and we shall live as Christian men, adorning the
   doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things if the Lord will give us a
   clear understanding of His Word and holy prudence and judgment by which
   we shall know how to behave ourselves wisely in a perfect way.

   Do you not think that this prayer will often well up from the heart of
   the suffering Believer? To some of our dear Brothers and Sisters, life
   is one long pang, for bodily disease has fixed its fangs in their
   flesh. There are others whose life is always from hand to mouth and
   sometimes bread is scant in the cupboard so that grinding poverty
   breaks them to dust. These are sore ills for those know who have to
   bear them. Some, too, are subject to domestic trials, watching daily
   the pining away of one they love, or bereavement has followed
   bereavement till they seem left alone in the land. Alas, the insatiate
   archer has taken a poisoned arrow from his quiver, yet again and again
   and love has had to weep over the terrible accuracy of his aim.

   Beloved Ones who have been called to suffer in these ways, have you not
   cried out at times, "I shall never be able to bear it! I shall die of a
   broken heart under these great afflictions! O that I might hide in the
   grave"? You fear that you will perish if the pressure continues, but
   you will do no such thing! God will help you to bear your burden by
   sustaining your soul with heavenly meat that others know nothing of. If
   the load is not made lighter, the shoulders shall be made stronger and
   this shall be done by your having a clearer understanding of the Word
   of God and a fuller experience of its supporting power! You do not so
   much need health, or wealth, or freedom from trouble, as more
   understanding of the Lord's mind and will in all the dispensations of
   His Providence. Breathe, then, the prayer to your heavenly Father--
   "Give me understanding and I shall live."

   Divine Grace can make us live like the three holy children in the fire,
   or like Jonah at the bottom of the sea, or like Daniel in a den of
   lions! It can make us patient in tribulation and joyful in
   distress--and Grace works by making us understand the Word of the Lord.
   Brethren, if we are taught of the Lord, we can live between the jaws of
   death and sing a song unto our Well-Beloved amid the wailings of famine
   and pestilence! By a God-given understanding, we shall know that all
   things work together for our good and so we shall "take pleasure in
   infirmities, in necessities and in distresses," for when we are weak,
   then are we strong!

   I thank God that a large number now present are not so much sufferers
   as workers. Now, I know that you who are working for God and trying to
   win souls often feel as if you were not half alive. I am compelled to
   make such a confession

   myself. I need to get alive to the utmost--not only having life, but
   having it "more abundantly." I have some life in me, thank God, but I
   need it to quicken me more completely! Sometimes we get into a sleepy
   state and then the Spirit chides us and we cry, "This will never do."--

   "Dear Lord! Shall we always live

   At this poor dying rate?

   Our love so faint, so cold to You,

   And You to us so great?"

   We need quickening, Brothers and Sisters! Do you not feel that it is
   so? I believe that those who are most earnest are the very persons who
   blame themselves the most for need of earnestness. When your whole soul
   is being consumed, you feel as if you need the coals of juniper to be
   blown up to a yet more vehement flame that you may go up like a cloud
   of incense unto God, dissolved in His service, consumed in His praise!
   Here, then, is our prayer, "Give me understanding and I shall live.
   Make me so to feel the power of Your Word that I may be ardent,
   fervent, full of life!" I will alter the poet's lines and say--

   "Lives of saintly men assure us We may make our lives sublime." We can
   live to noble purpose if, in answer to this prayer, God the Holy Spirit
   shall teach us to profit and give us understanding to know the will of
   the Lord and obey it faithfully.

   O you who would work successfully and acceptably, ask the great Lord of
   the Harvest to enlighten your hearts and minds that you may not labor
   as in the dark, but as wise men made expert by the Holy Spirit. Is not
   this a very proper and blessed prayer for aspiring minds in the Church
   of God, of whom I trust there are many present? Such men are not
   satisfied with themselves, but press forward to that which is yet
   beyond and above them. They have not reached that imaginary climax
   which some prattle of who dote upon their fancied perfectness--but
   their motto is, "Onward! Upward! Heavenward!" These dwell on high, but
   their cry is, "Higher! Higher!"

   They walk with God and therefore say--

   "Oh for a closer walk with God." They are calm and happy, but yet they
   sigh for a still serener frame. They have power in prayer, but they
   long for more of a wrestling spirit and for greater prevalence with
   God. If there are any here who are fired with such Divine ambitions,
   what better prayer can they use than this--"Give me understanding and I
   shall live"? For if God teaches us rightly to use the Divine Word so as
   to mark, learn and inwardly digest it by the understanding, then shall
   we be nourished into complete manhood and shall go from strength to
   strength! The new man is renewed in knowledge and nourished by the
   Truth of God and, "we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the
   glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory,
   even as by the Spirit of the Lord."

   Our prayer must be that the Lord would make us understand what He would
   have us do and how to do it. Then shall we live when we are made of
   "quick understanding in the fear of the Lord" and ready in heart to
   perfect all His will. This will be an angelic life, for those holy
   beings do His commandments, hearkening unto the voice of His Word. It
   will be a seraphic life, for as we burn with holy fervor we shall
   resemble those ministers whom God makes to be a flaming fire! It will
   be a heavenly life, for we shall strive to do the Lord's will on earth
   as it is done in Heaven. Do you long for this? The way to it is not to
   be found in dreams and visions and fanatical excitements and delirious
   conceits, but in a calm, quiet, solid and deep understanding of the
   revealed Word of God! Our Lord prayed--"Sanctify them through Your
   truth, Your Word is truth." No other means are needed for the fullest
   development of holiness--you only require the Word to be unveiled by
   the Spirit to your mind and understanding and in the utmost sense of
   the term you shall "live."

   Last of all, when we shall not be so much aspiring saints as expiring
   saints--when we come to lie upon our last bed and to look into the
   unseen--then may we still pray after the same fashion! When the eyes
   shall begin to open to the light of Heaven and things but darkly seen,
   before, grow clearer in the dawn of the eternal day--when the songs of
   angels begin to break upon the opening ears of the soul and Heaven is
   drawing near, for Grace is ripening into Glory and Glory is coming to
   welcome its heir--then may we pray to live through the understanding
   and experience of the Divine Word! How blessed it will be to have such
   an understanding of Divine realities that we shall stay ourselves upon
   the promises, shall rejoice in the Everlasting Covenant and derive
   strong consolation from the oath of God.

   How blessed, then, to understand our living union with our risen Lord
   and to know the experience of the happy Psalmist when He sang--"Yes,
   though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
   evil; for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff they comfort me."
   With God's Spirit within us lighting up the soul by the understanding
   of the fact that Jesus is the Resurrection and the Life, we shall live
   in the midst of death and find our Savior's Words to be true--"He that
   lives and believes in Me shall never die." We shall ford that shallow
   stream of death, which, while it chills our feet, shall not be able to
   chill our hearts! It may stop our pulse, but it shall not silence our
   song which shall rise higher and higher as speech shall fail. We shall
   but shut our eyes on earth and open them in Heaven, for God, who has
   given us understanding here below shall, surely, give us to dwell above
   where they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the
   firmament!

   And thus, I think, I have shown you that this prayer sounds well on
   every note of the scale. You may sound it out of the depths of seeking
   penitence and you may run up to the very highest note with the
   expectancy of Glory and the words will sound well on any note you
   touch. From the wicket gate of humble faith up to the gate of pearl
   which admits into the golden city, you may go on praying, "Give me
   understanding and I shall live."

   II. The time has come when under our second division THE PRAYER IS TO
   BE MORE FULLY OPENED UP. "Give me understanding and I shall live." Here
   is a need confessed because it is deeply felt--the suppliant
   acknowledges his need of understanding. Has that need been felt by you,
   my Brothers and Sisters? It certainly exists, "For vain man would be
   wise, though man is born like a wild ass's colt." The wittiest, wisest,
   best instructed man who has only human learning, if he knows not God,
   has reached no further than that acme of all carnal wisdom spelled in
   four letters, "FOOL." We are all fools till God gives us understanding!
   A sense of our own folly is the first step of all wisdom. To cry out
   after understanding proves that we have already received some
   understanding for, mark you, this text of mine is the prayer of a man
   of God!

   I suppose the 119th is David's Psalm--at any rate it is the Psalm of a
   very gracious Spirit-taught man and you see he still cries, even though
   he has understanding in a measure, "Give me understanding." He that is
   taught of God is the man that asks to be taught of God and she who has
   chosen the good part is the woman who sits at Jesus' feet to hear His
   Words. It is the mark of a wise man that he does not think himself so
   and that he continues to pray, "Give me understanding." It is true of
   us all, that apart from the gifts of God, by His Spirit, we are without
   understanding and as naturally go astray as silly sheep. Note this fact
   and be well persuaded of it, that you may pray with the greater
   earnestness.

   Next, the prayer is evidently put upon the footing of free Grace. He
   prays, "Give me understanding"--it must be a gift from God. The prayer
   is directed to God, for God, alone, can give understanding. Teachers
   can enlighten an understanding which already exists, but they cannot
   give one. Masters and instructors can profit nothing till we have an
   understanding with which to receive knowledge aright. Any man who is
   taught in the Word can teach us the letter of Scripture, but no man can
   give us an inner understanding of its spirit--that must be a revelation
   and it must be worked in us by Him that made the light and the sun, or
   we shall never come to an understanding of the Word of God!

   Let it always be known that all Light of God is from the Lord Jesus,
   Himself--"In Him was life and the life was the light of men." "That was
   the true Light which lights every man that comes into the world." All
   real understanding of the Word of God must come to us as it did to the
   disciples on the road to Emmaus, of whom it is written, "Then opened He
   their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures." The
   Author of the sacred Volume must, Himself, expound it to the heart and
   understanding or we shall be blinded by its light rather than made to
   see. David prayed, "Open You my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things
   out of Your Law" and we must pray the same.

   When the Lord graciously hears our supplications, we must take care to
   give Him all the praise and glory of the work, for it will be a deed of
   Grace and Grace alone. If He left us in darkness we could not complain,
   for we have refused the Light and if He opens our eyes, we must glorify
   His mercy and cry, "Blessed be the Lord who has shown us light."
   Brothers and Sisters, the Psalmist speaks of understanding in a general
   way--"Give me understanding"--as if he wanted the faculty for use in
   many directions. In every transaction of this life we need to be
   prudent, for we are surrounded by a thousand snares and pitfalls and if
   we do not exercise discretion we shall be taken all unawares and become
   the prey of our enemies. We bear within our own natures so much to
   confuse and confound and entangle that if we are not taught prudence
   and understanding we shall certainly never escape from the mischief
   that is within us.

   We are frequently like men in a fog who cannot tell where they are. It
   happened but the other day near Milan that so dense a fog covered the
   railway that a number of workmen who were employed upon the line heard
   the sound of an approaching luggage train and rushed to get away from
   it--but at that same moment an express train, which they had not heard
   or seen, came rushing upon them and cut them to pieces. Such is our
   condition at times--we try to get away from one temptation and we fall
   into another--we hope to escape one form of evil and we rush into
   another! Haste breeds heedlessness and warmth of zeal is apt to beget
   indiscretion so that we daily need a good share of understanding as a
   ballast to our sail.

   A Christian man should be a sensible man, a man with all his wits about
   him. He needs to possess the wisdom of the Book of Proverbs as well as
   the devotion of the Psalms and the rapture of Solomon's Song. Those
   books are placed together in the Bible as if to show that they ought to
   be read together and that their spirit and influence are essential to a
   complete practical character. I would have you bow your ears to the
   voice of your Well-Beloved, but you must also be ready to deal with the
   voices of everyday life. It is one of the objects of true religion to
   give subtlety to the simple and to the young man, knowledge and
   discretion. We must not be ignorant of the devices of the devil, nor
   childish in yielding credence to the falsehoods of men.

   We need, in all the walks of life, to exercise understanding and, thank
   God, we may learn to do so, for the Scriptures say, "The Lord gives
   wisdom: out of His mouth comes knowledge and understanding. He lays up
   sound wisdom for the righteous: He is a buckler to them that walk
   uprightly. He keeps the paths of judgment and preserves the way of His
   saints." Still, while the understanding sought for in the prayer is
   evidently of a general character, the former portion of the verse links
   it with a special understanding of the Word of God and, oh, Beloved, we
   need, above all things, to understand what God has revealed! Take care,
   first, that you know it. Search the Scriptures--let them be the man of
   your right hand. Prevent the night watches while you search them.
   Prevent the dawn of the day by meditating upon them. Be you scribes
   well-instructed in the Law of the Lord.

   Next, believe the Divine Revelation. Be it your prayer that you may so
   understand the Lord's statutes as fully to accept them by faith.
   Believe the teachings of the Word as realities, not locking them up in
   the dark dungeon of a forgotten creed, but making them bright realities
   in the life and liberty of your Christian action and full of influence
   upon every movement of your mind. Knowing and believing, it will be
   time to advance to meditation. Consider the Words of God-- weigh them,
   test them, dive into them. The richest ore lies deepest. There may be
   sands of gold sparkling upon the surface of the Bible, but the great
   nuggets are reserved for those who dig deep both by day and by night!
   Consider well the words of Eternal Life and then go on to obey their
   teaching.

   You will never have an understanding of the Word unless you practice
   it. He who does the will of God shall know of the doctrine. We know
   nothing aright till our hearts come into complete subjection to the
   Spirit. Oh for such an understanding as this, that the inner life may
   be nourished to fullness of stature by feeding on the Bread from
   Heaven! To this must be added experience, for who understands the Word
   of God till he has experienced its truth and power? What a blessed
   knowledge of a promise you receive when it is fulfilled to you! How you
   understand the reality of prayer when you have received an answer! How
   you know the meaning of communion with Christ when your face shines
   with having seen Him! How you understand the secret consolations of the
   Holy Spirit when, in deep water, you have felt their won-drously
   lifting power!

   This prayer means so much that in one sermon I cannot open it all up to
   you. Nor, indeed, could I do so were a lifetime at my disposal! O Lord,
   give us understanding to know, to believe, to consider, to practice and
   to experience Your Word! Let each man cry, "O God, give me this and
   then I shall truly live!" I think you will begin to see what a
   connection there is between all this and the testimonies of the Lord,
   for the righteousness of the Divine Word is to be transcribed into the
   letter of our daily life if we are to live to the fullest. Permit me,
   now, to say that no man who is at all awakened can really live unless
   he knows the Word of God and understands its inner meaning. For this
   reason--Do you call it life to live without the Light of God?

   You may have been in the sepulchral dungeons of Venice where not a ray
   of light ever came to the unhappy prisoners. To linger there, do you
   call that life? To live without the Light of God is just such an
   existence! We have heard of men who have been immured in dungeons for
   40 years, constantly wearing manacles, never breathing fresh air--do
   you call that life? Can there be "life" where there is no liberty?
   Alas, some men have never been free, but have remained captives

   to their lusts, never knowing the liberty with which Christ makes men
   free. Do you call such bondage, life? Another essential of life is
   love. To have nobody to love and nobody to love you--is that life? Yet
   many a soul feels that it cannot be content with earthly love and yet
   if it has not the love of God, the love of Christ, the love of the
   Spirit, it is loveless! Do you call that life?

   Infinite love is a necessity of an immortal spirit. Without light,
   without liberty, without love there is no life. But more, many men
   exist without peace--driven to and fro like a sere leaf by the tempest.
   Never resting, they are as a rolling thing before the whirlwind. Do you
   call that life? "There is no peace, says my God, to the wicked." Is
   that life? And then to have no grand objective, no objective worthy of
   yourself--to be living in this world merely to get enough bread and
   cheese to eat, just keeping yourself breathing and your family
   breathing--is that life? No heavenly objective? No ambition worthy of
   an immortal spirit? Do you call that life?

   Death before you, which you dare not think of! No hope, unless it is
   the ghastly figment of annihilation! Dreadful hope! To me a thought
   most horrible! To live without hope is not life--far rather call it
   death. Lord, give me understanding of Your everlasting
   testimonies--then I shall live, but I shall never live till You grant
   me this gift!

   III. Now we will take the third step and go deeper, LAYING BARE THE
   ARGUMENT OF THIS PRAYER. What does he mean by saying, "The
   righteousness of Your testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding
   and I shall live"? I think he means this--that the Word of God, when it
   is practically and experimentally understood by the mind, is a pledge
   of life. Do you think that God would take one of us to be His child and
   teach us His Word and then, after all, permit us to be condemned to
   die? Is that His fashion? Did you ever hear of a judge who instructed a
   criminal in the arts and sciences laboriously for years with the view
   of executing him when the task was done? Nothing of the sort!

   If the Lord has taught you, it is because the Lord has bought you and
   He will not lose the purchase of His blood! If the Lord has taught you,
   it is because He means to take you where your education will be
   completed--to take you Home to dwell with Him above! "Give me
   understanding and I shall live"--I am quite clear about that. If You,
   great God, have made me understand the evil of sin, the preciousness of
   the blood of Christ, the power of Your Spirit, the indwelling of the
   Holy Spirit--if You have made me experimentally to understand this, I
   know I shall live, for You will not make me ashamed of my hope--

   "Can He have taught me to trust in His name, And have brought me thus
   far to put me to shame?"

   The next argument is this--an understanding of the Word of God is life
   because we are told that the Word of God is the "living and
   incorruptible Seed which lives and abides forever." Very well, then, if
   that Seed is sown in my heart, my heart must live forever. There can be
   no death where the Seed is incorruptible! If the Word of the Lord is
   living within us, then there is within us a life eternal! Be you sure
   of this, then--if you have enjoyed a vital experience of God's Word,
   you have within you a well of water springing up into everlasting life!

   Furthermore, the Word of God is not only the Seed of life, but it is
   the food of life. "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word
   that proceeds out of the mouth of God shall man live." And if you live
   on the Word that comes out of God's mouth, you cannot die. How can you?
   For in the Word of God you read of the "flesh," which is, "meat
   indeed," and that "blood" which is, "drink indeed." And the Incarnate
   Word, Himself, has said, "He that eats Me, the same shall live by Me.
   Because I live, you shall live, also." There is forcible argument here!

   Once more, the understanding of God's Word is the very flower and crown
   and glory of true life. When a man so understands God's Word as to
   experience it and to practice it, he has reached a high point of
   spiritual culture and his life will be loaded, like Aaron's rod, with
   buds and blossoms and fruit unto God's glory! He will be such a man
   that he shall only need to take one step and be in Heaven! He is a
   shock of corn fully ripe, each single stalk bowing its head towards the
   earth as if it asked to be gathered in. Let us pray God will give us an
   understanding of His blessed Word, for then we shall be ripe for Glory
   and in the highest sense it will be true that we shall "live."

   I have scarcely a minute to spare, but I must venture to detain you
   while we observe that the Psalmist alludes to one point in reference to
   God's Word which is, to us, the very marrow and fatness of the whole.
   God's Word is said to be righteous--"The righteousness of Your
   testimonies is everlasting." Now, upon this righteousness the life of
   every Christian hangs. "God is not unrighteous to forget your work of
   faith and labor of love." "If we confess our sins, He is faithful

   and just to forgive us our sins." A righteous God cannot destroy a man
   in whom His Grace has worked an understanding of His Word, for that
   were to deal unrighteously with him, since he is justified by the
   knowledge of Christ.

   The godly serve a just God and a Savior and, therefore, they have
   nothing to fear. This righteousness of God's Word is so certain that it
   is said to be everlasting. Brothers and Sisters, my life hangs on the
   everlastingness of all God's Word! If it can change, then I must
   die--but if it cannot change, then I shall live. The righteousness of
   God, according to the text, is everlasting since none can challenge it.
   No caviler will ever prove God's way of salvation, or of Providence, to
   be unrighteous. If that could be done, then the Believer might die. But
   since that righteousness cannot be disproved, he shall live. "Who shall
   lay anything to the charge of God's elect?" The Divine righteousness
   stands fast forever and ever, settled in Heaven, ordained to answer all
   demands throughout all ages. Let us so understand it as to take it to
   be ours and we shall live!

   I cannot understand the notion of certain professing Christians that a
   change comes over Christianity as the ages move on--that there is a
   Christianity for the first century and a revised Christianity for the
   present era! We have become very enlightened of late! You are aware
   that this is the marvelous 19th Century! We have invented the electric
   light and none can deny that we are the most enlightened people that
   ever lived on the face of the earth! It is not, of course, pride on our
   part to say so, for we are very modest. Among us there are men who are
   wonderfully brilliant--Paul was but a farthing candle compared with
   them. They understand, by culture and thought, so much that it is an
   honor to speak with them!

   The Gospel that was preached to the poor, which childlike persons
   understood by the enlightening influence of the Holy Spirit, is, in
   their eyes a very poor business. They sneer and turn up their cultured
   noses at what they call, "the simple Gospel," as if a simple Gospel
   were meant for simpletons. Well, now, to my mind this is the very bliss
   and blessedness of the Gospel--that the righteousness of God's
   testimonies is everlasting--that though it has been tried by criticism
   and tested by experience, it remains the same in its spotless purity
   and in its Divine Infallibility to this day! If God should be pleased
   to lengthen out the life of any of you till you are as old as
   Methuselah, you will not have to say, "I must die now, for the Gospel
   is worn out. I must perish now, for the righteousness of the Word of
   God has been disproved."

   Thus says Jehovah, "I am the Lord, I change not, therefore you sons of
   Jacob are not consumed." We may catch the echo of His proclamation and
   say, "Because the Word which reveals our God never changes, therefore
   we shall live." Do you need a better Gospel, any of you? Go and fish
   for it, if you do, but not in the waters of the Truth of God! Do you
   need any nobler promise, any surer covenant? Wander through the deserts
   of salt till your skeleton lies bleaching there, for that will be your
   only reward if you turn away from the feast of fat things, of wines on
   the lees well-refined. As for me, I bless God that the righteousness of
   His testimonies is everlasting and by them I mean to abide all my days,
   God helping me.

Bad Lodgers and How To Treat Them

   (No. 1573)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "O Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness that you may be saved.
   How long shall your vain thoughts lodge within you?" Jeremiah 4:14.

   ONE notices, in reading such a chapter as this fourth of Jeremiah, that
   the change which God required in the Jewish people was a very deep and
   thorough one. It was not only the washing of their hands, nor the
   cleansing of their outward lives, but the washing of their hearts from
   wickedness--and the Lord did not only require of them that they should
   cease from wicked actions, but even from vain thoughts. The like demand
   He makes of us, for He says by the mouth of His servant James, "Cleanse
   your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double minded."
   This makes our holy religion a weighty and solemn business!

   If it were wholly a matter of outward ordinances, we might take the
   child and sprinkle it, or might bring the adult and plunge him. Or we
   might admit all to a table where they should eat and drink such
   consecrated materials as should save them. This would all be easy
   enough and, therefore, men cling to a religion of ceremonies, for heart
   religion is troublesome and the ungodly cannot endure it! Ritualism is
   the most popular religion in the world because it is all, "Ho! Presto!"
   Done in a minute--nothing to think of, nothing to care about, nothing
   to sorrow over! It is all a mere matter of form which men leave to
   their priests--as they leave their deeds to be drawn up by their
   lawyers and their medicine to be prescribed by their doctors! The
   little that is needed of them can be done without thought and they can
   go on in their sins as pleasantly as ever.

   Next to that in popularity is the religion of mere morality. "Yes, we
   know we do amiss. We will amend. Gross vices shall be lopped off as
   stray branches that run over a wall. We will at once purge ourselves
   from everything for which our fellow men would blame us. Is not that
   enough?" Many hope it is and live as if they felt sure it was! But the
   religion of the Word of God is not so. It is, "Rend your hearts and not
   your garments"--therefore ceremonies are not enough! "You shall love
   the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with
   all your mind and with all your strength"--therefore outward actions
   are not enough! This is too hard a demand and as for repentance and
   faith, the ungodly cannot enter upon such spiritual duties for they
   have no mind to them.

   The carnal mind hates the mention of spiritual things. This, I take it,
   while it makes the Christian religion so solemn, throws us back upon
   one of its great first principles--that salvation must be of Grace
   because if it is necessary that my heart must be changed, can I change
   it? I am bid to do so! I am told in such a text as this to wash my
   heart from wickedness! But how can I do it? Shall a fountain purge
   itself? It has sent forth bitter waters, bitter as Marah--can it, of
   itself, do the reverse? "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the
   leopard his spots?" That would be a very simple business, for skin and
   spots are outside things--but how shall a man change his heart--his
   very nature?

   Do you expect the crab tree to change itself into a sweet apple-bearing
   tree? Will you go and talk--to come back to the former metaphor--to the
   waters of Marah and expect them to change themselves into the sweet
   wells of Elim? No, this requires the finger of God! If ever this is
   done, God must do it. It is a rule that Nature can only rise as high as
   Nature. Put water where you please, it will rise up to where it started
   from and, unless under pressure, it will rise no higher. And you shall
   not find man rising above his fallen and depraved nature. "The carnal
   mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the Law of God,
   neither, indeed, can it be."

   Out of the grave there comes not life. Out of an unclean thing there
   comes not a clean thing. We must be born from above if we are ever born
   aright. We must be newly created by the Creator, Himself, and become
   new creatures in Christ Jesus or else we can never come up to the mark
   which God's Law requires. "Wash your heart." Oh, God, how can I wash my
   heart? Though I take to myself snow water and make myself seem
   outwardly ever so clean, yet what have I done with my heart? You bid me
   drive out my thoughts, but, O my God, my thoughts often come against my
   will and sometimes

   with my will and I am tossed about by them as a poor sea shell by the
   restless waves of the sea! They compass me about like bees! Yes, they
   compass me about, these vain thoughts of mine, like bees which sting my
   good desires to death.

   Like flies of summer, they buzz about my ears and fill my mind with
   corruption and they will not be driven away. I can no more resist them
   than Jannes and Jambres could withstand the Egyptian plague! Oh, how
   can I purge out vain thoughts? Where shall I turn for strength to
   perform this necessary duty? "By Grace are you saved, through faith;
   and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God." And what you cannot
   do, in that you are weak through the flesh, God can do for you and His
   Divine Spirit will sweetly enable you to perform all duties which He
   requires of you! If you are willing and obedient and yield yourselves
   up to the blessed Gospel of the Grace of God, He will make you
   clean--and your thoughts, too, shall be purged as with fire till they
   shall rise like a sweet incense unto Him! Let this word at the outset
   encourage any person who may be inclined to say before I have done, "It
   is a hard saying: who can bear it?"

   Now to our text, "How long shall your vain thoughts lodge within you?"
   Bad lodgers! Some people have admitted bad lodgers into their chambers.
   I have known a good many people troubled with them and there is no use
   in keeping them--they must be sent adrift. So the text says, "How long
   shall vain thoughts lodge within you?" It means that we must not be
   slow to give them notice to leave, for they ought not to be tolerated
   in the human breast. First, let me name some of these lodgers.
   Secondly, let me show what bad lodgers they are. And, thirdly, let me
   give you some advice as to how to get rid of them.

   May the Holy Spirit come and bless this word to their immediate
   ejectment and may a stronger than they come and dwell forever in you,
   not as a lodger, but as Lord and Owner of your whole being!

   I. First, then, HERE ARE CERTAIN BAD LODGERS and I should not wonder if
   some people here have found and furnished chambers in their hearts and
   heads for these mischievous tenants whose name is "vain thoughts." Many
   thoughts may be called vain because they are proud, conceited thoughts.
   Thus, whenever a man thinks himself good by nature, we may say of his
   thoughts, "Vanity of vanities: all is vanity!" If you are unrenewed and
   dream that you are better than others because your parents were godly,
   it is a vain thought!

   If you have never been born again by the Spirit of God and are trusting
   in your infant baptism, it is a vain thought! If you have never come to
   believe in Jesus but think yourself very good because you are a
   respectable person and regularly attend a place of worship, it is a
   vain thought! If you have got it in your head that when we talk about
   sinners we do not mean you and that when God's Word condemns men for
   their sins it leaves a loophole of escape for you, it is a vain
   thought! If you have an idea that you do not need to come to Christ as
   a poor, helpless sinner--that you do not need the same kind of change
   as others--that, indeed, there is a private way to Heaven for you and
   you have found the silver key for it, you have made a mistake! It is a
   vain thought!

   You will have to be born again or else if you are not born twice you
   will die twice! You will have to be washed in the blood of Jesus Christ
   or you will die in your sins! You will have to come crying to Him for
   mercy and to find everything in Him or you will remain under
   condemnation and perish in your iniquity! If you think it is not so, it
   is a vain thought! Every thought of self-righteousness is a vain
   thought! Every idea, moreover, of self-power--that you can do this and
   do that towards your own salvation and at any time, when it pleases
   you, you can turn and become a Christian and so there is no need to be
   in a hurry, or to seek the help of the Holy Spirit--that, also, is a
   vain thought! To reckon yourself to be anything more than a mass of sin
   and helplessness is a vain thought! You have misconceived your own true
   value and your condition before God.

   Now, perhaps I speak to some here who really are a very nice sort of
   people. At least they feel they are, for they go to a place of worship
   where they are not often spoken to very personally. And if the minister
   does speak pointedly, they say, "I do not think he has any right to
   talk in that way. People should be charitable." Is it supposed to be
   charitable to allow people to go down to Hell without warning them? My
   charity leads me to try, as best as I can, to break up all shams and I
   am sure that self-righteousness is a sham, a deadly delusion, a
   destructive error! It is ruining tens of thousands of people--good,
   quiet, harmless, inoffensive people--people, too, that are generous in
   their business and kind and all that and who, therefore, conclude that
   they are safe for time and eternity.

   They say, "Well, now, I don't know that I have done anything so very
   wrong. I do not see that I need repentance and faith, or that I need
   come as that poor thief did on the Cross and just look to Christ and
   say, 'Lord, remember me.'" Dear Friend, I must address you in the
   language of the text, "How long shall your vain thoughts lodge within
   you?" For they

   are all vain, every one of them! "By the works of the Law shall no
   flesh be justified" in the sight of God. The way to Heaven is not by
   our fancied works of righteousness--salvation is by Grace through faith
   in Jesus Christ! Another sort of vain thoughts may be ranged under the
   head of carnal security. The poet says, "All men think all men mortal
   but themselves" and, as often as the saying is quoted, never was a
   proverb more generally true.

   We are surprised to hear that So-and-So, who was well and hearty three
   days ago, is dead. We are quite taken aback for the moment but we never
   dream that it will happen to us! We are alarmed when we hear that a
   person who was sitting near to us in the pew on Sunday is now in his
   coffin, but we indulge the hope that we shall see old age! A person,
   the other day, who was consumptive died suddenly of hemorrhage of the
   lungs and yet another consumptive person says, "This sad thing does
   happen to invalids whose lungs are diseased, but I do not suppose it
   will ever befall me." Men go out to their daily business and they say,
   "Many that wake this morning will never see the sun go down," but they,
   themselves, talk of what they will do in the evening as if they were
   sure of surviving! There is no hint of, "If the Lord wills, we shall do
   this

   or that."

   We know, all of us, that life is very uncertain, yet multitudes are
   hazarding their souls upon the uncertainty of that life under an inward
   belief which they would not dare to express--that somehow or other they
   are sure not to die just yet. What is such security but a vain thought?
   Does it not strike you, dear Friends, when a man is 80, 88, 90, that
   surely he cannot expect to get through another year? As a reasonable
   man, he must reckon that he is soon to die. Not at all! He is often the
   man who thinks least about death and if you introduce the topic, he
   does not like the conversation and starts you on another tack. Many who
   are younger than they do not like you to mention anything about
   advanced age or growing old. You must talk of these old sheep as if
   they were still lambs or they will not like it--speak plain truth about
   their years and they are offended.

   If you want an old man to move quickly out of the road when you are
   driving, always cry, "Move on, my lad," and he feels complimented and
   moves immediately because there is in him a joy in being thought young
   and an aversion to the idea of his being old. This is ridiculous! You
   smile and you may well smile, for it is a folly, but yet how common a
   folly. Why, when a man is of ripe age, or a woman, why should they not
   know it and let it be known? Why should they not number their days and
   keep the reckoning before their own minds? If all things are right with
   you and me, the older we are, the better!

   Someone said to a Christian man, "What is your age?" and he replied, "I
   am on the right side of seventy." They found out that he was 75 and
   they said, "You told us you were on the right side of seventy." "So I
   am," he answered, "that is the right side, for it is the side which is
   nearest Heaven, my blessed Home." Why should not all Christians think
   so? They do think so when they judge rightly, for they joyfully sing--

   "Here in the body tent,

   Absent from Him I roam,

   Yet nightly pitch my moving tent

   A day's march nearer Home."

   If a day's march is worth singing about, is not a year's journey nearer
   Home a theme for still greater delight? Should we try to make out that
   we have so much longer to stay in exile--so much longer before we shall
   see the face of the Well-Beloved--so much longer before, like heirs
   that have come of age, we shall enter on our Divine inheritance?

   My Hearers, drive out these vain thoughts about not dying! I will lead
   the way for you. I am as likely to die tonight as any other man upon
   the face of this earth. You, too, my Friend, may as likely never see
   another Sunday as anyone else. You tell me you do not know that you
   have any special disease and, indeed, I hope you have not--but we all
   carry something about us in which Death can fix his arrow. Depend upon
   it that the seeds of mortality are in every constitution. I have met
   with one man--no, with two men--who do not believe that they shall die.
   But as they are getting very much older and one of them stoops very
   much, I am under the impression that they will die--and I pray anybody
   here who thinks that such an idea is a folly, to remember that it is a
   minor form of the same folly to say--"I shall not die just yet."

   You may as well say, "I shall not die at all," for it leads to the same
   practical conclusion--death at a distance influences us very little
   more than no death at all! You may die at any moment! And what, my dear
   Hearer, if at this moment, while seated in that pew, your naked spirit
   were suddenly to find itself at the bar of God? What would become of
   you? I charge you, by the living God and by your care about your own
   soul, do not let that thought escape your mind! It is a vain thought
   for me to suppose that I shall have 10 minutes longer to live! It is a
   vain thought to grant myself a lease for

   another week, for I am a tenant-at-will and I may be ejected in a
   moment! So let me get rid of the folly and vanity of carnal security.

   At this moment the Holy Spirit says to any of you who may be presuming
   upon long life--"How long shall your vain thoughts lodge within you?" I
   know another set of thoughts--they are better looking, but they are
   equally vain-- for they promise much and come to nothing. They are vain
   because they are fruitless. These vain thoughts are like the better
   order of people in Jerusalem--good people after a sort--that is to say
   they really thought that as God threatened them with judgments they
   would turn to Him. Certainly they would! They had no intention of being
   hard-hearted! Far from it! They acknowledged the power of the Prophet's
   appeal. They felt a degree of awe in the Presence of the just God as He
   threatened them and, of course, they meant--they meant to wash their
   hearts and they meant to put away all their forbidden practices--but
   not just yet!

   They would not wait very long, of course. A long delay would be very
   dangerous, but they might safely tarry a little longer. They had an
   engagement which would take them into worldly company and so they must
   wait till that was over. They had formed close connections which they
   could not very well break and so religion must be regretfully postponed
   for a more convenient season. They were engrossed in a certain business
   which they could not easily get out of for a term of years--but they
   would! Oh, they would! Certainly! Certainly they would attend to God
   and their souls! Though they did not say so in words, yet their faces
   appealed to the preacher pleadingly--"Do not press us too much just
   now. We are honest people. We acknowledge the bill. Let it run a little
   longer. We do not mean to break away from the demands of God by any
   means. We quite intend to comply with them at a near date, but not
   today. Oh, no, we do not deny the Scriptures! Do not think that we are
   infidels! We do not doubt the love of Christ to men or the power of His
   Gospel--we hope to feel it in a little while."

   They mean to enjoy the love of God one of these days and they hope to
   wind up their lives in a saintly manner. They feel rather pleased with
   themselves because they are so good as to resolve--if it is not virtue,
   itself, which they possess-- yet the resolve to possess it flatters
   them into great notions of themselves! It is a great deal to be able to
   get so far as good resolutions, so they think. Well, now, my Friend,
   has not that been the style ofyour thoughts for a great many years? Did
   you not think like that when you were a child--when you were yet fresh
   to the ways of religion and had not yet learned so much of other ways
   as you have now? Do you not remember those early impressions--those
   tears at night, those childlike cries to Jesus, your mother's Savior?
   Yes, you do remember them and there were times not so very long ago
   when all came back to you and you sat in the House of God trembling and
   wishing you could get to your chamber and bow your knees in prayer!

   You were on the borders of Immanuel's land and there was only a step
   between you and Life. You wished that the step was taken, but
   still--well, there was a reason why it should not be taken just
   yet--and so you dared to bid the Lord to wait your leisure as if He
   were a beggar at your door to whom you were under no obligation. Alas
   for this constant delaying! Where will it land you? I see upon your
   head the signs of age, but you are not yet born of God. Your eyes are
   failing. You need spectacles, but you have not yet looked to Jesus!
   Years have followed years and the record of your sin is a long roll
   written on both sides and you are still resolving and still making up
   your mind to something very good--still hoping that the right time is
   coming, only you must wait a little longer.

   Now, the Lord says, "How long shall your vain thoughts lodge within
   you?" for they are all vain, these delays, these false promises, these
   self-deceptions. How long shall it be that they shall throng the
   avenues of your soul and curse your spirit? In some, who I hope are
   saved, their vain thoughts lie in a similar direction--they trust that
   they have believed, but they are slow to obey their Lord in publicly
   avowing their discipleship. They know that the Gospel has two
   pre-cepts--"He that believes and is baptized shall be saved," or, in
   other words, "He that with his heart believes and with his mouth makes
   confession of Him, shall be saved."

   They resolve that they will, one of these days, make a confession of
   their faith--such is their fixed intention--but the time is not yet
   come, for at present they are filled with questions as to their
   condition. They once felt sure that they had faith. Had they confessed
   it, then, that certainty might have continued. They have so long kept
   their obedience to their Lord in abeyance that they begin, now, to
   question and, perhaps rightly, whether they have really believed. The
   Lord Jesus has said, "He that confesses Me before men, him will I
   confess before My Father which is in Heaven." But,

   then, somebody would laugh at them--they would have a cross to carry
   and this hinders them and so they postpone obedience to an indefinite
   period.

   Jesus Christ says, "He that takes not up his cross and follows not
   after Me is not worthy of Me." But they mean, if they can, to find a
   by-path, so as not to go along the king's highway and pay toll at the
   gates, or be met by the king's officers, or be seen by the king's
   enemies. They will, if they can, creep under a hedge when the battle
   begins and so escape the perils of the fight. Their religion gives them
   the courage of a rat behind the wainscot and no more. They do not come
   out except at night when nobody sees them. But this cowardice is not
   intended to last forever--they are going to be very brave one of these
   days--you shall see them performing great exploits! They intend, before
   very long, to openly say, "I am on the Lord's side."

   They will come forward and display their colors. They will be the
   bravest of the brave--only not just yet. Another time for seeing the
   Church officers with reference to union with the Church will pass away
   and another and another and yet they will be no nearer the point of
   decision. Their resolutions are vain thoughts and so I put the
   question, "How long?" Do fix some time or other! Do not forever remain
   a trifler with God and His Church and His command! "How long shall your
   vain thoughts"--your ineffectual promises of obedience to
   Christ--"lodge within you?"

   Now I shall come closely home to some here whom I love in the Lord if I
   say that resolutions to be very useful, prayerful and holy are often
   little better than vain thoughts because they are encumbered with
   procrastination. There are many who love the Lord who have never done
   much for Him because the time of figs is not yet. Leaves and leaves,
   only, have they produced. They are live branches of the vine, although
   they have not brought forth many grapes--but they cheer themselves with
   the conviction that one of these days--they do not quite know
   when--they will bring forth clusters as famous us those of Eshcol,
   though, up to now, they have been poor specimens of Christian
   professors! Their mind is made up to rise to a higher life! They will
   grow in Grace! They will give more time to Bible-reading and prayer!
   They will live nearer to God! They will grow to be strong
   Christians--and when that happens they are going to do some great
   thing--I do not know what form their resolution is to take, but they
   will do something extraordinary!

   They will enter the Sunday school and bring scores of little children
   to the Savior's feet. They will commence a class for young men--the
   class is sure to grow and out of it many will come to build up the
   Church of God. They will become fathers or mothers in Israel and their
   children will be many. Or they are going to preach at the village
   stations, draw large congregations and lead hundreds to the Savior!
   They are going to serve the Lord by personal exertion, or to give to
   the cause of God very much of their substance. It has been on their
   hearts a long time to be bountiful benefactors to the poor, to the
   Church at home and to missionaries abroad. They have not given much,
   yet, but before long they intend to overflow like gushing fountains
   which send forth rivers of water! They are resolving--when will they
   come to acting?

   Dear Brothers and Sisters, if we had, any of us, done about half what
   we thought we would do, we would have been tolerably fruitful branches
   of the vine! But we spend so much of our time in this proposing and
   then proposing again, that we have little left for the actual
   performance of anything! We dream with our eyes open, not at night when
   we are asleep and are being really refreshed, but in the day when our
   dreaming does no good, but merely flatters us into a good opinion of
   ourselves. These are vain thoughts, for the Lord deserves to be really
   served--not with imaginary blood were you redeemed--nor with imaginary
   fruit can you reward your Savior's love!

   Not with imaginary woes, nor with a painted death upon a painted Cross
   did Christ ransom us from Hell and do we think to reward Him with
   proposals and plans and schemes and fancies and hopes and resolves? Is
   this your kindness to your Friend? Some men brood so long over their
   future intentions that they, all of them, become addled eggs and
   nothing whatever is hatched! O Man, "whatever your hand finds to do, do
   it!" Do it! Do it "with all your might!" Do not leave it for somebody
   else to do when you are dead! Many make up their minds that a great
   thing shall be done--when they die. When they cannot hold their money
   any longer, then they will give it up--a wonderful sacrifice to God!
   But he that would serve God acceptably determines, "I will give Him of
   my substance while it is mine and not when it is my

   heir's."

   My dear Friend, I would have you regret your idleness! It is infinitely
   better to get to work and perform the little which you are able to
   do--to give the Lord your service while you can serve Him--than that
   you should have to lie upstairs trying to amuse yourself or quiet the
   upbraiding of a guilty conscience by proposing to do great things which
   you could not accomplish if you were to set about them and which,
   indeed, you will never even so much as attempt!

   I have thus mentioned to you several groups of bad lodgers, of whom the
   text says, "How long shall vain thoughts lodge within you?" "How long,"
   says God to every Christian here that has loitered, lingered,
   hesitated--"How long shall vain thoughts lodge within you?" Perform at
   once the doing of that which you have resolved, if, indeed, the resolve
   is such as you ought to have made. God help you, by His sacred Spirit,
   to lead a practical life and not a dreamy one!

   II. Now, secondly, let me show WHAT BAD LODGERS THEY ARE. Vain thoughts
   get admittance into our heads and hearts and there they make themselves
   at home and do mischief without end. They run upstairs and downstairs
   and all over the house and they multiply every day. They are dreadful
   pests--the worst lodgers the soul can harbor. For, first, they are
   deceitful. The man that says, "When I have a more convenient season I
   will send for you," does not ever send for Paul--He never intended to
   do so. A man says, "Tomorrow," but tomorrow never comes. When that
   comes which would have been, "tomorrow," it is, "today"--and then He
   cries, "Tomorrow"--and so multiplies lies before

   God!

   What deceptiveness it is on the part of any man who knows to do good
   and does it not, that he should think to put off God with empty
   promises! Now, listen to this--"To him that knows to do good and does
   it not, to him it is sin." "Sin." That is God's word, not mine. But you
   ask me, "To him that knows to do good and truly intends to do it, does
   not the intention remove the sin?" I answer decidedly, No! "To him that
   knows to do good and does it not, to him it is sin." So long as he
   refuses to do what he knows to be right, he is sinning and every minute
   that he delays heaps up another sin and so the sin multiplies like
   money that is borrowed at compound interest! The amount of guilt runs
   up and you never know what it comes to.

   Delay in performing duty is the most mischievous evil, doing infinite
   damage to the heart in which it lodges because it defiles it with
   falsehood upon falsehood and thus provokes the Most High. Oh, I would
   turn such a lodger as that out! David said, "He that tells lies shall
   not tarry in my house." Do not suffer these vain thoughts to lodge a
   day longer, for they disgrace you and place you in jeopardy. Vain
   thoughts are bad lodgers, for they pay no rent--they bring in nothing
   good to those who entertain them. There is the lodger of
   self-righteousness, for instance. What good does self-righteousness
   ever do to the man who entertains it? It pretends to pay in brass
   farthings--it pretends to pay--but the money is counterfeit!

   What good does it do any man to harbor in his mind the empty promise of
   future repentance? It often prevents repentance! I would rather hear a
   man say straight out, "Now, look here. I never mean to repent or
   believe! My mind is made up as to that matter." This, at least, is
   truthful. That man will, perhaps, change his mind, or God will change
   it. But that other man--the soft, putty-like being, the India rubber
   man--squeeze him; pull him out; force him together again. Do what you
   will with him, he gets back into his old shape! There is no solid stuff
   in him. You cannot make anything of him. These irresolute men,
   "unstable as water," cannot excel. They are neither good for use nor
   for ornament and we have plenty of this class! Are you one of them, my
   Friend? If so, God help you to get rid of these bad lodgers of
   instability, self-sufficiency and constantly promising, because they
   pay no rent. And as for you Christian people who are always on the
   verge of being splendid--you members of churches who are always going
   to be generous, who are quite certain that you shall be useful, only
   you never are--what profit has ever come to God or yourself from this
   continued hesitation? Let such a lodger as that depart at once, for the
   longer he lingers the more will you lose by him.

   The next reason for the ejectment of these lodgers is this--they are
   wasting your goods and destroying your property. For instance, every
   unacted resolution wastes time and that is more precious than gold. It
   also wastes thought, for to think of a thing and to leave it undone is
   a waste of reflection. It is a waste of energy to be energetic about
   merely promising to be energetic! It is a great waste of strength to be
   forever resolving to be strong and yet to remain weak. You screw
   yourself up to the sticking-point and you are going to be holy and yet
   never are! You mean to turn to God and yet never do. Why, you are
   wasting time! You are wasting thought! You are wasting opportunity! You
   are wasting the Gospel under which you sit! These bad lodgers are
   causing you such daily loss that before long you will be utterly ruined
   unless you can cleanse your house of them! You cannot afford to give
   them shelter--send them packing at once! Worse than their damaging your
   house, they are damaging you!

   Bad lodgers will break your windows, burn your shutters, pull down your
   wainscots and do a thousand spiteful things. When they will neither pay
   nor go, they will do all the mischief they can! And thus do vain
   thoughts--foolish, ineffectual thoughts--work us grievous ill, for the
   man that resolves and does not carry out the resolve grows in irreso-

   lution. He that yesterday said he would, but today does not, may today
   say he will, but there will not be so much strength in his resolve as
   there was in that of yesterday. And since he failed yesterday, he is
   even more certain to fail now. A man that has been 10 years making up
   his mind to think about eternity is 10 degrees less likely to do so. A
   man who has had 10 years' sermons earnestly driven at him and yet they
   have not penetrated him, is as one that has been 10 years hammered on
   the anvil and is just so much the harder. O, how men are hardened,
   besotted, befooled and enslaved by vain thoughts! How long will you let
   these lodge within you? Shall they remain till they have plundered you
   of heart and hope and left your mind a wreck and ruin?

   Worst of all, these vain thoughts are bad lodgers because they bring
   you under condemnation. There have been times when to entertain certain
   persons was treason and many individuals have been put to death for
   harboring traitors. Rebels condemned to die have been discovered in a
   man's house and he has been condemned for affording them a hiding
   place. Now, God declares that these vain thoughts of yours are
   condemned traitors. Are you going to harbor them any longer? If a
   lodger came to your house and, after a while, a policeman called and
   said, "You let your front room, I think." "Yes." "What kind of a person
   is your lodger and what is his business?" I think after one or two
   visits of that kind you would say to your lodger, "I shall be obliged
   if you will go somewhere else," for you would not enjoy the idea of
   having a suspected person within your doors. Nobody does.

   Now, these vain thoughts, these self-righteous thoughts, these boasts
   in self--they are something more than sus-pected--they have been judged
   and condemned to die! And, oh, let not your heart become a haunt for
   things that God abhors! And when He sends a summons, as He does tonight
   in the words of the text, "How long shall your vain thoughts lodge
   within you?" oh, that God would grant you Grace to drive out the
   Canaanites who will dwell in the land as long as they can find a den to
   hide in! Let Beddome's hymn be your prayer--

   "Astonished and distressed,

   I turn my eyes within:

   My heart with loads of guilt oppressed,

   The seat of every sin.

   What crowds of evil thoughts,

   What vile affections there!

   Envy and pride, deceit and guile,

   Distrust and slavish fear

   Almighty King of saints,

   These tyrant lusts subdue;

   Drive the old serpent from his seat,

   And all my pow'rs renew.

   This done, my cheerful voice

   Shall loud hosannas raise;

   My soul shall glow with gratitude,

   My lips proclaim Your praise." III. That brings me to my closing head,
   which is LET US SEE WHAT TO DO WITH THESE BAD LODGERS. The first thing
   is to give them notice to leave at once. Let there be no waiting. When
   a man is converted, it is done at once. There may be a long process by
   which he comes up to it and there may be a long succession of the
   breaking Light of God before he gets clear about it, but there is a
   turning point. There is a line, thin as a razor's edge, which divides
   death from life--a point of decision which separates the saved from the
   lost. Did you ever notice, in our Lord's parable of the prodigal son,
   the decision of the repenting one? He said, "I will arise and go unto
   my father"--and he arose and went to his father and, as I heard a
   quaint Divine say, he did not give his master a day's notice!

   The narrative tells us that he had joined himself to a citizen of that
   country who had sent him into the fields to feed swine. He ran off,
   then and there, just as he was! If he had gone to see his master and
   had said, "Sir, I am obliged to go home and see my father," or if he
   had stopped to clean himself--if he had stopped to purchase better
   linen and a fairer suit of clothes before he went home, he would have
   died of hunger at the swine trough. But, instead of that, he did the
   right thing--he ran for his life--and that is what you must do. "Well,
   I shall, I hope," says one. You never will, my Friend, if you get no
   farther than that! It must be done at once. And, possibly, it is, "now
   or never"--before the clock ticks again.

   Will you have Christ and go to Heaven, or your sins and go to Hell?
   Quick! Sharp! God help you to answer aright, for on that answer may
   hang eternal things! I believe that it is always so. Men decide at
   once, or not at all. It was so with me. I was thinking, as I stood up
   here to preach, that this is just the kind of weather in which I found
   the Savior. Some did not come out that morning, it snowed so hard. But
   I had a heavy heart and I wanted to lighten it and so I went out to the
   place of worship and when I heard the Gospel and he that preached it
   said to me, "Look! Look, young man! Look, now!" I did, then and there,
   look to Jesus, otherwise I had never looked! When the Word of God came
   to me, by His Grace, I immediately received it!

   There is one heavy knock, sometimes, at a man's door and he must open
   then, or no other knock may come. I think that somebody has come in
   here tonight that, in God's name, I may give that knock at his heart.
   And if the door is opened and he says, "Come in, blessed Savior," then
   it shall be well. The first thing, then, is to give a notice to leave
   to all self-righteousness. Away with it! Away with it! What a fool I
   was ever to have any! All self-confidence--away with it! I had better
   lean on a broken reed than lean on myself! To all delays--to all hopes
   that I shall live another week--away with them! Away with them! I have
   no ground for such hopes. Away with them! Leave, leave, vain thoughts!
   Oh, that they would go at the bidding!

   Suppose that these vain thoughts will not go just when you bid them to
   go? I will tell you what to do to get rid of them--starve them out!
   Lock the door and let nothing enter upon which they can feed. I would
   have you unconverted people say, "We confess that we have fed our vain
   thoughts, but now we will not go where they can get food. We will not
   go to ungodly amusements, nor into evil company, nor will we talk with
   idlers on our way home." Send into your heart what you know vain
   thoughts cannot be nourished upon--what will be poison to them. Give
   them God's Word! Read it and study it and cry to God to have mercy upon
   you. Do nothing which will help these vain thoughts live.

   I will tell you a secret and then I have done. The best way in all the
   world that I know of to get rid of vain thoughts out of your
   house--these bad lodgers that have gone in and that you cannot get
   out--is to sell the house over their heads. Let the house change
   owners! When you have done that, you know, it will be the new Owner
   that will have the trouble of turning them out--and He will do it. I
   recommend every sinner here that wants to find salvation to give
   himself up to Christ. Come out, you vain thoughts! They will not come
   out. We give you a notice of eviction--but they will not go!

   Now we will tell them something that will change the nature of the
   struggle. Lord Jesus, I trust You to be my Savior from every form of
   evil and I am not my own, now, for You have bought me with a price. Ah,
   now the stronger than they are has come and He will bind the strong
   ones and He will fling them out of the window and so break them to
   pieces with their fall that they shall never be able to crawl up the
   stairs again! He knows how to do it! He can expel them--you cannot. Oh,
   that you might have Grace, now, to give your whole nature to your
   Creator and Redeemer! Give the house over to the new Owner and let Him
   come and He will drive them out and He, Himself, will come and live
   there and His Divine Spirit will come and fill every chamber with His
   own Presence and there shall be no fear that these bad lodgers shall
   ever come back again!

   God bless this simple word to many, for His name's sake. Amen.

I Was Before

   (No. 1574)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious." 1 Timothy
   1:13.

   I AM not going to dwell, at this time, upon the special items of the
   text as to what Paul was before his conversion because none of us have
   been exactly as he was. We have all gone astray like lost sheep, but
   each one of us has taken a distinct course from all the rest. You might
   have to describe your transgressions in very different words from those
   used by the Apostle because yours have been a different form of guilt
   from his. Paul said of himself that he, "was before a blasphemer and a
   persecutor and injurious." Saul of Tarsus was a blasphemer. He does not
   say that he was an unbeliever and an objector, but he uses a very
   strong word, though not too strong, and says that he was a blasphemer.

   He was a down-right, thorough-going blasphemer who also caused others
   to blaspheme. From blasphemy, which is a sin of the lips, Saul
   proceeded to persecution, which is a sin of the hands. Hating Christ,
   he hated His people, too. He was also injurious, which I think Bengel
   considers to mean that he was a despiser. That eminent critic says,
   "blasphemy was his sin towards God, persecution was his sin towards the
   Church and despising was his sin in his own heart." He was
   injurious--that is, he did all he could to damage the cause of Christ
   and, thereby, injured himself. He kicked against the pricks and by
   doing so injured his own conscience. Having sinned thus grievously,
   Paul makes a full confession of his guilt in order that he may magnify
   the Divine Grace which saved, even, the chief of sinners.

   Note here, before we come to the special purpose we have in view, that
   godly men never think or speak lightly of their sins. When they know
   that they are forgiven, they repent of their iniquities even more
   heartily than before. They never infer the lightness of sin from the
   freeness of Grace, but quite the contrary--and you shall find it as one
   trait in the character of every true penitent that he is rather
   inclined to blacken himself than to whitewash his transgressions. He
   sometimes speaks of himself in terms which others think must be
   exaggerated, though to him and, indeed, to God, they are simply true.

   You have probably read biographies of John Bunyan in which the
   biographer says that Bunyan labored under a morbid conscientiousness
   and accused himself of a degree of sin of which he was not guilty.
   Exactly so, in the view of the biographer, but not so in the view of
   John Bunyan, who, startled into sensitiveness of conscience, could not
   find words strong enough to express all his reprobation of himself. Job
   once said, "I abhor myself." That is a very strong expression but, when
   he saw his own sin in the Presence of God, the man of whom the Lord
   said unto Satan, "There is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an
   upright man, one that fears God and eschews evil," the man against whom
   the devil, himself, could not bring an accusation, yet says that when
   he saw God, the brightness of the Divine Holiness made him so conscious
   of his sin that he exclaimed, "Now my eye sees You, I abhor myself and
   repent in dust and ashes."

   Those who have seen the exceeding sinfulness of sin by the light of the
   Holy Spirit and who have been made truly penitent are the last persons
   to speak lightly of evil! They dwell upon their own criminality with
   many terms to set forth how greatly they have felt it. We will consider
   the case of Paul for just a minute or two because it is a type and
   pattern of the work of God's Grace in other Believers. He tells us in
   the 16th verse of this chapter, "For this cause I obtained mercy, that
   in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a
   pattern to them which should hereafter believe on Him to life
   everlasting." He was a model convert, a typical instance of Divine
   long-suffering, a pattern and specimen of all who believe on Christ and
   all conversions are, to a large extent, similar to that which
   transformed the blaspheming, persecuting, despising Saul of Tarsus into
   the great Apostle of the Gentiles!

   Now, notice when he is describing his own past life how he dwells upon
   it with painful minuteness. He is not speaking before God in private,
   as Job was in the words we have quoted, else I can conceive that he
   would paint his sin in still darker colors. But he is answering for
   himself before king Agrippa, touching the things of which he had been
   accused by the Jews and you will see that he puts his offense against
   Christ and His Church in as strong a light as he very well could. His
   enemies have no such accusation to bring against him as that which he
   voluntarily makes against himself! First, he

   says in the 10th verse of the 26th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles,
   which we read just now, "Many of the saints did I shut up in prison."

   Those whom he shut up in prison were saints. To imprison the guilty is
   no fault, but to maltreat and shut up holy men was, indeed,
   blameworthy. He confessed that they were saints, saintly persons, but
   he committed them to prison for that very reason, because they were
   Christians and, therefore, their saintly lives did not protect them
   from his malice, but made them so much the more objects of his cruel
   hatred. He says that he hunted the saints--and not merely a few of
   them, but, "Many of the saints did I shut up in prison." He lays stress
   upon the word, "many"--not half-a-dozen here and there--but scores and
   hundreds suffered through him and his persecuting band. He crowded the
   prisons with the followers of Jesus Christ! "He that touches you
   touches the apple of His eye," says the Lord of Hosts when addressing
   captive Zion.

   One touch of a saint of God injuriously given will be painful to the
   Lord--how much more, then, when there are many such touches and when he
   whose hand has done the evil deed has to confess--"Many of the saints
   did I shut up in prison"? We may be quite sure that he did this because
   they were Christians, for the 9th verse puts it thus, "I verily thought
   with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of
   Jesus of Nazareth." It was Jesus of Nazareth he was aiming at, though
   his blows were directed against His followers. It was because the name
   of Jesus was named upon these people that they were put in prison!

   Now, this is no small sin--to persecute holy men, to imprison many of
   them and to do so simply because they believed in Jesus Christ. The
   Apostle felt that this put exceeding bitterness into the gall of his
   transgression--that he had lifted up unholy hands against the members
   of Christ's body and through them had wounded their ever-glorious Head.
   More than this, he did not merely put them in prison, but, he says,
   "Many of the saints did I shut up in prison." Some persons in prison
   have had a measure of liberty, as Joseph had, but Saul took care that
   these Believers should be shut up--that they should have no liberty at
   all! He put them into the common jails, locked them up and made their
   feet fast in the stocks, causing them to suffer even as he and his
   companion, Silas, afterwards did in the prison at Philippi.

   Continuing the summary of his evil against the servants of the Lord, he
   says, "I was not content with their imprisonment, but I was eager for
   their death. When they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.
   When the Sanhedrim wanted a vote I, young Saul, was there to give my
   maiden vote against Stephen or any other saint. If the chief priests
   wanted a knife to cut the Christians' throats with, there was I ready
   to do the deed. If they needed one who would drag them away to prison
   and to death, there stood I, the eager messenger, only too glad if I
   might lay hands upon them, believing that I was, thereby, doing God
   service."

   "No," he says, "that is not all. I often punished them in every
   synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme." This, indeed, was a very
   horrible part of Saul's sinfulness. To destroy their bodies was bad
   enough, but to destroy their souls if that were possible--to compel
   them to blaspheme, to speak evil of that name which they confessed to
   be their joy and their hope--surely that was the worst form that
   persecution could assume! He forced them under torture to renounce the
   Christ whom their hearts loved! As it were, he was not content to kill
   them, but he must damn them, if it were possible, too. "I compelled
   them to blaspheme." This was a dreadful sin and Paul mentions it as
   such. He does not extenuate his crime, nor attempt to find excuses for
   his conduct.

   And then he adds, once more, that he did all this wickedness with the
   greatest possible enthusiasm--"And being exceedingly mad against them,"
   like a raging madman in his fits, like a violent maniac who cannot be
   held in--seized with frenzy, tearing right and left, finding no rest
   unless he could be harrying and worrying the sheep like a bloody wolf,
   as he was to the sheep of Christ's flock. "Being exceedingly mad
   against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities." He scattered
   them far and wide and then sought to get authority that even when they
   were in exile they might not be beyond his reach!

   Saul seems to have grown proficient in the science of persecution and
   to have become a very master in the cruel art of crushing the people of
   God. We do not learn this from James, or John, or any of the other
   Apostles. Who tells us of all this? Who makes out this long, black
   catalog of crimes of which the man who committed them might well be
   ashamed? Why, Paul himself! It is Paul himself that puts it so and I
   would that, in like manner, the worst character you could have, my
   Brother, might come from your own lips. "Let another man praise you and
   not your own mouth; a stranger and not your own lips." But, when there
   is an accusation that must be made against you, be you the first to
   make it with tears of repentance before the living God!

   I think I have thus, from the example of Paul before Agrippa, justified
   the expression with which I started--that true penitents do not seek to
   extenuate or diminish the sin which has been forgiven them, but they
   acknowledge how great it is and set it forth in all its enormity as it
   appears before their enlightened eyes. Now, I want you, dear Friends,
   who know the Lord, to follow me in a very simple way, rather by your
   emotions than by anything else. I want the text of my sermon to be, "I
   was." The Apostle tells us what he was--what he was before conversion.
   Now, I want you to think what you were before the Grace of God met with
   you and changed you.

   I do not know that I shall help you much to remember the details of
   your sin, for pretty near the last time I stood here, I did that when
   we spoke of Peter from the words--"When he thought thereon, he wept,"
   [Fountain of Repentant Tears--Sermon #2735, Volume 47--Read July 14,
   1901--Preached October 24, 1880.] but I want you to see seven very
   profitable inferences which will arise out of an impartial retrospect
   of your life before conversion.

   I. The first, I think, will be that IF WE THINK OF WHAT WE WERE, IT
   WILL EXCITE IN US ADORING GRATITUDE. Paul was full of gratitude, for he
   thanked Christ Jesus that He counted him faithful, putting him into the
   ministry. He is so glad of the favor of God that when he comes to the
   17th verse he must put down his pen while he sings, "Now unto the King
   eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory
   forever and ever. Amen." If, then, you and I look back upon what we
   were before the Lord saved us, we, too, shall be full of adoring
   gratitude as we think of even the least of all the favors that He has
   bestowed upon us!

   "I am not worthy," said the Patriarch, Jacob, when he was returning to
   his country at the command of God--"I am not worthy of the least of all
   the mercies and of all the truth which You have shown unto Your
   servant." And we can, each one, say the same. Is it not a wonderful
   thing that you who were--I will not say what--you know what you were
   and God knows! Isn't it wonderful, I say, that you should be a teacher
   of others? That you should be permitted to stand up and speak of pardon
   bought with blood? That you should be allowed to talk of holiness
   though your lips used to speak of any other theme but that?

   Isn't it wonderful that you should be allowed to extol the Christ for
   whom you had no words of praise a little while ago, for whom, indeed,
   you had only words of contempt and scorn? Paul was astonished to think
   that he was put into the ministry! And when I look back upon my own
   life before I knew the Lord, I am amazed that I should ever stand here,
   seeing that for so long I refused my Lord's love and put aside His
   favors and would have none of them! Ah, I did not know what would
   happen to me one day. Little did I think then that I should ever stand
   here to--

   "Tell to sinners round, What a dear Savior I have found."

   But it does fill me with gratitude which makes me bow before God in
   thankful adoration to think that He should have looked on me and to
   know that, "unto me," as well as unto Paul, "is this Grace given, that
   I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ."

   I ask you, dear Friends, to remember this gratitude in the reception of
   every blessing. When you enjoy Church privileges; when you come to the
   Communion Table, think, "Here comes one to sit with the children of God
   who once was like a dog outside the house." When you stand up and
   praise the Lord, think, "And I, too, am permitted to offer the
   sacrifice of praise--I, who once sang the praises of Bacchus or of
   Venus--rather than of Christ Jesus!" When you draw near to God in
   prayer and know that He hears you, too--when you have power in prayer
   and prevail with the Most High and come back with your hands full of
   blessings that have been obtained at the Throne of Grace, you may well
   say, "What shameful things these hands once did when I rendered my
   members instruments of unrighteousness--and now they are loaded down
   with the bounties of a gracious God!"

   Oh, do bless His name! If you do not, the stones in the street will
   begin to cry out against some of you! Oh, if your heart does not leap
   at the very sound of the name of Jesus, surely you cannot possess a
   heart at all! Such a change, such a wondrous, matchless change has
   passed upon you that if you do not praise the Lord today and tomorrow
   and as long as you have any being, what shall be said of your
   ungrateful silence? "I was"--I was before--all that I ought not to have
   been, but Grace has changed me and unto the God of Grace be all the
   glory! Do not all of you who love the Lord unite with me in this
   utterance of adoring gratitude?

   II. A second very blessed inference (we can only speak briefly upon
   each one) is that A SENSE OF WHAT WE WERE SHOULD SUSTAIN IN US VERY
   DEEP HUMILITY. It did so hn the case of the Apostle Paul and I would
   refer you to his expression of it in the First Epistle to the
   Corinthians, the 15th chapter and the 9th verse, where he says, "I am

   the least of the Apostles, that am not meet to be called an Apostle
   because I persecuted the church of God." When He was compelled to glory
   in what he was through the Grace given to him, he said that he supposed
   he was not a whit behind the very chief Apostles, yet he here says of
   himself that he was not worthy to be called an Apostle because before
   his conversion he persecuted the saints of God!

   Now, dear Brothers and Sisters, if we have been a little while
   converted and have united with the Church of God and the Lord has given
   us a little work to do, we may be tempted to think, "Now, I am
   somebody! Really, I am not now quite the humble dependent that I used
   to be. I am getting to be of some service to my Lord and Master and I
   am of some importance in His Church." Ah, that is the way many
   Christians get into sad mischief. "Pride goes before destruction and a
   haughty spirit before a fall." You must always strive against that kind
   of spirit and one way to avoid it is to remember what you were in your
   unregenerate state. There are some who might say, "I am a minister of
   the Gospel, but I am not worthy to be called a minister because of the
   sins that I committed before my conversion. I am a member of the Church
   of Christ, but I am scarcely worthy to be called a member because I was
   a blasphemer, or a Sabbath-breaker, or profane, unchaste, or
   dishonest."

   Remember what you were and let your spiritual advancements never lead
   you to unspiritual pride and self-conceit for, "everyone that is proud
   in heart is an abomination to the Lord." I have heard of a good man in
   Germany who used to rescue poor, destitute boys from the streets and he
   always had them photographed in their rags and filth just as he found
   them. And then, years afterwards, when they were clothed and washed and
   educated and their characters began to develop, if they grew proud he
   would show them what they were and try to teach them what they would
   have likely been it had not been for his charity. If you are inclined
   to lift up your head and boast what a great man you are, now--just look
   at the likeness of what you were before the Lord made you a new
   creature in Christ Jesus!

   Oh, who can tell what that likeness would have been but for the
   interpositions of Divine Grace? I think you would say what the Scotsman
   said to Rowland Hill when he called to see the good man in his study.
   He sat and looked at him. And Rowland Hill's face, you know, if you
   have seen his portrait, is one to be remembered--there is a peculiar
   comic look about it. So the Scotsman said, in answer to the question,
   "What are you looking at?" "I have been studying the lines of your
   face." "And what do you make out of them?" said Mr. Hill. "Why, that if
   the Grace of God had not made you a Christian, you would have been one
   of the worst fellows that ever lived." "Ah!" said Mr. Hill, "you have
   hit the mark this time!"

   I should not wonder, too, if some of us, when we look in the mirror,
   were to see somebody there that would have been a very deep-dyed sinner
   if it had not been for the change of heart which Sovereign Grace has
   worked. This ought to keep us very humble and very lowly before God. I
   invite you, Friends, to think this over and when you feel yourselves
   beginning to swell a little, let the bladder of your foolish and wicked
   pride be pricked with the needle of conscience as you remember what you
   used to be and you will be all the better for letting some of the gas
   escape! Come back as speedily as you can to your fine shape, for what
   are you, after all? If you are anything that is good, or right, or
   pleasing in the eyes of the Lord, you must still say, "By the Grace of
   God I am what I am."--

   "All that I was, my sin, my guilt,

   My death, was all my own.

   All that I am, I owe to You,

   My gracious God, alone.

   The evil of my former state

   Was mine and only mine.

   The good in which I now rejoice

   Is Thine and only Thine."

   Well, those are two of the inferences which result from looking back at
   what you were--the retrospect excites gratitude and sustains humility.

   III. The next is this--THE REMEMBRANCE OF OUR FORMER CONDITION SHOULD
   RENEW IN US GENUINE REPENTANCE. When we look back upon what we used to
   be before the Lord met with us, it should breed in us a perpetual
   repentance. There are some who seem to think that we only repent of sin
   when we are first converted. Do not be deluded by any such false
   notion! When you leave off repenting, you have left off living! You are
   not living for God as you ought to do unless you daily repent. Remember
   that we are not saved by a single act of faith which terminates the
   moment we receive the assurance of the Divine forgiveness, but by a
   faith which continues as long as we live and,

   therefore, as long as we have any faith we must have repentance, too,
   for these are twin Graces--faith with a bright eye, like Rachel, who
   was beautiful and well-favored--and repentance, tender-eyed, like Leah,
   but with a lovely eye for all that.

   "Repentance," says one, "why, I thought that was a bitter thing that
   was taken away when we believed!" No, it is a sweet thing--I could wish
   to repent in Heaven, though I suppose I shall not. We cannot carry the
   tear of penitence in our eyes into Heaven--it will be the only thing we
   might regret to leave behind. Surely we shall be sorry, even there, for
   having grieved our God. Even there, I think, we shall repent, but
   certainly as long as we are here we must daily repent of sin! Yes, and
   repent of the sin that is forgiven--repent more because it is forgiven
   than we did when we had any doubts about its being pardoned--

   "My sins, my sins, my Savior! How sad on You they fall, Seen through
   Your gentle patience, I tenfold feel them all. I know they are
   forgiven, But still their pain to me Is all the grief and anguish They
   laid, my Lord, on Thee."

   Smite on your breasts while you think that it was necessary that Christ
   should die that you might be delivered from sin and its penalty and
   power--and as your love increases, let your sorrow abound that such a
   Lord should have needed to be crucified for you.

   Oh, Sin, as Christ becomes more lovely, you become more hateful and as
   our soul learns more of the beauty of holiness, it perceives more of
   your ugliness and so continually loathes you more and more! If you want
   to draw up the sluices of repentance, sit down and remember what you
   were by nature and would have remained if Grace had not intervened! So,
   then, it shall be good for you to say, "I was before a blasphemer and a
   persecutor and injurious," or to use any other expression that shall
   accurately describe you, if it leads you, like Peter, to go out and
   weep bitterly true tears of repentance.

   IV. And now, fourthly, (we have but a word on each inference, you
   see)--THE RETROSPECT OF OUR PAST

   LIVES SHOULD KINDLE IN US FERVENT LOVE to the Lord who has redeemed us.
   You remember Christ went into

   the house of one of the Pharisees who had a measure of respect for
   Him--this was Simon who desired Him to eat with him. But when He
   entered in, Simon treated Him as a common guest and offered Him none of
   the delicate attentions which men give to choice friends or to
   superiors. Christ took no note of this, nor had He need to do so, for
   there was another who stole into that room who did for Him all that
   Simon ought to have done and more than Simon could have done!

   "A woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat
   at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment
   and stood at His feet behind Him weeping." She stood behind the couch
   upon which He was reclining and let her tears fall down upon His
   blessed flesh till she had washed His feet with them and then,
   unbraiding the luxurious tresses of her hair, she wiped those holy feet
   with them! Her love, her humility, her adoration and her penitence were
   all mingling as she kissed His feet and anointed them with the ointment
   which she had brought. Our Lord explained why this woman had performed
   this extraordinary action. He said it was because she had been forgiven
   much.

   Now, rest assured that there is no exception to this rule--that those
   who are conscious of having had much forgiven are those who will love
   Christ much! I do not say--I almost wish I could--that love is always
   in proportion to the amount of sin forgiven, but I do say that it is in
   proportion to the consciousness of sin forgiven. A man may be a less
   sinner than another, but he may be more conscious of his sin and he
   will be the man who will love Christ more. Oh, do not forget what you
   were, lest you should become unmindful of your obligation to Jesus! You
   are saints, now, but you were not always so. You can talk to others of
   Christ, now, but you could not once have done it. You can wrestle with
   the Angel of God in prayer and prevail, now, but once you were more
   familiar with the devil than you were with the Angel!

   At this moment your heart bears witness to the indwelling of the Holy
   Spirit--it is not long ago that the Prince of the power of the air
   worked within you and the Holy Spirit was not there at all! I beseech
   you, therefore, forget not this, lest you forget to love Him who has
   worked this wondrous change in you! I think there is nothing better
   than to retain a vivid sense of conversion in order to retain a vivid
   sense of love. Do not be afraid of loving Christ too much. I see the
   cold

   carping criticism of this age objects to any expressions of love to
   Christ which we use in our hymns because it says that they are
   sensuous. My only answer to such talk is--God give us more of such
   blessed sensuousness!

   I think that instead of diminishing these utterances it will be a token
   of growth in Grace when they are more abundant--not if they become so
   common as to be hypocritical. Then they would be sickening, but as long
   as they are true and honest, I, for one, would say to you who love the
   Lord, go on and sing--

   "Safe in the arms of Jesus, Safe on His gentle breast."

   Go on and sing--

   "Jesus, I love Your charming name, 'Tis music to my ear."

   Hesitate not to say--

   "You, dear Redeemer, dying Lamb, We love to hear of You"

   and if it shall please you and the Spirit shall move you, even say,
   like the spouse in the song, "Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His
   mouth: for Your love is better than wine." The starveling religion of
   the present day, not content with tearing away the doctrinal flesh from
   the spiritual body, is now seeking to drag out the very heart of
   religion and to reduce Christian experience to nothing but a chilly
   doubting of everything! Let this be far from you! Believe something and
   love something, for to believe is to live, and to love is to be in
   health.

   Oh for more love arising out of a deep, intense sense of what we once
   were and of the change which Christ has worked in us! "But," says one,
   "I do not know that any great change has been worked in me." No and
   there are some who tell us that we do not need any. There are certain
   Paedobaptists preaching, nowadays, that most children of pious parents
   do not need conversion. We have long had the Church of England teaching
   us baptismal regeneration--now we have some Nonconformists trying to
   persuade us that no regeneration at all is needed! This a new kind of
   doctrine that I know nothing of and that the Word of God knows nothing
   of and it will not do for us! It will eat out the very life of
   Christianity if it is believed.

   Pious ancestors could not save one of you--even if your fathers and
   mothers and grandfathers and grandmothers and great-grandfathers and
   great-grandmothers and great-great-great-great-grandfathers and
   great-great-great-great-grandmothers--as far back as ever you like--had
   been all saints, nevertheless, their faith could not be of any use to
   you! You must be born, "not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor
   of the will of man, but of God." "You must be born again" is as true of
   one child as of another--as true of you as it was of me and as true of
   me as of the thief confined in prison today.

   But some of us have been changed--we are washed, we are sanctified, we
   are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our
   God. It has been a real work of Divine Grace--the turning of us upside
   down, the reversing of the course of Nature, a turning of night into
   day, a turning of the powers of our spirit from the dominion of Satan
   to the dominion of Christ--and we must and will, therefore, love Him
   who has worked in us such a wondrous transformation!

   V. Well now, fifthly, REMEMBERING WHAT WE WERE, ARDENT ZEAL SHOULD BE
   AWAKENED IN US.

   Look at Paul. He says, "I was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and
   injurious." What then? Why, now that he has become a follower of
   Christ, he cannot do too much! He put many saints in prison--now he
   goes into many prisons, himself. He hunted them even to strange
   cities--and now he goes into all manner of strange cities, himself. He
   dragged them before tribunals and now he, himself goes and stands
   before Roman proconsuls and before the Roman emperor, himself! Paul can
   never do too much for Christ because he had done so much for Satan!

   I remember one who lived four or five miles away from a place of
   worship who used to say, "You old legs, it is no use being tired, for
   you have got to carry me. You used to take me to the place of amusement
   when I served the devil and you shall carry me, now, to the House of
   God that I may worship and serve Him." When sometimes he had an uneasy
   seat, he used to say, "It is no use grumbling, old bones, you will have
   to sit here, or else you will have to stand. Years ago you put up with
   all kinds of inconveniences when I went to the theater, or some other
   evil place when I served Satan--and you must now be content to do the
   same now for a better Master and a nobler service."

   I think some of us might take a lesson from that old man and say to
   ourselves, "Come, Covetousness, you are not going to hinder me from
   serving the Lord. I used to be liberal to the devil and I do not
   intend, now, to be stingy with God." If ever I am tempted in that
   fashion, I will give twice as much as I had thought of doing, so as to
   spite the devil, for

   he shall not have his way with me! Some, when they serve Satan, go as
   if they rode a racehorse and whip and spur to get in first. How they
   will destroy body and soul in the service of the Evil One! But if a
   Christian gets a little lively they say, "Oh, dear me, dear me, he is
   excited! He is fanatical! He has grown enthusiastic!"

   Why should he not be in earnest? The devil's servants are enthusiastic
   and why should not the servants of Christ be the same? Black Prince,
   Black Prince, are you served by heroes and shall Christ be served by
   dolts? Oh, let it not be so, my Brothers and Sisters! Surely if
   anything can wake up all the powers of our nature; if anything can make
   a lame man leap as a hart; if anything can make a palpitating,
   trembling heart to be bold and brave for Christ, it should be the love
   which Christ has shown in looking upon such as we were and changing us
   by His Grace! "Ah, but you must not do too much," says one. Did you
   ever know anybody who did?

   If anybody ever does too much for Christ, let us rail off a piece in
   the cemetery that we may bury him in it. That grave will never be
   needed--it will be empty till Christ comes! "Ah, but you may have too
   many irons in the fire." It depends upon the size of the fire! Get your
   fire well hot--I mean get your heart well hot and your nature in a
   blaze--then put all the irons you can ever get, into it! Keep them all
   at a white heat if possible. Blow away and let the flames be very
   vehement. Oh, to live for God a life of ecstatic zeal even if it were
   only for a short space of time! It were better than to have a hundred
   years of bare existence in which one went crawling along like a snail,
   leaving slime behind and nothing else. It were better far than
   driveling out, as oftentimes we do--

   "Our souls can neither fly nor go To reach eternal joys." The love of
   Christ to us, then, suggests great zeal in His service.

   VI. Now, sixthly, I am sure that another inference that should be drawn
   from it is this--If we remember what we were and how Divine Grace has
   changed us, IT OUGHT TO MAKE US VERY HOPEFUL ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE. Paul
   was, for he says, "This is a faithful saying and worthy of all
   acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of
   whom I am chief. Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me
   first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering for a pattern to
   them which should hereafter believe on Him to life everlasting." Well,
   Friend, are you saved? Then anybody can be! You never ought to despair
   of the salvation of anyone, for you know yourself and feel yourself to
   have been the most undeserving of men--and yet God's Grace has made you
   love Him. Well, then, that Grace can light on anybody. Already it has
   fallen on the most unlikely spot possible!

   Now, from this moment on, never indulge the idea that it is useless to
   attempt to benefit any of your fellow men. I remember--indeed, I have
   often met with persons who tell me of being asked, "Why did you not ask
   So-and-So to attend a place of worship?" "Ask him? Oh, I never thought
   of him." "Why not?" "I did not think it was any use." It is a very
   amazing thing that those are the kind of people who, if you get them to
   hear the Word of God, are generally con-verted--the people you think it
   is no use to bring! Men who have been accustomed to speak very
   disrespectfully of religious things, when once brought under the sound
   of the Truth of God, are often the first to receive a blessing! Those
   are the kind of fellows to seek, for there is some hope of reaching men
   who are in such need of the Gospel we have to proclaim. You know there
   is virgin soil there, so it is the very place to sow the good Seed of
   the kingdom.

   There is good fishing in a pond that never was fished before and here
   is a man who, at any rate, is not Gospel-hardened--he has not got used
   to the sound of the Word so as to take no notice of anything that is
   said. Bring him in! He is the very man we want--bring him in! "But he
   is a swearer." Well, but if you were a swearer before your conversion,
   you ought never to say anything about that. "Oh, but he is a very
   hardened man." Yes, but if you were converted, notwithstanding what you
   were, you ought never to make that objection against anyone. "Oh, but
   he is such a low-bred man." Well, there are plenty of us who cannot
   boast much about our aristocratic descent! "Oh, but," says one, "he is
   such a proud man, such a haughty man." Or, "He is a rich man. He is a
   purse-proud man." Yes, but there are others like he who have been
   brought in and while that man has sinned in one way, you have sinned in
   another--and if the Grace of God met your six, it can meet his
   half-dozen!

   Depend upon it, God meant us to be hopeful about other people when He
   saved us. See that man coming out of the hospital? He has had pretty
   nearly all the diseases you ever heard of and yet he has been cured. He
   is not the man to say, "It is no use going in there. You will get no
   good by putting yourself under the treatment of that doctor." On the
   contrary, whenever he meets with anybody who is suffering, he says,
   "You go and try the physician that healed me. If you can get a bed
   under his care; if you can come under his notice, you are almost
   certain to get cured--your maladies cannot be worse than mine and he
   met my case exactly and he can meet yours." He is the man who will
   advertise Christ and will

   proclaim His fame the whole world over--who has tasted that He is
   gracious and has proven, in his own case, the converting power of the
   Holy Spirit!

   Oh, I pray you, dear Friend, despair of nobody! You who go with your
   tracts, go into the worst houses! You who talk in the workhouses to
   those who are, perhaps, as gladly gone as any--who find them dying in
   the infirmary and rejecting the Word of God as you speak it, yet keep
   on! Keep on! "Never say die" concerning anyone! Since the Lord has
   saved you, the Grace of God can save anybody, however far he may have
   sunk in sin! It can reach even to the very vilest of the sons of men.

   VII. The last inference is that WHAT GOD HAS DONE FOR US SHOULD CONFIRM
   OUR CONFIDENCE FOR OURSELVES--our confidence, not in ourselves, but in
   God who will perfect that which He has begun in us. There is not half
   as much Grace necessary to bring you to Heaven if you are a Believer as
   you have had, already, to bring you where you are! You have got to be
   perfected, but remember that it was the very first step that had the
   difficulty in it. It always reminds me of the legend of St. Denis who
   picked up his head after it was cut off and walked, I think, 40 leagues
   with it. But a wit said that there was no trouble about walking 40
   leagues--the difficulty all lay in the first step!

   So it did and so all the difficulty of the walk of faith lies in the
   first step--that first coming of a dead heart to life! That first
   bringing of a reprobate soul--a carnal mind that is enmity against
   God--into friendship with God. Well, that has been done! That first
   great work has been worked in you by God the Holy Spirit and now you
   can say with the Apostle, "If, when we were enemies, we were reconciled
   to God by the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall
   be saved by His life."

   Do you think the Lord ever converts a man with a view of showing him
   His Light that he may go back, again, into the thick darkness, forever?
   Does He drop a spark of heavenly light into our souls that it may go
   out, never to be rekindled? Does He come and teach us to eat heavenly
   bread and drink the Water of Life and then leave us to starve or die of
   thirst? Does He make us members of Christ's body and then allow us to
   rot and decay? Has He brought us thus far to put us to shame? Has He
   given me a heart that cries after Him and pines for Him! Has He given
   me a sighing after perfection, an inward hunger after everything that
   is holy and true and does He mean, after all, to desert me? It cannot
   be--

   "His love in time past forbids me to think

   He'll leave me at last in trouble to sink.

   That gracious conversion I ha ve in review,

   Confirms His good pleasure to help me quite through." So let us go on
   our way rejoicing that it shall be even so with each one of us. Amen.
