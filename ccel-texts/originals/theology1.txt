CHAPTER I.

  ON METHOD
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Theology a Science.

   In every science there are two factors: facts and ideas; or, facts and
   the mind. Science is more than knowledge. Knowledge is the persuasion
   of what is true on adequate evidence. But the facts of astronomy,
   chemistry, or history do not constitute the science of those
   departments of knowledge. Nor does the mere orderly arrangement of
   facts amount to science. Historical facts arranged in chronological
   order, are mere annals. The philosophy of history supposes those facts
   to be understood in their causal relations. In every department the man
   of science is assumed to understand the laws by which the facts of
   experience are determined; so that he not only knows the past, but can
   predict the future. The astronomer can foretell the relative position
   of the heavenly bodies for centuries to come. The chemist can tell with
   certainty what will be the effect of certain chemical combinations. If,
   therefore, theology be a science, it must include something more than a
   mere knowledge of facts. It must embrace an exhibition of the internal
   relation of those facts, one to another, and each to all. It must be
   able to show that if one be admitted, others cannot be denied.

   The Bible is no more a system of theology, than nature is a system of
   chemistry or of mechanics. We find in nature the facts which the
   chemist or the mechanical philosopher has to examine, and from them to
   ascertain the laws by which they are determined. So the Bible contains
   the truths which the theologian has to collect, authenticate, arrange,
   and exhibit in their internal relation to each other. This constitutes
   the difference between biblical and systematic theology. The office of
   the former is to ascertain and state the facts of Scripture. The office
   of the latter is to take those facts, determine their relation to each
   other and to other cognate truths, as well as to vindicate them and
   show their harmony and consistency. This is not an easy task, or one of
   slight importance.

   Necessity for System in Theology

   It may naturally be asked, why not take the truths as God has seen fit
   to reveal them, and thus save ourselves the trouble of showing their
   relation and harmony?

   The answer to this question is, in the first place, that it cannot be
   done. Such is the constitution of the human mind that it cannot help
   endeavoring to systematize and reconcile the facts which it admits to
   be true. In no department of knowledge have men been satisfied with the
   possession of a mass of undigested facts. And the students of the Bible
   can as little be expected to be thus satisfied. There is a necessity,
   therefore, for the construction of systems of theology. Of this the
   history of the Church affords abundant proof. In all ages and among all
   denominations, such systems have been produced.

   Second, A much higher kind of knowledge is thus obtained, than by the
   mere accumulation of isolated facts. It is one thing, for example, to
   know that oceans, continents, islands, mountains, and rivers exist on
   the face of the earth; and a much higher thing to know the causes which
   have determined the distribution of land and water on the surface of
   our globe; the configuration of the earth; the effects of that
   configuration on climate, on the races of plants and animals, on
   commerce, civilization, and the destiny of nations. It is by
   determining these causes that geography has been raised from a
   collection of facts to a highly important and elevated science. In like
   manner, without the knowledge of the laws of attraction and motion,
   astronomy would be a confused and unintelligible collection of facts.
   What is true of other sciences is true of theology. We cannot know what
   God has revealed in his Word unless we understand, at least in some
   good measure, the relation in which the separate truths therein
   contained stand to each other. It cost the Church centuries of study
   and controversy to solve the problem concerning the person of Christ;
   that is, to adjust and bring into harmonious arrangement all the facts
   which the Bible teaches on that subject.

   Third, We have no choice in this matter. If we would discharge our duty
   as teachers and defenders of the truth, we must endeavor to bring all
   the facts of revelation into systematic order and mutual relation. It
   is only thus that we can satisfactorily exhibit their truth, vindicate
   them from objections, or bring them to bear in their full force on the
   minds of men.

   Fourth, Such is evidently the will of God. He does not teach men
   astronomy or chemistry, but He gives them the facts out of which those
   sciences are constructed. Neither does He teach us systematic theology,
   but He gives us in the Bible the truths which, properly understood and
   arranged, constitute the science of theology. As the facts of nature
   are all related and determined by physical laws, so the facts of the
   Bible are all related and determined by the nature of God and of his
   creatures. And as He wills that men should study his works and discover
   their wonderful organic relation and harmonious combination, so it is
   his will that we should study his Word, and learn that, like the stars,
   its truths are not isolated points, but systems, cycles, and epicycles,
   in unending harmony and grandeur. Besides all this, although the
   Scriptures do not contain a system of theology as a whole, we have in
   the Epistles of the New Testament, portions of that system wrought out
   to our hands. These are our authority and guide.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 2. Theological Method.

   Every science has its own method, determined by its peculiar nature.
   This is a matter of so much importance that it has been erected into a
   distinct department. Modern literature abounds in works on Methodology,
   i.e., on the science of method. They are designed to determine the
   principles which should control scientific investigations. If a man
   adopts a false method, he is like one who takes a wrong road which will
   never lead him to his destination. The two great comprehensive methods
   are the à priori and the à posteriori. The one argues from cause to
   effect, the other from effect to cause. The former was for ages applied
   even to the investigation of nature. Men sought to determine what the
   facts of nature must be from the laws of mind or assumed necessary
   laws. Even in our own day we have had Rational Cosmogonies, which
   undertake to construct a theory of the universe from the nature of
   absolute being and its necessary modes of development. Every one knows
   how much it cost to establish the method of induction on a firm basis,
   and to secure a general recognition of its authority. According to this
   method, we begin with collecting well-established facts, and from them
   infer the general laws which determine their occurrence. From the fact
   that bodies fall toward the centre of the earth, has been inferred the
   general law of gravitation, which we are authorized to apply far beyond
   the limits of actual experience. This inductive method is founded upon
   two principles: First, That there are laws of nature (forces) which are
   the proximate causes of natural phenomena. Secondly, That those laws
   are uniform; so that we are certain that the same causes, under the
   same circumstances, will produce the same effects. There may be
   diversity of opinion as to the nature of these laws. They may be
   assumed to be forces inherent in matter; or, they may be regarded as
   uniform modes of divine operation; but in any event there must be some
   cause for the phenomena which we perceive around us, and that cause
   must be uniform and permanent. On these principles all the inductive
   sciences are founded; and by them the investigations of natural
   philosophers are guided.

   The same principle applies to metaphysics as to physics; to psychology
   as well as to natural science. Mind has its laws as well as matter, and
   those laws, although of a different kind, are as permanent as those of
   the external world.

   The methods which have been applied to the study of theology are too
   numerous to be separately considered. They may, perhaps, be reduced to
   three general classes: First, The Speculative; Second, The Mystical;
   Third, The Inductive. These terms are, indeed, far from being precise.
   They are used for the want of better to designate the three general
   methods of theological investigation which have prevailed in the
   Church.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 3. The Speculative Method.

   Speculation assumes, in an à priori manner, certain principles, and
   from them undertakes to determine what is and what must be. It decides
   on all truth, or determines on what is true from the laws of the mind,
   or from axioms involved in the constitution of the thinking principle
   within us. To this head must be referred all those systems which are
   founded on any à priori philosophical assumptions. There are three
   general forms in which this speculative method has been applied to
   theology.

   Deistic and Rationalistic Form.

   1. The first is that which rejects any other source of knowledge of
   divine things than what is found in nature and the constitution of the
   human mind. It assumes certain metaphysical and moral axioms, and from
   them evolves all the truths which it is willing to admit. To this class
   belong the Deistical and strictly Rationalistical writers of the past
   and present generations.

   Dogmatic Form.

   2. The second is the method adopted by those who admit a a supernatural
   divine revelation, and concede that such a revelation is contained in
   the Christian Scriptures, but who reduce all the doctrines thus
   revealed to the forms of some philosophical system. This was done by
   many of the fathers who endeavored to exalt pistis into gnosis i.e.,
   the faith of the common people into philosophy for the learned. This
   was also to a greater or less degree the method of the schoolmen, and
   finds an illustration even in the "Cur Deus Homo" of Anselm, the father
   of scholastic theology. In later times Wolf applied the philosophy of
   Leibnitz to the explanation and demonstration of the doctrines of
   revelation. He says, "Scripture serves as an aid to natural theology.
   It furnishes natural theology with propositions which ought to be
   demonstrated; consequently the philosopher is bound not to invent but
   to demonstrate." [1] This method is still in vogue. Men lay down
   certain principles, called axioms, or first truths of reason, and from
   them deduce the doctrines of religion by a course of argument as rigid
   and remorseless as that of Euclid. This is sometimes done to the entire
   overthrow of the doctrines of the Bible, and of the most intimate moral
   convictions not only of Christians but of the mass of mankind.
   Conscience is not allowed to mutter in the presence of the lordly
   understanding. It is in the spirit of the same method that the old
   scholastic doctrine of realism is made the basis of the Scriptural
   doctrines of original sin and redemption. To this method the somewhat
   ambiguous term Dogmatism has been applied, because it attempts to
   reconcile the doctrines of Scripture with reason, and to rest their
   authority on rational evidence. The result of this method has always
   been to transmute, as far as it succeeded, faith into knowledge, and to
   attain this end the teachings of the Bible have been indefinitely
   modified. Men are expected to believe, not on the authority of God, but
   on that of reason.

   Transcendentalists.

   3. Thirdly, and preéminently, the modern Transcendentalists are
   addicted to the speculative method. In the wide sense of the word they
   are Rationalists, as they admit of no higher source of truth other
   Reason. But as they make reason to be something very different from
   what it is regarded as being by ordinary Rationalists, the two classes
   are practically very far apart. The Transcendentalists also differ
   essentially from the Dogmatists. The latter admit an external,
   supernatural, and authoritative revelation. They acknowledge that
   truths not discoverable by human reason are thereby made known. But
   they maintain that those doctrines when known may be shown to be true
   on the principles of reason. They undertake to give a demonstration
   independent of Scripture of the doctrines of the Trinity, the
   Incarnation, Redemption, as well as of the immortality of the soul and
   a future state of retribution. Transcendentalists admit of no
   authoritative revelation other than that which is found in man and in
   the historical development of the race. All truth is to be discovered
   and established by a process of thought. If it be conceded that the
   Bible contains truth, it is only so far as it coincides with the
   teachings of philosophy. The same concession is freely made concerning
   the writings of the heathen sages. The theology of Daub, for example,
   is nothing more than the philosophy of Schelling. That is, it teaches
   just what that philosophy teaches concerning God, man, sin, redemption,
   and the future state. Marheinecke and Strauss find Hegelianism in the
   Bible, and they therefore admit that so far the Bible teaches truth.
   Rosenkranz, a philosopher of the same school, says Christianity is the
   absolute religion, because its fundamental principle, namely, the
   oneness of God and man, is the fundamental principle of his philosophy.
   In his "Encyklopädie" (p. 3) he says: "The only religion which conforms
   to reason is Christianity, because it regards man as the form in which
   God has revealed himself. Its theology is therefore anthropology, and
   its anthropology is theology. The idea of (Gottmenschheit) the godhead
   of man, is the key of Christianity, in which as Lessing says, lies its
   rationality."

   These are the principal forms of the speculative method in its
   application to theology. These topics will present themselves for
   fuller consideration in a subsequent chapter.

   § 4. The Mystical Method.

   Few words have been used with greater latitude of meaning than
   mysticism. It is here to be taken in a sense antithetical to
   speculation. Speculation is a process of thought; mysticism is matter
   of feeling. The one assumes that the thinking faculty is that by which
   we attain the knowledge of truth. The other, distrusting reason,
   teaches that the feelings alone are to be relied upon, at least in the
   sphere of religion. Although this method has been unduly pressed, and
   systems of theology have been constructed under its guidance, which are
   either entirely independent of the Scriptures, or in which the
   doctrines of the Bible have been modified and perverted, it is not to
   be denied that great authority is due to our moral nature in matters of
   religion. It has ever been a great evil in the Church that men have
   allowed the logical understanding, or what they call their reason, to
   lead them to conclusions which are not only contrary to Scripture, but
   which do violence to our moral nature. It is conceded that nothing
   contrary to reason can be true. But it is no less important to remember
   that nothing contrary to our moral nature can be true. It is also to be
   admitted that conscience is much less liable to err than reason; and
   when they come into conflict, real or apparent, our moral nature is the
   stronger, and will assert its authority in spite of all we can do. It
   is rightfully supreme in the soul, although, with the reason and the
   will, it is in absolute subjection to God, who is infinite reason and
   infinite moral excellence.

   Mysticism as applied to Theology.

   Mysticism, in its application to theology, has assumed two principal
   forms, the supernatural and the natural. According to the former, God,
   or the Spirit of God, holds direct communion with the soul; and by the
   excitement of its religious feelings gives it intuitions of truth, and
   enables it to attain a kind, a degree, and an extent of knowledge,
   unattainable in any other way. This has been the common theory of
   Christian mystics in ancient and modern times. If by this were meant
   merely that the Spirit of God, by his illuminating influence, gives
   believers a knowledge of the truths objectively revealed in the
   Scriptures, which is peculiar, certain, and saving, it would be
   admitted by all evangelical Christians. And it is because such
   Christians do hold to this inward teaching of the Spirit, that they are
   often called Mystics by their opponents. This, however, is not what is
   here meant. The mystical method, in its supernatural form, assumes that
   God by his immediate intercourse with the soul, reveals through the
   Feelings and by means, or in the way of intuitions, divine truth
   independently of the outward teaching of his Word; and that it is this
   inward light, and not the Scriptures, which we are to follow.

   According to the other, or natural form of the mystical method, it is
   not God, but the natural religious consciousness of men, as excited and
   influenced by the circumstances of the individual, which becomes the
   source of religious knowledge. The deeper and purer the religious
   feelings, the clearer the insight into truth. This illumination or
   spiritual intuition is a matter of degree. But as all men have a
   religious nature, they all have more or less clearly the apprehension
   of religious truth. The religious consciousness of men in different
   ages and nations, has been historically developed under diverse
   influences, and hence we have diverse forms of religion, -- the Pagan,
   the Mohammedan, and the Christian. These do not stand related as true
   and false, but as more or less pure. The appearance of Christ, his
   life, his work, his words, his death, had a wonderful effect on the
   minds of men. Their religious feelings were more deeply stirred, were
   more purified and elevated than ever before. Hence the men of his
   generation, who gave themselves up to his influence, had intuitions of
   religious truth of a far higher order than mankind had before attained.
   This influence continues to the present time. All Christians are its
   subjects. All, therefore, in proportion to the purity and elevation of
   their religious feelings, have intuitions of divine things, such as the
   Apostles and other Christians enjoyed. Perfect holiness would secure
   perfect knowledge.

   Consequences of the Mystical Method.

   It follows from this theory, -- (1.) That there are no such things as
   revelation and inspiration, in the established theological meaning of
   those terms. Revelation is the supernatural objective presentation or
   communication of truth to the mind, by the Spirit of God. But according
   to this theory there is, and can be, no such communication of truth.
   The religious feelings are providentially excited, and by reason of
   that excitement the mind perceives truth more or less clearly, or more
   or less imperfectly. Inspiration, in the Scriptural sense, is the
   supernatural guidance of the Spirit, which renders its subjects
   infallible in the communicating truth to others. But according to this
   theory, no man is infallible as a teacher. Revelation and inspiration
   are in different degrees common to all men. And there is no reason why
   they should not be as perfect in some believers now as in the days of
   the Apostles. (2.) The Bible has no infallible authority in matters of
   doctrine. The doctrinal propositions therein contained are not
   revelations by the Spirit. They are only the forms under which men of
   Jewish culture gave expression to their feelings and intuitions. Men of
   different culture, and under other circumstances, would have used other
   forms or adopted other doctrinal statements. (3.) Christianity
   therefore, neither consists in a system of doctrines, nor does it
   contain any such system. It is a life, an influence, a subjective
   state; or by whatever term it may be expressed or explained, it is a
   power within each individual Christian determining his feelings and his
   views of divine things. (4.) Consequently the duty of a theologian is
   not to interpret Scripture, but to interpret his own Christian
   consciousness; to ascertain and exhibit what truths concerning God are
   implied in his feelings toward God; what truths concerning Christ are
   involved in his feelings toward Christ; what the feelings teach
   concerning sin, redemption, eternal life, etc., etc.

   This method found its most distinguished and influential advocate in
   Schleiermacher, whose "Glaubenslehre" is constructed on this principle.
   By Twesten -- his successor in the chair of Theology in the University
   of Berlin -- it is held in greater subjection to the normal authority
   of Scripture. By others, again, of the same school, it has been carried
   out to its utmost extreme. We are at present, however, concerned only
   with its principle, and neither with the details of its application,
   nor with its refutation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 5. The Inductive Method.

   It is so called because it agrees in everything essential with the
   inductive method as applied to the natural sciences.

   First, The man of science comes to the study of nature with certain
   assumptions. (1.) He assumes the trustworthiness of his sense
   perceptions. Unless he can rely upon the well-authenticated testimony
   of his senses, he is deprived of all means of prosecuting his
   investigations. The facts of nature reveal themselves to our faculties
   of sense, and can be known in no other way. (2.) He must also assume
   the trustworthiness of his mental operations. He must take for granted
   that he can perceive, compare, combine, remember, and infer; and that
   he can safely rely upon these mental faculties in their legitimate
   exercise. (3.) He must also rely on the certainty of those truths which
   are not learned from experience, but which are given in the
   constitution of our nature. That every effect must have a cause; that
   the same cause under like circumstances, will produce like effects;
   that a cause is not a mere uniform antecedent, but that which contains
   within itself the reason why the effect occurs.

   Second, The student of nature having this ground on which to stand, and
   these tools wherewith to work, proceeds to perceive, gather, and
   combine his facts. These he does not pretend to manufacture, nor
   presume to modify. He must take them as they are. He is only careful to
   be sure that they are real, and that he has them all, or, at least all
   that are necessary to justify any inference which he may draw from
   them, or any theory which he may build upon them.

   Third, From facts thus ascertained and classified, he deduces the laws
   by which they are determined. That a heavy body falls to the ground is
   a familiar fact. Observation shows that it is not an isolated fact; but
   that all matter tends toward all other matter, that this tendency or
   attraction is in proportion to the quantity of matter; and its
   intensity decreases in proportion to the square of the distance of the
   attracting bodies. As all this is found to be universally and
   constantly the case within the field of observation, the mind is forced
   to conclude that there is some reason for it; in other words, that it
   is a law of nature which may be relied upon beyond the limits of actual
   observation. As this law has always operated in the past, the man of
   science is sure that it will operate in the future. It is in this way
   the vast body of modern science has been built up, and the laws which
   determine the motions of the heavenly bodies; the chemical changes
   constantly going on around us; the structure, growth, and propagation
   of plants and animals, have, to a greater or less extent, been
   ascertained and established. It is to be observed that these laws or
   general principles are not derived from the mind, and attributed to
   external objects, but derived or deduced from the objects and impressed
   upon the mind.

   A. The Inductive Method as applied to Theology.

   The Bible is to the theologian what nature is to the man of science. It
   is his store-house of facts; and his method of ascertaining what the
   Bible teaches, is the same as that which the natural philosopher adopts
   to ascertain what nature teaches. In the first place, he comes to his
   task with all the assumptions above mentioned. He must assume the
   validity of those laws of belief which God has impressed upon our
   nature. In these laws are included some which have no direct
   application to the natural sciences. Such, for example, as the
   essential distinction between right and wrong; that nothing contrary to
   virtue can be enjoined by God; that it cannot be right to do evil that
   good may come; that sin deserves punishment, and other similar first
   truths, which God has implanted in the constitution of all moral
   beings, and which no objective revelation can possibly contradict.
   These first principles, however, are not to be arbitrarily assumed. No
   man has a right to lay down his own opinions, however firmly held, and
   call them "first truths of reason," and make them the source or test of
   Christian doctrines. Nothing can rightfully be included under the
   category of first truths, or laws of belief, which cannot stand the
   tests of universality and necessity, to which many add self-evidence.
   But self-evidence is included in universality and necessity, in so far,
   that nothing which is not self-evident can be universally believed, and
   what is self-evident forces itself on the mind of every intelligent
   creature.

   Facts to be collected.

   In the second place, the duty of the Christian theologian is to
   ascertain, collect, and combine all the facts which God has revealed
   concerning himself and our relation to Him. These facts are all in the
   Bible. This is true, because everything revealed in nature, and in the
   constitution of man concerning God and our relation to Him, is
   contained and authenticated in Scripture. It is in this sense that "the
   Bible, and the Bible alone, is the religion of Protestants." It may be
   admitted that the truths which the theologian has to reduce to a
   science, or, to speak more humbly, which he has to arrange and
   harmonize, are revealed partly in the external works of God, partly in
   the constitution of our nature, and partly in the religious experience
   of believers; yet lest we should err in our inferences from the works
   of God, we have a clearer revelation of all that nature reveals, in his
   word; and lest we should misinterpret our own consciousness and the
   laws of our nature, everything that can be legitimately learned from
   that source will be found recognized and authenticated in the
   Scriptures; and lest we should attribute to the teaching of the Spirit
   the operations of our own natural affections, we find in the Bible the
   norm and standard of all genuine religious experience. The Scriptures
   teach not only the truth, but what are the effects of the truth on the
   heart and conscience, when applied with saving power by the Holy Ghost.

   The Theologian to be guided by the same rules as the Man of Science.

   In the third place, the theologian must be guided by the same rules in
   the collection of facts, as govern the man of science.

   1. This collection must be made with diligence and care. It is not an
   easy work. There is in every department of investigation great
   liability to error. Almost all false theories in science and false
   doctrines in theology are due in a great degree to mistakes as to
   matters of fact. A distinguished naturalist said he repeated an
   experiment a thousand times before he felt authorized to announce the
   result to the scientific world as an established fact.

   2. This collection of facts must not only be carefully conducted, but
   also comprehensive, and if possible, exhaustive. An imperfect induction
   of facts led men for ages to believe that the sun moved round the
   earth, and that the earth was an extended plain. In theology a partial
   induction of particulars has led to like serious errors. It is a fact
   that the Scriptures attribute omniscience to Christ. From this it was
   inferred that He could not have had a finite intelligence, but that the
   Logos was clothed in Him with a human body with its animal life. But it
   is also a Scriptural fact that ignorance and intellectual progress, as
   well as omniscience, are ascribed to our Lord. Both facts, therefore,
   must be included in our doctrine of his person. We must admit that He
   had a human, as well as a divine intelligence. It is a fact that
   everything that can be predicated of a sinless man, is in the Bible,
   predicated of Christ; and it is also a fact that everything that is
   predicated of God is predicated of our Lord; hence it has been inferred
   that there were two Christs, --two persons, -- the one human, the other
   divine, and that they dwelt together very much as the Spirit dwells in
   the believer; or, as evil spirits dwelt in demoniacs. But this theory
   overlooked the numerous facts which prove the individual personality of
   Christ. It was the same person who said, "I thirst;" who said, "Before
   Abraham was I am." The Scriptures teach that Christ's death was
   designed to reveal the love of God, and to secure the reformation of
   men. Hence Socinus denied that his death was an expiation for sin, or
   satisfaction of justice. The latter fact, however, is as clearly
   revealed as the former; and therefore both must be taken into account
   in our statement of the doctrine concerning the design of Christ's
   death.

   Necessity of a complete Induction.

   Illustrations without end might be given of the necessity of a
   comprehensive induction of facts to justify our doctrinal conclusions.
   These facts must not be willfully denied or carelessly overlooked, or
   unfairly appreciated. We must be honest here, as the true student of
   nature is honest in his induction. Even scientific men are sometimes
   led to suppress or to pervert facts which militate against their
   favorite theories; but the temptation to this form of dishonesty is far
   less in their case, than in that of the theologian. The truths of
   religion are far more important than those of natural science. They
   come home to the heart and conscience. They may alarm the fears or
   threaten the hopes of men, so that they are under strong temptation to
   overlook or pervert them. If, however, we really desire to know what
   God has revealed we must be conscientiously diligent and faithful in
   collecting the facts which He has made known, and in giving them their
   due weight. If a geologist should find in a deposit of early date
   implements of human workmanship, he is not allowed to say they are
   natural productions. He must either revise his conclusion as to the age
   of the deposit, or carry back to an earlier period the existence of
   man. There is no help for it. Science cannot make facts; it must take
   them as they are. In like manner, if the Bible asserts that Christ's
   death was a satisfaction to justice, the theologian is not allowed to
   merge justice into benevolence in order to suit his theory of the
   atonement. If the Scriptures teach that men are born in sin, we cannot
   change the nature of sin, and make it a tendency to evil and not really
   sin, in order to get rid of difficulty. If it be a Scriptural fact that
   the soul exists in a state of conscious activity between death and the
   resurrection, we must not deny this fact or reduce this conscious
   activity to zero, because our anthropology teaches that the soul has no
   individuality and no activity without a body. We must take the facts of
   the Bible as they are, and construct our system so as to embrace them
   all in their integrity.

   Principles to be deduced from facts.

   In the fourth place, in theology as in natural science, principles are
   derived from facts, and not impressed upon them. The properties of
   matter, the laws of motion, of magnetism, of light. etc., are not
   framed by the mind. They are not laws of thought. They are deductions
   from facts. The investigator sees, or ascertains by observation, what
   are the laws which determine material phenomena; he does not invent
   those laws. His speculations on matters of science unless sustained by
   facts, are worthless. It is no less unscientific for the theologian to
   assume a theory as to the nature of virtue, of sin, of liberty, of
   moral obligation, and then explain the facts of Scripture in accordance
   with his theories. His only proper course is to derive his theory of
   virtue, of sin, of liberty, of obligation, from the facts of the Bible.
   He should remember that his business is not to set forth his system of
   truth (that is of no account), but to ascertain and exhibit what is
   God's system, which is a matter of the greatest moment. If he cannot
   believe what the facts of the Bible assume to be true, let him say so.
   Let the sacred writers have their doctrine, while he has his own. To
   this ground a large class of modern exegetes and theologians, after a
   long struggle, have actually come. They give what they regard as the
   doctrines of the Old Testament; then those of the Evangelists: then
   those of the Apostles; and then their own. This is fair. So long,
   however, as the binding authority of Scripture is acknowledged, the
   temptation is very strong to press the facts of the Bible into
   accordance with our preconceived theories. If a man be persuaded that
   certainty in acting is inconsistent with liberty of action; that a free
   agent can always act contrary to any amount of influence (not
   destructive of his liberty) brought to bear upon him, he will
   inevitably deny that the Scriptures teach the contrary, and thus be
   forced to explain away all facts which prove the absolute control of
   God over the will and volitions of men. If he hold that sinfulness can
   be predicated only of intelligent, voluntary action in contravention of
   law, he must deny that men are born in sin, let the Bible teach what it
   may. If he believes that ability limits obligation, he must believe
   independently of the Scriptures, or in opposition to them, it matters
   not which, that men are able to repent, believe, love God perfectly, to
   live without sin, at any, and all times, without the least assistance
   from the Spirit of God. If he deny that the innocent may justly suffer
   penal evil for the guilty, he must deny that Christ bore our sins. If
   he deny that the merit of one man can be the judicial ground of the
   pardon and salvation of other men, he must reject the Scriptural
   doctrine of justification. It is plain that complete havoc must be made
   of the whole system of revealed truth, unless we consent to derive our
   philosophy from the Bible, instead of explaining the Bible by our
   philosophy. If the Scriptures teach that sin is hereditary, we must
   adopt a theory of sin suited to that fact. If they teach that men
   cannot repent, believe, or do anything spiritually good, without the
   supernatural aid of the Holy Spirit, we must make our theory of moral
   obligation accord with that fact. If the Bible teaches that we bear the
   guilt of Adam's first sin, that Christ bore our guilt, and endured the
   penalty of the law in our stead, these are facts with which we must
   make our principles agree. It would be easy to show that in every
   department of theology, -- in regard to the nature of God, his relation
   to the world, the plan of salvation, the person and work of Christ, the
   nature of sin, the operations of divine grace, men, instead of taking
   the facts of the Bible, and seeing what principles they imply, what
   philosophy underlies them, have adopted their philosophy independently
   of the Bible, to which the facts of the Bible are made to bend. This is
   utterly unphilosophical. It is the fundamental principle of all
   sciences, and of theology among the rest, that theory is to be
   determined by facts, and not facts by theory. As natural science was a
   chaos until the principle of induction was admitted and faithfully
   carried out, so theology is a jumble of human speculations, not worth a
   straw, when men refuse to apply the same principle to the study of the
   Word of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 6. The Scriptures contain all the Facts of Theology.

   This is perfectly consistent, on the one hand, with the admission of
   intuitive truths, both intellectual and moral, due to our constitution
   as rational and moral beings; and, on the other hand, with the
   controlling power over our beliefs exercised by the inward teachings of
   the Spirit, or, in other words, by our religious experience. And that
   for two reasons: First, All truth must be consistent. God cannot
   contradict himself. He cannot force us by the constitution of the
   nature which He has given us to believe one thing, and in his Word
   command us to believe the opposite. And second, All the truths taught
   by the constitution of our nature or by religious experience, are
   recognized and authenticated in the Scriptures. This is a safeguard and
   a limit. We cannot assume this or that principle to be intuitively
   true, or this or that conclusion to be demonstrably certain, and make
   them a standard to which the Bible must conform. What is self-evidently
   true, must be proved to be so, and is always recognized in the Bible as
   true. Whole systems of theologies are founded upon intuitions, so
   called, and if every man is at liberty to exalt his own intuitions, as
   men are accustomed to call their strong convictions, we should have as
   many theologies in the world as there are thinkers. The same remark is
   applicable to religious experience. There is no form of conviction more
   intimate and irresistible than that which arises from the inward
   teaching of the Spirit. All saving faith rests on his testimony or
   demonstrations (1 Cor. ii. 4). Believers have an unction from the Holy
   One, and they know the truth, and that no lie (or false doctrine) is of
   the truth. This inward teaching produces a conviction which no
   sophistries can obscure, and no arguments can shake. It is founded on
   consciousness, and you might as well argue a man out of a belief of his
   existence, as out of confidence that what he is thus taught of God is
   true. Two things, however, are to be borne in mind. First, That this
   inward teaching or demonstration of the Spirit is confined to truths
   objectively revealed in the Scriptures. It is given, says the Apostle,
   in order that we may know things gratuitously given, i.e., revealed to
   us by God in His Word (1 Cor. ii. 10-16). It is not, therefore, a
   revelation of new truths, but an illumination of the mind, so that it
   apprehends the truth, excellence, and glory of things already revealed.
   And second, This experience is depicted in the Word of God. The Bible
   gives us not only the facts concerning God, and Christ, ourselves, and
   our relations to our Maker and Redeemer, but also records the
   legitimate effects of those truths on the minds of believers. So that
   we cannot appeal to our own feelings or inward experience, as a ground
   or guide, unless we can show that it agrees with the experience of holy
   men as recorded in the Scriptures.

   The Teaching of the Spirit.

   Although the inward teaching of the Spirit, or religious experience, is
   no substitute for an external revelation, and is no part of the rule of
   faith, it is, nevertheless, an invaluable guide in determining what the
   rule of faith teaches. The distinguishing feature of Augustinianism as
   taught by Augustin himself, and by the purer theologians of the Latin
   Church throughout the Middle Ages, which was set forth by the
   Reformers, and especially by Calvin and the Geneva divines, is that the
   inward teaching of the Spirit is allowed its proper place in
   determining our theology. The question is not first and mainly, What is
   true to the understanding, but what is true to the renewed heart? The
   effort is not to make the assertions of the Bible harmonize with the
   speculative reason, but to subject our feeble reason to the mind of God
   as revealed in his Word, and by his Spirit in our inner life. It might
   be easy to lead men to the conclusion that they are responsible only
   for their voluntary acts, if the appeal is made solely to the
   understanding. But if the appeal be made to every man's, and especially
   to every Christian's inward experience, the opposite conclusion is
   reached. We are convinced of the sinfulness of states of mind as well
   as of voluntary acts, even when those states are not the effect of our
   own agency, and are not subject to the power of the will. We are
   conscious of being sold under sin; of being its slaves; of being
   possessed by it as a power or law, immanent, innate, and beyond our
   control. Such is the doctrine of the Bible, and such is the teaching of
   our religious consciousness when under the influence of the Spirit of
   God. The true method in theology requires that the facts of religious
   experience should be accepted as facts, and when duly authenticated by
   Scripture, be allowed to interpret the doctrinal statements of the Word
   of God. So legitimate and powerful is this inward teaching of the
   Spirit, that it is no uncommon thing to find men having two theologies,
   -- one of the intellect, and another of the heart. The one may find
   expression in creeds and systems of divinity, the other in their
   prayers and hymns. It would be safe for a man to resolve to admit into
   his theology nothing which is not sustained by the devotional writings
   of true Christians of every denomination. It would be easy to construct
   from such writings, received and sanctioned by Romanists, Lutherans,
   Reformed, and Remonstrants, a system of Pauline or Augustinian
   theology, such as would satisfy any intelligent and devout Calvinist in
   the world.

   The true method of theology is, therefore, the inductive, which assumes
   that the Bible contains all the facts or truths which form the contents
   of theology, just as the facts of nature are the contents of the
   natural sciences. It is also assumed that the relation of these
   Biblical facts to each other, the principles involved in them, the laws
   which determine them, are in the facts themselves, and are to be
   deduced from them, just as the laws of nature are deduced from the
   facts of nature. In neither case are the principles derived from the
   mind and imposed upon the facts, but equally in both departments, the
   principles or laws are deduced from the facts and recognized by the
   mind.

CHAPTER II.

  THEOLOGY
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Its Nature.

   If the views presented in the preceding chapter be correct, the
   question, What is Theology? is already answered. If natural science be
   concerned with the facts and laws of nature, theology is concerned with
   the facts and the principles of the Bible. If the object of the one be
   to arrange and systematize the facts of the external world, and to
   ascertain the laws by which they are determined; the object of the
   other is to systematize the facts of the Bible, and ascertain the
   principles or general truths which those facts involve. And as the
   order in which the facts of nature are arranged cannot be determined
   arbitrarily, but by the nature of the facts themselves, so it is with
   the facts of the Bible. The parts of any organic whole have a natural
   relation which cannot with impunity be ignored or changed. The parts of
   a watch, or of any other piece of mechanism, must be normally arranged,
   or it will be in confusion and worthless. All the parts of a plant or
   animal are disposed to answer a given end, and are mutually dependent.
   We cannot put the roots of a tree in the place of the branches, or the
   teeth of an animal in the place of its feet. So the facts of science
   arrange themselves. They are not arranged by the naturalist. His
   business is simply to ascertain what the arrangement given in the
   nature of the facts is. If he mistake, his system is false, and to a
   greater or less degree valueless. The same is obviously true with
   regard to the facts or truths of the Bible. They cannot be held in
   isolation, nor will they admit of any and every arrangement the
   theologian may choose to assign them. They bear a natural relation to
   each other, which cannot be overlooked or perverted without the facts
   themselves being perverted. If the facts of Scripture are what
   Augustinians believe them to be, then the Augustinian system is the
   only possible system of theology. If those facts be what Romanists or
   Remonstrants take them to be, then their system is the only true one.
   It is important that the theologian should know his place. He is not
   master of the situation. He can no more construct a system of theology
   to suit his fancy than the astronomer can adjust the mechanism of the
   heavens according to his own good pleasure. As the facts of astronomy
   arrange themselves in a certain order, and will admit of no other, so
   it is with the facts of theology. Theology, therefore, is the
   exhibition of the facts of Scripture in their proper order and
   relation, with the principles or general truths involved in the facts
   themselves, and which pervade and harmonize the whole.

   It follows, also, from this view of the subject, that as the Bible
   contains one class of facts or truths which are not elsewhere revealed,
   and another class which, although more clearly made known in the
   Scriptures than anywhere else, are, nevertheless, so far revealed in
   nature as to be deducible therefrom, theology is properly distinguished
   as natural and revealed. The former is concerned with the facts of
   nature so far as they reveal God and our relation to him, and the
   latter with the facts of Scripture. This distinction, which, in one
   view is important, in another, is of little consequence, inasmuch as
   all that nature teaches concerning God and our duties, is more fully
   and more authoritatively revealed in his Word.

   Definitions of Theology.

   Other definitions of Theology are often given

   1. Sometimes the word is restricted to its etymological meaning, "a
   discourse concerning God." Orpheus and Homer were called theologians
   among the Greeks, because their poems treated of the nature of the
   gods. Aristotle classed the sciences under the heads of physics,
   mathematics, and theology, i.e., those which concern nature, number and
   quantity, and that which concerns God. The Fathers spoke of the Apostle
   John as the theologian, because in his gospel and epistles the divinity
   of Christ is rendered so prominent. The word is still used in this
   restricted sense when opposed to anthropology, soteriology,
   ecclesiology, as departments of theology in its wider sense.

   2. Theology is sometimes said to be the science of the supernatural.
   But what is the supernatural? The answer to that question depends on
   the meaning assigned to the word nature. If by nature is meant the
   external world as governed by fixed laws, then the souls of men and
   other spiritual beings are not included under the term. In this use of
   the word nature, the supernatural is synonymous with the spiritual, and
   theology, as the science of the supernatural, is synonymous with
   pneumatology. If this view be adopted, psychology becomes a branch of
   theology, and the theologian must, as such, teach mental philosophy.

   The word nature is, however, often taken in a wider sense, so as to
   include man. Then we have a natural and a spiritual world. And the
   supernatural is that which transcends nature in this sense, so that
   what is supernatural is of necessity also superhuman. But it is not
   necessarily super-angelic. Again, nature may mean everything out of
   God; then the supernatural is the divine, and God is the only
   legitimate subject of theology. In no sense of the word, therefore, is
   theology the science of the supernatural. Hooker [2] says, "Theology is
   the science of divine things." If by divine things, or "the things of
   God," he meant the things which concern God, then theology is
   restricted to a "discourse concerning God;" if he meant the things
   revealed by God, according to the analogy of the expression "things of
   the Spirit," as used by the Apostle in 1 Cor. ii. 14, then the
   definition amounts to the more definite one given above.

   3. A much more common definition of Theology, especially in our day, is
   that it is the science of religion. The word religion, however, is
   ambiguous. Its etymology is doubtful. Cicero [3] refers it to relegere,
   to go over again, to consider. "Religio" is then consideration, devout
   observance, especially of what pertains to the worship and service of
   God. "Religens" is devout, conscientious. "Religiosus," in a good
   sense, is the same as our word religious; in a bad sense, it means
   scrupulous, superstitious. "Religentem esse oportet, religiosum nefas."
   [4] Augustin and Lactantius derive the word from religare, to bind
   back. Augustin [5] says: "Ipse Deus enim fons nostræ beatudinis, ipse
   omnis appetitionis est finis. Hunc eligentes vel potius religentes
   amiseramus enim negligentes: hunc ergo religentes, unde et religio
   dicta perhibetur, ad eum dilectione tendimus ut perveniendo
   quiescamus." And Lactantius, "Vinculo pietatis obstricti, Deo religati
   sumus, unde ipsa religio nomen accepit, non, ut Cicero interpretatus
   est, a religendo." [6] According to this religio is the ground of
   obligation. It is that which binds us to God. Subjectively, it is the
   inward necessity of union with God. Commonly the word religion, in its
   objective sense, means "Modus Deum colendi," as when we speak of the
   Pagan, the Mohammedan, or the Christian religion. Subjectively, it
   expresses a state of mind. What that state characteristically is, is
   very variously stated. Most simply it is said to be the state of mind
   induced by faith in God, and a due sense of our relation to him. Or as
   Wegscheider expresses it, "Æqualis et constans animi affectio, qua
   homo, necessitudinem suam eandemque æternam, quæ ei cum summo omnium
   rerum auctore ac moderatore sanctissimo intercedit, intimo sensu
   complexus, cogitationes, voluntates et actiones suas ad eum referre
   studet." Or, as more concisely expressed by Bretschneider, "Faith in
   the reality of God, with a state of mind and mode of life in accordance
   with that faith." Or, more vaguely, "Recognition of the mutual relation
   between God and the world" (Fischer), or, "The recognition of a
   superhuman causality in the human soul and life" (Theile). "Faith
   founded on feeling in the reality of the ideal" (Jacobi). "The feeling
   of absolute dependence" (Schleiermacher). "The observance of the moral
   law as a divine institution" (Kant). "Faith in the moral order of the
   universe" (Fichte). "The union of the finite with the infinite or God's
   coming to self-consciousness in the world" (Schelling). [7]

   This diversity of views as to what religion is, is enough to prove how
   utterly vague and unsatisfactory must be the definition of theology as
   "the science of religion." Besides, this definition makes theology
   entirely independent of the Bible. For, as moral philosophy is the
   analysis of our moral nature, and the conclusions to which that
   analysis leads, so theology becomes the analysis of our religious
   consciousness, together with the truths which that analysis evolves.
   And even Christian theology is only the analysis of the religious
   consciousness of the Christian; and the Christian consciousness is not
   the natural religious consciousness of men as modified and determined
   by the truths of the Christian Scriptures, but it is something
   different. Some say it is to be referred to a new life transmitted from
   Christ. Others refer everything distinctive in the religious state of
   Christians to the Church, and really merge theology into ecclesiology.

   We have, therefore, to restrict theology to its true sphere, as the
   science of the facts of divine revelation so far as those facts concern
   the nature of God and our relation to him, as his creatures, as
   sinners, and as the subjects of redemption. All these facts, as just
   remarked, are in the Bible. But as some of them are revealed by the
   works of God, and by the nature of man, there is so far a distinction
   between natural theology, and theology considered distinctively as a
   Christian science.

   With regard to natural theology, there are two extreme opinions. The
   one is that the works of nature make no trustworthy revelation of the
   being and perfections of God; the other, that such revelation is so
   clear and comprehensive as to preclude the necessity of any
   supernatural revelation.

   § 2. The Facts of Nature Reveal God.

   Those who deny that natural theology teaches anything reliable
   concerning God, commonly understand by nature the external, material
   universe. They pronounce the ontological and teleological arguments
   derived from the existence of the world, and from the evidences of
   design which it contains, to be unsatisfactory. The fact that the world
   is, is a proof that it always has been, in the absence of all evidence
   to the contrary. And the argument from design, it is said, overlooks
   the difference between dead mechanism and a living organism, between
   manufacture and growth. That a locomotive cannot make itself, is no
   proof that a tree cannot grow. The one is formed ab extra by putting
   its dead parts together; the other is developed by a living principle
   within. The one necessitates the assumption of a maker external and
   anterior to itself, the other excludes, as is said, such assumption.
   Besides, it is urged that religious truths do not admit of proof. They
   belong to the same category with aesthetic and moral truths. They are
   the objects of intuition. To be perceived at all, they must be
   perceived in their own light. You cannot prove a thing to be beautiful
   or good to the man who does not perceive its beauty or excellence.
   Hence, it is further urged, that proof of religious truth is
   unnecessary. The good do not need proof; the evil cannot appreciate it.
   All that can be done is to affirm the truth, and let it awaken, if
   possible, the dormant power of perception.

   A. Answer to the above Arguments.

   All this is sophistical. For the arguments in support of the truths of
   natural religion are not drawn exclusively from the external works of
   God. Those which are the most obvious and the most effective are
   derived from the constitution of our own nature. Man was made in the
   image of God, and he reveals his parentage as unmistakably as any class
   of inferior animals reveal the source from which they sprung. If a
   horse is born of a horse, the immortal spirit of man, instinct with its
   moral and religious convictions and aspirations, must be the offspring
   of the Father of Spirits. This is the argument which Paul on Mars' Hill
   addressed to the cavilling philosophers of Athens. That the sphere of
   natural theology is not merely the facts of the material universe is
   plain from the meaning of the word nature, which, as we have seen, has
   many legitimate senses. It is not only used to designate the external
   world, but also for the Forces active in the material universe, as when
   we speak of the operations and laws of nature, sometimes for all that
   falls into the chain of cause and effect as distinguished from the acts
   of free agents; and, as natura is derived from nascor, nature means
   whatever is produced, and therefore includes everything out of God, so
   that God and nature include all that is.

   2. The second objection to natural theology is that its arguments are
   inconclusive. This is a point which no man can decide for other men.
   Every one must judge for himself. An argument which is conclusive for
   one mind may be powerless for other minds. That the material universe
   began to be; that it has not the cause of its existence within itself,
   and therefore must have had an extramundane cause; and that the
   infinitely numerous manifestations of design which it exhibits show
   that that cause must be intelligent, are arguments for the being of
   God, which have satisfied the minds of the great body of intelligent
   men in all ages of the world. They should not, therefore, be dismissed
   as unsatisfactory, because all men do not feel their force. Besides, as
   just remarked, these arguments are only confirmatory of others more
   direct and powerful derived from our moral and religious nature.

   3. As to the objection that religious truths are the objects of
   intuition, and that intuitive truths neither need nor admit of proof,
   it may be answered that in one sense it is true. But self-evident
   truths may be illustrated; and it may be shown that their denial
   involves contradictions and absurdities. All geometry is an
   illustration of the axioms of Euclid; and if any man denies any of
   those axioms, it may be shown that he must believe impossibilities. In
   like manner, it may be admitted that the existence of a being on whom
   we are dependent, and to whom we are responsible, is a matter of
   intuition; and it may be acknowledged that it is self-evident that we
   can be responsible only to a person, and yet the existence of a
   personal God may be shown to be a necessary hypothesis to account for
   the facts of observation and consciousness, and that the denial of his
   existence leaves the problem of the universe unsolved and unsolvable.
   In other words, it may be shown that atheism, polytheism, and pantheism
   involve absolute impossibilities. This is a valid mode of proving that
   God is, although if be admitted that his existence after all is a
   self-evident truth. Theism is not the only self-evident truth that men
   are wont to deny.

   B. Scriptural Argument for Natural Theology.

   The Scriptures clearly recognize the fact that the works of God reveal
   his being and attributes. This they do not only by frequent reference
   to the works of nature as manifestations of the perfections of God, but
   by direct assertions. "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the
   firmament sheweth his handy-work. Day unto day uttereth speech, and
   night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language,
   where their voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the
   earth, and their words to the end of the world." (Ps. xix. 1-4.) "The
   idea of perpetual testimony," says Dr. Addison Alexander, [8] "is
   conveyed by the figure of one day and night following another as
   witnesses in unbroken succession. . . . . The absence of articulate
   language, far from weakening the testimony, makes it stronger. Even
   without speech or words, the heavens testify of God to all men."

   The sacred writers in contending with the heathen appeal to the
   evidence which the works of God bear to his perfections: "Understand,
   ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise? He
   that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall
   he not see? He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? He
   that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?" (Ps. xciv. 8-10.) Paul
   said to the men of Lystra, "Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are
   men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn
   from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven and earth,
   and the sea, and all things that are therein: Who in times past
   suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. Nevertheless he left
   not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from
   heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and
   gladness." (Acts xiv. 15-17.) To the men of Athens he said: "God that
   made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven
   and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; neither is
   worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he
   giveth to all life and breath, and all things; and hath made of one
   blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and
   hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their
   habitation; that they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel
   after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us: for
   in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your
   own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.' Forasmuch then as
   we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is
   like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device."
   (Acts xvii. 24-29.)

   Not only the fact of this revelation, but its clearness is distinctly
   asserted by the Apostle: "That which may be known of God is manifest in
   them; for God hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of him
   from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by
   the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that
   they are without excuse: because that when they knew God, they
   glorified him not as God, neither were thankful." (Rom. i. 19-21.)

   It cannot, therefore, be reasonably doubted that not only the being of
   God, but also his eternal power and Godhead, are so revealed in his
   works, as to lay a stable foundation for natural theology. To the
   illustration of this subject many important works have been devoted, a
   few of which are the following: "Wolf de Theologia Naturali," "The
   Bridgewater Treatises," Butler's "Analogy," Paley's "Natural Theology."

   § 3. Insufficiency of Natural Theology.

   The second extreme opinion respecting Natural Theology is, that it
   precludes the necessity of a supernatural revelation. The question
   whether the knowledge of God derived from his works, be sufficient to
   lead fallen men to salvation, is answered affirmatively by
   Rationalists, but negatively by every historical branch of the
   Christian Church. On this point the Greek, the Latin, the Lutheran, and
   the Reformed Churches are unanimous. The two former are more exclusive
   than the two latter. The Greeks and Latins, in making the sacraments
   the only channels of saving grace, deny the possibility of the
   salvation of the unbaptized, whether in heathen or Christian lands.
   This principle is so essential to the Romish system as to be included
   in the very definition of the Church, as given by the authoritative
   writers of the Papal Church. That definition is so framed as to exclude
   from the hope of salvation not only all unbaptized infants and adults,
   but all, no matter however enlightened in the knowledge of the
   Scriptures, and however holy in heart and life, who do not acknowledge
   the supremacy of the bishop of Rome.

   The question as to the sufficiency of natural theology, or of the
   truths of reason, is to be answered on the authority of the Scriptures.
   No man can tell à priori what is necessary to salvation. Indeed, it is
   only by supernatural revelation that we know that any sinner can be
   saved. It is from the same source alone, we can know what are the
   conditions of salvation, or who are to be its subjects.

   A. What the Scriptures teach as to the Salvation of Men. Salvation of
   Infants.

   What the Scriptures teach on this subject, according to the common
   doctrine of evangelical Protestants is first: --

   1. All who die in infancy are saved. This is inferred from what the
   Bible teaches of the analogy between Adam and Christ. "As by the
   offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by
   the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto
   justification of life. For as by one man's disobedience many (hoi
   polloi = pantes) were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall
   many (hoi polloi = pantes) be made righteous." (Rom. v. 18, 19.) We
   have no right to put any limit on these general terms, except what the
   Bible itself places upon them. The Scriptures nowhere exclude any class
   of infants, baptized or unbaptized, born in Christian or in heathen
   lands, of believing or unbelieving parents, from the benefits of the
   redemption of Christ. All the descendants of Adam, except Christ, are
   under condemnation; all the descendants of Adam, except those of whom
   it is expressly revealed that they cannot inherit the kingdom of God,
   are saved. This appears to be the clear meaning of the Apostle, and
   therefore he does not hesitate to say that where sin abounded, grace
   has much more abounded, that the benefits of redemption far exceed the
   evils of the fall; that the number of the saved far exceeds the number
   of the lost.

   This is not inconsistent with the declaration of our Lord, in Matthew
   vii. 14, that only a few enter the gate which leadeth unto life. This
   is to be understood of adults. What the Bible says is intended for
   those in all ages, to whom it is addressed. But it is addressed to
   those who can either read or hear. It tells them what they are to
   believe and do. It would be an entire perversion of its meaning to make
   it apply to those to whom and of whom it does not speak. When it is
   said, "He that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath
   of God abideth on him" (John iii. 36), no one understands this to
   preclude the possibility of the salvation of infants.

   Not only, however, does the comparison, which the Apostle makes between
   Adam and Christ, lead to the conclusion that as all are condemned for
   the sin of the one, so all are saved by the righteousness of the other,
   those only excepted whom the Scriptures except; but the principle
   assumed throughout the whole discussion teaches the same doctrine. That
   principle is that it is more congenial with the nature of God to bless
   than to curse, to save than to destroy. If the race fell in Adam, much
   more shall it be restored in Christ. If death reigned by one, much more
   shall grace reign by one. This "much more" is repeated over and over.
   The Bible everywhere teaches that God delighteth not in the death of
   the wicked; that judgment is his strange work. It is, therefore,
   contrary not only to the argument of the Apostle, but to the whole
   spirit of the passage (Romans v. 12-21), to exclude infants from "the
   all" who are made alive in Christ.

   The conduct and language of our Lord in reference to children are not
   to be regarded as matters of sentiment, or simply expressive of kindly
   feeling. He evidently looked upon them as the lambs of the flock for
   which, as the good Shepherd, He laid down his life, and of whom He said
   they shall never perish, and no man could pluck them out of his hands.
   Of such He tells us is the kingdom of heaven, as though heaven was, in
   great measure, composed of the souls of redeemed infants. It is,
   therefore, the general belief of Protestants, contrary to the doctrine
   of Romanists and Romanizers, that all who die in infancy are saved.

   B. Rule of Judgment for Adults.

   2. Another general fact clearly revealed in Scripture is, that men are
   to be judged according to their works, and according to the light which
   they have severally enjoyed. God "will render to every man according to
   his deeds: to them who, by patient continuance in well doing, seek for
   glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life; but unto them that
   are contentious, and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness,
   indignation, and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man
   that doeth evil; of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; but glory,
   honour, and peace to every man that worketh good; to the Jew first, and
   also to the Gentile, for there is no respect of persons with God. For
   as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law, and
   as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law." (Rom ii.
   6-12.) Our Lord teaches that those who sinned with knowledge of God's
   will, shall be beaten with many stripes; and that those who sinned
   without such knowledge shall be beaten with few stripes; and that it
   will be more tolerable in the day of judgment for the heathen, even for
   Sodom and Gomorrah, than for those who perish under the light of the
   gospel. (Matt. x. 15; xi. 20-24.) The Judge of all the earth will do
   right. No human being will suffer more than he deserves, or more than
   his own conscience shall recognize as just.

   C. All Men under Condemnation.

   3. But the Bible tells us, that judged according to their works and
   according to the light which they have severally enjoyed, all men will
   be condemned. There is none righteous; no, not one. The whole world is
   guilty before God. This verdict is confirmed by every man's conscience.
   The consciousness of guilt and of moral pollution is absolutely
   universal.

   Here it is that natural theology utterly fails. It cannot answer the
   question, How can man be just with God? or, How can God be just and yet
   justify the ungodly? Mankind have anxiously pondered this question for
   ages, and have gained no satisfaction. The ear has been placed on the
   bosom of humanity, to catch the still, small voice of conscience, and
   got no answer. It has been directed heavenward, and received no
   response. Reason, conscience, tradition, history, unite in saying that
   sin is death; and, therefore, that so far as human wisdom and resources
   are concerned, the salvation of sinners is as impossible as raising the
   dead. Every conceivable method of expiation and purification has been
   tried without success.

   4. The Scriptures, therefore, teach that the heathen are "without
   Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers
   from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God." (Eph.
   ii. 12.) They are declared to be without excuse, "Because, that when
   they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful;
   but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was
   darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and
   changed the glory of the uncorruptible God, into an image made like
   unto corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and
   creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness,
   through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies
   between themselves: who changed the truth of God into a lie, and
   worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is
   blessed for ever. Amen." (Rom. i. 21-25.) The Apostle says of the
   Gentiles that they "walk in the vanity of their mind, having the
   understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through
   the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of thicir heart:
   who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lascivousness,
   to work all uncleanness with greediness." (Eph. iv. 17-19.)

   5. All men being sinners, justly chargeable with inexcusable impiety
   and immorality, they cannot be saved by any effort or resource of their
   own. For we are told that "the unrighteous shall not inherit the
   kingdom of God. Be not deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters,
   nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
   nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
   extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God." (1 Cor. vi. 9.) "For
   this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous
   man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ
   and of God." (Eph. v. 5.) More than this, the Bible teaches us that a
   man may be outwardly righteous in the sight of men, and yet be a
   whitened sepulchre, his heart being the seat of pride, envy, or malice.
   In other words, he may be moral in his conduct, and by reason of inward
   evil passions, be in the sight of God the chief of sinners, as was the
   case with Paul himself. And more even than this, although a man were
   free from outward sins, and, were it possible, from the sins of the
   heart, this negative goodness would not suffice. Without holiness "no
   man shall see the Lord." (Heb. xii. 14.) "Except a man be born again,
   he cannot see the kingdom of God." (John iii. 3.) "He that loveth not,
   knoweth not God." (1 John iv. 8.) "If any man love the world, the love
   of the Father is not in him." (1 John ii. 15.) "He that loveth father
   or mother more than me, is not worthy of me." (1 John iv. 8.) Who then
   can be saved? If the Bible excludes from the kingdom of heaven all the
   immoral; all whose hearts are corrupted by pride, envy, malice, or
   covetousness; all who love the world; all who are not holy; all in whom
   the love of God is not the supreme and controlling principle of action,
   it is evident that, so far as adults are concerned, salvation must be
   confined to very narrow limits. It is also evident that mere natural
   religion, the mere objective power of general religious truth, must be
   as inefficacious in preparing men for the presence of God, as the
   waters of Syria to heal the leprosy.

   D. The necessary Conditions of Salvation.

   6. Seeing then that the world by wisdom knows not God; seeing that men
   when left to themselves inevitably die in their sins; it has "pleased
   God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe." (1 Cor.
   i. 21.) God has sent his Son into the world to save sinners. Had any
   other method of salvation been possible, Christ is dead in vain. (Gal.
   ii. 21; iii. 21.) There is, therefore, no other name whereby men can be
   saved. (Acts iv. 12.) The knowledge of Christ and faith in Him are
   declared to be essential to salvation. This is proved: (1.) Because men
   are declared to be guilty before God. (2.) Because no man can expiate
   his own guilt and restore himself to the image of God. (3.) Because it
   is expressly declared that Christ is the only Saviour of men. (4.)
   Because Christ gave his Church the commission to preach the gospel to
   every creature under heaven, as the appointed means of salvation. (5.)
   Because the Apostles in the execution of this commission went
   everywhere preaching the Word, testifying to all men, Jews and
   Gentiles, to the wise and the unwise, that they must believe in Christ
   as the Son of God in order to be saved. Our Lord himself teaching
   through his forerunner said, "He that believeth on the Son hath
   everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life;
   but the wrath of God abideth on him." (John iii. 36.) (6.) Because
   faith without knowledge is declared to be impossible. "Whosoever shall
   call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call
   on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in
   him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a
   preacher? and how shall they preach, except they be sent?" (Rom. x.
   13-15.)

   It is, therefore, as before stated, the common faith of the Christian
   world, that, so far as adults are concerned, there is no salvation
   without the knowledge of Christ and faith in Him. This has ever been
   regarded as the ground of the obligation which rests upon the Church to
   preach the gospel to every creature.

   E. Objections.

   To the objection that this doctrine is inconsistent with the goodness
   and justice of God, it may be answered: (1.) That the doctrine only
   assumes what the objector, if a Theist, must admit, namely, that God
   will deal with men according to their character and conduct, and that
   He will judge them according to the light which they have severally
   enjoyed. It is because the judge of all the earth must do right that
   all sinners receive the wages of sin by an inexorable law, unless saved
   by the miracle of redemption. In teaching, therefore, that there is no
   salvation for those ignorant of the gospel the Bible only teaches that
   a just God will punish sin. (2.) The doctrine of the Church on this
   subject does not go beyond the facts of the case. It only teaches that
   God will do what we see He actually does. He leaves mankind, in a large
   measure, to themselves. He allows them to make themselves sinful and
   miserable. It is no more difficult to reconcile the doctrine than the
   undeniable fact with the goodness of our God. (3.) In the gift of his
   Son, the revelation of his Word, the mission of the Spirit, and the
   institution of the Church, God has made abundant provision for the
   salvation of the world. That the Church has been so remiss in making
   known the gospel is her guilt. We must not charge the ignorance and
   consequent perdition of the heathen upon God. The guilt rests on us. We
   have kept to ourselves the bread of life, and allowed the nations to
   perish.

   Some of the older Lutheran divines were disposed to meet the objection
   in question by saying that the plan of salvation was revealed to all
   mankind at three distinct epochs. First, immediately after the fall, to
   Adam; second, in the days of Noah; and third, during the age of the
   Apostles. If that knowledge has been lost it has been by the culpable
   ignorance of the heathen themselves. This is carrying the doctrine of
   imputation to its utmost length. It is making the present generation
   responsible for the apostasy of their ancestors. It leaves the
   difficulty just where it was.

   The Wesleyan Arminians and the Friends, admitting the insufficiency of
   the light of nature, hold that God gives sufficient grace, or an inward
   supernatural light, which, if properly cherished and followed, will
   lead men to salvation. But this is merely an amiable hypothesis. For
   such universal and sufficient grace there is no promise in the
   Scripture, and no evidence in experience. Besides, if admitted it does
   not help the matter. If this sufficient grace does not actually save,
   if it does not deliver the heathen from those sins upon which the
   judgment of God is denounced, it only aggravates their condemnation.
   All we can do is to adhere closely to the teachings of the Bible,
   assured that the Judge of all the earth will do right; that although
   clouds and darkness are round about Him, and his ways past finding out,
   justice and judgment are the habitation of his throne.

   § 4. Christian Theology.

   As science, concerned with the facts of nature, has its several
   departments, as Mathematics, Chemistry, Astronomy, etc., so Theology
   having the facts of Scripture for its subject, has its distinct and
   natural departments. First --

   Theology Proper,

   Which includes all the Bible teaches of the being and attributes of
   God; of the threefold personality of the Godhead, or, that the Father,
   Son, and Spirit are distinct persons, the same in substance and equal
   in power and glory; the relation of God to the world, or, his decrees
   and his works of Creation and Providence. Second, --

   Anthropology,

   Which includes the origin and nature of man; his original state and
   probation; his fall; the nature of sin; the effect of Adam's first sin
   upon himself and upon his posterity. Third, --

   Soteriology,

   Including the purpose or plan of God in reference to the salvation of
   man; the person and work of the Redeemer; the application of the
   redemption of Christ to the people of God, in their regeneration,
   justification, and sanctification; and the means of grace. Fourth, --

   Eschatology,

   That is, the doctrines which concern the state of the soul after death;
   the resurrection; the second advent of Christ; the general judgment and
   end of the world; heaven and hell. And fifth, --

   Ecclesiology,

   The idea, or nature of the Church; its attributes; its prerogatives;
   its organization.

   It is the suggestive remark of Kliefoth in his "Dogmengeschichte," that
   to the Greek mind and to the Greek Church, was assigned the task of
   elaborating the doctrine of the Bible concerning God, i.e., the
   doctrines of the Trinity and Person of Christ; to the Latin Church the
   doctrines concerning man; that is, of sin and grace; to the German
   Church, Soteriology, or the doctrine of justification. Ecclesiology, he
   says, is reserved for the future, as the doctrine concerning the Church
   has not been settled by oecumenical authority as have been the
   doctrines of Theology and Anthropology, and that of justification at
   least for the Protestant world.

   The above classification. although convenient and generally received,
   is far from being exhaustive. It leaves out of view the law (or at
   least subordinates it unduly), or rule of moral duty. This is a
   department in itself; and under the title of Moral Theology, is
   sometimes, as in the Latin Church, regarded as the most important.
   Among Protestants it is often regarded as a mere department of
   Philosophy.

   It has been assumed that Theology has to do with the facts or truths of
   the Bible; in other words, that the Scriptures of the Old and New
   Testaments are the only infallible rule of faith and practice. This,
   however, is not a conceded point. Same claim for Reason a paramount,
   or, at least a coordinate authority in matters of religion. Others
   assume an internal supernatural light to which they attribute
   paramount, or coordinate authority. Others rely on the authority of an
   infallible church. With Protestants, the Bible is the only infallible
   source of knowledge of divine things. It is necessary, therefore,
   before entering on our work, briefly to examine these several systems,
   namely, Rationalism, Mysticism, and Romanism.

CHAPTER III.

  RATIONALISM.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Meaning and Usage of the Word.

   By Rationalism is meant the system or theory which assigns undue
   authority to reason in matters of religion. By reason is not to be
   understood the Logos as revealed in man, as held by some of the
   Fathers, and by Cousin and other modern philosophers, nor the
   intuitional faculty as distinguished from the understanding or the
   discursive faculty. The word is taken in its ordinary sense for the
   cognitive faculty, that which perceives, compares, judges, and infers.

   Rationalism has appeared under different forms. (1.) The Deistical,
   which denies either the possibility or the fact of any supernatural
   revelation, and maintains that reason is both the source and ground of
   all religious knowledge and conviction. (2.) That which while it admits
   the possibility and the fact of a supernatural revelation, and that
   such a revelation is contained in the Christian Scriptures,
   nevertheless maintains that the truths revealed are the truths of
   reason; that is, truths which reason can comprehend and demonstrate.
   (3.) The third form of Rationalism has received the name of Dogmatism,
   which admits that many of the truths of revelation are undiscoverable
   by human reason, and that they are to be received upon authority.
   Nevertheless, it maintains that those truths when revealed admit of
   being philosophically explained and established and raised from the
   sphere of faith into that of knowledge.

   Rationalism in all its forms proceeds on the ground of Theism, that is,
   the belief of an extramundane personal God. When, therefore, Monism,
   which denies all dualism and affirms the identity of God and the world,
   took possession of the German mind, Rationalism, in its old form,
   disappeared. There was no longer any room for the distinction between
   reason and God, between the natural and the supernatural. No class of
   men, therefore, are more contemptuous in their opposition to the
   Rationalists, than the advocates of the modern, or, as it perhaps may
   be more properly designated, the modern pantheistic philosophy of
   Germany.

   Although in a measure banished from its recent home, it continues to
   prevail in all its forms, variously modified, both in Europe and
   America. Mansel, in his "Limits of Religious Thought," [9] includes
   under the head of Rationalism every system which makes the final test
   of truth to be "the direct assent of the human consciousness, whether
   in the form of logical deduction, or moral judgment, or religious
   intuition, by whatever previous process these faculties may have been
   raised to their assumed dignity as arbitrators." This, however, would
   include systems radically different in their nature.

   § 2. Deistical Rationalism.

   A. Possibility of a Supernatural Revelation.

   The first point to be determined in the controversy with the Deistical
   Rationalists, concerns the possibility of a supernatural revelation.
   This they commonly deny, either on philosophical or moral grounds. It
   is said to be inconsistent with the nature of God, and with his
   relation to the world, to suppose that He interferes by his direct
   agency in the course of events. The true theory of the universe,
   according to their doctrine, is that God having created the world and
   endowed his creatures with their attributes and properties, He has done
   all that is consistent with his nature. He does not interfere by his
   immediate agency in the production of effects. These belong to the
   efficiency of second causes. Or if the metaphysical possibility of such
   intervention be admitted, it is nevertheless morally impossible,
   because it would imply imperfection in God. If his work needs his
   constant interference it must be imperfect, and if imperfect, it must
   be that God is deficient either in wisdom or power.

   That this is a wrong theory of God's relation to the world is manifest.
   (1.) Because it contradicts the testimony of our moral nature. The
   relation in which we stand to God, as that relation reveals itself in
   our consciousness, implies that we are constantly in the presence of a
   God who takes cognizance of our acts, orders our circumstances, and
   interferes constantly for our correction or protection. He is not to us
   a God afar off, with whom we have no immediate concern; but a God who
   is not far from any one of us, in whom we live, move, and have our
   being, who numbers the hairs of our head, and without whose notice a
   sparrow does not fall to the ground. (2.) Reason itself teaches that
   the conception of God as a ruler of the world, having his creatures in
   his hands, able to control them at pleasure, and to hold communion with
   them, is a far higher conception and more consistent with the idea of
   infinite perfection, than that on which this system of Rationalism is
   founded. (3.) The common consciousness of men is opposed to this
   doctrine, as is plain from the fact that all nations, the most
   cultivated and the most barbarous, have been forced to conceive of God
   as a Being able to take cognizance of human affairs, and to reveal
   himself to his creatures. (4.) The argument from Scripture, although
   not admitted by Rationalists, is for Christians conclusive. The Bible
   reveals a God who is constantly and everywhere present with his works,
   and who acts upon them, not only mediately, but immediately, when,
   where, and how He sees fit.

   B. Necessity of a Supernatural Revelation.

   Admitting, however, the metaphysical possibility of a supernatural
   revelation, the next question is whether such a revelation is
   necessary. This question must be answered in the affirmative. (1.)
   Because every man feels that he needs it. He knows that there are
   questions concerning the origin, nature, and destiny of man; concerning
   sin, and the method in which it can be pardoned and conquered, which he
   cannot answer. They are questions, however, which must be answered. So
   long as these problems are unsolved, no man can be either good or
   happy. (2.) He is equally certain that no man answers these questions
   for his fellow-men. Every one sees intuitively that they relate to
   matters beyond the reach of human reason. What can reason decide as to
   the fate of the soul after death? Can he who has been unable to make
   himself holy or happy here, secure his own well-being in the eternal
   future? Every man, without a supernatural revelation, no matter how
   much of a philosopher, knows that death is the entrance on the unknown.
   It is the gate into darkness. Men must enter that gate conscious that
   they have within them an imperishable life combined with all the
   elements of perdition. Is it not self-evident then that immortal
   sinners need some one to answer with authority the question, What must
   I do to be saved? To convince a man that there is no sin, and that sin
   does not involve misery, is as impossible as to convince a wretch that
   he is not unhappy. The necessity of a divine revelation, therefore, is
   a simple matter of fact, of which every man is in his heart convinced.
   (3.) Admitting that philosophers could solve these great problems to
   their own satisfaction, What is to become of the mass of mankind? Are
   they to he left in darkness and despair? (4.) The experience of ages
   proves that the world by wisdom knows not God. The heathen nations,
   ancient and modern, civilized and savage, have without exception,
   failed by the light of nature to solve any of the great problems of
   humanity. This is the testimony of history as well as of Scripture.
   (5.) Even where the light of revelation is enjoyed, it is found that
   those who reject its guidance, are led not only to the most
   contradictory conclusions, but to the adoption of principles, in most
   cases, destructive of domestic virtue, social order, and individual
   worth and happiness. The reason of man has led the great body of those
   who know no other guide, into what has been well called, "The Hell of
   Pantheism."

   C. The Scriptures contain such a Revelation.

   Admitting the possibility and even the necessity of a supernatural
   revelation, Has such a revelation been actually made? This the
   Deistical Rationalist denies, and the Christian affirms. He confidently
   refers to the Bible as containing such a revelation, and maintains that
   its claims are authenticated by an amount of evidence which renders
   unbelief unreasonable and criminal.

   1. In the first place, its authors claim to be the messengers of God,
   to speak by his authority and in his name, so that what they teach is
   to be received not on the authority of the writers themselves, nor on
   the ground of the inherent evidence in the nature of the truths
   communicated, but upon the authority of God. It is He who affirms what
   the sacred writers teach. This claim must be admitted, or the sacred
   writers must be regarded as fanatics or impostors. It is absolutely
   certain that they were neither. It would be no more irrational to
   pronounce Homer and Newton idiots, than to set down Isaiah and Paul as
   either impostors or fanatics. It is as certain as any self-evident
   truth, that they were wise, good, sober-minded men. That such men
   should falsely assume to be the authoritative messengers of God, and to
   be endowed with supernatural powers in confirmation of their mission,
   is a contradiction. It is to affirm that wise and good men are foolish
   and wicked.

   2. The Bible contains nothing inconsistent with the claim of its
   authors to divine authority as teachers. It contains nothing
   impossible, nothing absurd, nothing immoral, nothing inconsistent with
   any well-authenticated truth. This itself is well-nigh miraculous,
   considering the circumstances under which the different portions of the
   Scriptures were written.

   3. More than this, the Bible reveals truths of the highest order, not
   elsewhere made known. Truths which meet the most urgent necessities of
   our nature; which solve the problems which reason has never been able
   to solve. It recognizes and authenticates all the facts of
   consciousness, all the truths which our moral and religious nature
   involve, and which we recognize as true as soon as they are presented.
   It has the same adaptation to the soul that the atmosphere has to the
   lungs, or the solar influences to the earth on which we live. And what
   the earth would be without those influences, is, in point of fact, what
   the soul is without knowledge of the truths which we derive solely from
   the Bible.

   4. The several books of which the Scriptures are composed were written
   by some fifty different authors living in the course of fifteen hundred
   years and yet they are found to be an organic whole, the product of one
   mind. They are as clearly a development as the oak from the acorn. The
   gospels and epistles are but the expansion, fulfilment, the culmination
   of the protevangelium, "The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpents
   head," as uttered to our first parents (Gen. iii. 15). All that
   intervenes is to the New Testament what the roots, stem, branches, and
   foliage of the tree are to the fruit. No one book of Scripture can be
   understood by itself, any more than any one part of a tree or member of
   the body can be understood without reference to the whole of which it
   is a part. Those who from want of attention do not perceive this
   organic relation of the different parts of the Bible, cannot appreciate
   the argument thence derived in favor of its divine origin. They who do
   perceive it, cannot resist it.

   Argument from Prophecy.

   5. God bears witness to the divine authority of the Scriptures by signs
   and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost. The
   leading events recorded in the New Testament were predicted in the Old.
   Of this any man may satisfy himself by a comparison of the two. The
   coincidence between the prophecies and the fulfilment admits of no
   rational solution, except that the Bible is the work of God; or, that
   holy men of old spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. The
   miracles recorded in the Scriptures are historical events, which are
   not only entitled to be received on the same testimony which
   authenticates other facts of history, but they are so implicated with
   the whole structure of the New Testament, that they cannot be denied
   without rejecting the whole gospel, which rejection involves the denial
   of the best authenticated facts in the history of the world.

   Argument from the Effects of the Gospel.

   Besides this external supernatural testimony, the Bible is everywhere
   attended by "the demonstration of the Spirit," which gives to its
   doctrines the clearness of self-evident truths, and the authority of
   the voice of God; analogous to the authority of the moral law for the
   natural conscience.

   6. The Bible ever has been and still is, a power in the world. It has
   determined the course of history. It has overthrown false religion
   wherever it is known. It is the parent of modern civilization. It is
   the only guarantee of social order, of virtue, and of human rights and
   liberty. Its effects cannot be rationally accounted for upon any other
   hypothesis than that it is what it claims to be, "The Word of God."

   7. It makes known the person, work, the acts, and words of Christ, who
   is the clearest revelation of God ever made to man. He is the
   manifested God. His words were the words of God. His acts were the acts
   of God. His voice is the voice of God, and He said, "The Scripture
   cannot be broken" (John x. 35). If any man refuse to recognize him as
   the Son of God, as the infallible teacher, and only Saviour of men,
   nothing can be said save what the Apostle says, "If our gospel be hid,
   it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the God of this world hath
   blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the
   glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto
   them. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath
   shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory
   of God in the face of Jesus Christ." (2 Cor. iv. 3, 4, 6.)

   Deistical Rationalism is in Germany sometimes called Naturalism, as
   distinguished from Supernaturalism; as the former denies, and the
   latter affirms, an agency or operation above nature in the conduct of
   events in this world. More commonly, however, by Naturalism is meant
   the theory which denies the existence of any higher power than nature,
   and therefore is only another name for atheism. It is, consequently,
   not a proper designation of a system which assumes the existence of a
   personal God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 3. The Second Form of Rationalism.

   A. Its Nature.

   The more common form of Rationalism admits that the Scriptures contain
   a supernatural revelation. It teaches, however, that the object of that
   revelation is to make more generally known, and to authenticate for the
   masses, the truths of reason, or doctrines of natural religion. These
   doctrines are received by cultivated minds not on the ground of
   authority, but of rational evidence. The fundamental principle of this
   class of Rationalists is, that nothing can be rationally believed which
   is not understood. "Nil credi posse, quod a ratione capi et intelligi
   nequeat." If asked, Why he believes in the immortality of the soul? the
   Rationalist answers, Because the doctrine is reasonable. To his mind,
   the arguments in its favor outweigh those against it. If asked, Why he
   does not believe the doctrine of the Trinity? he answers, Because it is
   unreasonable. The philosophical arguments against it outweigh the
   arguments from reason, in its favor. That the sacred writers teach the
   doctrine is not decisive. The Rationalist does not feel bound to
   believe all that the sacred writers teach. The Bible, he admits,
   contains a Divine revelation. But this revelation was made to fallible
   men, men under no supernatural guidance in communicating the truths
   revealed. They were men whose mode of thinking, and manner of arguing,
   and of presenting truth, were modified by their culture, and by the
   modes of thought prevailing during the age in which they lived. The
   Scriptures, therefore, abound with misapprehensions, with inconclusive
   arguments, and accommodations to Jewish errors, superstitions, arid
   popular beliefs. It is the office of reason to sift these incongruous
   materials, and separate the wheat from the chaff. That is wheat which
   reason apprehends in its own light to be true; that is to be rejected
   as chaff which reason cannot understand, and cannot prove to be true.
   That is, nothing is true to us which we do not see for ourselves to be
   true.

   B. Refutation.

   It is sufficient to remark on this form of Rationalism, --

   1. That it is founded upon a false principle. It is not necessary to
   the rational exercise of faith that we should understand the truth
   believed. The unknown and the impossible cannot be believed; but every
   man does, and must believe the incomprehensible. Assent to truth is
   founded on evidence. That evidence may be external or intrinsic. Some
   things we believe on the testimony of our senses; other things we
   believe on the testimony of men. Why, then, may we not believe on the
   testimony of God? A man may believe that paper thrown upon fire will
   burn, although he does not understand the process of combustion. All
   men believe that plants grow, and that like begets like; but no man
   understands the mystery of reproduction. Even the Positivist who would
   reduce all belief to zero, is obliged to admit the incomprehensible to
   be true. And those who will believe neither in God nor spirit because
   they are invisible and intangible, say that all we know is the
   unknowable, -- we know only force, but of force we know nothing but
   that it is, and that it persists. If, therefore, the incomprehensible
   must be believed in every other department of knowledge, no rational
   ground can be given why it should be banished from religion.

   2. Rationalism assumes that the human intelligence is the measure of
   all truth. This is an insane presumption on the part of such a creature
   as man. If a child believes with implicit confidence what it cannot
   understand, on the testimony of a parent, surely man may believe what
   he cannot understand, on the testimony of God.

   3. Rationalism destroys the distinction between faith and knowledge,
   which all men and all ages admit. Faith is assent to truth founded on
   testimony, "credo quod non video." Knowledge is assent founded on the
   direct or indirect, the intuitive or discursive, apprehension of its
   object. If there can be no rational faith, if we are to receive as true
   only what we know and understand, the whole world is beggared. It loses
   all that sustains, beautifies, and ennobles life.

   4. The poor cannot be Rationalists. If we must understand what we
   believe, even on the principles of the Rationalists, only philosophers
   can be religious. They alone can comprehend the rational grounds on
   which the great truths of even natural religion are to be received.
   Widespread, therefore, as has been the influence of a Rationalistic
   spirit, it has never taken hold of the people; it has never controlled
   the creed of any church; because all religion is founded on the
   incomprehensible and the infinite.

   5. The protest, therefore, which our religious nature makes against the
   narrow, cold, and barren system of Rationalism, is a sufficient proof
   that it cannot be true, because it cannot meet our most urgent
   necessities. The object of worship must be infinite, and of necessity
   incomprehensible.

   6. Faith implies knowledge. And if we must understand in order to know,
   faith and knowledge become alike impossible. The principle, therefore,
   on which Rationalism is founded, leads to Nihilism, or universal
   negation. Even the latest form of philosophy, taking the lowest
   possible ground as to religious faith, admits that we are surrounded on
   every side by the incomprehensible.

   Herbert Spencer, in his "First Principles of a New Philosophy,"
   asserts, p. 45, "the omnipresence of something which passes
   comprehension." He declares that the ultimate truth in which all forms
   of religion agree, and in which religion and science are in harmony,
   is, "That the Power which the universe manifests to us is utterly
   inscrutable." [10] The inscrutable, the incomprehensible, what we
   cannot understand, must therefore of necessity be rationally the object
   of faith. And consequently reason, rational demonstration, or
   philosophical proof is not the ground of faith. We may rationally
   believe what we cannot understand. We may be assured of truths which
   are encompassed with objections which we cannot satisfactorily answer.

   C. History.

   The modern form of Deistic Rationalism had its rise in England during
   the latter part of the seventeenth, and the first half of the
   eighteenth centuries. Lord Herbert, who died as early as 1648, in his
   work, "De Veritate, prout distinguitur a Revelatione," etc., taught
   that all religion consists in the acknowledgment of the following
   truths: 1. The existence of God. 2. The dependence of man on God, and
   his obligation to reverence him. 3. Piety consists in the harmony of
   the human faculties. 4. The essential difference between good and evil.
   5. A future state of rewards and punishment. These he held to be
   intuitive truths, needing no proof, and virtually believed by all men.
   This may be considered as the confession of Faith of all Deists, and
   even of those Rationalists who admit a supernatural revelation; for
   such revelation, they maintain, can only authenticate what reason
   itself teaches. Other writers quickly followed in the course opened by
   Lord Herbert; as, Toland in his "Christianity without Mystery," 1696, a
   work which excited great attention, and drew out numerous refutations.
   Toland ended by avowing himself a Pantheist. Hobbes was a Materialist.
   Lord Shaftesbury, who died 1773, in his "Characteristics,"
   "Miscellaneous Treatises," and "Moralist," made ridicule the test of
   truth. He declared revelation and inspiration to be fanaticism. Collins
   (died 1729) was a more serious writer. His principal works were, "An
   Essay on Free-thinking," and "The Grounds and Reasons of Christianity."
   Lord Bolingbroke, Secretary of State under Queen Anne, "Letters on the
   Study and Utility of History." Matthew Tindal, "Christianity as Old as
   the Creation." Tindal, instead of attacking Christianity in detail,
   attempted to construct a regular system of Deism. He maintained that
   God could not intend that men should ever be without a religion
   adequate to all their necessities, and therefore that a revelation can
   only make known what every man has in his own reason. This internal and
   universal revelation contains the two truths: 1. The existence of God.
   2. That God created man not for his own sake, but for man's. By far the
   most able and influential of the writers of this class was David Hume.
   His "Essays" in four volumes contain his theological views. The most
   important of these are those on the Natural History of Religion, and on
   Miracles. His "Dialogues on Natural Religion" is regarded as the ablest
   work ever written in support of the Deistical, or rather, Atheistical
   system.

   From England the spirit of infidelity extended into France. Voltaire,
   Rousseau, La Mettrie, Holbach, D'Alembert, Diderot, and others,
   succeeded for a time in overthrowing all religious faith in the
   governing classes of society.

   Rationalism in Germany.

   In Germany the Rationalistic defection began with such men as
   Baumgarten, Ernesti, and John David Michaelis, who did not deny the
   divine authority of the Scriptures, but explained away their doctrines.
   These were followed by such men as Semler, Morus, and Eichhorn, who
   were thoroughly neological. During the latter part of the last, and
   first part of the present century, most of the leading church
   historians, exegetes, and theologians of Germany, were Rationalists.
   The first serious blow given to their system was by Kant. The
   Rationalists assumed that they were able to demonstrate the truths of
   natural religion on the principles of reason. Kant, in his "Critic of
   Pure Reason," undertook to show that reason is incompetent to prove any
   religious truth. The only foundation for religion he maintained was our
   moral consciousness. That consciousness involved or implied the three
   great doctrines of God, liberty, and immortality. His successors,
   Fichte and Schelling, carried out the principles which Kant adopted to
   prove that the outward world is an unknown something, to show that
   there was no such world; that there was no real distinction between the
   ego and non-ego, the subjective and objective; that both are modes of
   the manifestation of the absolute. Thus all things were merged into
   one. This idealistic Pantheism having displaced Rationalism, has
   already yielded the philosophic throne to a subtle form of Materialism.

   Bretschneiders "Entwickelung aller in der Dogmatik vorkommenden
   Begriffe," gives a list of fifty-two works on the rationalistic
   controversy in Germany. The English books written against the
   Rationalists or Deists of Great Britain, and on the proper office of
   reason in matters of religion, are scarcely less numerous. Some of the
   more important of these works are the following: "Boyle on Things above
   Reason," Butler's "Analogy of Religion and Nature," Conybeare's
   "Defence of Religion," "Hulsean Lectures," Jackson's "Examination,"
   "Jew's Letters to Voltaire," Lardner's "Credibility of the Gospel
   History," Leland's "Advantage and Necessity of Revelation," Leslie's
   "Short and Easy Method with Deists." Warburton's "View of Bolingbroke's
   Philosophy," and his "Divine Legation of Moses," John Wilson's
   "Dissertation on Christianity," etc., etc. See Stäudlin's "Geschichte
   des Rationalismus," and a concise and instructive history of theology
   during the eighteenth century, by Dr. Tholuck in "Biblical Repertory
   and Princeton Review" for 1828. Leibnitz's "Discours de la Conformité
   de la Foi avec la Raison," in the Preface to his "Théodicée," and
   Mansel's "Limits of Religious Thought," deserve the careful perusal of
   the theological student. The most recent works on this general subject
   are Lecky's "History of Rationalism in Europe, and "History of
   Rationalism, embracing a survey of the present state of Protestant
   Theology," by Rev. John F. Hurst, A. M. The latter is the most
   instructive publication in the English language on modern skepticism.

   4. Dogmatism, or the Third Form of Rationalism.

   A. Meaning of the Term.

   It was a common objection made in the early age of the Church against
   Christianity, by the philosophical Greeks, that its doctrines were
   received upon authority, and not upon rational evidence. Many of the
   Fathers, specially those of the Alexandrian school, answered that this
   was true only of the common people. They could not be expected to
   understand philosophy. They could receive the high spiritual truths of
   religion only on the ground of authority. But the educated classes were
   able and were bound to search after the philosophical or rational
   evidence of the doctrines taught in the Bible, and to receive those
   doctrines on the ground of that evidence. They made a distinction,
   therefore, between pistis and gnosis, faith and knowledge. The former
   was for the common people, the latter for the cultivated. The objects
   of faith were the doctrinal statements of the Bible in the form in
   which they are there presented. The ground of faith is simply the
   testimony of the Scriptures as the Word of God. The objects of
   knowledge were the speculative or philosophical ideas which underlie
   the doctrines of the Bible, and the ground on which those ideas or
   truths are received and incorporated in our system of knowledge, is
   their own inherent evidence. They are seen to be true by the light of
   reason. Faith is thus elevated into knowledge, and Christianity exalted
   into a philosophy. This method was carried out by the Platonizing
   fathers, and continued to prevail to a great extent among the
   schoolmen. During the Middle Ages the authority of the Church was
   paramount, and the freest thinkers did not venture openly to impugn the
   doctrines which the Church had sanctioned. For the most part they
   contented themselves with philosophizing about those doctrines, and
   endeavoring to show that they admitted of a philosophical explanation
   and proof.

   Wolfianism.

   As remarked in the preceding chapter, this method was revived and
   extensively propagated by Wolf (1679-1754, Professor at Halle and
   Marburg). His principal works were "Theologia Naturalis," 1736,
   "Philos. Practicalis Universalis," 1738, "Philos. Moralis s. Ethica,"
   1750, "Vernünftige Gedanken von Gott, der Welt und der Seele des
   Menschen, auch allen Dingen überhaupt," 1720. Wolf unduly exalted the
   importance of natural religion. Although he admitted that the
   Scriptures revealed doctrines undiscoverable by the unassisted reason
   of man, he yet insisted that all doctrines, in order to be rationally
   received as true, should be capable of demonstration on the principles
   of reason. "He maintained," says Mr. Rose (in his "State of
   Protestantisin in Germany," p. 39), "that philosophy was indispensable
   to religion, and that, together with Biblical proofs, a mathematical or
   strictly demonstrative dogmatical system, according to the principles
   of reason, was absolutely necessary. His own works carried this theory
   into practice, and after the first clamors had subsided, his opinions
   gained more attention, and it was not long before he had a school of
   vehement admirers, who far outstripped him in the use of his own
   principles. We find some of them not content with applying
   demonstration to the truth of the system, but endeavoring to establish
   each separate dogma, the Trinity, the nature of the Redeemer, the
   Incarnation, the eternity of punishment, on philosophical, and strange
   as it may appear, some of these truths on mathematical grounds." The
   language of Wolf himself on this subject has already been quoted on
   page 5. He expressly states that the office of revelation is to
   supplement natural religion, and to present propositions which the
   philosopher is bound to demonstrate. By demonstration is not meant the
   adduction of proof that the proposition is sustained the Scriptures,
   but that the doctrine must be admitted as true on the principles of
   reason. It is philosophical demonstration that is intended.
   "Theological Dogmatism," says Mansel, [11] "is an application of reason
   to the support and defense of preëxisting statements of Scripture. . .
   . . Its end is to produce a coincidence between what we believe and
   what we think; to remove the boundary which separates the
   comprehensible from the incomprehensible." [12] It attempts, for
   example, to demonstrate the doctrine of the Trinity from the nature of
   an infinite being; the doctrine of the Incarnation from the nature of
   man and his relation to God, etc. Its grand design is to transmute
   faith into knowledge, to elevate Christianity as a system of revealed
   truth into a system of Philosophy.

   B. Refutation.

   The objections to Dogmatism, as thus understood, are, --

   That it is essentially Rationalistic. The Rationalist demands
   philosophical proof of the doctrines which he receives. He is not
   willing to believe on the simple authority of Scripture. He requires
   his reason to be satisfied by a demonstration of the truth independent
   of the Bible. This demand the Dogmatist admits to be reasonable, and he
   undertakes to furnish the required proof. In this essential point,
   therefore, in making the reception of Christian doctrine to rest on
   reason and not on authority, the Dogmatist and the Rationalist are on
   common ground. For although the former admits a supernatural
   revelation, and acknowledges that for the common people faith must rest
   on authority, yet he maintains that the mysteries of religion admit of
   rational or philosophical demonstration, and that such demonstration
   cultivated minds have a right to demand.

   2. In thus shifting faith from the foundation of divine testimony, and
   making it rest on rational demonstration, it is removed from the Rock
   of Ages to a quicksand. There is all the difference between a
   conviction founded on the well-authenticated testimony of God, and that
   founded on so-called philosophical demonstration, that there is between
   God and man, the divine and human. Let any man read the pretended
   philosophical demonstrations of the Trinity, the Incarnation, the
   resurrection of the body, or any other of the great truths of the
   Bible, and he will feel at liberty to receive or to reject it at
   pleasure. It has no authority or certainty. It is the product of a mind
   like his own, and therefore can have no more power than belongs to the
   fallible human intellect.

   3. Dogmatism is, therefore, in its practical effect, destructive of
   faith. In transmuting Christianity into a philosophy, its whole nature
   is changed and its power is lost. It takes its place as one of the
   numberless phases of human speculation, which in the history of human
   thought succeed each other as the waves of the sea, -- no one ever
   abides.

   4. It proceeds on an essentially false principle. It assumes the
   competency of reason to judge of things entirely beyond its sphere. God
   has so constituted our nature, that we are authorized and necessitated
   to confide in the well-authenticated testimony of our senses, within
   their appropriate sphere. And in like manner, we are constrained to
   confide in the operation of our minds and in the conclusions to which
   they lead, within the sphere which God has assigned to human reason.
   But the senses cannot sit in judgment on rational truths. We cannot
   study logic with the microscope or scalpel. It is no less irrational to
   depend upon reason, or demand rational or philosophical demonstration
   for truths which become the objects of knowledge only as they are
   revealed. From the nature of the case the truths concerning the
   creation, the probation, and apostasy of man, the purpose and plan of
   redemption, the person of Christ, the state of the soul in the future
   world, the relation of God to his creatures, etc., not depending on
   general principles of reason, but in great measure on the purposes of
   an intelligent, personal Being, can be known only so far as He chooses
   to reveal them, and must be received simply on his authority.

   The Testimony of the Scriptures against Dogmatism.

   5. The testimony of the Scriptures is decisive on this subject. From
   the beginning to the end of the Bible the sacred writers present
   themselves in the character of witnesses. They demand faith in their
   teachings and obedience to their commands not on the ground of their
   own superiority in wisdom or excellence; not on the ground of rational
   demonstration of the truth of what they taught, but simply as the
   organs of God, as men appointed by Him to reveal his will. Their first
   and last, and sufficient reason for faith is, "Thus saith the Lord."
   The New Testament writers, especially, repudiate all claim to the
   character of philosophers. They taught that the Gospel was not a system
   of truth derived from reason or sustained by its authority, but by the
   testimony of God. They expressly assert that its doctrines were matters
   of revelation, to be received on divine testimony. "Eye hath not seen,
   nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things
   which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed
   them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea,
   the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, save
   the spirit of man which is in him?" (1 Cor. ii. 9-11.) Such being the
   nature of the Gospel, if received at all it must be received on
   authority. It was to be believed or taken on trust, not demonstrated as
   a philosophical system. Nay, the Bible goes still further. It teaches
   that a man must become a fool in order to be wise; he must renounce
   dependence upon his own reason or wisdom, in order to receive the
   wisdom of God. Our Lord told his disciples that unless they were
   converted and became as little children, they could not enter into the
   kingdom of God. And the Apostle Paul, in his Epistle to the
   Corinthians, and in those addressed to the Ephesians and Colossians,
   that is, when writing to those imbued with the Greek and with the
   oriental philosophy, made it the indispensable condition of their
   becoming Christians, that they should renounce philosophy as a guide in
   matters of religion, and receive the Gospel on the testimony of God.
   Nothing, therefore, can be more opposed to the whole teaching and
   spirit of the Bible, than this disposition to insist on philosophical
   proof of the articles of our faith. Our duty, privilege, and security
   are in believing, not in knowing; in trusting God, and not our own
   understanding. They are to be pitied who have no more trustworthy
   teacher than themselves.

   6. The instructions of the Bible on this subject are abundantly
   confirmed by the lessons of experience. From the time of the Gnostics,
   and of the Platonizing fathers, the attempt has been made in every age
   to exalt faith into knowledge, to transmute Christianity into
   philosophy, by demonstrating its doctrines on the principles of reason.
   These attempts have always failed. They have all proved ephemeral and
   worthless, -- each successive theorizer viewing with more or less
   contempt the speculations of his predecessors, yet each imagining that
   he has the gifts for comprehending the Almighty.

   These attempts are not only abortive, they are always evil in their
   effects upon their authors and upon all who are influenced by them. So
   far as they succeed to the satisfaction of those who make them, they
   change the relation of the soul to the truth, and, of course, to God.
   The reception of the truth is not an act of faith or of trust in God;
   but of confidence in our own speculations. Self is substituted for God
   as the ground of confidence. The man's whole inward state is thereby
   changed. History, moreover, proves that Dogmatism is the predecessor of
   Rationalism. The natural tendency and the actual consequences of the
   indulgence of a disposition to demand philosophical demonstration for
   articles of faith, is a state of mind which revolts at authority, and
   refuses to admit as true what it cannot comprehend and prove. And this
   state of mind, as it is incompatible with faith, is the parent of
   unbelief and of all its consequences. There is no safety for us,
   therefore, but to remain within the limits which God has assigned us.
   Let us rely on our senses, within the sphere of our sense perceptions;
   on our reason within the sphere of rational truths; and on God, and God
   alone, in all that relates to the things of God. He only truly knows,
   who consents with the docility of a child to be taught of God.

   § 5. Proper Office of Reason in Matters of Religion.

   A. Reason Necessary for the Reception of a Revelation.

   Christians, in repudiating Rationalism in all its forms, do not reject
   the service of reason in matters of religion. They acknowledge its high
   prerogatives, and the responsibility involved in their exercise.

   In the first place, reason is necessarily presupposed in every
   revelation. Revelation is the communication of truth to the mind. But
   the communication of truth supposes the capacity to receive it.
   Revelations cannot he made to brutes or to idiots. Truths, to be
   received as objects of faith, must be intellectually apprehended. A
   proposition, to which we attach no meaning, however important the truth
   it may contain, cannot be an object of faith. If it be affirmed that
   the soul is immortal, or God is a spirit, unless we know the meaning of
   the words nothing is communicated to the mind, and the mind can affirm
   or deny nothing on the subject. In other words, knowledge is essential
   to faith. In believing we affirm the truth of the proposition believed.
   But we can affirm nothing of that of which we know nothing. The first
   and indispensable office of reason, therefore, in matters of faith, is
   the cognition, or intelligent apprehension of the truths proposed for
   our reception. This is what theologians are accustomed to call the usus
   organicus, seu, instrumentalis, rationis. About this there can be no
   dispute.

   Difference between Knowing and Understanding.

   It is important, however, to bear in mind the difference between
   knowing and understanding, or comprehending. A child knows what the
   words "God is a spirit" mean. No created being can comprehend the
   Almighty unto perfection. We must know the plan of salvation; but no
   one can comprehend its mysteries. This distinction is recognized in
   every department. Men know unspeakably more than they understand. We
   know that plants grow; that the will controls our voluntary muscles;
   that Jesus Christ is God and man in two distinct natures, and one
   person forever; but here as everywhere we are surrounded by the
   incomprehensible. We can rationally believe that a thing is, without
   knowing how or why it is. It is enough for the true dignity of man as a
   rational creature, that he is not called upon by his Creator to believe
   without knowledge, to receive as true propositions which convey no
   meaning to the mind. This would be not only irrational, but impossible.

   B. Reason must judge of the Credibility of a Revelation.

   In the second place, it is the prerogative of reason to judge of the
   credibility of a revelation. The word "credible" is sometimes popularly
   used to mean, easy of belief, i.e., probable. In its proper sense, it
   is antithetical to incredible. The incredible is that which cannot be
   believed. The credible is that which can be believed. Nothing is
   incredible but the impossible. What may be, may be rationally (i.e., on
   adequate grounds) believed.

   A thing may be strange, unaccountable, unintelligible, and yet
   perfectly credible. What is strange or unaccountable to one mind may be
   perfectly familiar and plain to another. For the most limited intellect
   or experience to make itself the standard of the possible and true,
   would be as absurd as a man's making his visible horizon the limit of
   space. Unless a man is willing to believe the incomprehensible, he can
   believe nothing, and must dwell forever in cuter darkness. The most
   skeptical form of modern philosophy, which reduces faith and knowledge
   to a minimum, teaches that the incomprehensible is all we know namely,
   that force is, and that it is persistent. It is most unreasonable,
   therefore, to urge as an objection to Christianity that it demands
   faith in the incomprehensible.

   The Impossible cannot be believed.

   While this is true and plain, it is no less true that the impossible is
   incredible, and therefore cannot be an object of faith. Christians
   concede to reason the judicium contradictionis, that is, the
   prerogative of deciding whether a thing is possible or impossible. If
   it is seen to be impossible, no authority, and no amount or kind of
   evidence can impose the obligation to receive it as true. Whether,
   however, a thing be possible or not, is not to be arbitrarily
   determined. Men are prone to pronounce everything impossible which
   contradicts their settled convictions, their preconceptions or
   prejudices, or which is repugnant to their feelings. Men in former
   times did not hesitate to say that it is impossible that the earth
   should turn round on its axis and move through space with incredible
   rapidity, and yet we not perceive it. It was pronounced absolutely
   impossible that information should be transmitted thousands of miles in
   the fraction of a second. Of course it would be folly to reject all
   evidence of such facts as these on the ground of their being
   impossible. It is no less unreasonable for men to reject the truths of
   revelation on the assumption that they involve the impossible, when
   they contradict our previous convictions, or when we cannot see how
   they can be. Men say that it is impossible that the same person can be
   both God and man; and yet they admit that man is at once material and
   immaterial, mortal and immortal, angel and animal. The impossible
   cannot be true; but reason in pronouncing a thing impossible must act
   rationally and not capriciously. Its judgments must be guided by
   principles which commend themselves to the common consciousness of men.
   Such principles are the following: --

   What is Impossible.

   (1.) That is impossible which involves a contradiction; as, that a
   thing is and is not; that right is wrong, and wrong right. (2.) It is
   impossible that God should do, approve, or command what is morally
   wrong. (3.) It is impossible that He should require us to believe what
   contradicts any of the laws of belief which He has impressed upon our
   nature. (4.) It is impossible that one truth should contradict another.
   It is impossible, therefore, that God should reveal anything as true
   which contradicts any well authenticated truth, whether of intuition,
   experience, or previous revelation.

   Men may abuse this prerogative of reason, as they abuse their free
   agency. But the prerogative itself is not to be denied. We have a right
   to reject as untrue whatever it is impossible that God should require
   us to believe. He can no more require us to believe what is absurd than
   to do what is wrong.

   Proof of this Prerogative of Reason.

   1. That reason has the prerogative of the judicium contradictionis, is
   plain, in the first place, from the very nature of the case. Faith
   includes an affirmation of the mind that a thing is true. But it is a
   contradiction to say that the mind can affirm that to be true which it
   sees cannot by possibility be true. This would be to affirm and deny,
   to believe and disbelieve, at the same time. From the very constitution
   of our nature, therefore, we are forbidden to believe the impossible.
   We are, consequently, not only authorized, but required to pronounce
   anathema an apostle or angel from heaven, who should call upon us to
   receive as a revelation from God anything absurd, or wicked, or
   inconsistent with the intellectual or moral nature with which He has
   endowed us. The subjection of the human intelligence to God is indeed
   absolute; but it is a subjection to infinite wisdom and goodness. As it
   is impossible that God should contradict himself, so it is impossible
   that He should, by an external revelation, declare that to be true
   which by the laws of our nature He has rendered it impossible we should
   believe.

   2. This prerogative of reason is constantly recognized in Scripture.
   The prophets called upon the people to reject the doctrines of the
   heathen, because they could not be true. They could not be true because
   they involved contradictions and absurdities; because they were in
   contradiction to our moral nature, and inconsistent with known truths.
   Moses taught that nothing was to be believed, no matter what amount of
   external evidence should be adduced in its support, which contradicted
   a previous, duly authenticated revelation from God. Paul does the same
   thing when he calls upon us to pronounce even an angel accursed, who
   should teach another gospel. He recognized the paramount authority of
   the intuitive judgments of the mind. He says that the damnation of any
   man is just who calls upon us to believe that right is wrong, or that
   men should do evil that good may come.

   3. The ultimate ground of faith and knowledge is confidence in God. We
   can neither believe nor know anything unless we confide in those laws
   of belief which God has implanted in our nature. If we can be required
   to believe what contradicts those laws, then the foundations are broken
   up. All distinction between truth and falsehood, between right and
   wrong, would disappear. All our ideas of God and virtue would be
   confounded, and we should become the victims of every adroit deceiver,
   or minister of Satan, who, by lying wonders, should call upon us to
   believe a lie. We are to try the spirits. But how can we try them
   without a standard? and what other standard can there be, except the
   laws of our nature and the authenticated revelations of God.

   C. Reason must judge of the Evidences of a Revelation.

   In the third place, reason must judge of the evidence by which a
   revelation is supported.

   On this point it may be remarked, --

   1. That as faith involves assent, and assent is conviction produced by
   evidence, it follows that faith without evidence is either irrational
   or impossible.

   2. This evidence must be appropriate to the nature of the truth
   believed. Historical truth requires historical evidence; empirical
   truths, the testimony of experience; mathematical truth, mathematical
   evidence; moral truth, moral evidence; and "the things of the Spirit,"
   the demonstration of the Spirit. In many cases different kinds of
   evidence concur in the support of the same truth. That Jesus is the
   Christ, the Son of the living God, for example, is sustained by
   evidence, historical, moral, and spiritual, so abundant that our Lord
   says of those who reject it, that the wrath of God abideth on them.

   3. Evidence must be not only appropriate, but adequate. That is, such
   as to command assent in every well-constituted mind to which it is
   presented.

   As we cannot believe without evidence, and as that evidence must be
   appropriate and adequate, it is clearly a prerogative of reason to
   judge of these several points. This is plain.

   1. From the nature of faith, which is not a blind, irrational assent,
   but an intelligent reception of the truth on adequate grounds.

   2. The Scriptures never demand faith except on the ground of adequate
   evidence. "If I had not done among them," says our Lord, "the works
   which none other man did, they had not had sin" (John xv. 24); clearly
   recognizing the principle that faith cannot be required without
   evidence. The Apostle Paul proves that the heathen are justly liable to
   condemnation for their idolatry and immorality, because such a
   revelation of the true God and of the moral law had been made to them,
   as to leave them without excuse.

   3. The Bible regards unbelief as a sin, and the great sin for which men
   will be condemned at the bar of God. This presumes that unbelief cannot
   arise from the want of appropriate and adequate evidence, but is to be
   referred to the wicked rejection of the truth notwithstanding the proof
   by which it is attended. The popular misconception that men are not
   responsible for their faith arises from a confusion of ideas. It is
   true that men are not blameworthy for not believing in speculative
   truths, when the cause of their unbelief is ignorance of the fact or of
   its evidence. It is no sin not to believe that he earth moves round the
   sun, if one be ignorant of the fact or of the evidence of its truth.
   But wherever unbelief arises from an evil heart, then it involves all
   the guilt which belongs to the cause whence it springs. If the wicked
   hate the good and believe them to be as wicked as themselves, this is
   only a proof of their wickedness. If a man does not believe in the
   moral law; if he holds that might is right, that the strong may rob,
   murder, or oppress the weak, as some philosophers teach, or if he
   disbelieve in the existence of God, then it is evident to men and
   angels that he has been given up to a reprobate mind. There is an
   evidence of beauty to which nothing but want of taste can render one
   insensible; there is evidence of moral excellence to which nothing but
   an evil heart can render us blind. Why did the Jews reject Christ,
   notwithstanding all the evidence presented in his character, in his
   words, and in his works, that he was the Son of God? "He that believeth
   on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned
   already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten
   Son of God." (John iii. 18.) The fact, however, that unbelief is a
   great sin, and the special ground of the condemnation of men, of
   necessity supposes that it is inexcusable, that it does not arise from
   ignorance or want of evidence. "How shall they believe," asks the
   Apostle, "in him of whom they have not heard." (Rom. x. 14.) And our
   Lord says, "This is the condemnation, that light is come into the
   world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds
   were evil." (John iii. 19.)

   4. Another evidence that the Scriptures recognize the necessity of
   evidence in order to faith, and the right of those to whom a revelation
   is addressed to judge of that evidence, is found in the frequent
   command to consider, to examine, to try the spirits, i.e., those who
   claim to be the organs of the Spirit of God. The duty of judging is
   enjoined, and the standard of judgment is given. And then men are held
   responsible for their decision.

   Christians, therefore, concede to reason all the prerogatives it can
   rightfully claim. God requires nothing irrational of his rational
   creatures. He does not require faith without knowledge, or faith in the
   impossible, or faith without evidence. Christianity is equally opposed
   to superstition and Rationalism. The one is faith without appropriate
   evidence, the other refuses to believe what it does not understand, in
   despite of evidence which should command belief. The Christian,
   conscious of his imbecility as a creature, and his ignorance and
   blindness as a sinner, places himself before God, in the posture of a
   child, and receives as true everything which a God of infinite
   intelligence and goodness declares to be worthy of confidence. And in
   thus submitting to be taught, he acts on the highest principles of
   reason.

   § 6. Relation of Philosophy and Revelation.

   Cicero [13] defines philosophy as "Rerum divinarum et humanarum,
   causarumque quibus hæ res continentur, scientia." Peemans [14] says,
   "Philosophia est scientia rerum per causas primas, recto rationis usu
   comparata." Or, as Ferrier [15] more concisely expresses it,
   "Philosophy is the attainment of truth by the way of reason." These and
   other definitions are to be found in Fleming's "Vocabulary of
   Philosophy."

   There is, however, a philosophia prima, or first philosophy, which is
   concerned not so much with what is to be known, as with the faculty of
   knowledge, which examines the cognitive faculty, determines its laws
   and its limits. It is the philosophy of philosophy.

   Whether we take the word to mean the knowledge of God and nature
   attained by reason, or the principles which should guide all efforts
   for the attainment of knowledge, the word is intended to cover the
   whole domain of human intelligence. Popularly, we distinguish between
   philosophy and science; the former having for its sphere the spiritual,
   the latter, the material. Commonly, philosophy is understood as
   comprising both departments. Hence we speak of natural philosophy as
   well as of the philosophy of mind. Such being the compass of the domain
   which philosophers claim as their own, the proper relation between
   philosophy and theology becomes a question of vital importance. This
   is, indeed, the great question at issue in the Rationalistic
   controversy; and therefore, at the conclusion of this chapter, all that
   remains to be done is to give a concise statement of familiar
   principles.

   Philosophy and Theology occupy Common Ground.

   1. Philosophy and Theology occupy common ground. Both assume to teach
   what is true concerning God, man, the world, and the relation in which
   God stands to his creatures.

   2. While their objects are so far identical, both striving to attain a
   knowledge of the same truths, their methods are essentially different.
   Philosophy seeks to attain knowledge by speculation and induction, or
   by the exercise of our own intellectual faculties. Theology relies upon
   authority, receiving as truth whatever God in his Word has revealed.

   3. Both these methods are legitimate. Christians do not deny that our
   senses and reason are reliable informants; that they enable us to
   arrive at certainty as to what lies within their sphere.

   4. God is the author of our nature and the maker of heaven and earth,
   therefore nothing which the laws of our nature or the facts of the
   external world prove to be true, can contradict the teaching of God's
   Word. Neither can the Scriptures contradict the truths of philosophy or
   science.

   Philosophers and Theologians should Strive after Unity.

   5. As these two great sources of knowledge must be consistent in their
   valid teachings, it is the duty of all parties to endeavor to exhibit
   that consistency. Philosophers should not ignore the teachings of the
   Bible, and theologians should not ignore the teachings of science. Much
   less should either class needlessly come into collision with the other.
   It is unreasonable and irreligious for philosophers to adopt and
   promulgate theories inconsistent with the facts of the Bible, when
   those theories are sustained by only plausible evidence, which does not
   command the assent even of the body of scientific men themselves. On
   the other hand, it is unwise for theologians to insist on an
   interpretation of Scripture which brings it into collision with the
   facts of science. Both of these mistakes are often made. The Bible, for
   example, clearly teaches the unity of the existing races of men, both
   as to origin and species. Many Naturalists, however, insist that they
   are diverse, some say, both in origin and kind, and others, in origin
   if not in species. This is done not only on merely plausible evidence,
   being one of several possible ways of accounting for acknowledged
   diversities, but in opposition to the most decisive proof to the
   contrary. This proof, so far as it is historical and philological, does
   not fall within the sphere of natural science, and therefore the mere
   Naturalist disregards it. Comparative philologists hold up their hands
   at the obtuseness of men of science, who maintain that races have had
   different origins, whose languages render it clear to demonstration
   that they have been derived from a common stock. Considering the
   overwhelming weight of evidence of the divine authority of the
   Scriptures, and the unspeakable importance of that authority being
   maintained over the minds and hearts of men, it evinces fearful
   recklessness on the part of those who wantonly impugn its teachings. On
   the other hand, it is unwise in theologians to array themselves
   needlessly against the teachings of science. Romanists and Protestants
   vainly resisted the adoption of the Copernican theory of our solar
   system. They interpreted the Bible in a sense contradictory to that
   theory. So far as in them lay, they staked the authority of the Bible
   on the correctness of their interpretation. The theory proved to be
   true, and the received interpretation had to be given up. The Bible,
   however, has received no injury, although theologians have been taught
   an important lesson; that is, to let science take its course, assured
   that the Scriptures will accommodate themselves to all
   well-authenticated scientific facts in time to come, as they have in
   time past.

   The Authority of Facts.

   6. The relation between Revelation and Philosophy (taking the word in
   its restricted sense) is different from that between Revelation and
   Science. Or, to express the same idea in different words, the relation
   between revelation and facts is one thing; and the relation between
   revelation and theories another thing. Facts do not admit of denial.
   They are determined by the wisdom and will of God. To deny facts, is to
   deny what God affirms to be true. This the Bible cannot do. It cannot
   contradict God. The theologian, therefore, acknowledges that the
   Scriptures must be interpreted in accordance with established facts. He
   has a right, however, to demand that those facts should be verified
   beyond the possibility of doubt. Scientific men in one age or country
   affirm the truth of facts, which others deny or disprove. It would be a
   lamentable spectacle to see the Church changing its doctrines, or its
   interpretation of Scripture, to suit the constantly changing
   representations of scientific men as to matters of fact.

   While acknowledging their obligation to admit undeniable facts,
   theologians are at liberty to receive or reject the theories deduced
   from those facts. Such theories are human speculations, and can have no
   higher authority than their own inherent probability. The facts of
   light, electricity, magnetism, are permanent. The theories concerning
   them are constantly changing. The facts of geology are to be admitted;
   the theories of geologists have no coercive authority. The facts of
   physiology and comparative anatomy may be received; but no man is bound
   to receive any of the various conflicting theories of development.
   Obvious as this distinction between facts and theories is, it is
   nevertheless often disregarded. Scientific men are disposed to demand
   for their theories, the authority due only to established facts. And
   theologians, because at liberty to reject theories, are sometimes led
   to assert their independence of facts.

   The Authority of the Bible higher than that of Philosophy.

   7. Philosophy, in its widest sense, being the conclusions of the human
   intelligence as to what is true, and the Bible being the declaration of
   God, as to what is true, it is plain that where the two contradict each
   other, philosophy must yield to revelation; man must yield to God. It
   has been admitted that revelation cannot contradict facts; that the
   Bible must be interpreted in accordance with what God has clearly made
   known in the constitution of our nature and in the outward world. But
   the great body of what passes for philosophy or science, is merely
   human speculation. What is the philosophy of the Orientals, of Brahmins
   and Buddhists, of the early Gnostics, of the Platonists, of the
   Scotists in the Middle Ages; of Leibnitz with his monads and
   preëstablished harmony; of Des Cartes and his vortices; of Kant and his
   categories; of Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, with their different
   theories of idealistic pantheism? The answer to that question is, that
   these systems of philosophy are so many forms of human speculation; and
   consequently that so far as these speculations agree with the Bible
   they are true; and so far as they differ from it, they are false and
   worthless. This is the ground which every believer, learned or
   unlearned, is authorized and bound to take. If the Bible teaches that
   God is a person, the philosophy that teaches that an infinite being
   cannot be a person, is false. If the Bible teaches that God creates,
   controls, regenerates, the philosophy that forbids the assumption that
   He acts in time, is to be rejected. If the Bible teaches that the soul
   exists after the dissolution of the body, the philosophy which teaches
   that man is only the ephemeral manifestation of a generic life in
   connection with a given corporeal organization, is to be dismissed
   without further examination. In short, the Bible teaches certain
   doctrines concerning the nature of God and his relation to the world;
   concerning the origin, nature, and destiny of man; concerning the
   nature of virtue, the ground of moral obligation, human liberty and
   responsibility; what is the rule of duty, what is right and what is
   wrong in all our relations to God and to our fellow creatures. These
   are subjects on which philosophy undertakes to speculate and dogmatize;
   if in any case these speculations come into conflict with what is
   taught or necessarily implied in the Bible, they are thereby refuted,
   as by a reductio ad absurdum. And the disposition which refuses to give
   up these speculations in obedience to the teaching of the Bible, is
   inconsistent with Christianity. It is the indispensable condition of
   salvation through the gospel, that we receive as true whatever God has
   revealed in his Word. We must make our choice between the wisdom of men
   and the wisdom of God. The wisdom of men is foolishness with God; and
   the wisdom of God is foolishness to the wise of this world.

   The relation, therefore, between philosophy and revelation, as
   determined by the Scriptures themselves, is what every right-minded man
   must approve. Everything is conceded to philosophy and science, which
   they can rightfully demand. It is admitted that they have a large and
   important sphere of investigation. It is admitted that within that
   sphere they are entitled to the greatest deference. It is cheerfully
   conceded that they have accomplished much, not only as means of mental
   discipline, but in the enlargement of the sphere of human knowledge,
   and in promoting the refinement and well-being of men. It is admitted
   that theologians are not infallible, in the interpretation of
   Scripture. It may, therefore, happen in the future, as it has in the
   past, that interpretations of the Bible, long confidently received,
   must be modified or abandoned, to bring revelation into harmony with
   what God teaches in his works. This change of view as to the true
   meaning of the Bible may be a painful trial to the Church, but it does
   not in the least impair the authority of the Scriptures. They remain
   infallible; we are merely convicted of having mistaken their meaning.

   § 7. Office of the Senses in Matters of Faith.

   The question, What authority is due to the senses in matters of faith,
   arose out of the controversy between Romanists and Protestants. The
   doctrine of transubstantiation, as taught by the Romish Church,
   contradicts the testimony of our senses of sight, taste, and touch. It
   was natural for Protestants to appeal to this contradiction as decisive
   evidence against the doctrine. Romanists reply by denying the
   competency of the senses to bear testimony in such cases.

   Protestants maintain the validity of that testimony on the following
   grounds: (1.) Confidence in the well-authenticated testimony of our
   senses, is one of those laws of belief which God has impressed upon our
   nature; from the authority of those laws it is impossible that we
   should emancipate ourselves. (2.) Confidence in our senses is,
   therefore, one form of confidence in God. It supposes him to have
   placed us under the necessity of error, to assume that we cannot safely
   trust the guides in which, by a law of our nature, he constrains us to
   confide. (3.) All ground of certainty in matters either of faith or
   knowledge, is destroyed, if confidence in the laws of our nature be
   abandoned. Nothing is then possible but absolute skepticism. We, in
   that case, cannot know that we ourselves exist, or that the world
   exists, or that there is a God, or a moral law, or any responsibility
   for character or conduct. (4.) All external supernatural revelation is
   addressed to the senses. Those who heard Christ had to trust to their
   sense of hearing; those who read the Bible have to trust to their sense
   of sight; those who receive the testimony of the Church, receive it
   through their senses. It is suicidal, therefore, in the Romanists to
   say that the senses are not to be trusted in matters of faith.

   All the arguments derived from the false judgments of men when misled
   by the senses, are answered by the simple statement of the proposition,
   that the senses are to be trusted only within their legitimate sphere.
   The eye may indeed deceive us when the conditions of correct vision are
   not present; but this does not prove that it is not to be trusted
   within its appropriate limits.

CHAPTER IV.

  MYSTICISM.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Meaning of the Words Enthusiasm and Mysticism.

   In the popular sense of the word, enthusiasm means a high state of
   mental excitement. In that state all the powers are exalted, the
   thoughts become more comprehensive and vivid, the feelings more fervid,
   and the will more determined. It is in these periods of excitement that
   the greatest works of genius, whether by poets, painters, or warriors,
   have been accomplished. The ancients referred this exaltation of the
   inner man to a divine influence. They regarded persons thus excited as
   possessed, or having a God within them. Hence they were called
   enthusiasts (entheos). In theology, therefore, those who ignore or
   reject the guidance of the Scriptures, and assume to be led by an
   inward divine influence into the knowledge and obedience of the truth,
   are properly called Enthusiasts. This term, however, has been in a
   great measure superseded by the word Mystics.

   Few words indeed have been used in such a vague, indefinite sense as
   Mysticism. Its etymology does not determine its meaning. A mustes was
   one initiated into the knowledge of the Greek mysteries, one to whom
   secret things had been revealed. Hence in the wide sense of the word, a
   Mystic is one who claims to see or know what is hidden from other men,
   whether this knowledge be attained by immediate intuition, or by inward
   revelation. In most cases these methods were assumed to be identical,
   as intuition was held to be the immediate vision of God and of divine
   things. Hence, in the wide sense of the word, Mystics are those who
   claim to be under the immediate guidance of God or of his Spirit.

   A. The Philosophical Use of the Word.

   Hence Mysticism, in this sense, includes all those systems of
   philosophy, which teach either the identity of God and the soul, or the
   immediate intuition of the infinite. The pantheism of the Brahmins and
   Buddhists, the theosophy of the Sufis, the Egyptian, and many forms of
   the Greek philosophy, in this acceptation of the term, are all
   Mystical. As the same system has been reproduced in modern times, the
   same designation is applied to the philosophy of Spinoza, and its
   various modifications. According to Cousin, "Mysticism in philosophy is
   the belief that God may be known face to face, without anything
   intermediate. It is a yielding to the sentiment awakened by the idea of
   the infinite, and a running up of all knowledge and all duty to the
   contemplation and love of Him." [16]

   For the same reason the whole Alexandrian school of theology in the
   early Church has been called Mystical. They characteristically
   depreciated the outward authority of the Scriptures, and exalted that
   of the inward light. It is true they called that light reason, but they
   regarded it as divine. According to the new Platonic doctrine, the
   Logos, or impersonal reason of God, is Reason in man; or as Clemens
   Alexandrinus said, The Logos was a light common to all men. That,
   therefore, to which supreme authority was ascribed in the pursuit of
   truth, was "God within us." This is the doctrine of modern Eclecticism
   as presented by Cousin. That philosopher says, "Reason is impersonal in
   its nature. It is not we who make it. It is so far from being
   individual, that its peculiar characteristics are the opposite of
   individuality, namely, universality and necessity, since it is to
   Reason we owe the knowledge of universal and necessary truths, of
   principles which we all obey, and cannot but obey. . . . . It descends
   from God, and approaches man. It makes its appearance in the
   consciousness as a guest, who brings intelligence of an unknown world,
   of which it at once presents the idea and awakens the want. If reason
   were personal, it would have no value, no authority beyond the limits
   of the individual subject. . . . . Reason is a revelation, a necessary
   and universal revelation which is wanting to no man, and which
   enlightens every man on his coming into the world. Reason is the
   necessary mediator between God and man, the Logos of Pythagoras and
   Plato, the Word made Flesh, which serves as the interpreter of God, and
   teacher of man, divine and human at the same time. It is not indeed the
   absolute God in his majestic individuality, but his manifestation in
   spirit and in truth. It is not the Being of beings, but it is the
   revealed God of the human race." [17]

   Reason, according to this system, is not a faculty of the human soul,
   but God in man. As electricity and magnetism are (or used to be)
   regarded as forces diffused through the material world, so the Logos,
   the divine impersonal reason, is diffused through the world of mind,
   and reveals itself more or less potentially in the souls of all men.
   This theory, in one aspect, is a form of Rationalism, as it refers all
   our higher, and especially our religious knowledge, to a subjective
   source, which it designates Reason. It has, however, more points of
   analogy with Mysticism, because, (1.) It assumes that the informing
   principle, the source of knowledge and guide in duty, is divine,
   something which does not belong to our nature, but appears as a guest
   in our consciousness. (2.) The office of this inward principle, or
   light, is the same in both systems. It is to reveal truth and duty, to
   elevate and purify the soul. (3.) Its authority is the same; that is,
   it is paramount if not exclusive. (4.) Its very designations are the
   same. It is called by philosophers, God, the Logos, the Word; by
   Christians, Christ within us, or, the Spirit. Thus systems apparently
   the most diverse (Cousin and George Fox!) run into each other, and
   reveal themselves as reproductions of heathen philosophy, or of the
   heresies of the early Church.

   Although the Alexandrian theologians had these points of agreement with
   the Mystics, yet as they were speculative in their whole tendency, and
   strove to transmute Christianity into a philosophy, they are not
   properly to be regarded as Mystics in the generally received
   theological meaning of the term.

   B. The Sense in which Evangelical Christians are called Mystics.

   As all Evangelical Christians admit a supernatural influence of the
   Spirit of God upon the soul, and recognize a higher form of knowledge,
   holiness, and fellowship with God, as the effects of that influence,
   they are stigmatized as Mystics, by those who discard everything
   supernatural from Christianity. The definitions of Mysticism given by
   Rationalists are designedly so framed as to include what all
   evangelical Christians hold to be true concerning the illumination,
   teaching, and guidance of the Holy Spirit. Thus Wegscheider [18] says,
   "Mysticismus est persuasio de singulari animæ facultate ad immediatum
   ipsoque sensu percipiendum cum numine aut naturis coelestibus
   commercium jam in hac vita perveniendi, quo mens immediate cognitione
   rerum divinarum ac beatitate perfruatur." And Bretschneider [19]
   defines Mysticism as a "Belief in a continuous operation of God on the
   soul, secured by special religious exercise, producing illumination,
   holiness, and beatitude." Evangelical theologians so far acquiesce in
   this view, that they say, as Lange, [20] and Nitsch, [21] "that every
   true believer is a Mystic." The latter writer adds, "That the Christian
   ideas of illumination, revelation, incarnation, regeneration, the
   sacraments and the resurrection, are essentially Mystical elements. As
   often as the religious and church-life recovers itself from formalism
   and scholastic barrenness, and is truly revived, it always appears as
   Mystical, and gives rise to the outcry that Mysticism is gaining the
   ascendency." Some writers, indeed, make a distinction between Mystik
   and Mysticismus. "Die innerliche Lebendigkeit der Religion ist allezeit
   Mystik" (The inward vitality of religion is ever Mystik), says Nitsch,
   but "Mysticismus ist eine einseitige Herrschaft und eine Ausartung der
   mystischen Richtung." That is, Mysticism is an undue and perverted
   development of the mystical element which belongs to true religion.
   This distinction, between Mystik and Mysticismus, is not generally
   recognized, and cannot be well expressed in English. Lange, instead of
   using different words, speaks of a true and false Mysticism. But
   different things should be designated by different words. There has
   been a religious theory, which has more or less extensively prevailed
   in the Church, which is distinguished from the Scriptural doctrine by
   unmistakable characteristics, and which is known in church history as
   Mysticism, and the word should be restricted to that theory. It is the
   theory, variously modified, that the knowledge, purity, and blessedness
   to be derived from communion with God, are not to be attained from the
   Scriptures and the use of the ordinary means of grace, but by a
   supernatural and immediate divine influence, which influence (or
   communication of God to the soul) is to be secured by passivity, a
   simple yielding the soul without thought or effort to the divine
   influx.

   C. The System which makes the Feelings the Source of Knowledge.

   A still wider use of the word Mysticism has to some extent been
   adopted. Any system, whether in philosophy or religion, which assigns
   more importance to the feelings than to the intellect, is called
   Mystical. Cousin, and after him, Morell, arrange the systems of
   philosophy under the heads of Sensationalism, Idealism, Skepticism, and
   Mysticism. The first makes the senses the exclusive or predominant
   source of our knowledge; the second, the self, in its constitution and
   laws, as understood and apprehended by the intellect; and Mysticism,
   the feelings. The Mystic assumes that the senses and reason are alike
   untrustworthy and inadequate, as sources of knowledge; that nothing can
   be received with confidence as truth, at least in the higher
   departments of knowledge, in all that relates to our own nature, to
   God, and our relation to Him, except what is revealed either naturally
   or supernaturally in the feelings. There are two forms of Mysticism,
   therefore: the one which assumes the feelings themselves to be the
   sources of this knowledge; the other that it is through the feelings
   that God makes the truth known to the soul. [22] "Reason is no longer
   viewed as the great organ of truth; its decisions are enstamped as
   uncertain, faulty, and well-nigh valueless, while the inward impulses
   of our sensibility, developing themselves in the form of faith or of
   inspiration, are held up as the true and infallible source of human
   knowledge. The fundamental process, therefore, of all Mysticism, is to
   reverse the true order of nature, and give the precedence to the
   emotional instead of the intellectual element of the human mind." [23]
   This is declared to be "the common ground of all Mysticism."

   Schleiermacher's Theory.

   If this be a correct view of the nature of Mysticism; if it consists in
   giving predominant authority to the feelings in matters of religion;
   and if their impulses, developing themselves in the form of faith, are
   the true and infallible source of knowledge, then Schleiermacher's
   system, adopted and expounded by Morell himself in his "Philosophy of
   Religion," is the most elaborate system of theology ever presented to
   the Church. It is the fundamental principle of Schleiermacher's theory,
   that religion resides not in the intelligence, or the will or active
   powers, but in the sensibility. It is a form of feeling, a sense of
   absolute dependence. Instead of being, as we seem to be, individual,
   separate free agents, originating our own acts, we recognize ourselves
   as a part of a great whole, determined in all things by the great
   whole, of which we are a part. We find ourselves as finite creatures
   over against an infinite Being, in relation to whom we are as nothing.
   The Infinite is everything; and everything is only a manifestation of
   the Infinite. "Although man," says even Morell, "while in the midst of
   finite objects, always feels himself to a certain extent free and
   independent; yet in the presence of that which is self-existent,
   infinite, and eternal, he may feel the sense of freedom utterly pass
   away, and become absorbed in the sense of absolute dependence." [24]
   This is said to be the essential principle of religion in all its forms
   from Fetichism up to Christianity. It depends mainly on the degree of
   culture of the individual or community, in what way this sense of
   dependence shall reveal itself: because the more enlightened and pure
   the individual is, the more he will be able to apprehend aright what is
   involved in this sense of dependence upon God. Revelation is not the
   communication of new truth to the understanding, but the providential
   influences by which the religious life is awakened in the soul.
   Inspiration is not the divine influence which controls the mental
   operations and utterances of its subject, so as to render him
   infallible in the communication of the truth revealed, but simply the
   intuition of eternal verities due to the excited state of the religious
   feelings. Christianity, subjectively considered, is the intuitions of
   good men, as occasioned and determined by the appearance of Christ.
   Objectively considered, or, in other words, Christian theology, it is
   the logical analysis, and scientific arrangement and elucidation of the
   truths involved in those intuitions. The Scriptures, as a rule of
   faith, have no authority. They are of value only as means of awakening
   in us the religious life experienced by the Apostles, and thus enabling
   us to attain like intuitions of divine things. The source of our
   religious life, according to this system, is the feelings, and if this
   be the characteristic feature of Mysticism, the Schleiermacher doctrine
   is purely Mystical.

   D. Mysticism as known in Church History.

   This, however, is not what is meant by Mysticism, as it has appeared in
   the Christian Church. The Mystics, as already stated, are those who
   claim an immediate communication of divine knowledge and of divine life
   from God to the soul, independently of the Scriptures and the use of
   the ordinary means of grace. "It despairs," says Fleming, "of the
   regular process of science; it believes that we may attain directly,
   without the aid of the senses or reason, and by an immediate intuition,
   the real and absolute principle of all truth, -- God." [25]

   Mystics are of two classes; the Theosophists, whose object is
   knowledge, and with whom the organ of communication with God, is the
   reason; and the Mystics proper, whose object is, life, purity, and
   beatitude; and with whom the organ of communication, or receptivity, is
   the feelings. They agree, first, in relying on the immediate revelation
   or communication of God to the soul; and secondly, that these
   communications are to be attained, in the neglect of outward means, by
   quiet or passive contemplation. "The Theosophist is one who gives a
   theory of God, or of the works of God, which has not reason, but an
   inspiration of his own for its basis." [26] "The Theosophists, neither
   contented with the natural light of reason, nor with the simple
   doctrines of Scripture understood in their literal sense, have recourse
   to an internal supernatural light superior to all other illuminations,
   from which they profess to derive a mysterious and divine philosophy
   manifested only to the chosen favorites of heaven." [27]

   Mysticism not identical with the Doctrine of Spiritual Illumination.

   Mysticism, then, is not to be confounded with the doctrine of spiritual
   illumination as held by all evangelical Christians. The Scriptures
   clearly teach that the mere outward presentation of the truth in the
   Word, does not suffice to the conversion or sanctification of men; that
   the natural, or unrenewed man, does not receive the things of the
   Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know
   them; that in order to any saving knowledge of the truth, i.e., of such
   knowledge as produces holy affections and secures a holy life, there is
   need of an inward supernatural teaching of the Spirit, producing what
   the Scriptures call "spiritual discernment," This supernatural teaching
   our Lord promised to his disciples when He said that He would send them
   the Spirit of truth to dwell in them, and to guide them into the
   knowledge of the truth. For this teaching the sacred writers pray that
   it may be granted not to themselves only, but to all who heard their
   words or read their writings. On this they depended exclusively for
   their success in preaching or teaching. Hence believers were designated
   as pneumatikoi, a Spiritu Dei illuminati, qui reguntur a Spiritu. And
   men of the world, unrenewed men, are described as those who have not
   the Spirit. God, therefore, does hold immediate intercourse with the
   souls of men. He reveals himself unto his people, as He does not unto
   the world. He gives them the Spirit of revelation in the knowledge of
   himself. (Eph. i. 17.) He unfolds to them his glory, and fills them
   with a joy which passes understanding. All this is admitted; but this
   is very different from Mysticism. The two things, namely, spiritual
   illumination and Mysticism, differ, firstly, as to their object. The
   object of the inward teaching of the Spirit is to enable us to discern
   the truth and excellence of what is already objectively revealed in the
   Bible. The illumination claimed by the Mystic communicates truth
   independently of its objective revelation. It is not intended to enable
   us to appreciate what we already know, but to communicate new
   knowledge. It would be one thing to enable man to discern and
   appreciate the beauty of a work of art placed before his eyes, and
   quite another thing to give him the intuition of all possible forms of
   truth and beauty, independent of everything external. So there is a
   great difference between that influence which enables the soul to
   discern the things "freely given to us of God" (1 Cor. ii. 12) in his
   Word, and the immediate revelation to the mind of all the contents of
   that word, or of their equivalents.

   The doctrines of spiritual illumination and of Mysticism differ not
   only in the object, but secondly, in the manner in which that object is
   to be attained. The inward teaching of the Spirit is to be sought by
   prayer, and the diligent use of the appointed means; the intuitions of
   the Mystic are sought in the neglect of all means, in the suppression
   of all activity inward and outward, and in a passive waiting for the
   influx of God into the soul. They differ, thirdly, in their effects.
   The effect of spiritual illumination is, that the Word dwells in us "in
   all wisdom and spiritual understanding" (Col. i. 9). What dwells in the
   mind of the Mystic are his own imaginings, the character of which
   depends on his own subjective state; and whatever they are, they are of
   man and not of God.

   It differs from the Doctrine of the "Leading of the Spirit."

   Neither is Mysticism to be confounded with the doctrine of spiritual
   guidance. Evangelical Christians admit that the children of God are led
   by the Spirit of God; that their convictions as to truth and duty,
   their inward character and outward conduct, are moulded by his
   influence. They are children unable to guide themselves, who are led by
   an ever-present Father of infinite wisdom and love. This guidance is
   partly providential, ordering their external circumstances; partly
   through the Word, which is a lamp to their feet; and partly by the
   inward influence of the Spirit on the mind. This last, however, is also
   through the Word, making it intelligible and effectual; bringing it
   suitably to remembrance. God leads his people by the cords of a man,
   i.e., in accordance with the laws of his nature. This is very different
   from the doctrine that the soul, by yielding itself passively to God,
   is filled with all truth and goodness; or, that in special emergencies
   it is controlled by blind, irrational impulses.

   It differs from the Doctrine of "Common Grace."

   Finally, Mysticism differs from the doctrine of common graces as held
   by all Augustinians, and that of sufficient grace as held by Arminians.
   All Christians believe that as God is everywhere present in the
   material world, guiding the operation of second causes so that they
   secure the results which He designs; so his Spirit is everywhere
   present with the minds of men, exciting to good and restraining from
   evil, effectually controlling human character and conduct, consistently
   with the laws of rational beings. According to the Arminian theory this
   "common grace" is sufficient, if properly cultured and obeyed, to lead
   men to salvation, whether Pagans, Mohammedans, or Christians. There is
   little analogy, however, between this doctrine of common, or sufficient
   grace, and Mysticism as it has revealed itself in the history of the
   Church. The one assumes an influence of the Spirit on all men analogous
   to the providential efficiency of God in nature, the other an influence
   analogous to that granted to prophets and apostles, involving both
   revelation and inspiration.

   § 2. Mysticism in the Early Church.

   A. Montanism.

   The Montanists who arose toward the close of the second century had, in
   one aspect, some affinity to Mysticism. Montanus taught that as the
   ancient prophets predicted the coming of the Messiah through whom new
   revelations were to be made; so Christ predicted the coming of the
   Paraclete through whom further communications of the mind of God were
   to be made to his people. Tertullian, by whom this system was reduced
   to order and commended to the higher class of minds, did indeed
   maintain that the rule of faith was fixed and immutable; but
   nevertheless that there was need of a continued supernatural revelation
   of truth, at least as to matters of duty and discipline. This
   supernatural revelation was made through the Paraclete; whether, as was
   perhaps the general idea among the Montanists, by communications
   granted, from lime to time, to special individuals, who thereby became
   Christian prophets; or by an influence common to all believers, which
   however some more than others experienced and improved. The following
   passage from Tertullian [28] gives clearly the fundamental principle of
   the system, so far as this point is concerned: "Regula quidem fidei una
   omnino est, sola immobilis et irreformabilis. . . . . Hac lege fidei
   manente, cetera jam disciplinæ et conversationis admittunt novitatem
   correctionis; operante scilicet et proficiente usque in finem gratia
   Dei. . . . . Propterea Paracletum misit Dominus, ut, quoniam humana
   mediocritas omnia semel capere non poterat, paulatim dirigeretur et
   ordinaretur et ad perfectum perduceretur disciplina ab illo vicario
   Domini Spiritu Sancto. Quæ est ergo Paracleti administratio nisi hæc,
   quod disciplina dirigitur, quod Scripturæ revelantur, quod intellectus
   reformatur, quod ad meliora proficitur? . . . . Justitia primo fuit in
   rudimentis, natura Deum metuens; dehinc per legem et prophetas promovit
   in infantiam; dehinc per evangelium efferbuit in juventutem; nunc per
   Paracletum componitur in maturitatem."

   The points of analogy between Montanism and Mysticism are that both
   assume the insufficiency of the Scriptures and the ordinances of the
   Church for the full development of the Christian life; and both assert
   the necessity of a continued, supernatural, revelation from the Spirit
   of God. In other respects the two tendencies were divergent. Mysticism
   was directed to the inner life; Montanism to the outward. It concerned
   itself with the reformation of manners and strictness of discipline. It
   enjoined fasts, and other ascetic practices. As it depended on the
   supernatural and continued guidance of the Spirit, it was on the one
   hand opposed to speculation, or the attempt to develop Christianity by
   philosophy; and on the other to the dominant authority of the bishops.
   Its denunciatory and exclusive spirit led to its condemnation as
   heretical. As the Montanists excommunicated the Church, the Church
   excommunicated them. [29]

   B. The so-called Dionysius, the Areopagite.

   Mysticism, in the common acceptation of the term, is antagonistic to
   speculation. And yet they are often united. There have been speculative
   or philosophical Mystics. The father indeed of Mysticism in the
   Christian Church, was a philosopher. About the year A.D. 523, during
   the Monothelite controversy certain writings were quoted as of
   authority as being the productions of Dionysius the Areopagite. The
   total silence respecting them during the preceding centuries; the
   philosophical views which they express; the allusions to the state of
   the Church with which they abound, have produced the conviction,
   universally entertained, that they were the work of some author who
   lived in the latter part of the fifth century. The most learned
   investigators, however, confess their inability to fix with certainty
   or even with probability on any writer to whom they can be referred.
   Though their authorship is unknown, their influence has been
   confessedly great. The works which bear the pseudonym of Dionysius are,
   "The Celestial Hierarchy," "The Terrestrial Hierarchy," "Mystical
   Theology," and "Twelve Epistles." Their contents show that their author
   belonged to the school of the New Platonists, and that his object was
   to propagate the peculiar views of that school in the Christian Church.
   The writer attempts to show that the real, esoteric doctrines of
   Christianity are identical with those of his own school of philosophy.
   In other words, he taught New Platonism, in the terminology of the
   Church. Christian ideas were entirely excluded, while the language of
   the Bible was retained. Thus in our day we have had the philosophy of
   Schelling and Hegel set forth in the formulas of Christian theology.

   New Platonism.

   The New Platonists taught that the original ground and source of all
   things was simple being, without life or consciousness; of which
   absolutely nothing could be known, beyond that it is. They assumed an
   unknown quantity, of which nothing can be predicated. The
   pseudo-Dionysius called this original ground of all things God, and
   taught that God was mere being without attributes of any kind, not only
   unknowable by man, but of whom there was nothing to be known, as
   absolute being is in the language of the modern philosophy, -- Nothing;
   nothing in itself, yet nevertheless the dunamis ton panton.

   The universe proceeds from primal being, not by any exercise of
   conscious power or will, but by a process or emanation. The familiar
   illustration is derived from the flow of light from the sun. With this
   difference, however. That the sun emits light, is a proof that it is
   itself luminous but the fact that intelligent beings emanate from the
   "ground-being," is not admitted as proof that it is intelligent. The
   fact that the air produces cheerfulness, say these philosophers, does
   not prove that the atmosphere experiences joy. We can infer nothing as
   to the nature of the cause from the nature of the effects.

   These emanations are of different orders; decreasing in dignity and
   excellence as they are distant from the primal source. The first of
   these emanations is mind, nous, intelligence individualized in
   different ranks of spiritual beings. The next, proceeding from the
   first, is soul, which becomes individualized by organic or vital
   connection with matter. There is, therefore, an intelligence of
   intelligences, and also a soul of souls; hence their generic unity.
   Evil arises from the connection of the spiritual with the corporeal,
   and yet this connection so far as souls are concerned, is necessary to
   their individuality. Every soul, therefore, is an emanation from the
   soul of the world, as that is from God, through the Intelligence.

   As there is no individual soul without a body, and as evil is the
   necessary consequence of union with a body, evil is not only necessary
   or unavoidable, it is a good.

   The end of philosophy is the immediate vision of God, which gives the
   soul supreme blessedness and rest. This union with God is attained by
   sinking into ourselves; by passivity. As we are a form, or mode of
   God's existence, we find God in ourselves, and are consciously one with
   him, when this is really apprehended; or, when we suffer God, as it
   were, to absorb our individuality.

   The primary emanations from the ground of all being, which the heathen
   called gods (as they had gods many and lords many) the New Platonists,
   spirits or intelligences; and the Gnostics, æons; the pseudo-Dionysius
   called angels. These he divided into three triads: (1.) thrones,
   cherubim, and seraphim; (2.) powers, lordships, authorities; (3.)
   angels, archangels, principalities. He classified the ordinances and
   officers and members of the Church into corresponding triads: (1.) The
   sacraments, -- baptism, communion, anointing, -- these were the means
   of initiation or consecration ; (2.) The initiators, -- bishops,
   priests, deacons; (3.) The initiated, -- monks, the baptized,
   catechumens.

   The terms God, sin, redemption, are retained in this system, but the
   meaning attached to them was entirely inconsistent with the sense they
   bear in the Bible and in the Christian Church. The pseudo-Dionysius was
   a heathen philosopher in the vestments of a Christian minister. The
   philosophy which he taught he claimed to be the true sense of the
   doctrines of the Church, as that sense had been handed down by a secret
   tradition. Notwithstanding its heathen origin and character, its
   influence in the Church was great and long continued. The writings of
   its author were translated, annotated and paraphrased, centuries after
   his death. As there is no effect without an adequate cause, there must
   have been power in this system and an adaptation to the cravings of a
   large class of minds.

   Causes of the Influence of the Writings of the pseudo-Dionysius.

   To account for its extensive influence it may be remarked: (1.) That it
   did not openly shock the faith or prejudices of the Church. It did not
   denounce any received doctrine or repudiate any established institution
   or ordinance. It pretended to be Christian. It undertook to give a
   deeper and more correct insight into the mysteries of religion. (2.) It
   subordinated the outward to the inward. Some men are satisfied with
   rites, ceremonies, symbols, which may mean anything or nothing; others,
   with knowledge or clear views of truth. To others, the inner life of
   the soul, intercourse with God, is the great thing. To these this
   system addressed itself. It proposed to satisfy this craving after God,
   not indeed in a legitimate way, or by means of Gods appointment.
   Nevertheless it was the high end of union with him that it proposed,
   and which it professed to secure. (3.) This system was only one form of
   the doctrine which has such a fascination for the human mind, and which
   underlies so many forms of religion in every age of the world; the
   doctrine, namely, that the universe is an efflux of the life of God, --
   all things flowing from him, and back again to him from everlasting to
   everlasting. This doctrine quiets the conscience, as it precludes the
   idea of sin; it gives the peace which flows from fatalism; and it
   promises the absolute rest of unconsciousness when the individual is
   absorbed in the bosom of the Infinite. [30]

   § 3. Mysticism during the Middle Ages.

   A. General Characteristics of this Period.

   The Middle Ages embrace the period from the close of the sixth century
   to the Reformation. This period is distinguished by three marked
   characteristics. First, the great development of the Latin Church in
   its hierarchy, its worship, and its formulated doctrines, as well as in
   its superstitions, corruptions, and power. Secondly, the extraordinary
   intellectual activity awakened in the region of speculation, as
   manifested in the multiplication of seats of learning, in the number
   and celebrity of their teachers, and in the great multitude of students
   by which they were attended, and in the interest taken by all classes
   in the subjects of learned discussion. Thirdly, by a widespread and
   variously manifested movement of, so to speak, the inner life of the
   Church, protesting against the formalism, the corruption, and the
   tyranny of the external Church. This protest was made partly openly by
   those whom Protestants are wont to call "Witnesses for the Truth;" and
   partly within the Church itself. The opposition within the Church
   manifested itself partly among the people, in the formation of
   fellowships or societies for benevolent effort and spiritual culture,
   such as the Beguines, the Beghards, the Lollards, and afterwards, "The
   Brethren of the Common Lot;" and partly in the schools, or by the
   teachings of theologians.

   It was the avowed aim of the theologians of this period to justify the
   doctrines of the Church at the bar of reason; to prove that what was
   received on authority as a matter of faith, was true as a matter of
   philosophy. It was held to be the duty of the theologian to exalt faith
   into knowledge. Or, as Anselm [31] expresses it: "rationabili
   necessitate intelligere, esse oportere omnia illa, quæ nobis fides
   catholica de Christo credere præcipit." Richard à St. Victore still
   more strongly asserts that we are bound, "quod tenemus ex fide, ratione
   apprehendere et demonstrativæ certitudinis attestatione firmare."

   The First Class of Mediæval Theologians.

   Of these theologians, however, there were three classes. First, those
   who avowedly exalted reason above authority, and refused to receive
   anything on authority which they could not for themselves, on rational
   grounds, prove to be true. John Scotus Erigena (Eringeborne,
   Irish-born) may be taken as a representative of this class. He not only
   held, that reason and revelation, philosophy and religion, are
   perfectly consistent, but that religion and philosophy are identical.
   "Conficitur," he says, "inde veram philosophiam esse veram religionem
   conversimque veram religionem esse veram philosophiam." [32] And on the
   crucial question, Whether faith precedes science, or science faith, he
   decided for the latter. Reason, with him, was paramount to authority,
   the latter having no force except when sustained by the former.
   "Auctoritas siquidem ex vera ratione processit, ratio vero nequaquam ex
   auctoritate. Omnis autem auctoritas, quæ vera ratione non approbatur,
   infirma videtur esse. Vera autem ratio, quum virtutibus suis rata atque
   immutabilis munitur, nullius auctoritatis adstipulatione roborari
   indiget." [33] His philosophy as developed in his work, "De Divisione
   Naturæ," is purely pantheistic. There is with him but one being, and
   everything real is thought. His system, therefore, is nearly identical
   with the idealistic pantheism of Hegel; yet he had his trinitarianism,
   his soteriology, and his eschatology, as a theologian.

   The Second Class.

   The second and more numerous class of the mediæval theologians took the
   ground that faith in matters of religion precedes science; that truths
   are revealed to us supernaturally by the Spirit of God, which truths
   are to be received on the authority of the Scriptures and the testimony
   of the Church. But being believed, then we should endeavor to
   comprehend and to prove them; so that our conviction of their truth
   should rest on rational grounds. It is very evident that everything
   depends on the spirit with which this principle is applied, and on the
   extent to which it is carried. In the hands of many of the schoolmen,
   as of the Fathers, it was merely a form of rationalism. Many taught
   that while Christianity was to be received by the people on authority
   as a matter of faith, it was to be received by the cultivated as a
   matter of knowledge. The human was substituted for the divine, the
   authority of reason for the testimony of God. With the better class of
   the schoolmen the principle in question was held with many limitations.
   Anselm, for example taught: (1.) That holiness of heart is the
   essential condition of true knowledge. It is only so far as the truths
   of religion enter into our personal experience, that we are able
   properly to apprehend them. Faith, therefore, as including spiritual
   discernment, must precede all true knowledge. "Qui secundum carnem
   vivit, carnalis sive animalis est, de quo dicitur: animalis homo non
   percipit ea, quæ sunt Spiritus Dei. . . . . Qui non crediderit, non
   intelliget, nam qui non crediderit, non experietur, et qui expertus non
   fuerit, non intelliget." [34] "Neque enim quæro intelligere, ut credam,
   sed credo, ut intelligam. Nam et hoc credo, quia, nisi credidero, non
   intelligam." [35] (2.) He held that rational proof was not needed as a
   help to faith. It was as absurd, he said, for us to presume to add
   authority to the testimony of God by our reasoning, as for a man to
   prop up Olympus. (3.) He taught that there are doctrines of revelation
   which transcend our reason, which we cannot rationally pretend to
   comprehend or prove, and which are to be received on the simple
   testimony of God. "Nam Christianus per fidem debet ad intellectum
   proficere, non per intellectum ad fidem accedere, aut si intelligere
   non valet, a fide recedere. Sed cum ad intellectum valet pertingere,
   delectatur, cum vero nequit, quod capere non potest, veneratur." [36]

   A third class of the schoolmen, while professing to adhere to the
   doctrines of the Church, consciously or unconsciously, explained them
   away.

   B. Mediæval Mystics..

   Mystics were to be found in all these classes, and therefore they have
   been divided, as by Dr. Shedd, [37] into the heretical, the orthodox,
   and an intermediate class, which he designates as latitudinarian. Much
   to the same effect, Neudecker, [38] classifies them as Theosophist,
   Evangelical, and Separatist. Ullmann [39] makes a somewhat different
   classification. The characteristic common to these classes, which
   differed so much from each other, was not that in all there was a
   protest of the heart against the head, of the feelings against the
   intellect, a reaction against the subtleties of the scholastic
   theologians, for some of the leading Mystics were among the most subtle
   dialecticians. Nor was it a common adherence to the Platonic as opposed
   to the Aristotelian philosophy, or to realism as opposed to nominalism.
   But it was the belief, that oneness with God was the great end to be
   desired and pursued, and that that union was to be sought, not so much
   through the truth, or the Church, or ordinances, or Christian
   fellowship; but by introspection, meditation, intuition. As very
   different views were entertained of the nature of the "oneness with
   God," which was to be sought, so the Mystics differed greatly from each
   other. Some were extreme pantheists; others were devout theists and
   Christians. From its essential nature, however, the tendency of
   Mysticism was to pantheism. And accordingly undisguised pantheism was
   not only taught by some of the most prominent Mystics, but prevailed
   extensively among the people.

   Pantheistic tendency of Mysticism.

   It has already been remarked, that the system of the pseudo-Dionysius,
   as presented in his "Mystical Theology" and other writings, was
   essentially pantheistic. Those writings were translated by Scotus
   Erigena, himself the most pronounced pantheist of the Middle Ages.
   Through the joint influence of these two men, a strong tendency to
   pantheism was developed to a greater or less degree among the mediæval
   Mystics. Even the associations among the people, such as the Beghards
   and Lollards, although at first exemplary and useful, by adopting a
   system of mystic pantheism became entirely corrupt. [40] Believing
   themselves to be modes of the divine existence, all they did God did,
   and all they felt inclined to do was an impulse from God, and therefore
   nothing could be wrong. In our own day the same principles have led to
   the same consequences in one wing of the German school of philosophy.

   It was not only among the people and in these secret fellowships that
   this system was adopted. Men of the highest rank in the schools, and
   personally exemplary in their deportment, became the advocates of the
   theory which lay at the foundation of these practical evils. Of these
   scholastic pantheistical Mystics, the most distinguished and
   influential was Henry Eckart, whom some modern writers regard "as the
   deepest thinker of his age, if not of any age." Neither the time nor
   the place of his birth is known. He first appears in Paris as a
   Dominican monk and teacher. In 1304 he was Provincial of the Dominicans
   in Saxony. Soon after he was active in Strasburg as a preacher. His
   doctrines were condemned as heretical, although he denied that he had
   in any respect departed from the doctrines of the Church. From the
   decision of his archbishop and his provincial council, Eckart appealed
   to the Pope, by whom the sentence of condemnation was confirmed. This
   decision, however, was not published until 1329, when Eckart was
   already dead. It is not necessary here to give the details of his
   system. Suffice it to say, that he held that God is the only being;
   that the universe is the self-manifestation of God; that the highest
   destiny of man is to come to the consciousness of his identity with
   God; that that end is to be accomplished partly by philosophical
   abstraction and partly by ascetic self renunciation.

   "Although union with God is effected mainly by thinking and
   consciousness, still it also requires a corresponding act of the will,
   something practical, such as self-denial and privation, by which man
   rises above all that is finite. Not only must he lay aside all created
   things, the world and earthly good, and mortify desire, but more than
   all he must resign his I,' reduce himself to nothing, and become what
   he was before he issued forth into this temporal state. Nay, man must
   rise above the chief good, above virtue, piety, blessedness, and God
   himself, as things external and superior to his spirit, and it is only
   when he has thus annihilated self, and all that is not God within him,
   that nothing remains except the pure and simple divine essence, in
   which all division is brought into absolute unity." [41]

   Another distinguished and influential writer of the same class was John
   Ruysbroek, born 1293, in a village of that name not far from Brussels.
   Having entered the service of the Church he devoted himself to the
   duties of a secular priest until his sixtieth year, when he became
   prior of a newly instituted monastery. He was active and faithful,
   gentle and devout. Whether he was a theist or a pantheist is a matter
   of dispute. His speculative views were formed more or less under the
   influence of the writings of the pseudo-Dionysius and of Eckart.
   Gerson, himself a Mystic, objected to his doctrines as pantheistic; and
   every one acknowledges that there are not only forms of expression but
   also principles to be found in his writings which imply the pantheistic
   theory. He speaks of God as the super-essential being including all
   beings. All creatures, he taught, were in God, as thoughts before their
   creation. "God saw and recognized them in himself, as somehow, but not
   wholly, different from himself, for what is in God, is God." "In the
   act of self-depletion, the spirit loses itself in the enjoyment of
   love, and imbibes directly the brightness of God, yea, becomes the very
   brightness which it imbibes. All who are raised to the sublimity of
   this contemplative life are one with deifying (deifica) brightness, and
   become one and the same light as that which they behold. To such a
   height is the spirit elevated above itself, and made one with God, in
   respect that in the oneness of that living original in which, according
   to its uncreated being, it possesses itself, it enjoys and contemplates
   boundless treasures in the same manner as God himself." Ullmann, who
   quotes these and similar passages, still maintains that Ruysbroek was a
   theist, because, as he says, Ruysbroek "distinctly recognizes not only
   the immanence of God, but what no pantheist can do, his transcendence."
   Moreover, he "too frequently and too solicitously avers that, in the
   oneness of the contemplative man with God, he still recognizes a
   difference between the two, to permit us to ascribe to him the doctrine
   of an absolute solution of the individual into the Divine substance."
   [42] A man may aver a difference between the waves and the ocean,
   between the leaves and the tree, and yet in both cases assert a
   substantial unity. It is true that no one can intelligently affirm the
   transcendence of God, and still hold the extreme form of pantheism
   which makes the world the existence-form of God, his whole
   intelligence, power, and life. But he may be a Monist. He may believe
   that there is but one Being in the universe, that everything is a form
   of God, and all life the life of God. Pantheism is Protean. Some
   moderns speak of a Christian Pantheism. But any system which hinders
   our saying "Thou," to God, is fatal to religion.

   Evangelical Mystics.

   Bernard of Clairvaux, Hugo and Richard of St. Victor, Gersorn, Thomas à
   Kempis and others, are commonly referred to the class of evangelical
   Mystics. These eminent and influential men differed much from each
   other, but they all held union within God, not in the Scriptural, but
   in the mystical sense of that term, as the great object of desire. It
   was not that they held that "the beatific vision of God," the intuition
   of his glory, which belongs to heaven, is attainable in this world and
   attainable by abstraction, ecstatic apprehension, or passive reception,
   but that the soul becomes one with God, if not in substance, yet in
   life. These men, however, were great blessings to the Church. Their
   influence was directed to the preservation of the inward life of
   religion in opposition to the formality and ritualism which then
   prevailed in the Church; and thus to free the conscience from
   subjection to human authority. The writings of Bernard are still held
   in high esteem, and "The Imitation of Christ," by Thomas à Kempis, has
   diffused itself like incense through all the aisles and alcoves of the
   Universal Church. [43]

   4. Mysticism at, and after the Reformation.

   A. Effect of the Reformation on the Popular Mind.

   Such a great and general movement of the public mind as occurred during
   the sixteenth century, when the old foundations of doctrine and order
   in the Church, were overturned, could hardly fail to be attended by
   irregularities and extravagancies in the inward and outward life of the
   people. There are two principles advanced, both Scriptural and both of
   the last importance, which are specially liable to abuse in times of
   popular excitement.

   The first is, the right of private judgment. This, as understood by the
   Reformers, is the right of every man to decide what a revelation made
   by God to him, requires him to believe. It was a protest against the
   authority assumed by the Church (i.e. the Bishops), of deciding for the
   people what they were to believe. It was very natural that the
   fanatical, in rejecting the authority of the Church, should reject all
   external authority in matters of religion. They understood by the right
   of private judgment, the right of every man to determine what he should
   believe from the operations of his own mind and from his own inward
   experience, independently of the Scriptures. But as it is palpably
   absurd to expect, on such a subject as religion, a certainty either
   satisfactory to ourselves or authoritative for others, from our own
   reason or feelings, it was inevitable that these subjective convictions
   should be referred to a supernatural source. Private revelations, an
   inward light, the testimony of the Spirit, came to be exalted over the
   authority of the Bible.

   Secondly, the Reformers taught that religion is a matter of the heart,
   that a man's acceptance with God does not depend on his membership in
   any external society, on obedience to its officers, and on sedulous
   observance of its rites and ordinances; but on the regeneration of his
   heart, and his personal faith in the Son of God, manifesting itself in
   a holy life. This was a protest against the fundamental principle of
   Romanism, that all within the external organization which Romanists
   call the Church, are saved, and all out of it are lost. It is not a
   matter of surprise that evil men should wrest this principle, as they
   do all other truths, to their own destruction. Because religion does
   not consist in externals, many rushed to the conclusion that externals,
   -- the Church, its ordinances, its officers, its worship, -- were of no
   account. These principles were soon applied beyond the sphere of
   religion. Those who regarded them themselves as the organs of God,
   emancipated from the authority of the Bible and exalted above the
   Church, came to claim exemption from the authority of the State. To
   this outbreak the grievous and long-continued oppression of the
   peasantry greatly contributed, so that this spirit of fanaticism and
   revolt rapidly spread over all Germany, and into Switzerland and
   Holland.

   The Popular Disorders not the Effects of the Reformation.

   The extent to which these disorders spread, and the rapidity with which
   they diffused themselves, show that they were not the mere outgrowth of
   the Reformation. The principles avowed by the Reformers, and the
   relaxation of papal authority occasioned by the Reformation, served but
   to inflame the elements which had for years been slumbering in the
   minds of the people. The innumerous associations and fellowships, of
   which mention was made in the preceding section, had leavened the
   public mind with the principles of pantheistic Mysticism, which were
   the prolific source of evil. Men who imagined themselves to be forms in
   which God existed and acted, were not likely to be subject to any
   authority human or divine, nor were they apt to regard anything as
   sinful which they felt inclined to do.

   These men also had been brought up under the Papacy. According to the
   papal theory, especially as it prevailed during the Middle Ages, the
   Church was a theocracy, whose representatives were the subjects of a
   constant inspiration rendering them infallible as teachers and absolute
   as rulers. All who opposed the Church were rebels against God, whom to
   destroy was a duty both to God and man. These ideas Münzer and his
   followers applied to themselves. They were the true Church. They were
   inspired. They were entitled to determine what is true in matters of
   doctrine. They were entitled to rule with absolute authority in church
   and state. All who opposed them, opposed God, and ought to be
   exterminated. Münzer died upon the scaffold: thus was fulfilled anew
   our Lord's declaration, "Those who take the sword, shall perish by the
   sword."

   B. Mystics among the Reformers.

   Few of the theologians contemporary with Luther took any part in this
   fanatical movement. To a certain extent this however was done by
   Carlstadt (Bodenstein), archdeacon and afterwards professor of theology
   at Wittenberg. At first he cooperated zealously with the great
   Reformer, but when Storch and Stübener claiming to be prophets, came to
   Wittenberg during Luther's confinement at Wartburg, and denounced
   learning and Church institutions, and taught that all reliance was to
   be placed on the inward light, or supernatural guidance of the Spirit,
   Carlstadt gave them his support and exhorted the students to abandon
   their studies and to betake themselves to manual labor. Great disorder
   following these movements, Luther left his place of seclusion, appeared
   upon the scene, and succeeded in allaying the tumult. Carlstadt then
   withdrew from Wittenberg, and ultimately united himself with
   Schwenkfeld, a more influential opponent of Luther and who was equally
   imbued with the spirit of Mysticism.

   Sckwenkfeld.

   Schwenkfeld, a nobleman born 1490, in the principality of Lignitz, in
   Lower Silesia, was a man of great energy and force of character,
   exemplary in his conduct, of extensive learning and indefatigable
   diligence. He at first took an active part in promoting the
   Reformation, and was on friendly terms with Luther, Melancthon, and the
   other leading Reformers. Being a man not only of an independent way of
   thinking, but confident and zealous in maintaining his peculiar
   opinions, he soon separated himself from other Protestants and passed
   his whole life in controversy; condemned by synods and proscribed by
   the civil authorities, he was driven from city to city, until his
   death, which occurred in 1561.

   That Schwenkfeld differed not only from the Romanists, but from
   Lutherans and Reformed on all the great doctrines then in controversy,
   is to be referred to the fact that he held, in common with the great
   body of the Mystics of the Middle Ages, that union or oneness with God,
   not in nature or character only, but also in being or substance, was
   the one great desideratum and essential condition of holiness and
   felicity. To avoid the pantheistic doctrines into which the majority of
   the Mystics were led, he held to a form of dualism. Creatures exist out
   of God, and are due to the exercise of his power. In them there is
   nothing of the substance of God, and therefore nothing really good.
   With regard to men, they are made good and blessed by communicating to
   them the substance of God. This communication is made through Christ.
   Christ is not, even as to his human nature, a creature. His body and
   soul were formed out of the substance of God. While on earth, in his
   state of humiliation, this substantial unity of his humanity with God,
   was undeveloped and unrevealed. Since his exaltation it is completely
   deified, or lost in the divine essence. It followed from these
   principles, First, That the external church, with its ordinances and
   means of grace, was of little importance. Especially that the
   Scriptures are not, even instrumentally, the source of the divine life.
   Faith does not come by hearing, but from the Christ within; i.e. from
   the living substance of God communicated to the soul. This
   communication is to be sought by abnegation, renunciation of the
   creature, by contemplation and prayer. Secondly, as to the sacrament of
   the supper, which then was the great subject of controversy,
   Schwenkfeld stood by himself. Not admitting that Christ had any
   material body or blood, he could not admit that the bread and wine were
   transubstantiated into his body and blood, as Romanists teach; nor that
   his body and blood were focally present in the sacrament, in, with, and
   under the bread and wine, as Luther held; nor could he admit the
   dynamic presence of Christ's body, as taught by Calvin; nor that the
   Lord's Supper was merely a significant and commemorative ordinance, as
   Zwingle taught. He held his own doctrine. He transposed the words of
   Christ. Instead of "This (bread) is my body," he said, the true meaning
   and intent of Christ was, "My body is bread;" that is, as bread is the
   staff and source of life to the body, so my body, formed of the essence
   of God, is the life of the soul.

   A third inference from Schwenkfeld's fundamental principle was that the
   redemption of the soul is purely subjective; something wrought in the
   soul itself. He denied justification by faith as Luther taught that
   doctrine, and which Luther regarded as the life of the Church. He said
   that we are justified not by what Christ has done for us, but by what
   He does within us. All we need is the communication of the life or
   substance of Christ to the soul. With him, as with Mystics generally,
   the ideas of guilt and expiation were ignored.

   Later Mystics.

   The succession of mystical writers was kept up by such men as
   Paracelsus, Weigel, Jacob Boehmne, and others. The first named was a
   physician and chemist, who combined natural philosophy and alchemy with
   his theosophy. He was born in 1493 and died in 1541. Weigel, a pastor,
   was born in Saxony in 1533, and died in 1588. His views were formed
   under the influence of Tauler, Schwenkfeld, and Paracelsus. He taught,
   as his predecessors had done, that the inner word, and not the
   Scriptures, was the source of true knowledge, that all that God creates
   is God himself, and that all that is good in man is of the substance of
   God. The most remarkable writer of this class was Jacob Boehme, who was
   born near Gorlitz in Silesia, in 1575. His parents were peasants, and
   he himself a shoemaker. That such a man should write books which have
   proved a mine of thoughts to Schelling, Hegel, and Coleridge, as well
   as to a whole class of theologians, is decisive evidence of his
   extraordinary gifts. In character he was mild, gentle, and devout; and
   although denounced as a heretic, he constantly professed his allegiance
   to the faith of the Church. He regarded himself as having received in
   answer to prayer, on three different occasions. communications of
   divine light and knowledge which he was impelled to reveal to others.
   He did not represent the primordial being as without attributes or
   qualities of which nothing could be predicated, but as the seat of all
   kinds of forces seeking development. What the Bible teaches of the
   Trinity, he understood as an account of the development of the universe
   out of God and its relation to him. He was a theosophist in one sense,
   in which Vaughan [44] defines the term, "One who gives you a theory of
   God or of the works of God, which has not reason, but an inspiration of
   his own for its basis." "The theosophists," says Fleming, [45] "are a
   school of philosophers who mix enthusiasm with observation, alchemy
   with theology, metaphysics with medicine, and clothe the whole with a
   form of mystery and inspiration." [46]

   § 5. Quietism.

   A. Its general character.

   Tholuck [47] says "There is a law of seasons in the spiritual, as well
   as in the physical world, in virtue of which when the time has come,
   without apparent connection, similar phenomena reveal themselves in
   different places. As towards the end of the fifteenth century an
   ecclesiastical-doctrinal reformatory movement passed over the greater
   part of Europe, in part without apparent connection; so at the end of
   the seventeenth a mystical and spiritual tendency was almost as
   extensively manifested. In Germany, it took the form of Mysticism and
   Pietism; in England, of Quakerism; in France, of Jansenism and
   Mysticism; and in Spain and Italy, of Quietism." This movement was in
   fact what in our day would be called a revival of religion. Not indeed
   in a form free from grievous errors, but nevertheless it was a return
   to the religion of the heart, as opposed to the religion of forms. The
   Mystics of this period, although they constantly appealed to the
   mediæval Mystics, even to the Areopagite, and although they often used
   the same forms of expression, yet they adhered much more faithfully to
   Scriptural doctrines and to the faith of the Church. They did not fall
   into Pantheism, or believe in the absorption of the soul into the
   substance of God. They held, however, that the end to be attained was
   union with God. By this was not meant what Christians generally
   understand by that term; congeniality with God, delight in his
   perfections, assurance of his love, submission to his will, perfect
   satisfaction in the enjoyment of his favour. It was something more than
   all this, something mystical and therefore inexplicable; a matter of
   feeling not something to be understood or explained; a state in which
   all thought, all activity was suspended; a state of perfect quietude in
   which the soul is lost in God, -- an "écoulement et liquefaction de
   l'âme en Dieu," as it is expressed by St. Francis de Sales. This state
   is reached by few. It is to be attained not by the use of the means of
   grace or ordinances of the Church. The soul should be raised above the
   need of all such aids. It rises even above Christ, insomuch that it is
   not He whom the soul seeks, nor God in him; but God as God; the
   absolute, infinite God. The importance of the Scriptures, of prayer, of
   the sacraments, and of the truth concerning Christ, was not denied; but
   all these were regarded as belonging to the lower stages of the divine
   life. Nor was this rest and union with God to be attained by
   meditation; for meditation is discursive. It implies an effort to bring
   truth before the mind, and fixing the attention upon it. All conscious
   self-activity must be suspended in order to this perfect rest in God.
   It is a state in which the soul is out of itself; a state of ecstasy,
   according to the etymological meaning of the word.

   This state is to be reached in the way prescribed by the older Mystics;
   first, by negation or abstraction; that is, the abstraction of the soul
   from everything out of God, from the creature, from all interest,
   concern, or impression from sensible objects. Hence the connection
   between Mysticism, in this form, and asceticism. Not only must the soul
   become thus abstracted from the creature, but it must be dead to self.
   All regard to self must be lost. There can be no prayer, for prayer is
   asking something for self; no thanksgiving, for thanksgiving implies
   gratitude for good done to self. Self must be lost. There must be no
   preference for heaven over hell. One of the points most strenuously
   insisted upon was a willingness to be damned, if such were the will of
   God. In the controversy between Fénélon and Bossuet, the main question
   concerned disinterested love, whether in loving God the soul must be
   raised above all regard to its own holiness and happiness. This pure or
   disinterested love justifies, or renders righteous in the sight of God.
   Although the Mystics of this period were eminently pure as well as
   devout, they nevertheless sometimes laid down principles, or at least
   used expressions, which gave their enemies a pretext for charging them
   with Antinomianism. It was said, that a soul filled with this love, or
   reduced to this entire negation of self, cannot sin; "sin is not in,
   but outside of him:" which was made to mean, that nothing was sin to
   the perfect. It is an instructive psychological fact that when men
   attempt or pretend to rise above the law of God, they sink below it;
   that Perfectionism has so generally led to Antinomianism.

   B. Leaders of this Movement.

   The principal persons engaged in promoting this remarkable religious
   movement were Molinos, Madame Guyon, and Archbishop Fénélon. Michael
   Molinos, born 1640, was a Spanish priest. About 1670 he became a
   resident of Rome, where he gained a great reputation for piety and
   mildness, and great influence from his position as confessor to many
   families of distinction. He enjoyed the friendship of the highest
   authorities in the Church, including several of tile cardinals, and the
   Pope, Innocent XI., himself. In 1675 he published his "Spiritual
   Guide," in which the principles above stated were presented. Molinos
   did not claim originality, but professed to rely on the Mystics of the
   Middle Ages, several of whom had already been canonized by the Church.
   This, however, did not save him from persecution. His first trial
   indeed before the Inquisition resulted in his acquittal. But
   subsequently, through the influence of the Jesuits and of the court of
   Louis XIV., he was, after a year's imprisonment, condemned. Agreeably
   to his principle of entire subjection to the Church, he retracted his
   errors, but failed to secure the confidence of his judges. He died in
   1697. His principal work, "Manuductio Spiritualis," or Spiritual Guide,
   was translated into different languages, and won for him many adherents
   in every part of the Catholic world. When he was imprisoned, it is
   said, that twenty thousand letters from all quarters, and many of them
   from persons of distinction, were found among his papers, assuring him
   of the sympathy of their authors with him in his spirit and views. This
   is proof that there were at that time thousands in the Romish Church
   who had not bowed the knee to the Baal of formalism.

   Madame Guyon.

   The most prominent and influential of the Quietists, as they were
   called, was Madame Guyon, born 1648 and died 1717. She belonged to a
   rich and noble family; was educated in a cloister, married at sixteen
   to a man of rank and wealth and of three times her age; faithful and
   devoted, but unhappy in her domestic relations; adhering zealously to
   her Church, she passed a life of incessant labour, and that, too,
   embittered by persecution. When still in the cloister she came under
   the influence of the writings of St. Francis de Sales, which determined
   her subsequent course. Enthusiastic in temperament, endowed with
   extraordinary gifts, she soon came to regard herself as the recipient
   of visions, revelations, and inspirations by which she was impelled to
   write, and, in the first instance, to devote herself to the conversion
   of Protestants. Failing in this, she considered it her vocation to
   become the mother of spiritual children, by bringing them to adopt her
   views of the inner life. To this object she devoted herself with
   untiring energy and great success, her adherents, secret and avowed,
   being numbered by thousands, or, as she supposed, by millions. She thus
   drew upon herself, although devoted to the Church, the displeasure of
   the authorities, and was imprisoned for seven years in the Bastile and
   other prisons in France. The latter years of her life she spent in
   retirement in the house of her daughter, burdened with physical
   infirmities, hearing mass every day in her private chapel and
   communicating every other day. Her principal works were, "La Bible avec
   des Explications et Réflexions, qui regardent la Vie Intérieure,"
   "Moyen court et très-facile de faire Oraison." This little work excited
   great attention and great opposition. She was obliged to defend it in
   an "Apologie du Moyen Court," in 1690, and "Justifications" in 1694,
   and in 1695 she was forced to retract thirty-five propositions selected
   therefrom. She published an allegorical poem under the title "Les
   Torrens." Her minor poetic pieces called "Poésies Spirituelles," in
   four volumes, are greatly admired for the genius which they display.

   Archbishop Fénélon, one of the greatest lights of the Gallican Church,
   espoused the cause of Madame Guyon, and published, 1697, "Explication
   des Maximes des Saints sur la Vie Intérieure." As the title intimates,
   the principles of this book are derived from the earlier Mystics, and
   specially from the latest of the saints, St. Francis de Sales, who was
   canonized in 1665, only thirty-three years after his death. Although
   Fénélon carefully avoided the extravagances of the Mystics of his own
   day, and although he taught nothing which men venerated in the Church
   had not taught before him, his book forfeited for him the favour of the
   court, and was finally condemned by the authorities at Rome. To this
   condemnation he submitted with the greatest docility. He not only made
   no defence, but read the brief of condemnation in his own pulpit, and
   forbade his book being read within his diocese. To this his conscience
   constrained him, although he probably did not change his views. As the
   Pope decided against him he was willing to admit that what he said was
   wrong, and yet what he intended to say he still held to be right.

   § 6. The Quakers or Friends.

   This widely extended and highly respected body of professing Christians
   constitute the most permanent and best organized representatives of the
   principles of Mysticism which have appeared in the Church. They have
   existed as an organized society nearly two centuries and a half, and
   number in Europe and America several hundred thousands.

   A. Their Origin and Early History.

   They took their origin and name from George Fox, who was born at
   Drayton, Leicestershire, England, in 1624. He received only the
   rudiments of an English education, and was by trade a shoemaker. From
   boyhood he was remarkable for his quiet, secluded habits. He devoted
   his leisure to the reading of the Scriptures and meditation. The age in
   which he lived was one of corruption in the Church and agitation in the
   State. He was so impressed by the evils which he saw around him that he
   lost confidence in the teachers of religion and in the ordinances of
   the church. At last he felt himself called of God, by direct revelation
   and inspiration, to denounce the existing Church, its organization and
   officers, and to proclaim a new and spiritual dispensation. This
   dispensation was to be new only relatively to what had long existed. It
   was designed as a restoration of the apostolic age, when the church was
   guided and extended by the Spirit, without the intervention of the
   written Word, or, as Fox and his followers maintained, of a special
   order of ministers, but every man and every woman spake as the Spirit
   gave them utterance. [48]

   They were called Quakers either because they themselves trembled when
   under the influence of the Spirit, or because they were in the habit of
   calling on those whom they addressed to quake in fear of the judgment
   of God. The designation has long ceased to be appropriate, as they are
   characteristically quiet in their worship, and gentle toward those who
   are without. They call themselves Friends because opposed to violence,
   contention, and especially to war. At first, however, they were
   chargeable with many irregularities, which, in connection with their
   refusing to pay tithes, to take oaths, and to perform military service,
   gave pretext to frequent and long continued persecutions.

   The Quakers were at first, as a class, illiterate, but men from the
   educated classes soon joined them, and by their influence the
   irregularities connected with the movement were corrected, and the
   society reduced to a regularly organized form. The most prominent of
   these men were George Keith, Samuel Fisher, and William Penn. The last
   named, the son of a British admiral, proved his sincerity by the
   sacrifices and sufferings to which his adherence to a sect, then
   despised and persecuted, subjected him. From the influence which he
   possessed, as the friend and favorite of James II, he was able to do
   much for his brethren, and having received a grant from the crown, of
   what is now Pennsylvania, he transported a colony of them to this
   country and founded one of the most important States of the American
   Union. The man, however, who did most to reduce the principles of
   George Fox to order, and to commend them to the religious and literary
   public, was Robert Barclay. Barclay was a member of a prominent
   Scottish family, and received the benefit of an extended and varied
   education. He was born in 1648, and died in 1690. His principal work,
   "Theologiæ Christianæ Apologia," is an exposition of fifteen theses
   which he had previously written and printed under the title, "Theses
   Theologicæ onnnibus Clericis et præsertim universis Doctoribus,
   Professoribus et Studiosis Theologiæ in Academiis Europæ versantibus
   sive Pontificis sive Protestantibus oblatæ."

   B. Their Doctrines.

   It is impossible to give a satisfactory view of the doctrines of the
   Quakers. They have no authoritative creed or exposition of doctrine
   which all who call themselves Quakers acknowledge. Their most prominent
   writers differ in their views on many important points. The opinions of
   no one, nor of several authors, can be fairly taken as representing the
   views of the Society. There are in fact three classes of Quakers.

   First. Those who call themselves orthodox, and who differ very little
   from the great body of evangelical Christians. To this belongs the
   great majority of the Society both in this country and in Great
   Britain. This appears from the testimonies repeatedly issued by the
   "Yearly Meetings," the representative bodies of the Society. This is a
   much more satisfactory witness of the general faith of the body than
   the declarations of individual writers, however eminent, for which the
   Society is not responsible. A very clear and comprehensive summary of
   the doctrine of Friends is to be found in the "History of Religious
   Denominations in the United States," compiled by I. Daniel Rupp. The
   articles in this work were written by eminent men belonging to the
   several denominations whose views are represented. That which relates
   to the Quakers was written by the late Thomas Evans, a prominent
   minister of the Society, and a truly representative man. Without
   referring to the peculiar doctrines of the Society, the following
   extracts show how near the orthodox Quakers (i.e., the Society itself,
   as represented in its yearly meetings) come to the common faith of
   Protestant churches.

   Doctrines of the Orthodox Friends.

   1. As to God, it is said, Quakers "Believe in one only wise,
   omnipotent, and everlasting God, the creator and upholder of all things
   visible and invisible; and in one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all
   things, the mediator between God and man; and in the Holy Spirit which
   proceedeth from the Father and the Son; one God blessed forever. In
   expressing their views relative to the awful and mysterious doctrine of
   "the Three that bear record in heaven," they have carefully avoided the
   use of unscriptural terms, invented to define Him who is undefinable,
   and have scrupulously adhered to the safe and simple language of Holy
   Scripture, as contained in Matt. xxviii. 18, 19."

   2. As to the person and work of Christ, "They own and believe in Jesus
   Christ, the beloved and only begotten Son of God, who was conceived of
   the Holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin Mary. . . . . They believe that
   He alone is the Redeemer and Saviour of man, the captain of salvation,
   who saves from sin as well as from hell and the wrath to come, and
   destroys the works of the devil. He is the seed of the woman that
   bruises the serpent's head; even Christ Jesus, the Alpha and Omega, the
   first and last. He is, as the Scriptures of truth say of him, our
   wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, neither is there
   salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given
   among men whereby we may be saved."

   "The Society of Friends have uniformly declared their belief in the
   divinity and manhood of the Lord Jesus: that He was both true God and
   perfect man, and that his sacrifice of himself upon the cross was a
   propitiation and atonement for the sins of the whole world, and that
   the remission of sins which any partake of, is only in, and by virtue
   of, that most satisfactory sacrifice."

   3. As to the Holy Ghost, "Friends believe in the Holy Spirit, or
   Comforter, the promise of the Father, whom Christ declared he would
   send in his name, to lead and guide his followers, into all truth, to
   teach them all things, and to bring all things to their remembrance. .
   . . . They believe that the saving knowledge of God and Christ cannot
   be attained in any other way than by the revelation of this Spirit; --
   for the Apostle says, What man knoweth the things of a man, save the
   spirit of man which is in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no
   man, but the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the
   world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things
   which are freely given to us of God.' If, therefore, the things which
   properly appertain to man cannot be discerned by any lower principle
   than the spirit of man; those things which properly relate to God and
   Christ, cannot be known by any power inferior to that of the holy
   Spirit."

   4. As to man, "They believe that man was created in the image of God,
   capable of understanding the divine law, and of molding communion with
   his Maker. Through transgression he fell from this blessed state, and
   lost the heavenly image. His posterity come into the world in the image
   of the earthly man; and, until renewed by the quickening and
   regenerating power of the heavenly man, Christ Jesus, manifested in
   time soul, they are fallen, degenerated, and dead to the divine life in
   which Adam originally stood, and are subject to the power, nature, and
   seed of the serpent; and not only their words and deeds, but their
   imaginations, are evil perpetually in the sight of God. Man, therefore,
   in this state can know nothing aright concerning God; his thoughts and
   conceptions of spiritual things, until he is disjoined from this evil
   seed and united to the divine light, Christ Jesus, are unprofitable to
   himself and to others."

   5. As to the future state, "The Society of Friends believe that there
   will be a resurrection both of the righteous and the wicked; the one to
   eternal life and blessedness, and the other to everlasting misery and
   torment, agreeably to Matt. xxv. 31-46; John v. 25-30; 1 Cor. xv.
   12-58. That God will judge the world by that man whom He hath ordained,
   even Christ Jesus the Lord, who will render unto every man according to
   his works."

   6. As to the Scriptures, "The religious Society of Friends has always
   believed that the Holy Scriptures were written by divine inspiration,
   and contain a declaration of all the fundamental doctrines and
   principles relating to eternal life and salvation, and that whatsoever
   doctrine or practice is contrary to them, is to be rejected as false
   and erroneous; that they are a declaration of the mind and will of God,
   in and to the several ages in which they were written and are
   obligatory on us, and are to be read, believed, and fulfilled by the
   assistance of divine grace. . . . . It looks upon them as the only fit
   outward judge and test of controversies among Christians, and is very
   willing that all its doctrines and practices should be tried by them,
   freely admitting that whatsoever any do, pretending to the Spirit,
   which is contrary to the Scriptures, be condemned as a delusion of the
   devil."

   It thus appears that the orthodox Friends are in sympathy, on all
   fundamental doctrines, with the great body of their fellow Christians.

   Heterodox Friends.

   Secondly. There is a class calling themselves Friends, and retaining
   the organization of the Society, and its usages as to dress, language,
   and mode of worship, who are really Deists. They admit of no higher
   authority, in matters of religion, than the natural reason and
   conscience of man, and hold little if anything as true beyond the
   truths of natural religion. This class has been disowned by the Society
   in its representative capacity.

   Thirdly. There is a third class which does not constitute an organized
   or separate body, but includes men of very different views. As has been
   already remarked, great diversity of opinion existed among the Quakers,
   especially during the early period of their history. This diversity
   related to the common doctrines of Christianity, to the nature of the
   inward guiding light in which all professed to believe, and to the
   authority due to the sacred Scriptures. Some explicitly denied the
   doctrine of the Trinity and the satisfaction of Christ; some seemed to
   ignore the historical Christ altogether, and to refer everything to the
   Christ within. Others, while admitting the historical verity of the
   life of Christ, and of his work on earth, regarded his redemption as
   altogether subjective. He saves us not by what He has done for us, but
   exclusively by what He does in us. This, as we have seen, is the
   characteristic tendency of Mysticism in all its modifications.

   C. The Doctrine of Friends as to the Inward Light given to all Men.

   Still greater diversity of views prevailed as to the nature of the
   inward light which constitutes the distinguishing doctrine of the
   Society. The orthodox Quakers on this subject, in the first place,
   carefully distinguish this "light" from the natural reason and
   conscience of men; and also from spiritual discernment, or that inward
   work of the Spirit, which all Christians acknowledge, by which the soul
   is enabled to know "the things of the Spirit" as they are revealed in
   the Scriptures, and without which there can be no saving faith, and no
   holiness of heart or life. This spiritual illumination is peculiar to
   the true people of God; the inward light, in which the Quakers believe,
   is common to all men. The design and effect of the "inward light" are
   the communication of new truth or of truth not objectively revealed, as
   well as the spiritual discernment of the truths of Scripture. The
   design and effect of spiritual illumination are the proper apprehension
   of truth already speculatively known.

   Secondly. By the inner light the orthodox Quakers understand the
   supernatural influence of the Holy Spirit, concerning which they
   teach,-- (1.) That it is given to all men. (2.) That it not only
   convinces of sin, and enables the soul to apprehend aright the truths
   of Scripture, but also communicates a knowledge of "the mysteries of
   salvation." "A manifestation of this Spirit they believe is given to
   every man to profit withal; that it convicts of sin, and, as attended
   to, gives power to the soul to overcome and forsake it; it opens the
   mind to the mysteries of salvation, enables it savingly to understand
   the truths recorded in the Holy Scriptures, and gives it the living,
   practical, and heartfelt experience of those things which pertain to
   its everlasting welfare." "He hath communicated a measure of the light
   of his own Son, a measure of the grace of the Holy Spirit -- by which
   he invites, calls, exhorts, and strives with every man, in order to
   save him; which light or grace, as it is received and not resisted,
   works the salvation of all, even of those who are ignorant of Adam's
   fall, and of the death and sufferings of Christ; both by bringing them
   to a sense of their own misery, and to be sharers of the sufferings of
   Christ, inwardly; and by making them partakers of his resurrection, in
   becoming holy, pure, and righteous, and recovered out of their sins."
   [49]

   Thirdly. The orthodox Friends teach concerning this inward light, as
   has been already shown, that it is subordinate to the Holy Scriptures,
   inasmuch as the Scriptures are the infallible rule of faith and
   practice, and everything contrary thereto is to be rejected as false
   and destructive.

   Barclay's Views.

   While such are the views of the orthodox Friends, it must be admitted
   that many hold a different doctrine. This is true not only of those
   whom the Society has disowned, but of many men most prominent in their
   history. This difference relates both to what this light is, and to its
   authority. As to the former of these points the language employed is so
   diverse, and so figurative, that it is difficult to determine its real
   meaning. Some of the early Quakers spoke as though they adopted the
   doctrine of the earlier Mystics, that this inward principle was God
   himself, the divine substance. Others speak of it as Christ, or even
   the body of Christ, or his life. Others as "a seed," which is declared
   to be no part of the nature of man; no remains of the image of God in
   which Adam was created; neither is it the substance of God.
   Nevertheless, it is declared to be "a spiritual substance," in which
   the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are present. This seed comes from
   Christ, and is communicated to every man. In some it lies as a seed
   upon a rock, which never shows any sign of life. But when the soul
   receives a visitation of the Spirit, if his influence be not resisted,
   that seed is vivified, and develops into holiness of heart and life; by
   which the soul is purified and justified. We are not justified by our
   works. Everything is due to Christ. He is both "the giver and the
   gift." Nevertheless our justification consists in this subjective
   change. [50] A distinction is made between a twofold redemption; the
   one "performed and accomplished by Christ for us in his crucified body
   without us; the other is the redemption wrought by Christ in us. "The
   first is that whereby a man, as he stands in the fall, is put in a
   capacity of salvation, and hath conveyed unto him a measure of that
   power, virtue, spirit, life, and grace that was in Christ Jesus, which,
   as the free gift of God, is able to counterbalance, overcome, and root
   out the evil seed, wherewith we are naturally, as in the fall,
   leavened. The second is that whereby we witness and know this pure and
   perfect redemption in ourselves, purifying, cleansing, and redeeming us
   from the power of corruption, and bringing us into unity, favour, and
   friendship with God." [51]

   With regard to the authority of this inward light, while the orthodox
   make it subordinate to the Scriptures, many of the early Friends made
   the written, subordinate to the inner, word; and others, as Barclay
   himself, make the two coordinate. Although in this matter he is hardly
   consistent with himself. He expressly denies that the Scriptures are to
   us "the fountain" of truth; that they are "the principal ground of all
   truth and knowledge, or yet the adequate primary rule of faith and
   manners." They are, however, "to be esteemed a secondary role
   subordinate to the Spirit." Nevertheless, he teaches with equal
   plainness that what "cannot be proved by Scripture, is no necessary
   article of faith." [52] Again, he says: We are "willing to admit it as
   a positive and certain maxim, that whatsoever any do, pretending to the
   Spirit, which is contrary to the Scriptures, be accounted and reckoned
   a delusion of the devil." [53] He "freely subscribes to that saying,
   Let him that preacheth any other gospel than that which hath already
   been preached by the Apostles, and according to the Scriptures, be
   accursed." [54] We look on the Scriptures, he says, "as the only fit
   outward judge of controversies among Christians, and that whatsoever
   doctrine is contrary unto their testimony, may therefore justly be
   rejected as false." [55] His whole book, therefore, is an effort to
   prove from Scripture all the peculiar doctrines of Quakerism.

   His theory is, (1.) That all men since the fall are in a state of
   spiritual death from which they are utterly unable to deliver
   themselves. He is severe in his denunciation of all Pelagian and
   semi-Pelagian doctrine. (2.) That God determined, through his Son our
   Lord Jesus Christ, to make provision for the salvation of all men. (3.)
   The work of Christ secures the opportunity and means of salvation for
   every man (4.) Through him and for his sake "a seed" is given to every
   man which, under the influence of the Spirit, may be developed into
   righteousness and holiness, restoring the soul to the image and
   fellowship of God. (5.) To every man is granted "a day of visitation"
   in which the Spirit comes to him and exerts an influence which, if not
   resisted, vivifies this divine seed, and thus gives the opportunity of
   being saved (6.) The measure of this divine influence is not the same
   in all cases. In some it is irresistible, in others, not. In some it is
   as abundant as in the prophets and Apostles, rendering its subjects as
   authoritative as teachers as the original Apostles. (7.) The office of
   the Spirit is to teach and to guide. It is not merely intended to
   enlighten the mind in the knowledge of truths contained un the
   Scriptures. It presents truth objectively to the mind. It does not
   reveal new doctrines, much less doctrines opposed to those revealed in
   the Scriptures; but it makes a new and independent revelation of old
   doctrines. On this point Barclay is very explicit. [56] His discussion
   of his second and third propositions, -- the one concerning "immediate
   revelation," and the other, "the Scriptures," -- sets forth this
   doctrine at length. "We distinguish," he says, "between a revelation of
   a new gospel and new doctrines, and a new revelation of the good old
   gospel and doctrines; the last we plead for, but the first we utterly
   deny." Natural reason reveals certain doctrines, but this is not
   inconsistent with a new revelation of the same doctrines in the
   Scriptures. So the fact that the gospel is revealed in the Scriptures
   is not inconsistent with its immediate objective revelation to the soul
   by the Spirit.

   Besides the great doctrines of salvation, there are many things the
   Christian needs to know which are not contained in the Scriptures. In
   these matters he is not left to his own guidance. The Spirit "guides
   into all truth." "Therefore," says Barclay, "the Spirit of God leadeth,
   instructeth, and teacheth every true Christian whatsoever is needful
   for him to know." For example, whether He is to preach; and, if called
   to preach, when, where, and what he shall preach; where he is to go,
   and in any emergency what he ought to do. So the Spirit teaches us when
   and where we are to pray, and what we are to pray for. As the Spirit's
   guidance extends to everything, it should be sought and obeyed in all
   things.

   Quakerism ignores the distinction between inspired and uninspired men,
   except as to the measure of the Spirit's influence. He dwells in all
   believers, and performs the same office in all. As the saints of old,
   before the giving of the law, were under his instruction and guidance,
   so they continued to enjoy his teaching after the law was given. All
   through the Old Testament dispensation the people of God received
   immediate revelations and directions. When Christ came there was a more
   copious communication of this influence. These communications were not
   confined to either sex, or to any class in the Church. They were not
   peculiar to the Apostles, or to ministers, but to every one was given a
   manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal. The state of the Church,
   as set forth in the New Testament as to this matter, continues to the
   present time, except that the gifts bestowed are not of the same
   miraculous character now that they were then. But as to his revealing,
   enlightening, teaching, guiding operations, He is as much present with
   believers now as during the apostolic age. Then all spake as the Spirit
   gave them utterance. When Christians assembled together every one had
   his gift: one a psalm, one a doctrine, another a revelation, another an
   interpretation. Every one could speak; but it was to be done decently
   and in order. If anything were revealed to one sitting by, he was to
   hold his peace until his time came; for God is not the author of
   confusion. In 1 Cor. xiv. we have the Quaker ideal or model of a
   Christian assembly. And as the Apostles went hither and thither, not
   according to their own judgment, but supernaturally guided by the
   Spirit, so the Spirit guides all believers in the ordinary affairs of
   life, it they wait for the intimations of his will.

   As this doctrine of the Spirit's guidance is the fundamental principle
   of Quakerism, it is the source of all the peculiarities by which the
   Society of Friends has ever been distinguished. If every man has within
   himself an infallible guide as to truth and duty, he does not need
   external teaching. If it be the office of the Spirit to reveal truth
   objectively to the mind, and to indicate on all occasions the path of
   duty; and if his revealing and guiding influence be universal, and
   immediate, self-evidencing itself as divine, it must of necessity
   supersede all others; just as the Scriptures supersede reason in
   matters of religion. The Quakers, therefore, although, as has been
   shown, acknowledging the divine authority of the Scriptures, make far
   less of them than other denominations of evangelical Christians. They
   make very little of the Church and its ordinances; of the Sabbath; of a
   stated ministry; and nothing of the sacraments as external ordinances
   and means of grace. In all these respects their influence has been
   hurtful to the cause of Christ, while it is cheerfully admitted that
   some of the best Christians of our age belong to the Society of
   Friends.

   § 7. Objections to the Mystical Theory.

   The idea on which Mysticism is founded is Scriptural and true. It is
   true that God has access to the human soul. It is true that He can,
   consistently with his own nature and with the laws of our being,
   supernaturally and immediately reveal truth objectively to the mind,
   and attend that revelation with evidence which produces an infallible
   assurance of its truth and of its divine origin. It is also true that
   such revelations have often been made to the children of men. But these
   cases of immediate supernatural revelation belong to the category of
   miracles. They are rare and are to be duly authenticated.

   The common doctrine of the Christian Church is, that God has at sundry
   times and in divers manners spoken to the children of men; that what
   eye hath not seen, or ear heard, what never could have entered into the
   heart of man, God has revealed by his Spirit to those whom He selected
   to be his spokesmen to their fellow-men; that these revelations were
   authenticated as divine, by their character, their effects, and by
   signs and wonders, and divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost;
   that these holy men of old who spake as they were moved by the Holy
   Ghost, communicated the revelations which they had received not only
   orally, but in writing, employing not the words which man's wisdom
   teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; so that we have in the
   sacred Scriptures the things of the Spirit recorded in the words of the
   Spirit; which Scriptures, therefore, are the Word of God, -- i.e., what
   God says to man; what He declares to be true and obligatory, -- and
   constitute for his Church the only infallible rule of faith and
   practice.

   Romanists, while admitting the infallibility of the written Word, still
   contend that it is not sufficient; and hold that God continues in a
   supernatural manner to guide the Church by rendering its bishops
   infallible teachers in all matters pertaining to truth and duty.

   Mystics, making the same admission as to the infallibility of
   Scripture, claim that the Spirit is given to every man as an inward
   teacher and guide, whose instructions and influence are the highest
   rule of faith, and sufficient, even without the Scriptures, to secure
   the salvation of the soul.

   Mysticism has no Foundation in the Scriptures.

   The objections to the Romish and Mystical theory are substantially the
   same.

   1. There is no foundation for either in Scriptures. As the Scriptures
   contain no promise of infallible guidance to bishops, so they contain
   no promise of the Spirit as the immediate revealer of truth to every
   man. Under the Old Testament dispensation the Spirit did indeed reveal
   the mind and purposes of God; but it was to selected persons chosen to
   be prophets, authenticated as divine messengers, whose instructions the
   people were bound to receive as coming from God. In like manner, under
   the new dispensation, our Lord selected twelve men, endowed them with
   plenary knowledge of the Gospel, rendered them infallible as teachers,
   and required all men to receive their instructions as the words of God.
   It is true that during the apostolic age there were occasional
   communications made to a class of persons called prophets. But this
   "gift of prophecy," that is, the gift of speaking under the inspiration
   of the Spirit, was analogous to the gift of miracles. The one has as
   obviously ceased as the other.

   It is true, also, that our Lord promised to send the Spirit, who was to
   abide with the Church, to dwell in his people, to be their teacher, and
   to guide them into the knowledge of all truth. But what truth? Not
   historical or scientific truth, but plainly revealed truth; truth which
   He himself had taught, or made known by his authorized messengers. The
   Spirit is indeed a teacher; and without his instructions there is no
   saving knowledge of divine things, for the Apostle tells us, "The
   natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are
   foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are
   spiritually discerned." (1 Cor. ii. 14.) Spiritual discernment,
   therefore, is the design and effect of the Spirit's teaching. And the
   things discerned are "the things freely given to us of God," i.e., as
   the context shows, the things revealed to the Apostles and clearly made
   known in the Scriptures.

   The Apostle John tells his readers, "Ye have an unction from the Holy
   One, and ye know all things" (1 John ii. 20), and again, ver. 27, "The
   anointing which ye have received of Him abideth in you, and ye need not
   that any man teach you; but as the same anointing teacheth you of all
   things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye
   shall abide in Him." These passages teach what all evangelical
   Christians admit. First, that true knowledge, or spiritual discernment
   of divine things, is due to the inward teaching of the Holy Spirit; and
   secondly, that true faith, or the infallible assurance of the truths
   revealed, is due in like manner to the "demonstration of tine Spirit."
   (1 Cor. ii. 4.) The Apostle John also says: "He that believeth on the
   Son of God, hath the witness in himself." (1 John v. 10.) Saving faith
   does not rest on the testimony of the Church, nor on the outward
   evidence of miracles and prophecy, but on the inward testimony of the
   Spirit with and by the truth in our hearts. He who has this inward
   testimony needs no other. He does not need to be told by other men what
   is truth; this same anointing teaches him what is truth, and that no
   lie is of the truth. Christians were not to believe every spirit. They
   were to try the spirits whether they were of God. And the test or
   criterion of trial was the external, authenticated revelation of God,
   as spiritually discerned and demonstrated by the inward operations of
   the Spirit. So now when errorists come and tell the people there is no
   God, no sin, no retribution, no need of a Saviour, or of expiation, or
   of faith; that Jesus of Nazareth is not the Son of God, God manifest in
   the flesh, the true Christian has no need to be told that these are
   what the Apostle calls lies. He has an inward witness to the truth of
   the record which God has given of his Son.

   If the Bible gives no support to the Mystical doctrine of the inward,
   supernatural, objective revelation of truth made by the Spirit to every
   man, that doctrine is destitute of all foundation, for it is only by
   the testimony of God that any such doctrine can be established.

   Mysticism is contrary to the Scriptures.

   2. The doctrine in question is not only destitute of support from
   Scripture, but it contradicts the Scriptures. It is not only opposed to
   isolated declarations of the Word of God, but to the whole revealed
   plan of God's dealing with his people. Everywhere, and under all
   dispensations, the rule of faith and duty has been the teaching of
   authenticated messengers of God. The appeal has always been "to the law
   and testimony." The prophets came saying, "Thus saith the Lord." Men
   were required to believe and obey what was communicated to them, and
   not what the Spirit revealed to each individual. It was the outward and
   not the inward word to which they were to attend. And under the gospel
   the command of Christ to his disciples, was, "Go ye into all the world
   and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is
   baptized shall be saved" (Mar. xvi. 15, 16), -- believeth, of course,
   the gospel which they preached. Faith cometh by hearing. "How," asks
   the Apostle, "shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
   and how shall they hear without a preacher?" (Rom. x. 14.) God, he
   tells us, hath determined to save men by the foolishness of preaching.
   (1 Cor. i. 21.) It is the preaching of the cross he declares to be the
   power of God. (Verse 18.) It is the gospel, the external revelation of
   the plan of salvation through Jesus Christ, he says in Rom. i. 16,
   which "is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth,
   to the Jew first, and also to the Greek; for therein is the
   righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith." This idea runs
   through the whole New Testament. Christ commissioned his disciples to
   preach the gospel. He declared that to be the way in which men were to
   be saved. They accordingly went forth preaching everywhere. This
   preaching was to continue to the end of the world. Therefore, provision
   was made for continuing the ministry. Men called and qualified by the
   Spirit, were to be selected and set apart to this work by divine
   command. And it is in this way, so far, the world has been converted.
   In no case do we find the Apostles calling upon the people, whether
   Jews or Gentiles, to look within themselves, to listen to the inner
   Word. They were to listen to the outward Word; to believe what they
   heard, and were to pray for the Holy Spirit to enable them to
   understand, receive, and obey what was thus externally made known to
   them.

   Contrary to the Facts of Experience.

   3. The doctrine in question is no less contrary to fact than it is to
   Scripture. The doctrine teaches that by the inward revelation of the
   Spirit saving knowledge of truth and duty is given to every man. But
   all experience shows that without the written Word, men everywhere and
   in all ages, are ignorant of divine things, -- without God, without
   Christ, and without hope in the world. The sun is not more obviously
   the source of light, than the Bible is the source of divine knowledge.
   The absence of the one is as clearly indicated as the absence of the
   other. It is incredible that an inward revelation of saving truth is
   made to every man by the Holy Spirit, if the appropriate effects of
   that revelation are nowhere manifested. It is to be remembered that
   without the knowledge of God, there can be no religion. Without right
   apprehensions of the Supreme Being, there can be no right affections
   towards him. Without the knowledge of Christ, there can be no faith in
   him. Without truth there can be no holiness, any more than there can be
   vision without light. As right apprehensions of God, and holiness of
   heart and life, are nowhere found where the Scriptures are unknown, it
   is plain that the Scriptures, and not an inward light common to all
   men, are, by the ordinance of God, the only source to us of saving and
   sanctifying kmnowledge.

   There is a sense in which, as all evangelical Christians believe, the
   Spirit is given to every man. He is present with every human mind
   exciting to good and restraining from evil. To this the order, and what
   there is of morality in the world, are due. Without this "common
   grace," or general influence of the Spirit, there would be no
   difference between our world and hell; for hell is a place or state in
   which men are finally given up of God. In like manner, there is a
   general providential efficiency of God by which He cooperates with
   second causes, in the productions of the wonderful phenomena of the
   external world. Without that coöperation -- the continued guidance of
   mind -- the cosmos would become chaos. But the fact that this
   providential efficiency of God is universal, is no proof that He
   everywhere works miracles, that He constantly operates without the
   intervention of second causes. So, also, the fact that the Spirit is
   present with every human mind, and constantly enforces the truth
   present to that mind, is no proof that He makes immediate, supernatural
   revelations to every human being. The fact is, we cannot see without
   light. We have the sun to give us light. It is vain to say that every
   man has an inward light sufficient to guide him without the sun. Facts
   are against the theory.

   No Criterion by which to judge of the Source of Inward Suggestions.

   4. A fourth objection to the Mystical doctrine is that there is no
   criterion by which a man can test these inward impulses or revelations,
   and determine which are from the Spirit of God, and which are from his
   own heart or from Satan, who often appears and acts as an angel of
   light. This objection, Barclay says, "Bespeaketh much ignorance in the
   opposers. . . . . For it is one thing to affirm that the true and
   undoubted revelation of God's Spirit is certain and infallible; and
   another thing to affirm that this or that particular person or people
   is led infallibly by this revelation in what they speak or write,
   because they affirm themselves to be so led by the inward and immediate
   revelation of the Spirit." [57] It is admitted that there is an inward
   and infallible testimony of the Spirit in the hearts of believers to
   the truths objectively revealed in the Scriptures. It is admitted,
   also, that there have been immediate revelations of truth to the mind,
   as in the case of the prophets and Apostles, and that these revelations
   authenticate themselves, or are attended with an infallible assurance
   that they come from God. But these admissions do not invalidate the
   objection as above stated. Granted that a man who receives a true
   revelation knows that it is from God; how is the man who receives a
   false revelation to know that it is not from God? Many men honestly
   believe themselves to be inspired, who are under the influence of some
   evil spirit, -- their own it may be. The assurance on certainty of
   conviction may be as strong in one case as in the other. In the one it
   is well founded, in the other it is a delusion. Irresistible conviction
   is not enough. It may satisfy the subject of it himself. But it cannot
   either satisfy others, or be a criterion of truth. Thousands have been,
   and still are, fully convinced that the false is true, and that what is
   wrong is right. To tell men, therefore, to look within for an
   authoritative guide, and to trust to their irresistible convictions, is
   to give them a guide which will lead them to destruction. When God
   really makes revelations to the soul, He not only gives an infallible
   assurance that the revelation is divine, but accompanies it with
   evidence satisfactory to others as well as to the recipient that it is
   from God. All his revelations have had the seal both of internal and
   external evidence. And when the believer is assured, by the testimony
   of the Spirit, of the truths of Scripture, he has only a new kind of
   evidence of what is already authenticated beyond all rational
   contradiction. Our blessed Lord Himself said to the Jews, "If I do not
   the works of my Father, believe me not. But if I do, though ye believe
   not me, believe the works." (John x. 37, 38.) He even goes so far as to
   say, "If I had not done among them the works which none other man did,
   they had not had sin." (John xv. 24.) The inward teaching and testimony
   of the Spirit are Scriptural truths, and truths of inestimable value.
   But it is ruinous to put them in the place of the divinely
   authenticated written Word.

   The Doctrine productive of Evil.

   5. Our Lord says of men, "By their fruits ye shall know them." The same
   rule of judgment applies to doctrines. Mysticism has always been
   productive of evil. It has led to the neglect or undervaluing of divine
   institutions, -- of the Church, of the ministry, of the sacraments, of
   the Sabbath, and of the Scriptures. History shows that it has also led
   to the greatest excesses and social evils. The Society of Friends has
   in a good degree escaped these evils but it has been by a happy
   inconsistency. They have not carried out their principle. For, while
   they teach that the inward revelations of the Spirit present the
   "formal object" of faith; that they are clear and certain, forcing "the
   well-disposed understanding to assent, irresistibly moving it thereto;"
   that they are the primary, immediate, and principal source of divine
   knowledge; that they are not "to be subjected to the examination either
   of the outward testimony of the Scriptures, or of the natural reason of
   man, as to a more noble or certain rule or touchstone;" [58] yet they
   also teach that nothing not contained in the Scriptures can be an
   article of faith; that we are bound to believe all the Bible teaches;
   that everything contrary to its teaching is to be rejected as "a
   delusion of the devil," no matter from what source it may come; and
   that the Scriptures are the judge of controversies among Christians;
   and thus they, as a society, have been preserved from the excesses into
   which Mystics have generally run. Nevertheless, the Mystical principle
   of immediate, objective revelation of truth to every man, as his
   principal and primary rule of faith and practice, has wrought with
   Friends its legitimate fruit, inasmuch as it has led to comparative
   neglect of the Scriptures and of the ordinances of the Church.

CHAPTER V.

  ROMAN CATHOLIC DOCTRINE CONCERNING THE RULE OF FAITH.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Statement of the Doctrine.

   1. Romanists reject the doctrine of the Rationalists who make human
   reason either the source or standard of religious truth. It is one of
   their principles, that faith is merely human when either its object or
   ground is human. Faith to be divine must have truth supernaturally
   revealed as its object, and the evidence on which it rests must be the
   supernatural testimony of God.

   2. They reject the Mystical doctrine that divine truth is revealed to
   every man by the Spirit. They admit an objective, supernatural
   revelation.

   3. They maintain, however, that this revelation is partly written and
   partly unwritten, that is, the rule of faith includes both Scripture
   and tradition. Moreover, as the people cannot certainly know what books
   are of divine origin, and, therefore, entitled to a place in the canon;
   and as they are incompetent to decide on the meaning of Scripture, or
   which among the multitude of traditionary doctrines and usages are
   divine, and which are human, God has made the Church an infallible
   teacher by which all these points are determined, whose testimony is
   the proximate and sufficient ground of faith to the people.

   So far as the Romish doctrine concerning the Rule of Faith differs from
   that of Protestants, it presents the following points for
   consideration: First, The doctrine of Romanists concerning the
   Scriptures. Second, Their doctrine concerning tradition. Third, Their
   doctrine concerning the office and authority of the Church as a
   teacher.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 2. Roman Catholic Doctrine concerning the Scriptures.

   On this subject Romanists agree with Protestants, (1.) In teaching the
   plenary inspiration and consequent infallible authority of the sacred
   writings. Of these writings the Council of Trent says that God is their
   author, and that they were written by the dictation of the Holy Spirit
   ("Spiritu sancto dictante.") (2.) They agree with us in receiving into
   the sacred canon all the books which we regard as of divine authority.

   Romanists differ from Protestants in regard to the Scriptures, --

   1. In receiving into the canon certain books which Protestants do not
   admit to be inspired, namely: Tobit, Judith, Sirach, parts of Esther,
   the Wisdom of Solomon, First, Second, and Third Books of the Maccabees
   (the Third Book of Maccabees, however, is not included in the Vulgate),
   Baruch, the Hymn of the Three Children, Susanna, and Bel and the
   Dragon. These books are not all included by name in the list given by
   the Council of Trent. Several of them are parts of the books there
   enumerated. Thus, the Hymn of the Three Children, Susanna, and Bel and
   the Dragon, appear as parts of the book of Daniel. Some modern
   theologians of the Romish Church refer all the apocryphal books to what
   they call "The Second Canon," and admit that they are not of equal
   authority with those belonging to the First Canon. [59] The Council of
   Trent, however, makes no such distinction.

   Incompleteness of the Scriptures.

   2. A second point of difference is that Romanists deny, and Protestants
   affirm, the completeness of the sacred Scriptures. That is, Protestants
   maintain that all the extant supernatural revelations of God, which
   constitute the rule of faith to his Church, are contained in his
   written word. Romanists, on the other hand, hold that some doctrines
   which all Christians are bound to believe, are only imperfectly
   revealed in the Scriptures; that others are only obscurely intimated;
   and that others are not therein contained at all. The Preface to the
   Romish Catechism (Quest. 12) says, "Omnis doctrinæ ratio, quæ fidelibus
   tradenda sit, verbo Dei continetur, quod in scripturam traditionesque
   distributum est." Bellarmin [60] says expressly, "Nos asserimus, in
   Scripturis non contineri expressè totam doctrinam necessariam, sive de
   fide sive de moribus; et proinde praeter verbum Dei scriptum requiri
   etiam verbum Dei non-scriptum, i.e., divinas et apostolicas
   traditiones." On this point the Romish theologians are of one mind; but
   what the doctrines are, which are thus imperfectly revealed in the
   Scriptures, or merely implied, or entirely omitted, has never been
   authoritatively decided by the Church of Rome. The theologians of that
   Church, with more or less unanimity. refer to one or the other of these
   classes the following doctrines: (1.) The canon of Scripture. (2.) The
   inspiration of the sacred writers. (3.) The full doctrine of the
   Trinity. (4.) The personality and divinity of the Holy Spirit. (5.)
   Infant baptism (6.) The observance of Sunday as the Christian Sabbath.
   (7.) The threefold orders of the ministry. (8.) The government of the
   Church by bishops. (9.) The perpetuity of the apostleship. (10.) The
   grace of orders. (11.) The sacrificial nature of the Eucharist. (12.)
   The seven sacraments. (13.) Purgatory. It lies in the interests of the
   advocates of tradition to depreciate the Scriptures, and to show how
   much the Church would lose if she had no other source of knowledge of
   divine truth but the written word. On this subject the author of No. 85
   of the Oxford Tracts, when speaking even of essential doctrines, says,
   [61] "It is a near thing that they are in the Scriptures at all. The
   wonder is that they are all there. Humanly judging they would not be
   there but for God's interposition; and, therefore, since they are there
   by a sort of accident, it is not strange they shall be but latent
   there, and only indirectly producible thence." "The gospel doctrine,"
   says the same writer, "is but indirectly and covertly recorded in
   Scripture under the surface."

   Tradition is always represented by Romanists as not only the
   interpreter, but the complement of the Scriptures. The Bible,
   therefore, is, according to the Church of Rome, incomplete. It does not
   contain all the Church is bound to believe; nor are the doctrines which
   it does contain, therein fully or clearly made known.

   Obscurity of the Scriptures.

   3. The third point of difference between Romanists and Protestants
   relates to the perspicuity of Scripture, and the right of private
   judgment. Protestants hold that the Bible; being addressed to the
   people, is sufficiently perspicuous to be understood by them, under the
   guidance of the Holy Spirit; and that they are entitled and bound to
   search the Scriptures and to judge for themselves what is its true
   meaning. Romanists, on the other hand, teach that the Scriptures are so
   obscure that they need a visible, present, and infallible interpreter;
   and that the people, being incompetent to understand them, are bound to
   believe whatever doctrines the Church, through its official organs,
   declares to be true and divine. On this subject the Council of Trent
   (Sess. 4), says: "Ad coërcenda petulantia ingenia decernit (Synodus),
   ut nemo, suæ prudentiæ innixus in rebus fidei et morum ad ædificationem
   doctrinæ Christiana pertinentium, Sacram Scripturam ad suas sensus
   contorquens contra eum sensum, quem tenuit et tenet sancta mater
   Ecclesia, cujus est judicare de vero sensu et interpretatione
   Scripturarum Sanctarum, aut etiam contra unanimem consensum patrum
   ipsam scripturam sacram interpretari audeat, etiamsi hujus modi
   interpretationes nullo unquam tempore in lucem edendæ forent. Qui
   contravenerint, per ordinarios declarentur et poenis a jure statutis
   puniantur." Bellarmin [62] says: "Non ignorabat Deus multas in Ecclesia
   exorituras difficultates circa fidem, debuit igitur judicem aliquem
   Ecclesiæ providere. At iste judex non potest esse Scriptura, neque
   Spiritus revelans privatus, neque princeps secularis, igitur princeps
   ecclesiasticus vel solus vel certe cum consilio et consensu
   coepiscoporum."

   From this view of the obscurity of Scripture it follows that the use of
   the sacred volume by the people, is discountenanced by the Church of
   Rome, although its use has never been prohibited by any General
   Council. Such prohibitions, however, have repeatedly been issued by the
   Popes; as by Gregory VII., Innocent III., Clemens XI., and Pius IV.,
   who made the liberty to read any vernacular version of the Scriptures,
   dependent on the permission of the priest. There have been, however,
   many Romish prelates and theologians who encouraged the general reading
   of the Bible. The spirit of the Latin Church and the effects of its
   teaching, are painfully manifested by the fact that the Scriptures are
   practically inaccessible to the mass of the people in strictly Roman
   Catholic countries.

   The Latin Vulgate.

   4. The fourth point of difference concerns the authority due to the
   Latin Vulgate. On this subject the Council of Trent (Sess. 4), says:
   "Synodus considerans non parum utilitatis accedere posse Ecclesiæ Dei,
   si ex omnibus Latinis editionibus quæ circumferentur, sacrorum
   librorum, quænam pro authentica habenda sit, innotescat: statuit et
   declarat, ut hæc ipsa vetus et vulgata editio, quæ longo tot seculorum
   usu in ipsa Ecclesia probata est, in publicis lectionibus,
   disputationibus, prædicationibus et expositionibus pro authentica
   habeatur et nemo illam rejicere quovis prætextu audeat vel præsumat."
   The meaning of this decree is a matter of dispute among Romanists
   themselves. Some of the more modern and liberal of their theologians
   say that the Council simply intended to determine which among several
   Latin versions was to be used in the service of the Church. They
   contend that it was not meant to forbid appeal to the original
   Scriptures, or to place the Vulgate on a par with them in authority.
   The earlier and stricter Romanists take the ground that the Synod did
   intend to forbid an appeal to the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures, and to
   make the Vulgate the ultimate authority. The language of the Council
   seems to favor this interpretation. The Vulgate was to be used not only
   for the ordinary purposes of public instruction, but in all theological
   discussions, and in all works of exegesis.

   § 3. Tradition.

   The word tradition (paradosis) means, (1.) The art of delivering over
   from one to another. (2.) The thing delivered or communicated. In the
   New Testament it is used (a.)For instructions delivered from some to
   others, without reference to the mode of delivery, whether it be orally
   or by writing; as in 2 Thess. ii. 15, "Hold the traditions which ye
   have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle;" and iii. 6,
   "Withdraw yourself from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not
   after the tradition which he received of us." (b.) For the oral
   instructions of the fathers handed down from generation to generation,
   but not contained in the Scriptures, and yet regarded as authoritative.
   In this sense our Lord so frequently speaks of "the traditions of the
   Pharisees." (c.) In Gal. i. 14, where Paul speaks of his zeal for the
   traditions of his fathers, it may include both the written and
   unwritten instructions which he had received. What he was so zealous
   about, was the whole system of Judaism as he had been taught it.

   In the early Church the word was used in this wide sense. Appeal was
   constantly made to "the traditions," i.e., the instructions which the
   churches had received. It was only certain churches at first which had
   any of the written instructions of the Apostles. And it was not until
   the end of the first century that the writings of the Evangelists and
   Apostles were collected, and formed into a canon, or rule of faith. And
   when the books of the New Testament had been collected, the fathers
   spoke of them as containing the traditions, i.e., the instructions
   derived from Christ and his Apostles. They called the Gospels "the
   evangelical traditions," and the Epistles "the apostolical traditions."
   In that age of the Church the distinction between the written and
   unwritten word had not yet been distinctly made. But as controversies
   arose, and disputants on both sides of all questions appealed to
   "tradition," i.e., to what they had been taught; and when it was found
   that these traditions differed, one church saying their teachers had
   always taught them one thing, and another that theirs had taught them
   the opposite, it was felt that there should be some common and
   authoritative standard. Hence the wisest and best of the fathers
   insisted on abiding by the written word, and receiving nothing as of
   divine authority not contained therein. In this, however, it must be
   confessed they were not always consistent. Whenever prescription,
   usage, or conviction founded on unwritten evidence, was available
   against an adversary, they did not hesitate to make the most of it.
   During all the early centuries, therefore, the distinction between
   Scripture and tradition was not so sharply drawn as it has been since
   the controversies between Romanists and Protestants, and especially
   since the decisions of the Council of Trent.

   Tridentine Doctrine.

   That Council, and the Latin Church as a body, teach on this subject, --
   (1.) That Christ and his Apostles taught many things which were not
   committed to writing, i.e., not recorded in the Sacred Scriptures. (2.)
   That these instructions have been faithfully transmitted, and preserved
   in the Church. (3.) That they constitute a part of the rule of faith
   for all believers.

   These particulars are included in the following extracts from the acts
   of the Council: "Synodus -- perspiciens hanc veritatem et disciplinam
   contineri in libris scriptis et sine scripto traditionibus, quæ ex
   ipsius Christi ore ab apostolis acceptæ, aut ab ipsis apostolis,
   Spiritu Sancto dictante, quasi per manus traditæ, ad nos usque
   pervenerunt; orthodoxorum patrum exempla secuta, omnes libros tam
   Veteris quam Novi Testamenti, cum utriusque unus Deus sit auctor, nec
   non traditiones ipsas, tum ad fidem tum ad mores pertinentes, tanquam
   vel ore tenus a Christo, vel a Spiritu Sancto dictatas, et continua
   successione in Ecclesia Catholica conservatas, pari pietatis affectu et
   reverentia suscipit et veneratur." [63]

   Bellarmin [64] divides traditions into three classes: divine,
   apostolical, and ecclesiastical. "Divinæ dicuntur quæ acceptæ sunt ab
   ipso Christo apostolos docente, et nusquam in divinis literis in
   veniuntur. . . . . Apostolicæ traditiones proprie dicuntur illæ, quæ ab
   apostolis institutæ sunt, non tamen sine assistentia Spiritus Sancti et
   nihilominus non extant scriptæ in eorum epistolis. . . . .
   Ecclesiasticæ traditiones proprie dicuntur consuetudines quædam antiquæ
   vel a prælatis vel a populis inchoatæ, quæ paulatim tacito consensu
   populorum vim legis obtinuerunt. Et quidem traditiones divinæ eandem
   vim habent, quam divinae præcepta sive divina doctrina scripta in
   Evangeliis. Et similiter apostolicæ traditiones non scriptæ eandem vim
   habent, quam apostolica, traditiones scriptæ. . . . . Ecclesiasticæ
   autem traditiones eandem vim habent, quam decreta et constitutiones
   ecclesiasticæ, scriptæ."

   Petrus à Soto, quoted by Chemnitz [65] says, "Infallibilis est regula
   et catholica. Quacunque credit, tenet, et servat Romana Ecclesia, et in
   Scripturis non habentur, illa ab apostolis esse tradita; item quarum
   observationum initium, author et origo ignoretur, vel inveniri non
   potest, illas extra omnem dubitationem ab apostolis tradita esse."

   From this it appears, 1. That these traditions are called unwritten
   because not contained in the Scriptures. They are, for the most part,
   now to be found written in the works of the Fathers, decisions of
   councils, ecclesiastical constitutions, and rescripts of the Popes.

   2. The office of tradition is to convey a knowledge of doctrines,
   precepts, and institutions not contained in Scripture; and also to
   serve as a guide to the proper understanding of what is therein
   written. Tradition, therefore, in the Church of Rome, is both the
   supplement and interpretation of the written word.

   3. The authority due to tradition is the same as that which belongs to
   the Scriptures. Both are to be received "pari pietatis affectu et
   reverentia." Both are derived from the same source; both are received
   through the same channel; and both are authenticated by the same
   witness. This authority, however, belongs properly only to traditions
   regarded as divine or apostolical. Those termed ecclesiastical are of
   less importance, relating to rites and usages. Still for them is
   claimed an authority virtually divine, as they are enjoined by a church
   which claims to have been endowed by Christ with full power to ordain
   rites and ceremonies.

   4. The criteria by which to distinguish between true and false
   traditions, are either antiquity and catholicity, or the testimony of
   the extant Church. Sometimes the one, and sometimes the other is urged.
   The Council of Trent gives the former; so does Bellarmin, and so do the
   majority of Romish theologians. This is the famous rule established by
   Vincent of Lerins in the fifth century, "quod semper, quod ubique, quod
   ab omnibus." On all occasions, however, the ultimate appeal is to the
   decision of the Church. Whatever the Church declares to be a part of
   the revelation committed to her, is to be received as of divine
   authority, at the peril of salvation.

   § 4. The Office of the Church as Teacher.

   1. Romanists define the Church to be the company of men professing the
   same faith, united in the communion of the same sacraments, subject to
   lawful pastors, and specially to the Pope. By the first clause they
   exclude from the Church all infidels and heretics; by the second, all
   the unbaptized; by the third, all who are not subject to bishops having
   canonical succession; and by the fourth, all who do not acknowledge the
   Bishop of Rome to be the head of the Church on earth. It is this
   external, visible society thus constituted, that God has made an
   authoritative and infallible teacher.

   2. The Church is qualified for this office: first, by the communication
   of all the revelations of God, written and unwritten; and secondly, by
   the constant presence and guidance of the Holy Spirit preserving it
   from all error in its instructions. On this point the "Roman
   Catechism," [66] says: "Quemadmodum hæc una Ecclesia errare non potest
   in fidei ac morum disciplina tradenda, cum a Spiritu Sancto gubernetur;
   ita ceteras omnes, quæ sibi ecclesiæ nomen arrogant, ut quæ Diaboli
   spiritu ducantur, in doctrinæ et morum perniciosissimis erroribus
   versari necesse est." And Bellarmin, [67] "Nostra sententia est
   Ecclesiam absolute non posse errare nec in rebus absolute necessariis
   nec in aliis, quæ credenda vel facienda nobis proponit, sive habeantur
   expresse in Scripturis, sive non."

   3. The Church, according to these statements, is infallible only as to
   matters of faith and morals. Its infallibility does not extend over the
   domains of history, philosophy, or science. Some theologians would even
   limit the infallibility of the Church, to essential doctrines. But the
   Church of Rome does not make the distinction, recognised by all
   Protestants, between essential and non-essential doctrines. With
   Romanists, that is essential, or necessary, which the Church pronounces
   to be a part of the revelation of God. Bellarmin -- than whom there is
   no greater authority among Romish theologians -- says that the Church
   can err "nec in rebus absolute necessariis nec in aliis," i.e., neither
   in things in their own nature necessary, nor in those which become
   necessary when determined and enjoined. It has been disputed among
   Romanists, whether the Church is infallible in matters of fact as well
   as in matters of doctrine. By facts, in this discussion, are not meant
   facts of history or science, but facts involved in doctrinal decisions.
   When the Pope condemned certain propositions taken from the works of
   Jansenius, his disciples had to admit that those propositions were
   erroneous; but they denied that they were contained, in the sense
   condemned, in the writings of their master. To this the Jesuits
   replied, that the infallibility of the Church extended in such cases as
   much to the fact as to the doctrine. This the Jansenists denied.

   The Organs of the Church's Infallibility.

   4. As to the organs of the Church in its infallible teaching, there are
   two theories, the Episcopal and Papal, or, as they are designated from
   their principal advocates, the Gallican and the Transmontane. According
   to the former, the bishops, in their collective capacity, as the
   official successors of the Apostles, are infallible as teachers.
   Individual bishops may err, the body or college of bishops cannot err.
   Whatever the bishops of any age of the Church unite in teaching, is,
   for that age, the rule of faith. This concurrence of judgment need not
   amount to entire unanimity. The greater part, the common judgment of
   the episcopate, is all that is required. To their decision all
   dissentients are bound to submit. This general judgment may be
   pronounced in a council, representing the whole Church, or in any other
   way in which agreement may be satisfactorily indicated. Acquiescence in
   the decisions of even a provincial council, or of the Pope, or the
   several bishops, each in his own diocese, teaching the same doctrine,
   is sufficient proof of consent.

   The Transmontane Theory.

   According to the Papal, or Transmontane theory, the Pope is the organ
   through which the infallible judgment of the Church is pronounced. He
   is the vicar of Christ. He is not subject to a general council. He is
   not required to consult other bishops before he gives his decision.
   This infallibility is not personal, but official. As a man the Pope may
   be immoral, heretical, or infidel; as Pope, when speaking ex cathedra,
   he is the organ of the Holy Ghost. The High-Priest among the Jews might
   be erroneous in faith, or immoral in conduct, but when consulting God
   in his official capacity, he was the mere organ of divine
   communication. Such, in few words, is the doctrine of Romanists
   concerning the Rule of Faith.

   In the recent Ecumenical Council, held in the Vatican, after a
   protracted struggle, the Transmontane doctrine was sanctioned. It is,
   therefore, now obligatory on all Romanists to believe that the Pope,
   when speaking ex cathedra, is infallible.

   § 5. Examination of the Romish Doctrine.

   Hundreds of volumes have been written in the discussion of the various
   points included in the theory above stated. Only a most cursory view of
   the controversy can be given in such a work as this. So far as
   Romanists differ from us on the canon of Scripture, the examination of
   their views belongs to the department of Biblical literature. What
   concerns their doctrine of the incompleteness and obscurity of the
   written word, and the consequent necessity of an infallible, visible
   interpreter, can better be said under the head of the Protestant
   doctrine of the Rule of Faith. The two points to be now considered are
   Tradition and the office of the Church as a teacher. These subjects are
   so related that it is difficult to keep them distinct. Tradition is the
   teaching of the Church, and the teaching of the Church is tradition.
   These subjects are not only thus intimately related, but they are
   generally included under the same head in the Catholic Symbols.
   Nevertheless, they are distinct, and involve very different principles.
   They should, therefore, be considered separately.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 6. Examination of the Doctrine of the Church of Rome on Tradition.

   A. Difference between Tradition and the Analogy of Faith.

   1. The Romish doctrine of tradition differs essentially from the
   Protestant doctrine of the analogy of faith. Protestants admit that
   there is a kind of tradition within the limits of the sacred Scriptures
   themselves. One generation of sacred writers received the whole body of
   truth taught by those who preceded them. There was a tradition of
   doctrine, a traditionary usus loquendi, traditionary figures, types,
   and symbols. The revelation of God in his Word begins in a fountain,
   and flows in a continuous stream ever increasing in volume. We are
   governed by this tradition of truth running through the whole sacred
   volume. All is consistent. One part cannot contradict another. Each
   part must be interpreted so as to bring it into harmony with the whole.
   This is only saying that Scripture must explain Scripture.

   2. Again, Protestants admit that as there has been an uninterrupted
   tradition of truth from the protevangelium to the close; of the
   Apocalypse, so there has been a stream of traditionary teaching flowing
   through the Christian Church from the day of Pentecost to the present
   time. This tradition is so far a rule of faith that nothing contrary to
   it can be true. Christians do not stand isolated, each holding his own
   creed. They constitute one body, having one common creed. Rejecting
   that creed, or any of its parts, is the rejection of the fellowship of
   Christians, incompatible with the communion of saints, or membership in
   the body of Christ. In other words, Protestants admit that there is a
   common faith of the Church, which no man is at liberty to reject, and
   which no man can reject and be a Christian. They acknowledge the
   authority of this common faith for two reasons. First, because what all
   the competent readers of a plain book take to be its meaning, must be
   its meaning. Secondly, because the Holy Spirit is promised to guide the
   people of God into the knowledge of the truth, and therefore that which
   they, under the teachings of the Spirit, agree in believing must be
   true. There are certain fixed doctrines among Christians, as there are
   among Jews and Mohammedans, which are no longer open questions. The
   doctrines of the Trinity, of the divinity and incarnation of the
   eternal Son of God; of the personality and divinity of the Holy Spirit;
   of the apostasy and sinfulness of the human race; the doctrines of the
   expiation of sin through the death of Christ and of salvation through
   his merits; of regeneration and sanctification by the Holy Ghost; of
   the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and of the life
   everlasting, have always entered into the faith of every recognized,
   historical church on the face of the earth, and cannot now be
   legitimately called into question by any pretending to be Christians.

   Some of the more philosophical of the Romish theologians would have us
   believe that this is all they mean by tradition. They insist, they say,
   only on the authority of common consent. Thus Moehler, Professor of
   Theology at Munich, in his "Symbolik, oder Darstellung der Dogmatischen
   Gegensätze," says, "Tradition, in the subjective sense of the word, is
   the common faith, or consciousness of the Church." [68] "The
   ever-living word in the hearts of believers." [69] It is, he says, what
   Eusebius means by by ekklesiastikon phronema; what Vincent of Lerins
   intends by the ecclesiastica intelligentia, and the Council of Trent by
   the universus ecelesicæ sensus. "In the objective sense of the word,"
   Moehler says that "Tradition is the common faith of the Church as
   presented in external, historical witnesses through all centuries." "In
   this latter sense," he tells us, "tradition is commonly viewed when
   spoken of as a guide to the interpretation of the rule of Faith." [70]
   He admits that in this sense "Tradition contains nothing beyond what is
   taught in Scripture; the two as to their content, are one and the
   same." [71] Nevertheless, he acknowledges that in the Church of Rome
   many things were handed down from the Apostles which are not contained
   in the Scriptures. This fact he does not deny. He admits that such
   additional revelations, or such revelations in addition to those
   contained in the written word, are of the highest importance. But he
   soon dismisses the subject, and devotes his strength to the
   first-mentioned view of the nature and office of tradition, and holds
   that up as the peculiar doctrine of Romanism as opposed to the
   Protestant doctrine. Protestants, however, admit the fact and the
   authority of a common consciousness and a common faith, or common sense
   of the Church, while they reject the real and peculiar doctrine of Rome
   on this subject.

   B. Points of Difference between the Romish Doctrine and that of
   Protestants on Common Consent.

   The points of difference between the Protestant doctrine concerning the
   common faith of the Church and the Roman Catholic doctrine of tradition
   are: --

   First. When Protestants speak of common consent of Christians, they
   understand by Christians the true people of God. Romanists on the other
   hand, mean the company of those who profess the true faith, and who are
   subject to the Pope of Rome. There is the greatest possible difference
   between the authority due to the common faith of truly regenerated,
   holy men, the temples of the Holy Ghost, and that due to what a society
   of nominal Christians profess to believe, the great majority of whom
   may be worldly, immoral, and irreligious.

   Secondly. The common consent for which Protestants plead concerns only
   essential doctrines; that is, doctrines which enter into the very
   nature of Christianity as a religion, and which are necessary to its
   subjective existence in the heart, or which if they do not enter
   essentially into the religious experience of believers, are so
   connected with vital doctrines as not to admit of separation from them.
   Romanists, on the contrary, plead the authority of tradition for all
   kinds of doctrines and precepts, for rites and ceremonies, and
   ecclesiastical institutions, which have nothing to do with the life of
   the Church, and are entirely outside of the sphere of the promised
   guidance of the Spirit. Our Lord, in promising the Spirit to guide his
   people into the knowledge of truths necessary to their salvation, did
   not promise to preserve them from error in subordinate matters, or to
   give them supernatural knowledge of the organization of the Church, the
   number of the sacraments, or the power of bishops. The two theories,
   therefore, differ not only as to the class of persons who are guided by
   the Spirit, but also as to the class of subjects in relation to which
   that guidance is promised.

   Thirdly. A still more important difference is, that the common faith of
   the Church for which Protestants contend, is faith in doctrines plainly
   revealed in Scripture. It does not extend beyond those doctrines. It
   owes its whole authority to the fact that it is a common understanding
   of the written word, attained and preserved under that teaching of the
   Spirit, which secures to believers a competent knowledge of the plan of
   salvation therein revealed. On the other hand, tradition is with the
   Romanists entirely independent of the Scriptures. They plead for a
   common consent in doctrines not contained in the Word of God, or which
   cannot be proved therefrom.

   Fourthly. Protestants do not regard "common consent" either as an
   informant or as a ground of faith. With them the written word is the
   only source of knowledge of what God has revealed for our salvation,
   and his testimony therein is the only ground of our faith. Whereas,
   with Romanists, tradition is not only an informant of what is to be
   believed, but the witness on whose testimony faith is to be yielded. It
   is one thing to say that the fact that all the true people of God,
   under the guidance of the Spirit, believe that certain doctrines are
   taught in Scripture, is an unanswerable argument that they are really
   taught therein, and quite another thing to say that because an external
   society, composed of all sorts of men, to whom no promise of divine
   guidance has been given, agree in holding certain doctrines, therefore
   we are bound to receive those doctrines as part of the revelation of
   God.

   C. Tradition and Development.

   The Romish doctrine of tradition is not to be confounded with the
   modern doctrine of development. All Protestants admit that there has
   been, in one sense, an uninterrupted development of theology in the
   Church, from the apostolic age to the present time. All the facts,
   truths, doctrines, and principles, which enter into Christian theology,
   are in the Bible. They are there as fully and is clearly at one time as
   at another; at the beginning as they are now. No addition has been made
   to their number, and no new explanation has been afforded of their
   nature or relations. The same is true of the facts of nature. They are
   now what they have been from the beginning. They are, however, far
   better known, and more clearly understood now than they were a thousand
   years ago. The mechanism of the heavens was the same in the days of
   Pythagoras as it was in those of La Place; and yet the astronomy of the
   latter was immeasurably in advance of that of the former. The change
   was effected by a continual and gradual progress. The same progress has
   taken place in theological knowledge. Every believer is conscious of
   such progress in his own experience. When he was a child, he thought as
   a child. As he grew in years, he grew in knowledge of the Bible. He
   increased not only in the compass, but in the clearness, order, and
   harmony of his knowledge. This is just as true of the Church
   collectively as of the individual Christian. It is, in the first place,
   natural, if not inevitable, that it should be so. The Bible, although
   so clear and simple in its teaching, that he who runs may read and
   learn enough to secure his salvation, is still full of the treasures of
   the wisdom and knowledge of God; full of ta bathe tou theou, the
   profoundest truths concerning all the great problems which have taxed
   the intellect of man from the beginning. These truths are not
   systematically stated, but scattered, so to speak, promiscuously over
   the sacred pages, just as the facts of science are scattered over the
   face of nature, or hidden in its depths. Every man knows that there is
   unspeakably more in the Bible than he has yet learned, as every man of
   science knows that there is unspeakably more in nature than he has yet
   discovered, or understands. It stands to reason that such a book, being
   the subject of devout and laborious study, century after century, by
   able and faithful men, should come to be better and better understood.
   And as in matters of science, although one false theory after another,
   founded on wrong principles or on an imperfect induction of facts, has
   passed away, yet real progress is made, and the ground once gained is
   never lost, so we should naturally expect it to be with the study of
   the Bible. False views, false inferences, misapprehensions, ignoring of
   some facts, and misinterpretations, might be expected to come and go,
   in endless succession, but nevertheless a steady progress in the
   knowledge of what the Bible teaches be accomplished. And we might also
   expect that here, too, the ground once surely gained would not again be
   lost.

   But, in the second place, what is thus natural and reasonable in itself
   is a patent historical fact. The Church has thus advanced in
   theological knowledge. The difference between the confused and
   discordant representations of the early fathers on all subjects
   connected with the doctrines of the Trinity and of the person of
   Christ, and the clearness, precision, and consistency of the views
   presented after ages of discussion, and the statement of these
   doctrines by the Councils of Chalcedon and Constantinople, is as great
   almost as between chaos and cosmos. And this ground has never been
   lost. The same is true with regard to the doctrines of sin and grace.
   Before the long-continued discussion of these subjects in the
   Augustinian period, the greatest confusion and contradiction prevailed
   in the teachings of the leaders of the Church; during those discussions
   the views of the Church became clear and settled. There is scarcely a
   principle or doctrine concerning the fall of man, the nature of sin and
   guilt, inability, the necessity of the Spirits influence, etc., etc.,
   which now enters into the faith of evangelical Christians, which was
   not then clearly stated and authoritatively sanctioned by the Church.
   In like manner, before the Reformation, similar confusion existed with
   regard to the great doctrine of justification. No clear line of
   discrimination was drawn between it and sanctification. Indeed, during
   the Middle Ages, and among the most devout of the schoolmen, the idea
   of guilt was merged in the general idea of sin, and sin regarded as
   merely moral defilement. The great object was to secure holiness. Then
   pardon would come of course. The apostolic, Pauline, deeply Scriptural
   doctrine, that there can be no holiness until sin be expiated, that
   pardon, justification, and reconciliation, must precede sanctification,
   was never clearly apprehended. This was the grand lesson which the
   Church learned at the Reformation, and which it has never since forgot.
   It is true then, as an historical fact, that the Church has advanced.
   It understands the great doctrines of theology, anthropology, and
   soteriology, far better now, than they were understood in the early
   post-apostolic age of the Church.

   Modern Theory of Development.

   Very distinct from the view above presented is the modern theory of the
   organic development of the Church. This modern theory is avowedly
   founded on the pantheistic principles of Schelling and Hegel. With them
   the universe is the self-manifestation and evolution of the absolute
   Spirit. Dr. Schaff [72] says, that this theory "has left an impression
   on German science that can never be effaced; and has contributed more
   than any other influence to diffuse a clear conception of the interior
   organism of history." In his work on the "Principles of Protestantism,"
   [73] Dr. Schaff says that Schelling and Hegel taught the world to
   recognize in history "the ever opening sense of eternal thoughts, an
   always advancing rational development of the idea of humanity, and its
   relations to God." This theory of historical development was adopted,
   and partially Christianized by Schleiermacher, from whom it has passed
   over to Dr. Schaff, as set forth in his work above quoted, as well as
   to many other equally devout and excellent men. The basis of this
   modified theory is realism. Humanity is a generic life, an intelligent
   substance. That life became guilty and polluted in Adam. From him it
   passed over by a process of natural, organic development (the same
   numerical life and substance) to all his posterity, who therefore are
   guilty and polluted. This generic life the Son of God assumed into
   union with his divine nature, and thus healed it and raised it to a
   higher power or order. He becomes a new starting-point. The origin of
   this new form of life in Him is supernatural. The constitution of his
   person was a miracle. But from Him this life is communicated by a
   natural process of development to the Church. Its members are partakers
   of this new generic life. It is, however, a germ. What ever lives
   grows. "Whatever is done is dead." This new life is Christianity.
   Christianity is not a form of doctrine objectively revealed in the
   Scriptures. Christian theology is not the knowledge, or systematic
   exhibition of what the Bible teaches. It is the interpretation of this
   inner life. The intellectual life of a child expressed itself in one
   way, of a boy in another way, and of a man in another and higher way.
   In each stage of his progress the man has views, feelings, and modes of
   thinking, appropriate to that stage. It would not do for a man to have
   the same views and thoughts as the child. Yet the latter are just as
   true, as right, and as proper, for the child, as those of the man for
   the man. It is thus with the Church. It passes through these stages of
   childhood, youth, and manhood, by a regular process. During the first
   centuries the Church had the indistinctness, vagueness, and
   exaggeration of views and doctrines, belonging to a period of infancy.
   In the Middle Ages it had a higher form. At the Reformation it advanced
   to the entrance on another stage. The form assumed by Christianity
   during the mediæval period, was for that period the true and proper,
   but not the permanent form. We have not reached that form as to
   doctrine yet. That will be reached in the Church of the future.

   Development as held by some Romanists.

   There is still another and very different form of the doctrine of
   development. It does not assume the Mystical doctrine of the indwelling
   of the substance of Christ, in the soul, the development of which works
   out its illumination in the knowledge of the truth, and finally its
   complete redemption. It admits that Christianity is, or includes a
   system of doctrine, and that those doctrines are in the Scriptures; but
   holds that many of them are there only in their rudiments. Under the
   constant guidance and tuition of the Spirit, the Church comes to
   understand all that these rudiments contain, and to expand them in
   their fulness. Thus the Lord's Supper has been expanded into the
   doctrine of transubstantiation and the sacrifice of the mass; anointing
   the sick, into the sacrament of extreme unction; rules of discipline
   into the sacrament of penance, of satisfactions, of indulgences, of
   purgatory, and masses and prayers for the dead; the prominence of
   Peter, into the supremacy of the Pope. The Old Testament contains the
   germ of all the doctrines unfolded in the New; and so the New Testament
   contains the germs of all the doctrines unfolded, under the guidance of
   the Spirit, in the theology of the mediæval Church.

   Although attempts have been made by some Romanists and Anglicans to
   resolve the doctrine of tradition into one or other of these theories
   of development, they are essentially different. The only point of
   analogy between them is, that in both cases, little becomes much.
   Tradition has made contributions to the faith and institutions of the
   Christian Church; and development (in the two latter forms of the
   doctrine above mentioned) provides for a similar expansion.

   The Real Question.

   The real status quæstionis, on this subject, as between Romanists and
   Protestants, is not (1) Whether the Spirit of God leads true believers
   into the knowledge of the truth; nor (2) whether true Christians agree
   in all essential matters as to truth and duty; nor (3) whether any man
   can safely or innocently dissent from this common faith of the people
   of God; but (4) whether apart from the revelation contained in the
   Bible, there is another supplementary and explanatory revelation, which
   has been handed down outside of the Scriptures, by tradition. In other
   words, whether there are doctrines, institutions, and ordinances,
   having no warrant in the Scriptures, which we as Christians are bound
   to receive and obey on the authority of what is called common consent.
   This Romanists affirm and Protestants deny.

   D. Arguments against the Doctrine of Tradition.

   The heads of argument against the Romish doctrine on this subject are
   the following: --

   I. It involves a natural impossibility. It is of course conceded that
   Christ and his Apostles said and did much that is not recorded in the
   Scriptures; and it is further admitted that if we had any certain
   knowledge of such unrecorded instructions, they would be of equal
   authority with what is written in the Scriptures. But Protestants
   maintain that they were not intended to constitute a part of the
   permanent rule of faith to the Church. They were designed for the men
   of that generation. The showers which fell a thousand years ago,
   watered the earth and rendered it fruitful for men then living. They
   cannot now be gathered up and made available for us. They did not
   constitute a reservoir for the supply of future generations. In like
   manner the unrecorded teachings of Christ and his Apostles did their
   work. They were not designed for our instruction. It is as impossible
   to learn what they were, as it is to gather up the leaves which adorned
   and enriched the earth when Christ walked in the garden of Gethsemane.
   This impossibility arises out of the limitations of our nature, as well
   as its corruption consequent on the fall. Man has not the clearness of
   perception, the retentiveness of memory, or the power of presentation,
   to enable him (without supernatural aid) to give a trustworthy account
   of a discourse once heard, a few years or even months after its
   delivery. And that this should be done over and over from month to
   month for thousands of years, is an impossibility. If to this be added
   the difficulty in the way of this oral transmission, arising from the
   blindness of men to the things of the Spirit, which prevents their
   understanding what they hear, and from the disposition to pervert and
   misrepresent the truth to suit their own prejudices and purposes, it
   must be acknowledged that tradition cannot be a reliable source of
   knowledge of religious truth. This is universally acknowledged and
   acted upon, except by Romanists. No one pretends to determine what
   Luther and Calvin, Latimer and Cranmer, taught, except from
   contemporaneous written records. Much less will any sane man pretend to
   know what Moses and the prophets taught except from their own writings.

   Romanists admit the force of this objection. They admit that tradition
   would not be a trustworthy informant of what Christ and the Apostles
   taught, without the supernatural intervention of God. Tradition is to
   be trusted not because it comes down through the hands of fallible men,
   but because it comes through an infallibly guided Church. This,
   however, is giving up the question. It is merging the authority of
   tradition into the authority of the Church. There is no need of the
   former, if the latter be admitted. Romanists, however, keep these two
   things distinct. They say that if the Gospels had never been written,
   they would know by historical tradition the facts of Christ's life; and
   that if his discourses and the epistles of the Apostles had never been
   gathered up and recorded, they would by the same means know the truths
   which they contain. They admit, however, that this could not be without
   a special divine intervention.

   No Promise of Divine Intervention.

   2. The second objection of Protestants to this theory is, that it is
   unphilosophical and irreligious to assume a supernatural intervention
   on the part of God, without promise and without proof, merely to suit a
   purpose, -- Deus ex machina.

   Our Lord promised to preserve his Church from fatal apostasy; He
   promised to send his Spirit to abide with his people, to teach them; He
   promised that He would be with them to the end of the world. But these
   promises were not made to any external, visible organization of
   professing Christians, whether Greek or Latin; nor did they imply that
   any such Church should be preserved from all error in faith or
   practice; much less do they imply that instructions not recorded by the
   dictation of the Spirit, should be preserved and transmitted from
   generation to generation. There is no such promise in the Word of God,
   and as such preservation and transmission without divine, supernatural
   interposition, would be impossible, tradition cannot be a trustworthy
   informant of what Christ taught.

   No Criterion.

   3. Romanists again admit that many false traditions have prevailed in
   different ages and in different parts of the Church. Those who receive
   them are confident of their genuineness, and zealous in their support.
   How shall the line be drawn between the true and false? By what
   criterion can the one be distinguished from the other? Protestants say
   there is no such criterion, and therefore, if the authority of
   tradition be admitted, the Church is exposed to a flood of superstition
   and error. This is their third argument against the Romish doctrine on
   this subject. Romanists, however say they have a sure criterion in
   antiquity and universality. They have formulated their rule of judgment
   in the famous dictum of Vincent of Lerins: "Quod semper, quod ubique,
   quod ab omnibus."

   Common Consent not a Criterion.

   To this Protestants reply, -- First, That they admit the authority of
   common consent among true Christians as to what is taught in the
   Scriptures. So far as all the true people of God agree in their
   interpretation of the Bible, we acknowledge ourselves bound to submit.
   But this consent is of authority only, (a) So far as it is the consent
   of true believers; (b) So far as it concerns the meaning of the written
   word; and, (c) So far as it relates to the practical, experimental, or
   essential doctrines of Christianity. Such consent as to matters outside
   of the Bible, or even supposed to be in the Bible, if they do not
   concern the foundation of our faith, is of no decisive weight. The
   whole Christian world, without one dissenting voice, believed for ages
   that the Bible taught that the sun moves round the earth. No man now
   believes it.

   Secondly, Common consent as to Christian doctrine cannot be pleaded
   except within narrow limits. It is only on the gratuitous and monstrous
   assumption that Romanists are the only Christians, that the least
   plausibility can be given to the claim of common consent. The argument
   is really this: The Church of Rome receives certain doctrines on the
   authority of tradition. The Church of Rome includes all true
   Christians. Therefore, the common consent of all Christians may be
   claimed in favour of those doctrines.

   But, thirdly, admitting that the Church of Rome is the whole Church,
   and admitting that Church to be unanimous in holding certain doctrines,
   that is no proof that that Church has always held them. The rule
   requires that a doctrine must be held not only ab omnibus, but semper.
   It is, however, a historical fact that all the peculiar doctrines of
   Romanism were not received in the early Church as matters of faith.
   Such doctrines as the supremacy of the Bishop of Rome; the perpetuity
   of the apostleship, the grace of orders; transubstantiation; the
   propitiatory sacrifice of the Mass; the power of the priests to forgive
   sins; the seven sacraments; purgatory: the immaculate conception of the
   Virgin Mary, etc., etc., can all be historically traced in their
   origin, gradual development, and final adoption. As it would be unjust
   to determine the theology of Calvin and Beza from the Socinianism of
   modern Geneva; or that of Luther from the theology of the Germans of
   our day; so it is utterly unreasonable to infer that because the Latin
   Church believes all that the Council of Trent pronounced to be true,
   that such was its faith in the first centuries of its history. It is
   not to be denied that for the first hundred years after the Reformation
   the Church of England was Calvinistic; then under Archbishop Laud and
   the Stuarts it became almost thoroughly Romanized; then it became to a
   large extent Rationalistic, so that Bishop Burnet said of the men of
   his day, that Christianity seemed to be regarded as a fable "among all
   persons of discernment." To this succeeded a general revival of
   evangelical doctrine and piety, and that has been followed by a like
   revival of Romanism and Ritualism. Mr. Newman [74] says of the present
   time: "In the Church of England, we shall hardly find ten or twenty
   neighboring clergymen who agree together; and that, not in
   non-essentials of religion, but as to what are its elementary and
   necessary doctrines; or as to the fact whether there are any necessary
   doctrines at all, any distinct and definite faith required for
   salvation." Such is the testimomly of history. In no external, visible
   Church, has there been a consent to any form of faith, semper et ab
   omnibus.

   The Latin Church is no exception to this remark. It is an undeniable
   fact of history that Arianism prevailed for years both in the East and
   West; that it received the sanction of the vast majority of the
   bishops, of provincial and ecumenical councils, and of the Bishop of
   Rome. It is no less certain that in the Latin Church, Augustinianism,
   including all the characteristic doctrines of what is now called
   Calvinism, was declared to be the true faith by council after council,
   provincial and general, and by bishops and popes. Soon, however,
   Augustinianism lost its ascendency. For seven or eight centuries no one
   form of doctrine concerning sin, grace, and predestination prevailed in
   the Latin Church. Augustinianism, Semi-Pelagianism, and Mysticism
   (equally irreconcilable with both), were in constant conflict; and
   that, too, on questions on which the Church had already pronounced its
   judgment. It was not until the beginning of the sixteenth century that
   the Council of Trent, after long conflict within itself, gave its
   sanction to a modified form of Semi-Pelagianism.

   The claim, therefore, for common consent, as understood by Romanists,
   is contrary to history. It is inconsistent with undeniable facts. This
   is virtually admitted by Romanists themselves. For with them it is
   common to say, We believe because the fifth century believed. But this
   is a virtual admission that their peculiar faith is not historically
   traceable beyond the fifth century. This admission of a want of all
   historical evidence of "common consent" is also involved, as before
   remarked, in their constant appeal to the authority of the Church. What
   the Church says is a matter of faith, we, the traditionists affirm, are
   bound to believe, has always been a matter of faith. The passage from
   "Petrus á Soto," quoted above, puts the case very concisely: "Quæcunque
   credit, tenet et servat Romana ecclesia, et in Scripturis non habentur
   illa ab Apostolis esse tradita." The argument amounts to this. The
   Church believes on the ground of common consent. The proof that a thing
   is a matter of common consent, and always has been, is that the Church
   now believes it.

   Inadequacy of the Evidences of Consent.

   The second objection to the argument of Romanists from common consent
   in support of their traditions, is, that the evidence which they adduce
   of such consent is altogether inadequate. They appeal to the ancient
   creeds. But there was no creed generally adopted before the fourth
   century. No creed adopted before the eighth century contains any of the
   doctrines peculiar to the Church of Rome. Protestants all receive the
   doctrinal statements contained in what is called the Apostles' creed,
   and in those of Chalcedon and of Constantinople, adopted A.D. 681.

   They appeal also to the decisions of councils. To this the same reply
   is made. There were no general councils before the fourth century. The
   first six ecumenical councils gave no doctrinal decisions from which
   Protestants dissent. They, therefore, present no evidence of consent in
   those doctrines which are now peculiar to the Church of Rome.

   They appeal again to the writings of the fathers. But to this
   Protestants object, --

   First. That the writings of the apostolic fathers are too few to be
   taken as trustworthy representatives of the state of opinion in the
   Church for the first three hundred years. Ten or twenty writers
   scattered over such a period cannot reasonably be assumed to speak the
   mind of the whole Church.

   Secondly. The consent of these fathers, or of the half of them, cannot
   be adduced in favour of any doctrine in controversy between Protestants
   and Romanists.

   Thirdly. Almost unanimous consent can be quoted in support of doctrines
   which Romanists and Protestants unite in rejecting. The Jewish doctrine
   of the millennium passed over in its grossest form to the early
   Christian Church. But that doctrine the Church of Rome is specially
   zealous in denouncing.

   Fourthly. The consent of the fathers cannot be proved in support of
   doctrines which Protestants and Romanists agree in accepting. Not that
   these doctrines did not then enter into the faith of the Church, but
   simply that they were not presented.

   Fifthly. Such is the diversity of opinion among the fathers themselves,
   such the vagueness of their doctrinal statements, and such the
   unsettled usus loquendi as to important words, that the authority of
   the fathers may be quoted on either side of any disputed doctrine.
   There is no view, for example, of the nature of the Lord's supper,
   which has ever been held in the Church, for which the authority of some
   early father cannot be adduced. And often the same father presents one
   view at one time, and another at a different time.

   Sixthly. The writings of the fathers have been notoriously corrupted.
   It was a matter of great complaint in the early Church that spurious
   works were circulated; and that genuine works were recklessly
   interpolated. Some of the most important works of the Greek fathers are
   extant only in a Latin translation. This is the case with the greater
   part of the works of Iranæus, translated by Rufinus, whom Jerome
   charges with the most shameless adulteration.

   Another objection to the argument from consent is, that it is a
   Procrustean bed which may be extended or shortened at pleasure. In
   every Catena Patrum prepared to prove this consent in certain
   doctrines, it will be found that two or more writers in a century are
   cited as evincing the unanimous opinion of that century, while double
   or fourfold the number, of equally important writers, belonging to the
   same period, on the other side, are passed over in silence. There is no
   rule to guide in the application of this test, and no uniformity in the
   manner of its use.

   While, therefore, it is admitted that there has been a stream of
   doctrine flowing down uninterruptedly from the days of the Apostles, it
   is denied, as a matter of fact, that there has been any uninterrupted
   or general consent in any doctrine not clearly revealed in the Sacred
   Scriptures; and not even in reference to such clearly revealed
   doctrines, beyond the narrow limits of essential truths. And it is,
   moreover, denied that in any external, visible, organized Church, can
   the rule, quod semper, quod ab omnibus, be applied even to essential
   doctrines. The argument, therefore, of Romanists in favor of their
   peculiar doctrines, derived from general consent, is utterly untenable
   and fallacious. This is virtually admitted by the most zealous
   advocates of tradition. "Not only," says Professor Newman, [75] "is the
   Church Catholic bound to teach the truth, but she is divinely guided to
   teach it; her witness of the Christian faith is a matter of promise as
   well as of duty; her discernment of it is secured by a heavenly, as
   well as by a human rule. She is indefectible in it; and therefore has
   not only authority to enforce it, but is of authority to declaring it.
   The Church not only transmits the faith by human means, but has a
   supernatural gift for that purpose; that doctrine which is true,
   considered as an historical fact, is true also because she teaches it."
   The author of the Oxford Tract, No. 85, after saying, "We believe
   mainly because the Church of the fourth and fifth centuries unanimously
   believed," [76] adds, "Why should not the Church be divine? The burden
   of proof surely is on the other side. I will accept her doctrines, and
   her rites, and her Bible -- not one, and not the other, but all, --
   till I have clear proof that she is mistaken. It is I feel God's will
   that I should do so; and besides, I love these her possessions -- I
   love her Bible, her doctrines, and her rites; and therefore, I
   believe." [77] The Romanist then believes because the Church believes.
   This is the ultimate reason. The Church believes, not because she can
   historically prove that her doctrines have been received from the
   Apostles, but because she is supernaturally guided to know the truth.
   "Common consent," therefore, is practically abandoned, and tradition
   resolves itself into the present faith of the Church.

   Tradition not available by the People.

   4. Protestants object to tradition as part of the rule of faith,
   because it is not adapted to that purpose. A rule of faith to the
   people must be something which they can apply; a standard by which they
   can judge. But this unwritten revelation is not contained in any one
   volume accessible to the people, and intelligible by them. It is
   scattered through the ecclesiastical records of eighteen centuries. It
   is absolutely impossible for the people to learn what it teaches. How
   can they tell whether the Church in all ages has taught the doctrine of
   transubstantiation, the sacrifice of the Mass, or any other popish
   doctrine. They must take all such doctrines upon trust, i.e., on the
   faith of the extant Church. But this is to deny that to them tradition
   is a rule of faith. They are required to believe, on the peril of their
   souls, doctrines, the pretended evidence of which it is impossible for
   them to ascertain or appreciate.

   5. Romanists argue that such is the obscurity of the Scriptures, that
   not only the people, but the Church itself needs the aid of tradition
   in order to their being properly understood. But if the Bible, a
   comparatively plain book, in one portable volume, needs to be thus
   explained, What is to explain the hundreds of folios in which these
   traditions are recorded? Surely a guide to the interpretation of the
   latter must be far more needed than one for the Scriptures.

   Tradition destroys the Authority of the Scriptures.

   6. Making tradition a part of the rule of faith subverts the authority
   of the Scriptures. This follows as a natural and unavoidable
   consequence. If there be two standards of doctrine of equal authority,
   the one the explanatory, and infallible interpreter of the other, it is
   of necessity the interpretation which determines the faith of the
   people. Instead, therefore, of our faith resting on the testimony of
   God as recorded in his Word, it rests on what poor, fallible, often
   fanciful, prejudiced, benighted men, tell us is the meaning of that
   word. Man and his authority take the place of God. As this is the
   logical consequence of making tradition a rule of faith, so it is an
   historical fact that the Scriptures have been made of no account
   wherever the authority of tradition has been admitted. Our Lord said,
   that the Scribes and Pharisees made the word of God of no effect by
   their traditions; that they taught for doctrines the commandments of
   men. This is no less historically true of the Church of Rome. A great
   mass of doctrines, rites, ordinances, and institutions, of which the
   Scriptures know nothing, has been imposed on the reason, conscience,
   and life of the people. The Roman Catholic religion of our day, with
   its hierarchy, ritual, image and saint worship; with its absolutions,
   indulgences, and its despotic power over the conscience and the life of
   the individual, is as little like the religion of the New Testament, as
   the present religion of the Hindus with its myriad of deities, its
   cruelties, and abominations, is like the simple religion of their
   ancient Vedas. In both cases similar causes have produced similar
   effects. In both there has been a provision for giving divine authority
   to the rapidly accumulating errors and corruptions of succeeding ages.

   7. Tradition teaches error, and therefore cannot be divinely controlled
   so as to be a rule of faith. The issue is between Scripture and
   tradition. Both cannot be true. The one contradicts the other. One or
   the other must be given up. Of this it least no true Protestant has any
   doubt. All the doctrines peculiar to Romanism, and for which Romanists
   plead the authority of Scripture, Protestants believe to be
   anti-scriptural; and therefore they need no other evidence to prove
   that tradition is not to be trusted either in matters of faith or
   practice.

   The Scriptures not received on the Authority of Tradition.

   8. Romanists argue that Protestants concede the authority of tradition,
   because it is on that authority they receive the New Testament as the
   word of God. This is not correct. We do not believe the New Testament
   to be divine on the ground of the testimony of the Church. We receive
   the books included in the canonical Scriptures on the twofold ground of
   internal and external evidence. It can be historically proved that
   those books were written by the men whose names they bear; and it can
   also be proved that those men were the duly authenticated organs of the
   Holy Ghost. The historical evidence which determines the authorship of
   the New Testament is not exclusively that of the Christian fathers. The
   testimony of heathen writers is, in some respects, of greater weight
   than that of the fathers themselves. We may believe on the testimony of
   English history, ecclesiastical and secular, that the Thirty-Nine
   Articles were framed by the English Reformers, without being
   traditionists. In like manner we may believe that the books of the New
   Testament were written by the men whose names they bear without
   admitting tradition to be a part of the rule of faith.

   Besides, external evidence of any kind is a very subordinate part of
   the ground of a Protestant's faith in the Scripture. That ground is
   principally the nature of the doctrines therein revealed, and the
   witness of the Spirit, with and by the truth, to the heart and
   conscience. We believe the Scriptures for much the same reason that we
   believe the Decalogue.

   The Church is bound to stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has
   made it free, and not to be again entangled with the yoke of bondage,
   -- a bondage not only to human doctrines and institutions, but to
   soul-destroying errors and superstitions.

   § 7. Office of the Church as a Teacher.

   A. The Romish Doctrine on this subject.

   Romanists teach that the Church, as an external, visible society,
   consisting of those who profess the Christian religion, united in
   communion of the same sacraments and subjection to lawful pastors, and
   especially to the Pope of Rome, is divinely appointed to be the
   infallible teacher of men in all things pertaining to faith and
   practice. It is qualified for this office by the plenary revelation of
   the truth in the written and unwritten word of God, and by the
   supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit vouchsafed to the bishops as
   official successors of the Apostles, or, to the Pope as the successor
   of Peter in his supremacy over the whole Church, and as vicar of Christ
   on earth.

   There is something simple and grand in this theory. It is wonderfully
   adapted to the tastes and wants of men. It relieves them of personal
   responsibility. Everything is decided for them. Their salvation is
   secured by merely submitting to be saved by an infallible,
   sin-pardoning, and grace-imparting Church. Many may be inclined to
   think that it would have been a great blessing had Christ left on earth
   a visible representative of himself clothed with his authority to teach
   and govern, and an order of men dispersed through the world endowed
   with the gifts of the original Apostles, -- men everywhere accessible,
   to whom we could resort in all times of difficulty and doubt, and whose
   decisions could be safely received as the decisions of Christ himself.
   God's thoughts, however, are not as our thoughts. We know that when
   Christ was on earth, men did not believe or obey Him. We know that when
   the Apostles were still living, and their authority was still confirmed
   by signs, and wonders, and divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost,
   the Church was nevertheless distracted by heresies and schisms. If any
   in their sluggishness are disposed to think that a perpetual body of
   infallible teachers would be a blessing, all must admit that the
   assumption of infallibility by the ignorant, the erring, and the wicked
   must be an evil inconceivably great. The Romish theory if true might be
   a blessing; if false it must be an awful curse. That it is false may be
   demonstrated to the satisfaction of all who do not wish it to be true,
   and who, unlike the Oxford Tractarian, are not determined to believe it
   because they love it.

   B. The Romish definition of the Church is derived from what the Church
   of Rome now is.

   Before presenting a brief outline of the argument against this theory,
   it may be well to remark that the Romish definition of the Church is
   purely empirical. It is not derived from the signification or usage of
   the word ekklesia in the New Testament; nor from what is there taught
   concerning the Church. It is merely a statement of what the Church of
   Rome now is. It is a body professing the same faith, united in the
   communion of the same sacraments, subject to pastors (i.e., bishops)
   assumed to be lawful, and to the Pope as the vicar of Christ. Now in
   this definition it is gratuitously assumed, --

   1. That the Church to which the promise of divine guidance is given, is
   an external, visible organization; and not the people of God as such in
   their personal and individual relation to Christ. In other words, it is
   assumed that the Church is a visible society, and not a collective term
   for the people of God; as when it is said of Paul that he persecuted
   the Church; and of Christ that He loved the Church and gave himself for
   it. Christ certainly did not die for any external, visible, organized
   Society.

   2. The Romish theory assumes, not only that the Church is an external
   organization, but that it must be organized in one definite, prescribed
   form. But this assumption is not only unreasonable, it is unscriptural,
   because no one form is prescribed in Scripture as essential to the
   being of the Church; and because it is contrary to the whole spirit and
   character of the gospel, that forms of government should be necessary
   to the spiritual life and salvation of men. Moreover, this assumption
   is inconsistent with historical facts. The Church in all its parts has
   never been organized according to one plan.

   3. But conceding that the Church is an external society, and that it
   must be organized according to one plan, it is a gratuitous and
   untenable presumption, that that plan must be the episcopal. It is a
   notorious fact that diocesan episcopacy did not exist during the
   apostolic age. It is equally notorious that that plan of government was
   gradually introduced. And it is no less notorious that a large part of
   the Church in which Christ dwells by his presence, and which He in
   every way acknowledges and honours, has no bishops until the present
   day. The government of the Church by bishops, Romanists admit is one of
   the institutions which rest not on Scripture, but on tradition for
   their authority.

   4. But should everything else be conceded, the assumption that
   subjection to the Pope, as the vicar of Christ, is necessary to the
   existence of the Church, is utterly unreasonable. This is the climax.
   There is not the slightest evidence in the New Testament or in the
   apostolic age, that Peter had any such primacy among the Apostles as
   Romanists claim. There is not only the absence of all evidence that he
   exercised any jurisdiction over them, but there is abundant evidence to
   the contrary. This is clear from Peter, James, and John, being
   mentioned together as those who appeared to be pillars (Gal. ii. 9),
   and this distinction was due not to office, but to character. It is
   moreover clear from the full equality in gifts and authority which Paul
   asserted for himself, and proved to the satisfaction of the whole
   Church that he possessed. It is clear from the subordinate position
   occupied by Peter in the Council of Jerusalem (Acts xv.), and from the
   severe reproof he received from Paul at Antioch (Gal. ii. 11-21). It is
   a plain historical fact, that Paul and John were the master-spirits of
   the Apostolic Church. But admitting the primacy of Peter in the college
   of Apostles, there is no evidence that such primacy was intended to be
   perpetual. There is no command to elect a successor to him in that
   office; no rules given as to the mode of such election, or the persons
   by whom the choice was to be made; and no record of such election
   having actually been made. Everything is made out of the air. But
   admitting that Peter was constituted the head of the whole Church on
   earth, and that such headship was intended to be continued, what
   evidence is there that the Bishop of Rome was to all time entitled to
   that office? It is very doubtful whether Peter ever was in Rome. The
   sphere of his labors was in Palestine and the East. It is certain he
   never was Bishop of the Church in that city. And even if he were, he
   was Primate, not as Bishop of Rome, but by appointment of Christ.
   According to the theory, he was Primate before he went to Rome, and not
   because he went there The simple historical fact is, that as Rome was
   the seat of the Roman empire, the Bishop of Rome aspired to be the head
   of the Church, which claim after a long struggle came to be
   acknowledged, at least in the West.

   It is on the four gratuitous and unreasonable assumptions above
   mentioned, namely, that the Church to which the promise of the Spirit
   was made is an external, visible organization; that a particular mode
   of organization is essential to its existence; that that mode is the
   episcopal; and that it must be papal, i.e., the whole episcopacy be
   subject to the Bishop of Rome; -- it is on these untenable assumptions
   that the whole stupendous system of Romanism rests. If any one of them
   fail, the whole falls to the ground. These assumptions are so entirely
   destitute of any adequate historical proof, that no reasonable man can
   accept them on their own evidence. It is only those who have been
   taught or induced to believe the extant Church to be infallible, who
   can believe them. And they believe not because these points can be
   proved, but on the assertion of the Church. The Romish Church says that
   Christ constituted the Church on the papal system, and thererore, it is
   to be believed. The thing to be proved is taken for granted. It is a
   petitio principii from beginning to end.

   C. The Romish Doctrine of Infallibility founded on a Wrong Theory of
   the Church.

   The first great argument of Protestants against Romanism concerns the
   theory of the Church.

   God entered into a covenant with Abraham. In that covenant there were
   certain promises which concerned his natural descendants through Isaac,
   which promises were suspended on the national obedience of the people.
   That covenant, however, contained the promise of redemption through
   Christ. He was the seed in whom all the nations of the earth were to be
   blessed. The Jews came to believe that this promise of redemption,
   i.e., of the blessings of the Messiah's reign, was made to them as a
   nation; and that it was conditioned on membership in that nation. All
   who were Jews either by descent or proselytism, and who were
   circumcised, and adhered to the Law, were saved. All others would
   certainly perish forever. This is the doctrine which our Lord so
   pointedly condemned, and against which St. Paul so strenuously argued.
   When the Jews claimed that they were the children of God, because they
   were the children of Abraham, Christ told them that they might be the
   children of Abraham, and yet the children of the devil (John viii.
   33-44); as John, his forerunner, had before said, say not "We have
   Abraham to our father; for I say unto you, that God is able of these
   stones to raise up children unto Abraham." (Matt. iii. 9) It is against
   this doctrine the epistles to the Romans and Galatians are principally
   directed. The Apostle shows, (1.) That the promise of salvation was not
   confined to the Jews, or to the members of any external organization.
   (2.) And therefore that it was not conditioned on descent from Abraham,
   nor on circumcision, nor on adherence to the Old Testament theocracy.
   (3 ) That all believers (hoi ek pisteos) are the sons and, therefore,
   the heirs of Abraham. (Gal. iii. 7.) (4.) That a man might be a Jew, a
   Hebrew of the Hebrews, circumcised on the eighth day, and touching the
   righteousness which is of the law blameless, and yet it avail him
   nothing. (Phil. iii. 4-6.) (5.) Because he is not a Jew who is one
   outwardly; and circumcision is of the heart. (Romans ii. 28-29.) (6.)
   And consequently that God could cast off the Jews as a nations without
   acting inconsistently with his covenant with Abraham, because the
   promise was not made to the Israel kata sarka, but to the Israel kata
   pneuma. (Rom. ix. 6-8.)

   Romanists have transferred the whole Jewish theory to the Christian
   Church; while Protestants adhere to the doctrine of Christ and his
   Apostles. Romanists teach, (1.) That the Church is essentially an
   external, organized community, as the commonwealth of Israel. (2.) That
   to this external society, all the attributes, prerogatives, and
   promises of the true Church belong. (3.) That membership in that
   society is the indispensable condition of salvation; as it is only by
   union with the Church that men are united to Christ, and, through its
   ministrations, become partakers of his redemption. (4.) That all who
   die in communion with this external society, although they may, if not
   perfect at death, suffer for a longer or shorter period in purgatory,
   shall ultimately be saved (5.) All outside of this external
   organization perish eternally. There is, therefore, not a single
   element of the Jewish theory which is not reproduced in the Romish.

   Protestant Doctrine of the Nature of the Church.

   Protestants, on the other hand, teach on this subject, in exact
   accordance with the doctrine of Christ and the Apostles: (1.) That the
   Church as such, or in its essential nature, is not an external
   organization. (2.) All true believers, in whom the Spirit of God
   dwells, are members of that Church which is the body of Christ, no
   matter with what ecclesiastical organization they may be connected, and
   even although they have no such connection. The thief on the cross was
   saved, though he was not a member of any external Church. (3.)
   Therefore, that the attributes, prerogatives, and promises of the
   Church do not belong to any external society as such, but to the true
   people of God collectively considered; and to external societies only
   so far as they consist of true believers, and are controlled by them.
   This is only saying what every man admits to be true, that the
   attributes, prerogatives, and promises pertaining to Christians belong
   exclusively to true Christians, and not to wicked or worldly men who
   call themselves Christians. (4.) That the condition of membership in
   the true Church is not union with any organized society, but faith in
   Jesus Christ. They are the children of God by faith; they are the sons
   of Abraham, heirs of the promise of redemption made to him by faith;
   whether they be Jews or Gentiles, bond or free; whether Protestants or
   Romanists, Presbyterians or Episcopalians; or whether they be so widely
   scattered, that no two or three of them are able to meet together for
   worship.

   Protestants do not deny that there is a visible Church Catholic on
   earth, consisting of all those who profess the true religion, together
   with their children. But they are not all included in any one external
   society. They also admit that it is the duty of Christians to unite for
   the purpose of worship and mutual watch and care. They admit that to
   such associations and societies certain prerogatives and promises
   belong; that they have, or ought to have the officers whose
   qualifications and duties are prescribed in the Scriptures; that there
   always have been, and probably always will be, such Christian
   organizations, or visible churches. But they deny that any one of these
   societies, or all of them collectively, constitute the Church for which
   Christ died; in which He dwells by his Spirit; to which He has promised
   perpetuity, catholicity, unity, and divine guidance into the knowledge
   of the truth. Any one of them, or all of them, one after another, may
   apostatize from the faith, and all the promises of God to his Church be
   fulfilled. The Church did not fail, when God reserved to himself only
   seven thousand in all Israel who had not bowed the knee unto Baal.

   Almost all the points of difference between Protestants and Romanists
   depend on the decision of the question, "What is the Church?" If their
   theory be correct; if the Church is the external society of professing
   Christians, subject to apostle-bishops (i.e., to bishops who are
   apostles), and to the Pope as Christ's vicar on earth; then we are
   bound to submit to it; and then too beyond the pale of that communion
   there is no salvation. But if every true believer is, in virtue of his
   faith, a member of that Church to which Christ promises guidance and
   salvation, then Romanism falls to the ground.

   The Opposing Theories of the Church.

   That the two opposing theories of the Church, the Romish and
   Protestant, are what has been stated above is so generally known and so
   unquestioned, that it is unnecessary to cite authorities on either
   side. It is enough, so far as the doctrine of Romanists is concerned,
   to quote the language of Bellarmin, [78] that the marks of the Church
   are three: "Professio veræ fidei, sacramentorum communio, et subjectio
   ad legitimum pastorem, Romanum Pontificem. -- Atque hoc interest inter
   sententiam nostram et alias omnes, quod omnes aliæ requirunt internas
   virtutes ad constituendum aliquem in Ecclesia, et propterea Ecclesiam
   veram invisibilem faciunt; nos autem credimus in Ecclesia inveniri
   omnes virtutes, -- tamen ut aliquis aliquo modo dici possit pars veræ
   Ecclesiæ, -- non putamus requiri ullam internam virtutem, sed tantum
   externam professionem fidei, et sacramentorum communionem, quæ sensu
   ipso percipitur. Ecclesia enim est coetus hominum ita visibilis et
   palpabilis, ut est coetus Populi Romani, vel regnum Galliæ aut
   respublica Venetorum." The Lutheran Symbols define the Church as,
   "Congregatio sanctorum." [79] "Congregatio sanctorum et vere
   credentium." [80] "Societas fidei et Spiritus Sancti in cordibus." [81]
   "Congregatio sanctorum, qui habent inter se societatem ejusdem
   evangelii seu doctrinæ, et ejusdem Spiritus Sancti, qui corda eorum
   renovat, sanctificat et gubernat;" and [82] "Populus spiritualis, non
   civilibus ritibus distinctus a gentibus, sed verus populus Dei renatus
   per Spiritum Sanctum." [83]

   The Symbols of the Reformed Churches present the same doctrine. [84]
   The Confessio Helvetica says, "Oportet semper fuisse, nunc esse et ad
   finem usque seculi futuram esse Ecclesiam, i.e., e mundo evocatum vel
   collectum coetum fidelium, sanctorum inquam omnium communionem, eorum
   videlicet, qui Deum verum in Christo servatore per verbum et Spiritum
   Sanctum vere cognoscunt et rite colunt, denique omnibus bonis per
   Christum gratuito oblatis fide participant." [85] Confessio Gallicana:
   "Affirmamus ex Dei verbo, Ecclesiam esse fidelium coetum, qui in verbo
   Dei sequendo et pura religione colenda consentiunt, in qua etiam
   quotidie proficiunt." [86] Confessio Belgica: "Credimus et confitemur
   unicam Ecclesiam catholicam seu universalem, quæ est sancta congregatio
   seu coetus omnium fidelium Christianorum, qui totam suam salutem ab uno
   Jesu Christo exspectant, abluti ipsius sanguine et per Spiritum ejus
   sanctificati atque obsignati. Hæc Ecclesia sancta nullo est aut certo
   loco sita et circumscripta, aut ullis certis personis astricta aut
   alligata: sed per omnem orbem terrarum sparsa atque diffusa est." [87]
   The same doctrine is found in the answer to the fifty-fourth question
   in the Heidelberg Catechism. In the Geneva Catechism to the question,
   "Quid est Ecclesia?" the answer is, "Corpus ac societas fidelium, quos
   Deus ad vitam æternam prædestinavit." [88]

   Winer in his "Comparative Darstellung," [89] thus briefly states the
   two theories concerning the Church. Romanists, he says, "define the
   Church on earth, as the community of those baptized in the name of
   Christ, united under his Vicar, the Pope, its visible head.
   Protestants, on the other hand, as the communion of saints, that is, of
   those who truly believe on Christ, in which the gospel is purely
   preached and the sacraments properly administered."

   Proof of the Protestant Doctrine of the Church.

   This is not the place to enter upon a formal vindication of the
   Protestant doctrine of the nature of the Church. That belongs to the
   department of ecclesiology. What follows may suffice for the present
   purpose.

   The question is not whether the word Church is not properly used, and
   in accordance with the Scriptures, for visible, organized bodies of
   professing Christians, or for all such Christians collectively
   considered. Nor is it the question, whether we are to regard as
   Christians those who, being free from scandal, profess their faith in
   Christ, or societies of such professors organized for the worship of
   Christ and the administration of his discipline, as being true
   churches. But the question is, whether the Church to which the
   attributes, prerogatives, and promises pertaining to the body of Christ
   belong, is in its nature a visible, organized community; and specially,
   whether it is a community organized in some one exclusive form, and
   most specially on the papal form; or, whether it is a spiritual body
   consisting of true believers. Whether when the Bible addresses a body
   of men as "the called of Jesus Christ," "beloved of God," "partakers of
   the heavenly calling:" as "the children of God, joint heirs with Christ
   of a heavenly inheritance;" as "elect according to the foreknowledge of
   God the Father, through sanctification and sprinkling of the blood of
   Christ;" as "partakers of the like precious faith with the Apostles;"
   as "those who are washed, and sanctified, and justified in the name of
   the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God;" as those who being dead
   in sin, had been "quickened and raised up and made to sit together in
   heavenly places with Christ Jesus;" it means the members of an external
   society as such, and because such, or, the true people of God? The
   question is, whether when to the men thus designated and described,
   Christ promised to be with them to the end of the world, to give them
   his Spirit, to guide them unto the knowledge of the truth, to keep them
   through the power of the Spirit, so that the gates of hell should not
   prevail against them -- he means his sincere or his nominal disciples,
   -- believers or unbelievers? These questions admit of but one answer.
   The attributes ascribed to the Church in Scripture belong to true
   believers alone. The promises made to the Church are fulfilled only to
   believers. The relation in which the Church stands to God and Christ is
   sustained alone by true believers. They only are the children and heirs
   of God; they only are the body of Christ in which He dwells by his
   Spirit; they only are the temple of God, the bride of Christ, the
   partakers of his glory. The doctrine that a man becomes a child of God
   and an heir of eternal life by membership in any external society,
   overturns the very foundations of the gospel, and introduces a new
   method of salvation. Yet this is the doctrine on which the whole system
   of Romanism rests. As, therefore, the Apostle shows that the promises
   made to Israel under the Old Testament, the promise of perpetuity, of
   extension over the whole earth, of the favour and fellowship of God,
   and all the blessings of the Messiah's reign, were not made to the
   external Israel as such, but to the true people of God; so Protestants
   contend that the promises made to the Church as the body and bride of
   Christ are not made to the external body of professed Christians, but
   to those who truly believe on him and obey his gospel.

   The absurdities which flow from the substitution of the visible Church
   for the invisible, from transferring the attributes, prerogatives, and
   promises which belong to true believers, to an organized body of
   nominal or professed believers, are so great that Romanists cannot be
   consistent. They cannot adhere to their own theory. They are forced to
   admit that the wicked are not really members of the Church. They are
   "in it" but not "of it." Their connection with it is merely external,
   as that of the chaff with the wheat. This, however, is the Protestant
   doctrine. The Romish doctrine is precisely the reverse. Romanists teach
   that the chaff is the wheat; that the chaff becomes wheat by external
   connection with the precious grain. Just so certain, therefore, as that
   chaff is not wheat; that nominal Christians, as such, are not true
   Christians; just so certain is it that no external society consisting
   of good and bad, is that Church to which the promise of Christ's
   presence and salvation is made. It is as Turrettin says, [90] "proton
   pseudos pontificiorum in tota controversia est, ecclesiam metiri velle
   ex societatis civilis modulo, ut ejus essentia in externis tantum et in
   sensus incurrentibus consistat, et sola professio fidei sufficiat ad
   membrum ecclesiæ constituendum, nec ipsa fides et pietas interna ad id
   necessario requirantur."

   D. The Doctrine of Infallibility founded on the False Assumption of the
   Perpetuity of the Apostleship.

   As the first argument against the doctrine of Romanists as to the
   infallibility of the Church is, that it makes the Church of Rome to be
   the body to which the attributes, prerogatives, and promises of Christ
   to true believers belong; the second is that it limits the of the
   teaching of the Spirit, to the bishops as successors of the Apostles.
   In other words, Romanists falsely assume the perpetuity of the
   apostleship. If it be true that the prelates of Church of Rome, or of
   any other church, are apostles, invested the same authority to teach
   and to rule as the original messengers of Christ, then we must be bound
   to yield the same faith to their teaching, and the same obedience to
   their commands, as are due to the inspired writings of the New
   Testament. And such is the doctrine of the Church of Rome.

   Modern Prelates are not Apostles.

   To determine whether modern bishops are apostles, it is necessary in
   the first place to determine thee nature of the Apostleship, and
   ascertain whether modern prelates have the gifts, qualifications,
   credentials of the office. Who then were the Apostles? They were a
   definite number of men selected by Christ to be his witnesses, to
   testify to his doctrines, to the facts of his life, to his death, and
   specially to his resurrection. To qualify them for this office of
   authoritative witnesses, it was necessary, (1.) That they should have
   independent and plenary knowledge of the gospel. (2.) That they should
   have seen Christ after his resurrection. (3.) That they should be
   inspired, i.e., that they should be individually and severally so
   guided by the Spirit as to be infallible in all their instructions.
   (4.) That they should be authenticated as the messengers of Christ, by
   adherence to the true gospel, by success in preaching (Paul said to the
   Corinthians that they were the seal of his apostleship, 1 Cor. ix. 2);
   and by signs and wonders and divers miracles and gifts of the Holy
   Ghost. Such were the gifts and qualifications and credentials of the
   original Apostles; and those who claimed the office without possessirig
   these gifts and credentials, were pronounced false apostles and
   messengers of Satan.

   When Paul claimed to be an apostle, he felt it necessary to prove, (1.)
   That he had been appointed not by man nor through men, immediately by
   Jesus Christ. (Gal. i. 1.) (2.) That he had not been taught the gospel
   by others, but received his knowledge by immediate revelation. (Gal. i.
   12.) (3.) That he had see Christ after his resurrection. (1 Cor. ix. 1
   and xv. 8.) (4.) That he was inspired, or infallible as a teacher, so
   that men were bound to recognize his teachings as the teaching of
   Christ (1 Cor. xiv. 37.) (5.) That the Lord had authenticated his
   apostolic mission as fully as he had done that of Peter. (Gal. ii. 8.)
   (6.) "The sins of an apostle," he tells the Corinthians, "were wrought
   among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds." (2
   Cor. xii. 12.)

   Modern prelates do not claim to possess any one of these gifts. Nor do
   they pretend to the credentials which authenticated the mission of the
   Apostles of Christ. They claim no immediate commission; no independent
   knowledge derived from immediate revelation; no personal infallibility;
   no vision of Christ; and no gift of miracles. That is, they claim the
   authority of the office, but not its reality. It is very plain,
   therefore, that they are not apostles. They cannot have the authority
   of the office without having the gifts on which that authority was
   founded, and from which it emanated. If a man cannot be a prophet
   without the gift of prophecy; or a miracle-worker without the gift of
   miracles; or have the gift of tongues without the ability to speak
   other languages than his own; no man can rightfully claim to be an
   apostle without possessing the gifts which made the original Apostles
   what they were. The deaf and dumb might as reasonably claim to have the
   gift of tongues. The world has never seen or suffered a greater
   imposture than that weak, ignorant, and often immoral men, should claim
   the same authority to teach and rule that belonged to men to whom the
   truth was supernaturally revealed, who were confessedly infallible in
   its communication, and to whose divine mission God himself bore witness
   in signs and wonders, and divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost.
   The office of the Apostles as described in the New Testament, was,
   therefore, from its nature incapable of being transmitted, and has not
   in fact been perpetuated.

   There is no command given in the New Testament to keep up the
   succession of the Apostles. When Judas had apostatized, Peter said his
   place must be filled, but the selection was to be confined to those, as
   he said, "which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus
   went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John unto that
   same day that He was taken up from us." (Acts i. 21, 22.) The reason
   assigned for this appointment was not that the Apostleship might be
   continued, but that the man selected might be "a witness with us of his
   resurrection." "And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon
   Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven Apostles." And that was
   the end. We never hear of Matthias afterward. It is very doubtful
   whether this appointment of Matthias had any validity. What is here
   recorded (Acts, i. 15-26), took place before the Apostles had been
   endued with power from on high (Acts i. 8), and, therefore, before they
   had any authority to act in the premises. Christ in his own time and
   way completed the number of his witnesses by calling Paul to be an
   Apostle. But, however this may be, here if ever exceptio probat
   regulam. It proves that the ranks of the Apostles could be filled, and
   the succession continued only from the number of those who could bear
   independent witness of the resurrection and doctrines of Christ.

   Besides the fact that there is no command to appoint apostles, there is
   clear evidence that the office was not designed to be perpetuated. With
   regard to all the permanent officers of the Church, there is, (1.) Not
   only a promise to continue the gifts which pertained to the office, and
   the command to appoint suitable persons to fill it, but also a
   specification of the qualifications to be sought and demanded; and (2.)
   a record of the actual appointment of incumbents; and (3.) historical
   evidence of their continuance in the Church from that day to this. With
   regard to the Apostleship, all this is wanting. As we have seen, the
   gifts of the office have not been continued, there is no command to
   perpetuate the office, no directions to guide the Church in the
   selection of proper persons to be apostles, no record of their
   appointment, and no historical evidence of their continuance; on the
   contrary, they disappear entirely after the death of the original
   twelve. It might as well be asserted that the Pharaohs of Egypt, or the
   twelve Cæsars of Rome have been continued, as that the race of apostles
   has been perpetuated.

   It is true that there are a few passages in which persons other than
   the original twelve seem to be designated as apostles. But from the
   beginning of the Church until of late, no one has ventured on that
   account to regard Barnabas, Silas, Timothy, and Titus, as apostles, in
   the official sense of the word. All the designations given to the
   officers of the Church in the New Testament, are used in different
   senses. Thus, "presbyter" or "elder," means, an old man, a Jewish
   officer, an officer of the Church. The word "deacon," means, a
   domestic, sometimes a secular officer, sometimes any minister of the
   Church; sometimes the lowest order of church officers. Because Paul and
   Peter call themselves "deacons," it does not prove that their office
   was to serve tables. In like manner the word "apostle" is sometimes
   used in its etymological sense "a messenger," sometimes in a religious
   sense, as we use the word "missionary;" and sometimes in its strict
   official sense, in which it is confined to the immediate messengers of
   Christ. Nothing can be plainer from the New Testament than that neither
   Silas nor Timothy, nor any other person, is ever spoken of as the
   official equal of the twelve Apostles. These constitute a class by
   themselves. They stand out the New Testament as they do in all Church
   history, as the authoritative founders of the Christian Church, without
   peers or colleagues.

   If, then, the Apostleship, from its nature and design, was incapable of
   transmission; if there be this decisive evidence from Scripture and
   history, that it has not been perpetuated, then the whole theory of the
   Romanists concerning the Church falls to the ground. That theory is
   founded on the assumption that prelates are apostles, invested with the
   same authority to teach and rule, as the original messengers of Christ.
   If this assumption is unfounded, then all claim to the infallibility of
   the Church must be given up; for it is not pretended that the mass of
   the people is infallible nor the priesthood, but simply the episcopate.
   And bishops are infallible only on the assumption that they are
   apostles, in the official sense of the term. This they certainly are
   not. The Church may make priests, and bishops, and even popes; but
   Christ alone can make an Apostle. For an Apostle was a man endowed with
   supernatural knowledge, and with supernatural power.

   E. Infallibility founded on a False Interpretation of the Promise of
   Christ.

   The third decisive argument against the infallibility of the Church is,
   that Christ never promised to preserve it from all error. What is here
   meant is that Christ never promised the true Church, that is, "the
   company of true believers," that they should not err in doctrine. He
   did promise that they should not fatally apostatize From the truth. He
   did promise that He would, grant his true disciples such a measure of
   divine guidance by his Spirit, that they should know enough to be
   saved. He, moreover, promised that He would call men into the ministry,
   and give them the qualifications of faithful teachers, such as were the
   presbyters whom the Apostles ordained in every city. But there is no
   promise of infallibility either to the Church as a whole, or to any
   class of men in the Church. Christ promised to sanctify his people; but
   this was not a promise to make them perfectly holy in this life. He
   promised to give them joy and peace in believing; but this is not a
   promise to make them perfectly happy in this life, -- that they should
   have no trials or sorrows. Then, why should the promise to teach be a
   promise to render infallible. As the Church has gone through the world
   bathed in tears and blood, so has she gone soiled with sin and error.
   It is just as manifest that she has never been infallible, as that she
   has never been penfectly holy. Christ no more promised the one than the
   other.

   F. The Doctrine contradicted by Facts.

   The fourth argument is that the Romish doctrine of the infallibility of
   the Church is contradicted by undeniable historical facts. It therefore
   cannot be true. The Church has often erred, and therefore it is not
   infallible.

   Protestants believe that the Church, under all dispensations, has been
   the same. It has always had the same God; the same Redeemer; the same
   rule of faith and practice (the written Word of God, at least from the
   time of Moses), the same promise of the presence and guidance of the
   Spirit, the same pledge of perpetuity and triumph. To them, therefore,
   the fact that the whole visible Church repeatedly apostatized during
   the old economy -- and that, not the people only, but all the
   representatives of the Church, the priests, the Levites, and the elders
   -- is a decisive proof that the external, visible Church may fatally
   err in matters of faith. No less decisive is the fact that the whole
   Jewish Church and people, as a church and nation, rejected Christ. He
   came to his own, and his own received him not. The vast majority of the
   people, the chief priests, the scribes and the elders, refused to
   recognize him as the Messiah. The Sanhedrim, the great representative
   body of the Church at that time, pronounced him worthy of death, and
   demanded his crucifixion. This, to Protestants, is overwhelming proof
   that the Church may err.

   Romanists, however, make such a difference between the Church before
   and after the advent of Christ, that they do not admit the Force of
   this argument. That the Jewish Church erred, they say, is no proof that
   the Christian Church can err. It will be necessary, therefore, to show
   that according to the principles and admissions of Romanists
   themselves, the Church has erred. It taught at one time what it
   condemned at another, and what the Church of Rome now condemns. To
   prove this, it will suffice to refer to two undeniable examples.

   It is to be borne in mind that by the Church, in this connection,
   Romanists do not mean the true people of God; nor the body of
   professing Christians; nor the majority of priests, or doctors of
   divinity, but the episcopate. What the body of bishops of any age
   teach, all Christians are bound to believe, because these bishops are
   so guided by the Spirit as to be infallible in their teaching.

   The Arian Apostasy.

   The first great historical fact inconsistent with this theory is, that
   the great majority of the bishops, both of the Eastern and Western
   Church, including the Pope of Rome, taught Arianism, which the whole
   Church, both before and afterwards, condemned. The decision of three
   hundred and eighty bishops at the Council of Nice, satisfied by the
   assent of the great majority of those who did not attend that Council,
   is fairly taken as proof that the visible Church at that time taught,
   as Rome now teaches, that the Son is consubstantial within time Father.
   The fact that some dissented at the time, or that more soon joined in
   that dissent; or, that in a few years in the East, the dissentients
   were in the majority, is not considered as invalidating the decision of
   that Council as the decision of the Church; because a majority of the
   bishops, as a body, were still in favor of the Nicene doctrine. Then,
   by parity of reasoning, the decisions of the two contemporary councils,
   one at Seleucia in the East, the other at Ariminum in the West,
   including nearly eight hundred bishops, ratified as those decisions
   were by the great majority of the bishops of the whole Church
   (including Liberius, the bishop of Rome), must be accepted as the
   teaching of the visible Church of that age. But those decisions,
   according to the previous and subsequent judgment of the Church, were
   heretical. It has been urged that the language adopted by the Council
   of Arminum admits of an orthodox interpretation. In answer to this, it
   is enough to say, (1.) That it was drawn up, proposed, and urged by the
   avowed opponents of the Nicene Creed. (2.) That it was strenuously
   resisted by the advocates of that creed, and renounced as soon as they
   gained the ascendency. (3.) That Mr. Palmer himself admits that the
   Council repudiated the word "consubstantial" as expressing the relation
   of the Son to the Father. But this was the precise point in dispute
   between the Orthodox and semi-Arians.

   Ancients and moderns unite in testifying to the general prevalence of
   Arianism at that time. Gregory Nazianzen says, [91] "Nam si perpaucos
   exceperis, . . . . omnes (pastores) tempori obsecuti sunt: hoc tantum
   inter eos discriminis fuit, quod alii citius, alii seriùs in eam
   fraudem inciderunt, atque, alii impietatis duces antistitesque se
   præbuerunt." Jerome says: "Ingemuit totus orbis terrarum, et Arianum se
   esse miratus est." [92] He also says: [93] "Ecclesia non parietibus
   consistit, sed in dogmatum veritate, Ecclesia ibi est ubi fides vera
   est. Ceterum ante annos quindecim aut viginti parietes omnes hic
   ecclesiarum hæretici (Ariani) possidebant, Ecclesia autem vera illic
   erat, ubi vera fides erat." It is here asserted that the whole world
   had become Arian; and that all the churches were in the possession of
   heretics. These statements must be taken with due allowance. They
   nevertheless prove that the great majority of the bishops had adopted
   the Arian, or semi-Arian Creed. To the same effect Athanasius says:
   "Quæ nunc ecclesia libere Christum adorat? Si quidem ea, si pia est,
   periculo subjacet? . . . . Nam si alicubi pii et Christi studiosi (sunt
   autem ubique tales permulti) illi itidem, ut Prophetæ et magnus ille
   Elias, absconduntur, . . . . et in speluncas et cavernas terræ sese
   abstrudunt, aut in solitudine aberrantes commorantur." [94] Vincent of
   Lerins [95] says: "Arianorum venenum non jam portiunculam quamdam, sed
   pene orbem totum contaminaverat, adeo ut prope cunctis Latini sermonis
   episcopis partim vi partim fraude deceptis caligo quædam mentibus
   effunderetur." To these ancient testimonies any number of authorities
   from modern theologians might be added. We give only the testimony of
   Dr. Jackson, one of the most distinguished theologians of the Church of
   England: "After this defection of the Romish Church in the bishop
   Liberius, the whole Roman empire was overspread within Arianism." [96]

   Whatever doubt may exist as to details, the general fact of this
   apostasy cannot be doubted. Through defection from the truth, through
   the arts of the dominant party, through the influence of the emperor,
   the great majority of the bishops did join in condemnation of
   Athanasius, and in subscribing a formula of doctrine drawn up in
   opposition to the Nicene Creed; a formula afterwards renounced and
   condemned; a formula which the Bishop of Rome was banished for two
   years for refusing to sign, and restored to his see when he consented
   to subscribe. If, then, we apply to this case the same rules which are
   applied to the decisions of the Nicene Council, it must be admitted
   that the external Church apostastized as truly under Constantius, as it
   professed the true faith under Constantine. If many signed the Eusebian
   or Arian formula insincerely, so did many hypocritically assent to the
   decrees of Nice. If many were overborne by authority and fear in the
   one case, so they were in the other. If many revoked their assent to
   Arianism, quite as many withdrew their consent to the Athanasian
   doctrine.

   The Romish Evasion of this Argument.

   In dealing within this undeniable fact, Romanists and Romanizers are
   forced to abandon their principle. Their doctrine is that the external
   Church cannot err, that the majority of the bishops living at any one
   time cannot fail to teach the truth. But under the reign of the Emperor
   Constantius, it is undeniable that the vast majority, including the
   Bishop of Rome, did renounce the truth. But, says Bellarmin, [97] the
   Church continued and was conspicuous in Athanasius, Hilary, Eusebius,
   and others. And Mr. Palmer, of Oxford says, [98] "The truth was
   preserved under even Arian bishops." But the question is not, whether
   the truth shall be preserved and confessed by the true children of God,
   but, whether any external, organized body, and specially the Church of
   Rome, can err in its teaching. Romanists cannot be allowed, merely to
   meet an emergency, to avail themselves of the Protestant doctrine that
   the Church may consist of scattered believers. It is true as Jerome
   teaches in the passage above quoted, "Ubi fides vera est, ibi Ecclesia
   est." But that is our doctrine, and not the doctrine of Rome.
   Protestants say with full confidence, "Ecclesia manet et manebit." But
   whether in conspicuous glory as in the time of David, or in scattered
   believers as in the days of Elias, is not essential.

   The Church of Rome rejects the Doctrines of Augustine.

   A second case in which the external church (and specially the Church of
   Rome) has departed from what it had itself declared to be true, is in
   the rejection of the doctrines known in history as Augustinian. That
   the peculiar doctrines of Augustine, including the doctrine of sinful
   corruption of nature derived from Adam, which is spiritual death, and
   involves entire inability on the part of the sinner to convert himself
   or to cooperate in his own regeneration; the necessity of the certainly
   efficacious operation of divine grace; the sovereignty of God in
   election and reprobation, and the certain perseverance of the saints;
   were sanctioned by the whole Church, and specially by the Church of
   Rome, cannot be disputed. The eighteenth chapter of Wiggers'
   "Augustinianism and Pelagianism," is headed, "The final adoption of the
   Augustinian system for all Christendom by the third ecumenical council
   of Ephesus. A.D. 431." It is not denied that many of the eastern
   bishops, perhaps the majority of them, were secretly opposed to that
   system in its essential features. All that is insisted upon is that the
   whole Church, through what Romanists recognize as its official organs,
   gave its sanction to Augustine's peculiar doctrines; and that so far as
   the Latin Church is concerned this assent was not only for the time
   general but cordial. It is no less certain that the Council of Trent,
   while it condemned Pelagianism, and even the peculiar doctrine of
   semi-Pelagians, who said that man began the work of conversion, thus
   denying the necessity of preventing grace (gratia preveniens),
   nevertheless repudiated the distinguishing doctrines of Augustine and
   anathematized all who held them.

   G. The Church of Rome now teaches Error.

   A fifth argument against the infallibility of the Church of Rome, is
   that, that Church now teaches error. Of this there can be no reasonable
   doubt, if the Scriptures be admitted as the standard of judgment.

   1. It is a monstrous error, contrary to the Bible, to its letter and
   spirit, and shocking to the common sense of mankind, that the salvation
   of men should be suspended on their acknowledging the Pope to be the
   head of the Church in the world, or the vicar of Christ. This makes
   salvation independent of faith and character. A man may be sincere and
   intelligent in his faith in God and Christ, and perfectly exemplary in
   his Christian life, yet if he does not acknowledge the Pope, he must
   perish forever.

   2. It is a grievous error, contrary to the express teachings of the
   Bible, that the sacraments are the only channels of communicating to
   men the benefits of redemption. In consequence of this false
   assumption, Romanists teach that all who die unbaptized, even infants,
   are lost.

   3. It is a great error to teach as the Church of Rome does teach, that
   the ministers of the gospel are priests; that the people have no access
   to God or Christ, and cannot obtain the remission of sins or other
   saving blessings, except through their intervention and by their
   ministrations; that the priests have the power not only of declarative,
   but of judicial and effective absolution, so that those and those only
   whom they absolve stand acquitted at the bar of God. This was the grand
   reason for the Reformation, which was a rebellion against this priestly
   domination; a demand or the part of the people for the liberty
   wherewith Christ had made them free, -- the liberty to go immediately
   to him with their sins and sorrows, and find relief without the
   intervention or permission of any man who has no better right of access
   than themselves.

   4. The doctrine of the merit of good works as taught by Romanists is
   another most prolific error. They hold that works done after
   regeneration have real merit (meritum condigni), and that they are the
   ground of the sinners justification before God. They hold that a man
   may do more than the law requires of him, and perform works of
   supererogation, and thus obtain more merit than is necessary for his
   own salvation and beatification. That this superfluous merit goes into
   the treasury of the Church, and may be dispensed for the benefit of
   others. On this ground indulgences are granted or sold, to take effect
   not only in this life but in the life to come.

   5. With this is connected the further error concerning Purgatory. The
   Church of Rome teaches that those dying in the communion of the Church,
   who have not in this life made full satisfaction for their sins, or
   acquired sufficient merit to entitle them to admission into heaven, do
   at death pass into a state of suffering, there to remain until due
   satisfaction is made and proper purification is effected. There is no
   necessary termination to this state of purgatory but the day of
   judgment or the end of the world. It may last for a thousand or many
   thousands of years. But Purgatory is under the power of the keys. The
   sufferings of souls in that state may be alleviated or shortened by the
   authorized ministers of the Church. There is no limit to the power of
   men who are believed to hold the keys of heaven in their hand, to shut
   and no man opens, and open and no man shuts. Of all incredibilities the
   most incredible is that God would commit such power as this, to weak,
   ignorant, and often wicked men.

   6. The Romish Church teaches grievous error concerning the Lord's
   Supper. It teaches, (1.) That when consecrated by the priest the whole
   substance of the bread and the whole substance of the wine are
   transmuted into the substance of the body and blood of Christ. (2.)
   That as his body is inseparable from his soul and divinity, where the
   one is there the other must be. The whole Christ, therefore, body,
   soul, and divinity, is present in the consecrated wafer, which is to be
   worshipped as Christ himself is worshipped. This is the reason why the
   Church of England in her Homilies pronounces the service of the Mass in
   the Romish Church idolatrous. (3.) That Church further teaches that the
   body and blood of Christ thus locally and substantially present in the
   Eucharist are offered as a true propitiatory sacrifice for the
   forgiveness of sin, the application of which is determined by the
   intention of the officiating priests.

   7. Idolatry consists not only in the worship of false gods, but in the
   worship of the true God by images. The second Commandment of the
   Decalogue expressly forbids the bowing down to, or serving the likeness
   of anything in heaven above or in the earth beneath. In the Hebrew the
   words used are, hstchvh and tsvd. In the Septuagint the words are, ou
   proskuneseis autois, oude me latreuseis autois. In the Vulgate it
   reads, "Non adorabis ea neque coles." The precise thing, therefore,
   that is forbidden is that which the Church of Rome permits and enjoins,
   namely, the use of images in religious worship, prostration before
   them, and doing them reverence.

   8. Another great error of the Church of Rome is the worship of saints
   and angels, and especially of the Virgin Mary. It is not merely that
   they are regarded as objects of reverence, but that the service
   rendered them involves the ascription of divine attributes. They are
   assumed to be everywhere present, able to hear and answer prayer, to
   help and to save. They become the ground of confidence to the people,
   and the objects of their religious affections. They are to them
   precisely what the gods of the heathen were to the Greeks and Romans.

   Such are some of the errors taught by the Church of Rome, and they
   prove that that Church instead of being infallible, is so corrupt that
   it is the duty of the people of God to come out of it and to renounce
   its fellowship.

   H. The Recognition of an Infallible Church incompatible with either
   Religious or Civil Liberty.

   A church which claims to be infallible, ipso facto, claims to be the
   mistress of the world; and those who admit its infallibility, thereby
   admit their entire subjection to its authority. It avails nothing to
   say that this infallibility is limited to matters of faith and morals,
   for under those heads is included the whole life of man, religious,
   moral, domestic, social, and political.

   A church which claims the right to decide what is true in doctrine and
   obligatory in morals, and asserts the power to enforce submission to
   its decisions on the pain of eternal perdition, leaves no room for any
   other authority upon earth. In the presence of the authority of God,
   every other disappears.

   With the claim to infallibility is inseparably connected the claim to
   pardon sin. The Church does not assume merely the right to declare the
   conditions on which sin will be forgiven at the bar of God, but it
   asserts that it has the prerogative to grant, or to withhold that
   forgiveness. "Ego te absolvo," is the formula the Church puts into the
   mouth of its priesthood. Those who receive that absolution are saved;
   those whom the Church refuses to absolve must bear the penalty of their
   offences.

   An infallible church is thus the only institute of salvation. All
   within its pale are saved; all without it perish. Those only are in the
   Church who believe what it teaches, who do what it commands, and are
   subject to its officers, and especially its head, the Roman pontiff.
   Any man, therefore, whom the Church excommunicates is thereby shut out
   of the kingdom of heaven; any nation placed under its ban is not only
   deprived of the consolations of religious services, but of the
   necessary means of salvation.

   If the Church be infallible, its authority is no less absolute in the
   sphere of social and political life. It is immoral to contract or to
   continue an unlawful marriage, to keep an unlawful oath, to enact
   unjust laws, to obey a sovereign hostile to the Church. The Church,
   therefore, has the right to dissolve marriages, to free men from the
   obligations of their oaths, and citizens from their allegiance, to
   abrogate civil laws, and to depose sovereigns. These prerogatives have
   not only been claimed, but time and again exercised by the Church of
   Rome. They all of right belong to that Church, if it be infallible. As
   these claims are enforced by penalties involving the loss of the soul,
   they cannot be resisted by those who admit the Church to be infallible.
   It is obvious, therefore, that where this doctrine is held there can be
   no liberty of opinion, no freedom of conscience, no civil or political
   freedom. As the recent ecumenical Council of the Vatican has decided
   that this infallibility is vested in the Pope, it is henceforth a
   matter of faith with Romanists, that the Roman pontiff is the absolute
   sovereign of the world. All men are bound, on the penalty of eternal
   death, to believe what he declares to be true, and to do whatever he
   decides is obligatory.

CHAPTER VI.

  THE PROTESTANT RULE OF FAITH.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Statement of the Doctrine.

   All Protestants agree in teaching that "the word of God, as contained
   in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, is the only infallible
   rule of faith and practice."

   In the Smalcald Articles, [99] the Lutheran Church says "Ex patrum --
   verbis et factis non sunt exstrueudi articuli fidei -- Regulam autem
   aliam habemus, ut videlicet verbum Dei condat articulos fidei et
   præterea nemo, ne angelus quidem." In the "Form of Concord," [100] it
   is said: "Credimus, confitemur et docemus, unicam regulam et normam
   secundum quam omnia dogmata omnesque doctores æstimari et judicari
   oporteat, nullam omnino aliam esse, quam prophetica et apostolica
   scripta cum V. tum N. Testamenti."

   The symbols of the Reformed churches teach the same doctrine. Confessio
   Helvetica, II. [101] says: "In scriptura sancta habet unversalis
   Christi Ecclesia plenissime exposita, quæcunque pertinent cum ad
   salvificam fidem, tum ad vitam Deo placentem. [102] Non alium in causa
   fidei judicem, quam ipsum Deum per Scripturas sacras pronuntiantem,
   quid verum sit, quid falsum, quid sequendum sit quidne fugiendum.
   Confessio Gallicana: [103] Quum hæc (SS.) sit omnis veritatis summa,
   complectens quidquid ad cultum Dei et salutem nostram requiritur, neque
   hominibus neque ipsis etiam angelis fas esse dicimus quicquam ei verbo
   adjicere vel detrahere vel quicquam prorsus in eo immutare." In the
   Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England, [104] it is said: "Holy
   Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that
   whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be
   required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of faith,
   or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation." The Westminster
   Confession [105] teaches: "Under the name of Holy Scripture, or the
   Word of God written, are now contained all the books of the Old and New
   Testament, which are these: etc. . . . . All which are given by
   inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and life. [106] The whole
   counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own glory, man's
   salvation, faith, and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture,
   or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture;
   unto which nothing at any time is to be added whether by new
   revelations of the Spirit or traditions of men. [107] All things in
   Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all;
   yet those things which are necessary to be known, believed, and
   observed, for salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened in some
   place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the
   unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a
   sufficient understanding of them."

   From these statements it appears that Protestants hold, (1.) That the
   Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are the Word of God, written
   under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and are therefore infallible,
   and of divine authority in all things pertaining to faith and practice,
   and consequently free from all error whether of doctrine, fact, or
   precept. (2.) That they contain all the extant supernatural revelations
   of God designed to be a rule of faith and practice to his Church. (3.)
   That they are sufficiently perspicuous to be understood by the people,
   in the use of ordinary means and by the aid of the Holy Spirit, in all
   things necessary to faith or practice, without the need of any
   infallible interpreter.

   The Canon.

   Before entering on the consideration of these points, it is necessary
   to answer the question, What books are entitled to a place in the
   canon, or rule of faith and practice? Romanists answer this question by
   saying, that all those which the Church has decided to be divine in
   their origin, and none others, are to be thus received. Protestants
   answer it by saying, so far as the Old Testament is concerned, that
   those books, and those only, which Christ and his Apostles recognized
   as the written Word of God, are entitled to be regarded as canonical.
   This recognition was afforded in a twofold manner: First, many of the
   books of the Old Testament are quoted as the Word of God, as being
   given by the Spirit; or the Spirit is said to have uttered what is
   therein recorded. Secondly, Christ and his Apostles refer to the sacred
   writings of the Jews -- the volume which they regarded as divine -- as
   being what it claimed to be, the Word of God. When we refer to the
   Bible as of divine authority, we refer to it as a volume and recognize
   all the writings which it contains as given by the inspiration of the
   Spirit. In like manner when Christ or his Apostles quote the
   "Scriptures," or the "law and the prophets," and speak of the volume
   then so called, they give their sanction to the divine authority of all
   the books which that volume contained. All, therefore, that is
   necessary to determine for Christians the canon of the Old Testament,
   is to ascertain what books were included in the "Scriptures" recognized
   by the Jews of that period. This is a point about which there is no
   reasonable doubt. The Jewish canon of the Old Testament included all
   the books and no others, which Protestants now recognize as
   constituting the Old Testament Scriptures. On this ground Protestants
   reject the so-called apocryphal books. They were not written in Hebrew
   and were not included in the canon of the Jews. They were, therefore,
   not recognized by Christ as the Word of God. This reason is of itself
   sufficient. It is however confirmed by considerations drawn from the
   character of the books themselves. They abound in errors, and in
   statements contrary to those found in the undoubtedly canonical books.

   The principle on which the canon of the New Testament is determined is
   equally simple. Those books, and those only which can be proved to have
   been written by the Apostles, or to have received their sanction, are
   to be recognized as of divine authority. The reason of this rule is
   obvious. The Apostles were the duly authenticated messengers of Christ,
   of whom He said, "He that heareth you, heareth me."

   § 2. The Scriptures are Infallible, i. e., given by Inspiration of God.

   The infallibility and divine authority of the Scriptures are due to the
   fact that they are the word of God; and they are the word of God
   because they were given by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.

   A. The Nature of Inspiration. Definition.

   The nature of inspiration is to be learnt from the Scriptures; from
   their didactic statements, and from their phenomena. There are certain
   general facts or principles which underlie the Bible, which are assumed
   in all its teachings, and which therefore must be assumed in its
   interpretation. We must, for example, assume, (1.) That God is not the
   unconscious ground of all things; nor an unintelligent force; nor a
   name for the moral order of the universe; nor mere causality; but a
   Spirit, -- a self-conscious, intelligent, voluntary agent, possessing
   all the attributes of our spirits without limitation, and to an
   infinite degree. (2.) That He is the creator of the world, and
   extra-mundane, existing before, and independently of it; not its soul,
   life, or animating principle; but its maker, preserver, and ruler. (3.)
   That as a spirit He is everywhere present, and everywhere active,
   preserving and governing all his creatures and all their actions. (4.)
   That while both in the external world and in the world of mind He
   generally acts according to fixed laws and through secondary causes, He
   is free to act, and often does act immediately, or without the
   intervention of such causes, as in creation, regeneration, and
   miracles. (5.) That the Bible contains a divine, or supernatural
   revelation. The present question is not, Whether the Bible is what it
   claims to be; but, What does it teach as to the nature and effects of
   the influence under which it was written?

   On this subject the common doctrine of the Church is, and ever has
   been, that inspiration was an influence of the Holy Spirit on the minds
   of certain select men, which rendered them the organs of God for the
   infallible communication of his mind and will. They were in such a
   sense the organs of God, that what they said God said.

   B. Inspiration Supernatural.

   This definition includes several distinct points. First. Inspiration is
   a supernatural influence. It is thus distinguished, on the one hand
   from the providential agency of God, which is everywhere and always in
   operation; and on the other hand, from the gracious operations of the
   Spirit on the hearts of his people. According to the Scriptures, and
   the common views of men, a marked distinction is to be made between
   those effects which are due to the efficiency of God operating
   regularly through second causes, and those which are produced by his
   immediate efficiency without the intervention of such causes. The one
   class of effects is natural; the other, supernatural. Inspiration
   belongs to the latter class. It is not a natural effect due to the
   inward state of its subject, or to the influence of external
   circumstances.

   No less obvious is the distinction which the Bible makes between the
   gracious operations of the Spirit and those by which extraordinary
   gifts are bestowed upon particular persons. Inspiration, therefore, is
   not to be confounded with spiritual illumination. They differ, first,
   as to their subjects. The subjects of inspiration are a few selected
   persons; the subjects of spiritual illumination are all true believers.
   And, secondly, they differ as to their design. The design of the former
   is to render certain men infallible as teachers. the design of the
   latter is to render men holy; and of course they differ as to their
   effects. Inspiration in itself has no sanctifying influence. Balaam was
   inspired. Saul was among the prophets. Caiaphas uttered a prediction
   which "he spake not of himself." (John xi. 51.) In the last day many
   will be able to say to Christ, "Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in
   thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done
   many wonderful works?" To whom he will say: "I never knew you; depart
   from me, ye that work iniquity." (Matt. vii. 22, 23.)

   C. Distinction between Revelation and Inspiration.

   Second. The above definition assumes a difference between revelation
   and inspiration. They differ, first, as to their object. The object of
   revelation is the communication of knowledge. The object or design of
   inspiration is to secure infallibility in teaching. Consequently they
   differ, secondly, in their effects. The effect of revelation was to
   render its recipient wiser. The effect of inspiration was to preserve
   him from error in teaching. These two gifts were often enjoyed by the
   same person at the same time. That is, the Spirit often imparted
   knowledge, and controlled in its communication orally or in writing to
   others. This was no doubt the case with the Psalmists, and often with
   the Prophets and Apostles. Often, however, the revelations were made at
   one time, and were subsequently, under the guidance of the Spirit,
   committed to writing. Thus the Apostle Paul tells us that he received
   his knowledge of the gospel not from man, but by revelation from Jesus
   Christ; and this knowledge he communicated from time to time in his
   discourses and epistles. In many cases these gifts were separated. Many
   of the sacred writers, although inspired, received no revelations. This
   was probably the fact with the authors of the historical books of the
   Old Testament. The evangelist Luke does not refer his knowledge of the
   events which he records to revelation, but says he derived it from
   those which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the
   Word." (Luke i. 2.) It is immaterial to us where Moses obtained his
   knowledge of the events recorded in the book of Genesis; whether from
   early documents, from tradition, or from direct revelation. No more
   causes are to be assumed for any effect than are necessary. If the
   sacred writer had sufficient sources of knowledge in themselves, or in
   those about them, there is no need to assume any direct revelation. It
   is enough for us that they were rendered infallible as teachers. This
   distinction between revelation and inspiration is commonly made by
   systematic writers. Thus Quenstedt (1685) [108] says: "Distingue inter
   revelationem et inspirationem. Revelatio vi vocis est manifestatio
   rerum ignotarum et occultarum, et potest fieri multis et diversis
   modis. . . . . Inspiratio . . . . est interna conceptum suggestio, seu
   infusio, sive res conceptæ jam ante scriptori fuerint cognitæ, sive
   occultæ. Illa potuit tempore antecedere scriptionem, hæc cum scriptione
   semper fuit conjuncta et in ipsam scriptionem influebat." Often,
   however, the distinction in question is overlooked. In popular
   language, inspiration is made to include both the supernatural
   communication of truth to the mind, and a supernatural control in
   making known that truth to others. The two gifts, however, differ in
   their nature, and should therefore be distinguished. Confounding them
   has sometimes led to serious error. When no revelation was necessary,
   no inspiration is admitted. Thus Grotius says: "Vere dixi non omnes
   libros qui sunt in Hebræo Canone dictatos a Spiritu Sancto. Scriptos
   esse cum pio animi motu, non nego; et hoc est quod judicavit Synagoga
   Magna, cujus judicio in hac re stant Hebræi. Sed a Spiritu Sancto
   dictari historias nihil fuit opus: satis fuit scriptorem memoria valere
   circa res spectatas, aut diligentia in describendis veterum
   commentariis." [109] It is an illogical conclusion, however, to infer
   that because a historian did not need to have the facts dictated to
   him, that therefore he needed no control to preserve him from error.

   D. Inspired Men the Organs of God.

   A third point included in the Church doctrine of inspiration is, that
   the sacred writers were the organs of God, so that what they taught,
   God taught. It is to be remembered, however, that when God uses any of
   his creatures as his instruments, He uses them according to their
   nature. He uses angels as angels, men as men, the elements as elements.
   Men are intelligent voluntary agents; and as such were made the organs
   of God. The sacred writers were not made unconscious or irrational. The
   spirits of the prophets were subject to the prophets. (1 Cor. xiv. 32.)
   They were not like calculating machines which grind out logarithms with
   infallible correctness. The ancients, indeed, were accustomed to say,
   as some theologians have also said, that the sacred writers were as
   pens in the hand of the Spirit; or as harps, from which He drew what
   sounds He pleased. These representations were, however, intended simply
   to illustrate one point, namely, that the words uttered or recorded by
   inspired men were the words of God. The Church has never held what has
   been stigmatized as thc mechanical theory of inspiration. The sacred
   writers were not machines. Their self-consciousness was not suspended;
   nor were their intellectual powers superseded. Holy men spake as they
   were moved by the Holy Ghost. It was men, not machines; not unconscious
   instruments, but living, thinking, willing minds, whom the Spirit used
   as his organs. Moreover, as inspiration did not involve the suspension
   or suppression of the human faculties, so neither did it interfere with
   the free exercise of the distinctive mental characteristics of the
   individual. If a Hebrew was inspired, he spake Hebrew; if a Greek, he
   spake Greek; if an educated man, he spoke as a man of culture; if
   uneducated, he spoke as such a man is wont to speak. If his mind was
   logical, he reasoned, as Paul did; if emotional and contemplative, he
   wrote as John wrote. All this is involved in the fact that God uses his
   instruments according to their nature. The sacred writers impressed
   their peculiarities on their several productions as plainly as though
   they were the subjects of no extraordinary influence. This is one of
   the phenomena of the Bible patent to the most cursory reader. It lies
   in the very nature of inspiration that God spake in the language of
   men; that He uses men as his organs, each according to his peculiar
   gifts and endowments. When He ordains praise out of the mouth of babes,
   they must speak as babes, or the whole power and beauty of the tribute
   will be lost. There is no reason to believe that the operation of the
   Spirit in inspiration revealed itself any more in the consciousness of
   the sacred writers, than his operations in sanctification reveal
   themselves in the consciousness of the Christian. As the believer seems
   to himself to act, and in fact does act out of his own nature; so the
   inspired penmen wrote out of the fulness of their own thoughts and
   feelings, and employed the language and modes of expression which to
   them were the most natural and appropriate. Nevertheless, and none the
   less, they spoke as they were proved by the Holy Ghost, and their words
   were his words.

   E. Proof of the Doctrine.

   That this is the Scriptural view of inspiration; that inspired men were
   the organs of God in such a sense that their words are to be received
   not as the words of men, but as they are in truth, as the words of God
   (1 Thess. ii. 13), is proved, --

   1. From the signification and usage of the word. It is, of course,
   admitted that words are to be understood in their historical sense. If
   it can be shown what idea the men living in the apostolic age attached
   to the word theopneustos and its equivalents, that is the idea which
   the Apostles intended to express by them. All nations have entertained
   the belief not only that God has access to the human mind and can
   control its operations, but that He at times did take such possession
   of particular persons as to make them the organs of his communications.
   Such persons were called by the Greeks theophoroi (those who bore a God
   within them); or, enthios (those in whom a God dwelt). In the
   Septuagint the word pneumatophoros used in the same sense. In Josephus,
   [110] the idea is expressed by the phrase "to theio pneumati
   kekinemenos;" to which the words of Peter (2 Peter i. 21) exactly
   answer, hupo pneumatos pheromenoi; and what is written by men under
   this influence of the Spirit is called graphe theopneustos. (2 Tim.
   iii. 16.) Gregory of Nyssa, [111] having quoted the words of our Lord
   in Matt. xxii. 43, "How then doth David in Spirit call him Lord," adds,
   oukoun te dunamei tou Pneumatos hoi theophoroumenoi ton agion
   empneontai`, kai dia touto pasa graphe theopneustos legetai, dia to tes
   theias epneuseos einai didaskalian, that is, "Hence those of the saints
   who by the power of the Spirit are full of God are inspired, and
   therefore all Scripture is called theopneustos, because the instruction
   is by divine inspiration." The idea of inspiration is therefore fixed.
   It is not to be arbitrarily determined. We must not interpret the word
   or the fact, according to our theories of the relation of God to the
   world, but according to the usage of antiquity, sacred and profane, and
   according to the doctrine which the sacred writers and the men of their
   generation are known to have entertained on the subject. According to
   all antiquity, an inspired man was one who was the organ of God in what
   he said, so that his words were the words of the god of which he was
   the organ. When, therefore, the sacred writers use the same words and
   forms of expression which the ancients used to convey that idea, they
   must in all honesty be assumed to mean the same thing.

   Argument from the Meaning of the Word Prophet.

   2. That this is the Scriptural idea of inspiration is further proved
   from the meaning of the word prophet. The sacred writers divide the
   Scriptures into the "law and the prophets." As the law was written by
   Moses, and as Moses was the greatest of the prophets, it follows that
   all the Old Testament was written by prophets. If, therefore, we can
   determine the Scriptural idea of a prophet, we shall thereby determine
   the character of their writings and the authority due to them. A
   prophet, then, in the Scriptural sense of the term, is a spokesman, one
   who speaks for another, in his name, and by his authority; so that it
   is not the spokesman but the person for whom he acts, who is
   responsible for the truth of what is said. In Exodus vii. 1, it is
   said, "See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother
   shall be thy prophet," i. e., thy spokesman. This is explained by what
   is said in Exodus iv. 14-16, "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I
   know that he can speak well. . . . . Thou shalt speak unto him, and put
   words into his mouth; and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth,
   and will teach you what ye shall do. And he shall be thy spokesman unto
   the people; and he shall be, even he shall be, to thee instead of a
   mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God." (See Jeremiah xxxvi.
   17, 18.) This determines definitely, what a prophet is. He is the mouth
   of God; one through whom God speaks to the people; so that what the
   prophet says God says. So when a prophet was consecrated, it was said,
   "Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth." (Jer. i. 9; Is. li. 16.)
   That this is the Scriptural idea of a prophet is moreover evident from
   the formulas, constantly recurring, which relate to his duties and
   mission. He was the messenger of God; he spoke in the name of God; the
   words, "Thus saith the Lord," were continually in his mouth. "The word
   of the Lord" is said to have come to this prophet and on that; "the
   Spirit came upon," "the power," or "hand" of God was upon him; all
   implying that the prophet was the organ of God, that what he said, he
   said in God's name and by his authority. It is true, therefore, as
   Philo [112] says, prophetes gar idion ouden apophthengetai allotria de
   panta hupechountos hetepou.

   This is precisely what the Apostle Peter teaches when he says (2 Peter
   i. 20, 21), "No prophecy of the Scripture is of any private
   interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of
   man: but holy men spake as they were moved (pheromenoi, borne along as
   a ship by the wind) by the Holy Ghost." Prophecy, i. e., what a prophet
   said, was not human, but divine. It was not the prophet's own
   interpretation of the mind and will of God. He spoke as the organ of
   the Holy Ghost.

   What the Prophets said God said.

   3. It is another decisive proof that the sacred writers were the organs
   of God in the sense above stated, that whatever they said the Spirit is
   declared to have said. Christ himself said that David by the Spirit
   called the Messiah Lord. (Matt. xxii. 43.) David in the 95th Psalm
   said, "To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your heart;" but
   the Apostle (Heb. iii. 7), says that these were the words of the Holy
   Ghost. Again, in ch. x. 15, the same Apostle says, "Whereof the Holy
   Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before, This
   is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the
   Lord." Thus quoting the language of Jeremiah xxxi. 33, as the language
   of the Holy Ghost. In Acts iv. 25, the assembled Apostles said, "with
   one accord," "Lord thou art God. . . . . Who by the mouth of thy
   servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage?" In Acts xxviii. 25,
   Paul said to the Jews, "Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet
   unto our fathers." It is in this way that Christ and his Apostles
   constantly refer to the Scriptures, showing beyond doubt that they
   believed and taught, that what the sacred writers said the Holy Ghost
   said.

   Inspiration of the New Testament Writers.

   This proof bears specially, it is true, only on the writings of the Old
   Testament. But no Christian puts the inspiration of the Old Testament
   above that of the New. The tendency, and we may even say the evidence,
   is directly the other way. If the Scriptures of the old economy were
   given by inspiration of God, much more were those writings which were
   penned under the dispensation of the Spirit. Besides, the inspiration
   of the Apostles is proved, (1.) From the fact that Christ promised them
   the Holy Spirit, who should bring all things to their remembrance, and
   render them infallible in teaching. It is not you, He said, that speak,
   but the Spirit of my Father speaketh in you. He that heareth you
   heareth me. He forbade them to enter upon their office as teachers
   until they were endued with power from on high. (2) This promise was
   fulfilled on the day of Pentecost, when the Spirit descended upon the
   Apostles as a mighty rushing wind, and they were filled with the Holy
   Ghost, and began to speak as the Spirit gave them utterance (dabat
   eloqui, as the Vulgate more literally renders the words). From this
   moment they were new men, with new views, with new spirit, and with new
   power and authority. The change was sudden. It was not a development.
   It was something altogether supernatural; as when God said, Let there
   be light, and there was light. Nothing can be more unreasonable than to
   ascribe this sudden transformation of the Apostles from narrow-minded,
   bigoted Jews, into enlightened, large-minded, catholic Christians, to
   mere natural causes. Their Jewish prejudices had resisted all the
   instructions and influence of Christ for three years, but gave way in a
   moment when the Spirit came upon them from on high. (3.) After the day
   of Pentecost the Apostles claimed to be the infallible organs of God in
   all their teachings They required men to receive what they taught not
   as the word of man but as the word of God (1 Thess. ii. 13); then
   declared as Paul does (1 Cor. xiv. 37), that the things which they
   wrote were the commandments of the Lord. They made the salvation of men
   to depend on faith in the doctrines which they taught. Paul pronounces
   anathema even an angel from heaven who should preach any other gospel
   than that which he had taught. (Gal. i. 8.) John says that whoever did
   not receive the testimony which he bore concerning Christ, made God a
   liar, because John's testimony was God's testimony. (1 John v. 10.) "He
   that knoweth God, heareth us; he that is not of God, heareth not us."
   (iv. 6.) This assertion of infallibility, this claim for the divine
   authority of their teaching, is characteristic of the whole Bible. The
   sacred writers all, and everywhere, disclaim personal authority; they
   never rest the obligation to faith in their teachings, on their own
   knowledge or wisdom; they never rest it on the truth of what they
   taught as manifest to reason or as capable of being proved by argument.
   They speak as messengers, as witnesses, as organs. They declare that
   what they said God said, and, therefore, on his authority it was to be
   received and obeyed.

   The Testimony of Paul.

   The Corinthians objected to Paul's preaching that he did not attempt
   any rational or philosophical proof of the doctrines which he
   propounded; that his language and whole manner of discourse were not in
   accordance with rhetorical rules. He answers these objections, --
   first, by saying that the doctrines which he taught were not the truths
   of reason, were not derived from the wisdom of men, but were matters of
   divine revelation; that he simply taught what God declared to be true;
   and secondly, that as to the manner of presenting these truths, he was
   the mere organ of the Spirit of God. In 1 Cor. ii. 7-13, he sets forth
   this whole subject in the clearest and most concise manner. The things
   which he taught, which he calls "the wisdom of God," "the things of the
   Spirit," i. e., the gospel, the system of doctrine taught in the Bible,
   he says, had never entered into the mind of man. God had revealed those
   truths by his Spirit; for the Spirit is the only competent source of
   such knowledge. "For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the
   spirit of man which is in him? even so, the things of God knoweth no
   man, but the Spirit of God." So much for the source of knowledge, and
   the ground on which the doctrines he taught were to be received. As to
   the second objection, which concerned his language and mode of
   presentation, he says, These things of the Spirit, thus revealed, we
   teach "not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth; but which the Holy
   Ghost teacheth," pneumatikois pneumatika sunkrinontes, combining
   spiritual with spiritual, i. e., clothing the truths of the Spirit in
   the words of the Spirit. There is neither in the Bible nor in the
   writings of men, a simpler or clearer statement of the doctrines of
   revelation and inspiration. Revelation is the act of communicating
   divine knowledge by the Spirit to the mind. Inspiration is the act of
   the same Spirit, controlling those who make the truth known to others.
   The thoughts, the truths made known, and the words in which they are
   recorded, are declared to be equally from the Spirit. This, from first
   to last, has been the doctrine of the Church, notwithstanding the
   endless diversity of speculations in which theologians have indulged on
   the subject. This then is the ground on which the sacred writers rested
   their claims. They were the mere organs of God. They were his
   messengers. Those who heard them, heard God; and those who refused to
   hear them, refused to hear God. (Matt. x. 40; John xiii. 20.)

   4. This claim to infallibility on the part of the Apostles was duly
   authenticated, not only by the nature of the truths which they
   communicated, and by the power which those truths have ever exerted
   over the minds and hearts of men, but also by the inward witness of the
   Spirit of which St. John speaks, when he says, "He that believeth on
   the Son of God hath the witness in himself" (1 John v. 10); "an unction
   from the Holy One." (1 John ii. 20.) It was confirmed also by
   miraculous gifts. As soon as the Apostles were endued with power from
   on high, they spake in "other tongues;" they healed the sick, restored
   the lame and the blind, "God also," as the Apostle says (Heb. ii. 4),
   "bearing them witness, both with signs, and wonders, and with divers
   miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will." And
   Paul tells the Corinthians that the signs of an Apostle had been
   wrought among them "in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty
   deeds." (2 Cor. xii. 12.) The mere working of miracles was not an
   evidence of a divine commission as a teacher. But when a man claims to
   be the organ of God, when he says that God speaks through him, then his
   working of miracles is the testimony of God to the validity of his
   claims. And such testimony God gave to the infallibility of the
   Apostles.

   The above considerations are sufficient to show, that according to the
   Scriptures, inspired men were the organs, or mouth of God, in the sense
   that what they said and taught has the sanction and authority of God.

   F. Inspiration extends equally to all Parts of Scripture.

   This is the fourth element of the Church doctrine on this subject. It
   means, first, that all the books of Scripture are equally inspired. All
   alike are infallible in what they teach. And secondly, that inspiration
   extends to all the contents of these several books. It is not confined
   to moral and religious truths, but extends to the statements of facts,
   whether scientific, historical, or geographical. It is not confined to
   those facts the importance of which is obvious, or which are involved
   in matters of doctrine. It extends to everything which any sacred
   writer asserts to be true.

   This is proved, (1) Because it is involved in, or follows as a
   necessary consequence from, the proposition that the sacred writers
   were the organs of God. If what they assert, God asserts, which, as has
   been shown, is the Scriptural idea of inspiration, their assertions
   must be free from error. (2.) Because our Lord expressly says, "The
   Scripture cannot be broken" (John x. 35), i.e., it cannot err. (3.)
   Because Christ and his Apostles refer to all parts of the Scriptures,
   or to the whole volume, as the word of God. They make no distinction as
   to the authority of the Law, the Prophets, or the Hagiographa. They
   quote the Pentateuch, the historical books, the Psalms, and the
   Prophets, as all and equally the word of God. (4.) Because Christ and
   the writers of the New Testament refer to all classes of facts recorded
   in the Old Testament as infallibly true. Not only doctrinal facts, such
   as those of the creation and probation of man; his apostasy; the
   covenant with Abraham; the giving the law upon Mount Sinai not only
   great historical facts, as the deluge, the deliverance of the people
   out of Egypt, the passage of the Red Sea, and the like but incidental
   circumstances, or facts of apparently minor importance, as e.g. that
   Satan tempted our first parents in the form of serpent; that Moses
   lifted up a serpent in the wilderness: that Elijah healed Naaman, the
   Syrian, and was sent to the widow in Sarepta; that David ate the
   shew-bread in the temple; and even that great stumbling-block, that
   Jonah was three days in the whale's belly, are all referred to by our
   Lord and his Apostles with the sublime simplicity and confidence with
   which they are received by little children. (5.) It lies in the very
   idea of the Bible, that God chose some men to write history; some to
   indite psalms; some to unfold the future; some to teach doctrines. All
   were equally his organs, and each was infallible in his own sphere. As
   the principle of vegetable life pervades the whole plant, the root,
   stem, and flower; as the life of the body belongs as much to the feet
   as to the head, so the Spirit of God pervades the whole Scripture, and
   is not more important than in other. Some members of the body are more
   in one part than in another; and some books of the Bible could be far
   better spared than others. There may be as great a difference between
   St. John's Gospel and the Book of Chronicles as between a man's brain
   and his hair; nevertheless the life of the body is as truly in the hair
   as in the brain.

   G. The Inspiration of the Scriptures extends to the Words.

   1. This again is included in the infallibility which our Lord ascribes
   to the Scriptures. A mere human report or record of a divine revelation
   must of necessity be not only fallible, but more or less erroneous.

   2. The thoughts are in the words. The two are inseparable. If the
   words, priest, sacrifice, ransom, expiation, propitiation, purification
   by blood, and the like, have no divine authority, then the doctrine
   which they embody has no such authority.

   3. Christ and his Apostles argue from the very words of Scripture. Our
   Lord says that David by the Spirit called the Messiah Lord, i.e., David
   used that word. It was in the use of a particular word, that Christ
   said (John x. 35), that the Scriptures cannot be broken. "If he call
   them gods unto whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be
   broken," etc. The use of that word, therefore, according to Christ's
   view of the Scripture, was determined by the Spirit of God. Paul, in
   Gal. iii. 16, lays stress on the fact, that in the promise made to
   Abraham, a word used is singular and not plural, "seed," "as of one,"
   and not "seeds as of many." Constantly it is the very words of
   Scripture which are quoted as of divine authority.

   4. The very form in which the doctrine of inspiration is taught in the
   Bible, assumes that the organs of God in the communication of his will
   were controlled by Him in the words which they used. "I have put my
   words in thy mouth." (Jer. i. 9.) "It is not ye that speak, but the
   Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you." (Matt. x. 20.) They spake
   "as the Spirit gave them utterance." (Acts ii. 4.) "Holy men of God
   spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." (2 Pet. i. 21.) All these,
   and similar modes of expression with which the Scriptures abound, imply
   that the words uttered were the words of God. This, moreover, is the
   very idea of inspiration as understood by the ancient world. The words
   of the oracle were assumed to be the words of the divinity, and not
   those selected by the organ of communication. And this, too, as has
   been shown, was the idea attached to the gift of prophecy. The words of
   the prophet were the words of God, or he could not be God's spokesman
   and mouth. It has also been shown that in the most formally didactic
   passage in the whole Bible on this subject (1 Cor. ii. 10-13), the
   Apostle expressly asserts that the truths revealed by the Spirit, he
   communicated in words taught by the Spirit.

   Plenary Inspiration.

   The view presented above is known as the doctrine of plenary
   inspiration. Plenary is opposed to partial. The Church doctrine denies
   that inspiration is confined to parts of the Bible; and affirms that it
   applies to all the books of the sacred canon. It denies that the sacred
   writers were merely partially inspired; it asserts that they were fully
   inspired as to all that they teach, whether of doctrine or fact. This
   of course does not imply that the sacred writers were infallible except
   for the special purpose for which they were employed. They were not
   imbued with plenary knowledge. As to all matters of science,
   philosophy, and history, they stood on the same level with their
   contemporaries. They were infallible only as teachers, and when acting
   as the spokesmen of God. Their inspiration no more made them
   astronomers than it made them agriculturists. Isaiah was infallible in
   his predictions, although he shared with his countrymen the views then
   prevalent as to the mechanism of the universe. Paul could not err in
   anything he taught, although he could not recollect how many persons he
   had baptized in Corinth. The sacred writers also, doubtless, differed
   as to insight into the truths which they taught. The Apostle Peter
   intimates that the prophets searched diligently into the meaning of
   their own predictions. When David said God had put "all things" under
   the feet of man, he probably little thought that "all things" meant the
   whole universe (Heb. iv. 8.) And Moses, when he recorded the promise
   that childless Abraham was to be the father "of many nations," little
   thought that it meant the whole world (Rom. iv. 13). Nor does the
   Scriptural doctrine on this subject imply that the sacred writers were
   free from errors in conduct. Their infallibility did not arise from
   their holiness, nor did inspiration render them holy. Balaam was
   inspired, and Saul was among the prophets. David committed many crimes,
   although inspired to write psalms. Peter erred in conduct at Antioch;
   but this does not prove that he erred in teaching. The influence which
   preserved him from mistakes in teaching was not designed to preserve
   him from mistakes in conduct.

   H. General Considerations in Support of the Doctrine.

   On this point little need be said. If the questions, What is the
   Scriptural doctrine concerning inspiration? and, What is the true
   doctrine? be considered different, then after showing what the
   Scriptures teach on the subject, it would be necessary to prove that
   what they teach is true. This, however, is not the position of the
   Christian theologian. It is his business to set forth what the Bible
   teaches. If the sacred writers assert that they are the organs of God;
   that what they taught He taught through them; that they spoke as they
   were moved by the Holy Ghost, so that what they said the Holy Spirit
   said, then, if we believe their divine mission, we must believe what
   they teach as to the nature of the influence under which they spoke and
   wrote. This is the reason why in the earlier period of the Church there
   was no separate discussion of the doctrine of inspiration. That was
   regarded as involved in the divine origin of the Scriptures. If they
   are a revelation from God, they must be received and obeyed; but they
   cannot be thus received without attributing to them divine authority,
   and they can not have such authority without being infallible in all
   they teach.

   The organic unity of the Scriptures proves them to be the product of
   one mind. They are not only so united that we cannot believe one part
   without believing the whole; we cannot believe the New Testament
   without believing the Old; we cannot believe the Prophets without
   believing the Law; we cannot believe Christ without believing his
   Apostles; but besides all this they present the regular development,
   carried on through centuries and millenniums, of the great original
   promise, "The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head." This
   development was conducted by some forty independent writers, many of
   whom understood very little of the plan they were unfolding, but each
   contributed his part to the progress and completion of the whole.

   If the Bible be the work of one mind, that mind must be the mind of
   God. He only knows the end from the beginning. He only could know what
   the Bible reveals. No one, says the Apostle, knows the things of God
   but the Spirit of God. He only could reveal the nature, the thoughts,
   and purposes of God. He only could tell whether sin can be pardoned. No
   one knows the Son but the Father. The revelation of the person and work
   of Christ is as clearly the work of God as are the heavens in all their
   majesty and glory.

   Besides, we have the witness in ourselves. We find that the truths
   revealed in the Bible have the same adaptation to our souls that the
   atmosphere has to our bodies. The body cannot live without air, which
   it receives and appropriates instinctively, with full confidence in its
   adaptation to the end designed. In like manner the soul receives and
   appropriates the truths of Scripture as the atmosphere in which alone
   it can breathe and live. Thus in receiving the Bible as true, we
   necessarily receive it as divine. In believing it as a supernatural
   revelation, we believe its plenary inspiration.

   This doctrine involves nothing out of analogy with the ordinary
   operations of God. We believe that He is everywhere present in the
   material world, and controls the operations of natural causes. We know
   that He causes the grass to grow, and gives rain and fruitful seasons.
   We believe that He exercises a like control over the minds of men,
   turning them as the rivers of water are turned. All religion, natural
   and revealed, is founded on the assumption of this providential
   government of God. Besides this, we believe in the gracious operations
   of his Spirit, by which He works in the hearts of his people to will
   and to do; we believe that faith, repentance, and holy living are due
   to the ever-present influence of the Holy Spirit. If, then, this
   wonder-working God everywhere operates in nature and in grace, why
   should it be deemed incredible that holy men should speak as they were
   moved by the Holy Ghost, so that they should say just what He would
   have them say, so that their words should be his words.

   After all Christ is the great object of the Christian's faith. We
   believe him and we believe everything else on his authority. He hands
   us the Old Testament and tells us that it is the Word of God; that its
   authors spoke by the Spirit; that the Scriptures cannot be broken. And
   we believe on his testimony. His testimony to his Apostles is no less
   explicit, although given in a different way. He promised to give them a
   mouth and a wisdom which their adversaries could not gainsay or resist.
   He told them to take no thought what they should say, "For the Holy
   Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say." (Luke
   xii. 12.) "It is not ye that speak but the Spirit of your Father which
   speaketh in you." He said to them "he that receiveth you receiveth me";
   and He prayed for those who should believe on Him through their word.
   We believe the Scriptures, therefore, because Christ declares them to
   be the Word of God. Heaven and earth may pass away, but his word cannot
   pass away.

   I. Objections.

   A large class of the objections to the doctrine of inspiration, which
   for many minds are the most effective, arise from the rejection of one
   or other of the presumptions specified on a preceding page. If a man
   denies the existence of a personal, extramundane God, he must deny the
   doctrine of inspiration, but it is not necessary in order to prove that
   doctrine that we should first prove the being of God. If he denies that
   God exerts any direct efficiency in the government of the world, and
   holds that everything is the product of fixed laws, he cannot believe
   what the Scriptures teach of inspiration. If the supernatural be
   impossible, inspiration is impossible. It will be found that most of
   the objections, especially those of recent date, are founded on
   unscriptural views of the relation of God to the world, or on the
   peculiar philosophical views of the objectors as to the nature of man
   or of his free agency.

   A still larger class of objections is founded on misconceptions of the
   doctrine. Such objections are answered by the correct statement of what
   the Church believes on the subject. Even a man so distinguished for
   knowledge and ability as Coleridge, speaks with contempt of what he
   regards as the common theory of inspiration, when he utterly
   misunderstands the real doctrine which he opposes. He says: "All the
   miracles which the legends of monk or rabbi contain, can scarcely be
   put in competition, on the score of complication, inexplicableness, the
   absence of all intelligible use or purpose, and of circuitous
   self-frustration, with those that must be assumed by the maintainers of
   this doctrine, in order to give effect to the series of miracles by
   which all the nominal composers of the Hebrew nation before the time of
   Ezra, of whom there are any remains, were successively transformed into
   automaton compositors," [113] etc. But if the Church doctrine of
   inspiration no more assumes that the sacred writers "were transformed
   into automaton compositors," than that every believer is thus
   transformed in whom God "works to will and to do," then all such
   objections amount to nothing. If God, without interfering with a man's
   free agency, can make it infallibly certain that he will repent and
   believe, He can render it certain that he will not err in teaching. It
   is in vain to profess to hold the common doctrine of Theism, and yet
   assert that God cannot control rational creatures without turning them
   into machines.

   Discrepancies and Errors.

   But although the theologian may rightfully dismiss all objections
   founded in the denial of the common principles of natural and revealed
   religion, there are others which cannot be thus summarily disposed of.
   The most obvious of these is, that the sacred writers contradict each
   other, and that they teach error. It is, of course, useless to contend
   that the sacred writers were infallible, if in point of fact they err.
   Our views of inspiration must be determined by the phenomena of the
   Bible as well as from its didactic statements. If in fact the sacred
   writers retain each his own style and mode of thought, then we must
   renounce any theory which assumes that inspiration obliterates or
   suppresses all individual peculiarities. If the Scriptures abound in
   contradictions and errors, then it is vain to contend that they were
   written under an influence which precludes all error. The question,
   therefore, is a question of fact. Do the sacred writers contradict each
   other? Do the Scriptures teach what from any source can be proved not
   to be true? The question is not whether the views of the sacred writers
   were incorrect, but whether they taught error? For example, it is not
   the question Whether they thought that the earth is the centre of our
   system? but, Did they teach that it is?

   The objection under consideration, namely, that the Bible contains
   errors, divides itself into two. The first, that the sacred writers
   contradict themselves, or one the other. The second, that the Bible
   teaches what is inconsistent with the facts of history or science.

   As to the former of these objections, it would require, not a volume,
   but volumes to discuss all the cases of alleged discrepancies. All that
   can be expected here is a few general remarks: (1.) These apparent
   discrepancies, although numerous, are for the most part trivial;
   relating in most cases to numbers or dates. (2.) The great majority of
   them are only apparent, and yield to careful examination. (3.) Many of
   them may fairly be ascribed to errors of transcribers. (4.) The marvel
   and the miracle is that there are so few of any real importance.
   Considering that the different books of the Bible were written not only
   by different authors, but by men of all degrees of culture, living in
   the course of fifteen hundred or two thousand years, it is altogether
   unaccountable that they should agree perfectly, on any other hypothesis
   than that the writers were under the guidance of the Spirit of God. In
   this respect, as in all others, the Bible stands alone. It is enough to
   impress any mind with awe, when it contemplates the Sacred Scriptures
   filled with the highest truths, speaking with authority in the name of
   God, and so miraculously free from the soiling touch of human fingers.
   The errors in matters of fact which skeptics search out bear no
   proportion to the whole. No sane man would deny that the Parthenon was
   built of marble, even if here and there a speck of sandstone should be
   detected in its structure. Not less unreasonable is it to deny the
   inspiration of such a book as the Bible, because one sacred writer says
   that on a given occasion twenty-four thousand, and another says that
   twenty-three thousand, men were slain. Surely a Christian may be
   allowed to tread such objections under his feet.

   Admitting that the Scriptures do contain, in a few instances,
   discrepancies which with our present means of knowledge, we are unable
   satisfactorily to explain, they furnish no rational ground for denying
   their infallibility. "The Scripture cannot be broken." (John x. 35.)
   This is the whole doctrine of plenary inspiration, taught by the lips
   of Christ himself. The universe teems with evidences of design, so
   manifold, so diverse, so wonderful, as to overwhelm the mind with the
   conviction that it has had an intelligent author. Yet here and there
   isolated cases of monstrosity appear. It is irrational, because we
   cannot account for such cases, to deny that the universe is the product
   of intelligence. So the Christian need not renounce his faith in the
   plenary inspiration of the Bible, although there may be some things
   about it in its present state which he cannot account for.

   Historical and Scientific Objections.

   The second great objection to the plenary inspiration ot the Scripture
   is that it teaches what is inconsistent with historical and scientific
   truth.

   Here again it is to be remarked, (1.) That we must distinguish between
   what the sacred writers themselves thought or believed, and what they
   teach. They may have believed that the sun moves round the earth, but
   they do not so teach. (2.) The language of the Bible is the language of
   common life; and the language of common life is founded on apparent,
   and not upon scientific truth. It would be ridiculous to refuse to
   speak of the sun rising and setting, because we know that it is not a
   satellite of our planet. (3.) There is a great distinction between
   theories and facts. Theories are of men. Facts are of God. The Bible
   often contradicts the former, never the latter. (4.) There is also a
   distinction to be made between the Bible and our interpretation. The
   latter may come into competition with settled facts; and then it must
   yield. Science has in many things taught the Church how to understand
   the Scriptures. The Bible was for ages understood and explained
   according to the Ptolemaic system of the universe; it is now explained
   without doing the least violence to its language, according to the
   Copernican system. Christians have commonly believed that the earth has
   existed only a few thousands of years. If geologists finally prove that
   it has existed for myriads of ages, it will be found that the first
   chapter of Genesis is in full accord with the facts, and that the last
   results of science are embodied on the first page of the Bible. It may
   cost the Church a severe struggle to give up one interpretation and
   adopt another, as it did in the seventeenth century, but no real evil
   need be apprehended. The Bible has stood, and still stands in the
   presence of the whole scientific world with its claims unshaken. Men
   hostile or indifferent to its truths may, on insufficient grounds, or
   because of their personal opinions, reject its authority; but, even in
   the judgment of the greatest authorities in science, its teachings
   cannot fairly be impeached.

   It is impossible duly to estimate the importance of this subject. If
   the Bible be the word of God, all the great questions which for ages
   have agitated the minds of men are settled with infallible certainty.
   Human reason has never been able to answer to its own satisfaction, or
   to the assurance of others, the vital questions, What is God? What is
   man? What lies beyond the grave? If there be a future state of being,
   what is it? and How may future blessedness be secured? Without the
   Bible, we are, on all these subjects, in utter darkness. How endless
   and unsatisfying have been the answers to the greatest of all
   questions, What is God? The whole Eastern world answers by saying,
   "That He is the unconscious ground of being." The Greeks gave the same
   answer for philosophers, and made all nature God for the people. The
   moderns have reached no higher doctrine. Fichte says the subjective Ego
   is God. According to Schelling, God is the eternal movement of the
   universe, subject becoming object, object becoming subject, the
   infinite becoming finite, and the finite infinite. Hegel says, Thought
   is God. Cousin combines all the German answers to form his own.
   Coleridge refers us to Schelling for an answer to the question, What is
   God? Carlyle makes force God. A Christian child says: "God is a Spirit,
   infinite, eternal, and unchangeable in his being, wisdom, power,
   holiness, justice, goodness, and truth." Men and angels veil their
   faces in the presence of that answer. It is the highest, greatest, and
   most fruitful truth ever embodied in human language. Without the Bible,
   we are without God and without hope. The present is a burden, and the
   future a dread.

   § 3. Adverse Theories.

   Although substantial unanimity as to the doctrine of inspiration has
   prevailed among the great historical Churches of Christendom, yet there
   has been no little diversity of opinion among theologians and
   philosophical writers. The theories are too numerous to be examined in
   detail. They may, perhaps, be advantageously referred to the following
   classes.

   A. Naturalistic Doctrine.

   There is a large class of writers who deny any supernatural agency in
   the affairs of men. This general class includes writers who differ
   essentially in their views.

   First. There are those who, although Theists, hold the mechanical
   theory of the universe. That is, they hold that God having created the
   world, including all that it contains, organic and inorganic, rational
   and irrational, and having endowed matter with its properties and minds
   with their attributes, leaves it to itself. Just as a ship, when
   launched and equipped, is left to the winds and to its crew. This
   theory precludes the possibility not only of all miracles, prophecy,
   and supernatural revelation, but even of all providential government,
   whether general or special. Those who adopt this view of the relation
   of God to the world, must regard the Bible from beginning to end as a
   purely human production. They may rank it as the highest, or as among
   the lowest of the literary works of men; there is no possibility of its
   being inspired in any authorized sense of that word.

   Secondly. There are those who do not so entirely banish God from his
   works. They admit that He is everywhere present, and everywhere active;
   that his providential efficiency and control are exercised in the
   occurrence of all events. But they maintain that He always acts
   according to fixed laws; and always in connection and cooperation with
   second causes. According to this theory also, all miracles and all
   prophecy, properly speaking, are excluded. A revelation is admitted, or
   at least, is possible. But it is merely providential. It consists in
   such an ordering of circumstances, and such a combination of influences
   as to secure the elevation of certain men to a higher level of
   religious knowledge than that attained by others. They may also, in a
   sense, be said to be inspired in so far as that inward, subjective
   state is purer, and more devout, as well as more intelligent than that
   of ordinary men. There is no specific difference, however, according to
   this theory, between inspired and uninspired men. It is only a matter
   of degrees. One is more and another less purified and enlightened. This
   theory also makes the Bible a purely human production. It confines
   revelation to the sphere of human knowledge. No possible degree of
   culture or development can get anything more than human out of man.
   According to the Scriptures, and to the faith of the Church, the Bible
   is a revelation of the things of God; of his thoughts and purposes. But
   who knoweth the things of God, asks the Apostle, but the Spirit of God?
   The things which the Bible purports to make known, are precisely those
   things which lie beyond the ken of the human mind. This theory,
   therefore, for bread gives us a stone; for the thoughts of God, the
   thoughts of man.

   Schleiermacher's Theory.

   Thirdly. There is a theory far more pretentious and philosophical, and
   which of late years has widely prevailed, which in reality differs very
   little from the preceding. It agrees with it in the main point in that
   it denies anything supernatural in the origin or composition of the
   Bible. Schleiermacher, the author of this theory, was addicted to a
   philosophy which precluded all intervention of the immediate efficiency
   of God in the world. He admits, however, of two exceptions: the
   creation of man, and the constitution of the person of Christ. There
   was a supernatural intervention in the origin of our race, and in the
   manifestation of Christ. All else in the history of the world is
   natural. Of course there is nothing supernatural in the Bible; nothing
   in the Old Testament which the Adamic nature was not adequate to
   produce; and nothing in the New Testament, which Christianity, the life
   of the Church, a life common to all believers, is not sufficient to
   account for.

   Religion consists in feeling, and specifically in a feeling or absolute
   dependence (or an absolute feeling of dependence) i.e., the
   consciousness that the finite is nothing in the presence of the
   Infinite, -- the individual in the presence of the universal. This
   consciousness involves the unity of the one and all, of God and man.
   "This system," says Dr. Ulmann, one of its more moderate and effective
   advocates, "is not absolutely new. We find it in another form in
   ancient Mysticism, especially in the German Mystics of the Middle Ages.
   Within them, too, the ground and central point of Christianity is the
   oneness of Deity and humanity effected through the incarnation of God,
   and deification of man." [114]

   Christianity, therefore, is not a system of doctrine; it is not,
   subjectively considered, a form of knowledge. It is a life. It is the
   life of Christ. Ullmann again says explicitly: "The life of Christ is
   Christianity." [115] God in becoming man did not take upon himself, "a
   true body and a reasonable soul," but generic humanity; i.e., humanity
   as a generic life. The effect of the incarnation was to unite the human
   and divine as one life. And this life passes over to the Church
   precisely as the life of Adam passed over to his descendants, by a
   process of natural development. And this life is Christianity.
   Participation of this divine-human life makes a man a Christian.

   The Christian revelation consists in the providential dispensations
   connected within the appearance of Christ on the earth. The effect of
   these dispensations and events was the elevation of the religious
   consciousness of the men of that generation, and specially of those who
   came most directly under the influence of Christ. This subjective
   state, this excitement and elevation of their religious life, gave them
   intuitions of religious truths, "eternal verities." These intuitions
   were by the logical understanding clothed in the form of doctrines.
   This, however, was a gradual process as it was effected only by the
   Church-life, i.e., by the working of the new divine-human life in the
   body of believers. [116] Mr. Mormell in expounding this theory, says:
   [117] "The essential germ of the religious life is concentrated in the
   absolute feeling of dependence, -- a feeling which implies nothing
   abject, but, on the contrary, a high and hallowed sense of our being
   inseparably related to Deity." On the preceding page he had said, "Let
   the subject become as nothing -- not, indeed, from its intrinsic
   insignificance or incapacity of moral action, but by virtue of the
   infinity of the object to which it stands consciously opposed; and the
   feeling of dependence must become absolute; for all finite power is as
   nothing in relation to the Infinite."

   Christianity, as just stated, is the life of Christ, his human life,
   which is also divine, and is communicated to us as the life of Adam was
   communicated to his descendants. Morell, rather more in accordance with
   English modes of thought, says, [118] "Christianity, like every other
   religion, consists essentially in a state of man's inner consciousness,
   which develops itself into a system of thought and activity only in a
   community of awakened minds; and it was inevitable, therefore, that
   such a state of consciousness should require time, and intercourse, and
   mutual sympathy, before it could become moulded into a decided and
   distinctive form." He represents the Apostles as often meeting together
   and deliberating on essential points, correcting each other's views;
   and, after years of such fellowship, Christianity was at last brought
   into form.

   Revelation is declared to be a communication of truth to our
   intuitional consciousness. The outward world is a revelation to our
   sense-intuitions; beauty is a revelation to our esthetic intuitions;
   and "eternal verities," when intuitively perceived, are said to be
   revealed; and this intuition is brought about by whatever purifies and
   exalts our religious feelings. "Revelation," says Morell, "is a process
   of the intuitional consciousness, gazing upon eternal verities; while
   theology is the reflection of the understanding upon those vital
   intuitions, so as to reduce them to a logical and scientific
   expression." [119]

   Inspiration is the inward state of mind which enables us to apprehend
   the truth. "Revelation and inspiration," says Morell, "indicate one
   united process, the result of which upon the human mind is, to produce
   a state of spiritual intuition, whose phenomena are so extraordinary,
   that we at once separate the agency by which they are produced from any
   of the ordinary principles of human development. And yet this agency is
   applied in perfect consistency with the laws and natural operations of
   our spiritual nature. Inspiration does not imply anything generically
   new in the actual processes of the human mind; it does not involve any
   form of intelligence essentially different from what we already
   possess; it indicates rather the elevation of the religious
   consciousness, and with it, of course, the power of spiritual vision,
   to a degree of intensity peculiar to the individuals thus highly
   favoured of God." [120] The only difference, therefore, between the
   Apostles and ordinary Christians is as to their relative holiness.

   According to this theory there is no specific difference between genius
   and inspiration. The difference is simply in the objects apprehended
   and the causes of the inward excitement to which the apprehension is
   due. "Genius," says Morell, "consists in the possession of a remarkable
   power of intuition with reference to some particular object, a power
   which arises from the inward nature of a man being brought into unusual
   harmony with that object in its reality and its operations." [121] This
   is precisely his account of inspiration. "Let," he says, "there be a
   due purification of the moral nature, -- a perfect harmony of the
   spiritual being with the mind of God, -- a removal of all inward
   disturbances from the heart, and what is to prevent or disturb this
   immediate intuition of divine things." [122]

   This theory of inspiration, while retaining its essential elements, is
   variously modified. With those who believe with Schleiermacher, that
   man "is the form in which God comes to conscious existence on our
   earth," it has one form. With Realists who define man to be "the
   manifestation of generic humanity in connection with a given corporeal
   organization;" and who believe that it was generic humanity which
   Christ took and united in one life with his divine nature, which life
   is communicated to the Church as his body, and thereby to all its
   members; it takes a somewhat different form. With those again who do
   not adopt either of these anthropological theories, but take the common
   view as to the constitution of man; it takes still a different, and in
   some respects, a lower, form. In all, however, inspiration is the
   intuition of divine truths due to the excitement of the religious
   nature, whatever that nature may be.

   Objections to Schleiermacher's Theory.

   To this theory in all its forms it may be objected, -- 1. That it
   proceeds upon a wrong view of religion in general and of Christianity
   in particular. It assumes that religion is a feeling, a life. It denies
   that it is a form of knowledge, or involves the reception of any
   particular system of doctrine. In the subjective sense of the word, all
   religions (i.e., all religious doctrines) are true, as Twesten says,
   [123] but all are not equally pure, or equally adequate expressions of
   the inward religious principle. According to the Scriptures, however,
   and the common conviction of Christians, religion (subjectively
   considered) is the reception of certain doctrines as true, and a state
   of heart and course of action in accordance with those doctrines. The
   Apostles propounded a certain system of doctrines; they pronounced
   those to be Christians who received those doctrines so as to determine
   their character and life. They pronounced those who rejected those
   doctrines, who refused to receive their testimony, as antichristian; as
   having no part or lot with the people of God. Christ's command was to
   teach; to convert the world by teaching. On this principle the Apostles
   acted and the Church has ever acted from that day to this. Those who
   deny Theism as a doctrine, are atheists. Those who reject Christianity
   as a system of doctrine, are unbelievers. They are not Christians. The
   Bible everywhere assumes that without truth there can be no holiness;
   that all conscious exercises of spiritual life are in view of truth
   objectively revealed in the Scriptures. And hence the importance
   everywhere attributed to knowledge, to truth, to sound doctrine, in the
   Word of God.

   2. This theory is inconsistent with the Scriptural doctrine of
   revelation. According to the Bible, God presents truth objectively to
   the mind, whether by audible words, by visions, or by the immediate
   operations of his Spirit. According to this theory, revelation is
   merely the providential ordering of circumstances which awaken and
   exalt the religious feelings, and which thus enable the mind
   intuitively to apprehend the things of God.

   3. It avowedly confines these intuitions, and of course revealed truth,
   to what are called "eternal verities." But the great body of truths
   revealed in Scripture are not "eternal verities." The fall of man; that
   all men are sinners; that the Redeemer from sin was to be of the seed
   of Abraham, and of the house of David; that He was to be born of a
   virgin, to be a man of sorrows; that He was crucified and buried; that
   He rose again the third day; that He ascended to heaven; that He is to
   come again without sin to salvation, although truths on which our
   salvation depends, are not intuitive truths; they are not truths which
   any exaltation of the religious consciousness would enable any man to
   discover of himself.

   4. According to this theory the Bible has no normal authority as a rule
   of faith. It contains no doctrines revealed by God, and to be received
   as true on his testimony. It contains only the thoughts of holy men;
   the forms in which their understandings, without supernatural aid,
   clothed the "intuitions" due to their religious feelings. "The Bible,"
   says Morell, [124] "cannot in strict accuracy of language be termed a
   revelation, since a revelation always implies an actual process of
   intelligence in a living mind; but it contains the records in which
   those minds who enjoyed the preliminary training or the first brighter
   revelatior of Christianity, have described the scenes which awakened
   their own religious nature to new life, and the high ideas and
   aspirations to which that new life gave origin." The Old Testament is
   the product of "the religious consciousness of men who lived under a
   rude state of culture; and is of no authority for us. The New Testament
   is the product of "the religious consciousness of men who had
   experienced the sanctifying influence of Christ's presence among them.
   But those men were Jews, they had Jewish modes of thinking. They were
   familiar with the services of the old dispensation, were accustomed to
   think of God as approachable only through a priesthood; as demanding
   expiation for sin, and regeneration of heart; and promising certain
   rewards and forms of blessedness in a future state of existence. It was
   natural for them, therefore, to clothe their "intuitions" in these
   Jewish modes of thought. We, in this nineteenth century, may clothe
   ours in very different forms, i.e., in very different doctrines, and
   yet "the eternal verities" be the same.

   Different men carry this theory to very different lengths. Some have
   such an inward experience that they can find no form for expressing
   what they feel, so suitable as that given in the Bible, and therefore
   they believe all its great doctrines. But the ground of their faith is
   purely subjective. It is not the testimony of God given in his Word,
   but their own experience. They take what suits that, and reject the
   rest. Others with less Christian experience, or with no experience
   distinctively Christian, reject all the distinctive doctrines of
   Christianity, and adopt a form of religious philosophy which they are
   willing to call Christianity.

   5. That this theory is antiscriptural has already been said. The Bible
   makes revelation as therein contained to be the communication of
   doctrines to the understanding by the Spirit of God. It makes those
   truths or doctrines the immediate source of all right feeling. The
   feelings come from spiritual apprehension of the truth, and not the
   knowledge of truth from the feeling. Knowledge is necessary to all
   conscious holy exercises. Hence the Bible makes truth of the greatest
   importance. It pronounces those blessed who receive the doctrines which
   it teaches, and those accursed who reject them. It makes the salvation
   of men to depend upon their faith. This theory makes the creed of a man
   or of a people of comparatively little consequence.

   In the Church, therefore, Christianity has always been regarded as a
   system of doctrine. Those who believe these doctrines are Christians;
   those who reject them, are, in the judgment of the Church, infidels or
   heretics. If our faith be formal or speculative, so is our
   Christianity; if it be spiritual and living, so is our religion. But no
   mistake can be greater than to divorce religion from truth, and make
   Christianity a spirit or life distinct from the doctrines which the
   Scriptures present as the objects of faith.

   B. Gracious Inspiration.

   This theory belongs to the category of natural or supernatural,
   according to the meaning assigned to those terms. By natural effects
   are commonly understood those brought about by natural causes under the
   providential control of God. Then the effects produced by the gracious
   operations of the Spirit, such as repentance, faith, love, and all
   other fruits of the Spirit, are supernatural. And consequently the
   theory which refers inspiration to the gracious influence of the
   Spirit, belongs to the class of the supernatural. But this word is
   often used in a more limited sense, to designate events which are
   produced by the immediate agency or volition of God without the
   intervention of any second cause. In this limited sense, creation,
   miracles, immediate revelation, regeneration (in the limited sense of
   that word), are supernatural. As the sanctification of men is carried
   on by the Spirit by the use of the means of grace, it is not a
   supernatural work, in the restricted sense of the term.

   There are many theologians who do not adopt either of the philosophical
   theories of the nature of man and of his relation to God, above
   mentioned; and who receive the Scriptural doctrine as held by the
   Church universal, that the Holy Spirit renews, sanctifies, illuminates,
   guides, and teaches all the people of God; and yet who regard
   inspiration to be one of the ordinary fruits of the Spirit. Inspired
   and uninspired men are not distinguished by any specific difference.
   The sacred writers were merely holy men under the guidance of the
   ordinary influence of the Spirit. Some of those who adopt this theory
   extend it to revelation as well as to inspiration. Others admit a
   strictly supernatural revelation, but deny that the sacred writers in
   communicating the truths revealed were under any influence not uncommon
   to ordinary believers. And as to those parts of the Bible (as the
   Hagiographa and Gospels), which contain no special revelations, they
   are to be regarded as the devotional writings or historical narratives
   of devout but fallible men. Thus Coleridge, who refers inspiration to
   that "grace and communion with the Spirit which the Church, under all
   circumstances, and every regenerate member of the Church, in permitted
   to hope and instructed to pray for;" makes an exception in favour of
   "the law and the prophets, no jot or tittle of which can pass
   unfulfilled." [125] The remainder of the Bible, he holds, was written
   under the impulse and guidance of the gracious influence of the Spirit
   given to all Christian men. And his friends and followers, Dr. Arnold,
   Archdeacon Hare, and specially Maurice, ignore this distinction and
   refer the whole Bible "to an inspiration the same as what every
   believer enjoys." [126] Thus Maurice says, [127] "We must forego the
   demand which we make on the conscience of young men, when we compel
   them to declare that they regard the inspiration of the Bible as
   generically unlike that which God bestows on His children in this day."

   Objections to the Doctrine that Inspiration is common to all Believers.

   That this theory is anti-scriptural is obvious. 1. Because the Bible
   makes a marked distinction between those whom God chose to be his
   messengers, his prophets, his spokesmen, and other men. This theory
   ignores that distinction, so far as the people of God is concerned.

   2. It is inconsistent with the authority claimed by these special
   messengers of God. They spoke in his name. God spoke through them. They
   said, "Thus saith the Lord," in a sense and way in which no ordinary
   believer dare use those words. It is inconsistent with the authority
   not only claimed by the sacred writers, but attributed to them by our
   Lord himself. He declared that the Scripture could not be broken, that
   it was infallible in all its teachings. The Apostles declare those
   anathema who did not receive their doctrines. This claim to divine
   authority in teaching was confirmed by God himself in signs, and
   wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost.

   3. It is inconsistent with the whole nature of the Bible, which is and
   professes to be a revelation of truths not only undiscoverable by human
   reason, but which no amount of holiness could enable the mind of man to
   perceive. This is true not only of the strictly prophetic revelations
   relating to the future, but also of all things, concerning the mind and
   will of God. The doctrines of the Bible are called musteria, things
   concealed, unknown and unknowable, except as revealed to the holy
   Apostles and prophets by the Spirit. (Eph. iii. 5.)

   4. It is inconsistent with the faith of the Church universal, which has
   always made the broadest distinction between the writings of the
   inspired men and those of ordinary believers. Even Romanists, with all
   their reverence for the fathers, never presumed to place their writings
   on a level with the Scriptures. They do not attribute to them any
   authority but as witnesses of what the Apostles taught. If the Bible
   has no more authority than is due to the writings of pious men, then
   our faith is vain and we are yet in our sins. We have no sure
   foundation for our hopes of salvation.

   C. Partial Inspiration.

   Under this head are included several different doctrines.

   1. Many hold that only some parts of Scripture are inspired, i.e., that
   the writers of some books were supernaturally guided by the Spirit, and
   the writers of others were not. This, as mentioned above, was the
   doctrine of Coleridge, who admitted the inspiration of the Law and the
   Prophets, but denied that of the rest of the Bible. Others admit the
   New Testament to be inspired to an extent to which the Old was not.
   Others again hold the discourses of Christ to be infallible, but no
   other part of the sacred volume.

   2. Others limit the inspiration of the sacred writers to their
   doctrinal teaching. The great object of their commission was to give a
   faithful record of the revealed will and purpose of God, to be a rule
   of faith and practice to the Church. In this they were under an
   influence which rendered them infallible as religious and moral
   teachers. But beyond these limits they were as liable to error as other
   men. That there should be scientific, historical, geographical
   mistakes; errors in the citation of passages, or in other unessential
   matters; or discrepancies as to matters of fact between the sacred
   writers, leaves their inspiration as religious teachers untouched.

   3. Another form of the doctrine of partial, as opposed to plenary
   inspiration, limits it to the thoughts, as distinguished from the words
   of Scripture. Verbal inspiration is denied. It is assumed that the
   sacred writers selected the words they used without any guidance of the
   Spirit, to prevent their adopting improper or inadequate terms in which
   to express their thoughts.

   4. A fourth form of the doctrine of partial inspiration was early
   introduced and has been widely adopted. Maimonides, the greatest of the
   Jewish doctors since the time of Christ, taught as early as the twelfth
   century that the sacred writers of the Old Testament enjoyed different
   degrees of divine guidance. He placed the inspiration of the Law much
   above that of the Prophets; and that of the Prophets higher than that
   of the Hagiographa. His idea of different degrees of inspiration was
   adopted by many theologians, and in England for a long time it was the
   common mode of representation. The idea was that the writers of Kings
   and Chronicles needed less, and that they received less of the divine
   assistance than Isaiah or St. John. [128]

   In attempting to prove the doctrine of plenary inspiration the
   arguments which bear against all these forms of partial inspiration
   were given or suggested. The question is not an open one. It is not
   what theory is in itself most reasonable or plausible, but simply, What
   does the Bible teach on the subject? If our Lord and his Apostles
   declare the Old Testament to be the Word of God; that its authors spake
   as they were moved by the Holy Ghost; that what they said, the Spirit
   said; if they refer to the facts and to the very words of Scripture as
   of divine authority; and if the same infallible divine guidance was
   promised to the writers of the New Testament, and claimed by
   themselves; and if their claim was authenticated by God himself: then
   there is no room for, as there is no need of, these theories of partial
   inspiration. The whole Bible was written under such an influence as
   preserved its human authors from all error, and makes it for the Church
   the infallible rule of faith and practice.

   § 4. The Completeness of the Scriptures.

   By the completeness of the Scriptures is meant that they contain all
   the extant revelations of God designed to be a rule of faith and
   practice to the Church. It is not denied that God reveals himself, even
   his eternal power and Godhead, by his works, and has done so from the
   beginning of the world. But all the truths thus revealed are clearly
   made known in his written Word. Nor is it denied that there may have
   been, and probably were, books written by inspired men, which are no
   longer in existence. Much less is it denied that Christ and his
   Apostles delivered many discourses which were not recorded, and which,
   could they now be known and authenticated, would be of equal authority
   with the books now regarded as canonical. All that Protestants insist
   upon is, that the Bible contains all the extant revelations of God,
   which He designed to be the rule of faith and practice for his Church;
   so that nothing can rightfully be imposed on the consciences of men as
   truth or duty which is not taught directly or by necessary implication
   in the Holy Scriptures. This excludes all unwritten traditions, not
   only, but also all decrees of the visible Church; all resolutions of
   conventions, or other public bodies, declaring this or that to be right
   or wrong, true or false. The people of God are bound by nothing but the
   Word of God. On this subject little need be said. The completeness of
   Scripture, as a rule of faith, is a corollary of the Protestant
   doctrine concerning tradition. If that be true, the former must also be
   true. This Romanists do not deny. They make the Rule of Faith to
   consist of the written and unwritten word of God, i.e., of Scripture
   and tradition. If it be proved that tradition is untrustworthy, human,
   and fallible, then the Scriptures by common consent stand alone in
   their authority. As the authority of tradition has already been
   discussed, further discussion of the completeness of the Scriptures
   becomes unnecessary.

   It is well, however, to bear in mind the importance of this doctrine.
   It is not by Romanists only that it is denied, practically at least, if
   not theoretically. Nothing is more common among Protestants, especially
   in our day, than the attempt to coerce the conscience of men by public
   opinion; to make the opinions of men on questions of morals a rule of
   duty for the people, and even for the Church. If we would stand fast in
   the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, we must adhere to the
   principle that in matters of religion and morals the Scriptures alone
   have authority to bind the conscience.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 5. Perspicuity of the Scriptures. The Right of Private Judgment.

   The Bible is a plain book. It is intelligible by the people. And they
   have the right, and are bound to read and interpret it for themselves;
   so that their faith may rest on the testimony of the Scriptures, and
   not on that of the Church. Such is the doctrine of Protestants on this
   subject.

   It is not denied that the Scriptures contain many things hard to be
   understood; that they require diligent study; that all men need the
   guidance of the Holy Spirit in order to right knowledge and true faith.
   But it is maintained that in all things necessary to salvation they are
   sufficiently plain to be understood even by the unlearned.

   It is not denied that the people, learned and unlearned, in order to
   the proper understanding of the Scriptures, should not only compare
   Scripture with Scripture, and avail themselves of all the means in
   their power to aid them in their search after the truth, but they
   should also pay the greatest deference to the faith of the Church. If
   the Scriptures be a plain book, and the Spirit performs the functions
   of a teacher to all the children of God, it follows inevitably that
   they must agree in all essential matters in their interpretation of the
   Bible. And from that fact it follows that for an individual Christian
   to dissent from the faith of the universal Church (i.e., the body of
   true believers), is tantamount to dissenting from the Scriptures
   themselves.

   What Protestants deny on this subject is, that Christ has appointed any
   officer, or class of officers, in his Church to whose interpretation of
   the Scriptures the people are bound to submit as of final authority.
   What they affirm is that He has made it obligatory upon every man to
   search the Scriptures for himself, and determine on his own discretion
   what they require him to believe and to do.

   The arguments in support of the former of these positions have already
   been presented in the discussion concerning the infallibility of the
   Church. The most obvious reasons in support of the right of private
   judgment are, --

   1. That the obligations to faith and obedience are personal. Every man
   is responsible for his religious faith and his moral conduct. He cannot
   transfer that responsibility to others; nor can others assume it in his
   stead. He must answer for himself; and if he must answer for himself,
   he must judge for himself. It will not avail him in the day of judgment
   to say that his parents or his Church taught him wrong. He should have
   listened to God, and obeyed Him rather than men.

   2. The Scriptures are everywhere addressed to the people, and not to
   the officers of the Church either exclusively, or specially. The
   prophets were sent to the people, and constantly said, "Hear, O
   Israel," "Hearken, O ye people." Thus, also, the discourses of Christ
   were addressed to the people, and the people heard him gladly. All the
   Epistles of the New Testament are addressed to the congregation, to the
   "called of Jesus Christ;" "to the beloved of God;" to those "called to
   be saints;" "to the sanctified in Christ Jesus;" "to all who call on
   the name of Jesus Christ our Lord;" "to the saints which are in
   (Ephesus), and to the faithful in Jesus Christ;" or "to the saints and
   faithful brethren which are in (Colosse);" and so in every instance. It
   is the people who are addressed. To them are directed these profound
   discussions of Christian doctrine, and these comprehensive expositions
   of Christian duty. They are everywhere assumed to be competent to
   understand what is written, and are everywhere required to believe and
   obey what thus came from the inspired messengers of Christ. They were
   not referred to any other authority from which they were to learn the
   true import of these inspired instructions. It is, therefore, not only
   to deprive the people of a divine right, to forbid the people to read
   and interpret the Scriptures for themselves; but it is also to
   interpose between them and God, and to prevent their hearing his voice,
   that they may listen to the words of men.

   The People commanded to search the Scriptures.

   3. The Scriptures are not only addressed to the people, but the people
   were called upon to study them, and to teach them unto their children.
   It was one of the most frequently recurring injunctions to parents
   under the old dispensation, to teach the Law unto their children, that
   they again might teach it unto theirs. The "holy oracles" were
   committed to the people, to be taught by the people; and taught
   immediately out of the Scriptures, that the truth might be retained in
   its purity. Thus our Lord commanded the people to search the
   Scriptures, saying, "They are they which testify of me." (John v. 39.)
   He assumed that they were able to understand what the Old Testament
   said of the Messiah, although its teachings had been misunderstood by
   the scribes and elders, and by the whole Sanhedrim. Paul rejoiced that
   Timothy had from his youth known the Holy Scriptures, which were able
   to make him wise unto salvation. He said to the Galatians (i. 8, 9),
   "Though we, or an angel from heaven, -- if any man preach any other
   gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed." This
   implies two things, -- first, that the Galatian Christians, the people,
   had a right to sit in judgment on the teaching of an Apostle, or of an
   angel from heaven; and secondly, that they had an infallible rule by
   which that judgment was to be determined, namely, a previous
   authenticated revelation of God. If, then, the Bible recognizes the
   right of the people to judge of the teaching of Apostles and angels,
   they are not to be denied the right of judging of the doctrines of
   bishops and priests. The principle laid down by the Apostle is
   precisely that long before given by Moses (Deut. xiii. 1-3), who tells
   the people that if a prophet should arise, although he worked wonders,
   they were not to believe or obey him, if he taught them anything
   contrary to the Word of God. This again assumes right to judge, and
   that the people had the ability and the right to judge, and that they
   had an infallible rule of judgment. It implies, moreover, that their
   salvation depended upon their judging rightly. For if they allowed
   these false teachers, robed in sacred vestments, and surrounded by the
   insignia of authority, to lead them from the truth, they would
   inevitably perish.

   4. It need hardly be remarked that this right of private judgment is
   the great safeguard of civil and religious liberty. If the Bible be
   admitted to be the infallible rule of faith and practice in accordance
   with which men are bound on the peril of their souls, to frame their
   creed and conduct; and if there be a set of men who have the exclusive
   right of interpreting the Scripture, and who are authorized to impose
   their interpretations on the people as of divine authority, then they
   may impose on them what conditions of salvation they see fit. And the
   men who have the salvation of the people in their hands are their
   absolute masters. Both reason and experience fully sustain the dictum
   of Chillingworth, [129] when he says, "He that would usurp an absolute
   lordship and tyranny over any people, need not put himself to the
   trouble and difficulty of abrogating and disannulling the laws, made to
   maintain the common liberty; for he may frustrate their intent, and
   compass his own design as well, if he can get the power and authority
   to interpret them as he pleases, and add to them what he pleases, and
   to have his interpretations and additions stand for laws; if he can
   rule his by his lawyers." This is precisely what the Church of Rome has
   done, and thereby established a tyranny for which there is no parallel
   in the history of the world. What renders this tyranny the more
   intolerable, is, that, so far as the mass of the people is concerned,
   it resolves itself into the authority of the parish priest. He is the
   arbiter of the faith and morals of his people. No man can believe
   unless the ground of faith is present to his mind. If the people are to
   believe that the Scriptures teach certain doctrines, then they must
   have the evidence that such doctrines are really taught in the Bible.
   If that evidence be that the Church so interprets the sacred writings,
   then the people must know what is the Church, i.e., which of the bodies
   claiming to be the Church, is entitled to be so regarded. How are the
   people, the uneducated masses, to determine that question? The priest
   tells them. If they receive his testimony on that point, then how can
   they tell how the Church interprets the Scriptures? Here again they
   must take the word of the priest. Thus the authority of the Church as
   an interpreter, which appears so imposing, resolves itself into the
   testimony of the priest, who is often wicked, and still oftener
   ignorant. This cannot be the foundation of the faith of God's elect.
   That foundation is the testimony of God himself speaking his word, and
   authenticated as divine by the testimony of the Spirit with and by the
   truth in the heart of the believer.

   § 6. Rules of interpretation.

   If every man has the right, and is bound to read the Scriptures, and to
   judge for himself what they teach, he must have certain rules to guide
   him in the exercise of this privilege and duty. These rules are not
   arbitrary. They are not imposed by human authority. They have no
   binding force which does not flow from their own intrinsic truth and
   propriety. They are few and simple.

   1. The words of Scripture are to be taken in their plain historical
   sense. That is, they must be taken in the sense attached to them in the
   age and by the people to whom they were addressed. This only assumes
   that the sacred writers were honest, and meant to be understood.

   2. If the Scriptures be what they claim to be, the word of God, they
   are the work of one mind, and that mind divine. From this it follows
   that Scripture cannot contradict Scripture. God cannot teach in one
   place anything which is inconsistent with what He teaches in another.
   Hence Scripture must explain Scripture. If a passage admits of
   different interpretations, that only can be the true one which agrees
   with what the Bible teaches elsewhere on the same subject. If the
   Scriptures teach that the Son is the same in substance and equal in
   power and glory with the Father, then when the Son says, "The Father is
   greater than I," the superiority must be understood in a manner
   consistent with this equality. It must refer either to subordination as
   to the mode of subsistence and operation, or it must be official. A
   king's son may say, "My father is greater than I," although personally
   his father's equal. This rule of interpretation is sometimes called the
   analogy of Scripture, and sometimes the analogy of faith. There is no
   material difference in the meaning of the two expressions.

   3. The Scriptures are to be interpreted under the guidance of the Holy
   Spirit, which guidance is to be humbly and earnestly sought. The ground
   of this rule is twofold: First, the Spirit is promised as a guide and
   teacher. He was to come to lead the people of God into the knowledge of
   the truth. And secondly, the Scriptures teach, that "the natural man
   receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness
   unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
   discerned." (1 Cor. ii. 14.) The unrenewed mind is naturally blind to
   spiritual truth. His heart is in opposition to the things of God.
   Congeniality of mind is necessary to the proper apprehension of divine
   things. As only those who have a moral nature can discern moral truth,
   so those only who are spiritually minded can truly receive the things
   of the Spirit.

   The fact that all the true people of God in every age and in every part
   of the Church, in the exercise of their private judgment, in accordance
   with the simple rules above stated, agree as to the meaning of
   Scripture in all things necessary either in faith or practice, is a
   decisive proof of the perspicuity of the Bible, and of the safety of
   allowing the people the enjoyment of the divine right of private
   judgment.

CHAPTER I.

  ORIGIN OF THE IDEA OF GOD.

   All men have some knowledge of God. That is, they have the conviction
   that there is a Being on whom they are dependent, and to whom they are
   responsible. What is the source of this conviction? In other words,
   what is the origin of the idea of God? To this question three answers
   have been given. First, that it is innate. Second, that is a deduction
   of reason; a conclusion arrived at by a process of generalization.
   Third, that it is to be referred to a supernatural revelation,
   preserved by tradition.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. The Knowledge of God is Innate.

   A. What is meant by Innate Knowledge.

   By innate knowledge is meant that which is due to our constitution, as
   sentient, rational, and moral beings. It is opposed to knowledge
   founded on experience; to that obtained by ab extra instruction; and to
   that acquired by a process of research and reasoning.

   It cannot be doubted that there is such knowledge, i.e., that the soul
   is so constituted that it sees certain things to be true immediately in
   their own light. They need no proof. Men need not be told or taught
   that the things thus perceived are true. These immediate perceptions
   are called intuitions, primary truths, laws of belief, innate
   knowledge, or ideas. Provided we understand what is meant, the
   designation is of minor importance. The doctrine of innate knowledge,
   or intuitive truths, does not imply that the child is born with
   knowledge in conscious exercise in the mind. As knowledge is a form or
   state of the intelligence, and as that is a state of consciousness,
   knowledge, in the sense of the act of knowing, must be a matter of
   consciousness; and, therefore, it is said, cannot be innate. The
   new-born child has no conscious conviction of the existence of God. But
   the word knowledge is sometimes used in a passive sense. A man knows
   what lies dormant in his mind. Most of our knowledge is in that state.
   All the facts of history stored in the memory, are out of the domain of
   consciousness, until the mind is turned to them. It is not
   inconceivable, therefore, that the soul as it comes into the world may
   be stored with these primary truths which lie dormant in the mind,
   until roused by the due occasion. This, however, is not what is meant
   by innate knowledge. The word innate simply indicates the source of the
   knowledge. That source is our nature; that which is born with us. Nor
   does the doctrine of innate knowledge imply that the mind is born with
   ideas, in the sense of "patterns, phantasms, or notions," as Locke
   calls them; nor that it is furnished by nature with a set of abstract
   principles, or general truths. All that is meant is, that the mind is
   so constituted that it perceives certain things to be true without
   proof and without instruction.

   These intuitive truths belong to the several departments of the senses,
   the understanding, and our moral nature. In the first place, all our
   sense perceptions are intuitions. We apprehend their objects
   immediately, and have an irresistible conviction of their reality and
   truth. We may draw erroneous conclusions from our sensations; but our
   sensations, as far as they go, tell us the truth. When a man feels
   pain, he may refer it to the wrong place, or to a wrong cause; but he
   knows that it is pain. If he sees an object, he may be mistaken as to
   its nature; but he knows that he sees, and that what he sees is the
   cause of the sensation which he experiences. These are intuitions,
   because they are immediate perceptions of what is true. The conviction
   which attends our sensations is due not to instruction but to the
   constitution of our nature.

   In the second place, there are intuitions of the intellect. That is,
   there are certain truths which the mind perceives to be true
   immediately, without proof or testimony. Such are the axioms of
   geometry. No man needs to have it proved to him that the part of a
   thing is less than the whole; or that a straight line is the shortest
   distance between two given points. It is an intuitive truth that
   "nothing" cannot be a cause; that every effect must have a cause. This
   conviction is not founded on experience, because experience is of
   necessity limited. And the conviction is not merely that every effect
   which we or other men have observed has had a cause; but that in the
   nature of things there can be no effect without an adequate cause. This
   conviction is said to be an innate truth, not because the child is born
   with it so that it is included in its infant consciousness, nor because
   the abstract principle is laid up in the mind, but simply because such
   is the nature of the mind, that it cannot but see these things to be
   true. As we are born with the sense of touch and sight, and take
   cognizance of their appropriate objects as soon as they are presented;
   so we are born with the intellectual faculty of perceiving these
   primary truths as soon as they are presented.

   In the third place, there are moral truths which the mind intuitively
   recognizes as true. The essential distinction between right and wrong;
   the obligation of virtue; responsibility for character and conduct;
   that sin deserves punishment; are examples of this class of truths. No
   man needs to be taught them. No one seeks for further evidence of their
   being truths than that which is found in their nature.

   There is another remark to be made in reference to the intuitions of
   the mind. The power of intuitional perception is capable of being
   increased. It is in fact greater in one man than in other men. The
   senses of some persons are far more acute than those of others. The
   senses of hearing and touch are greatly exalted in the case of the
   blind. It is the same with the intellect. What is self-evident to one
   man, has to be proved to another. It is said that all the propositions
   of the First Book of Euclid were as plain at first sight to Newton as
   the axioms. The same is true in our moral and religious nature. The
   more that nature is purified and exalted, the clearer is its vision,
   and the wider the scope of its intuitions. It is not easy to see,
   therefore, why Sir William Hamilton should make simplicity a
   characteristic of intuitive truths. If a proposition be capable of
   resolution into simpler factors, it may still to a powerful intellect
   be seen as self-evidently true. What is seen immediately, without the
   intervention of proof, to be true, is, according to the common mode of
   expression, said to be seen intuitively.

   It is, however, only of the lower exercises of this power that we can
   avail ourselves in our arguments with our fellow men. Because a truth
   may be self-evident to one mind, it does not follow that it must be so
   to all other minds. But there is a class of truths so plain that they
   never fail to reveal themselves to the human mind, and to which the
   mind cannot refuse its assent. Hence the criteria of those truths which
   are accepted as axioms, and which are assumed in all reasoning, and the
   denial of which renders all faith and all knowledge impossible, are
   universality and necessity. What all believe, and what all men must
   believe, is to be assumed as undeniably true. These criteria indeed
   include each other. If a truth be universally admitted, it must be
   because no man can rationally call it to question. And if it be a
   matter of necessary belief it must be accepted by all who possess the
   nature out of the constitution of which the necessity arises.

   B. Proof that the Knowledge of God is Innate.

   The question now is, Whether the existence of God is an intuitive
   truth? Is it given in the very constitution of our nature? Is it one of
   those truths which reveal themselves to every human mind, and to which
   the mind is forced to assent? In other words, has it the
   characteristics of universality and necessity? It should be remarked
   that when universality is made a criterion of intuitive truths, it is
   intended to apply to those truths only which have their foundation or
   evidence in the constitution of our nature. As to the external world,
   if ignorance be universal, error may be universal. All men, for
   example, for ages believed that the sun moves round the earth; but the
   universality of that belief was no evidence of its truth.

   When it is asked, Whether the existence of God is an intuitive truth,
   the question is equivalent to asking, Whether the belief in his
   existence is universal and necessary? If it be true that all men do
   believe there is a God, and that no man can possibly disbelieve his
   existence, then his existence is an intuitive truth. It is one of those
   given in the constitution of our nature; or which, our nature being
   what it is, no man can fail to know and to acknowledge.

   Such has been the common opinion in all ages. Cicero [130] says: "Esse
   Deos, quoniam insitas eorum, vel potius innatas cognitiones habemus."
   Tertullian [131] says of the heathen of his day, that the common people
   had a more correct idea of God than the phtilosophers. Calvin [132]
   says "Hoc quidem recte judicantibus semper constabit, insculptum
   mentibus humanis esse divinitatis sensum, qui deleri nunquam potest."
   The whole tendency in our day is, to make the existence of God so
   entirely a matter of intuition as to lead to the disparagement of all
   argument in proof of it. This extreme, however, does not justify the
   denial of a truth so important as that God has not left any human being
   without a knowledge of his existence and authority.

   The word God, however, is used in a very wide sense. In the Christian
   sense of the word, "God is a spirit, infinite, eternal, and
   unchangeable, in his being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness,
   and truth." This sublime idea of God no human mind ever attained either
   intuitively or discursively, except under the light of a supernatural
   revelation. On the other hand, some philosophers dignify motion, force,
   or the vague idea of the infinite, with the name of God. In neither of
   these senses of the word is the knowledge of God said to be innate, or
   a matter of intuition. It is in the general sense of a Being on whom we
   are dependent, and to whom we are responsible, that the idea is
   asserted to exist universally, and of necessity, in every human mind.
   It is true that if this idea is analyzed, it will be found to embrace
   the conviction that God is a person, and that He possesses moral
   attributes, and acts as a moral governor. Nothing is asserted as to how
   far this analysis is made by uneducated and uncivilized men. All that
   is maintained is that this sense of dependence and accountability to a
   being higher than themselves exists in the minds of all men.

   The Knowledge of God is Universal.

   In proof of this doctrine, reference may be made --

   1. To the testimony of Scripture. The Bible asserts that the knowledge
   of God is thus universal. This it does both directly and by necessary
   implication. The Apostle directly asserts in regard to the heathen as
   such without limitation, that they have the knowledge of God, and such
   knowledge as to render their impiety and immorality inexcusable.
   "Because that when they knew God," he says, "they glorified him not as
   God, neither were thankful." (Rom. i. 19-21.) He says of the most
   depraved of men, that they know the righteous judgment of God, that
   those who commit sin are worthy of death. (Rom. i. 32.) The Scripture
   everywhere addresses men as sinners; it calls upon them to repent; it
   threatens them with punishment in case of disobedience: or promises
   pardon to those who turn from their sins. All this is done without any
   preliminary demonstration of the being of God. It assumes that men know
   that there is a God, and that they are subject to his moral government.
   It is true that the Bible at times speaks of the heathen as not knowing
   God, and says that they are without God. But this, as explained by the
   context in which such declarations appear, and by the general teaching
   of the Scriptures, only means that the heathen are without correct, or
   saving knowledge of God; that they are without his favour, do not
   belong to the number of his people, and of course are not partakers of
   the blessedness of those whose God is the Lord. In teaching the
   universal sinfulness and condemnation of men: their inexcusableness for
   idolatry and immorality, and in asserting that even the most degraded
   are conscious of guilt and just exposure to the divine judgment, the
   Bible takes for granted that the knowledge of God is universal, that it
   is written on the heart of every man.

   This is still more apparent from what the Bible teaches of the law as
   written on the heart. The Apostle tells us that those who have a
   written revelation, shall be judged by that revelation; that those who
   have no externally revealed law, shall be judged by the law written on
   the heart. That the heathen have such a law, he proves first, from the
   fact that "they do by nature the things contained in the law," i. e.,
   they do under the control of their nature the things which the law
   prescribes; and secondly, from the operations of conscience. When it
   condemns, it pronounces something done, to be contrary to the moral
   law; and when it approves, it pronounces something to be conformed to
   that law. (Rom. ii. 12-16.) The recognition of God, therefore, that is,
   of a being to whom we are responsible, is involved in the very idea of
   accountability. Hence every man carries in the very constitution of his
   being as a moral agent, the evidence of the existence of God. And as
   this sense of sin and responsibility is absolutely universal, so must
   also, according to the Bible, be the knowledge of God.

   2. The second argument in favor of the universality of this knowledge,
   is the historical one. History shows that the religious element of our
   nature is just as universal as the rational or social one. Wherever men
   exist, in all ages and in all parts of the world, they have some form
   of religion. The idea of God is impressed on every human language. And
   as language is the product and revelation of human consciousness, if
   all languages have some name for God, it proves that the idea of God,
   in some form, belongs to every human being.

   Objections to the Assumption that the Knowledge of God is Universal.

   There are two objections often urged against the doctrine that the
   knowledge of God results from the very constitution of our nature, and
   is therefore universal. The one is, that travellers and missionaries
   report the existence of some tribes so degraded that they could
   discover in them no traces of this knowledge. Even if the fact be
   admitted that such tribes have no idea of God, it would not be
   conclusive. Should a tribe of idiots be discovered, it would not prove
   that reason is not an attribute of our nature. If any community should
   come to light in which infanticide was universal, it would not prove
   that parental love was not one of the instincts of humanity. But the
   probability is that the fact is not as reported. It is very difficult
   for foreigners to get acquainted with the interior life of those who
   differ from themselves so much in their intellectual and moral
   condition. And besides, Christians attach such an exalted meaning to
   the word God, that when they see no evidence of the presence of that
   exalted conception in the minds of the heathen, they are apt to
   conclude that all knowledge of God is wanting. Unless such people show
   that they have no sense of right and wrong, no consciousness of
   responsibility for character and conduct, there is no evidence that
   they have no knowledge of such a being as God.

   The other objection is drawn from the case of the deaf and dumb, who
   sometimes say that previous to instruction, the idea of God never
   entered their minds. To this the same answer may be given. The
   knowledge obtained by Christian instruction so much surpasses that
   given by intuition, that the latter seems as nothing. It is hardly
   conceivable that a human soul should exist in any state of development,
   without a sense of responsibility, and this involves the idea of God.
   For the responsibility is felt to be not to self, nor to men, but to an
   invisible Being, higher than self, and higher than man.

   The Belief in God Necessary.

   But if it be admitted that the knowledge of God is universal among men,
   is it also a necessary belief? Is it impossible for the mind to
   dispossess itself of the conviction that there is a God? Necessity, as
   remarked above, may be considered as involved in universality, at least
   in such a case as this. There is no satisfactory way of accounting for
   the universal belief in the existence of God, except that such belief
   is founded on the very constitution of our nature. Nevertheless, these
   two criteria of intuitive truths are generally distinguished, and are
   in some aspects distinct.

   The question then is, Is it possible for a sane man to disbelieve in
   the existence of God? This question is commonly answered in the
   negative. It is objected, however, that facts prove the contrary. No
   man has ever been found, who denies that two and two make four, whereas
   atheists abound in every age and in every part of the world.

   There, are, however, different kinds of necessary truths.

   1. Those the opposite of which is absolutely unthinkable. That every
   effect must have a cause, that a part of a given thing is less than the
   whole, are propositions the opposites of which cannot have any meaning.
   When a man says that something is nothing, he expresses no thought. He
   denies what he affirms, and therefore says nothing.

   2. There are truths concerning external or material things, which have
   a power to constrain belief different from that power which pertains to
   truths concerning the mind. A man cannot deny that he has a body; and
   he cannot rationally deny that he has a will. The impossibility in both
   cases may be equal, but they are of different kinds, and affect the
   mind differently.

   3. Again, there are truths which cannot be denied without doing
   violence to the laws of our nature. In such cases the denial is forced,
   and can only be temporary. The laws of our nature are sure sooner or
   later to assert themselves, and constrain an opposite belief. A
   pendulum when at rest hangs perpendicularly to the horizon. It may by
   extraneous force be made to hang at any degree of inclination. But as
   soon as such force is removed, it is sure to swing back to its normal
   position. Under the control of a metaphysical theory, a man may deny
   the existence of the external world, or the obligation of the moral
   law; and his disbelief may be sincere, and for a time persistent; but
   the moment the speculative reasons for his disbelief are absent from
   his mind, it of necessity reverts to its original and natural
   convictions. It is also possible that a man's hand may be so hardened
   or cauterized as to lose the sense of touch. But that would not prove
   that the hand in man is not normally the great organ of touch. So it is
   possible that the moral nature of a man may be so disorganized by vice
   or by a false philosophy as to have its testimony for the existence of
   God effectually silenced. This, however, would prove nothing as to what
   that testimony really is. Besides this, insensibility and the
   consequent unbelief cannot last. Whatever rouses the moral nature,
   whether it be danger, or suffering, or the approach of death, banishes
   unbelief in a moment. Men pass from skepticism to faith, in many cases,
   instantaneously; not of course by a process of argument, but by the
   existence of a state of consciousness with which skepticism is
   irreconcilable, and in the presence of which it cannot exist. This fact
   is illustrated continually, not only in the case of the uneducated and
   superstitious, but even in the case of men of the highest culture. The
   simple fact of Scripture and experience is, that the moral law as
   written upon the heart is indelible; and the moral law in its nature
   implies a lawgiver, one from whom that law emanates, and by whom it
   will be enforced. And, therefore, so long as men are moral creatures,
   they will and must believe in the existence of a Being on whom they are
   dependent, and to whom they are responsible for their character and
   their conduct. To this extent, and in this sense, therefore, it is to
   be admitted that the knowledge of God is innate and intuitive; that men
   no more need to be taught that there is a God, than they need to be
   taught there is such a thing as sin. But as men are ignorant of the
   nature and extent of sin, while aware of its existence, until
   instructed by the Word of God, and enlightened by his Spirit; so they
   greatly need the same sources of instruction to give them any adequate
   knowledge of the nature of God, and of their relations to him.

   § 2. The Knowledge of God is not due to a Process of Reasoning.

   Those who are unwilling to admit that the idea of God is innate as
   given in the very constitution of man, generally hold that it is a
   necessary, or, at least, a natural deduction of reason. Sometimes it is
   represented as the last and highest generalization of science. As the
   law of gravitation is assumed to account for a large class of the
   phenomena of the universe, and as it not only does account for them,
   but must be assumed in order to understand them; so the existence of an
   intelligent first cause is assumed to account for the existence of the
   universe itself, and for all its phenomena. But as such generalizations
   are possible only for cultivated minds, this theory of the origin of
   the idea of God, cannot account for belief in his existence in the
   minds of all men, even the least educated.

   Others, therefore, while regarding this knowledge to be the result of a
   course of reasoning, make the process far more simple. There are many
   things which children and illiterate persons learn, and can hardly
   avoid learning, which need not be referred to the constitution of their
   nature. Thus the existence of God is so obviously manifested, by
   everything within and around us, the belief in that existence is so
   natural, so suited to what we see and what we need, that it comes to be
   generally adopted. We are surrounded by facts which indicate design; by
   effects which demand a cause. We have a sense of the infinite which is
   vague and void, until filled with God. We have a knowledge of ourselves
   as spiritual beings, which suggests the idea of God, who is a spirit.
   We have the consciousness of moral qualities, of the distinction
   between good and evil, and this makes us think of God as a being of
   moral perfections. All this may be very true, but it is not an adequate
   account of the facts of the case. It does not give a satisfactory
   reason for the universality and strength of the conviction of the
   existence of God. Our own consciousness teaches us that this is not the
   ground of our own faith. We do not thus reason ourselves into the
   belief that there is a God; and it is very obvious that it is not by
   such a process of ratiocination, simple as it is, that the mass of the
   people are brought to this conclusion.

   Moreover, the process above described does not account for the origin
   of our belief in God, but only gives the method by which that belief is
   confirmed and developed. Very little is given by intuition in any case,
   at least to ordinary minds. What is thus discovered needs to be
   expanded, and its real contents unfolded. If this be true with the
   intuitions of sense and of the understanding, why should it not be so
   of our religious nature?

   The truth is, that all the faculties and feelings of our minds and
   bodies have their appropriate objects; and the possession of the
   faculties supposes the existence of those objects. The senses suppose
   the existence and reality of the objects of sense. The eye, in its very
   structure, supposes that there is such an element as light; the sense
   of hearing would be unaccountable and inconceivable without sound; and
   the sense of touch would be inconceivable were there no tangible
   objects. The same is true of our social affections; they necessitate
   the assumption that there are relations suited to their exercises. Our
   moral nature supposes that the distinction between right and wrong is
   not chimerical or imaginary. In like manner, our religious feelings,
   our sense of dependence, our consciousness of responsibility, our
   aspirations after fellowship with some Being higher than ourselves, and
   higher than anything which the world or nature contains, necessitates
   the belief in the existence of God. It is indeed said that if this
   belief is intuitive and necessary, there is no virtue in it. This
   objection overlooks the fact that the moral character of our feelings
   depends on their nature and not on their origin. They may spring from
   the constitution of our nature, and yet be good or evil as the case may
   be. A mother's love for her child is instinctive; the absence of the
   maternal affection in a mother is something unnatural and monstrous,
   the object of universal condemnation. The sense of pity, of justice,
   the feelings of benevolence, are instinctive, but none the less
   virtuous. The same is true of our religious feelings, and of the belief
   which they involve. We cannot help feeling that we are responsible, and
   it is right that we should feel so. The man who has brought himself to
   a state of insensibility to all moral obligation, is what the
   Scriptures call a "reprobate." Adam believed in God the moment he was
   created, for the same reason that he believed in the external world.
   His religious nature, unclouded and undefiled, apprehended the one with
   the same confidence that his senses apprehended the other. It is of
   great importance that men should know and feel that they are by their
   very nature bound to believe in God; that they cannot emancipate
   themselves from that belief, without derationalizing and demoralizing
   their whole being.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 3. Knowledge of God not due exclusively to Tradition.

   There are some theologians who are unable to believe that the knowledge
   of God can be referred either to the constitution of our nature, or to
   any process of reasoning. Not only the exalted view of the Divine Being
   presented in the Bible, but the simple and perverted apprehensions of
   his nature prevailing among the heathen, they say must be referred to
   an original supernatural revelation. Such a revelation was made to our
   first parents and from them passed over to their descendants. When the
   knowledge thus communicated began to die out among men, God again
   revealed himself to Abraham, and made him and his posterity the
   depositaries of the truth. Either, therefore, from the remains of the
   primitive revelation, or by radiation from the chosen people, all the
   knowledge of God existing in the world has been derived. The attempt is
   made to show that the more remote any people were from the Jews, the
   less did they know of God; and the more any nation enjoyed of
   intercourse with the people to whom God had committed his oracles, the
   more correct and extended was their knowledge.

   This view, although arising from reverence for the Word of God, is
   evidently extreme. It is true that the further we go back in the
   history of the world, the nearer we approach the primal revelation, the
   purer is the knowledge concerning Him. It may also be true, as a
   general rule, that the more any people were brought under the influence
   of the truth as held by the chosen people of God, the more enlightened
   they became. It may further be conceded that those who with the Bible
   in their hands reject its teachings, and give themselves up to their
   own speculations, turn, as the Apostle expresses it, "the truth of God
   into a lie," losing all knowledge of the living and true God. All this,
   however, does not prove that the knowledge of God is not written on the
   heart. Our intuitive perceptions need to be cherished, developed, and
   interpreted. We know from Scripture that the law is written in
   characters which cannot be obliterated, upon the souls of all men, and
   yet it has been perverted, misinterpreted, or disregarded by men in
   every age and in every part of the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 4. Can the Existence of God be proved?

   A large class of theologians and philosophers deny that the existence
   of God is susceptible of proof. This is done on different grounds.

   First. It is said that the knowledge of God being intuitive, it is not
   a proper subject of proof. This is the position taken by that class of
   theologians who resolve all religion into feeling, and by the modern
   school of speculative philosophers, who make such a wide distinction
   between the reason and the understanding; the former being the
   intuitional, and the latter the discursive faculty. Eternal and
   necessary truths belong to the province of the reason; subordinate
   truths to the sphere of the understanding. It is the understanding that
   argues and concludes. The reason apprehends by immediate vision. What
   relates to God, as the eternal, infinite, necessary Being, belongs to
   the province of reason, and not to that of the understanding. Even such
   theistic writers as Twesten [133] say that the good need no proof that
   God is, and that the wicked are not susceptible of conviction. You
   cannot prove that a thing is beautiful, or that it is good. So neither
   can you prove that there is a God. The fallacy of this statement is
   obvious. Beauty and goodness are qualities which must be discerned by
   the mind, just as the objects of sight are discerned by the eye. As it
   is true that you cannot prove to a blind man that an object is red, so
   you cannot prove to a peasant that the "Paradise Lost" is sublime. But
   the existence of God is an objective fact. It may be shown that it is a
   fact which cannot be rationally denied. Although all men have feelings
   and convictions which necessitate the assumption that there is a God;
   it is, nevertheless, perfectly legitimate to show that there are other
   facts which necessarily lead to the same conclusion.

   Besides, it is to be remembered that theistical arguments are designed
   to prove not only that there is a necessity for the assumption of all
   extra-mundane and eternal Being, but mainly, to show what that Being
   is; that He is a personal Being, self-conscious, intelligent, moral.
   All this may lie inclosed in the primary intuition, but it needs to be
   brought out and established.

   Secondly. Another class of objections against all theistical arguments,
   relates to the arguments themselves. They are pronounced fallacious, as
   involving a petitio principii; or declared to be invalid as derived
   from false premises; or heading to conclusions other than that intended
   to be established. Of this every man must judge for himself. They have
   been regarded as sound and conclusive by the wisest men, from Socrates
   to the present day. Of course the argument on the principle of
   causation must be invalid to those who deny that there is any such
   thing as an efficient cause; and the argument from design can have no
   force for those who deny the possibility of final causes.

   Most of the objections to the conclusiveness of the arguments in
   question arises from a misapprehension of what they are intended to
   prove. It is often assumed that each argument must prove the whole
   doctrine of Theism; whereas one argument may prove one element of that
   doctrine; and other arguments different elements. The cosmological
   argument may prove the existence of a necessary and eternal Being; the
   teleological argument, that that Being is intelligent; the moral
   argument that He is a possessing moral attributes. The arguments are
   not designed so much to prove the existence of an unknown being, as to
   demonstrate that the Being who reveals himself to man in the very
   constitution of his nature must be all that Theism declares him to be.
   Such writers as Hume, Kant, Coleridge, and the whole school of
   transcendental philosophers, have more or less expressly denied the
   validity of the ordinary arguments for the existence of a personal God.

CHAPTER II.

  THEISM.

   Theism is the doctrine of an extra-mundane, personal God, the creator,
   preserver, and governor of the world. The design of all arguments on
   this subject is to show that the facts around us, and the facts of
   consciousness, necessitate the assumption of the existence of such a
   Being. The arguments usually urged on this subject are the Ontological,
   the Cosmological, the Teleological, and the Moral.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. The Ontological Argument.

   This is a metaphysical à priori argument. It is designed to show that
   the real objective existence of God is involved in the very idea of
   such a Being. It is commonly made to include all arguments which are
   not à posteriori; that is, which do not proceed from effect to cause.
   It has, therefore, been presented in different forms. The principal of
   which are the following: --

   1. That in which it is presented by Anselm in his "Monologium," and
   more fully and definitely in his "Proslogium." The argument is
   substantially this. That which exists in re is greater than that which
   exists only in the mind. We have an idea of an infinitely perfect
   Being; but actual existence is included, in infinite perfection.
   Because, if actual existence be a perfection, and if God is not
   actually existent, then we can conceive of a Being greater than God.
   His words [134] are, "Et certe id, quo majus cogitari nequit, non
   potest esse in intellectu solo. Si enim vel in solo intellectu est,
   potest cogitari esse et in re, quod majus est. . . . . Existit ergo
   procul dubio aliquid, quo majus cogitari non valet, et in intellectu et
   in re." This argument assumes that existence is of the nature of a
   perfection. It adds, however, nothing to the idea. The idea in itself
   may be complete, although there be no objective existence to answer to
   it. Anselm regarded the negation of the existence of God as impossible;
   for God is the highest truth, the highest being, the highest good, of
   whom all other truth and good are the manifestations. Necessity of
   existence is included, according to this doctrine, in the idea or
   absolute perfection. In other words, it is included in the idea of God.
   And as every man has the idea of God, he must admit his actual
   existence; for what is necessary is of course actual. It does not
   follow from our idea of a man, that he actually exists, because man is
   not necessarily existent. But it is absurd to say that a necessarily
   existing Being, does not exist. If this argument has any validity, it
   is unimportant. It is only saying that what must be actually is. If the
   idea of God as it exists in every man's mind includes that of actual
   existence, then so far as the idea goes, he who has the one has the
   other. But the argument does not show how the ideal implies the real.
   [135]

   Des Cartes' Argument.

   2. Des Cartes' argument was in this form. We have the idea of an
   infinitely perfect Being. As we are finite, that idea could not have
   originated with us. As we are conversant only with the finite, it could
   not have originated from anything around us. It must, therefore, have
   come from God, whose existence is thus a necessary assumption. "Habemus
   ideam Dei, hujusque ideæ realitas objectiva nec formaliter nec
   eminenter in nobis continetur, nec in ullo alio præterquam in ipso Deo
   potest contineri; ergo hæc idea Dei, quæ in nobis est, requirit Deum
   pro causa; Deusque proinde existit." [136] It is true we have many
   ideas or conceptions to which there is no answering existence. But in
   such cases the ideas are arbitrary, or voluntary creations of our own
   minds. But the idea of God is necessary; we cannot help having it. And
   having it, there must be a Being who answers to it. Des Cartes
   illustrates his argument by saying, that as it is included in our idea
   of a triangle, that its angles are equal to two right angles, it is so
   in fact. The cases, however, are not parallel. It is only saying that a
   triangle is what it is, namely, a three-sided figure, whose angles are
   equal to two right angles. But the existence of God as a fact is not
   included in the definition of Him. Kant expresses this in philosophical
   language, saying that if the predicate be removed, the subject is
   removed; because an analytic judgment is a mere analysis, or full
   statement of what is in the subject. The judgment that the angles of a
   triangle are equal to two right angles, is only an analysis of the
   subject. It is a simple statement of what a triangle is; and therefore,
   if you take away the equality of the angles, you take away the
   triangle. But in a synthetic judgment, there is a synthesis, a putting
   together. Something is added in the judgment which is not in the
   subject. In this case that something is actual existence. We may infer
   from the idea of a perfect being, that he is wise and good; but not
   that he actually is; because reality is something added to the mere
   idea.

   The only difference between the argument of Des Cartes and that of
   Anselm, appears to be merely formal. The one infers the existence of
   God, in order to account for the idea; the other argues that actual
   existence is included in the idea. The same illustration, therefore, is
   employed by the advocates of both. The argument of Anselm is the same
   as that derived from the definition of a triangle. You cannot think of
   a triangle without thinking of it as having three angles; so you cannot
   think of God without thinking of Him as actually existent; because
   actual existence enters as essentially into the idea of God, as
   "triangularity" enters into that of a triangle. There are, doubtless,
   minds which are affected by this kind of reasoning; but it has no power
   over the generality of men.

   Dr. Samuel Clarke's Argument.

   3. Dr. Samuel Clarke, equally distinguished as a mathematician, as a
   linguist, and as a metaphysician, published in 1705, his celebrated
   "Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God." So far as the Being
   of God is concerned his argument is à priori. Nothing, he says, is
   necessarily existent, the non-existence of which is conceivable. We can
   conceive of the non-existence of the world; therefore the world is not
   necessarily existing and eternal. We cannot, however, conceive of the
   non-existence of space and duration; therefore space and duration are
   necessary and infinite. Space and duration, however, are not
   substances; therefore, there must he an eternal and necessary substance
   (i.e., God), of which they are the accidents. This argument at best
   gives us only the idea of a necessary and infinite something; which no
   class of anti-theists are disposed to deny. To determine what this
   eternal substance is, what attributes belong to it, reference must be
   made to the phenomenal world, and the argument becomes à posteriori. It
   has been objected to Dr. Clarke's argument that it is not properly à
   priori. It infers from the existence of the and space the existence of
   a substantial Being.

   Cousin's Argument.

   4. Cousin, in his "Elements of Psychology," repeats continually the
   same argument in a somewhat different form. The idea of the infinite,
   he says, is given in that of the finite. We cannot have the one without
   having the other. "These two ideas are logical correlatives; and in the
   order of their acquisition, that of the finite and imperfect precedes
   the other; but it scarcely precedes it. It is not possible for the
   reason, as soon as consciousness furnishes the mind with the idea of
   the finite and imperfect, not to conceive the idea of the infinite and
   perfect. Now, the infinite and perfect is God." [137] Here again the
   argument is, that that is real of which we have an idea. This is not
   indeed assumed as a general proposition. We can imagine, says Cousin, a
   gorgon, or centaur, and we can imagine them not to exist; but it is not
   in our power, when the finite and imperfect are given, not to conceive
   of the infinite and perfect. This is not a chimera, he says, it is the
   necessary product of reason; and, therefore, it is a legitimate
   product. The idea of the finite and imperfect is a primitive idea,
   given in the consciousness; and therefore, the correlative, idea of the
   infinite and perfect given by necessity and by the reason, must also be
   primitive. [138] At other times he presents this subject in a different
   light. He teaches that, as the mind in perception takes cognizance of
   the object as a real existence, distinct from itself, so the reason has
   an apprehension, or immediate cognition of the Infinite, with a
   necessary conviction of its reality as distinguished (in one sense)
   from itself. Self, nature, and God are alike and equally involved in
   the intuitive apprehension of the mind; and they are inseparable. This
   is very different from the common doctrine of the knowledge of God as
   innate, or intuitive. The latter doctrine only assumes that such is the
   nature of the human soul that it is intuitively convinced of its
   dependence on, and responsibility to a Being other than, and higher
   than itself. The former assumes, with the German philosophers,
   especially Schelling, the immediate cognition of the Infinite by the
   reason.

   Admitting with Cousin that the ideas of the finite and infinite are
   correlative; that we cannot have the one without having the other; and
   that the mind by a rational necessity is convinced that if there be a
   finite, there must be an infinite; it remains to be asked. What that
   Infinite is? With Cousin, the Infinite is the All. Theism therefore
   gains nothing from these metaphysical arguments.

   § 2. The Cosmological Argument.

   This is founded on the principle of a sufficient cause. Syllogistically
   stated, the argument stands thus: Every effect must have an adequate
   cause. The world is an effect. Therefore the world must have had a
   cause outside of itself and adequate to account for its existence.

   A. Causation.

   The validity and the meaning of this argument, depend on the sense
   given to the words effect and cause. If an effect be correctly defined
   to be an event, or product, not due to anything in itself, but produced
   by something out of itself; and if by cause be understood, an
   antecedent to whose efficiency the effect is due; then the conclusion
   is inevitable, that the existence of the world supposes the existence
   of a cause adequate to its production, provided it can be proved that
   the world is an effect, i.e., that it is not self-caused or eternal.

   It is well known, however, that since Hume propounded his theory, all
   efficient causes have been discarded by a large class of philosophers.
   The senses take cognizance of nothing but the sequence of events. One
   follows another. That which uniformly precedes, we call cause; that
   which uniformly follows, we call the effect. As sequence is all the
   senses detect, that is all we have any right to assume. The idea that
   there is anything in the antecedent which determines the effect to be
   as it is and no otherwise, is altogether arbitrary. A cause, therefore,
   is nothing but an invariable antecedent, and an effect an invariable
   consequent.

   Mr. Stuart Mill [139] modified Hume's definition of cause as Dr. Brown
   of Edinburgh had done before him. The former says, "It is necessary to
   our using the word cause, that we should believe not only that the
   antecedent always has been followed by the consequent, but that, as
   long as the present constitution of things endures, it always will be
   so." So Dr. Brown [140] says, "A cause in the fullest definition which
   it philosophically admits of, may be said to be that which immediately
   precedes any change, and which, existing at any time in similar
   circumstances, has been always, and will be always immediately followed
   by a similar change." It is obvious that this definition is not only
   arbitrary, but that it is inconsistent with the fundamental principles
   of Hume's philosophy, and that of his followers, namely, that all our
   knowledge is founded on experience. Experience relates to the past. It
   cannot guarantee the future. If we believe that a given consequent
   always will follow a given antecedent, there must be some other ground
   for that conviction than that it always has done so. Unless there be
   something in the nature of the antecedent to secure the sequence of the
   effect, there is no rational ground for the belief that the future must
   be like the past.

   The Common Doctrine on the Subject.

   The common doctrine on this subject includes the following points. (1.)
   A cause is something. It has a real existence. It is not merely a name
   for a certain relation. It is a real entity, a substance. This is plain
   because a nonentity cannot act. If that which does not exist can be a
   cause, then nothing can produce something, which is a contradiction.
   (2.) A cause must not only be something real, but it must have power or
   efficiency. There must be something in its nature to account for the
   effects which it produces. (3.) This efficiency must be adequate; that
   is, sufficient and appropriate to the effect. That this is a true view
   of the nature of a cause is plain. (1.) From our own consciousness. We
   are causes. We can produce effects. And all three of the particulars
   above mentioned are included in our consciousness of ourselves as
   cause. We are real existences; we have power; we have power adequate to
   the effects which we produce. (2.) We can appeal to the universal
   consciousness of men. All men attach this meaning to the word cause in
   their ordinary language. All men assume that every effect has an
   antecedent to whose efficiency it is due. They never regard mere
   antecedence, however uniform in the past, or however certain in the
   future, as constituting a causal relation. The succession of the
   seasons has been uniform in the past, and we are confident that it will
   continue uniform in the future; yet no man says that winter is the
   cause of summer. Every one is conscious that cause expresses an
   entirely different relation from that of mere antecedence. (3.) This
   view of the nature of causation is included in the universal and
   necessary belief, that every effect must have a cause. That belief is
   not that one thing must always go before another thing; but that
   nothing can occur, that no change can be produced, without the exercise
   of power or efficiency somewhere; otherwise something could come out of
   nothing.

   This subject is discussed by all the metaphysicians from Aristotle
   downwards, and especially since the promulgation of the new doctrine
   adopted by Hume [141] It is one of the great services rendered by Dr.
   McCosh to the cause of truth, that he has defended the authority of
   those primary beliefs which lie at the foundation of all knowledge.

   Intuitive Conviction of the Necessity of a Cause.

   But admitting a cause to be not merely an invariable antecedent, but
   that to whose power the effect is due, "Ens quod in se continet
   rationem, cur aliud existat," [142] as it is defined by Wolf, it
   remains to be asked, What is the foundation of the universal belief
   that every effect must have a cause? Hume says it is founded on
   experience, and therefore is limited by it. We see that every effect
   within the sphere of our observation is preceded by a cause, and we may
   reasonably expect that the same is true beyond the sphere of our
   observation. But of this we know nothing. It would be presumptuous to
   determine from what takes place on our little globe, what must be the
   law of the universe. The fact that, as far as we see, every effect has
   a cause, gives us no right to assume that the universe must have had a
   cause. Kant says that the law of cause and effect is only in our minds.
   Men view things in that relation; but they have no assurance that that
   relation holds in the world outside of themselves.

   The common doctrine of the schools is, that it is an intuitive truth, a
   first, or self-evident principle. That is, that it is something which
   all men do believe, and which all men must believe. There are no
   self-evident, intuitive truths, if the fact that they have been denied
   by one or more speculative philosophers be considered proof that they
   are not matters of universal and necessary belief. Personal identity,
   the real existence of the external world, the essential distinction
   between right and wrong, have all been denied. Nevertheless, all men
   do, and all men must believe these truths. The denial of them is forced
   and temporary. Whenever the mind reverts to its normal state, the
   belief returns. So the principle of causation has been denied; yet
   every man is forced by the constitution of his nature to admit it, and
   constantly to act upon it. A man may believe that the universe is
   eternal; but that it began to be without a cause -- that it sprang out
   of nothing -- it is impossible to believe.

   We are reduced, therefore, to this alternative. The universe is. It
   therefore either has been from all eternity, or it owes its existence
   to a cause out of itself, adequate to account for its being what it is
   The theistical argument is, that the world is an effect; that it has
   not the cause of existence in itself, that it is not eternal, and
   therefore we are necessitated to assume the existence of a great First
   Cause to whose efficiency the existence of the universe is to be
   referred.

   B. The World is an Effect.

   1. The first argument to prove that the world as a whole is not
   self-existent and eternal, is, that all its parts, everything that
   enters into its composition, is dependent and mutable. A whole cannot
   be essentially different from its constituent parts. An infinite number
   of effects cannot be self-existent. If a chain of three links cannot
   support itself, much less can a chain of a million of links. Nothing
   multiplied by infinity is nothing still. If we do not find the cause of
   our existence in ourselves, nor our parents in themselves, nor their
   progenitors in themselves, going back ad infinitum is only adding
   nothing to nothing. What the mind demands is a sufficient cause, and no
   approach to it is made by going back indefinitely from one effect to
   another. We are forced, therefore, by the laws of our rational nature,
   to assume the existence of a self-existent cause, i.e., a Being endued
   with power adequate to produce this ever-changing phenomenal world. In
   all ages thinking men have been forced to this conclusion. Plato and
   Aristotle argued from the existence of motion, that there must be an
   aeikineton heauto kinoun, an eternal self-moving power, or primum
   movens, as it was called by the Schoolmen. The validity of this
   argument is acknowledged by almost all classes of philosophers, at
   least so far as to admit that we are forced to assume the existence of
   an eternal and necessary Being. The theistical argument is, that if
   everything in the world be contingent, this eternal and necessary Being
   must be an extramundane First Cause.

   B. Historical Argument.

   2. The second argument is the historical one. That is, we have
   historical evidence that the race of man, for example, has existed only
   a few thousand years. That mankind has existed from eternity is
   absolutely incredible. Even if we adopt the development theory, it
   affords no relief. It only substitutes millions for thousands of years.
   Both are equally insignificant when compared to eternity. Darwin's
   germ-cell as necessarily demands a self-existing cause out of itself,
   as a fully developed man, or the whole race of man, or the universe
   itself. We are shut up to the conclusion that the universe sprang out
   of nothing, or that there is a self-existing, eternal extramundane
   Being.

   Geological Argument.

   3. The geological argument is to the same effect. Geologists as a class
   agree as to the following facts: (1.) That the extant genera of plants
   and animals inhabiting our earth, began to be within a comparatively
   short period in the history of our globe. (2.) That neither experience
   nor science, neither fact nor reason, justify the assumption of
   spontaneous generation. That is, there is no evidence that any living
   organism is ever produced by mere physical causes. Every such organism
   is either immediately created, or is derived from some other organism
   having life, already existing. (3.) Genera and species are permanent.
   One never passes into another. A fish never becomes a bird, nor a bird
   a quadruped. Modern theorists have indeed questioned these facts; but
   they still are admitted by the great body of scientific men, and the
   evidence in their favour is overwhelming to the ordinary mind. If these
   principles be conceded, it follows that all the extant plants and
   animals on the earth began to be. And if they began to be, they were
   created, and therefore there must be a Creator. These considerations
   are merely collateral. The main argument is the one first mentioned,
   namely, the absolute impossibility of conceiving either of an infinite
   succession of contingent events, or of the origin of the universe out
   of nothing.

   C. Objections. Hume's Doctrine.

   There are only two objections to this cosmological argument which need
   be noticed. The one is directed to the principle on which it is
   founded, and the other to the conclusion drawn from it. Hume begins his
   "Treatise on Human Nature," by laying down the principle that the
   perceptions of the human mind resolve themselves into impressions and
   ideas. By impressions he means "all our sensations, passions, and
   emotions, as they make their first appearance in the soul." By ideas is
   meant "the faint images of these in thinking and reasoning." [143]
   There can, therefore, be no idea which is not derived from some
   previous impression. This is the fundamental principle of his whole
   system. From this it follows that all our knowledge is founded on
   experience. We have certain impressions made by external things, and
   certain passions and emotions; these are the only sources of our ideas,
   and therefore of our knowledge. When [144] he comes to apply this
   principle to the nature and origin of our idea of causation, he says,
   all we can know on the subject is that one object or event is
   contiguous and antecedent to another. This is all we perceive; all of
   which we can have an "impression." We have no impression of power,
   efficacy, energy, force, or whatever equivalent term we may choose to
   use. Therefore, there is no such thing. There is no such thing as
   efficacy or power either in mind or matter. When we use such words we
   have, he says, "really no distinct meaning." [145] When we see events
   or changes in uniform sequence, we get the habit, or, as he says, "we
   feel the determination," [146] to expect the consequent when we see its
   accustomed antecedent. Necessity, force, power, efficacy, therefore,
   are nothing but "a determination to carry our thoughts from one object
   to another." [147] "The necessity of power, which unites causes and
   effects, lies in the determination of the mind to pass from the one to
   the other. The efficacy or energy of causes is neither placed in the
   causes themselves, nor in the Deity, nor in the concurrence of these
   two principles; but belongs entirely to the soul, which considers the
   union of two or more objects in all past instances." [148] Hume was
   fully aware of the paradoxical character of his view of causation and
   of its far-reaching consequences, although he insisted that his
   argument in its support was unanswerable. In immediate connection with
   the preceding quotation, he says: "I am sensible, that of all the
   paradoxes which I have had, or shall hereafter have, occasion to
   advance in the course of this treatise, the present one is the most
   violent, and that 'tis merely by dint of solid proof and reasoning I
   can ever hope it will have admission, and overcome the inveterate
   prejudices of mankind" [149] What he calls inveterate prejudices, are
   really laws of belief which God has impressed on our nature, and which
   all the sophistry of philosophers can never subvert.

   The conclusions which Hume draws from his doctrine show his
   appreciation of its importance. (1.) It follows, he says, from his
   principle that there is no difference between causes as efficient,
   formal, material, exemplary, or final; nor between cause and occasion.
   (2.) "That the common distinction betwixt moral and physical necessity
   is without any foundation in nature." "The distinction which we often
   make betwixt power and the exercise of it, is equally without
   foundation." (3.) "That the necessity of a cause to every beginning of
   existence is not founded on any arguments either demonstrative or
   intuitive." (4.) "We can never have reason to believe that any object
   exists, of which we cannot form an idea." [150] By this fourth
   corollary, he has reference to such things as substance, from which we
   receive no impression, and consequently of which we can have no idea,
   and therefore cannot rationally believe to exist. The same may be said
   of God.

   In the beginning of the following section, [151] Hume with a boldness
   almost unparalleled says: "According to the precedent doctrine, there
   are no objects which, by the mere survey, without consulting
   experience, we can determine to be the causes of any other; and no
   objects which we can certainly determine in the same manner not to be
   causes. Anything may produce anything. Creation, annihilation, motion,
   reason, volition, all these may arise from one another, or from any
   other object we can imagine. Nor will this appear strange if we compare
   two principles explained above, that the constant conjunction of
   objects determines their causation; and that, properly speaking, no
   objects are contrary to each other but existence and non-existence.
   Where objects are not contrary, nothing hinders them from having that
   constant conjunction on which the relation of cause and effect totally
   depends."

   If there be any such argument as the reductio ad absurdum, surely this
   theory of Hume refutes itself. (1.) He admits the trustworthiness of
   consciousness so far as "impressions" are concerned; then how can he
   reject the intuitions of sense, reason, and conscience? (2.) If we have
   no knowledge which is not derived from impressions, and no right to
   believe in the existence of anything of which we have not an idea
   derived from an impression, then we cannot believe in substance, soul,
   or God. (3.) For the same reason we cannot believe that there is any
   such thing as power or efficiency, or any difference between efficient
   and final causes, i.e., between the expansive force of steam and the
   intention of the mechanist who makes a steam-engine. (4.) In like
   manner, we must believe that something can come out of nothing, that
   there is no reason that what begins to be should have a cause, even an
   antecedent; and, therefore, that "anything can produce anything," e.g.,
   a human volition, the universe. (5.) He cannot even state his theory
   without contradicting himself. He speaks of one thing "producing"
   another. But according to his doctrine there is no such thing as
   production, because he denies that there is any such thing as power or
   efficiency.

   It is universally admitted that we have no foundation for knowledge or
   faith, but the veracity of consciousness. This principle must be kept
   constantly in view, and must be often reiterated. Any doctrine,
   therefore, which contradicts the facts of consciousness, or the laws of
   belief which God has impressed on our nature, must be false. If,
   therefore, it can be shown that there are certain truths which men are
   constrained by the constitution of their nature to believe, those
   truths are to be retained in despite of all the arts of sophistry. If,
   therefore, it be a fact of consciousness that we ourselves are
   something, an ens, a substance, and that we have power, that we can
   produce effects, then it is certain that there is such a thing as
   power, and efficient cause. If, moreover, it be an intuitive and
   necessary truth that every effect must have a cause, that ex nihilo
   nihil fit, then it is absolutely certain that if the world began to be,
   it had an adequate cause of its existence out of itself. And,
   therefore, if the arguments to prove that the world is not
   self-existing and eternal be sound, the cosmological argument is valid
   and conclusive.

   The Second Objection.

   The other form of objection is directed not against the premises on
   which the cosmological argument is founded, but against the conclusion
   which Theists draw from them. It is admitted that something now exists;
   that nonentity cannot be the cause of real existence; therefore,
   something must have existed from eternity. It is also admitted that a
   regressus ad infinitum, or an eternal series of effects, is impossible.
   There must, therefore, be an eternal, self-existing Being. This is all
   the cosmological argument fairly proves. It does not prove that this
   necessary Being is extramundane, much less that it is a personal God.
   It may be an eternal substance of which things mutable are the
   phenomena. [152]

   The cosmological argument is not intended to prove all that Theists
   hold to be true concerning God. It is enough that it proves that we
   must admit the existence of an eternal and necessary Being. Other
   arguments prove that that Being is self-conscious and intelligent. The
   argument, moreover, fairly proves that this Being is extramundane; for
   the principle of causation is that everything contingent must have the
   cause of its existence out of itself.

   § 3. The Teleological Argument.

   A. Its Nature.

   This argument also admits of being stated in a syllogistic form. Design
   supposes a designer. The world everywhere exhibits marks of design.
   Therefore the world owes its existence to an intelligent author.

   By design is intended, -- (1.) The selection of an end to be attained.
   (2.) The choice of suitable means for its attainment. (3.) The actual
   application of those means for the accomplishment of the proposed end.

   Such being the nature of design, it is a self-evident truth, or, even
   an identical proposition, that design is indicative of intelligence,
   will, and power. It is simply saying that intelligence in the effect
   implies intelligence in the cause.

   It is moreover true that the intelligence indicated by design is not in
   the thing designed. It must be in an external agent. The mind indicated
   in a book is not in the book itself, but in the author and printer. The
   intelligence revealed by a calculating machine, or any similar work of
   art, is not in the material employed, but in the inventor and artist.
   Neither is the mind indicated in the structure of the bodies of plants
   and animals, in them, but in Him who made them. And in like manner the
   mind indicated in the world at large must be in an extramundane Being.
   There is, indeed, this obvious difference between the works of God and
   the works of man. In every product of human art dead materials are
   fashioned and united to accomplish a given end; but the organized works
   of nature are animated by a living principle. They are fashioned as it
   were from within outward. In other words, they grow; they are not
   constructed. In this respect there is a great difference between a
   house and a tree or the human body. But, nevertheless, in both cases,
   the mind is external to the thing produced; because the end, the
   thought, is prior to the product. As the thought or idea of a machine
   must be in the mind of the mechanist, before the machine is made; so
   the idea or thought of the eye must be anterior to its formation. "It
   is a simple and pregnant conclusion," says Trendelenburg, [153] "that
   so far as design is realized in the world, thought as its ground has
   preceded it." And this thought, he goes on to say, is not dead, as a
   figure or model, it is connected with will and power. It is, therefore,
   in the mind of a person who has the ability and purpose to carry it
   out. He further says, "tiefsinnige Zweckmässigkeit bewustlos und
   blind," cannot be imagined, i.e., a blind and unconscious adaptation of
   means to an end is inconceivable.

   As the conviction that design implies an intelligent agent is intuitive
   and necessary, it is not limited to the narrow sphere of our
   experience. The argument is not, Every house, ship, telescope, or other
   instrument or machine, we ever saw had an intelligent maker, therefore
   we may take it for granted that any similar work of art was not formed
   by chance or by the operation of blind, unconscious forces. The
   argument rather is, Such is the nature of design, that it of necessity
   implies an intelligent agent; and, therefore, where ever, or whenever
   we see evidence of design we are convinced that it is to be referred to
   the operation of mind. On this ground we not only authorized, but
   compelled to apply the argument from design far beyond the limits of
   experience, and to say: It is just as evident that the world had an
   intelligent creator, as that a book had an author. If a man can believe
   that a book was written by chance, or by blind, unconscious force,
   then, and not otherwise, can he rationally deny the validity of the
   argument from design in proof of the existence of a personal God.

   B. Evidences of Design in the World.

   This is a boundless subject. One of the most important and valuable of
   the "Bridgewater Treatises," the volume by Dr. Charles Bell, is devoted
   to "The Hand, its mechanism and vital endowments as evincing design."
   Hundreds of volumes would not be sufficient to exhibit the evidence of
   the intelligent adaptation of means to an end, which the world
   everywhere affords. In the few pages now at command all that can be
   attempted, is an indication of the nature of this evidence. [154]

   Design in Single Organs.

   1. No work of human art can compare with the nicety and completeness of
   the separate organs of organized bodies for the purpose for which they
   are designed. In the eye, for example, there is the most perfect
   optical instrument constructed in accordance with the hidden laws of
   light. We find there the only nerve in the body susceptible of the
   impressions of light and color. That nerve is spread out on the retina.
   The light is admitted through an orifice in the ball, which opening by
   the most delicate arrangement of muscles is enlarged or contracted,
   according to the degree of light which falls on the retina, which
   enlargement or contraction is not dependent on the will, but on the
   stimulus of the light itself. Light, however, merely passing through an
   orifice would make no image of the object from which it was reflected.
   It is, therefore, made to pass through lenses perfect in form so to
   refract the rays as to bring them to a proper focus on the retina. If
   the inner chamber of the eye were white, it would so reflect the rays
   entering the pupil at every angle as to render vision impossible. That
   chamber, and that alone, is lined with a black pigment. By a delicate
   muscular arrangement the eye is enabled to adapt itself to the distance
   of external objects so that the proper focus may be preserved. These
   are a small part of the wonders exhibited by this single organ of the
   body. This organ was fashioned in th darkness of the womb, with a
   self-evident reference to the nature and properties of light, of which
   the creature for whose use it was fashioned had neither knowledge or
   experience. If the eye, therefore, does not indicate the intelligent
   adaptation of means to an end, no such adaptation can be found in any
   work of human ingenuity.

   The same remarks apply to the ear. In its cavity lies the auditory
   nerve. A tortuous passage is formed in the bony structure of the skull.
   The orifice of that passage is covered by a membrane to receive the
   vibration of the air; on the centre of that membrane rests the
   termination of a small bone so connected as to convey those vibrations
   to the only nerve capable of receiving or interpreting them, or of
   transmitting them to the brain. It is by this organ, constructed
   according to the recondite principles of acoustics, that our
   intercourse with our fellow-men is principally kept up; through which
   the marvels of speech, all the charms of music and eloquence become
   possible for man.

   We cannot live without a constant supply of oxygen, which must every
   moment be brought to act upon the blood, to vitalize it, and by
   combining with the carbon it contains fit it for renewed use. The
   infant, therefore, comes into the world with an apparatus prepared for
   that purpose. In its formative state, it did not breathe. Yet it had
   lungs. They were given for a foreseen necessity. Nothing can exceed the
   intricacy, complication, or beauty of the organ or system of organs
   thus prepared, for the absolutely necessary and continuous purification
   of the blood, and for its distribution in an uninterrupted flux and
   reflux to every part of the body. This process goes on without our
   supervision. It is as regular during sleep as during our waking hours.

   Food is as necessary for our support as air. The unborn infant needs no
   food. It is included in the circulation of its mother. In the state on
   which it is soon to enter food will be a necessity. Full provision is
   made beforehand for its reception and use. Teeth are embedded in the
   jaw for its mastication; salivary glands to furnish the fluid for its
   chemical preparation for the stomach; an oesophagus to convey it to the
   stomach, where it meets with a fluid found nowhere else, capable of
   dissolving and digesting it. It then comes into contact with a set of
   absorbent vessels which select from it the elements suited for the
   wants of the body and reject all the rest. The valuable portion is
   poured into the blood by which it is distributed, each constituent
   going to its own place and answering its predestined purpose; carbon to
   be consumed to keep up the vital heat, lime to the bones, fibrine to
   the muscles, phosphorus to the brain and nerves.

   The child before birth has no need of organs for locomotion or for
   apprehending external objects. But it was foreseen that it would need
   them, and therefore they are prepared beforehand. The bones are grooved
   for the reception of muscles, and have projections for points of
   support; joints of all kinds, hinge and ball and socket, for the
   flexure of the limbs; the instruments for motion, the contractile
   fibres, arranged and attached, according to the strict laws of
   mechanics, so as best to secure the two ends of symmetry and power.
   Thus the body is a perfect marvel of mechanical contrivances. The
   several organs, therefore, of the animal frame, viewed separately,
   present the most incontestible evidence of foresight, intelligence, and
   wisdom. This, however, is only a small part of the evidence of design
   furnished even by the body.

   Design in the Relation of one Organ to Another.

   2. Every animal is a complete whole. Each part has a designed and
   predetermined reference to every other part. The organs of sight,
   hearing, breathing, nutrition, locomotion, etc., are so arranged and
   adjusted as to answer a common purpose to the best advantage. Besides,
   these organs, although common to all animals (at least to all above the
   lowest), are modified in each genus and species to meet its peculiar
   necessities. If the animal is to live on the land all its organs are
   adapted to that condition. If it is to live in the water or move
   through the air, all is prepared beforehand for that destination. And
   more than this, if one organ be designed for some special use, all the
   rest are modified in accordance with that purpose. If the stomach is
   suited for the digestion of flesh, then the teeth, the limbs, the
   claws, are all adapted to secure and prepare the proper aliment. So
   complete is the adaptation that the anatomist can determine from a
   single bone the genus or species to which the animal belonged. Birds
   which wade in the water have long legs and long necks. Those which
   float on the surface, have web feet, and feathers impenetrable by
   water; two things which have causal relation, and which are united by a
   kind of intelligence external to the animal itself. Birds which fly in
   the air are fitted for their destiny by hollow bones, wide-spread
   wings, and great accumulation of muscles on the breast. Those which
   climb trees have feet and tail adapted for that purpose, and, as in the
   case of the wood-pecker, a sharp bill for boring the tree and a barbed
   tongue to seize its food. These modifications of animal structure are
   endless, all showing an external intelligence cognizant of the
   necessities of every distinct species.

   The Adaptation of the Organs to the Instinct of Animals

   3. There is a correspondence between the organs of every animal and the
   instincts by which it is endowed. Beasts and birds of prey having the
   instinct to feed on flesh have all the organs requisite to satisfy this
   inward craving. Those having an instinct for vegetable food, have teeth
   and stomachs adapted for that purpose. The bee whose body secretes wax,
   has the instinct to build cells; the spider furnished with the peculiar
   viscid matter, and apparatus for spinning it, makes a web and watches
   for its prey. So it is throughout all animated nature. Here then are
   two very distinct things: instinct and corporeal organs; the instinct
   cannot account for the organs nor the organs for the instinct; and yet
   they are never found the one without the other. They of necessity,
   therefore, imply an intelligence which implants the instinct and
   furnishes the appropriate organs.

   Argument from Prevision.

   4. There cannot be a more decisive proof of intelligence than
   prevision; preparation for an event in the future. The world is full of
   evidence of such prevision. It is seen not only in the preparation of
   the organs of sight, hearing, breathing, nutrition, etc. for
   necessities still future; but still more strikingly in the provision
   made for the support of young animals as soon as they are born. In the
   mammalia before the birth of the offspring, the breast or udder begins
   to swell; it commences the secretion of milk, so that the moment the
   young animal enters the world he finds prepared the most nutritious and
   suitable food the world contains. The egg furnishes a still more
   instructive illustration. It consists of albumen and the yolk. To the
   yolk is attached a minute germ or cell. When by heat the germ begins to
   develop, if nourishment were not provided and at hand, it would of
   necessity perish. But the yolk is there to supply the needed material
   out of which the future animal is fashioned. If this does not indicate
   a foreseeing mind and a providing power, then the most skilful
   productions of human skill and kindness do not prove the intelligence
   of man, Where then is this intelligence? Not in the parent bird, for it
   understands nothing about it. Not in mere blind forces of nature. There
   may possibly be room for question where to place it; but to deny that
   these provisions indicate an intelligent agency somewhere, is
   altogether irrational.

   Vegetable Organisms.

   5. The vegetable kingdom is as full of the indications of benevolent
   design as the animal. Plants have their organism and their physiology.
   Their structure, in their organs for growth and reproduction, is quite
   as marvellous as that of most species of the animal kingdom. They
   constitute an essential part in the great system of nature, without
   which there could be no sentient life on our globe. Animals cannot live
   on inorganic matter. It is the province of the plant to reduce this
   matter into such a state as to be fit for the support of animal life.
   If it were not therefore for the functions of the leaf which transmutes
   the inorganic into the organic, there could be no sentient life on our
   earth. Is there no design here? Is there no intelligent adaptation of
   one part of the great system of nature to another?

   From the Adaptations of Nature.

   6. This leads to another department of the subject. The evidences of
   design are not confined to the separate organs of the plant or animal;
   nor to the relations of these organs to each other, nor, in the case of
   animals, to the instinct which impels to the proper use of those
   organs; they are to be found just as abundantly in the adaptation of
   external nature to the necessities of animal and vegetable life.
   Neither plants nor animals could exist without light, air, heat, water,
   and soil, to produce the common food of all living things. Who created
   the light and heat and diffuses them over the whole earth? Who made the
   sun from which they radiate? Who constituted the atmosphere with its
   chemical adjustments, precisely what is necessary for the support of
   life, everywhere and always the same, and poured it round our globe?
   How is it that water at a certain temperature evaporates, rises in
   mist, is gathered into clouds, is carried everywhere by the winds, and
   falls in rain to fertilize the earth? The eye supposes light, as the
   lungs suppose air; the appetite of hunger supposes food, and the power
   of digestion. Food supposes soil, light, heat, and water. Surely this
   is one great system. There is unity and mutual relation in all its
   parts. It must have had one author, and He must be infinite in
   intelligence and goodness.

   All living Creatures on the Earth have Organic Relations.

   7. The design indicated in nature is, however, not confined to the
   individual organisms and to their relations to the world around them,
   but it has in the progress of science been discovered, that the whole
   vegetable and animal world has been constructed on one comprehensive
   plan. As there is a relation of one organ of a given plant or animal to
   all others and to the whole, so the whole race of plants, and the whole
   race of animals are related. There are certain typical forms of which
   all the infinite variety of plants are modifications; and certain other
   types of which the innumerable genera, species, and varieties of
   animals are only modifications; and these modifications are precisely
   of the kind to suit each species for its end, and for the circumstances
   in which it is to live. So obviously is this the case that Professor
   Agassiz's "Essay on Classification," is, to say the least, as strong an
   argument for the being of God as any of the "Bridgewater Treatises."
   And it is so regarded by its illustrious author. On page 10 of his
   "Contributions to the Natural History of the United States," he says,
   "I know those who hold it to be very unscientific to believe that
   thinking is not something inherent in matter, and that there is an
   essential difference between inorganic and living and thinking beings.
   I shall not be prevented by any such pretensions of a false philosophy
   from expressing my conviction that as long as it cannot be shown that
   matter or physical forces do actually reason, I shall consider any
   manifestation of thought as evidence of the existence of a thinking
   Being as the author of such thought, and shall look upon an intelligent
   and intelligible connection between the facts of nature as direct proof
   of the existence of a thinking God, as certainly as man exhibits the
   power of thinking, when he recognizes their natural relation."

   Evidence that the Earth was designed for Man.

   8. It is not only, however, the living organisms inhabiting our earth,
   which exhibit such evidence of an intelligent creator, but also the
   earth itself. If a father, who when he provides a home for his
   children, fits it up with all the necessities and all the luxuries
   which they can possibly need, gives indisputable evidence of
   intelligence and love, then are those attributes to be ascribed to Him
   who fitted up this world to be the home of his creatures. This is seen,
   as already intimated, in the constitution of the atmosphere, in the
   distribution of light and heat, of electricity and magnetism, in the
   establishment of those laws which secure the regular succession of the
   seasons, in the preparation of soil by the disintegration of rocks, the
   falling of rain, the deposition of dew which falls gently with
   life-giving power on the thirsty earth; in innumerable other provisions
   and dispositions of the forces of nature without which neither
   vegetable nor animal life could be sustained. There are many special
   provisions of this kind which fill the mind with gratitude and wonder.
   It is a general law that bodies contract as they become colder. Water,
   however, when it freezes expands and becomes lighter. If it were not
   for this benevolent exception to the general law, not only would the
   inhabitants of all our rivers perish, but the greater part of the
   temperate zone would be uninhabitable. It is no answer to this argument
   to say that there are a few other exceptions to this law. We may not
   know the final cause why bismuth should expand on cooling; but this
   does not prevent our knowing why ice is made lighter than water. Our
   not understanding one sentence in a book, does not prove that it has no
   meaning, nor that we cannot understand another sentence.

   The whole configuration of the earth, its position in relation to the
   sun, and the inclination of its axis, are obviously intended to render
   it a suitable residence for the creatures by which it is inhabited.
   Their well-being depends on the distribution of land and water on its
   surface; on the elevation of its mountain ranges and plateaus, and on
   the ocean currents which are determined by the configuration of its
   coasts. If North and South America were not connected by the narrow
   Isthmus of Darien, Great Britain and the northwestern portions of
   Europe would be uninhabitable. They owe the moderate temperature which
   they enjoy to the immense body of warm water, which is prevented by
   that Isthmus from flowing into the Pacific, being floated in a
   northeasterly direction across the Atlantic. When we see such
   benevolent arrangements among men, we refer them instinctively and by a
   rational necessity to a benevolent and intelligent agent. No rational
   ground exists for refusing to ascribe like arrangements in nature to a
   similar source. Is it any more an evidence of prudent or benevolent
   foresight that a man should store away abundant fuel for himself or
   others, knowing that winter is approaching, than that God has laid up
   inexhaustible stores of coal in the bowels of the earth, for the use of
   his children on the earth?

   Cosmical Arrangements.

   9. The argument for design founded on cosmical arrangements is so vast
   a subject that it seems absurd even to refer to it, in a single
   paragraph. The simple facts are, that our globe is one of eight primary
   planets which revolve round the sun. The most distant of these planets
   is some three thousand millions of miles from the central luminary.
   These planets all move in the same direction, in nearly circular
   orbits, in nearly the same plane, and with so equable a motion that
   each performs its revolutions in the proper time. The stability of the
   system depends on these circumstances. To secure these results matter
   must attract matter according to its quantity and the square of its
   distance. The central body must be of such mass as to hold the planets
   in their course. The centrifugal and centripetal forces must be exactly
   balanced, to prevent the planets from flying off into space, or falling
   into the sun. Each planet must have been projected with a precise
   definite velocity to secure its orbit being nearly a circle, rather
   than any other curve. The central body alone, in accordance with the
   evident plan, is luminous and heat-producing. All the others are opaque
   and cold. These are facts, which Sir Isaac Newton says he is "forced to
   ascribe to the counsel and contrivance of a voluntary agent." [155]
   Since the time of Newton, indeed, it has been the commonly received
   theory that the planets were at one time fluid, highly heated, and
   luminous; and that they have become opaque in the process of cooling.
   But this only puts the argument one step back. The fact is that a most
   wonderful and beneficent result has been accomplished. The question
   How? is of minor importance. It is the beneficence of the result which
   indicates mind, and this indication of mind implies a "voluntary
   agent."

   Our solar system itself, therefore, is vast, varied, and well ordered.
   Our system, however, is one of probably hundreds of millions. At least
   astronomers assert their knowledge of a hundred million of suns, some
   of which are incalculably larger than ours. Sirius is calculated to
   shine with a light equal to two hundred and fifty of our suns; Alcyone
   with that of twelve thousand suns. The nearest of these stars is
   separated from the outer planet of our system twenty-one billions of
   miles. These millions of stars are not scattered equally through space,
   but are gathered into groups, the members of which bear an obvious
   relation to each other.

   Besides these systems in which planets are assumed to revolve around
   suns, there are others in which suns revolve around suns, at distances
   proportioned to their magnitude. The light emanating from these great
   luminaries is of different colors, white, red, blue.

   Then more distant in space float the unresolved nebulæ. Whether these
   nebulæ are vast continents of stars too distant to be distinguishable,
   or cosmical matter in a formative state, is still an open question with
   astronomers. Two thousand have been counted in the northern hemisphere,
   and one thousand in the southern. They assume every variety of form;
   some are spherical, some fan-shaped, some spiral, some in circular
   rings. It is estimated that the light of some of the stars has been
   many thousand years in reaching our earth, although travelling at the
   rate of more than ten millions of miles a minute.

   Throughout this vast universe order reigns. In the midst of endless
   variety, there is unity. The same laws of gravitation, of light, and of
   heat everywhere prevail. Confusion and disorder are the uniform result
   of chance or blindly operating forces. Order is the sure indication of
   mind. What mind! what wisdom! what power! what beneficence! does this
   all but infinite universe display!

   "The result of our whole experience," said Sir Gilbert Eliot, writing
   to Hume himself, "seems to amount to this: -- There are but two ways in
   which we have ever observed the different parcels of matter to be
   thrown together, -- either at random, or with design and purpose. By
   the first, we have never seen produced a regular complicated effect,
   corresponding to a certain end; by the second, we uniformly have. If,
   then, the works of nature and the productions of men resemble each
   other in this one general characteristic, will not even experience
   sufficiently warrant us to ascribe to both a similar, though
   proportionable, cause." [156]

   This argument from design is constantly urged in the Old Testamcnt,
   which appeals to the heavens and the earth as revealing the being and
   perfections of God. The Apostle Paul says that the living God, who made
   heaven and earth, and the sea and all that is therein, hath not left
   himself without a witness. (Acts xiv. 15-17.) He demonstrated to the
   Athenians the nature of God from his works and from our relation to him
   as his offspring. (Acts xvii. 23-31.) To the Romans he said that the
   eternal power and Godhead of the Supreme Being, are clearly seen, being
   understood by the things that are made. (Rom. i. 20.) The ancient
   philosophers drew the same conclusion from the same premises.
   Anaxagoras argued that nous, mind, must be admitted as controlling
   everything in the world, because everything indicates design. Socrates
   constantly dwells on this as the great proof of the being of God.
   Cicero [157] says that it is as impossible that an ordered world could
   be formed by the fortuitous concurrence of atoms, as that a book should
   be composed by the throwing about letters at random. Trendelenburg,
   [158] after referring to that passage, says: "It is perhaps more
   difficult to assume, that by the blind combination of chemical and
   physical elements and forces, any one even of the organs of the body
   should be formed, -- the eye, for example, so clear, sharp, and
   all-seeing, -- much less the harmonious union of organs which make up
   the body, than that a book should be made by chance, by throwing types
   about."

   Philo presents the argument in its simplest syllogistic form. "No work
   of art is self-made. The world is the most perfect work of art.
   Therefore, the world was made by a good and most perfect Author. Thus
   we have the knowledge of the existence of God." [159] All the Christian
   fathers and subsequent theologians have reasoned in the same way. Even
   Kant, although denying its conclusiveness, says that the teleological
   argument should always be treated with respect. It is, he says, the
   oldest, the clearest, and the best adapted to the human mind.

   § 4. Objections to the Argument from Design.

   A. The Denial of Final Causes.

   The doctrine of final causes in nature must stand or fall with the
   doctrine of a personal God. The one cannot be denied without denying
   the other. And the admission of the one involves the admission of the
   other. By final cause is not meant a mere tendency, or the end to which
   events either actually or apparently tend; but the end contemplated in
   the use of means adapted to attain it. The contemplation of an end, is
   a mental act. The selection and use of means adapted to attain such
   end, are both intelligent and voluntary acts. But an intelligent
   voluntary agent is a person. [160] In other words, the use of means to
   accomplish a contemplated end is a function of personality, or at least
   of intelligent agency.

   Such being the nature of final causes, they are of course denied, (1.)
   By the positivist, who believes nothing but facts of which the senses
   take cognizance; and who admits of no other causation than regularity
   of sequence. As efficiency, intention, and mind are not perceived by
   the senses, they are not, and cannot be philosophically admitted. (2.)
   By those who, while they admit such a thing as force, and, therefore,
   in that sense, a cause, allow of no distinction between physical,
   vital, and mental causes, or forces; and who maintain that the one can
   be resolved into either of the others. The advocates of this theory
   make thought a product of the brain; and have as their watch-word,
   "Ohne Phosphor kein Gedanke." Of course phosphorus must be before
   thought, and therefore there can be no final cause in the production of
   phosphorus, or of anything else. (3.) Final causes are denied by those
   who regard the universe as the development of the infinite Being under
   the operation of necessary law. Of that Being no intelligence,
   consciousness, or will can be predicated. Consequently there can be no
   preconceived design to be accomplished, either by the universe as a
   whole, or any of its parts. According to Spinoza, therefore, final
   causes are "humana figmenta et deliria."

   If you should ask a peasant, where a tree or the body of an animal came
   from, he would probably answer, "Why, it grew." That for him is the
   final fact. And so it is for all the advocates of the above-named
   theories. Thus it is that extremes (the peasant's thought and the
   savant's theory) meet. What more, what deeper thought is found in the
   words of Stuart Mill than in the peasant's answer, when the logician
   says: "Sequences entirely physical and material, as soon as they had
   become sufficiently familiar to the human mind, came to be thought
   perfectly natural, and were regarded not only as needing no explanation
   themselves, but as being capable of affording it to others, and even of
   serving as the ultimate explanation of things in general." [161]

   B. Objections of Hume and Kant.

   Hume's answer to the argument from design, or final causes, is, that
   our knowledge is limited by experience. We have often seen houses,
   ships, engines, and other machines made, and therefore, when we see
   similar products of human skill we are authorized to infer that they
   too were constructed by an intelligent author. But the world belongs to
   an entirely different category; we have never seen a world made; and
   therefore we have no rational ground for assuming that this world had a
   maker. "When two species of objects," says Hume, [162] "have always
   been observed to be conjoined together, I can infer, by custom, the
   existence of one whenever I see the existence of the other, and this I
   call an argument from experience. But how this argument can have place,
   where the objects, as in the present case, are single, individual,
   without parallel, or specific resemblance, may be difficult to explain.
   And will any man tell me with a serious countenance, that an orderly
   universe must arise from some thought and art, like the human, because
   we have experience of it? To ascertain this reasoning, it were
   requisite that we had experience of the origin of worlds; and it is not
   sufficient surely that we have seen ships and cities arise from human
   art and contrivance." What experience teaches is that design implies
   intelligence; i.e., that we never see the adaptation of means to an end
   without having evidence that such adaptation is the work of an
   intelligent agent. And, therefore, even under the guidance of
   experience we infer that wherever we see design, whether in nature or
   in art, there must be an intelligent agent. But experience is not the
   ground or limit of this conviction. It is an intuitive truth,
   self-evident from its nature, that design cannot be accounted for on
   the ground of chance or necessity. Let any man try to persuade himself
   that a watch is the product of chance, and he will see how futile is
   the attempt.

   Kant presents substantially the same objection as Hume when he says
   that the concatenation of cause and effect is confined to the external
   world, and therefore that it is illogical to apply the principle of
   causation to account for the existence of the external world itself. He
   further objects that the evidences of design in nature would prove only
   a demiurgus, or world-builder, and not an extramundane God. It is
   further urged against the sufficiency of the teleological argument,
   that even if it proved the author of the world to be distinct from it,
   it would not prove him to be infinite, because the world is finite, and
   we cannot infer an infinite cause from a finite effect.

   Answer to the Objections.

   In answer to these objections it may be remarked that what the argument
   from design is intended to prove, and what it does prove, is, (1.) That
   the Author of the universe is an intelligent and voluntary agent. (2.)
   That He is extramundane and not merely the life, or soul of the world,
   for the design is shown not simply or chiefly by the moulding of
   organized bodies by a principle acting from within outward; but by the
   adaptation of things external to such organisms, to their various
   necessities; and by the disposition and orderly arrangement of immense
   bodies of matter, separated by millions, or even billions of miles.
   (3.) The immensity of the universe through the whole of which design is
   manifest, proves that its cause must be adequate to the production of
   such an effect; and if the effect be, as it is to us, incomprehensibly
   great, the cause must be so also. And incomprehensibly great and
   infinitely great, are practically equivalent. But besides, the
   cosmological argument proves that God is not only maker, but creator.
   And creation implies the possession of infinite power. Not only because
   the difference between existence and non-existence is infinite, but
   because in Scripture creation is always represented as the peculiar
   work of the infinite God. So far as we know all creature power is
   limited to self-action, or to the more or less limited control of what
   already exists.

   What has already been said may be a sufficient answer to the objection
   that while design does indeed prove intelligence, yet that intelligence
   may be in matter itself, or in nature (a vis insita), as in the soul of
   the world. These points, as they are generally presented, concern more
   properly the relation of God to the world, than his existence. They
   involve the admission of the existence of an intelligence somewhere,
   adequate to account for all the phenomena of the universe. They involve
   consequently the denial that these phenomena are to be referred either
   to chance, or the action of mere physical laws. Where that intelligence
   is placed, is not the question. Wherever placed it must be a person;
   and not merely an unintelligent force acting according to necessary
   law. For the evidence of voluntary action and of benevolence is as
   clear as that of intelligence. And the considerations already urged
   prove that this voluntary, intelligent Being must be extramundane; a
   conclusion which is rendered still more evident from our relation to
   Him as responsible and dependent.

   C. Miscellaneous Objections.

   1. It is objected that both in the vegetable and animal kingdoms there
   are malformations, abnormal productions, which are inconsistent with
   the idea of the control of an infinite intelligence. This is at best
   merely an argument from our ignorance. Admitting that there are in
   nature some things which we cannot account for, this does not
   invalidate the argument drawn from the innumerable cases of benevolent
   design. If Mr. Babbage's calculating machine should once in many
   million of times present the wrong number, this would not prove that
   there was no intelligence manifested in its construction. It is not
   necessary even to assume that such apparently irregular action is to be
   referred to the imperfection of the machine. For what we know, its
   maker may have a reason for such action, which we cannot discover. In
   every extended piece of music, discords here and there occur, which
   pain the ear, and which those unskilled in music cannot account for,
   but which the competently instructed perceive are taken up and resolved
   into a higher harmony. If a prince should give us a chest containing
   millions in coin and jewels, we should not question his kind intention,
   even should we find among them a spurious dime for whose presence we
   could not account. It would be insane to reject the Bible with all its
   sublime and saving truths, because there may be in it a few passages
   which we cannot understand, and which in themselves seem inconsistent
   with the perfection of its author. No man refuses to believe in the sun
   and to rejoice in its light because there are dark spots on its surface
   for which he cannot account. Ignorance is a very healthful condition of
   our present state of being.

   Useless Organs.

   2. A second objection of much the same kind is founded on the fact that
   we find members in organized bodies for which they have no use. For
   example, men have mammæ; the whale has teeth which are never developed
   and which the animal does not need; animals have bones which they never
   use; birds and crocodiles have their skulls formed of separate bones as
   well as viviparous animals, although in their case there seems to be no
   utility in such arrangement. Even Professor Owen urges this objection.
   In his work on "Limbs," [163] he says, "I think it will be obvious that
   the principle of final adaptation fails to satisfy all the conditions
   of the problem. That every segment and almost every bone which is
   present in the human hand and arm should exist in the fin of the
   whale," where they are not needed, does not appear consistent with the
   principle. Again, in another place, he says, [164] "The cranium of the
   bird, which is composed in the adult of a single bone, is ossified from
   the same number of points as in the human embryo, without the
   possibility of a similar purpose being subserved thereby, in the
   extrication of the chick from the fractured egg-shell . . . . These,
   and a hundred such facts force upon the contemplative anatomist the
   inadequacy of the teleological hypothesis."

   On this it may be remarked: (1.) That the objection bears only on the
   individual organism of plants or animals, whereas the evidences of
   design are scattered over the whole universe. (2.) This objection also
   is founded on our ignorance. The argument is that because we cannot see
   the reason for a certain arrangement, no such reason exists. (3.) It
   takes the lowest view of utility, namely, that which contemplates the
   immediate wants of the individual organism. Things which are not needed
   for its necessities may answer a much higher end. In a great building
   use is not the only end contemplated; there are symmetry and unity,
   æsthetic ends of as much value as mere comfort or convenience.
   Scientific men have demonstrated that all animals are in their
   structure only modifications of four typical forms. These forms are
   preserved in all the genera and species included under these general
   classes. The presence therefore, of these characteristic features of
   the type, even where not needed for the individual, serve to indicate
   the unity of the plan on which the whole animal kingdom is constructed
   We must remember that what we do not see, cannot disprove the realty of
   what we do see.

   Instinct.

   3. A third objection is sometimes derived from the operations of
   Instinct. Instinct, according to Dr. Reid, is "a natural blind impulse
   to certain actions, without having any end in view, without
   deliberation, and very often without any conception of what we do."
   [165] Dr. Whately also says: "An instinct is a blind tendency to a mode
   of action independent of any consideration on the part of the agent, of
   the end to which the action leads." Paley defines it to be "a
   propensity prior to experience and independent of instruction." [166]
   The argument is that as "a blind impulse" contemplating no end, effects
   all the marvellous contrivances which we see in the works of irrational
   animals, similar contrivances in nature cannot prove intelligence in
   the author of nature. The answer to this argument is: --

   1. That it is founded on a wrong definition of instinct. It is not a
   blind impulse. It is that measure of intelligence given to animals
   which enables them to sustain their lives, to continue their race, and
   to answer the necessities of their being. Within certain limits this
   form of intelligence, both in man and in irrational animals, acts
   blindly. The impulse which leads the young of all animals to seek their
   nourishment in the appropriate way and in the proper place, is no doubt
   blind. The same is also probably true of the impulse which leads many
   animals to make provision in summer for the necessities of winter.
   Neither can it be supposed that the bee has always and everywhere
   constructed its cell according to the nicest mathematical principles,
   under the guidance of an intelligent apprehension of those principles.
   These operations which are performed without instructions, and always
   from age to age in the same way, indicate a guidance which may be
   called blind in so far that those under its influence do not devise the
   plan on which they act, although they may know the end they have in
   view. But the intelligence of animals goes far beyond these narrow
   limits. Not only does the beaver construct his dam according to the
   nature of the locality and the force of the stream on which he fixes
   his habitations, but we constantly see it, as well as other animals,
   varying its mode of operation to suit special emergencies. Instinct,
   therefore, as designating the principle which controls the action of
   irrational animals, is not blind, but intelligent. It admits of the
   contemplation of an end, and of the selection and application of means
   appropriate for its accomplishment. Even admitting, therefore, that the
   intelligence manifested in nature is of the same kind as that
   manifested by animals, yet the difference in degree is infinite.

   2. No measure, however, of intellect of the grade or character of
   instinct is sufficient to account for the phenomena of the universe.
   Instinct is concerned with the wants of individual organism. But who
   adapts the organs of an animal to its instincts? Who adapts external
   nature, air, light, heat, water, food, etc., etc., to its necessities?
   What relation has instinct to the stellar universe?

   3. Moreover, these instincts themselves are among the phenomena to be
   accounted for. If they are blind impulses, can they be accounted for,
   in all their variety and in all their accommodation to the nature and
   wants of animals, by a blind impulse pervading all things? The fact is
   that the adaptation of external nature to the instincts of the
   different classes of animals, and of their instincts to external
   nature, affords one of the most convincing proofs of an intellect
   exterior to both, and ordering the one in relation to the other.

   4. It is to be remembered, although the topic of a separate argument,
   that the soul of man with all its wonderful powers and capacities,
   intellectual, moral, and religious, is one of the facts to be accounted
   for. To trace the existence of the soul of man to "a blind impulse," is
   to assume that the effect immeasurably transcends its cause, which is
   assuming an effect without a cause.

   5. All these objections take for granted the eternal existence of
   matter, and the eternity of physical forces. As these are, they must
   have existed from eternity, or have begun to be. If they began to be
   they must have had a cause outside of themselves. That cause cannot be
   nonentity. It must be a self-existing, eternal substance, having the
   intelligence, power, will, and benevolence adequate to account for the
   universe and all that it contains. That is, the cause of the universe
   must be a personal God.

   § 5. The Moral, or Anthropological Argument.

   A. Nature of the Argument.

   As the image of the sun reflected from a mirror, or the smooth surface
   of a lake, reveals to us that the sun is, and what it is; so the soul
   of man, just as clearly, and just as certainly, reveals that God is and
   what He is. The reflection of the sun does not teach us everything that
   is true concerning that luminary; it does not reveal its internal
   constitution, nor tell us how its light and heat are maintained from
   age to age. In like manner the soul, as the image of God, does not
   reveal all that God is. In both cases, and equally in both cases, what
   is revealed is true, that is, trustworthy.

   It answers to the objective reality. As we know that the sun really is
   what its reflection represents him as being, so we know that God is
   what the nature of the human soul declares Him to be. Doubt in the one
   case is just as unreasonable, and we may say, just as impossible as in
   the other.

   It has been shown in the preceding chapter that every human has in his
   own nature the evidence of the existence of God, an evidence which
   never can be obliterated, and which will force conviction on the most
   unwilling. It is no less true that every man has in himself the same
   irresistible evidence that God is an extramundane personal Being; that
   He is intelligent, voluntary, and moral; that He knows; that He has the
   right to command; and that He can punish and can save.

   It may naturally be asked, If this be so; if every man has in his own
   nature a witness whose competency he cannot question, and whose
   testimony he cannot ignore, What is the use of arguing about the
   matter? For three reasons, first, because even self-evident truths are
   often denied; and secondly, because men, in their present moral state,
   are under a strong temptation to deny the existence of a holy and just
   God; and thirdly, because efforts are constantly made to pervert or
   contradict the testimony of our nature to the existence and nature of
   God.

   B. Argument from the Existence of the Mind.

   Every man has in his own consciousness the evidence of the existence of
   mind. He knows that he is an intelligent, personal being. He knows that
   his personality does not reside in his body, but in his soul. It is
   included in the facts of consciousness that the soul and body are
   distinct, that they are different substances having not only different
   but incompatible attributes. That such is the general conviction of men
   is plain from all languages recognizing the distinction; and from the
   fact that it is never denied except by speculative or theoretical
   writers. The common consciousness of men as revealed by their forms of
   speech, and by their avowals, and by the universal belief, in some
   form, of a state of conscious existence after death, bears witness to
   the truth that the soul is something different from, and far superior
   to the body. How is the existence of this immaterial, thinking,
   immortal substance which we call self, to be accounted for? That it has
   not always existed is undeniable. If it began to be, it must have the
   cause of its existence out of itself. That cause cannot be the soul of
   the parent, for that also is an effect. It began to be. And it is
   universally admitted that an infinite series of effects is unthinkable.
   If the soul cannot be accounted for by derivation in unending series of
   steps from those who preceded us, neither can it be conceived of as a
   product of the body, or of physical forces and combinations. It would
   seem to be a self-evident proposition, that the effect cannot contain
   in it more than is in its cause; that intelligence cannot be the
   product of what is unintelligent. This also is confirmed by all
   experience.

   We are conversant in our present state, first, with matter, with its
   properties and laws or forces; secondly, with vegetable life; thirdly,
   with animal life; and fourthly, with mind, endowed with a life of a
   much higher order. These different elements, or kinds of existence,
   although marvellously combined and intermingled, are distinct. As a
   fact of experience, mere matter with its physical forces never
   originates vegetable life; vegetable life of itself never originates or
   passes over into animal life; and animal life never originates, and is
   never developed into intellectual or spiritual life. There is an
   impassable gulf between these several departments of being. As soon as
   the principle of life leaves a plant or animal, the physical forces
   belonging to matter work its dissolution. These are facts indelibly
   impressed on the convictions of the mass of mankind. They are
   conclusions to which universal experience has led the minds of all men.
   They are indeed denied by certain scientific men; but the theory on
   which that denial is founded involves the denial of so many intuitive
   and necessary truths; it does such violence to the laws of belief
   impressed upon our nature, and on the validity of which all knowledge
   depends, that it can never be more than a precarious and temporary
   belief on the part of those who adopt it, and can never have control
   over the minds of men. This is not the place to enter upon the
   discussion of the theory of materialism. We have a right to appeal to
   the general conviction of mankind that mind cannot be the product of
   matter. If this be so, as our minds are not self-existent and eternal,
   it must be true, as even the heathen believed, that our spirits owe
   their existence to Him who is the Father of spirits.

   C. From the Nature of the Soul.

   There are two laws, or general facts, which seem to characterize all
   the works of nature. By nature is here meant all things out of God. The
   first of these laws is, that whatever capacities, necessities, or
   desires exist, or are found in any organism, adequate provision is made
   to meet and satisfy them all. This is obviously true with regard to the
   vegetable world. Plants have organs for the selection of the materials
   necessary for their growth and maturity, from the soil; organs for the
   absorption of carbon from the atmosphere; the capacity of being
   appropriately affected by light and heat; organs of propagation
   designed for the continuance of each after its kind. All these
   necessities are met. Soil, atmosphere, light, heat, and water, are all
   provided. The same is no less true with regard to the animal world in
   all its endless variety of forms. Food, light, heat, air, and water,
   are suited to their several necessities to their organs, and to their
   instincts. If they have the appetite of hunger, they have organs for
   the appropriation of their food, and for its digestion; the instinct
   for its selection, and food suited to each, is ever at hand. So of all
   the other necessities of their nature.

   The second law, or general fact is, that all these living organisms
   reach perfection, and fully accomplish the end of their being. That is,
   they become all they are capable of being. All that belongs to their
   nature is fully developed. All their capacities are fully exercised,
   and all their wants fully satisfied.

   These two things are true of every living creature within the compass
   of human knowledge, except Man. So far as his body is concerned, they
   are true in regard to him also. His physical necessities are all met by
   the present circumstances of his being. His body becomes all that it is
   capable of being, in this stage of existence. But these things are not
   true with regard to his soul. It has capacities which are not fully
   developed in this world, and never can be. It has desires, aspirations,
   and necessities for which the world does not furnish the appropriate
   objects. It is, therefore, as evidently designed and adapted for a
   higher and spiritual state of existence, as his body is adapted to the
   present order of things. The soul of man has, in the first place,
   intellectual powers capable of indefinite expansion, which in this
   world never reach their utmost limit. With these is connected a desire
   of knowledge which is never satisfied. In the second place, the soul of
   man has a capacity for happiness which nothing in the world, nor the
   whole world could it be attained, can by possibility fill. The animal
   is satisfied. Its capacity for happiness is here fully provided for. In
   the third place, the soul has aspirations to which nothing in this life
   corresponds. It longs for fellowship with what is far above itself;
   what is boundless, and eternal. In the fourth place, with all these
   powers, desires, and aspirations, it is conscious of its weakness,
   insufficiency, and dependence. It must have an object to worship, to
   love, to trust; a Being who can satisfy all its necessities, and under
   whose guardianship it can be safe from those powers of evil to which it
   knows that it is on all sides and at all times exposed; a Being whose
   existence, and whose relation to itself, can explain all the mysteries
   of its own being, and secure its felicity in the future, on which it
   knows it must soon enter. Just as certainly as hunger in the animal
   supposes that there is food adapted to still its cravings, so certainly
   does this hunger of the soul suppose that there is some Being in the
   universe to satisfy its necessities. In both cases the craving is
   natural, universal, and imperative.

   It cannot be that man is an exception to the laws above-mentioned; that
   he alone, of all that lives, has capacities, desires, necessities, for
   which no provision has been made. God is the correlative of man, in the
   sense that the existence of such a creature as man necessitates the
   assumption of such a Being as God.

   D. From the Moral Nature of Man.

   The familiar facts of consciousness on this subject are, --

   1. That we have, by the constitution of our nature, a sense of right
   and wrong; we perceive or judge some things to be right, and others to
   be wrong. This perception is immediate. As the reason perceives some
   things to be true, and others false; and as the senses take immediate
   knowledge of their appropriate objects, so the soul takes immediate
   cognizance of the moral character of feelings and acts. The reason, the
   senses, and the conscience are alike infallible within certain limits,
   and liable to error beyond those limits.

   2. Our moral perceptions or judgments are sui generis. They have their
   peculiar, distinctive character, which belongs to no other of our
   states of consciousness. The right is as distinct from the true, the
   proper, the agreeable, or the expedient, as these latter are from our
   sensations. The right is that which we are bound to do and to approve;
   the wrong is that which we are bound to avoid and to disapprove. Moral
   obligation, as expressed by the word "ought," is a simple and primary
   idea. It can be understood only by those who have felt it. And it can
   be confounded with nothing else.

   3. These moral judgments are independent. They are not under the
   control of the understanding of of the will. No man can will to regard
   an axiom as false, or think that black is white, or white black. Nor
   can any sophistry of the understanding lead him to such false judgment.
   In like manner, no man can will to believe that to be right which his
   conscience tells him to be wrong; nor can he argue himself into the
   conviction that he has done right, when his conscience tells him he has
   done wrong.

   4. Our moral judgments, or, in other words, the conscience, has an
   authority from which we cannot emancipate ourselves. We can neither
   deny nor ignore it. It has a lordship. It commands, and it forbids. And
   we are bound to obey. It has power also to enforce its decisions. It
   can reward and punish. Its rewards are among the greatest blessings we
   can enjoy. Its punishments are the most intolerable agony the human
   soul can endure.

   5. Our moral judgments involve the idea of law, i.e., of a rule or
   standard to which we are bound to be conformed. When we judge a thing
   to be right, we judge it to be conformed to the moral law; when we
   judge it to be wrong, we judge that is not conformed to that law.

   6. This law has an authority which it does not derive from us. It is
   essentially different from a sense of propriety, or perception of
   expediency. It is something imposed upon us, and to which we are
   required to be conformed by an authority out of ourselves.

   7. Our moral nature involves, therefore, a sense of responsibility. We
   must answer for what we are, and for what we do. This responsibility is
   not to ourselves, not to society, nor to being in general. It must be
   to a person; that is, to a Being who knows what we are, what we do, and
   what we ought to be and do; who approves of the right, and disapproves
   of the wrong; and who has the power and the purpose to reward and
   punish us according to our character and conduct. Sin, from its very
   nature, as it reveals itself in our consciousness, involves not only a
   sense of pollution, or moral degradation, but also a sense of guilt;
   i.e., a conviction that we deserve punishment, that we ought to be
   punished, and, therefore, that punishment is inevitable.

   If such be the facts of our moral nature, it is plain that we are under
   the necessity of assuming the existence of an extramundane, personal
   God, on whom we are dependent, and to whom we are responsible. This is
   undoubtedly the ground for the conviction of the being of God, which
   has universally prevailed among men. Having the idea given in the
   constitution of their nature, or being under an inward necessity of
   believing in such a Being, cultivated men have sought and found
   evidence of his existence in the world without them. But these external
   proofs have neither been as general nor as operative as those derived
   from what we ourselves are, and from what we know that we deserve. Such
   men, therefore, as Kant, and Sir William Hamilton, while denying the
   validity of all other arguments for the existence of God, admit that
   our nature forces us to believe that He is, and that He is a person.

   Our Moral Feelings not due to Education.

   It is indeed objected that these phenomena of our moral nature are due
   to education or to superstition. To this it is answered, first, that
   moral truths have a self-evidencing light. They can no more be denied
   than the intuitions of sense and reason. It may even be said that our
   moral judgments have greater certainty than any other of our
   convictions. Men believe absurdities. They believe what contradicts the
   evidence of their senses. But no man ever has, or ever can believe that
   malignity is a virtue. In the second place, what is universal cannot be
   accounted for by peculiarities of culture. All men are moral beings;
   all have this sense of moral obligation, and of responsibility; and no
   man can free himself from these convictions. The Apostle, therefore,
   speaking out of the common consciousness of men, as well as under the
   guidance of the Holy Spirit, speaks of sinners as "knowing the judgment
   of God" (Rom i. 32); that is, a sense of sin involves the knowledge of
   a righteous God.

   We then are placed in the midst of a vast universe, of which we
   constitute a part. We are forced not merely by the desire of knowledge,
   but from the necessities of our nature, to ask, How did this universe
   originate? How is it sustained? To what does it tend? What are we?
   Whence did we come? Whither are we going? These questions must be
   answered. This complicated problem must be solved. To refer everything
   to chance, is no solution. It is a frivolous denial that any solution
   is necessary, that such questions need any answer. To refer everything
   to necessity, is to say that the existence of things as they are is the
   ultimate fact. The universe is, and always has been, and always must
   be. It is the evolution of necessary being by necessary laws. This is
   all we can know, and all that need be known. This, however, is no
   solution. It is merely the denial that any solution is possible. Could
   this theory be accepted with regard to the outward world, it leaves all
   the phenomena of man's nature -- intellectual, moral, and religious --
   unaccounted for. Theism is a solution. It assumes the existence of an
   eternal and necessary Being; a Spirit, and therefore intelligent,
   voluntary, self-conscious, and endowed with moral perfections. This
   hypothesis accounts for the origin of the universe. "In the beginning
   God created the heaven and the earth." This is a satisfactory answer to
   the first question. It accounts for all the universe is, its immensity,
   its variety, its order, its numberless organisms, the adaptation of
   external nature to the wants of all living things. It accounts for the
   nature of man. It gives what that nature demands, -- an infinite object
   of love, confidence, and adoration. It reveals who it is to whom we are
   responsible, and on whom we are dependent. We know that this solution
   is true, because it is a solution. It meets all the facts of the case.
   And it so meets them that it cannot fail to be accepted as true, either
   intelligently or blindly. The God whom all men ignorantly worship, the
   Scriptures reveal, not only in the certainty of his existence, but in
   the plenitude of his perfections.

CHAPTER III.

  ANTI-THEISTIC THEORIES.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. What is meant by Anti-Theism.

   As Theism is the doctrine of an extramundane, personal God, the
   creator, preserver, and governor of all things, any doctrine which
   denies the existence of such a Being is anti-theistic. Not only avowed
   Atheism, therefore, but Polytheism, Hylozoism, Materialism, and
   Pantheism, belong to the class of anti-theistic theories.

   Atheism.

   Atheism does not call for any separate discussion. It is in itself
   purely negative. It affirms nothing. It simply denies what Theism
   asserts. The proof of Theism is, therefore, the refutation of Atheism.
   Atheist is, however, a term of reproach. Few men are willing to call
   themselves, or to allow others to call them by that name. Hume, we
   know, resented it. Hence those who are really atheists, according to
   the etymological and commonly received meaning of the word, repudiate
   the term. They claim to be believers in God, although they assign to
   that word a meaning which is entirely unauthorized by usage. Thus
   Helvetius [167] says, "There is no man of understanding who does not
   admit an active principle in nature; therefore there is no atheist. He
   is not an atheist who says that motion is God; because in fact motion
   is incomprehensible, as we have no clear idea of it, because it only
   manifests itself by its effects, and by it all things are performed in
   the universe. Cousin [168] says, "Atheism is impossible, because the
   existence of God is implied in every affirmation. If a man believes
   that he exists, he must believe in the power of thought, and that is
   God." In like manner Herbert Spencer claims to be religious. He does
   not oppose religion, but dogmas. He acknowledges inscrutable power. He
   reduces all our knowledge to the two facts, "That force is," and "Force
   is persistent." Force, however, is perfectly inscrutable and
   incomprehensible. On this principle he attempts to reconcile religion
   and science. The ultimate principle of religion, that in which all
   religions agree, is that there is an inscrutable power which is the
   cause of all things. This also is the ultimate principle of science.
   They have therefore a common ground. Nothing can be predicated of this
   cause; not consciousness; not intelligence; not will; only that it is a
   force. This is all the God the new philosophy leaves us. [169]

   Language, however, has its rights. The meaning of words cannot be
   changed at the pleasure of individuals. The word God, and its
   equivalents in other languages, have a definite meaning, from which no
   man is at liberty to depart. If any one says he believes in God, he
   says he believes in the existence of a personal, self-conscious being.
   He does not believe in God, if he only believes in "motion," in
   "force," in "thought," in "moral order," in "the incomprehensible," or
   in any other abstraction.

   Theists also have their rights. Theism is a definite form of belief.
   For the expression of that belief, the word Theism is the established
   and universally recognized term. We have the right to retain it; and we
   have the right to designate as Atheism, all forms of doctrine which
   involve the denial of what is universally understood by Theism.

   Is Atheism possible?

   The question has often been discussed, Whether Atheism is possible? The
   answer to the question depends on the meaning of the term. If the
   question be, Whether a man can emancipate himself from the conviction
   that there is a personal Being to whom he is responsible for his
   character and conduct, and who will punish him for his sins? it must be
   answered in the negative. For that would be to emancipate himself from
   the moral law, which is impossible. If, however, the question means,
   Whether a man may, by speculation or otherwise, bring himself into such
   a state as to lose the consciousness of the belief of God as written in
   his heart, and free himself, for a time, from its power? it must be
   answered affirmatively. A man may, in this sense, deny his
   individuality or identity; the real, objective existence of soul or
   body, mind or matter; the distinction between right and wrong. But this
   is unnatural, and cannot last. It is like deflecting a spring by force.
   The moment the force is removed, the spring returns to its normal
   position. Men, therefore, often pass in a moment from a state of entire
   skepticism to a state of unquestioning faith; not of course by a
   process of argument, but by a change in their inward state. This
   transition from unbelief to faith, though thus sudden, and although not
   produced by an intellectual process, is perfectly rational. The
   feelings which rise in the mind contain evidence of the truth which the
   understanding cannot resist. It is also a familiar psychological fact,
   that skepticism and faith may, in a certain sense, coexist in the mind.
   An idealist while abiding by his theory has nevertheless an inward
   conviction of the reality of the external world. So the speculative
   atheist lives with the abiding conviction that there is a God to whom
   he must render an account.

   § 2. Polytheism.

   As the word implies, Polytheism is the theory which assumes the
   existence of many gods. Monotheism was the original religion of our
   race. This is evident not only from the teachings of the Scriptures,
   but also from the fact that the earliest historical form of religious
   belief is monotheistic. There are monotheistic hymns in the Vedas, the
   most ancient writings now extant, unless the Pentateuch be an
   exception.

   The first departure from monotheism seems to have been nature worship.
   As men lost the knowledge of God as creator, they were led to reverence
   the physical elements with which they were in conflict, whose power
   they witnessed, and whose beneficent influence they constantly
   experienced. Hence not only the sun, moon, and stars, the great
   representatives of nature, but fire, air, and water, became the objects
   of popular worship. We accordingly find that the Vedas consist largely
   of hymns addressed to these natural elements.

   These powers were personified, and soon it came to be generally
   believed that a personal being presided over each. And these imaginary
   beings were the objects of popular worship.

   While the mass of the people really believed in beings that were
   "called gods" (1 Cor. viii. 5), many of the more enlightened were
   monotheists, and more were pantheists. The early introduction and wide
   dissemination of pantheism are proved from the fact that it lies at the
   foundation of Brahminism and Buddhism, the religions of the larger part
   of the human race for thousands of years.

   There can be little doubt that when the Aryan tribes entered India,
   fifteen hundred or two thousand years before Christ, pantheism was
   their established belief. The unknown, and "unconditioned" infinite
   Being, reveals itself according to the Hindu system, as Brahma, Vishnu,
   and Shiva, -- that is, as Creator, Preserver, and Restorer. These were
   not persons, but modes of manifestation. It was in this form that the
   idea of an endless process of development of the infinite into the
   finite, and of the return of the finite into the infinite, was
   expressed. It was from this pantheistic principle that the endless
   polytheism of the Hindus naturally developed itself; and this
   determined the character of their whole religion. As all that is, is
   only a manifestation of God, everything remarkable, and especially the
   appearance of any remarkable man, was regarded as an "avatar," or
   incarnation of God, in one or other of his modes of manifestation, as
   Brahma, Vishnu, or Shiva. And as evil is as actual as good, the one is
   as much a manifestation, or, modus existendi, of the infinite Being as
   the other. And hence there are evil gods as well as good. In no part of
   the world has pantheism had such a field for development as in India,
   and nowhere has it brought forth its legitimate effects in such a
   portentous amount of evil. Nowhere has polytheism been carried to such
   revolting extremes.

   Among the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans polytheism assumed a form
   determined by the character of the people. The Greeks rendered it
   bright, beautiful, and sensual; the Romans were more decorous and
   sedate. Among barbarous nations it has assumed forms much more simple,
   and in many cases more rational.

   In the Bible the gods of the heathen are declared to be "vanity," and
   "nothing," mere imaginary beings, without power either to hurt or to
   save. (Jer. ii. 28; Isa. xli. 29; xlii. 17; Ps. cvi. 28.) They arc also
   represented as daimonia (1 Cor. x. 20). This word may express either an
   imaginary, or a real existence. The objects of heathen worship are
   called gods, even when declared to be nonentities. So they may be
   called "demons," without intending to teach that they are "spirits." As
   the word, however, generally in the New Testament, does mean "evil
   spirits," it is perhaps better to take it in that sense when it refers
   to the objects of heathen worship. This is not inconsistent with the
   doctrine that the gods of the heathen are "vanities and lies." They are
   not what men take them to be. They have no divine power. Paul says of
   the heathen before their conversion, "edouleusate tois phusei me ousi
   theois" (Gal. iv. 8). The prevalence and persistency of Polytheism show
   that it must have a strong affinity with fallen human nature. Although,
   except in pantheism, it has no philosophical basis, it constitutes a
   formidable obstacle to the progress of true religion in the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 3. Hylozoism.

   Hylozoism, from hule, matter, and zoe, life, is properly the doctrine
   that matter is endued with life. And this is the form in which the
   doctrine was held by many of its advocates. All matter, and every
   particle of matter, besides its physical properties, has a principle of
   life in itself, which precludes the necessity of assuming any other
   cause for the phenomena of life exhibited in the world. In this form
   Hylozoism does not differ from Materialism.

   Most commonly, however, the term is used to designate a system which
   admits a distinction between mind and matter, but considers them as
   intimately and inseparably united, as the soul and body in man. God,
   according to this view, is the soul of the world; an intelligent power
   everywhere present, to which are to be referred all the manifestations
   of design in the external world, and all the activity of the human
   soul. The relation, however, of the soul to the body, is a very
   imperfect illustration of the relation of God to the world according to
   the hylozoistic system. The soul is really exterior to the body, and
   independent of it, at least for its existence and activity. It is not
   the life of the body. It neither fashions nor preserves it. It is not
   even conscious of the vital activity by which the body is developed and
   sustained. Whereas according to the hylozoistic theory, the soul of the
   world is its plastic principle, the inward source of all its
   organizations and of all its activities.

   The leading principles of this theory as developed by the Stoics are,
   (1.) There are two constituent principles of the universe, one active,
   the other passive. The passive principle is matter, without form and
   without properties, i.e., inert. The active principle is mind, dwelling
   in matter its organizing formative power, i.e., God. (2.) The universe
   is therefore to be viewed under three aspects: (a.) As the all-forming
   power; the natura naturans, or, he phusis technike. (b.) The world as
   formed by this living, inward principle. The living kosmos, or natura
   naturata. (c.) The identity of the two, as they form one whole. It is
   only by an act of the mind that the one is distinguished from the
   other. Therefore the world, as including both, or as the identity of
   both, is formed with the greatest wisdom, and by a necessary process,
   for the laws of nature are the laws of reason. Cicero, [170] expounding
   this system, says, "Natura, non artificiosa solum, sed plane artifex ab
   eodem Zenone dicitur; consultrix, et provida utilitatum
   opportunitatumque omnium. Censet [Zeno] enim artis maxime proprium est
   creare et gignere, quodque in operibus nostrarum artium manus officiet
   id multo artificiosius naturam officere."

   (3.) The universe, therefore (The All-one), of which God is the soul
   and Nature the body, is living, immortal, rational, and perfect (zoon
   athanaton, logikon, teleion). God, as the controlling, operative
   principle in all things, acts according to necessary although rational
   laws. (4.) The souls of men are of the same nature with the soul of the
   world, but as individual existences, passing away when the life of the
   body ceases. (5.) The highest end of life is virtue; and virtue is
   living according to reason. [171]

   This system in one of its forms is nearly identical with Materialism,
   and in the other with Pantheism. There is no personal God to whom we
   are responsible, no freedom of the will; therefore, no sin, and no
   conscious existence after death.

   § 4. Materialism.

   Materialism is that system which ignores the distinction between matter
   and mind, and refers all the phenomena of the world, whether physical,
   vital, or mental, to the functions of matter.

   A. The Doctrine of Epicurus.

   Epicurus taught, (1.) That as ex nihilo nihil fit, the universe has
   always existed, and must continue to exist forever. (2.) That space,
   and the number of bodies which it contains, are infinite. (3.) These
   bodies are of two kinds, simple and compound. The simple bodies are
   atoms possessing form, magnitude, and weight. They are indivisible,
   unalterable, and indestructible. This is also the doctrine of modern
   science. Faraday [172] says, "A particle of oxygen is ever a particle
   of oxygen, -- nothing can in the least wear it. If it enters into
   combination, and disappears as oxygen; if it pass through a thousand
   combinations, animal, vegetable, and mineral -- if it lie hid for a
   thousand years, and then be evolved, it is oxygen with its first
   qualities, neither more nor less. It has all its original force, and
   only that; the amount of force which it disengaged when hiding itself,
   has again to be employed in a reverse direction when it is set at
   liberty." (4.) These atoms have their peculiar forces, distinct from
   their mere gravity. This, too, is the doctrine of modern science. It is
   included in what Faraday says in the passage just quoted. "Molecules,"
   say the scientific men of our day, "have been endowed with forces which
   give rise to various chemical qualities, and these never change either
   in their nature or in their amount." [173] (5.) Epicurus taught that
   the quantity of matter, and of course the amount of force in the world,
   is always the same. Neither can be increased or diminished. (6.) The
   atoms, of which the number is infinite, move through space with
   incredible velocity under the guidance of necessary physical laws. (7.)
   By the combination of these atoms under the influence of gravity and
   other physical forces, the universe was formed, and became a cosmos.
   This is very nearly the nebular hypothesis. (8.) The soul is material;
   or, in other words, all mental phenomena are due to the properties of
   matter. This, also, is proclaimed as the last result of modern science.
   (9.) The soul, of course, ceases to exist when the body dies; i.e., as
   death is the cessation of the vital, so it is also of the intellectual
   functions of the individual. The atoms of which the man is composed,
   with the forces which belong to them, continue to exist, and may enter
   into the composition of other men. But the man, as an individual,
   ceases to exist. This, almost in so many words, is the avowed doctrine
   of many physicists of the present day. (10.) Sensation is for us the
   only source of knowledge. By remembering former sensations, we form
   ideas, and by the combination of ideas we form judgments. Almost the
   very words of Hume, and the doctrine of the whole school of which he is
   the representative. (11.) As Epicurus held that nothing is incorporeal
   except a vacuum, he of necessity includes all the forms of existence
   under the head of matter. As there is no mind or spirit, there is no
   God, and no moral law. Virtue is only a prudent regard to happiness. In
   a certain sense he admitted the existence of God's, but they were
   corporeal beings having no concern with the affairs of men. [174]

   A recent German writer, [175] in Herzog's "Encyklopädie," under the
   head of Materialismus, says that notwithstanding the great progress of
   modern science, the Materialists of our day have not advanced a step
   upon the system of Epicurus. That system, probably owing to the
   dominant influence of the higher philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, did
   not exert much influence on the ancient mind, or on the progress of
   human thought. It was not until modern times that Materialism gained
   any great power as a philosophical theory.

   B. Materialism in England during the Eighteenth Century.

   Hobbes (1588-1679) anticipated the movement towards Materialism which
   manifested itself in England during the last century "He made sensation
   the real basis of every mental operations the sole originator of our
   ideas, the sole medium and test of truth. [176] As, therefore, we can
   perceive through sensation only what is material, he concluded that
   matter is the only reality, and that whatever exists to us must
   accordingly be a part of the material universe. The whole process of
   scientific investigation was thus reduced to the doctrine of bodies,
   beyond which, he maintained, there can be no knowledge whatever
   accessible to the human mind. This knowledge, however, does not refer
   simply to the existence of bodies, but also to their changes, of all
   which changes the ultimate principle is motion. The doctrine of bodies,
   therefore, includes the knowledge of all phenomena in relation to their
   probable causes; and of all possible causes as known from their
   observed effects. . . . . The mind itself he viewed as wholly material,
   the phenomena of consciousness being the direct result of our
   organization. The one great and fundamental fact of mind is sensation,
   which is nothing more or less than the effect of material objects
   around us, exerted by means of pressure or impact upon that material
   organization which we term the mind." [177] Thus it appears that Hobbes
   anticipated the great result of modern science, that all force may be
   resolved into motion.

   Locke (1632-1704).

   The introduction of Materialism into England during the last century is
   generally attributed to the influence of Locke's philosophy. Locke
   himself was far from being a Materialist, and the advocates of his
   system strenuously insist that his principles have no legitimate
   tendency to obliterate the distinction between matter and mind. Locke,
   however, in combating the doctrine of "innate ideas," in the sense of
   abstract truths, seemed to deny that the mind was so constituted as to
   apprehend truth intuitively, and beyond the range of experience. He
   compared the mind to a "tabula rasa." This figure suggests that all our
   knowledge is from without, as the slate contributes nothing to the
   matter written upon it. He defined ideas to be "anything with which the
   mind is immediately occupied when we think." The origin of these ideas,
   he said, was sensation and reflection. If by reflection he meant the
   observation of the phenomena of the mind, his theory is one thing. If
   it mean the process of recalling, combining, analyzing, and otherwise
   elaborating the impressions upon us from without, his theory is
   another. Probably Locke himself, and certainly many of his followers,
   took it in the latter sense; and thus the two sources of ideas, or of
   knowledge, are reduced to one, and that one is sensation. But as
   sensation can give us the knowledge only of what is external and
   material, the theory in this form seemed to leave no room for the
   higher ideas of eternal and necessary truths. Locke attempts to account
   for our ideas, of time, space, infinity, cause, and even of right and
   wrong, from observation, i.e., from observation of what is without, or
   from impressions made upon our senses. It is a common criticism upon
   Locke's great work, that in it he does not distinguish between the
   occasion and the source of our ideas. Our experience furnishes the
   occasion, and it may be the necessary condition, of waking the mind to
   the perception not only of the fact experienced, but also of the
   intuitive apprehension of the universal and necessary truth which the
   fact involves. If we did not see effects produced around us, and did
   not ourselves exercise efficiency, we might never have the idea of
   causation; but the conviction that every effect must have a cause is an
   intuitive judgment, which experience can neither produce nor limit. It
   is not from the observed tendency of some acts to produce happiness,
   and of others to produce misery, that we get the idea of the essential
   distinction between right and wrong; but from the constitution of the
   mind. Although Locke, and many of his disciples, were satisfied with
   his method of accounting for our ideas of God, of spirit, and of moral
   and religious truths, yet it is also certain that many of his followers
   felt justified on his principles to discard them.

   Hartley (1705-1757).

   Hartley was a physician and a physiologist. Physiology and psychology
   have intimate relations. It is perhaps natural that those who devote
   themselves specially to the former, should make little of the latter.
   It is the marked characteristic of our age, so far as physicists are
   concerned, that it tries to merge psychology entirely into physiology.
   Hartley adopted the principles of Locke, and endeavored to show how it
   is that external things produce sensation and thought. This he did by
   his theory of vibrations. "The objects of the external world affect in
   some manner the extreme ends of the nerves, which spread from the brain
   as centre to every part of the body. This affection produces a
   vibration, which is continued along the nerve by the agency of an
   elastic 'ether, until it reaches the brain, where it constitutes the
   phenomenon we term sensation. When a sensation has been experienced
   several times, the vibratory movement from which it arises acquires the
   tendency to repeat itself spontaneously, even when the external object
   is not present. These repetitions or relics of sensations are ideas,
   which in their turn possess the property of recalling each other by
   virtue of mutual association among themselves." [178] This doctrine of
   association of ideas is the most important part of his system. He
   insists principally on the following law: "An idea is sometimes
   associated with another through the medium of a third; but in process
   of time this intermediate idea may be disregarded, and yet the
   connection between the first and third may, notwithstanding, remain.
   Thus the idea of pleasure, which is so indissolubly connected with
   money, arises from the conveniences which it is able to procure, while
   in the mind of the miser the conveniences are lost sight of, and the
   very possession of the money itself is regarded as containing the whole
   enjoyment. In this way Hartley accounts for almost all the emotions and
   passions of the human mind. The domestic affections, for instance,
   arise from the transference of the pleasure derived from parental
   kindness to the parent itself; the social and patriotic affections from
   transferring the pleasures of society to the country which affords
   them; in like manner, also, the moral and religious affections, the
   love of virtue and the love of God, arise from the pleasures connected
   with virtuous and pious conduct, being transferred to the law of
   action, or to the supreme Lawgiver, from whom these pleasures have
   emanated." [179] The connection of this theory with Materialism is
   obvious. If vibrations of the brain constitute sensation, and if the
   relics, or spontaneous repetitions of these vibrations constitute
   thought and feeling, then all mental and moral acts are mere affections
   of our material organism. It is also obvious that, according to this
   theory, there is no more freedom in volition than in sensation. The
   former is a mode, or relic of the latter. Although this tendency of his
   system was undeniable, and although his successors drew these
   conclusions from his principles, Hartley himself was not a Materialist.
   He was a very religious man. It is not at all uncommon for a man to
   hold a speculative theory inconsistent with his faith.

   Morell [180] quotes the following criticism of Hartley's doctrine from
   the "Edinburgh Review": "There may be," says the reviewer, "little
   shakings in the brain, for anything we know, and there may even be
   shakings of a different kind accompanying every act of thought or
   perception; -- but that the shakings themselves are the thought or
   perception, we are so far from admitting, that we find it absolutely
   impossible to comprehend what is meant by the assertion. The shakings
   are certain throbbings, vibrations, or stirrings, in a whitish,
   half-fluid substance like custard, which we might see perhaps, or feel,
   if we had eyes and fingers sufficiently small or fine for the office.
   But what should we see or feel, upon the supposition that we could
   detect by our senses, everything that actually took place in the brain?
   We should see the particles of this substance change their place a
   little, move a little up or down, to the right or the left, round about
   or zigzag, or in some other course or direction. This is all that we
   could see, if Dr. Hartley's conjecture were proved by actual
   observation; because this is all that exists in motion, according to
   our conception of it, and all that we mean when we say that there is
   motion in any substance. Is it intelligible, then, to say, that this
   motion, the whole of which we see and comprehend, is thought and
   feeling, and that thought and feeling will exist, wherever we can
   excite a similar motion in a similar substance? -- In our humble
   apprehension the proposition is not so much false, as utterly unmeaning
   and incomprehensible." [181]

   If history repeats itself, so does philosophy. What the "Edinburgh
   Review" said of Hartley nearly seventy years ago, Professor Tyndall
   says of the Materialists of our day. "The passage from the physics of
   the brain to the corresponding facts of consciousness is unthinkable.
   Granted that a definite thought and a definite molecular action in the
   brain occur simultaneously; we do not possess the intellectual organ,
   nor apparently any rudiment of the organ, which would enable us to
   pass, by a process of reasoning, from the one phenomenon to the other.
   They appear together, but we do not know why. Were our minds and senses
   so expanded, strengthened, and illuminated, as to enable us to see and
   feel the very molecules of the brain; were we capable of following all
   their motions, all their grouping, all their electric discharges, if
   such there be; and were we intimately acquainted with the corresponding
   states of thought and feeling, we should probably be as far as ever
   from the solution of the problem. How are these physical processes
   connected with the facts of consciousness? The chasm between the two
   classes of phenomena would still remain intellectually impassable. Let
   the consciousness of lose, for example, be associated with a
   right-handed spiral motion of the molecules of the brain, and the
   consciousness of hate with a left-handed spiral motion. We should then
   know when we love that the motion is in one direction, and when we hate
   that the motion is in the other, but the 'Why?' would still remain
   unanswered. In affirming that the growth of the body is mechanical, and
   that thought, as exercised by us, has its correlative in the physics of
   the brain, I think the position of the 'Materialist' is stated as far
   as that position is a tenable one. I think the Materialist will be able
   finally to maintain this position against all attacks; but I do not
   think, as the human mind is at present constituted, that he can pass
   beyond it. I do not think he is entitled to say that his molecular
   grouping and his molecular motions explain everything. In reality they
   explain nothing." [182]

   Priestley (1733-1804).

   Priestley owes his permanent reputation to his important discoveries in
   the department of physical science. He was, however, prominent during
   his life for the part he took in philosophical and theological
   controversies. Devoted to science, the senses were for him the great
   sources of knowledge; all others, except supernaturaI revelation which
   he admitted, he distrusted. He adopted with enthusiasm the theory of
   Hartley which resolved thought and feeling into vibrations of the
   brain. Hartley, he said, had done more for the doctrine of mind than
   Newton accomplished for the theory of the material universe. He did not
   hesitate to avow himself a Materialist. "Priestley," says Morell, [183]
   "rested the truth of Materialism upon two deductions. The first was,
   that thought and sensation are essentially the same thing -- that the
   whole variety of our ideas, however abstract and refined they may
   become, are, nevertheless, but modifications of the sensational
   faculty. . . . . The second deduction was, that all sensation, and,
   consequently, all thought, arises from the affections of our material
   organization, and therefore consists entirely in the motion of the
   material particles of which the nerves and brain are composed." He was
   a necessitarian, and in morals a utilitarian. Believing, however, in
   God and in divine revelation, he admitted a future state of existence.
   As the Bible teaches the doctrine of the resurrection of the body,
   Priestley believed that man would be restored to conscious existence
   when that event occurred. His principal works bearing on this subject
   are: "Examination of Reid, Beattie, and Oswald," "Doctrine of
   Philosophical Necessity Explained," "Disquisitions relating to Matter
   and Spirit," and "Hartley's Theory of the Human Mind, with Essays
   relating to the subject of it."

   Hume is regarded as their master by the most advanced physicists of the
   modern scientific school, so far as their general principles and method
   of philosophizing are concerned. He was neither a Materialist nor an
   Idealist, but rather a Nihilist, as his great object was to show that
   no certainty could be attained in any department of knowledge. He
   affirmed nothing and denied everything. Such knowledge as we have comes
   from sensation, therefore, he maintained that as we have no sensation
   of efficiency, we can have no idea of it, and no evidence of its
   reality. A cause is not that which produces an effect, but simply that
   which uniformly precedes it. Consequently, anything can be the cause of
   anything. Again, as we have no perception by the senses of substance,
   there can be no such thing. This applies to mind as well as matter.
   Nothing exists to us but our thoughts and feelings. We are "nothing but
   a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each
   other with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in perpetual flux and
   movement."

   C. Materialism in France during the Eighteenth Century.

   The sensational philosophy, as it is called, found a much more
   congenial soil in France than in England. Locke's "Essay" was
   translated into the language of that country and made the subject of
   comments and lectures. His leading principles were adopted without the
   limitations and qualifications with which he had presented them, and
   conclusions drawn from them which Locke would have been the first to
   repudiate.

   Condillac, one of the first and most influential of the disciples of
   Locke, in his first work, "Essai sur l'Origine des Connaissances
   Humaines," differed comparatively little from the English philosopher.
   But in his "Traité des Sensations," he virtually discarded "reflection"
   as a source of our ideas, and regarded all thoughts, feelings, and
   volitions as "transformed sensations." "While he answered the question
   concerning the relation between the soul and body, by assuming their
   identity, he took theistic ground in accounting for the origin of the
   world. This middle ground was occupied also, at least ostensibly, by
   Diderot and D'Alembert in the French "Encyclopédie," who,
   notwithstanding their sensational theory as to the source of our
   knowledge, and their making happiness the ground of morals and end of
   life, not only maintained theistic principles, but insisted on the
   necessity of a divine revelation. This, however, was probably more a
   matter of prudence than of conviction." [184]

   These, however, were only the first steps. The extreme of materialistic
   atheism was soon reached and avowed. La Mettrie published his
   "L'Histoire Naturelle de l'Ame" in 1745, his "L'Homme Machine," the
   same year, and his "L'Homme Planté," in 1749. Helvetius published his
   work "De l'Esprit" in 1758. His book entitled "De l'Homme" was
   published after his death. The climax was reached by Baron d'Holbach in
   his "Système de la Nature," in which Materialism, fatalism, and atheism
   were openly avowed. According to this system matter and motion are
   eternal; thought is an agitation of the nerves; the soul the result of
   our corporeal organization; the will the strongest sensation; the
   ground of morals a regard to our own happiness. There is no freedom, no
   morality, no future existence, no God. When these principles got hold
   of the popular mind, then came the end.

   D. Positivism.

   Comte, the author of the "Positive Philosophy," was born in 1798, and
   died in 1859. The greater part of his life was passed in poverty and
   neglect. His only occupation was teaching. Ten years were devoted to
   the preparation of a course of lectures on philosophy which secured him
   wealth and fame. He called his system "Philosophie Positive," because
   it purported "to assume nothing beyond the content of observed facts."

   The fundamental principle of the "Positive Philosophy" is the one so
   often referred to, namely, that the senses are the only source of our
   knowledge, hence nothing exists but matter. There is no mind distinct
   from matter; no such thing as efficiency; no causes, whether first or
   final; no God; no future state of existence for man. Theology and
   psychology are, therefore, banished from the domain of science. Science
   is solely occupied in the observation of facts, and in deducing from
   them the laws by which they are determined. These laws, however, are
   not forces operating in a uniform manner, but simply statements of the
   actual order in the sequence of events. This sequence is not only
   uniform but necessary. Our business is simply to ascertain what it is.
   The only method by which this can be done is observation. This task is
   much easier in some departments than in others; for in some the facts
   to be observed are less numerous and less complicated. In mathematics
   and astronomy the facts are all of one kind; whereas in physiology and
   sociology they are of very different kinds, and vastly more
   complicated. The same rule, however, applies to all departments. In
   all, the sequence of events is uniform and necessary; and if we can
   only, by a sufficient induction of facts, ascertain what the law of
   sequence is, we shall be able to predict the future as certainly in one
   department as in another. The astronomer can tell what will be the
   position of the stars and planets a century hence. The Positivist will
   he able to foretell with equal certainty how a man will act in any
   given circumstances, and what will be the progress and state of society
   in time to come.

   It follows, therefore, according to the Positive Philosophy, (1.) That
   all our knowledge is confined to physical phenomena. (2.) That all we
   can know of such phenomena is, that they are, and the relations in
   which they stand to each other. (3.) That these relations are all
   included under the heads of sequence and resemblance. (4.) These
   relations constitute the laws of nature, and are invariable. (5.) As
   everything that exists is material, these laws, or "invariable
   relations of succession and resemblance," control all the phenomena of
   mind, as we call it, and of social life and of history, as well as
   those of nature, in the common sense of that word. (6.) As everything
   is included in the department of physics, everything is controlled by
   physical laws, and there is no more freedom in human acts than in the
   motions of the stars; and, therefore, the one can be predicted with the
   same certainty as the other.

   The following quotations from the "Philosophie Positive," "freely
   translated and condensed by Harriet Martineau," [185] include all the
   points above mentioned.

   "The first characteristic of the Positive Philosophy is that it regards
   all phenomena as subjected to invariable natural laws. Our business is,
   -- seeing how vain is any research into what are called causes, whether
   first or final, -- to pursue an accurate discovery of these laws, with
   a view to reducing them to the smallest possible number." [186] "Our
   positive method of connecting phenomena is by one or other of two
   relations, -- that of similitude or that of succession, -- the mere
   fact of such resemblance or succession being all that we can pretend to
   know; and all that we need to know; for this perception comprehends all
   knowledge which consists in elucidating something by something else, --
   in now explaining, and now foreseeing certain phenomena, by means of
   the resemblance or sequence of other phenomena." [187] "If we regard
   these functions [of the mind] under their statical aspect,-- that is,
   if we consider the conditions under which they exist, -- we must
   determine the organic circumstances of the case, which inquiry involves
   it with anatomy and physiology. If we look at the dynamic aspect, we
   have to study simply the exercise and results of the intellectual
   powers of the human race, which is neither more nor less than the
   general object of the Positive Philosophy."Vol. i. p. 11. [188]

   Comte is obliged to use the word "power," and to speak of its exercise,
   yet all his philosophy denies the existence of any such thing as
   efficiency. The laws which determine events are nothing more than facts
   of uniform sequence. According to the passage just quoted, one
   department of psychology (the statical) belongs to anatomy and
   physiology; the other (the dynamic) to the observed sequence of certain
   facts called intellectual. The sequence is invariable. The intervention
   of will is necessarily excluded, because philosophy, at least
   Positivism, is nothing unless it secures the power of prevision. But
   free acts cannot be foreseen by man. Hence Comte says, "The arbitrary
   can never be excluded while political phenomena are referred to will,
   divine or human, instead of being connected with invariable natural
   laws." [189] "If social events were always exposed to disturbance by
   the accidental intervention of the legislator, human or divine, no
   scientific prevision of them would be possible." [190]

   Intellectual exercises being regarded as a function of the brain, Comte
   says, "The positive theory of the intellectual and affective functions
   is therefore henceforth unchangeably regarded as consisting in the
   study, both rational and experimental, of the various phenomena of
   internal sensibility, which are proper to the cerebral ganglia, apart
   from their external apparatus. It is, therefore, simply a prolongation
   of animal physiology, properly so called, when this is extended so as
   to include the fundamental and ultimate attributes." [191]

   Comte, being an ardent phrenologist, founded one of the arguments for
   his system on the organization of the brain; but his great dependence
   was upon the law of human development. He admitted no essential
   difference between man and irrational animals. The superiority of man
   is only in the degree of his intelligence, which is due to his better
   physical organization. According to Comte, the whole human race, and
   every individual man, passes through three distinct stages, which he
   calls the theological, the metaphysical, and the positive. During the
   first stage all events are referred to supernatural causes. In the
   first part of this stage of their progress, men were
   fetich-worshippers; then they gradually became polytheists, and
   monotheists. This he endeavors to prove historically in regard to the
   Greeks, the Romans, and the inhabitants of western Europe. As men
   outgrew the fetich age, so they outgrew the polytheistic and
   monotheistic forms of belief. That is, they ceased to refer phenomena
   to the agency of supernatural beings.

   During the metaphysical stage, phenomena are referred to unseen causes,
   to occult powers, or forces, that is, to something which the senses
   cannot detect. This also has passed away, and men have come to
   recognize the great fact that there are no spiritual agencies in the
   universe, no efficient causes, nothing but events to be arranged
   according to the laws of sequence and resemblance. The order of events
   is invariable and necessary. What it has been in the past, it will be
   in the future. As this is the law of the development of the race
   collectively, so it is of the individual man. Every one, in his
   progress from infancy to manhood, passes through these several stages,
   the theological, the metaphysical, and the positive. We first believe
   in supernatural agencies (witches, ghosts, souls, angels, etc.); then
   in occult causes; then only in facts discerned by the senses. The
   history of the race and the experience of the individual man are thus
   made the broad and sure foundation of the Positive Philosophy.

   Remarks.

   1. Considering that the advocates of this philosophy are a mere
   handful; considering that nine hundred and ninety-nine millions of the
   thousand millions of our race still believe in God, it is a rather
   violent assumption that mankind have reached the stage of Positivism.
   It may be readily admitted that the progress of science and of
   Christianity has banished alchemy, astrology, witchcraft, and
   necromancy from enlightened portions of our race, but it has had a
   scarcely discernible effect in banishing belief in mind as distinct
   from matter, or in efficient causes, or in God. Admitting, therefore,
   the principle of the argument to be correct, the conclusion arrived at
   is contradicted by facts.

   2. The principle itself, however, is a groundless assumption. There has
   been no such development of the race, and there is no such development
   of the individual man, as the argument supposes. Much less is it true,
   as Comte maintains, that these several methods of dealing with
   phenomena are antagonistic and mutually exclusive; that if we believe
   in spiritual agents, we cannot believe in unseen, metaphysical causes;
   and that if we believe in the latter we cannot believe in the former.
   The fact is, the great mass of mankind, educated and uneducated,
   believe in both. They believe in God and mind, as well as in occult
   causes, such as electricity, magnetism, and other physical forces;
   which, in Comte's sense of the word, are metaphysical.

   With regard to this assumed law of progress, Prof. Huxley, who is as
   completely emancipated from the trammels of authority as any man of
   science now living, says, in the first place, that Comte contradicts
   himself as to this fundamental principle. In proof he quotes a long
   passage from the "Philosophie Positive," in which Comte teaches, --
   "(a.) As a matter of fact, the human intellect has not been invariably
   subjected to the law of the three states, and, therefore, the necessity
   of the law cannot be demonstrable à priori. (b.) Much of our knowledge
   of all kinds has not passed through the three states, and more
   particularly, as M. Comte is careful to point out, not through the
   first. (c.) The positive state has more or less coexisted with the
   theological, from the dawn of human intelligence. And, by way of
   completing the series of contradictions, the assertion that the three
   states are essentially different and even radically opposed,' is met a
   little lower on the same page by the declaration that 'the metaphysical
   state is, at bottom, nothing but a simple general modification of the
   first.'" "Men of science," he adds, "are not in the habit of paying
   much attention to 'laws' stated in this fashion." [192]

   After showing that the individual man does not pass through these
   several states, Prof. Huxley says, "What is true of the individual is,
   mutatis mutandis, true of the intellectual development of the species.
   It is absurd to say of men in a state of primitive savagery, that all
   their conceptions are in a theological state. Nine tenths of them are
   eminently realistic, and as 'positive' as ignorance and narrowness can
   make them." [193]

   Besides, it is not true that the race of men now existing on the earth,
   were in their primitive state fetich-worshippers, or that they
   gradually rose to polytheism and monotheism. The reverse is true. Not
   only revelation, but all history and tradition, go to show that the
   primitive state of our race was its highest state, at least so far as
   religion is concerned. Monotheism was the earliest form of religion
   among men. To that succeeded nature-worship and pantheism, and to that
   polytheism. It is a historical fact that monotheism was not reached by
   a process of development. Monotheism was first; it gradually perished
   from among men, except as miraculously preserved among the Hebrews, and
   from them diffused through the medium of, or rather, in the form of,
   Christianity. It extends nowhere beyond the influence, direct or
   indirect, of the supernatural revelation contained in the Bible. This
   is a fact which scientific men should not overlook in their deductions.

   3. Comte was guilty of the unfairness of confining his survey to a
   small portion of the nations of the earth; and that the portion too
   which had been brought under the influence of Christianity. If the law
   which he sought to establish be universal and necessary, it must have
   operated from the beginning in India and China as well as in Europe.
   The millions of those regions have not reached the monotheistic, much
   less the metaphysical, and still less the positive stage of
   development. India especially furnishes a striking refutation of this
   theory. The Hindus are a highly intellectual race. Their language and
   literature are on a par with those of Greece and Rome. Their
   philosophers, nearly three thousand years ago, anticipated the highest
   results reached by the Schellings and Hegels of our day. Yet of all the
   nations of the earth the Hindus are the least materialistic, or
   positive, in their views of nature. With them the supernatural or
   spiritual is alone real. The Hindus, therefore, cannot be subject to
   that universal and necessary law of development which is assumed as the
   foundation of the Positive Philosophy.

   4. It is of course presumptuous and idle to attempt to reason men out
   of their senses, or to convince them that what their very nature
   teaches them is true, is utterly false and untrustworthy. This,
   however, Comte not only attempts, but his whole system is rounded on
   the assumption that our nature is a delusion and a lie. That is, it is
   founded on the assumption that intuitive truths are false. It is
   intuitively true that we are free agents. This Comte denies. It is
   intuitively true that there is a specific and essential difference
   between right and wrong. This is denied. It is intuitively true that
   every effect has an efficient cause. This too is denied. It is
   intuitively true that there is a God to whom men are responsible for
   their character and conduct. This also is denied. Had all the intellect
   and all the knowledge ever possessed by men and angels been
   concentrated in the person of Comte, it had still been folly in him to
   attempt to found a system involving the denial of such truths as these.
   The Christian is not afraid to say one thing more. It is intuitively
   true, to all who have eyes to see, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God,
   and that his gospel is the wisdom of God and the power of God unto
   salvation, and that it is absolutely impossible that any theory which
   is opposed to these divine intuitions can be true.

   Another illustration of the presumptuous character of this philosophy
   is found in what it teaches concerning Sociology. Scientific men of all
   countries have long been laboriously engaged in making meteorological
   observations, and yet such are the number and complexity of the causes
   which determine the state of the weather, that no man is able to
   predict how the wind will blow forty-eight hours, much less, a year, in
   advance. The causes which determine human action in the individual and
   in society, are far more complex and inscrutable than those which
   determine the state of the weather. Yet Comte assumes to have reduced
   Sociology to a science, vying with mathematics in certainty. "I will
   venture to say," is his confident assertion, "that Sociological
   science, though only established by this book, already rivals
   mathematical science itself, not in precision and fecundity, but in
   positivity and rationality." [194]

   Practical Applications of Positivism.

   The practical applications of this philosophy are very serious.
   Positivism claims the right of absolute and universal control over all
   human affairs; over education, politics, social organization, and
   religion. As the progress of science has banished all liberty of
   opinion or of action from the departments of mathematics and astronomy,
   so it must banish it from every other department of human thought and
   activity. Speaking of liberty of conscience, Comte says: "Negative as
   we now see this dogma to be, signifying release from old authority,
   while waiting for the necessity of positive science, the absolute
   character supposed to reside in it gave it energy to fulfil its
   revolutionary destination. . . . . This dogma can never be an organic
   principle; and, moreover, it constitutes an obstacle to reorganization,
   now that its activity is no longer absorbed by the demolition of the
   old political order. . . . . Can it be supposed," he asks, "that the
   most important and the most delicate conceptions, and those which by
   their complexity are accessible to only a small number of highly
   prepared understandings, are to be abandoned to the arbitrary and
   variable decisions of the least competent minds." [195] This argument
   is conclusive. If social life, the acts of men, are as much and as
   certainly determined by physical laws as material changes, those who
   have ascertained these laws are entitled to control all other men. As
   it would be preposterous to allow men to build our houses or navigate
   our ships who would not obey the laws of nature, so it would be absurd,
   on this hypothesis, to allow those ignorant of social laws to govern
   society. Comte avows his admiration, not of popish doctrine, but of the
   papal organization, which in the new order of things he proposes to
   continue. "Papal infallibility," he says, [196] "was a great
   intellectual and social advance." Prof. Huxley pithily characterizes
   Positivism, in this regard, as "Catholicism minus Christianity."

   Religion is not excepted from this absolute subjection. The Positive
   Philosophy, as it denies the existence of the soul and the being of
   God, would seem to leave no place for religion. Comte placed on the
   title-page of his "Discours sur l'Ensemble du Positivisime," the
   announcement that his design was to reorganize society "sans Dieu ni
   Roi." Nevertheless, as men must have, as they always have had, some
   religion, a philosophy which aspired to absolute dominion over all the
   departments of human life, must make some provision for this universal,
   although imaginary, necessity of our nature. Comte, therefore,
   published a catechism of religious belief, and a ritual of religious
   worship. The object of worship was to be the aggregate of humanity
   formed by the absorption of the successive generations of men. Every
   great man has two forms of existence: one conscious before death; the
   other after death, unconscious, in the hearts and intellects of other
   men. The God of the Positive Philosophy is, therefore, the aggregate of
   the memories of great men. "Undoubtedly," says Huxley, "Dieu'
   disappeared, but the Noveau Grand-Être Suprême,' a gigantic fetich,
   turned out bran-new by M. Comte's own hands, reigned in his stead. Roi'
   also was not heard of; but in his place I found a minutely-defined
   social organization, which, if it ever came into practice, would exert
   a despotic authority such as no sultan has rivalled, and no Puritan
   presbytery in its palmiest days could hope to excel. While, as for the
   culte systématique de l'humanité,' I, in my blindness, could not
   distinguish it from sheer Popery, with M. Comte in the chair of St.
   Peter, and the names of most of the saints changed." [197]

   There are, however, to be two forms of worship, the one private, the
   other public. The special object of the former is woman, because she is
   the most perfect representative of humanity. As "Mother, she excites
   veneration; as wife, affection, and as daughter, kindness. To excite
   these sentiments, ideal woman is to be worshipped. Humanity, or the
   memory of great men, is the object for public worship, regarding which
   minute details are given. The new religion is to have ten sacraments, a
   peculiar architecture, and an extended hierarchy, under the control of
   one absolute High Priest. Such is the system which Comte was allowed to
   believe would supersede the gospel of Jesus Christ. It has already
   almost passed away. Among the advanced men of science in England there
   is scarcely one so poor as to do it reverence. [198]

   E. Scientific Materialism.

   Leading Principles.

   The leading principles of the modern scientific form of Materialism are
   embraced, by some at least, who do not consider themselves
   Materialists. They, however, adopt the language of the system, and avow
   principles which, in their generally accepted meaning, constitute what
   in the history of human thought is known as Materialism.

   The most important of these principles are the following, many of
   which, however, are not peculiar to the system.

   1. Matter and force are inseparable. Wherever there is matter there is
   force, and wherever there is force there is matter. This proposition,
   at least in the first instance, is to be understood only of physical
   force.

   2. All physical forces, such as light, heat, chemical affinities,
   electricity, magnetism, etc., etc., are convertible. Light may be
   converted into heat, and heat into light; either into electricity, and
   electricity into either; and so through the whole range. This is what
   is called the correlation of forces. Count Rumford, in a communication
   to the Royal Society of London, in 1798, satisfied that the heat
   generated in boring cannon could not be otherwise accounted for,
   advanced the doctrine that heat is a peculiar mode of motion. Since
   then the doctrine has been generalized, and it is now the commonly
   received opinion that all the physical forces are resolvable into
   motion. This generalization, however, is not accepted by all scientific
   men. They find it impossible to conceive how gravitation, which acts
   instantaneously at all distances, can he motion. It is simply a force
   which tends to produce motion.

   3. This motion, however, is not of a fluid, or ether, or any other
   imponderable substance peculiar to each particular kind of force. As
   sound consists in, or rather is produced by the vibrations of the
   atmosphere, it was natural to assume that light was the undulation of
   one medium, heat of another, electricity of another. This theory is
   discarded. The motion intended is motion in the molecules of the matter
   affected. When iron is heated, nothing is added to it. There is no
   imponderable substance called caloric. All that occurs is, that the
   molecules of the iron are agitated in a particular way. If the iron be
   magnetized, it is only a different kind of motion imparted to its
   constituent atoms. So of all other kinds of force. When, however, light
   or heat is radiated from a distant object, the motion which constitutes
   these forces must be transmitted through some medium. For where there
   is motion, there must be something that moves. And, therefore, if heat
   be motion in the molecules of the sun, that heat could not reach us
   unless there was some material medium between us and the sun.

   4. The physical forces are not only convertible one into any of the
   others, but they are quantitively equivalent; that is, a given amount
   of heat will produce an amount of light or of electricity, or of any
   other force, which, if it could be utilized, would reproduce precisely
   that amount of heat. A cannon-ball, when it impinges on a target,
   produces heat enough to give it the velocity which it had at the moment
   of contact. A certain amount of light and heat derived from the sun is
   expended in the formation of a certain amount of wood or coal; that
   amount of wood or coal will furnish precisely the amount of light and
   heat which was expended in its production. Count Rumford experimented
   to determine the quantitive relation between motion and heat, and
   arrived at very nearly the same conclusion as that reached by Dr. Joule
   of Manchester, England, who found that one pound of matter, falling
   seven hundred and seventy-two feet, will produce heat enough to raise
   the temperature of a pound of water one degree of Fahrenheit. This is
   now received as the unit of force.

   5. Force is indestructible. It is never increased or diminished What is
   lost in one form is taken up in another. Forces are, therefore,
   indestructible, convertible, and imponderable agents. This correlation
   and conservation of forces is declared by Dr. Carpenter, the eminent
   physiologist, to be "now amongst the best established generalizations
   of physical science," and the greatest scientific triumph of the age;
   "thanks," as he says, "to the labors of Faraday, Grove, Joule, Thomson,
   and Tyndall, to say nothing of those of Helmholtz and other
   distinguished continental savans." [199]

   Correlation of the Physical and Vital Forces.

   So long as this doctrine of the correlation of forces is confined to
   the department of physics, it is a purely scientific question, in which
   the theologian has no special interest. Unhappily it has not been thus
   confined. Dr. Carpenter, in the paper just quoted, says, "Every
   thoughtful physiologist must desire to see the same course of inquiry
   thoroughly pursued in regard to the phenomena of living bodies." [200]
   The first step in that direction, he adds, was taken by Dr. Mayer of
   Germany, in his remarkable treatise on "Organic Movement in its
   Relation to Material Changes."

   There appear to be three forms of opinion among scientific men, of the
   "advanced" school, as to the relation between vital and physical
   forces. First, there are some, of whom Dr. Carpenter is one, who hold
   that the forces by which vital processes are carried in, are light,
   heat, electricity, and so forth, but that these are directed or
   controlled by a force of a different kind, called "a directing agency."

   Dr. Carpenter's Theory.

   Dr. Carpenter denies that there is any such thing as vitality, or vital
   force, or nisus formativus, or Bildungstrieb. Two germs may be selected
   between which neither the microscope nor chemical analysis can detect
   the slightest difference; yet one develops into a fish, another into a
   bird. Why is this? Dr. Carpenter answers because of a "directing
   agency" residing in the germ. His language is: "The prevalent opinion
   has until lately been, that this power is inherent in the germ; which
   has been supposed to derive from its parent not merely its material
   substance, but a nisus formativus, Bildungstrieb, or germ-force, in
   virtue of which it builds itself up into the likeness of its parent,
   and maintains itself in that likeness until the force is exhausted, and
   at the same time imparting a fraction of it to each of its progeny."
   [201] This opinion he rejects; but adds, "When we look carefully into
   the question, we find that what the germ really supplies, is not the
   force, but the directive agency; thus rather resembling the control
   exercised by the superintendent builder, who is charged with working
   out the design of the architect, than the bodily force of the workmen
   who labor under his guidance in the construction of the fabric." [202]
   The conclusion at which he arrives is "that the correlation between
   heat and the organizing force of plants is not less intimate than that
   which exists between heat and motion. The special attribute of the
   vegetable germ is its power of utilizing, after its own peculiar
   fashion, the heat which it receives, and of applying a constructive
   power to the building up of its fabric after its characteristic type."
   [203]

   On this doctrine of Carpenter it may be remarked, (1.) That it seems to
   be self-contradictory. He denies to the germ a nisas formativus, or,
   Bildungstrieb, and attributes to it "a constructive power." What is the
   difference? The English phrase is a literal translation of the German
   word. (2.) He says that "heat and the organizing force of plants" are
   correlated, i.e., they are convertible one into the other and are
   quantitively equivalent; and yet the relation between them is analogous
   to that between a superintending builder and the strength of the
   workmen. According to this, the physical strength of the hod man is
   convertible into the intellect of the builder and is its quantitive
   equivalent. We do not see how this contradiction is to be avoided,
   unless he uses the phrases "constructive force," "organizing force,"
   sometimes for the "directing agency" in the germ, and sometimes, for
   the physical forces which that agency controls. But if he distinguishes
   between the "directing agency" and "the organizing force," then there
   is no correlation between the physical force and "the vital activity of
   the germ."

   3. According not only to the common, but to the latest, opinion of
   physiologists, the germ supplies something more than "a directing
   agency" (which must itself be a force). It not only directs, but it
   effects, or produces changes. It is an operative force, acting not by,
   but against physical forces or chemical affinities; counteracting them
   as long as it continues. As soon as the germ or plant or tissue dies,
   the physical forces obtain ascendency and disintegration takes place.
   This Dr. Carpenter himself admits. The most marked characteristic, he
   says, which distinguishes "vital from every kind of physical activity,"
   is, "the fact that a germ endowed with life, develops itself into an
   organism of a type resembling that of its parent; that this organism is
   the subject of incessant changes, which all tend, in the first place,
   to the evolution of its typical form; and subsequently to its
   maintenance in that form, notwithstanding the antagonism of chemical
   and physical agencies, which are continually tending to produce its
   disintegration; but that, as its term of existence is prolonged, its
   conservative power declines so as to become less and less able to
   resist these disintegrating forces, to which it finally succumbs,
   leaving the organism to be resolved by their agency into the components
   from which its materials were originally drawn." [204] This does not
   mean that chemical agencies have no part to act in the growth and
   development of plants and animals, but it certainly does mean that the
   vital force or life is an agency or power different from any kind of
   physical force. Life and physical force, therefore, are not identical.
   They are not correlated. The former is not a mere form of the latter.

   On of the most eminent of living physiologists is Dr. John Marshall,
   and he, although far from belonging to the old school, distinctly takes
   the ground that there is a vital force which cannot be resolved into
   any of the physical forces operative in the external, inorganic world.
   He says: [205] "All the strictly physical processes within the body,
   whether chemical, mechanical, thermic, electric, or photic, are
   performed by modifications of the common force which produces similar
   phenomena in the inorganic world around us. There exists, however, in
   the living animal, as in the living vegetable organism, a special
   formative or organizing energy, evolving the perfect animal or plant
   from the primitive ovum or ovule, developing its various tissues and
   organs, and conserving them from the commencement to the termination of
   its individual existence. The influence of this force, moreover,
   extends from the parent to the offspring, generation after generation."
   This is the commonly received doctrine, that physical phenomena are to
   be referred to physical forces; vital phenomena to vital force; and
   mental phenomena to mind. The new doctrine, however, is that all
   phenomena are to be referred to physical forces, no other forces being
   either known or knowable.

   The more advanced Opinions.

   The second view adopted in reference to the relation of physical to
   vital force, is, that if there be any difference it cannot be known.
   Physical forces are known. They can be measured. They can not only be
   converted one into another, but can be proved to be quantitively
   equivalent. If any other kind of force be assumed to account for vital
   phenomena, the assumption is gratuitous. It is taking for granted that
   something exists of which we know, and can know nothing. It must,
   therefore, lie beyond the sphere of science and is of no importance.
   Even Dr. Carpenter uses such language as this: "Another class of
   reasoners have cut the knot which they could not untie, by attributing
   all the actions of living bodies for which physics and chemistry cannot
   account, to a hypothetical 'vital principle;' a shadowy agency that
   does everything in its own way, but refuses to be made the subject of
   scientific examination; like the 'od-force,' or the 'spiritual power'
   to which the lovers of the marvellous are so fond of attributing the
   mysterious movements of turning and tilting tables." [206] "If a man
   asks me," says Prof. Huxley, "what the politics of the inhabitants of
   the moon are, and I reply, that I do not know; that neither I, nor any
   one else, have any means of knowing; and that, under these
   circumstances, I decline to trouble myself about the subject at all, I
   do not think he has any right to call me a skeptic." [207] It is thus
   he banishes vitality from the sphere of science, because everything,
   except matter and its functions, belongs to the region of the unknown
   and the unknowable. Prof. Tyndall and Herbert Spencer take, at times,
   the same ground.

   But, although such writers as Dr. Carpenter, in apparent contradiction
   to their own admissions, acknowledge the existence of "a directing
   agency" in the living germ, the majority of the writers of this school
   refuse to recognize any such agency or force as a scientific truth. The
   only difference between the second and third views on this general
   subject, above referred to, is, that according to the one, the
   assumption of vital as distinct from physical force, is regarded as
   gratuitous and unnecessary; according to the other, any such assumption
   is declared to be unphilosophical, and to be utterly discarded. The
   same writer sometimes takes one, and sometimes the other of these
   grounds.

   The Argument for the correlation of Physical and Vital Forces.

   Thus Prof. Huxley, although a few years since a firm advocate of vital,
   as distinct from physical force, in his discourse on the "Physical
   Basis of Life," takes the opposite ground. The argument is this: the
   elements furnished by the mineral kingdom are taken up by the plant,
   and, under the influence of light and heat, transformed into organized
   matter. The products of vegetation, starch, sugar, fibrine, etc., are
   purely material. This is true even of protoplasm, or living matter, or
   the physical basis of life, as it is called, which is elaborated by the
   plant out of the lifeless materials furnished by the soil and the
   atmosphere. There is indeed a great difference between the products of
   vegetation and the lifeless elements out of which they are formed. But
   so there is between the elements of water and water itself. If an
   electric spark be passed through a volume of oxygen and hydrogen gas,
   it becomes water, which weighs precisely as much as the volume of the
   two gases of which it is composed. It is oxygen and hydrogen in
   combination, and nothing more. Yet the properties of the water are
   entirely different from those of the oxygen and hydrogen. In like
   manner there is a great difference between the properties of the
   carbonic acid, the water, and the ammonia, of which the plant is
   composed, and the living plant itself. But as it would be
   unphilosophical to assume the existence of an unknown something called
   aquosity to account for the difference between water and its elements,
   it is no less unphilosophical to assume the existence of an unknown
   something called vitality to account for the difference between it and
   the lifeless materials of which living matter is composed.

   Animal Life.

   In like manner all the phenomena of animal life are referred to the
   physical forces inseparable from the matter which composes the animal
   structure. It is true the functions of matter in the animal tissues are
   higher than in those of the plant. But the advocates of the theory
   under consideration, endeavor to reduce the difference between animal
   and vegetable life to a minimum. It is only the upper surface of the
   leaf which is susceptible of the peculiar effects of light. So it is
   only the optic nerve that is affected in a way which is necessary to
   vision. The sensitive plant contracts when touched; and so does the
   animal muscle when the proper stimulus, nervous or electric, is
   applied. In short, as all the operations of vegetable life are due to
   physical forces, so all the phenomena of animal life are due to the
   same causes.

   On this subject Prof. Huxley says: "The matter of life is composed of
   ordinary matter, differing from it only in the manner in which its
   atoms are aggregated. It is built up of ordinary matter, and again
   resolved into ordinary matter when its work is done." [208] By
   protoplasm, or matter of life, he sometimes means matter which exhibits
   the phenomena of life; and sometimes, matter which having been
   elaborated by the plant or animal, is capable of supporting life. Hence
   he calls boiled mutton protoplasm.

   The only difference between inorganic, lifeless matter, and living
   plants or animals, is in the manner in which their atoms are
   aggregated. "Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, are all lifeless
   bodies. Of these, carbon and oxygen unite, in certain proportions, and
   under certain conditions, to give rise to carbonic acid; hydrogen and
   oxygen produce water; nitrogen and hydrogen give rise to ammonia. These
   new compounds, like the elementary bodies of which they are composed,
   are lifeless. But when they are brought together, under certain
   conditions they give rise to the still more complex body, protoplasm,
   and this protoplasm exhibits the phenomena of life. I see no break in
   this series of steps in molecular complication, and I am unable to
   understand why the language which is applicable to any one term of the
   series may not be used to any of the others. . . . . When hydrogen and
   oxygen are mimxed in a certain proportion, and an electric spark is
   passed through them, they disappear, and a quantity of water, equal in
   weight to the sum of their weights, appears in their place. There is
   not the slightest parity between the passive and active powers of the
   water and those of the oxygen and hydrogen which have given rise to
   it." [209] "What justification is there, then, for the assumption of
   the existence in the living matter of a something which has no
   representative, or correlative, in the not living matter which gave
   rise to it? What better philosophical status has 'vitality' than
   'aquosity?' And why should 'vitality' hope for a better fate than the
   other 'itys' which have disappeared since Martinus Scriblerus accounted
   for the operation of the meat-jack by its inherent 'meat-roasting
   quality,' and scorned the materialism of those who explained the
   turning of the spit by a certain mechanism worked by the draught of the
   chimney? . . . . If the properties of water may be properly said to
   result from the nature and disposition of its component molecules, I
   can find no intelligible ground for refusing to say that the properties
   of protoplasm result from the nature and disposition of its molecules."
   [210]

   The doctrine, therefore, is, that carbonic acid, water, and ammonia,
   lifeless bodies, under certain conditions, become living matter, not in
   virtue of any new force or principle communicated to them, but solely
   in virtue of a different arrangement of their molecules. Of this living
   matter all plants and animals are composed, and to the properties or
   physical forces inherent in the matter of which they are composed, all
   the phenomena of vegetable and animal life are to be referred.
   "Protoplasm," says Prof. Huxley, "is the clay of the potter: which,
   bake it and paint it as he will, remains clay, separated by artifice
   and not by nature, from the commonest brick or sun-dried clod." [211]
   As the brick, no matter what its shape or color, can have no properties
   not inherent in the clay, so vegetable or animal organisms can have no
   properties which do not belong to protoplasm, which, in the last
   analysis, is nothing but carbonic acid, water, and ammonia.

   Professor Huxley is not only a distinguished naturalist, but a popular
   lecturer and preacher of "Lay Sermons," and thus has become a
   representative man among the advocates of this new form of Materialism.
   He is, however, very far from standing alone. "Some of the most
   distinguished living physicists, chemists, and naturalists, says Dr.
   Beale, "have accepted this physical theory of life. They have taught
   that life is but a mode of ordinary force, and that the living thing
   differs from the non-living thing, not in quality, or essence, or kind,
   but merely in degree." [212] "So long," says the same writer, "as the
   advocates of the physical doctrine of life contented themselves with
   ridiculing 'vitality' as a fiction and a myth, because it could not be
   made evident to the senses, measured or weighed, or proved
   scientifically to exist, their position was not easily assailed; but
   now when they assert dogmatically that vital force is only a form or
   mode of ordinary motion they are bound to show that the assertion rests
   upon evidence, or it will be regarded by thoughtful men as one of a
   large number of fanciful hypotheses, advocated only by those who desire
   to swell the ranks of the teachers and expounders of dogmatic science,
   which, although pretentious and authoritative, must ever be intolerant
   and unprogressive." [213]

   Mental Phenomena.

   Not only are the operations of vegetable and animal life, according to
   the new doctrine, due to physical forces, but the same is true of all
   mental operations. If the argument from analogy is valid in the one
   case, it is valid in the other. If we must believe that the properties
   of protoplasm, or living matter, are to be referred to the mode in
   which its molecules are aggregated, because the properties of water are
   due to the peculiar aggregation of the atoms of which its elements,
   hydrogen and oxygen, are composed; then we must believe that all
   thought and feeling are due to the molecular composition and movements
   of the brain atoms. Accordingly, Professor Huxley, after saying that
   "vitality" has no better philosophical standing than "aquosity," warns
   his readers that they cannot stop with that admission. "I bid you
   beware," he says, "that in accepting these conclusions, you are placing
   your feet on the first rung of a ladder, which in most people's
   estimation is the reverse of Jacob's, and leads to the antipodes of
   heaven. It may seem a small thing to admit that the dull vital actions
   of a fungus or a foraminifer are the properties of their protoplasm,
   and are the direct results of the nature of the matter of which they
   are composed. But if, as I have endeavored to prove to you, their
   protoplasm is essentially identical with, and most readily converted
   into, that of any animal, I can discover no logical halting-place,
   between the admission that such is the case, and the further concession
   that all vital action may with equal propriety be said to be the result
   of the molecular forces of the protoplasm which displays it. And if so,
   it must be true, in the same sense and to the same extent, that the
   thoughts to which I am now giving utterance, and your thoughts
   regarding them, are the expression of molecular changes in that matter
   of life which is the source of our other vital phenomena." [214]
   "Further," he says, "I take it to be demonstrable that it is utterly
   impossible to prove that anything whatever may not be the effect of a
   material and necessary cause, and that human logic is equally
   incompetent to prove that any act is really spontaneous. A really
   spontaneous act is one which, by the assumption, has no cause [i.e. no
   material cause, for he admits no other]; and the attempt to prove such
   a negative as this is, on the face of the matter, absurd. And while it
   is thus a philosophical impossibility to demonstrate that any given
   phenomenon is not the effect of a material cause, any one who is
   acquainted with the history of science will admit that its progress has
   in all ages meant, and now more than ever means, the extension of the
   province of what we call matter and causation, and the concomitant
   gradual banishment from all regions of human thought of what we call
   spirit and spontaneity." [215] "After all, what do we know of this
   terrible 'matter,' except as a name for the unknown and hypothetical
   cause of states of our own consciousness? And what do we know of that
   'spirit' over whose threatened extinction by matter a great lamentation
   is arising, . . . . except that it is also a name for an unknown and
   hypothetical cause or condition of states of consciousness? In other
   words, matter and spirit are but names for the imaginary substrata of
   groups of natural phenomena." [216] "As surely as every future grows
   out of past and present, so will the physiology of the future gradually
   extend the realm of matter and law until it is co-extensive with
   knowledge, with feeling, and with action." [217] He cites the
   often-quoted exhortation of Hume, and enforces "the most wise advice"
   which it contains. "If we take in our hand," says Hume, "any volume of
   divinity or school-metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, does it
   contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does
   it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact or
   existence? No. Commit it, then, to the flames; for it can contain
   nothing but sophistry and illusion." [218]

   The history of human speculation does not furnish a more explicit
   avowal of Materialism than that contained in the above quotations. All
   known effects are ascribed to material causes. Spirit is declared to
   have only an imaginary existence. Spontaneity is pronounced an
   absurdity. Necessity is affirmed to be inexorable and universal. Yet
   Huxley says he is no Materialist. This in a sense is true. He is not a
   Materialist, because he believes in neither matter nor spirit. He avows
   himself a disciple of Hume, who taught that we know nothing but
   impressions and ideas. Substance, whether material or spiritual,
   efficiency, and God, are banished from the sphere of knowledge to that
   of "sophistry and illusion." He avows his fellowship with Herbert
   Spencer, the fundamental principle of whose "New Philosophy" is, that
   all we know, or can know, is, that force is and that it is persistent,
   while force itself is absolutely inscrutable. This blots the soul and
   God out of existence, except as those words indicate an unknown force.
   But as he also holds that all forces are convertible, the distinction
   between material and mental forces, whether human or divine, is
   obliterated. He avails himself of the common assumption that his theory
   does not degrade spirit, but exalts matter. It is the verdict of
   history, however, as Julius Mäller truly says, "That every attempt to
   spiritualize matter ends in materializing spirit." On this subject
   Spencer says: "Men who have not risen above that vulgar conception
   which unites with matter the contemptuous epithets 'gross' and 'brute,'
   may naturally feel dismay at the proposal to reduce the phenomena of
   life, of mind, and of society, to a level with those which they think
   so degraded. . . . . The course proposed does not imply a degradation
   of the so-called higher, but an elevation of the so-called lower."
   [219] This at least is an avowal that the phenomena of life, mind, and
   society are to be referred to material or physical causes. This,
   indeed, he repeatedly asserts. After insisting on the transformation of
   physical forces into chemical, and these into vital, he adds, "Many
   will be alarmed by the assertion that the forces which we distinguish
   as mental, come within the same generalization. Yet there is no
   alternative but to make this concession. [220] . . . . Any hesitation
   to admit that between the physical forces and the sensations there
   exists a correlation like that between the physical forces themselves,
   must disappear on remembering how the one correlation like the other,
   is not qualitive only, but quantitive." [221] "Various classes of facts
   unite to prove that the law of metamorphosis, which holds among the
   physical forces, holds equally between them and the mental
   forces. . . . . How this metamorphosis takes place -- how a force
   existing as motion, light, or heat, can become a mode of
   consciousness," is mysterious; but he adds, it is not a greater mystery
   "than the transformations of physical forces into each other." [222]

   Dr. Maudsley, a distinguished writer of the same school, [223] says,
   "Few, if any, will now be found to deny that with each display of
   mental power there are correlative changes in the material substratum;
   that every phenomenon of mind is the result, as manifest in energy, of
   some change, molecular, chemical, or vital, in the nervous elements of
   the brain." Again, he says, [224] "With regard to the manifold
   phenomena of mind; by observation of them, and abstraction from the
   particular, we get the general conception, or the essential idea of
   mind, an idea which has no more existence out of the mind, than any
   other abstract idea or general term. In virtue, however, of that
   powerful tendency in the human mind to make the reality conformable to
   the idea, a tendency which has been at the bottom of so much confusion
   in philosophy, this general conception has been converted into an
   objective entity, and allowed to tyrannize over the understanding. A
   metaphysical abstraction has been made into a spiritual entity and a
   complete barrier thereby interposed in the way of positive
   investigation."

   The passages quoted above are a fair specimen of the kind of reasoning
   in which scientific men frequently indulge. In the first quotation,
   there are two clauses presented as equivalent, which are in fact
   essentially different; and substituting the one for the other is just a
   silent and subtle begging of the question. The first says that every
   mental act is attended by a molecular change in the brain. The other in
   effect says, the molecular change is the mental act. These two
   propositions are as different as day and night. The theory is that a
   certain kind of molecular motion in iron is heat; and a certain kind of
   molecular motion in the brain is thought. And all the proof, as far as
   the latter is concerned, is that the one attends the other. But the
   formation of an image on the retina attends sight, and yet does not
   prove that the image is our consciousness when we see.

   Again, in the second passage, Dr. Maudsley says that "mind is an
   abstract idea," which has no existence outside "of the mind," i.e.,
   outside of itself. An abstract idea has an abstract idea, which it
   makes into an objective entity. Men who deny the objective existence of
   mind, can no more think, speak, or write without recognizing its
   existence, than an idealist can act without recognizing the existence
   of the external world. Any theory which involves a denial of the laws
   of our nature is of necessity absurd.

   The German Physicists.

   As might be expected, the scientific men of the continent are more
   outspoken in their Materialism than those of England. A late German
   writer, Th. Otto Berger, Oberlehrer fur Mathematik and Physik, [225]
   says: Materialism is the philosophy of the five senses, it admits
   nothing but on the testimony of sensation, and therefore denies the
   existence of the soul, of God, and of everything supersensuous. In its
   modern form, it teaches that as the material is alone true and real, it
   is uncreated and eternal. It always has been and always will be. It is
   indestructible, and, in its elements, unchangeable. Force is
   inseparable from matter. According to the theory no matter is without
   force, and no force is without matter. No force exists of itself; and,
   therefore, there is none to which the creation of matter is to be
   referred. The universe as it now is, is due to the gradual evolution of
   the two elements, matter and force; which evolution proceeds under the
   operation of fixed laws. The lower organisms are first formed; then the
   higher, until man appears. All life, whether animal, vegetable, or
   spiritual, is due to the working of physical and chemical forces in
   matter. As no power exists but in matter, there can be no divine Being
   with creative power nor any created human soul. Berger quotes Virchow
   as saying, "The scientific naturalist knows only bodies and the
   properties of bodies." All that is beyond them he pronounces
   "transcendental, and the transcendental is the chimerical." He also
   quotes B. C. Vogt, as saying, "We admit of no creator, either in the
   beginning, or in the course of the world's history; and regard the idea
   of a self-conscious, extramundane creator as ridiculous." Man,
   according to these writers, consists only of a material body; all
   mental acts and states are of the brain. When the body dies, the man
   ceases to exist. "The only immortality," says Moleschott, "is, that
   when the body is disintegrated, its ammonia, carbonic acid, and lime,
   serve to enrich the earth, and to nourish plants, which feed other
   generations of men." [226]

   F. Refutation.

   As Materialism, in its modern form, in all that is essential to the
   theory, is the same that it was a thousand years ago, the old arguments
   against it are as available now as they ever were. Its fundamental
   affirmation is, that all the phenomena of the universe, physical,
   vital, and mental, are to be referred to unintelligent physical forces;
   and its fundamental negation is, that there is no such objective entity
   as mind or spirit. If, therefore, it can be shown that unintelligent
   force cannot account for all the phenomena of the universe; and that
   there is such an objective entity or substance, as mind, the theory is
   refuted. There are two methods of combating any given theory. The one
   is the scientific, which calls in question the accuracy or the
   completeness of the data on which it is founded, or the validity of the
   inferences deduced from them. The other is the shorter and easier
   method of the reductio ad absurdum. The latter is just as legitimate
   and valid as the former. It is to be remembered that every theory
   includes two factors; facts and principles; or, facts and inferences
   drawn from them. The facts may be admitted, when the principles or
   inferences may be denied. Thus the facts on which Materialists insist
   may, for the most part at least, be acknowledged; while the sweeping
   inferences which they draw from them, in the eye of reason may not be
   worth a straw. All such inferences must be rejected whenever they
   conflict with any well-established truth, whether of intuition,
   experience, or of divine revelation.

   Three general theories have been proposed to solve the great problem of
   the universe: the Materialistic, the Pantheistic, and the Theistic.
   According to the first all the phenomena of the universe are due to
   matter and its forces; according to the second, in its most rational
   form, all power, activity, and life, are the power, activity, and life
   of the one universal mind. The third, or Theistic theory, assumes the
   existence of an infinite, extramundane God, who created matter, endowed
   with forces, and finite minds gifted with intelligence and will; and
   that all the ordinary phenomena of the universe are proximately due to
   these physical and mental forces as constantly upheld and controlled by
   the omnipresent wisdom and power of God. It may be doubted whether any
   amount of argument can deepen the conviction that the Theistic solution
   of this great problem is the true one. It is seen to be true, because
   it is seen to be a solution. It satisfactorily accounts for all the
   facts of consciousness and observation. It satisfies the reason, the
   heart, and the conscience. It is in fact self-evidently true, in the
   sense that no man to whom it has been once proposed, can ever
   permanently shake off the conviction of its truth. The other theories
   are not solutions. They may account for some classes of facts, but not
   for others. Our present concern, however, is with Materialism.

   Materialism contradicts the Facts of Consciousness.

   1. The primary principle of all knowledge is the knowledge of self.
   This must be assumed. Unless we are we cannot know. This knowledge of
   self is a knowledge that we are something; a real existence; not merely
   a state or mode of something else; but that the self is a substance, a
   real, objective entity. It is, moreover, a knowledge not only that we
   are a substance, but also that we are an individual subsistence, which
   thinks, feels, and wills. Here, then, is mind, i.e., an individual,
   intelligent, voluntary agent, necessarily included in the first, and
   the most essential of all truths. If this be denied, then Hume is
   right, and we can know nothing. It is, moreover, included in this
   knowledge of the Self, that the body is not the Ego. Although the body
   is intimately, and even vitally united to the substance in which our
   personality resides, it is nevertheless objective to it. It is the
   organ which the Self uses, and by which it holds communion with the
   external world. That these are really facts of consciousness, and not
   merely dicta, or arbitrary assumptions, is clear because they are
   universally and of necessity recognized. They are imbedded in all human
   languages; they are involved in all expressions of human thought; they
   are of necessity assumed by those who theoretically deny them. The
   Materialist cannot think, or speak, or write, without assuming the
   existence of mind as distinct from matter, any more than the Idealist
   can live and act without assuming the existence of the external world.

   Our knowledge of mind, therefore, as a thinking substance, is the
   first, and most certain, and the most indestructible of all forms of
   knowledge; because it is involved in self-knowledge, or
   self-consciousness, which is the indispensable condition of all
   knowledge. That which knows is, in the order of nature, before that
   which is known. It is impossible, therefore, that the Materialist can
   have any higher evidence of the existence of matter, or of force, than
   that which every man has, in his own consciousness, of the existence of
   mind. To deny the one is as unreasonable as to deny the other. Neither
   can be denied, except theoretically. As a matter of fact, every man
   believes in matter, and every man believes in mind. What are our
   sensations which are relied upon so confidently to give us knowledge of
   physical phenomena, but states of consciousness? If consciousness is to
   be trusted in reporting the testimony of the senses, why is it not to
   be trusted when it reports the facts of our interior life? If it is
   believed when it says there is something visible and tangible without
   us, why should it not be believed when it says there is something which
   thinks and wills within us? If unreliable in the one case, it is
   unreliable in the other; and if unreliable in either, the whole
   foundation of knowledge and of all faith is swept away. Confidence in
   the veracity of consciousness is our only security from the wildest,
   the most irrational, and the most degrading skepticism.

   It may be said, however, that the Materialist does not deny that there
   is something within us that thinks and wills. He only says that that
   something is the brain. This, however, is to ignore one half of the
   testimony which consciousness really bears. It testifies not only that
   there are such sensations as those of sight and touch, but that there
   is a real objective substance which is tangible and visible. That is to
   say, we believe in virtue of the constitution of our nature, and
   therefore of necessity, when we see or touch, that the objects of our
   sense-perceptions have a real, objective existence. This every man
   believes, and cannot help believing. And in like manner, when he
   thinks, feels, or wills, he believes, in virtue of the constitution of
   his nature, and therefore by a like necessity, that he himself is an
   intelligent, feeling, and voluntary substance. That is, he believes
   that the Self is mind, or spirit, to which the body is objective, and
   therefore different front the Self. The belief in mind, therefore, is
   involved in the belief of self-existence. Consciousness gives us the
   assurance that the Self is an intelligent, voluntary agent, or spirit.

   2. Another fact of consciousness which Materialism denies, either
   avowedly or by necessary implication, is the fact of free agency. This,
   indeed, is involved in what has already been said. Nevertheless there
   are those who admit the existence of mind who deny that man is a free
   agent. It needs no proof that consciousness attests that men have the
   power of self-determination. Every man knows this to be true with
   regard to himself. Every man recognizes the fact with regard to his
   fellow-men. This again is a conviction which no obduracy of the
   conscience, and no sophistry of argument can permanently obliterate
   from the human mind. This, however, Materialism denies. Physical forces
   act necessarily and uniformly. In referring all mental action to
   physical forces, Materialism cannot but exclude all freedom of action.
   There is no spontaneity in chemical affinity, in light, heat, or
   electricity; yet to these forces all vital and mental phenomena are
   referred. If thought be a certain kind of molecular motion of the
   brain, it is no more free than that other kind of molecular motion
   called heat. And this is the more obviously true, if they are
   correlative, the one being changed into the other. Accordingly
   Materialists, as a general thing, are avowed necessitarians. This is
   not only true of the Positivists, but the doctrine that human action is
   determined by necessary laws, is the foundation of their whole system
   of Social Science. And Professor Huxley, as we have seen, pronounces a
   spontaneous act, from the nature of the case, an absurdity. It is for
   him a causeless effect. Every man, therefore, who knows that he is a
   free agent, knows that Materialism cannot be true.

   3. Materialism contradicts the facts of our moral and religious
   Consciousness. Our moral perceptions are the clearest, the most
   certain, and the most authoritative of all of our cognitions. If a man
   is shut up to deny either the testimony of his senses or the truths of
   reason, on the one hand, or the testimony of his moral nature on the
   other, all experience shows that he will give up sense and reason, and
   bow to the authority of conscience. He cannot help it. No man can free
   himself from the sense of sin, or of accountability. These moral
   convictions involve in them, or, at least, necessitate the belief in a
   God to whom we must give an account. But Materialism, in banishing all
   mind in man, leaves nothing to be accountable; and in banishing all
   mind from the universe, leaves no Being to whom an account can be
   rendered. To substitute for an intelligent, extramundane, personal God,
   mere "inscrutable force," is a mockery, an insult. Our whole moral and
   religious nature declares any such theory to be false. It cannot be
   true unless our whole nature be a lie. And our nature cannot be a lie,
   unless, as Sir William Hamilton says, the whole universe be "a dream of
   a dream." To call upon men to worship gravitation, and sing hallelujahs
   to the whirlwind, is to call upon them to derationalize themselves. The
   attempt is as idle as it is foolish and wicked.

   This argument from the facts of consciousness against Materialism, is
   met by the assertion that consciousness is not to be trusted. Dr.
   Maudsley devotes the greater part of the first chapter of his book on
   the "Physiology of the Mind," to the establishment of this point. He
   argues that self-consciousness is unreliable in the information which
   it does give, and incompetent to give any account of a large part of
   our mental activity. lt gives no account of the mental phenomena of the
   infant, of the uncultivated adult, and of the insane; no account of the
   bodily conditions which underlie every mental manifestation; no account
   of the large field of unconscious mental action exhibited, not only in
   the unconscious assimilation of impressions, but in the registrations
   of ideas and of their associations, in their latent existence and
   influence when not active, and their recall into activity; and no
   account of the influence organically exerted on the brain by other
   organs of the body. That is, consciousness does not tell us all things,
   and sometimes tells us wrong. Cannot the same be said of the senses?
   Can they inform us of everything which goes on in the body? Do they not
   often deceive us? Are not the sensations of the delirious and the
   maniac altogether untrustworthy? Does it follow from this that our
   senses are never to be relied upon? What then becomes of the physical
   sciences, which are founded on the trustworthiness of the senses. The
   fact is that if the testimony of consciousness is not to be received as
   to our mental operations, it cannot be received as to our sensations.
   If we have no trustworthy evidence of the existence of mind, we have no
   valid evidence of the existence of matter; and there is no universe, no
   God. All is nothing.

   Happily men cannot emancipate themselves from the laws of their nature.
   They cannot help believing the well-attested testimony of their senses,
   and they cannot help believing the testimony of consciousness as to
   their personal identity, and as to the real, objective existence of the
   soul as the subject of their thoughts, feelings, and volitions. As no
   man can refuse to believe that he has a body, so no man can refuse to
   believe that he has a soul, and that the two are distinct as the Self
   and the Not-Self.

   Materialism contradicts the Truths of Reason.

   1. It is intuitively true that every effect must have a cause. This
   does not mean merely that every effect must have an antecedent; or, as
   Hume says, that anything may be the cause of anything. Nor does it mean
   merely that every effect must have an efficient cause. But it means
   that the antecedent or cause of every effect must have that kind and
   degree of efficiency which will rationally account for the effect.

   There are two general classes of effects with which we are familiar,
   and which are specifically different, and therefore must have
   specifically different causes. The one class consists of effects which
   do not, the other of those which do indicate design. In the latter we
   see evidence of a purpose, of foresight, of provision for the future,
   of adaptation, of choice, of spontaneity, as well as of power. In the
   former all these indications are absent. We see around us innumerable
   effects belonging to each of these classes. We see water constantly
   flowing from a higher to a lower level; vapor constantly ascending from
   the sea; heat producing expansion, cord contraction, water
   extinguishing fire, alkalies correcting acidity, etc., etc. On the
   other hand, the world is crowded with works of human intelligence; with
   statues, pictures, houses, ships, complicated machines for different
   purposes, with books, libraries, hospitals prepared for the wants of
   the sick, with institutions of learning, etc., etc. No man can help
   believing that these classes of effects are specifically different, nor
   can he help believing that they are due to causes specifically
   different. In other words, it is self-evident that an unintelligent
   cause cannot produce an intelligent effect; it cannot purpose, foresee,
   organize, or choose. Professor Joule may determine through what space a
   weight must fall to produce a given amount of heat; but can he tell how
   far it must fall to write a poem, or produce a Madonna? Such a cause
   has no tendency to produce such an effect. And to suppose it to operate
   from eternity, is only to multiply eternally, nothing by nothing, it is
   nothing still.

   If every man recognizes the absurdity of referring all the works of
   human ingenuity and intellect to unintelligent, physical force, how
   much greater is the absurdity of referring to blind force the
   immeasurably more stupendous, complicated, and ordered works of God,
   everywhere indicative of purpose, foresight, and choice. Of this
   absurdity Materialism is guilty. It teaches, in its modern form, that
   to carbonic acid, water, and ammonia, with the molecular forces they
   contain, is the causal efficiency to which all organisms from the
   fungus to man, and all vital and mental phenomena, are to be referred.
   This is the doctrine elaborately proposed and defended in Professor
   Huxley's paper on the "Physical Basis of Life." That paper is devoted
   to establishing two propositions. The first is, "That all animal and
   vegetable organisms are essentially alike in power, in form, and in
   substance; and the second, That all vital and intellectual functions
   are the properties of the molecular dispositions and changes of the
   material basis (protoplasm) of which the various animals and vegetables
   consist." [227] He even intimates, after referring to a clock which
   marks the time, and the phases of the moon, as an illustration of the
   vital and intellectual phenomena of the universe, as produced by
   molecular motions and combinations, "that the existing world lay
   potentially in the cosmic vapor; and that a sufficient intelligence
   could, from a knowledge of the properties of the molecules of that
   vapor, have predicted, say the state of the Fauna of Britain in 1869,
   with as much certainty as one can say what will happen to the vapor of
   the breath in a cold winters day." [228] On this it is obvious to
   remark, in the first place, that it is not one whit in advance of the
   theory of Epicurus propounded more than two thousand years ago. As the
   whole mass of thinking men have turned their backs on that theory from
   that day to this, it is not probable that the reassertion of it,
   however confidently made, will have much effect upon men who have
   either heads or hearts. In the second place, it gives no rational
   account of the origin of the universe, and of the wonders which it
   contains. It violates the fundamental intuitive truth that every effect
   must have an adequate cause, inasmuch as it refers intelligent effects
   to unintelligent causes; all the libraries in the world, for example,
   to "the properties of the molecules," of carbonic acid, water, and
   ammonia.

   2. A second truth of Reason which Materialism contradicts is that an
   infinite succession of effects is as unthinkable as a self-supporting
   chain of an infinite number of links. The modern doctrine is that
   lifeless matter never becomes living except when brought into contact
   with previous living matter. It is the office of the living plant to
   take up the dead elements of the inorganic world and imbue them with
   life. The plant, therefore, must either precede protoplasm, which is
   impossible, as it is composed of protoplasm; or the protoplasm must
   precede the plant, which is equally impossible, because the plant
   alone, in the first instance, can make protoplasm; or there must be an
   infinite succession. That is, an infinite number of causeless effects,
   which is no less impossible. The doctrine of spontaneous generation, or
   of life originating out of dead matter, is repudiated by the most
   advanced advocates of the modern form of Materialism. Professor Huxley
   has done the cause of truth good service by his able refutation of that
   doctrine. [229] Whatever may be the ultimate decision of the question
   as to the origin of life, it is enough for the present that the modern
   advocates of Materialism admit that living matter can only come from
   matter already alive. This admission, it is now urged, is fatal to
   their theory, as it necessitates the assumption of an eternal effect.
   If dead matter can only be made alive by previous living matter, there
   must be a source of life outside of matter, or life never could have
   begun.

   Materialism inconsistent with the Facts of Experience.

   It is generally admitted that in nature, i.e., in the external world,
   there are four distinct spheres, or, as they are sometimes called,
   planes of existence. First, the common chemical compounds, which
   constitute the mineral kingdom; second, the vegetable kingdom; third,
   the irrational animal world; and fourth, Man. It is admitted that all
   the resources of science are incompetent to raise matter from one of
   these planes to another. The plant contains ingredients derived from
   the mineral kingdom, with something specifically different. The animal
   contains all that is in the plant, with something specifically
   different. Man contains all that enters into the constitution of the
   plant and animal, with something specifically different. The lifeless
   elements of the mineral kingdom, under "the influence of preëxistent
   living matter," and not otherwise, become living and life supporting
   matter in the plant. The products of vegetable life, in like manner,
   become the matter of animal tissues and organs, but only under the
   influence of preëxisting living animal tissues. So, also, the products
   of the vegetable and animal kingdoms are received into the human
   system, and become connected with the functions and phenomena of the
   intellectual and moral life of man, but never otherwise than in the
   person of a man. This outstanding fact, vouched for by the whole
   history of our globe, proves that there is something in the plant which
   is not in lifeless matter; somethiing in the animal which is not in the
   plant, and something in man which is not in the animal. To assume, with
   the Materialist, that the organizing life of the plant comes out of
   lifeless matter; that the sensitive and voluntary life of the animal
   comes out of the insensible and involuntary life of the plant; or that
   the rational, moral, and spiritual life of Man comes out of the
   constituents of the animal, is to assume as a fact something which all
   experience contradicts. We are not forgetful of the theories which
   refer these different grades or orders of existence to some process of
   natural development. We here, however, refer only to the outstanding
   fact of history, that, in the sphere of human experience, lifeless
   matter does not become organizing and living, in virtue of its own
   physical forces; nor the plant an animal; nor the animal a man from
   anything in the plant or animal, but only in virtue of an ab extra
   vital influence. It is indeed said that as the same chemical elements
   combined in one way, have certain properties; and when combined in
   another way, have other properties; so the same elements combined in
   one way in lifeless matter and in other ways, in plants, animals, and
   man, may account for all their distinctive characteristics. But it is
   to be remembered that the properties of chemical compounds, however
   varied, are chemical, and nothing more; whereas, in vital organisms the
   properties or phenomena are specifically different from mere chemical
   effects. They have no relation to each other, any more than gravity to
   beauty; and, therefore, the one cannot account for the other.

   Materialism is Atheistic.

   Atheism is the denial of an extramundane personal God. In saying that
   Materialism is Atheism, it is not meant that all Materialists are
   atheists. Some, as for example, Dr. Priestley, confine the application
   of their principles to the existing order of things. They admit the
   being of God to whom they refer the creation of the world. The number,
   however, of such illogical Materialists is small. Leaving out of view
   these exceptional cases, the philosophers of this school may be divided
   into three classes, --

   (1.) Avowed atheists. To this class belong the Epicureans; the French
   skeptics of the last century; the Positivists; and a large part of the
   physicists of the present generation, especially in Europe. (2.) Those
   who repudiate the charge of atheism, because they admit the necessary
   existence of an inscrutable force. But inscrutable force is not God. In
   rejecting the doctrine of an extramundane Spirit, self-conscious,
   intelligent, and voluntary, the First Cause of all things, they reject
   Theism; and the denial of Theism is Atheism. (3.) Those whose
   principles involve the denial of an extramundane God. To this class
   belong all those who deny the distinction between matter and mind; who
   deny the "supersensual," and "supernatural," who affirm that physical
   force is the only kind of force of which we have any knowledge; and who
   maintain that thought is in such a sense a product of the brain, that
   where there is no brain there can be no thought. Büchner, who although
   an avowed atheist, is, as to this point, a fair representative of the
   whole school, says that the fundamental principle (der oberste
   Grundsatz) of our philosophy is, "No matter without force; and no force
   without matter." "A spirit without a body," he adds, "is as unthinkable
   as electricity or magnetism without the matter of which they are
   affections." [230] This he makes the ground of his argument to prove
   the impossibility of the existence of the soul after death. The
   principle, if admitted, is equally conclusive against the existence of
   God. As Materialism leaves us no God to reverence and trust, no Being
   to whom we are responsible; and as it denies any conscious existence
   after death, it can be adopted only on the sacrifice of the higher
   attributes of our nature; and its whole tendency must be to demoralize
   and degrade.

   The Correlation of Physical and Vital and Mental Forces.

   Besides the considerations urged above against Materialism as a general
   theory, it may be proper to say a few words in reference to its modern
   scientific form. It is admitted that it is the province of scientific
   men to discuss scientific questions; and that much injury to the cause
   of truth has followed the attempts of men not devoted to such pursuits,
   undertaking to adjudicate in such cases. Physicists are wont to take
   high ground on this subject, and to warn off as intruders all
   metaphysicians and theologians, all who are devoted to the study of the
   supersensuous and the supernatural. They are not allowed to be heard on
   questions of science. The rule must work both ways. If metaphysicians
   and theologians must be silent on matters of science, then scientific
   men devoted to the study of the sensuous, are not entitled to be
   dictatorial in what regards the supersensuous. A man may be so
   habituated to deal with quantity and number, as to become incapable of
   appreciating beauty or moral truth. In like manner a man may be so
   devoted to the examination of what his senses reveal, as to come to
   believe that the sensible alone is true and real. The senses have their
   rights, and so have reason and conscience; and the votaries of sense
   are not entitled to claim the whole domain of knowledge as exclusively
   their own.

   While, therefore, it is conceded that it belongs specially to
   scientific men to deal with scientific subjects, yet other classes have
   some rights which are not to be denied. They have the right to judge
   for themselves on the validity of the arguments of scientific men; and
   they have the right to appeal from one scientific man to another, and
   from the few to the many. So far as the correlation of physical and
   vital forces is concerned, it is not only a new doctrine, but as yet is
   adopted only by "advanced thinkers," as they are called, and call
   themselves. Dr. H. B. Jones, F. R. S., one of the more modest advocates
   of the doctrine, [231] says, "We are only just entering upon the
   inquiry how far our ideas of conservation and correlation of energy can
   be extended to the biological sciences." And certain it is that the
   leading men of science, both in Europe and America, are firm believers
   in vital and mental forces, as distinct in kind, from all physical
   forces operative in the inorganic world.

   The Arguments for such Correlation are Invalid.

   The Argument from Analogy.

   It has already been stated on the authority of the advocates of the
   theory, that their first and most important argument in its support is
   from analogy. The physical forces are all correlated; one is
   convertible into either of the others; all may be resolved into motion.
   This creates, as it is said, a strong presumption, that all force,
   whatever its phenomena, is essentially the same thing. If one kind of
   motion is heat, another electricity, another light, it is fair to infer
   that vitality is only another kind of motion, and thought and feeling
   another. As there is no reason for assuming a specific force for light,
   and another for heat, therefore it is unnecessary, and unphilosophical,
   to assume a specific kind of force to account for vital or mental
   phenomena. Prof. Barker of Yale College, says, [232] "Today, as truly
   as seventy-five years ago when Humboldt wrote, the mysterious and awful
   phenomena of life, are commonly attributed to some controlling agent
   residing in the organism -- to some independent presiding deity,
   holding it in absolute subjection." This presiding agent is called
   "vital fluid," "materia vitæ diffusa," "vital force." "All these
   names," he adds, "assume the existence of a material or immaterial
   something, more or less separable from the material body, and more or
   less identical with the mind or soul, which is the cause of the
   phenomena of living beings. But as science moved irresistibly onward,
   and it became evident that the forces of inorganic nature were neither
   deities nor imponderable fluids, separable from matter, but were simple
   affections of it, analogy demanded a like concession in behalf of vital
   force. From the notion that the effects of heat were due to an
   imponderable fluid called caloric, discovery passed to the conviction
   that heat was but a motion of material particles, and hence inseparable
   from matter; to a like assumption concerning vitality [namely, that it
   also is but a motion of material particles], it was now but a step. The
   more advanced thinkers in science of today, therefore, look upon the
   life of the living form as inseparable from its substance, and believe
   that the former is purely phenomenal, and only a manifestation of the
   latter. Denying the existence of a special vital force as such, they
   retain the term only to express the sum of the phenomena of living
   beings."

   The argument from analogy is presented, as we have seen, in another
   form, by Huxley and others. The properties of water are very different
   from those of the hydrogen and oxygen of which it s composed. Yet no
   one supposes that those properties are due to anything else than the
   material composition of the water itself. So also the phenomena of
   living matter, and of the human brain, are very different from those of
   the elements which enter into their constitution; but this affords no
   presumption that there is any "vital force" or "mind" to account for
   this difference any more than the peculiar properties of water justify
   the assumption of the existence of anything distinct from its material
   element. Vitality and mind, we are told, have no better philosophical
   status than aquosity.

   Dr. Stirling [233] states the case thus: "If it is by its mere chemical
   and physical structure that water exhibits certain properties called
   aqueous, it is also by its mere chemical and physical structure that
   protoplasm exhibits certain properties called vital. All that is
   necessary in either case is, 'under certain conditions,' to bring the
   chemical constituents together. If water is a molecular complication,
   protoplasm is equally a molecular complication, and for the description
   of the one or the other, there is no change of language required. A new
   substance with new qualities results in precisely the same way here, as
   a new substance with new qualities there; and the derivative qualities
   are not more different from the primitive qualities in the one
   instance, than the derivative qualities are different from the
   primitive qualities in the other. Lastly, the modus operandi of
   preëxistent protoplasm is not more unintelligible than that of the
   electric spark. The conclusion is irresistible, then, that all
   protoplasm being reciprocally convertible, and consequently identical,
   the properties it displays, vitality and intellect included, are as
   much the result of molecular constitution, as those of water itself."
   This analogy is two-fold; having reference to chemical composition on
   the one hand, and to the antecedent stimulus which determines it on the
   other. "As regards chemical composition, we are asked, by virtue of the
   analogy obtaining, to identify, as equally simple instances of it,
   protoplasm here and water there; and, as it regards the stimulus in
   question, we are asked to admit the action of the electric spark in the
   one case to be quite analogous to the action of preëxisting protoplasm
   in the other."

   In answer to this argument Dr. Stirling goes on to show that the
   analogy holds only as to chemical and physical properties. "One step
   farther and we see not only that protoplasm has, like water, a chemical
   and physical structure; but that, unlike water, it has also an
   organized or organic structure. Now this, on the part of protoplasm, is
   a possession in excess; and with relation to that excess there can be
   no grounds for analogy." "Living protoplasm, namely, is identical with
   dead protoplasm," says Dr. Stirling, "only so far as its chemistry is
   concerned (if even so much as that); and it is quite evident,
   consequently, that difference between the two cannot depend on that in
   which they are identical -- cannot depend on the chemistry. Life, then,
   is no affair of chemical and physical structure, and must find its
   explanation in something else. It is thus that, lifted high enough, the
   light of the analogy between water and protoplasm is seen to go out."
   [234] Water and its elements, hydrogen and oxygen, are as to the kind
   of power which they exhibit on a level. "But not so protoplasm, where,
   with preservation of the chemical and physical likeness there is the
   addition of the unlikeness of life, of organization, and of ideas. But
   the addition is a new world -- a new and higher world, the world of a
   self-realizing thought, the world of an entelechy." [235] "There are
   certainly different states of water, as ice and steam; but the relation
   of the solid to the liquid, or of either to the vapor, surely offers no
   analogy to the relation of protoplasm dead to protoplasm alive. That
   relation is not an analogy but an antithesis, the antithesis of
   antitheses. In it, in fact, we are in the presence of the one
   incommunicable gulf -- the gulf of all gulfs -- that gulf which Mr.
   Huxley's protoplasm is as powerless to efface as any other material
   expedient that has ever been suggested since the eyes of men first
   looked into it -- the mighty gulf between death and life." [236]

   "The differences alluded to (they are, in order, organization and life,
   the objective idea -- design, and the subjective idea -- thought), it
   may be remarked, are admitted by those very Germans to whom protoplasm,
   name and thing, is due. They, the most advanced and innovating of them,
   directly avow that there is present in the cell 'an architectonic
   principle that has not yet been detected.' In pronouncing protoplasm
   capable of active or vital movements, they do by that refer, they admit
   also, to an immaterial force, and they ascribe the processes exhibited
   by protoplasm -- in so many words -- not to the molecules, but to
   organization and life." [237]

   "Was it molecular powers that invented a respiration -- that perforated
   the posterior ear to give a balance of air; that compensated the
   fenestra ovalis by a fenestra rotunda; that placed in the auricular
   sacs those otolithes, those express stones for hearing? Such machinery!
   The chordæ tendineæ are, to the valves of the heart, exactly adjusted
   check-strings; and the contractile columnæ carneæ are set in, under
   contraction and expansion, to equalize their length to their
   office. . . . . Are we to conceive such machinery, such apparatus, such
   contrivances, merely molecular? Are molecules adequate to such things
   -- molecules in their blind passivity, and dead, dull, insensibility?
   . . . . Surely in the presence of these manifest ideas, it is
   impossible to attribute the single peculiar feature of protoplasm --
   its vitality, namely -- to mere molecular chemistry. Protoplasm, it is
   true, breaks up into carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, as water
   does into hydrogen and oxygen; but the watch breaks similarly up into
   mere brass, and steel, and glass. The loose materials of the watch --
   even its chemical material if you will -- replace its weight, quite as
   accurately as the constituents, carbon, etc., replace the weight of the
   protoplasm. But neither these nor those replace the vanished idea,
   which was alone the important element." [238] There is, therefore,
   something in protoplasm which cannot be weighed or otherwise measured,
   and to which the vital phenomena are to be referred.

   If then the argument from analogy fails in its application to vital
   phenomena, there can be no pretence that it is valid in its application
   to the phenomena of mind. If we refuse to take the first step, even
   Professor Huxley cannot require us to take those which follow.

   Further Arguments of the Materialists.

   Besides the analogical argument, Materialists insist that there is
   direct evidence of the correlation of physical, with vital, and mental
   force. Let it be remembered what this means. Correlated forces are such
   as may be converted, the one into the other, and which are consequently
   in their nature identical. The thing, therefore, in this case, to be
   proved is that light, heat, etc., can be changed into life and thought,
   and that the latter are identical with the former, both classes being
   resolvable into motion of the molecules of matter.

   The proof is substantially this. The animal body generates heat by the
   combustion of the carbon of the food which it receives, precisely as
   heat is produced by the combustion of carbon out of the body. And it
   has been experimentally proved that the quantity of heat produced in
   the body, is precisely the same due allowances being made, as the same
   amount of carbon would produce if burnt out of the body. Vital heat,
   therefore, is identical with physical heat.

   Again, muscular force is produced precisely in the same way as physical
   force. The potential energy of the fuel moves the steam engine. Its
   work or power is measured and determined by the amount of power stored
   in the wood or coal consumed in its production. The source and measure
   of muscular power, are in like manner to be found in the food we eat.
   Its potential energy, derived from the sun as is the case with the
   potential energy of wood and coal, when liberated, produces its due
   amount, so much and no more, of muscular power. Muscular power,
   therefore, is as purely physical, produced in the same way, and
   measured by the same standard, as the power of the steam-engine.

   In like manner, "nervous energy, or that form of force, which, on the
   one hand, stimulates a muscle to contract, and on the other, appears in
   forms called mental," is merely physical. It comes from the food we
   eat. It moves. The rate of its motion is determined to be ninety-seven
   feet in a second. Its effects are analogous to those of electricity. It
   is, therefore, for these and similar reasons, inferred that
   "nerve-force is a transmuted potential energy." This is no less true of
   nerve-force when manifested in the form of thought and feeling. Every
   external manifestation of thought-force, argues Professor Huxley, is a
   muscular one, and therefore analogous to other forces producing similar
   effects. Besides, it has been proved that every exercise of thought or
   feeling is attended by an evolution of heat, which shows that thought
   is resolved into heat. "Can we longer doubt, then, that the brain, too,
   is a machine for the conversion of energy? Can we longer refuse to
   believe that even thought is, in some mysterious way, correlated to the
   other natural forces? and this, even in face of the fact that it has
   never yet been measured?" [239]

   To unscientific men of ordinary intelligence, to men not devoted to the
   study of the sensuous, it is a matter of astonishment that such
   arguments should be regarded as valid. Admitting all the above facts,
   what do they prove? Admitting that animal heat is the same in source
   and nature with heat outside the body; admitting that muscular power is
   physical in its nature and mode of production; admitting that
   nerve-force is also physical; what then? Do these facts give any
   solution of the mysteries of life, of organization, alimentation, or
   reproduction? Do they in any measure account for the formation of the
   eye or ear; for the mutual relations and interdependence of the organs
   of the body? Admitting these forces to be physical; who or what uses
   them? What guides their operation so as to answer a preconceived
   design? Admitting muscular power to be physical, what calls it into
   exercise at one time and not at another; beginning, continuing, or
   suspending it, at pleasure? It is plain that the facts adduced, are no
   solution either of vital or of voluntary phenomena. And when we come to
   thought, admitting that mental action is attended by a development of
   heat, does that prove that thought and heat are identical? When ashamed
   we blush, when afraid we become pale; do these facts prove that shame
   and fear and their bodily effects are one and the same thing? Does
   concomitancy prove identity? In proving the former, do you establish
   the latter? Do the facts adduced prove that shame is heat and heat
   shame, and that the one may be converted into the other? All the world
   knows that sorrow produces tears; but no one infers from this
   coincidence that sorrow and salt water are identical. Even Professor
   Tyndall, one of "the advanced thinkers," tells the Materialists, that
   when they have proved everything they claim to prove, they have proved
   nothing. They leave the connection between mind and body precisely
   where it was before. [240]

   Direct Arguments against the Theory of the Correlation of Physical, and
   Vital, and Mental Forces

   1. They are heterogeneous. All physical forces are alike. They all tend
   to produce motion. They all tend to equilibrium. They are all
   measurable, by weight, or velocity, or by their sensible effects. They
   are all unintelligent. They act by necessity, without choice, without
   reference to an end. In all these respects mental forces are directly
   the reverse. They do not produce motion, they only guide and control
   it. They resist a state of equilibrium. They counteract physical force.
   As soon as vitality is gone, the chemical forces come into play and the
   plant or animal decays. They cannot be measured. Forces which do not
   admit of measurement, do not admit of correlation, for correlation
   involves sameness in quantity. "Thought," says President Barnard,
   "cannot be a physical force, because thought admits of no measure. I
   think it will be conceded without controversy that there is no form of
   material substance, and no known force of a physical nature (and there
   are no other forces), of which we cannot in some form definitely
   express the quantity, by reference to some conventional measuring
   unit. . . . No such means of measuring mental action has been
   suggested. No such means can be conceived. . . . . Now, I maintain that
   a thing which is unsusceptible of measure cannot be a quantity; and
   that a thing that is not even a quantity, cannot be a force." [241]

   Again, vital and mental force act with intelligence, with forethought,
   with freedom, and with design. Wherever the intelligence may reside, it
   is perfectly evident that all vital operations are carried on in
   execution of a purpose. Heat and electricity can no more fashion an eye
   than brass and steel can make a watch, or pen and paper write a book.
   Intelligent force, therefore, differs in kind from unintelligent force.
   They are not only different, but contradictory; the affirmation of the
   one is the negation of the other.

   Professor Joseph Henry.

   Prof. Joseph Henry, of the Smithsonian Institute, is admitted to be one
   of the most eminent naturalists of the age; distinguished not only for
   the thoroughness of his researches, but for soundness of judgment, and
   for the rare gift of being able to appreciate different kinds of
   evidence. He admits the correlation of physical forces, but protests
   against the obliteration of the distinction between them and vitality
   and mind. "The body," he says, "has been called 'the house we live in,'
   but it may be more truly denominated the machine we employ, which,
   furnished with power, and all the appliances for its use, enables us to
   execute the intentions of our intelligence, to gratify our moral
   natures, and to commune with our fellow beings. This view of the nature
   of the body is the furthest removed possible from Materialism; it
   requires a separate thinking principle. To illustrate this, let us
   suppose a locomotive engine equipped with steam, water, fuel, -- in
   short, with the potential energy necessary to the exhibition of immense
   mechanical power; the whole remains in a state of dynamic equilibrium,
   without motion, or signs of life or intelligence. Let the engineer now
   open a valve which is so poised as to move with the slightest touch,
   and almost with a volition to let on the power to the piston; the
   machine now awakes, as it were, into life. It rushes forward with
   tremendous power; it stops instantly, it returns again, it may be, at
   the command of the master of the train; in short, it exhibits signs of
   life and intelligence. Its power is now controlled by mind -- it has,
   as it were, a soul within it." [242] This illustration holds just so
   far as it was intended to hold. The intellect which controls the engine
   is not in it, nor is it affected by its changes. Nevertheless, in the
   body, as well as in the engine, the controlling intellect is equally
   distinct from the physical force, which both so wonderfully exhibit.

   In more direct reference to vitality, Professor Henry says: "Vitality
   gives startling evidence of the immediate presence of a direct, divine,
   and spiritual essence, operating with the ordinary forces of nature,
   but being in itself entirely distinct from them. This view of the
   subject is absolutely necessary in carrying out the mechanical theory
   of the equivalency of heat and the correlation of the ordinary physical
   forces. Among the latter vitality has no place, and knows no subjection
   to the laws by which they are governed." [243]

   Dr. Beale.

   Dr. Beale [244] is equally explicit. He constantly insists that what
   acts voluntarily, with choice to accomplish an end, cannot be physical;
   and that in vital and mental operations there is unquestionable
   evidence of such voluntary action. He says, "I regard 'vitality' as a
   power of a peculiar kind, exhibiting no analogy whatever to any known
   forces. It cannot be a property of matter, because it is in all
   respects essentially different in its actions from all acknowledged
   properties of matter. The vital property belongs to a different
   category altogether." [245] He argues also to prove that organization
   cannot be referred to physical force. "It cannot be maintained that the
   atoms arrange themselves, and devise what positions each is to take up,
   -- and it would be yet more extravagant to attribute to ordinary force
   or energy, atomic rule and directive agency. We might as well try to
   make ourselves believe that the laboratory fire made and lighted it
   self, that the chemical compounds put themselves into the crucible, and
   the solutions betook themselves to the beakers in the proper order, and
   in the exact proportions required to form certain definite compounds.
   But while all will agree that it is absurd to ignore the chemist in the
   laboratory, many insist upon ignoring the presence of anything
   representing the chemist in the living matter which they call the
   'cell-laboratory.' In the one case the chemist works and guides, but in
   the other, it is maintained, the lifeless molecules of matter are
   themselves the active agents in developing vital phenomena. . . . No
   one has proved, and no one can prove, that mind and life are in any way
   related to chemistry and mechanics. . . . Neither can it be said that
   life works with physical and chemical forces, for there is no evidence
   that this is so. On the other hand it is quite certain that life
   overcomes, in some very remarkable and unknown manner, the influence of
   physical forces and chemical affinities." [246] On a former page he had
   said, "In order to convince people that the actions of living beings
   are not due to any mysterious vitality or vital force or power, but are
   in fact physical and chemical in their nature, Professor Huxley gives
   to matter which is alive, to matter which is dead, and to matter which
   is completely changed by roasting or boiling, the very same name. The
   matter of sheep and mutton and man and lobster and egg is the same,
   and, according to Huxley, one may be transubstantiated into the other.
   But how? By 'subtle influences,' and 'under sundry circumstances,'
   answers this authority. And all these things alive, or dead, or
   roasted, he tells us are made of protoplasm, and this protoplasm is the
   physical basis of life, or the basis of physical life. But can this
   discoverer of 'subtle influences' afford to sneer at the fiction of
   vitality? By calling things which differ from one another in many
   qualities by the same name, Huxley seems to think he can annihilate
   distinctions, enforce identity, and sweep away the difficulties which
   have impeded the progress of previous philosophers in their search
   after unity. Plants, and worms, and men are all protoplasm, and
   protoplasm is albuminous matter, and albuminous matter consists of four
   elements, and these four elements possess certain properties, by which
   properties all differences between plants, and worms, and men, are to
   be accounted for. Although Huxley would probably admit that a worm was
   not a man, he would tell us that by 'subtle influences' the one thing
   might be easily converted into the other, and not by such nonsensical
   fictions as 'vitality,' which can neither be weighed, measured, nor
   conceived." [247]

   In the latter portion of his book Dr. Beale shows that the brain is not
   a gland to secrete thought as the liver does bile; nor is thought a
   function of the brain, nor the result of mechanical or chemical action;
   nor is the brain a voltaic battery giving shocks of thought, as Stuart
   Mill conjectures; but it is the organ of the mind, not for generating,
   but for expressing thought.

   Mr. Wallace.

   To quote only one more authority, we refer to the eminent naturalist
   Wallace, the friend and associate of Darwin, and the zealous defender
   of his theory. "If," says he, "a material element, or a combination of
   a thousand material elements in a molecule, are alike unconscious, it
   is impossible for us to believe, that the more addition of one, two, or
   a thousand other material elements to form a more complex molecule,
   could in any way tend to produce a self-conscious existence. To say
   that mind is a product or function of protoplasm, or of its molecular
   changes, is to use words to which we can attach no clear conception.
   You cannot have, in the whole, what does not exist in any of the parts;
   . . . . either all matter is conscious, or consciousness is something
   distinct from matter; and in the latter case, its presence in material
   forms is a proof of the existence of conscious beings, outside of, and
   independent of, what we term matter." [248]

   Vital and Physical Forces not Convertible.

   2. A second argument against the doctrine of the correlation of vital
   and physical forces is that in fact they are not convertible. Motion
   and heat are said to be correlated, because one can be changed into the
   other, measure for measure. But no one has ever changed death into
   life, dead matter into living matter. This Professor Huxley admits. If
   the simplest living cell once dies, all the science in the world cannot
   make it alive. What is dead can be made alive only by being taken up
   and assimilated by that which is still living. The life, therefore, is
   not due to the chemical properties of that which is dead. So far as
   chemistry is concerned, there is no known difference between protoplasm
   dead and protoplasm alive; and yet there is all the difference between
   them of life and death. That difference, therefore, is not chemical.
   Until scientific men can actually change heat and electricity into
   life, and go about raising the dead, men will be slow to believe that
   heat and life are identical; and until they can transmute physical
   force into intelligence and will, they cannot convert "thinkers" into
   Materialists.

   3. Another argument against this theory is the inadequacy of the cause
   to the assumed effect. The doctrine is that the relation between
   correlated forces is quantitive; so much of the one will produce so
   much of the other. But we know that great mental agitation may be
   produced by the mere sight of certain objects, and that these mental
   states may call into action violent muscular force. According to the
   hypothesis, the impression on the nerves of sight or hearing is first
   transformed into mental force, and that again into muscular and molar
   energy. This, President Barnard, who presents this argument, pronounces
   to be absurd, "since it makes a small force equivalent to a large one."
   [249]

   President Barnard further argues against this theory from the fact that
   the mental states produced by impressions on the senses are, at least
   in many cases, obviously due not to the physical impression, but to the
   idea therewith connected. If you insult a Frenchman in English, it
   produces no effect; if the insult be expressed in his own language, it
   rouses him to fury. The meaning of the words is not a physical force,
   and yet it is to the meaning the effect is due. Dr. Barnard says, "when
   it is demanded of us to pronounce as physicists that spiritual
   existence is an absurdity and religion a dream, it seems to me that no
   choice is left us but to proclaim our dissent, or to be understood by
   our silence to accept the doctrine as our own. When such is the
   alternative, for one I feel bound to speak, and to declare my
   conviction that as physicists we have nothing to do with mental
   philosophy; and that in endeavouring to reduce the phenomena of mind
   under the laws of matter, we wander beyond our depth, we establish
   nothing certain, we bring ridicule upon the name of positive science,
   and achieve but a single undeniable result, that of unsettling in the
   minds of multitudes convictions which form the basis of their chief
   happiness." [250]

   4. Physicists cannot carry out their own theory. Even those least
   susceptible of the force of the supersensuous, are compelled to admit
   that there is more in mental and vital action than blind physical force
   can account for. Dr. Carpenter, as we have seen, assumes the presence
   of "a directive agency;" the Germans of an "architectonic principle"
   unknown, and uncorrelated, in living matter, to explain undeniable
   facts for which physical force furnishes no solution. Others, whose
   spiritual nature is not so entirely subjected to the sensible, break
   down entirely. Thus Professor Barker, of Yale College, after devoting
   his whole lecture to prove that vital force and even thought "are
   correlated to other natural forces" (i.e., identical with them), comes
   at the end to ask: "Is it only this? Is there not behind this material
   substance, a higher than molecular power in the thoughts which are
   immortalized in the poetry of a Milton or a Shakespeare, the art
   creations of a Michael Angelo or a Titan, the harmonies of a Mozart or
   a Beethoven? Is there really no immortal portion separable from this
   brain-tissue, though yet mysteriously united to it? In a word, does
   this curiously fashioned body inclose a soul, God-given, and to God
   returning? Here science veils her face, and bows in reverence before
   the Almighty. We have passed the boundaries by which physical science
   is inclosed. No crucible, no subtle magnetic needle can answer now our
   questions. No word but His who formed us can break the awful silence.
   In the presence of such a revelation science is dumb, and faith comes
   in joyfully to accept that higher truth which can never be the object
   of physical demonstration." [251]

   It thus appears, after all, that there is in man a soul; that the soul
   is not the body, nor a function of it; that it is the subject and agent
   of our thoughts, feelings, and volitions. But this is precisely the
   thing which the lecture is devoted to disproving. Thus Professor
   Barker's science gives up the ghost at the feet of his religion. It
   quenches its torch in the fountain of an order of truths higher than
   those which admit of "physical demonstration." The proton pseudos of
   the whole theory is, that nothing is true which cannot be physically
   demonstrated; that is, which cannot be felt, weighed, or otherwise
   measured.

   Wallace, the Naturalist.

   A still more striking illustration of the insufficiency of
   materialistic principles is furnished by the distinguished naturalist,
   Alfred Russel Wallace, above quoted. After devoting his whole book to
   the defence of the doctrine of natural selection, which refers the
   origin of all species arid genera of plants and animals to the blind
   operation of physical forces, he comes to the conclusion that there are
   no such forces; that all is "Mind." Matter has no existence. Matter is
   force, and force is mind; so that "the whole universe is not merely
   dependent on, but actually is the WILL of higher intelligences, or one
   Supreme Intelligence." [252] He holds that instead of admitting the
   existence of an unknown something called matter, and that mind is
   "another thing, either a product of this matter and its supposed
   inherent forces, or distinct from, and co-existent with it;" . . . it
   is a "far simpler and more consistent belief, that matter, as an entity
   distinct from force, does not exist; and that force is a product of
   Mind. Philosophy," he adds, "had long demonstrated our incapacity to
   prove the existence of matter, as usually conceived, while it admitted
   the demonstration to each of us of our own self-conscious, ideal
   existence. Science has now worked its way up to the same result, and
   this agreement between them should give us some confidence in their
   combined teaching." [253] Thus, by one step, the gulf between
   Materialism and idealistic pantheism is passed. This, at least, is a
   concession that physical forces cannot account for the phenomena of
   life and mind; and that in conceding that Materialism as a theory is
   false.

   The great mistake of Materialists is that they begin at the wrong end.
   They begin with blind, lifeless matter; and endeavor to deduce from it
   and its molecular changes, all the infinite marvels of organization,
   life, and intelligence which the universe exhibits. This is an attempt
   to make everything out of nothing. The human mind, in its normal state,
   always begins with God; who, as the Bible teaches us, is an Infinite
   Spirit, and therefore self-conscious, intelligent, and voluntary; the
   creator of all things; of matter with its properties, and of finite
   minds with their powers; and who controls all things by his ever
   present wisdom and might; so that all the intelligence indicated in
   unintelligent forces is only one form of the infinite intelligence of
   God. This is the solution of the problem of the universe given in the
   Scriptures; a solution which satisfies our whole nature, rational,
   moral, and religious.

   All works on Psychology, and on the history of Philosophy, contain
   discussions on the principles of Materialism. Chapter iv. of Dr.
   Buchanan's able work, "Faith in God and Modern Atheism Compared," is
   devoted to the history and examination of that theory. See also chapter
   ii. of the Introduction to Professor Porter's elaborate work, "The
   Human Intellect." Professor Porter gives, on page 40, a copious account
   of the literature of the subject. In Herzog's "Real-Encyklopädie,"
   article Materialismus, an account is given of the principal recent
   German works against the modern form of the doctrine.

   Among the most important works on this subject, besides the writings of
   Comte and his English disciples, J. Stuart Mill, and H. G. Lewes, are
   Herbert Spencer's "First Principles of a New System of Philosophy," and
   his "Biology" in two volumes; Maudsley's "Physiology and Pathology of
   Mind;" Laycock (Professor in the University of Edinburgh), "Mind and
   Brain;" Huxley's "Discourse on the Physical Basis of Life;" his
   "Evidence of Man's Place in Nature" and "Introduction to the
   Classification of Animals:" and his "Lay Sermons and Essays;" Professor
   Tyndall's "Essay on Heat;" "The Correlation and Conservation of Forces:

   Mayer, Dr. Faraday, Professor Liebig, and Dr. Carpenter; with an

   [198] Professor Huxley says: "For these sixteen years, it has been a
   periodical source of irritation to me to find M. Comte put forward as a
   representative of scientific thought; and to observe that writers whose
   philosophy had its legitimate parent in Hume, or in themselves, were
   labelled Comtists,' or Positives,' by public writers, even in spite of
   vehement protests to the contrary. It has cost Mr. Mill hard rubbings
   to get that label off; and I watch Mr. Spencer, as one regards a good
   man struggling with adversity, still engaged in eluding its
   adhesiveness, and ready to tear away skin and all, rather than let it
   stick. My own turn might come next; and, therefore, when an eminent
   prelate of the other day gave currency and authority to the popular
   confusion, I took an opportunity of incidentally revindicating Hume's
   property in the so-called New Philosophy' and at the same time of
   repudiating Comtism on my own behalf." - Ut supra, p. 165. The mistake
   complained of as a very natural one, as Comte and Hume have so much in
   common. Professor Huxley's quotation from Faust is in point here: -
   "Ungefähr sagt das der Pfarrer auch Nur mit ein bischen andern Worten."

   § 5. Pantheism.

   A. What Pantheism is.

   If the etymology of the word Pantheism be allowed to determine its
   meaning, the answer to the question, What is Pantheism? is easy. The
   universe is God, and God is the universe. To pan Theos esti. This is
   not only the signification of the word and the popular idea usually
   attached to it, but it is the formal definition often given of the
   term. Thus Wegscheider says, "Pantheismus [est] ea sententia, qua
   mundum non secretum a numine ac disparatum, sed ad ipsam Dei essentiam
   pertinere quidam opinati sunt." [254] This, however, is pronounced by
   the advocates of the doctrine to be a gross misrepresentation. The idea
   that the universe, as the aggregate of individual things, is God, is,
   they say, a form of thought, which the earliest philosophy of the East
   had surmounted. It might as well be said that the contents of a man's
   consciousness, at any one time, were the man himself; or that the waves
   of the ocean were the ocean itself. It is because so many Pantheists
   take the word in the sense above indicated, that they deny that they
   are Pantheists, and affirm their belief in the being of God. As the
   system which is properly designated Pantheism, does exclude the popular
   view of the subject, derived from the etymology of the word; and as it
   has been held in very different forms, it is not easy to give a concise
   and satisfactory answer to the question, What is Pantheism? The three
   principal forms in which the doctrine has been presented, are, (1.)
   That which ascribes to the Infinite and Universal Being, the attributes
   (to a certain extent at least) of both mind and matter, namely, thought
   and extension. (2.) That which ascribes to it only the attributes of
   matter, Materialistic Pantheism. (3.) That which ascribes to it only
   the attributes of spirit, Idealistic Pantheism.

   General Principles of the System.

   For the purpose of theological instruction it is sufficient to state
   what these several systems unite in denying, and what they
   substantially agree in affirming.

   1. They deny all dualism in the universe. The essential distinction
   between matter and mind, between soul and body, between God and the
   world, between the Infinite and the Finite is repudiated. There is but
   one substance, but one real Being. Hence the doctrine is called Monism,
   or, the All One doctrine. "The idea," says Cousin, [255] "of the
   finite, of the infinite, and of their necessary connection as cause and
   effect, meet in every act of intelligence, nor is it possible to
   separate them from each other; though distinct, they are bound
   together, and constitute at once a triplicity and unity." "The first
   term (the infinite), though absolute, exists not absolutely in itself,
   but as an absolute cause which must pass into action, and manifest
   itself in the second (the finite). The finite cannot exist without the
   infinite, and the infinite can only be realized by developing itself in
   the finite."

   All philosophy is founded, he says, on the ideas of "unity and
   multiplicity," "of substance and phenomenon." "Behold," he says, "all
   the propositions which we had enumerated reduced to a single one, as
   vast as reason and the possible, to the opposition of unity and
   plurality, of substance and phenomenon, of being and appearance, of
   identity and difference." [256] All men, he says, believe, "as it were,
   in a combination of phenomena which would cease to be at the moment in
   which the eternal substance should cease to sustain them; they believe,
   as it were, in the visible manifestation of a concealed principle which
   speaks to them under this cover, and which they adore in nature and in
   consciousness." [257] "As God is made known only in so far as he is
   absolute cause, on this account, in my opinion, he cannot but produce,
   so that the creation ceases to be unintelligible, and God is no more
   without a world than a world without God." [258] It is one of the most
   familiar aphorisms of the German philosophers, "Ohne Welt kein Gott;
   und ohne Gott keine Welt."

   Renan in his "Vie de Jésus," understands by Pantheism, materialism, or
   the denial of a living God. This would exclude all the forms of the
   doctrines held by idealistic pantheists in all ages. Dr. Calderwood
   pronounces Sir William Hamilton's doctrine of creation pantheistic,
   because it denies that the sum of existence can either be increased or
   diminished. Sir William Hamilton teaches that when we say God created
   the world out of nothing, we can only mean that "He evolves existence
   out of himself." Although all the forms of Pantheism are monistic,
   except Hylozoism, which is properly dualistic, yet the mere doctrine of
   the unity of substance does not constitute Pantheism. However
   objectionable the doctrine may be that everything that exists, even
   unorganized matter, is of the substance of God, it has been held by
   many Christian Theists. This does not necessarily involve the denial of
   the essential distinction between matter and mind.

   2. However they differ as to the nature of the Infinite as such,
   whether it be matter or spirit; or that of which both thought and
   extension (potentially) can be predicated; or, whether it be thought
   itself, or force, or cause, or nothing, i.e., that of which nothing can
   be affirmed or denied; a simple unknown quantity; they all agree that
   it has no existence either before or out of the world. The world is,
   therefore, not only consubstantial, but coeternal with God.

   3. This of course precludes the idea of creation; except as an eternal
   and necessary process.

   4. They deny that the Infinite and Absolute Being in itself has either
   intelligence, consciousness, or will. The Infinite comes into existence
   in the Finite. The whole life, consciousness, intelligence, and
   knowledge, at any time, of the former, is the life, consciousness,
   intelligence, and knowledge of the latter, i.e., of the world. "Omnes
   (mentes)," says Spinoza, "simul Dei æternum et infinitum intellectum
   constituunt." [259] "God alone is, and out of Him is nothing." [260]
   "Seine Existenz als Wesen ist unser Denken von ihm; aber seine reale
   Existenz ist die Natur, zu welcher das einzelne Denkende als moment
   gehört." [261]

   5. Pantheism denies the personality of God. Personality as well as
   consciousness implies a distinction between the Self and the Not Self;
   and such distinction is a limitation inconsistent with the nature of
   the Infinite. God, therefore, is not a person who can say I, and who
   can be addressed as Thou. As He comes into existence, intelligence, and
   consciousness only in the world, He is a person only so far as He
   comprehends all personalities, and the consciousness of the sum of
   finite creatures constitutes the consciousness of God. "The true
   doctrine of Hegel on this subject," says Michelet, [262] "is not that
   God is a person as distinguished from other persons; neither is He
   simply the universal or absolute substance. He is the movement of the
   Absolute ever making itself subjective; and in the subjective first
   comes to objectivity or to true existence." "God," he adds, "according
   to Hegel, is the only true personal Being." "As God is eternal
   personality, so He eternally produces his other self, namely, Nature,
   in order to come to self-consciousness."

   It follows of necessity from the doctrine, that God is the substance of
   which the universe is the phenomenon; that God has no existence but in
   the world; that the aggregate consciousness and life of the Finite is,
   for the time being, the whole consciousness and life of the Infinite;
   that the Infinite cannot be a person distinct from the world, to whom
   we can say, Thou. On this point Cousin says, "Take away my faculties,
   and the consciousness that attests them to me, and I am not for myself.
   It is the same with God; take away nature, and the soul, and every sign
   of God disappears." [263] What the soul would be without faculties and
   without consciousness, that is God without the universe. An unconscious
   God, without life, of whom nothing can be predicated but simple being,
   is not only not a person, but he is, for us, nothing.

   6. Man is not an individual subsistence. He is but a moment in the life
   of God; a wave on the surface of the sea; a leaf which falls and is
   renewed year after year.

   7. When the body, which makes the distinction of persons among men,
   perishes, personality ceases with it. There is no conscious existence
   for man after death. Schleiermacher, in his "Discourses," says, the
   piety in which he was nurtured in his youth, "remained with me when the
   God and immortality of my childhood disappeared from my doubting
   sight." [264] On this avowal, Mr. Hunt, curate of St. Ives, Hunts,
   comments: "The 'God and immortality' of his childhood disappeared. The
   personal God whom the Moravians worshipped was exchanged for the
   impersonal Divinity of philosophy. Nor did this theology seem impious.
   No, it was the very essence of true religion." There is good reason to
   believe that with regard to the personal existence of the soul after
   death, Schleiermacher sacrificed his philosophy, as he certainly did in
   other points, to his religion. This, however, only the more clearly
   shows how inconsistent the pantheistic view of the nature of God is
   with the doctrine of conscious existence after death. The absorption of
   the soul in God, of the Finite into the Infinite, is the highest
   destiny that Pantheism can acknowledge for man.

   8. As man is only a mode of God's existence, his acts are the acts of
   God, and as the acts of God are necessary, it follows that there can be
   no freedom of the will in man. Spinoza says, [265] "Hinc sequitur
   mentem humanam partem esse infiniti intellectus Dei: ac proinde cum
   dicimus, mentem humanam hoc vel illud percipere, nihil aliud dicimus,
   quam quod Deus, non quatenus infinitus est, sed quatenus per naturam
   humanæ mentis explicatur, sive quatenus humanæ mentis essentiam
   constituit, hanc vel illam habeat ideam." "In mente nulla est absoluta
   sive libera voluntas. Mens certus et determinatus modus cogitandi est
   adeoque suarum actionum non potest esse causa libera." [266] "Eodem hoc
   modo demonstratur, in mente nullam dari facultatem absolutam
   intelligendi, cupiendi, amandi, etc." [267]

   Cousin says, "We are thus arrived then in the analysis of the me, by
   the way of psychology still, at a new aspect of ontology, at a
   substantial activity, anterior and superior to all phenomenal activity,
   which produces all the phenomena of activity, survives them all, and
   renews them all, immortal and inexhaustible, in the destruction of its
   temporary manifestations." [268] Thus our activity is only a temporary
   manifestation of the activity of God. All our acts are his acts. [269]

   Mr. Hunt, analyzing Spinoza's system, and using mainly his language on
   this point, says, "Spinoza ascribed to God a kind of freedom: a free
   necessity. But to created existences even this kind of freedom is
   denied. 'There is nothing contingent in the nature of beings; all
   things on the contrary are determined by the necessity of the Divine
   nature, to exist and to act, after a certain fashion. 'Nature produced'
   is determined by 'nature producing. It does not act, it is acted upon.
   The soul of man is a Spiritual automaton. . . . . There can be nothing
   arbitrary in the necessary developments of the Divine essence." [270]

   As Pantheism makes creation an eternal, necessary, and continuous
   evolution of the Infinite Being, all liberty of second causes is of
   necessity excluded. A distinction may be made between the necessity by
   which a stone falls to the ground, and the necessity by which a mind
   thinks; but the necessity is as absolute in the one case as in the
   other. Liberty in man is rational self-determination, that is,
   spontaneity determined by reason. But reason in man is impersonal,
   according to Pantheism. It is God as explicated in us. All the acts of
   the human mind are the acts of God as determined by the necessity of
   his nature. The same doctrine of fatalism is involved in the idea that
   history is merely the self-evolution of God. One idea, or phase of the
   Infinite Being, is exhibited by one age or nation, and a different one
   by another. But the whole is as much a necessary process of evolution
   as the growth of a plant.

   Sir William Hamilton, therefore, says that Cousin destroys liberty by
   divorcing it from intelligence, and that his doctrine is inconsistent
   not only with Theism but with morality, which cannot be founded "on a
   liberty which at best only escapes necessity by taking refuge with
   chance." [271] And Morell, a eulogist of Cousin, says, that according
   to Cousin: "God is the ocean, we are but the waves; the ocean may be
   one individuality, and each wave another; but still they are
   essentially one and the same. We see not how Cousin's Theism can
   possibly be consistent with any idea of moral evil; neither do we see
   how, starting from such a dogma, he can ever vindicate and uphold his
   own theory of human liberty. On such Theistic principles, all sin must
   be simply defect, and all defect must be absolutely fatuitous." [272]

   9. Pantheism in making man a mode of God's existence, and in denying
   all freedom of the will, and in teaching that all "phenomenal activity"
   is "a transient manifestation" of the activity of God, precludes the
   possibility of sin. This does not mean that there is in man no
   sentiment of approbation or disapprobation, no subjective difference
   between right and wrong. This would be as absurd as to say that there
   is no difference between pleasure and pain. But if God be at once God,
   nature, and humanity; if reason in us be God's reason; his intelligence
   our intelligence, his activity our activity; if God be the substance of
   which the world is the phenomenon, if we are only moments in the life
   of God, then there can be nothing in us which is not in God. Evil is
   only limitation, or undeveloped good. One tree is larger and finer than
   another; one mind is more vigorous than another; one mode of action
   more pleasurable than another; but all alike are modes of God's
   activity. Water is water, whether in the puddle or in the ocean; and
   God is God, in Nero or St. John. Hegel says that sin is something
   unspeakably higher than the law-abiding motion of the planets, or the
   innocence of plants. That is, it is a higher manifestation of the life
   of God.

   Spinoza teaches that "sin is nothing positive. It exists for us but not
   for God. The same things which appear hateful in men are regarded with
   admiration in animals. . . . . It follows then that sin, which only
   expresses an imperfection, cannot consist in anything which expresses a
   reality. We speak improperly, applying human language to what is above
   human language, when we say that we sin against God, or that men offend
   God." [273]

   It is the necessary consequence of the doctrine that God is the
   universal Being, that the more of being the more of God, and therefore
   the more of good. And consequently the less of being, the less of good.
   All limitation, therefore, is evil; and evil is simply limitation of
   being. Spinoza [274] says, "Quo magis unusquisque -- suum esse
   conservare conatur et potest, eo magis virtute præditus est; contra
   quatenus unusquisque -- suum esse conservare negligit, eatenus est
   impotens." In the demonstration of this proposition, he says, "Virtus
   est ipsa humana potentia," [275] making power and goodness identical.
   Professor Baur of Tübingen, [276] says: "Evil is what is finite; for
   the finite is negative; the negation of the infinite."

   It is only, as just said, another form of this doctrine that power, or
   strength, is in man the only good. This does not mean the strength to
   submit to injury; the strength of self-sacrifice; the strength to be
   humble and to resist evil passion, but the power to carry out our own
   purposes in opposition to the will, interests, or happiness of others.
   That is, that might is right. The victor is always right, the
   vanquished is always wrong. This is only one manifestation of God,
   suppressing or superseding a less perfect manifestation. Spinoza's
   doctrine is, "To the pursuit of what is agreeable, and the hatred of
   the contrary, man is compelled by his nature, for 'every one desires or
   rejects by necessity, according to the laws of his nature, that which
   he judges good or bad.' To follow this impulse is not only a necessity
   but it is the right and the duty of every man, and every one should be
   reckoned an enemy who wishes to hinder another in the gratification of
   the impulses of his nature. The measure of every one's right is his
   power. The best right is that of the strongest; and as the wise man has
   an absolute right to do all which reason dictates, or the right of
   living according to the laws of reason, so also the ignorant and
   foolish man has a right to live according to the laws of appetite."
   [277] A more immoral and demoralizing principle was never expressed in
   human language. To say that it is the duty of every man to seek his own
   gratification, to satisfy the impulses of his nature; that he is an
   enemy who attempts to hinder that gratification; that the only limit to
   such gratification is our power; that men have the right, if so
   inclined, to live according to the laws of appetite, is to say that
   there is no such thing as moral obligation; no such thing as right or
   wrong.

   Cousin repeats ad nauseam the doctrine that might is right; that the
   strongest is always the best. "We usually see in success," he says,
   "only a triumph of force, . . . . I hope I have shown that, inasmuch as
   there always must be a vanquished party, and inasmuch as the vanquished
   party is always that which ought to be vanquished, to accuse the
   vanquisher and to take part against victory, is to take part against
   humanity, and to complain of the progress of civilization. It is
   necessary to go further; it is necessary to prove that the vanquished
   party deserves to be vanquished; that the vanquishing party not only
   serves the cause of civilization, but that it is better, and more moral
   than the vanquished party." "Virtue and prosperity, misfortune and
   vice, are in necessary harmony." "Feebleness is a vice, and, therefore,
   it is always punished and beaten." "It is time," he says, "that
   philosophy of history put beneath its feet the declamations of
   philanthropy." [278] It must, of course, be true, if God is the life of
   the world, all power his power, every act his act, not only that there
   can be no sin, but that the most powerful are always morally (if that
   word has any meaning) the best; and that might is right. This is the
   theory on which hero worship is founded, not only among the heathen,
   but among Christians, so called, of our day.

   10. Pantheism is self deification. If God comes to existence only in
   the world, and if everything that is, is a manifestation of God, it
   Follows that (so far as this earth is concerned, and so far as
   pantheists allow or acknowledge) the soul of man is the highest form of
   the existence of God. As the souls of men differ very much one from
   another, one being much superior to others, the greater the man the
   more divine he is, i.e., the more does he represent God; the more of
   the divine essence does he reveal. The highest step of development is
   reached only by those who come to the consciousness of their identity
   with God. This is the precise doctrine of the Hindus, who teach that
   when a man is able to say, "I am Brahm," the moment of his absorption
   into the infinite Being has arrived. This is the ground on which the
   pantheistic philosophers rest their claim of preeminence; and the
   ground on which they concede the preeminence of Christ. He, more than
   any other man, saw into the depths of his own nature. He was able to
   say as no other man could say, "I and the Father are one." But the
   difference between Christ and other men is only one of degree. The
   human race is the incarnation of God, which is a process from eternity
   to eternity. "Mankind," says Strauss, "is the Godman; the key of a true
   Christology is, that the predicates which the Church gives to Christ,
   as an individual, belong to an idea, a generic whole." [279]

   11. There is only one step further, and that is, the deification of
   evil. That step Pantheists do not hesitate to take; so far as evil
   exists it is as truly a manifestation of God as good. The wicked are
   only one form of the self-manifestation of God; sin is only one form of
   the activity of God. This dreadful doctrine is explicitly avowed.

   Rosenkranz says, [280] "Die dritte Consequenz endlich ist die, dass
   Gott der Sohn auch als identisch gesetzt ist mit dem Subject, in
   welchem die religiöse Vorstellung den Ursprung des Bösen anschaut, mit
   dem Satan, Phosphoros, Lucifer. Diese Verschmelzung begründet sich
   darin, dass der Sohn innerhalb Gottes das Moment der Unterscheidung
   ist, in dem Unterschied aber die Möglichkeit der Entgegensetzung und
   Entzweiung angelegt ist. Der Sohn ist der selbstbewusste Gott." Such a
   sentence as the foregoing has never been written in English, and, we
   trust, never will be. The conclusion it avows, however, is unavoidable.
   If God be everything, and if there be a Satan, God must be Satan.
   Rosenkranz says, that the mind is horrified at such language, only
   because it does not recognize the intimate connection between good and
   evil; that evil is in good, and good in evil. Without evil there can be
   no good.

   It me because of this deification of evil, that a recent German writer
   [281] said that this system should be called Pandiabolism instead of
   Pantheism. He, if we mistake not, is the author of the article in
   Hengstenberg's "Kirchen-Zeitung," [282] in which it is said. "this is
   the true positive blasphemy of God -- this veiled blasphemy -- this
   diabolism of the deceitful angel of light -- this speaking of reckless
   words, with which the man of sin sets himself in the temple of God,
   showing himself that he is God. The Atheist cannot blaspheme within
   such power as this; his blasphemy is merely negative. He merely says:
   'There is no God.' It is only out of Pantheism that a blasphemy can
   proceed, so wild, of such inspired mockery, so devoutly godless, so
   desperate in its love of the world, -- a blasphemy so seductive, and so
   offensive that it may well call for the destruction of the world."

   Pantheism, however, becomes all things to all men. To the pure it gives
   scope for a sentimental religious feeling which sees God in every thing
   and every thing in God. To the proud it is the source of intolerable
   arrogance and self-conceit. To the sensual it gives authority for every
   form of indulgence. The body being a mode of God's extension, according
   to Spinoza's theory, as the mind is a mode of the divine intelligence,
   the body has its divine rights as well as the soul. Even some of the
   most reputable of the Pantheistic school, do not hesitate to say in
   reference to the trammels of morality: "It is well that the rights of
   our sensual nature should, from time to time, be boldly asserted."
   [283] This system, therefore, as even the moderate Tholuck says, "comes
   to the same result with the materialism of French encyclopedists, who
   mourned over mankind for having sacrificed the real pleasures of time
   for the imaginary pleasures of eternity, and the protracted enjoyments
   of life, for the momentary happiness of a peaceful death."

   Pantheism, therefore, merges everything into God. The universe is the
   existence-form of God; that is, the universe is his existence. All
   reason is his reason; all activity is his activity; the consciousness
   of creatures, is all the consciousness God has of himself; good and
   evil, pain and pleasure, are phenomena of God; modes in which God
   reveals himself, the way in which He passes from Being into Existence.
   He is not, therefore, a person whom we can worship and in whom we can
   trust. He is only the substance of which the universe and all that it
   contains are the ever changing manifestation. Pantheism admits of no
   freedom, no responsibility, no conscious life after death. Cousin sums
   up the doctrine in this comprehensive paragraph: "The God of
   consciousness is not an abstract God, a solitary monarch exiled beyond
   the limits of creation, upon the desert throne of a silent eternity,
   and of an absolute existence which resembles even the negation of
   existence. He is a God at once true and real, at once substance and
   cause, always substance and always cause, being substance only in so
   far as He is cause, and cause only so far as He is substance, that is
   to say, being absolute cause, one and many, eternity and time, space
   and number, essence and life, indivisibility and totality, principle,
   end, and centre, at the summit of Being and at its lowest degree,
   infinite and finite together, triple, in a word, that is to say, at the
   same time God, nature, and humanity. In fact, if God be not everything,
   He is nothing." [284]

   History of Pantheism.

   Pantheism has proved itself to be the most persistent as well as the
   most wide-spread form of human thought relative to the origin and
   nature of the universe, and its relation to the Infinite Being, whose
   existence in some form seems to be a universal and necessary
   assumption. Pantheistic ideas underlie almost all the forms of religion
   which have existed in the world. Polytheism, which has been almost
   universal, has its origin in nature worship; and nature-worship rests
   on the assumption that Nature is God, or, the manifestation, or
   existence form of the infinite unknown. Of course it is only the
   briefest outline of the different forms of this portentous system of
   error, that can be given in these pages.

   B. Brahminical Pantheism.

   Ethnographically the Hindus belong to the same race as the Greeks,
   Romans, and other great European nations. In prehistoric periods one
   division of the great Aryan family spread itself westward over the
   territory which now constitutes Europe. Another division extended south
   and east and entered India, displacing almost entirely the original
   inhabitants of that large, diversified, and fertile region.

   Long before Greece or Rome became cultivated communities, and when
   Europe was the home only of uncivilized barbarians, India was covered
   with rich and populous cities; the arts had reached the highest state
   of development; a literature and language which, in the judgment of
   scholars, rival those of Greece and Rome, had been produced, and
   systems of philosophy as profound, as subtle, and as diversified as the
   human mind ever elaborated, were already taught in her schools.

   The Hindus number nearly two hundred millions of souls. They are now,
   in the essential principles of their philosophy, their religion, and
   their social organization, what they were a thousand years before the
   birth of Christ. Never in the history of the world has a form of
   religious philosophy been so extensively embraced, so persistently
   adhered to, or so effective in moulding the character and determining
   the destiny of a people.

   Few questions of the kind, therefore, are of deeper interest than what
   the true character of the Hindu religion actually is. The decision of
   that question is not free from difficulty; and it has, therefore,
   received very different answers. The difficulty in this case arises
   from various sources.

   1. The religious books of the Hindus are not only written in Sanskrit,
   a language unintelligible, except to a small class of learned men, but
   they are exceedingly voluminous. The Vedas, the most ancient and
   authoritative, fill fourteen volumes folio. The Institutes of Menu, the
   Puranas, and the sacred poems, "Ramayana" and "Mahabhrata," are equally
   extensive. The former of these poems consists of a hundred thousand
   verses, and the latter of four hundred thousand, while the Æneid has
   only twelve thousand, and the Iliad twenty-four thousand. Sir William
   Jones said that the student of the Hindu literature and religion, found
   himself in time presence of infinity.

   2. It is not only, however, the voluminousness of the authoritative
   sacred books, but the character of their contents, which creates the
   difficulty of getting a clear idea of the system which they teach. The
   Vedas consist mainly of hymns of various ages, interspersed with brief
   obscure, philosophical or theological explanations and comments. The
   Puranas are filled with extravagant legends; which are to be
   interpreted historically, and which mythically, it is difficult to
   decide.

   3. The spirit of exaggeration is so characteristic of the Hindu mind
   that statements meant to be understood literally shock the mind by
   their extravagance. Thus their books make the earth a circular plane
   one hundred and seventy millions of miles in diameter; they speak of
   mountains sixty miles high, and of periods of four thousand millions of
   millions of years.

   The Religion of the Hindus not originally Monotheistic.

   It is a common opinion that the Hindu religion was originally and for
   centuries monotheistic; that out of monotheism gradually rose the
   present complicated and monstrous polytheism, and that
   contemporaneously among the philosophical class, were developed the
   different forms of Pantheism. But this is contrary to well established
   facts, and is altogether unsatisfactory as a solution of the great
   problem of Hindu life.

   It is indeed true, as we know from the Bible, that monotheism was the
   earliest form of religion among men. And it is also true in all
   probability that the Vedas, which are collections of ancient hymns,
   contain some which belong to the monotheistic period. Most of those,
   however, which appear to assume the existence of one God, are to be
   understood in a pantheistic and not in a theistic sense. These
   recognize one divine Being, but that one includes all the other forms
   of being. The history of religion shows that when monotheism failed
   among men because "they did not like to retain God in their knowledge,"
   it was replaced by the worship of nature. This nature-worship assumed
   two forms. The different elements, as fire, air, and water, were
   personified, endowed with personal attributes and divine powers, giving
   rise to polytheism. Or nature as a whole was the object of worship,
   giving rise to Pantheism.

   It is evident that among the highly intellectual Aryans who settled in
   India, between one and two thousand years before Christ, the
   pantheistic view had obtained the ascendency, not as a philosophical
   theory merely, but as a religious doctrine. It became, and has
   continued until this day, the foundation of the religious, civil, and
   social life of the Hindu. It is this which gives it its paramount
   importance. It stands alone in history. In no other case, among no
   other people, has Pantheism become the controlling form of religious
   belief among the people, so as to determine their institutions and to
   mould their character. The Hindus, therefore, have an interest for
   Christians and for the religious philosopher which attaches to no other
   heathen nation. They show, and were doubtless intended to show, what
   are the legitimate effects of Pantheism. That doctrine has had dominant
   control for millenniums over a highly cultivated and intelligent
   people, and in their character and state we see its proper fruits.

   It was Pantheistic.

   That the religion of the Hindus is fundamentally pantheistic, is
   evident --

   1. From what their sacred writings teach of the Supreme Being. It is
   designated by a word in the neuter gender, Brahm. It is never addressed
   as a person. It is never worshipped. It has no attributes but such as
   may be predicated of space. It is said to be eternal, infinite,
   immutable. It is said to have continued for untold ages in the state of
   unintelligent, unconscious being. It comes to existence, to
   consciousness, and life, in the world. It unfolds itself through
   countless ages in all the forms of finite existence; and then by a like
   gradual process all things are resolved into unconscious being. The
   illustrations of the origin of the world commonly employed are sparks
   issuing from a burning mass; or, better, vapour rising from the ocean,
   condensing and falling back to the source whence it came. Being as
   such, or the Infinite, is, therefore, viewed in three aspects: as
   coming to existence, as developing itself in the world, as receiving
   everything back into the abyss of simple being. These different aspects
   are expressed by the words, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, to which our
   terms, Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer, answer very imperfectly.

   We have here the constantly recurring pantheistic formula, Thesis,
   Analysis, Synthesis; Being. Development, Restoration. The Infinite, the
   Finite, and their Identity. The principal difference between the
   Brahminical system and the theories of the later pantheists, is that
   the latter make the universe co-eternal with God. The Infinite from
   eternity to eternity develops itself in the Finite. Whereas, according
   to the former, there was an inconceivably long period of repose
   antecedent to the process of development, and that process after
   millions of millions of ages, is to be followed by a like period of
   unconsciousness and rest.

   Relation of Infinite Being to the World.

   2. The relation of God to the world, or rather of the Infinite to the
   Finite, is the same in the Brahminical, as in other pantheistic
   systems. That relation has been already intimated. It is that of
   identity. The world is the existence-form of God. God is every thing,
   good and evil; and everything is God. But in very different degrees.
   There is more of Being (i.e., of God) in a plant than in unorganized
   matter; more in an animal than in the plant more in man than in either;
   more in one man, or race of men, than in another.

   Relation of Pantheism to Polytheism.

   3. The vast polytheistic system of the Hindus is founded on Pantheism
   and is its logical consequence. In the first place, as just remarked,
   Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, commonly called the Hindu Trinity, are not
   persons, but personifications, or different aspects under which
   Infinite Being is to be regarded. In the second place, as the Infinite
   Being manifests itself in different degrees in different persons and
   things, anything extraordinary in nature, any remarkable man, is
   regarded as a special manifestation or embodiment of God. Hence the
   frequent avatars or incarnations of the Hindu mythology. In this way
   the gods may be, and have been indefinitely multiplied. Any person or
   thing, or quality, may be deified as a manifestation of infinite Being.
   In the third place, this accounts for the facts that the Hindu gods are
   regarded as destitute of moral excellence, and that even evil, as under
   the name of Kali, the goddess of cruelty and patroness of murderers,
   may be the special object of reverence. In the fourth place, no god,
   not even Brahma or Vishnu, is, according to the Hindu system, immortal.
   All gods and goddesses are at length to be merged in the abyss of
   infinite, unconscious Being.

   Effect of Pantheism on Religion.

   4. Pantheism, as it makes being, God, as it recognizes no attribute but
   power in the objects of worship, divorces morality from religion. It is
   not in the power of any system, however sincerely embraced, to reverse
   the laws of our nature. And, therefore, in despite of the prevalence of
   a doctrine which denies the possibility of either sin or virtue, and
   makes everything dependent on fate, or the power of arbitrary being,
   the people in various ways recognize the obligation of the moral law
   and the excellence of virtue. But this has nothing to do with their
   religion. The great object of all religious observances was final
   absorption in God; their proximate object was to propitiate some power
   by which the worshipper would be raised one or more steps toward the
   state in which that absorption is possible. On this point Professor
   Wilson says: [285] "Entire dependence upon Krishna, or any other
   favorite deity, not only obviates the necessity of virtue, but it
   sanctifies vice. Conduct is wholly immaterial. It matters not how
   atrocious a sinner a man may be, if he paints his face, his breast, his
   arms with certain sectarial marks; or, which is better, if he brands
   his skin permanently with them with a hot iron stamp; if he is
   constantly chanting hymns in honor of Vishnu, or, what is equally
   efficacious, if he spends hours in the simple reiteration of his name
   or names; if he die with the word Hari, or Ráma, or Krishna on his
   lips, and the thought of him in his mind, he may have lived a monster
   of iniquity, -- he is certain of heaven." "Certain of heaven," is a
   Christian form of expression, and conveys an idea foreign to the Hindu
   mind. What such a worshipper hopes and expects is that when next born
   into the world it may be in a higher state and so much the nearer his
   final absorption. As Professor Wilson is not only moderate, but almost
   apologetic in the account which he gives of the religion of the Hindus,
   the above quoted statement cannot be suspected of unfairness or
   exaggeration.

   Character of the Hindu Worship.

   The two leading characteristics of the Hindu worship are cruelty and
   indecency. And these are sufficiently accounted for by the Pantheism
   which underlies the whole system. Pantheism denies the distinction
   between virtue and vice; it recognizes no attribute but power; it
   deifies evil; it "sanctifies vice;" passion, sensual or malignant, is
   as much a mode of divine manifestation as the most heroic virtue.
   Indeed, there is no room for the idea of moral excellence. Hence the
   prescriptions of religion have reference almost exclusively to rites
   and ceremonies. The Brahmin when he rises must bathe in a certain way,
   stand in a certain posture, extend his fingers in a prescribed manner;
   he must salute the rising sun, resting on one foot; he must repeat
   certain words. When he eats, the dish must be placed according to rule;
   he must make prescribed motions with his hands, and so on through the
   whole day. Every act is prescribed, everything is religious; everything
   either defiles or purifies, ceremonially, but of moral defilement or
   purity there seems to be in their religion no recognition.

   The Anthropology of the Hindus.

   5. The anthropology of the Hindus proves the pantheistic character of
   their whole system. Man is only a part of God, a mode of his existence.
   He is compared to a portion of sea-water inclosed in a bottle and
   thrown into the ocean. The water in the bottle is the same in nature as
   that without. As soon as the bottle is broken the water within it is
   lost in the surrounding ocean. Another illustration of the destiny of
   the soul is that of a lump of salt thrown into the ocean, which
   immediately disappears. Its individuality is lost. This absorption of
   the soul is the highest beatification which Pantheism offers to its
   votaries. But this, in the case of the vast majority of men, can be
   attained only after a long process of transmigrations extending, it may
   be, through millions of years. If a man be faithful and punctilious in
   his religious observances, he comes into the world after death in a
   higher state. Thus, a Soudra may become a Brahmin. But if unfaithful,
   he will be born in a lower form, it may be, in that of a reptile. It is
   thus, by these alternations, that the wished for absorption in Brahm is
   ultimately attained. With regard to the sacred, or Brahminical caste,
   the process may be shorter. A Brahmin's life is divided, according to
   the Institutes of Menu, into four periods: childhood, student life;
   life as householder; and finally, the ascetic period. As soon as a
   Brahmin feels the approach of old age, he is directed to retire from
   the world; to live as a hermit; to subsist only on herbs; to deny
   himself all business and enjoyment, that by continued self-negation he
   may not only destroy the power of the body, and free himself from the
   influence of the things seen and temporal, but also lose the
   consciousness of his individuality, and be able at last to say, "I am
   Brahm," and then be is lost in the infinite.

   The Hindu life is dominated by this doctrine of absorption in God after
   a long series of transmigrations, and by the division of the people
   into castes, which has in like manner its foundation in their theory of
   the relation of God to the world, or, of the Infinite to the Finite.
   The Brahminical, or sacred class, is a higher manifestation of God than
   the military class; the military, than the mercantile; the mercantile,
   than the servile. This is popularly expressed by saying that the first
   proceeds from the head, the second from the arms, the third from the
   body, and the fourth from the feet of Brahm. The member of one of the
   lower castes cannot pass into either of those above him, except that by
   merit (ritual observances) he may on his next birth into the world be
   advanced to a higher grade; and one of a higher caste, by neglect of
   the prescribed rule of living, may at his next birth find himself
   degraded into a lower caste, or even into a beast or a reptile. Hence
   the horror of losing caste, which places a man out of the line of
   advancement, and consigns him to an almost endless state of
   degradation.

   The Effect of Pantheism on the Social Life of the Hindus.

   6. The whole religious and social life of the Hindu is controlled by
   the radical principle that all things are God, or modes of his
   existence, and all destined to return to Him again. To a Hindu his
   individual existence is a burden. It is a fall from God. Hence to get
   back, to be lost in the Infinite, is the one great object of desire and
   effort. As this end is not to be attained by virtue, but by asceticism,
   by propitiation of the gods, their religion is simply a round of
   unmeaning ceremonies, or acts of self-denial, or self-torture. Their
   religion, therefore, tends to destroy all interest in the present life,
   which is regarded as a burden and degradation. It cuts the nerves of
   exertion. It presents no incentive to virtue. it promotes vice. It has
   all the effects of fatalism. The influence of the worship of deities
   without moral excellence, some of them monsters of iniquity; the belief
   that cruelty and obscenity are acceptable to these deities, and secure
   their favor, cannot be otherwise than debasing. The world, therefore,
   sees in India the practical working of Pantheism. The system has been
   in unrestricted operation, not as a philosophy, but as a practical
   religious belief, for thousands of years, and among a people belonging
   to the most favored of the various races of men, and the result is
   before our eyes.

   "Greece and India," says Max Müller, [286] "are, indeed, the two
   opposite poles in the historical development of the Aryan man. To the
   Greek, existence is full of life and reality; to the Hindu it is a
   dream, an illusion. . . . . The Hindu enters this world as a stranger;
   all his thoughts are directed to another world; he takes no part even
   where he is driven to act; and when he sacrifices his life, it is but
   to be delivered from it. No wonder that a nation like the Indian cared
   so little for history; no wonder that social and political virtues were
   little cultivated, and the ideas of the useful and the beautiful
   scarcely known to them. With all this, however, they had what the Greek
   was as little capable of imagining as they were of realizing the
   elements of Grecian life. They shut their eyes to this world of outward
   seeming and activity, to open them full on the world of thought and
   rest. Their life was a yearning after eternity; their activity a
   struggle to return into that divine essence from which this life seemed
   to have severed them. Believing as they did in a divine and really
   existing eternal Being (to ontos on), they could not believe in the
   existence of this passing world. If the one existed, the other could
   only seem to exist; if they lived in the one, they could not live in
   the other. Their existence on earth was to them a problem, their
   eternal life a certainty. The highest object of their religion was to
   restore that bond by which their own self (âtman) was linked to the
   eternal Self (paramâtman); to recover that unity which had been clouded
   and obscured by the magical illusions of reality, by the so-called Maya
   of creation."

   In order to show "How largely this idea of the Atman, as the Divine
   Spirit, entered into the early religious and philosophical speculations
   of the Indians," he quotes from one of the Vedas a Dialogue in which,
   among other things, one of the speakers says: "Whosoever looks for this
   world, for the gods, for all beings, for this universe, elsewhere than
   in the Divine Spirit, should be abandoned by them all. This Brahmahood,
   this kshatra-power, this world, these gods, these beings, this
   universe, all is the Divine Spirit." [287] The illustrations used by
   the speaker to show the relation of the phenomenal universe to God, are
   derived from the sounds issuing from a drum or a lute, smoke rising
   from a fire, vapour from the sea. He adds, "It is with us, when we
   enter into the Divine Spirit, as if a lump of salt was thrown into the
   sea, it becomes dissolved into the water (from which it was produced),
   and is not to be taken out again. But wherever you take the water and
   taste it, it is salt. Thus is this great, endless, and boundless Being
   but one mass of knowledge. As the water becomes salt, and the salt
   becomes water again, thus has the Divine Spirit appeared from out the
   elements and disappears again into them. When we have passed away,
   there is no longer any name." [288]

   There can therefore be no reasonable doubt that Pantheism lies at the
   foundation of all the religion of India. There is, indeed, the same
   difference between the present complex and corrupt polytheism of the
   Hindus and the teachings of the Vedas, that there is between the Roman
   Catholicism of our day and primitive Christianity. There is, however,
   this important distinction between the two cases. Popery is a
   perversion of Christianity by the introduction of incongruous elements
   derived from Jewish and heathen sources, whereas the religion of modern
   India is the legitimate and logical result of the principles of the
   earliest and purest of the Hindu sacred writings.

   The most accessible sources of information on the literature and
   religion of India, are the writings of Sir William Jones; the writings
   of Colebrooke; the Journal of the Asiatic Society; the works of Prof.
   Wilson of Oxford, specially his "Essays and Lectures on the Religion of
   the Hindus"; Max Müller's work just quoted. Dr. Duff's "India and
   Indian Missions," and the histories of India, by Macaulay, Elphinstone.
   et al.

   C. Grecian Pantheism.

   The remark of Max Müller, that "Greece and India are the two opposite
   poles of the development of the Aryan man," is strikingly correct. The
   Greek believed in, and lived for the present and the visible; the
   Indian believed in, and lived for the invisible and the future.
   Nevertheless there was a tendency in the higher minds among the Greeks
   to adopt the same speculative views as to God and the universe, the
   Infinite and the Finite, as prevailed in India. With the Greek,
   however, it was a matter of speculation; with the Hindu, it was a
   practical religious belief.

   Speaking in general terms, the different forms of Grecian philosophy
   are characterized by the effort to reduce all the forms of existence to
   unity; to discover some one substance, principle, or power, to which
   all modes of manifestation of being could be referred. Sometimes this
   one substance was assumed to be material; sometimes spiritual;
   sometimes the obvious incompatibility between the phenomena of mind and
   those of matter, forced the admission of two eternal principles: the
   one active, the other passive; the one spiritual, the other material.
   The fundamental principle or idea, therefore, of the Grecian philosophy
   was pantheistic, either in its materialistic, spiritualistic, or
   hylozoistic form.

   The Ionic School.

   The earliest school among the Greeks was the Ionic, represented by
   Thales the Milesian, Anaximander and Anaximenes also of Miletus, and
   Heraclitus of Ephesus. These philosophers flourished from about 600 to
   500 B. C. They were all materialistic in their theories. With Thales
   the one primal universal substance was water; with Anaximenes it was
   air; with Heraclitus it was fire. "It was the endeavour of this oldest
   of the Ionic philosophies, to reduce the origin of all things from one
   simple radical cause, a cosmical substance, in itself unchangeable, but
   entering into the change of phenomena; and this was why these
   philosophers had no room in their doctrine for gods, or transmundane
   beings, fashioning and ruling things at will; and, in fact, Aristotle
   also remarked of the old physiologists, that they had not distinguished
   the moving cause from matter." [289] Of Heraclitus, Döllinger, in his
   able work "The Gentile and the Jew in the Courts of the Temple of
   Christ," says he "meant by his 'fire,' an ethereal substance as primal
   matter, the all-pervading and animating soul of the universe, a matter
   which he conceived to be not merely actual fire, but caloric, and this
   being at the same time the only power at work in the world,
   all-creative and destructive in turns, was, to speak generally, the one
   real and veritable existence among all things. For everything had its
   origin only in the constant modification of this eternal and primal
   fire: the entire world was a fire dying out and rekindling itself in a
   fixed succession, while the other elements are but fire converted by
   condensation or rarefaction into a variety of forms. Thus the idea of a
   permanent being is a delusion; everything is in a state of perpetual
   flux, an eternal-going to be (Werden), and in this stream spirit is
   hurried along as well as body, swallowed up and born afresh. . . . .
   Heraclitus, as any thorough-going Pantheist would, called the common
   soul of the world, the all-comprehending primal fire, Zeus; and the
   flux of perpetual change and tendency to be, into which it enters, he
   termed poetically Zeus playing by himself." [290]

   Cousin says, "For the Ionic school in both its stages, there was no
   other God than nature. Pantheism is inherent in its system. What is
   Pantheism? It is the conception of the universe, to. pa/n, as alone
   existing, as self-sufficient, and having its explanation in itself. All
   nascent philosophy is a philosophy of nature, and thus is inclined to
   Pantheism. The sensationalism of the Ionians of necessity took that
   form; and, to speak honestly, Pantheism is nothing but atheism." [291]

   Cousin frames the definition of Pantheism so as to exclude his own
   system. With him the material universe alone is not God. He believes in
   "God, nature, and humanity." But these three are one. "If God," he
   says, "be not everything, He is nothing." This, however, is as truly
   Pantheism (although in a more philosophical form), as the Materialism
   of the Ionians.

   The Eleatic School.

   The Eleatic or Italian school, of which Xenophanes, Parmenides, and
   Zeno, are the principal representatives, was inclined to the other
   extreme of denying the very existence of matter. Of these philosophers,
   Cousin says, "They reduced everything to an existence absolute, which
   approached nearly to Nihilism, or the denial of all existence." [292]
   Of Xenophanes, born in Colophon 617 B. C., Döllinger [293] says, "With
   all his assertions of monotheistic sound, he was still a Pantheist,
   and, indeed, a material Pantheist, and is universally understood to be
   such by the ancients. Certainly there was present to his mind the idea
   of a being, one and spiritual, embracing the whole complement of
   existence and thought within himself; yet this being was in his view
   but the general nature-power; the unity of God was to him identical
   with the unity of the world, and this again but the manifestation of
   the invisible being, called God, and therefore also he explained it to
   be uncreate, everlasting, and imperishable." It is hard to see how this
   differs from the modern pantheistic doctrine, that God is the substance
   of which the world is the phenomenon; or why Xenophanes should be
   regarded as a materialist more than Schelling or Cousin.

   Parmenides of Elea about 500 B.C. was more of an idealist. He attained
   to the idea of a pure and simple being in opposition to the material
   principle of the Ionic school. This "being," however, was not a "pure
   metaphysical idea, for," says Döllinger, "he so expressed himself as to
   seem to represent it at one time as corporeal, and extended in space,
   at another as thinking. 'To think, and the object of which the thought
   is, are one and the same, was a saying of his. . . . . There was no
   bridge for Parmenides that had led from this pure simple 'being' to the
   world of phenomena, of the manifold, and of motion; and therefore he
   denied the reality of all we see; the whole world of sense owed its
   existence only to the illusions of sense and the empty notions of
   mortal men built thereon." [294] Thus Parmenides anticipated Schelling
   in teaching the identity of subject and object.

   The Stoics.

   The Stoics take their origin from Zeno of Cittium, in Cyprus (340-260
   B.C.). Their doctrine has already been noticed under the head of
   Hylozoism. Döllinger, indeed, says, "The Stoic system is utter
   Materialism, built upon Heraclitic doctrine. It adopted corporeal
   causes only, and is only acquainted with two principles -- matter, and
   an activity resident in matter, from eternity, as power and giving it
   form. Everything real is body; there are no incorporeal things, as our
   abstractions, space, time, etc., have merely an existence in our
   thoughts; so all that really exists can only be known through the
   senses." [295] This judgment, however, is modified by what he says
   elsewhere. It is very plain that the later Stoics, especially among the
   Latins, as Seneca and Marcus Aurelius, regarded the general principle
   which animated matter as having all the attributes of mind. On this
   point Döllinger says, "The two principles, matter and power, are to the
   Stoics but one and the same thing viewed in different relations. Matter
   required for its existence a principle of unity to give it form and
   keep it together; and this, the active element, is inconceivable
   without matter, as a subject in and on which it exists and dwells, and
   in which it works and moves. Thus, the positive element is matter; yet
   conceived without properties; the active one, running through and
   quickening all, is God in matter. But in truth, God and matter are
   identical; in other words, the Stoic doctrine is hylozoic Pantheism."
   "God is, therefore, the world-soul, and the world itself no aggregate
   of independent elements, but an organized, living being, whose
   complement and life is a single soul, or primal fire, exhibiting divers
   degrees of expansion and heat. . . . . God, then, in his physical
   aspect, is the world-fire, or vital heat, all-penetrating, the one only
   cause of all life and all motion, and, at the same time, the necessity
   that rules in the world: but, on the other side, as the universal cause
   can only be a soul full of intelligence and wisdom, he is the
   world-intelligence, a blest being, and the author of the moral law, who
   is ever occupied with the government of the world, although he is
   precisely this world itself." [296] "The one substance is God and
   nature together, of which all that comes into being, and ceases to be,
   all generation and dissolution, are mere modifications. Seneca explains
   Zeus or God's being at once the world and the world's soul by pointing
   to man, who feels himself to be a single being and yet again as one
   consisting of two substances, body and soul." [297]

   The Stoics adopted the Hindu doctrine of the dissolution of all things,
   and the redevelopment of God in the world, after long successive
   periods. "In the great conflagration which takes place after the
   expiration of a world period or great year," all organized beings will
   be destroyed, all multiplicity and difference be lost in God's unity;
   which means, all will become ether again. But forthwith, like the
   phoenix recovering life from his own ashes, the formation of the world
   begins afresh; God transforms himself once more by a general renovation
   into a world in which the same events, under similar circumstances, are
   again to be repeated down to the minutest detail. Many of these great
   catastrophes have already happened, and the process of burning by fire
   will follow again upon this regeneration, and so on ad infinitum. [298]

   This system as well as every other form of Pantheism, excludes all
   moral freedom: everything is under the law of absolute necessity. It
   therefore precludes the idea of sin. "Acts of vice, Chrysippus said,
   are movements of universal nature, and in conformity with the divine
   intelligence. In the economy of the great world, evil is like chaff
   falling, -- as unavoidable and worthless. Evil also was said by this
   school to do the service of making the good known, and yet at last all
   must resolve itself into God." [299]

   Thus the Ionic, the Eleatic, and the Stoic forms of Grecian philosophy
   were in their fundamental principles pantheistic. The two great
   philosophic minds of Greece, and of the world, however, were Plato and
   Aristotle, the one the philosopher of the ideal world, and the other of
   the natural. The latter was the disciple of the former, although in
   most points of doctrine, or at least of method, his antagonist. It is
   only with the views of these mind-controlling men, concerning the
   nature of the supreme Being, and of his relation to the phenomenal
   world, that the theologian as such has anything to do. And this,
   unfortunately, with regard to both, is the point in regard to which
   their teachings are the most obscure.

   Plato.

   Plato united in his comprehensive intellect, and endeavoured to
   harmonize the elements of the different doctrines of his predecessors
   in the field of speculation. "The Socratic doctrine of the absolute
   good and beautiful, and of the Deity revealing himself to man as a kind
   Providence, formed the basis on which he started. As channels for the
   Heraclitic doctrine of the perpetual coming into being and flux of all
   things, together with the Eleatic one of the eternal immutability of
   the one and only Being, the dogma of Anaxagoras of a world-ruling
   spirit was serviceable to him, and with it he had the skill to connect
   the Pythagorean view of the universe, as an animated intelligent whole,
   in a spiritualized form." [300] These are sufficiently incongruous
   materials. An intelligent Deity exercising a providential control over
   the world; the Heraclitic doctrine which involved the denial of all
   reality and resolved everything into a perpetual flow of phenomena; the
   Eleatic doctrine of a one and only Being; and the Pythagorean idea of
   the universe as an animated and intelligent whole. It was not possible
   but that first one, and then another of these elements should be made
   the more prominent, and consequently that the great philosopher should
   speak sometimes as a Theist and sometimes as a Pantheist. Neither was
   it possible that these incongruous elements should be moulded into a
   consistent system. It is not, therefore, a matter of surprise that
   Döllinger, one of the greatest admirers of Plato and one of the ablest
   expounders of his writings, should immediately add to the passage above
   quoted. "Plato never arrived at a finished system, rounded off and
   perfect in itself; nevertheless there is unmistakable evidence in his
   works of a continual progress, an effort after an increasing depth of
   foundation, and a stronger internal articulation, joined to a wonderful
   exuberance of ideas, often excessively bold." [301]

   Plato was not a Theist, in the ordinary and Christian sense of that
   word. He did not recognize the existence of an extramundane God, the
   creator, preserver, and governor of the world, on whom we are dependent
   and to whom we are responsible. With him God is not a person. As Anselm
   and the Realists generally admitted the existence of "rationality" as
   distinct from rational beings; a general principle which became
   individual and personal in angels and men; so Plato admitted the
   existence of an universal intelligence, or nous, which becomes
   individualized in the different orders of intelligent beings, gods,
   demons, and men. God with him was an Idea; the Idea of the Good; which
   comprehended and gave unity to all other ideas.

   Ideas.

   What then were ideas in Plato's sense of the term? They were not mere
   thoughts, but the only real entities, of which the phenomenal and
   sensible are the representations or shadows. He illustrated their
   nature by supposing a man in a dark cave entirely ignorant of the
   external world, with a bright light shining behind him, while between
   him and the light there continually passes a procession of men,
   animals, trees, etc. The moving shadows of these things would be
   projected on the wall of the cavern, and the man would necessarily
   suppose that the shadows were the realities. These ideas are immutable
   and eternal, constituting the essence or real being of all phenomenal
   existence. "Plato teaches that for as many general signs of our
   conceptions as we have, there are so many really existing things, or
   Ideas, in the intelligible world corresponding: to man these are the
   only solid and worthy objects of thought and knowledge; for they are
   eternal and immutable, existing only in themselves, but separate from
   all things and individual, while their manifold copies, the things
   perceptible by sense, are ever fluctuating and transitory. Independent
   of time and space, as well as of our intellect and its conceptions,
   Ideas belong to a world of their own, of another sphere, transcending
   sense. They are not the thoughts of God, but the objects of his
   thought; and, according to them, He created the world in matter. They
   only and God are really existing beings; and therefore earthly things
   have but the shadow of an existence, and that only derived from a
   certain participation in the Ideas, their types." [302]

   The Relation of Ideas, in Plato's Philosophy, to God

   What is the relation of these ideas to God? This is the decisive
   question so far as the theology of Plato is concerned. Unfortunately it
   is not a question easily answered. It is a point about which the
   commentators differ; some saying that Plato leaves the matter
   undecided, sometimes identifying ideas with God, and at others
   representing them as distinct; others say that he clearly identifies
   ideas with God, or includes them in the divine essence; while others
   again understand him as making a marked distinction between God and the
   ideas after which the universe was moulded. It is not easy to reconcile
   what Döllinger says on this subject. In the passage above quoted he
   says that ideas are not the thoughts of God, but the objects of his
   thought. But on the same page [303] he says, "These Ideas are not to be
   conceived as beside and external to God. They are founded in God, and
   God is the all comprehensive Idea, embracing all partial archetypes in
   an unity." He had before said, that with Plato Ideas and God are the
   only "really existing beings." If this be so, and if God is "the all
   comprehensive idea, embracing all others in unity," then God is the
   only really existing Being; and we have pure Pantheism. According to
   Cousin, Plato not only gave ideas a real and proper existence, but, "en
   dernière analyse il les place dans la raison divine: c'est la qu' elles
   existent substantiellement." [304] Döllinger, in commenting on a
   passage in the Timæus, in which "God is styled the Father, who has
   begotten the world like a son, as an image of the eternal gods, i.e.,
   ideas," says, "Had Plato ready intended here to explain the idea of
   procreation as a communication of essence, he would have been a pure
   Pantheist." [305] Plato, however, he says [306] "is no Pantheist;
   matter is, with him, entirely distinct from God; still he has a
   pantheistical bias in his system; for all that there is of intelligence
   in the world, down even to man, belongs, in his view, to the divine
   substance." Plato, therefore, escapes Pantheism only by admitting the
   eternity of matter; but this eternal matter is as near nothing as
   possible. It is not corporeal. It is "something not yet entity."

   As Plato made ideas eternal and immutable; as they were all included in
   the idea of God, i.e., in God; and as they constitute the only really
   existing beings, all that is phenomenal or that affects the senses
   being mere shadows of the real, it can hardly be denied that his system
   in its essential character is really pantheistical. It is, however, an
   ideal Pantheism. It does not admit that matter or evil is a
   manifestation of God, or mode of his existence. Only what is good, is
   God; but all that really is, is good.

   The Cosmogony of Plato.

   Plato's cosmogony and anthropology confirm this view of his theology.
   Nothing has ever been created. All that is, is eternal; not indeed in
   form, but in substance. Matter, something material, has always existed.
   This in itself is lifeless, but it has "a soul," an unintelligent force
   by which chaotic or disorderly agitation or motion is produced. This
   unintelligent force God endowed with a portion of his own intelligence
   or nous, and it becomes the world-soul, i.e., the Demiurgus, the
   formative principle of the world. God is not therefore himself even the
   framer of the world. This is the work of the Demiurgus. This world-soul
   pervades the visible universe, and constitutes one living, animated
   whole. This "world-soul" is individualized in star-gods, demons, and
   human souls. Thus Plato's system makes room for polytheism.

   The Nature of the Soul.

   The soul, according to this theory, consists of intelligence which is
   of the substance of God, and of elements derived from the world-soul as
   distinguished from the nous which did not originally belong to it. All
   evil arises from the connection of the divine element in man with
   matter. The object of life is to counteract this evil influence by
   contemplation and communion with the ideal world. Plato taught the
   preëxistence as well as the immortality of the soul. Its state in the
   present stage of existence being determined by its course in its
   previous forms of being. It is, however, according to his common mode
   of representation, strictly immortal. "Plato's monotheistic conception
   of God," says Döllinger, [307] "is one of the most refined to which
   ante-Christian speculation attained; yet he contributed nothing
   whatever to the knowledge of the perfect, living, personality of God,
   and its absolute and unconditional liberty." His monotheism, it would
   seem, consisted in the acknowledgment of a universal intelligence which
   manifested itself as reason in all rational beings.

   Aristotle.

   Aristotle, although the disciple, was the great opponent of Plato and
   his philosophy. He rejected Plato's doctrine of ideas as chimerical, as
   a hypothesis which was unnecessary and without evidence. In like manner
   he denied the existence of preëxistent matter out of which the world
   was fashioned. He believed the world to be eternal both in matter and
   form. It is, and there is no reason to doubt that it always has been
   and always will be. He admitted the existence of mind in man; and,
   therefore, assumed that there is an infinite intelligence, of which
   reason in man is a manifestation. But this infinite intelligence, which
   he called God, was pure intelligence, destitute of power and of will;
   neither the creator nor the framer of the world; unconscious, indeed,
   that the world exists; as it is occupied exclusively in thought of
   which it is itself the object. The world and God are coeternal; and
   yet, in a certain sense, God is the cause of the world. As a magnet
   acts on matter, or as the mere presence of a friend stirs the mind, so
   God unconsciously operates on matter, and awakens its dormant powers.
   As the universe is a cosmos, an ordered system; and as innumerable
   organized beings, vegetable and animal, exist in the world, Aristotle
   assumed that there are "forms" inherent in matter, which determine the
   nature of all such organizations. This is very much what in modern
   language would be called "vital force," "vitality," "vis formativa,"
   "Bildungstrieb," or Agassiz's "immaterial principle," which is
   different in every distinct species, and which constitutes the
   difference between one species and another. The soul is the "forma" of
   the man. "It is the principle that gives form, motion, and development
   to the body, the entelecheia of it; i.e., that substance, which only
   manifests itself in the body which is formed and penetrated by it, and
   continues energizing in it as the principle of life, determining and
   mastering matter. Thus, the body is nothing of itself; it is what it
   is, only through the soul, the nature and being of which it expresses,
   to which it stands in the relation of a medium in which the object, the
   soul, is realized; and so it cannot be imagined without the body, nor
   the body without it; one must be produced contemporaneously with the
   other." [308] Of course there can be no immortality of the soul. As no
   plant is immortal, as the vital principle does not exist separately
   from the plant, so the soul has no existence separate from the body.
   The two begin and end together. "The really human in the soul, that
   which has come into being, must also pass away, the understanding even;
   only the divine reason is immortal; but, as the memory belongs to the
   sensitive soul, and individual thought depends on the understanding or
   passive nous only, all self-consciousness must cease with death." [309]
   "Thus, then, Aristotle's doctrine of the soul shows that his defect, as
   well as that of Plato, and indeed of all antiquity, was his imperfect
   acquaintance with the idea of personality; and on that head he cannot
   be acquitted of a pantheistic tendency." [310] "His God is not a really
   personal one, or is only an imperfect personality." [311] "The nous, or
   reason, allows souls, with their bodies, to sink back into nothingness,
   from which they severally issued. It alone exists on, ever the same and
   unalterable, for it is no other than the divine nous in individual
   existence, the divine intelligence enlightening the night of human
   understanding, and must be conceived just as much the prime mover of
   human discursive thought and knowledge, as of his will." [312]

   This brief review of the Grecian philosophy in its relation to
   theology, shows that in all its forms it was more or less pantheistic.
   This remark will not be recognized as correct by those, who with
   Cousin, limit the use of the word Pantheism to designate either the
   doctrine which makes the material universe God; or that which denies
   the existence of anything but matter and physical force, which is
   atheism; nor by those who take the word strictly as meaning the theory
   which admits of only one substance, which is the substance of God; and
   which consequently makes matter as much a mode of God's existence as
   mind. Its correctness, however, will be admitted by those who mean by
   Pantheism the doctrine which makes all the intelligence in the world
   the intelligence of God, and all intellectual activity modes of the
   activity of God, and which necessarily precludes the possibility of
   human liberty and responsibility.

   The authorities on this subject are, so far as Plato and Aristotle are
   concerned, of course their own writings; with regard to those
   philosophers whose works are not preserved, or of which only fragments
   are extant, their systems are more or less fully detailed by the
   ancient writers, as Plutarch and Cicero. The general reader will find
   the information he needs in one or more of the numerous histories of
   philosophy; as those of Brucker, Ritter, Tenneman, and Cousin; among
   the latest and best of which is Döllinger's "The Gentile and the Jew in
   the Courts of the Temple of Christ," London, 1862.

   D. Mediæval Pantheism.

   The Neo-Platonists.

   Pantheism, as it appeared in the Middle Ages, took its form and
   character from Neo-Platonism. This was an eclectic system in which the
   Eleatic doctrine of the unity of all being was combined with the
   Platonic doctrine concerning the phenomenal universe. The philosophers
   recognized as the representatives of this school are Plotinus (A.D.
   205-270), Porphyry (born A.D. 233), Jamblichus in the fourth century,
   and Proclus in the fifth. Neo-Platonism was monism. It admitted of only
   one universal Being. This Being considered in itself was inconceivable
   and indescribable. It was revealed, or self-manifested in the
   world-soul, and world-reason, which constituted a trinity; one
   substance in different aspects or modes of manifestation. The world is
   therefore "the affluence of God," as fire emits heat. The soul of man
   is a mode of God's existence, a portion of his substance. Its destiny
   is absorption in the infinite Being. This was not to be attained by
   thought, or by meditation, but by ecstasy. This constituted the
   peculiar feature of the Neo-Platonic school. "Union with God" was to be
   attained by "a mystical self-destruction of the individual person
   (Ichheit)" in God. [313] Schwegler [314] says: "From the introduction
   of Christianity monism has been the character and the fundamental
   tendency of the whole modern philosophy." This remark, coming from an
   advocate of that theory, must be taken with no small amount of
   allowance. It is, however, true that almost all the great departures
   from the simplicity of the truth as revealed in the sacred Scriptures,
   have assumed more or less distinctly a pantheistic tendency.

   John Scotus Erigena.

   The most pronounced Pantheist among the schoolmen was John Scotus
   Erigena. Little is known of his origin or history. From his name Scotus
   and designation Erigena (son of Erin), it has been generally assumed
   that he was an Irishman. It is known that he enjoyed the protection and
   patronage of Charles the Bald of France, and that he taught in Paris
   and perhaps in England.

   His principal work is that "De Divisione Naturæ." By nature he means
   all being. The fourfold divisions which he makes of nature, are only so
   many manifestations or aspects under which the one Being is revealed or
   is to be contemplated. Those divisions are: (1.) That which creates and
   is not created. (2.) That which creates and is created. (3.) That which
   does not create but is created. (4.) That which neither creates nor is
   created. "This division of nature," says Ritter, [315] "is made simply
   to show that all is God, since the four natures are only revelations of
   God."

   Scotus agreed with most philosophers in making philosophy and religion
   identical, and in admitting no higher source of knowledge than human
   reason. "Conficitur," he says, "veram esse philosophiam veram
   religionem, conversimque veram religionem esse veram philosophiam."
   [316]

   The leading principles of his philosophy are the following: (1.) The
   distinction with him between being and not-being, is not that between
   something and nothing, between substantial existence and non-existence,
   but between affirmation and negation. Whatever may be affirmed is;
   whatever is denied is not. (2.) All being consists in thought. Nothing
   is but as it exists in the mind and consciousness. (3.) With God,
   being, thought, and creating are identical. God's being consists in
   thinking, and his thoughts are things. In other words, the thought of
   God is the real being of all that is. (4.) Consequently the world is
   eternal. God and the world are identical. He is the "totum omnium."

   His system is, therefore, a form of idealistic Pantheism. Ritter
   devotes the ninth book of his "Geschichte der Christlichen
   Philosophie," [317] to the exposition of the philosophy of Scotus. The
   few following passages from the "De Divisione Naturæ," are sufficient
   to show the correctness of the above statement of his principles.

   "Intellectus enim omnium in Deo essentia omnium est. Siquidem id ipsum
   est Deo cognoscere, priusquam fiunt, quæ facit, et facere, quæ
   cognoscit. Cognoscere ergo et facere Dei unum est." [318] "Maximus ait:
   Quodcunque intellectus comprehendere potuerit, id ipsum fit." [319]
   "Intellectus enim rerum veraciter ipsæ res sunt, dicente Sancto
   Dionysio, Cognitio eorum, quæ sunt, ea, quæ sunt, est.'" [320] "Homo
   est notio quædam intellectualis in mente divina æternaliter facta.
   Verissima et probatissima definitio hominis est ista: et non solum
   hominis, verum etiam omnium quæ in divina sapientia facta sunt." [321]
   Omnis visibilis et invisibilis creatura Theophania, i.e., divina
   apparitio potest appelari. [322] "Num negabis creatorem et creaturam
   unum esse?" [323] "Creation [with Erigena] is nothing else than the
   Lord of creation; God in some ineffable manner created in the
   creation." [324]

   Scotus translated the works of the so-called St. Dionysius, the
   Areopagite, and in so doing prepared the way for that form of mystical
   Pantheism which prevailed through the Church down to the period of the
   Reformation. The pseudo-Dionysius was a Neo-Platonist. His object was
   to give the doctrine of Plotinus a Christian aspect. He adopted the
   principle of the unity of all being. All creatures are of the essence
   of God. But instead of placing the self-manifestation of God in nature,
   in the world-soul, he placed it principally in the hierarchy of
   rational being, -- cherubim, seraphim, thrones, principalities, and
   powers, and souls of men. The destiny of all rational creatures, is
   reunion with God; and this reunion, as the Neo-Platonists taught, was
   to be attained by ecstasy and the negation of Self. It was this system,
   which, in common with all other forms of Pantheism, precluded the idea
   of sin, which was reproduced by the leading mystics of the Middle Ages,
   and which, when it found its way among the people as it did with the
   Beghards and Brethren of the Free Spirit, produced, as substantially
   the same system has done in India, its legitimate fruits of evil. Of
   the mystical Pantheism of the Middle Ages, however, enough has already
   been said in the Introduction, in the chapter on Mysticism

   E. Modern Pantheism.

   Spinoza.

   The revival of Pantheism since the Reformation is principally due to
   Spinoza; he was born at Amsterdam in 1634, and died at Ghent in the
   forty-fourth year of his age. He was descended from a wealthy Jewish
   Portuguese family, and enjoyed the advantage of a highly finished
   education. He early devoted himself to the study of philosophy, and was
   at first a disciple of Des Cartes. Leibnitz characterizes the system of
   Spinoza as Cartesianism run wild. Des Cartes distrusted the testimony
   of the senses. His starting-point was the consciousness of existence,
   "I think." In that proposition the existence of a thinking substance is
   necessarily included. The outward world produces impressions on this
   thinking substance. But after all, these sensations thus produced, are
   only states of self-consciousness. Self, therefore, and its varying
   states, are all of which we have direct knowledge. It is not all,
   however, that Des Cartes believed actually existed. He was a sincere
   Catholic, and died in communion with the Church. He acknowledged not
   only the existence of mind, but also of God and of matter. Our
   knowledge, however, of God and of matter as substances distinct from
   our minds, was arrived at by a process of reasoning. The validity of
   that process Spinoza denied. He admitted the existence of only one
   substance, and gave such a definition of the word as precluded the
   possibility of there being more substances than one. With him substance
   is that which exists of itself, of necessity, and is absolutely
   independent. There is, therefore, but one substance possible. We come,
   however, everywhere into contact with two classes of phenomena: those
   of thought and those of extension. Thought and extension, therefore,
   are the two attributes of the one infinite substance. Individual things
   are the modes under which the infinite substance is constantly
   manifested. In Spinoza's system there are the three radical ideas of
   substance, attribute, and mode. Of these that of substance alone has
   any reality. The other two are mere appearances. If we look at anything
   through a glass colored red the object will appear red; if the glass be
   blue, the object will appear blue; but the color is not really an
   attribute of the object. Thus substance (the one) appears to us under
   one aspect as thought and under another as extension. The difference is
   apparent and not real. The finite has therefore no real existence. The
   universe is sunk into the Infinite; and the Infinite is a substance of
   which nothing can be affirmed. Of the Infinite nothing can be denied,
   and therefore nothing can be affirmed for "omnis determinatio est
   negatio." The Infinite, therefore, is practically nothing

   A sufficient account of modern Pantheism in its general features as
   represented by Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, and their successors and
   disciples, has been given already at the commencement ol this chapter.
   More detailed information may be found in the numerous recent histories
   of philosophy, as those of Morell, Schwegler, Michelet, and Rosenkranz,
   and in Hunt's "History of Pantheism."

   F. Conclusion.

   The fact that Pantheism has so extensively prevailed in every age and
   in every part of the world, is a proof of its fascination and power.
   Apart from a divine revelation, it seems to have been regarded as the
   most probable solution of the great problem of the universe.
   Nevertheless it is so unsatisfactory, and does such violence to the
   laws of our nature, that it has never to any extent taken hold on the
   hearts of the people. India may be regarded as furnishing an exception
   to this remark. But even there, although Pantheism was the ground form
   of the popular religion, it had to resolve itself into polytheism in
   order to meet the necessities of the people. Men must have a personal
   god whom they can worship and to whom they can pray.

   The most obvious remark to be made of the whole system is that it is a
   hypothesis. From its very nature it is incapable of proof. It is a mere
   theory assumed to account for the phenomena of the universe. If it did
   satisfactorily account for them, and did not contradict the teachings
   of the Bible, it might be safely admitted. But it is not only
   inconsistent with all that the Scriptures reveal concerning the nature
   of God and his relation to the world, but it contradicts the laws of
   belief which God has impressed on our nature, subverts the very
   foundation of religion and morality and involves even the deification
   of sin.

   Had we no divine revelation on the subject, Theism merely as a theory
   could not fail to secure the assent of every devout mind in preference
   to Pantheism. Theism supposes the existence of a personal, extramundane
   God, the creator and preserver of the universe; everywhere present in
   his wisdom and power, directing all events to the accomplishment of his
   infinitely wise designs. It supposes the material universe to be
   distinct from God, dependent on his will, upheld by his power, and
   pregnant with physical forces ever active under his control. It
   supposes that man is the creature of God, owing his existence to the
   will of God, created after his image, a free, rational, moral, and
   accountable agent, capable of knowing, loving, and worshipping God as a
   Spirit infinite in his being and perfections. Although this theory may
   have, for the reason, some problems, such as the origin and prevalence
   of evil, without a satisfactory solution, yet as it meets and satisfies
   all the demands of our nature, and solves the problem as to the origin
   and nature of the universe, it commends itself to the reason, the
   heart, and the conscience with a force which no sophistry of
   speculation can resist.

   Pantheism, on the other hand, does violence to our nature, and
   contradicts the intuitive convictions of consciousness.

   1. We are conscious that we are free agents. This is a truth which no
   man can deny with regard to himself, and which every man assumes with
   regard to others. This truth Pantheism denies. It makes our activity
   only a form of the activity of God, and assumes that his acts are
   determined by necessity as much as the development of a plant or
   animal.

   2. It is intuitively certain that there is a real distinction between
   moral good and evil: that the one is that to which man is bound to be
   conformed, and the other that which he is bound to hate and to avoid;
   that the one deserves approbation, and that the other deserves
   disapprobation, and merits punishment. These are convictions which
   belong to the rational nature of man; and they cannot be destroyed
   without destroying his rationality. Pantheism, however, pronounces
   these convictions delusions; that there is no such thing as sin, in the
   sense above stated; that what we call sin is mere weakness; imperfect
   development, as unavoidable as feebleness in an infant. It goes
   further: it pronounces evil good. It makes the sinful acts and passions
   of men as much the acts and states of God as holy acts and holy
   feelings. There is no good but being; and the men of power are the men
   of being; and, therefore, the strongest are the best; the weak are to
   be despised; they deserved to be conquered and trodden under foot.
   Hence where Pantheism has become a religion the deities who represent
   evil are the most honoured and worshipped.

   3. Pantheism not only destroys the foundation of morals, but it renders
   all rational religion impossible. Religion supposes a personal Being
   endowed not only with intelligence and power, but with moral
   excellence; and to be rational, that Being must be infinite in all his
   perfections. Pantheism, however, denies that an infinite Being can be a
   person; that it is intelligent, self-conscious, or possessed of moral
   attributes. It is just as impossible to worship such a Being as it is
   to worship the atmosphere, or the law of gravitation, or the axioms of
   Euclid.

   4. It is no extravagance to say that Pantheism is the worst form of
   atheism. For mere atheism is negative. It neither deifies man nor evil.
   But Pantheism teaches that man, the human soul, is the highest form in
   which God exists; and that evil is as much a manifestation of God as
   good; Satan as the ever-blessed and adorable Redeemer. Beyond this it
   is impossible for the insanity of wickedness to go.

   5. Man, according to this system, is no more immortal than the leaves
   of the forest, or the waves of the sea. We are transient forms of
   universal Being.

   Our nature is indestructible; as it is impossible that we should not
   believe in our own individual existence, in our free agency, in our
   moral obligations; in our dependence and responsibility to a Being
   capable of knowing what we are and what we do, and of rewarding and
   punishing as He sees fit, so it is impossible that Pantheism should
   ever be more than a philosophical speculation, where the moral nature
   of man has once been developed by the knowledge of the living and true
   God.

CHAPTER IV.

  THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD

   Having considered the arguments in favor of the doctrine that God is,
   and also the various systems opposed to Theism, we come now to consider
   the question, Can God be known? and if so, How? that is, How does the
   mind proceed in forming its idea of God, and, How do we know that God
   really is what we believe Him to be?
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. God can be known.

   It is the clear doctrine of the Scriptures that God can be known. Our
   Lord teaches that eternal life consists in the knowledge of God and of
   Jesus Christ, whom He hath sent. The Psalmist says, "In Judah is God
   known" (Ps. lxxvi. 1). Isaiah predicts, that "the earth shall be full
   of the knowledge of the Lord" (Is. xi. 9). Paul says even of the
   heathen, that they knew God, but did not like to retain that knowledge
   (Rom. i. 19, 20, 21, 28).

   A. State of the Question.

   It is, however, important distinctly to understand what is meant when
   it is said, God can be known.

   1. This does not mean that we can know all that is true concerning God.
   There were some among the ancient philosophers who taught that the
   nature of God can be as fully understood and determined as any other
   object of knowledge. The modern speculative school teaches the same
   doctrine. Among the propositions laid down by Spinoza, we find the
   following: "Cognitio æternæ et infinitæ essentiæ Dei, quam unaquæque
   idea involvit, est adæquata et perfecta." [325] Hegel says, that God
   is, only so far as He is known. The sin against the Holy Ghost,
   according to Hegel, is to deny that He can be known. [326] Cousin holds
   the same doctrine. "God in fact," he says, "exists to us only in so far
   as He is known." [327]

   According to Schelling, God is known in his own nature by direct
   intuition of the higher reason. He assumes that there is in man a power
   which transcends the limits of the ordinary consciousness (an
   Anschauungs Vermögen), which takes immediate cognizance of the
   Infinite. Hegel says that "Man knows God only so far as God knows
   Himself in man; this knowledge is God's self-consciousness, but
   likewise a knowledge of the same by man, and this knowledge of God by
   man is the knowledge of man by God." [328] Cousin finds this knowledge
   in the common consciousness of men. That consciousness includes the
   knowledge of the Infinite as well as of the finite. We know the one
   just as we know the other, and we cannot know the one without knowing
   the other. These philosophers all admit that we could not thus know God
   unless we were ourselves God. Self-knowledge, with them, is the
   knowledge of God. Reason in man, according to Cousin, does not belong
   to his individuality. It is infinite, impersonal, and divine. Our
   knowledge of God, therefore, is only God knowing Himself. Of course it
   is in no such sense as this that the Scriptures and the Church teach
   that God can be known.

   God Inconceivable.

   2. It is not held that God, properly speaking, can be conceived of;
   that is, we cannot form a mental image of God. "All conception," says
   Mr. Mansel, [329] "implies imagination." To have a valid conception of
   a horse, he adds, we must be able "to combine" the attributes which
   form "the definition of the animal" into "a representative image."
   Conception is defined by Taylor in the same manner, as "the forming or
   bringing an image or idea into the mind by an effort of the will." In
   this sense of the word it must be admitted that the Infinite is not an
   object of knowledge. We cannot form an image of infinite space, or of
   infinite duration, or of an infinite whole. To form an image is to
   limit, to circumscribe. But the infinite is that which is incapable of
   limitation. It is admitted, therefore, that the infinite God is
   inconceivable. We can form no representative image of Him in our minds.
   The word, however, is often, and perhaps commonly, used in a less
   restricted sense. To conceive is to think. A conception is therefore a
   thought and not necessarily an image. To say, therefore, that God is
   conceivable, in common language, is merely to say that He is thinkable.
   That is, that the thought (or idea) of God involves no contradiction or
   impossibility. We cannot think of a round square, or that a part is
   equal to the whole. But we can think that God is infinite and eternal.

   God Incomprehensible.

   3. When it is said that God can be known, it is not meant that He can
   be comprehended. To comprehend is to have a complete and exhaustive
   knowledge of an object. It is to understand its nature and its
   relations. We cannot comprehend force, and specially vital force. We
   see its effect, but we cannot understand its nature or the mode in
   which it acts. It would be strange that we should know more of God than
   of ourselves, or of the most familiar objects of sense. God is past
   finding out. We cannot understand the Almighty unto perfection. To
   comprehend is (1.) To know the essence as well as the attributes of an
   object. (2.) It is to know not some only, but all of its attributes.
   (3.) To know the relation in which these attributes stand to each other
   and to the substance to which they belong. (4.) To know the relation in
   which the object known stands to all other objects. Such knowledge is
   clearly impossible in a creature, either of itself or of anything out
   of itself. It is, however, substantially thus that the
   transcendentalists claim to know God.

   Our Knowledge of God Partial.

   4. It is included in what has been said, that our knowledge of God is
   partial and inadequate. There is infinitely more in God than we have
   any idea of; and what we do know, we know imperfectly. We know that God
   knows; but there is much in his mode of knowing, and in its relation to
   its objects, which we cannot understand. We know that He acts; but we
   do not know how He acts, or the relation which his activity bears to
   time, or things out of Himself. We know that He feels; that He loves,
   pities, is merciful, is gracious; that He hates sin. But this emotional
   element of the divine nature is covered with an obscurity as great, but
   no greater, than that which rests over his thoughts or purposes. Here
   again our ignorance, or rather, the limitation of our knowledge
   concerning God, finds a parallel in our ignorance of ourself. There are
   potentialities in our nature of which, in our present state of
   existence, we have no idea. And even as to what we are now, we know but
   little. We know that we perceive, think, and act; we do not know how.
   It is perfectly inscrutable to us how the mind takes cognizance of
   matter; how the soul acts on the body, or the body on the mind. But
   because our knowledge of ourselves is thus partial and imperfect, no
   sane man would assert that we have no self-knowledge.

   The common doctrine on this subject is clearly expressed by Des Cartes:
   [330] "Sciri potest, Deum esse infinitum et omnipotentem, quanquam
   anima nostra, utpote finita, id nequeat comprehendere sive concipere;
   eodem nimirum modo, quo montem manibus tangere possumus, sed non ut
   arborem, aut aliam quampiam rem brachiis nostris non majorem amplecti:
   comprehendere enim est cogitatione complecti; ad hoc autem, ut sciamus
   aliquid, sufficit, ut illud cogitatione attingamus."

   Even Spinoza [331] says: "Ad quæstionem tuam, an de Deo tam claram,
   quam de triangulo habeam ideam, respondeo affirmando. Non dico, me Deum
   omnino cognoscere; sed me quædam ejus attributa, non autem omnia, neque
   maximam intelligere partem, et certum est, plurimorum ignorantiam,
   quorundam eorum habere notitiam, non impedire. Quum Euclidis elementa
   addiscerem, primo tres trianguli angulos duobus rectis æquari
   intelligebam; hancque trianguli proprietatem clare percipiebam, licet
   multarum aliarum ignarus essem."

   While, therefore, it is admitted not only that the infinite God is
   incomprehensible, and that our knowledge of Him is both partial and
   imperfect; that there is much in God which we do not know at all, and
   that what we do know, we know very imperfectly; nevertheless our
   knowledge, as far as it goes, is true knowledge. God really is what we
   believe Him to be, so far as our idea of Him is determined by the
   revelation which He has made of Himself in his works, in the
   constitution of our nature, in his word, and in the person of his Son.
   To know is simply to have such apprehensions of an object as conform to
   what that object really is. We know what the word Spirit means. We know
   what the words infinite, eternal, and immutable, mean. And, therefore,
   the sublime proposition, pregnant with more truth than was ever
   compressed in any other sentence, "God is a Spirit, infinite, eternal,
   and immutable," conveys to the mind as distinct an idea, and as true
   (i.e., trustworthy) knowledge, as the proposition "The human soul is a
   finite spirit." In this sense God is an object of knowledge. He is not
   the unknown God, because He is infinite. Knowledge in Him does not
   cease to be knowledge because it is omniscience; power does not cease
   to be power because it is omnipotence; any more than space ceases to be
   space because it is infinite.

   B. How do we know God?

   How does the mind proceed in forming its idea of God? The older
   theologians answered this question by saying that it is by the way of
   negation, by the way of eminence, and by the way of causality. That is,
   we deny to God any limitation; we ascribe to Him every excellence in
   the highest degree; and we refer to Him as the great First Cause every
   attribute manifested in his works. We are the children of God, and,
   therefore, we are like Him. We are, therefore, authorized to ascribe to
   Him all the attributes of our own nature as rational creatures, without
   limitation, and to an infinite degree. If we are like God, God is like
   us. This is the fundamental principle of all religion. This is the
   principle which Paul assumed in his address to the Athenians (Acts
   xvii. 29): "Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not
   to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone,
   graven by art and man's device." For the same reason we ought not to
   think that He is simple being, or a mere abstraction, a name for the
   moral order of the universe, or the unknown and unknowable cause of all
   things, -- mere inscrutable force. If we are his children, He is our
   Father, whose image we bear, and of whose nature we partake. This, in
   the proper sense of the word, is Anthropomorphism, a word much abused,
   and often used in a bad sense to express the idea that God is
   altogether such a one as ourselves, a being of like limitations and
   passions. In the sense, however, just explained, it expresses the
   doctrine of the Church and of the great mass of mankind. Jacobi [332]
   well says: "We confess, therefore, to an Anthropomorphism inseparable
   from the conviction that man bears the image of God; and maintain that
   besides this Anthropomorphism, which has always been called Theism, is
   nothing but atheism or fetichism."

   C. Proof that this Method is Trustworthy.

   That this method of forming an idea of God is trustworthy, is proved,
   --

   1. Because it is a law of nature. Even in the lowest form of fetichism
   the life of the worshipper is assumed to belong to the object which he
   worships. The power dreaded is assumed to possess attributes like our
   own. In like manner under all the forms of polytheism, the gods of the
   people have been intelligent personal agents. It is only in the schools
   of philosophy that we find a different method of forming an idea of the
   Godhead. They have substituted to hon for ho on, to theion for ho
   Theos, to agathon for ho agathos. It is here as with regard to the
   knowledge of the external world. The mass of mankind believe that
   things are what they perceive them to be. This philosophers deny. They
   affirm that we do not perceive the things themselves, but certain
   ideas, species, or images of the things; that we have, and can have, no
   knowledge of what the things themselves really are. So they say we can
   have no knowledge of what God is; we only know that we are led to think
   of Him in a certain way, but we are not only not authorized to believe
   that our idea corresponds to the reality, but, say they, it is certain
   that God is not what we take Him to be. As the people are right in the
   one case, so are they in the other. In other words, our conviction that
   God is what He has revealed Himself to be, rests on the same foundation
   as our conviction that the external world is what we take it to be.
   That foundation is the veracity of consciousness, or the
   trustworthiness of the laws of belief which God has impressed upon our
   nature. "Invincibility of belief," according to Sir William Hamilton,
   "is convertible with the truth of belief," [333] although, unhappily,
   on this subject, he did not adhere to his own principle, "That what is
   by nature necessarily believed to be, truly is." [334] No man has more
   nobly or more earnestly vindicated this doctrine, which is the
   foundation of all science and of all faith. "Consciousness," he says,
   "once convicted of falsehood, an unconditioned scepticism, in regard to
   the character of our intellectual being, is the melancholy but only
   rational result. Any conclusion may now with impunity be drawn against
   the hopes and the dignity of human nature. Our personality, our
   immateriality, our moral liberty, have no longer an argument for their
   defence. Man is the dream of a shadow.' God is the dream of that
   dream." [335] The only question, therefore, is, Are we invincibly led
   to think of God as possessing the attributes of our rational nature?
   This cannot be denied; for universality proves invincibility of belief.
   And it is a historical fact that men have universally thus thought of
   God. Even Mr. Mansel [336] exclaims against the transcendentalists,
   "Fools, to dream that man can escape from himself, that human reason
   can draw aught but a human portrait of God." True, he denies the
   correctness of that portrait; or, at least, he asserts that we cannot
   know whether it is correct or not. But this is not now the question. He
   admits that we are forced by the constitution of our nature thus to
   think of God. And by the fundamental principle of all true philosophy,
   what we are forced to believe must be true. It is true, therefore, that
   God really is what we take Him to be, when we ascribe to Him the
   perfections of our own nature, without limitation, and to an infinite
   degree.

   Our Moral Nature demands this Idea of God.

   2. It has already been shown, when speaking of the moral argument for
   the existence of God, that all men are conscious of their
   accountability to a being superior to themselves, who knows what they
   are and what they do, and who has the will and purpose to reward or
   punish men according to their works. The God, therefore, who is
   revealed to us in our nature, is a God who knows, and wills, and acts;
   who rewards and punishes. That is, He is a person; an intelligent,
   voluntary agent, endowed with moral attributes. This revelation of God
   must be true. It must make known to us what God really is, or our
   nature is a lie. All this Mr. Mansel, who holds that God can not be
   known, admits. He admits that a sense of dependence on a superior power
   is "a fact of the inner consciousness;" that this superior power is
   "not an inexorable fate, or immutable law, but a Being having at least
   so far the attributes of personality, that He can show favour or
   severity to those dependent upon Him, and can be regarded by them with
   the feelings of hope, and fear, and reverence, and gratitude." [337] No
   man, however, is, or can be grateful to the sun, or to the atmosphere,
   or to unintelligent force. Gratitude is a tribute of a person to a
   person. Again, the same author admits that "the moral reason, or will,
   or conscience of man, call it by what name we please, can have no
   authority save as implanted in him by some higher spiritual Being, as a
   law emanating from a law-giver." [338] "We are thus compelled," he
   says, "by the consciousness of moral obligation, to assume the
   existence of a moral [and of course of a personal] Deity, and to regard
   the absolute standard of right and wrong as constituted by the nature
   of that Deity." [339] Our argument from these facts is, that if our
   moral nature compels us to believe that God is a person, He must be a
   person, and consequently that we arrive at a true knowledge of God by
   attributing to Him the perfections of our own nature.

   Our Religious Nature makes the same Demand.

   3. The argument from our religious, as distinct from our moral nature,
   is essentially the same. Morality is not all of religion. The one is as
   much a law and necessity of our nature as the other. To worship, in the
   religious sense of the word, is to ascribe infinite perfection to its
   object. It is to express to that object out acknowledgments for the
   blessings we enjoy, and to seek their continuance; it is to confess,
   and praise, and pray, and to adore. We cannot worship the law of
   gravity, or unconscious force, or the mere order of the universe. Our
   religious nature, in demanding an object of supreme reverence, love,
   and confidence, demands a personal God, a God clothed with the
   attributes of a nature like our own; who can hear our confessions,
   praises, and prayers; who can love, and be loved; who can supply our
   wants, and fill all our capacities for good. Thus again it appears that
   unless our whole nature is a contradiction and a falsehood, we arrive
   at a true knowledge of God when we ascribe to Him the perfections of
   our own nature.

   Mr. Mansel admits that our nature does demand a personal and moral
   Deity; but, he says, "the very conception of a moral nature is in
   itself the conception of a limit, for morality is the compliance with a
   law; and a law, whether imposed from within or from without, can only
   be conceived to operate by limiting the range of possible actions."
   [340] In like manner he says, "The only human conception of personality
   is that of limitation." Therefore, if God be infinite, he can neither
   be a person, nor possess moral attributes. This is the argument of
   Strauss, and of all other pantheists, against the doctrine of a
   personal God. Mr. Mansel admits the force of the argument, and says we
   must renounce all hope of knowing what God is, and be content with
   "regulative knowledge," which teaches not what God really is, but what
   He wills us to think Him to be. We are thus forbidden to trust to our
   necessary beliefs. We must not regard as true what God by the
   constitution of our nature forces us to believe. This is to subvert all
   philosophy and all religion, and to destroy the difference between the
   rational and the irrational. Why is this contradiction between reason
   and conscience, between our rational and moral nature, assumed to
   exist? Simply because philosophers choose to give such a definition of
   morality and personality that neither can be predicated of an infinite
   Being. It is not true that either morality or personality imply any
   limitation inconsistent with absolute perfection. We do not limit God
   when we say He cannot be irrational as well as rational, unconscious as
   well as conscious, finite as well as infinite, evil as well as good.
   The only limitation admitted is the negation of imperfection. Reason is
   not limited when we say it cannot be unreason; or spirit, when we say
   that it is not matter; or light, when we say it is not darkness; or
   space, when we say it is not time. We do not, therefore, limit the
   Infinite, when we exalt Him in our conceptions from the unconscious to
   the conscious, from the unintelligent to the intelligent, from an
   impersonal something to the absolutely perfect personal Jehovah. All
   these difficulties arise from confounding the ideas of infinite and
   all.

   4. The fourth argument on this subject is, that if we are not justified
   in referring to God the attributes of our own nature, then we have no
   God. The only alternative is anthropomorphism (in this sense) or
   Atheism. An unknown God, a God of whose nature and of whose relation to
   us we know nothing, to us is nothing. It is a historical fact that
   those who reject this method of forming our idea of God, who deny that
   we are to refer to Him the perfections of our own nature, have become
   atheists. They take the word "spirit," and strip from it consciousness,
   intelligence, will, and morality; and the residue, which is blank
   nothing, they call God. Hamilton and Mansel take refuge from this
   dreadful conclusion in faith. They say that reason forbids the
   ascription of these, or of any other attributes, to the Infinite and
   Absolute, but that faith protests against this conclusion of the
   reason. Such protest, however, is of no account, unless it be rational.
   When Kant proved that there was no rational evidence of the existence
   of God, and fell back from the speculative to the practical reason
   (i.e., from reason to faith), his followers universally gave up all
   faith in a personal God. No man can believe in the impossible. And if
   reason pronounces that it is impossible that the Infinite should be a
   person, faith in His personality is an impossibility. This Mr. Mansel
   does not admit. For while he says that it is a contradiction to affirm
   the Infinite to be a person, or to possess moral attributes, he
   nevertheless says that, "Anthropomorphism is the indispensable
   condition of all human theology;" [341] and he quotes from Kant [342]
   this passage: "We may confidently challenge all natural theology to
   name a single distinctive attribute of the Deity, whether denoting
   intelligence or will, which, apart from anthropomorphism, is anything
   more than a mere word, to which not the slightest notion can be
   attached, which can serve to extend our theoretical knowledge." It is
   greatly to be lamented that men should teach that the only way in which
   it is possible for us to form an idea of God, leads to no true
   knowledge. It does not teach us what God is, but what we are forced
   against reason to think He is.

   Argument from the Revelation of God in Nature.

   5. A fifth argument is from the fact that the works of God manifest a
   nature like our own. It is a sound principle that we must refer to a
   cause the attributes necessary to account for its effects. If the
   effects manifest intelligence, will, power, and moral excellence, these
   attributes must belong to the cause. As, therefore, the works of God
   are a revelation of all these attributes on a most stupendous scale,
   they must belong to God in an infinite degree. This is only saying that
   the revelation made of God in the external world agrees with the
   revelation which He has made of himself in the constitution of our own
   nature. In other words, it proves that the image of himself which He
   has enstamped on our nature is a true likeness.

   Argument from Scripture.

   6. The Scriptures declare God to be just what we are led to think He
   is, when we ascribe to Him the perfections of our own nature in an
   infinite degree. We are self-conscious, so is God. We are spirits, so
   is He. We are voluntary agents, so is God. We have a moral nature,
   miserably defaced indeed, God has moral excellence in infinite
   perfection. We are persons, so is God. All this the Scriptures declare
   to be true. The great primal revelation of God is as the "I am," the
   personal God. All the names and titles given to Him; all the attributes
   ascribed to Him; all the works attributed to Him, are revelations of
   what He truly is. He is the Elohim, the Mighty One, the Holy One, the
   Omnipresent Spirit; He is the creator, the preserver, the governor of
   all things. He is our Father. He is the hearer of prayer; the giver of
   all good. He feeds the young ravens. He clothes the flowers of the
   field. He is Love. He so loved the world as to give his only begotten
   Son, that whosoever believeth on Him might not perish but have
   everlasting life. He is merciful, long-suffering, abundant in goodness
   and truth. He is a present help in every time of need; a refuge, a high
   tower, an exceeding great reward. The relations in which, according to
   the Scriptures, we stand to God, are such as we can sustain only to a
   being who is like ourselves. He is our ruler, and father, with whom we
   can commune. His favour is our life, his loving-kindness better than
   life. This sublime revelation of God in his own nature and in his
   relation to us is not a delusion. It is not mere regulative truth, or
   it would be a deceit and mockery. It makes God known to us as He really
   is. We therefore know God, although no creature can understand the
   Almighty unto perfection.

   Argument from the Manifestation of God in Christ.

   7. Finally, God has revealed Himself in the person of his Son. No man
   knoweth the Father but the Son; and he to whom the Son shall reveal
   Him. Jesus Christ is the true God. The revelation which He made of
   Himself was the manifestation of God. He and the Father are one. The
   words of Christ were the words of God. The works of Christ were the
   works of God. The love, mercy, tenderness, the forgiving grace, as well
   as the holiness, the severity and power manifested by Christ, were all
   manifestations of what God truly is. We see, therefore, as with our own
   eyes, what God is. We know that although infinite and absolute, He can
   think, act, and will; that He can love and hate; that He can hear
   prayer and forgive sins, that we can have fellowship with Him, as one
   person can commune with another. Philosophy must veil her face in the
   presence of Jesus Christ, as God manifest in the flesh. She may not
   presume in that presence to say that God is not, and is not known to
   be, what Christ himself most clearly was. This doctrine that God is the
   object of certain and true knowledge lies at the foundation of all
   religion, and therefore must never be given up.

   § 2. God cannot be fully known.

   The modern German philosophers take the ground that all science, all
   true philosophy, must be founded on the knowledge of being, and not of
   phenomena. They reject the authority of the senses and of
   consciousness, and teach that it is only by the immediate cognition of
   the Absolute that we arrive at any true or certain knowledge. God, or
   rather, the Infinite, can be as thoroughly known and comprehended as
   the simplest object of sense or of consciousness; He is, only so far as
   He is known.

   It would seem impossible that the presumption of men should be so
   extreme that such a creature as man should pretend to understand the
   Almighty to perfection, when in fact he cannot understand himself or
   the simplest objects with which he is in daily contact. The assumption
   is that being, as such, Infinite and Absolute Being, can be known; that
   is, that we can determine what it is, and the necessary laws by which
   it is developed into the phenomenal world. This knowledge is attained à
   priori; not by any induction or deduction from our own nature or the
   facts of experience, but by an immediate act of cognition, which
   transcends all consciousness. The great service rendered by Sir William
   Hamilton and Mr. Mansel to the cause of truth was to demonstrate the
   utter futility of this pretended philosophy of the Infinite, on the
   principles of its advocates. To the common mind it needed no
   refutation, being intuitively seen to be impossible and absurd.

   Sir William Hamilton's Argument.

   Hamilton shows, in the first place, that the immediate intuition of
   Schelling, which Hegel ridiculed as a mere imagination, the dialectics
   of Hegel, which Schelling pronounced a mere play of words, and the
   impersonal reason of Cousin which enters into our consciousness but not
   into our personality, utterly fail to give us a knowledge of the
   Infinite. "Existence," he says, "is revealed to us only under specific
   modifications, and these are known only under the conditions of our
   faculties of knowledge. Things in themselves, matter, mind, God, all in
   short that is not finite, relative, and phenomenal, as bearing no
   analogy to our faculties, is beyond the verge of our our knowledge."
   [343] In what sense Hamilton places God "beyond the verge of our
   knowledge" will be seen in the sequel. It is, however, self-evident
   that our knowledge must be limited by our faculties of knowing. Other
   animals may have senses which we do not possess. It is utterly
   impossible that we should have the kind of knowledge due to the
   exercise of those senses. It is probable that there are faculties
   dormant in our nature which are not called into activity in our present
   state of being. It is clear that we cannot now attain the knowledge
   which those faculties may hereafter enable us to attain. It is just as
   plain that we cannot cognize the Infinite, in the sense of these
   philosophers, as that we cannot see a spirit, or guide ourselves in
   space, as does the carrier-pigeon or the migrating salmon.

   Only the Infinite can know the Infinite.

   2. In the second place, it is admitted that none but the Infinite can
   know the Infinite, and to know God in this sense, it is admitted that
   we must be God. "Schelling claimed for the mind of man, what Kant had
   demonstrated to be impossible, a faculty of intellectual intuition
   which is apart from sense, above consciousness, and released from the
   laws of the understanding, and which comprehends the absolute by
   becoming the absolute, and thus knows God by being God." [344] This
   assumption that man is God, shocks the reason and common sense of men
   as well as outrages their religious and moral convictions.

   3. In the third place, Hamilton and Mansel demonstrate that, assuming
   the definitions of the Absolute and Infinite given by the
   transcendentalists, the most contradictory conclusions may logically be
   deduced from them. "There are three terms familiar as household words
   in the vocabulary of philosophy, which must be taken into account in
   every system of metaphysical theology. To conceive the Deity as He is,
   we must conceive him as First Cause, as absolute, and as infinite. By
   First Cause, is meant that which produces all things, and is itself
   produced of none. By the Absolute, is meant that which exists in and by
   itself, having no necessary relation to any other being. By the
   Infinite, is meant that which is free from all possible limitation;
   that than which a greater is inconceivable, and which, consequently,
   can receive no additional attribute or mode of existence which it had
   not from all eternity." [345]

   According to these definitions, in the sense in which they are intended
   to be taken, it follows: --

   1. That the Infinite and Absolute must include the sum of all being.
   For "that which is conceived as absolute and infinite must be conceived
   as containing within itself the sum, not only of all actual, but of all
   possible modes of being. For if any actual mode can be denied of it, it
   is related to that mode and limited by it; and if any possible mode can
   be denied of it, it is capable of becoming more than it now is, and
   such a capability is a limitation." [346]

   2. If the Absolute and Infinite be as above defined, it cannot be the
   object of knowledge. To know is to limit. It is to distinguish the
   object of knowledge from other objects. We cannot conceive, says
   Hamilton, of an absolute whole; i.e., of a whole so great that we
   cannot conceive of it as a part of a greater whole. We cannot conceive
   of an infinite line, or of infinite space, or of infinite duration. We
   may as well think without thought, as to assign any limit beyond which
   there can be no extension, no space, no duration. "Goad imagination to
   the utmost, it still sinks paralyzed within the bounds of time." [347]
   It follows, therefore, from the very nature of knowledge, according to
   Hamilton, that the Infinite and Absolute cannot be known.

   The Infinite cannot Know.

   3. It also follows from these premises, that the Infinite cannot know.
   All knowledge is limitation and difference. It supposes a distinction
   between subject and object, between the knower and what is known,
   inconsistent with the idea of the Absolute.

   4. It follows also that the Absolute cannot be conscious, for
   consciousness involves a distinction between the self and the not-self.
   It is knowledge of ourselves as distinct from what is not ourselves.
   Even if conscious only of itself; there is the same distinction between
   subject and object; the self as subject and a mode of the self as the
   object of consciousness. "The almost unanimous voice of philosophy,"
   says Mansel, "in pronouncing that the Absolute is both one and simple
   must be accepted as the voice of reason also, so far as reason has any
   voice in the matter." "The conception of an absolute and infinite
   consciousness contradicts itself." [348]

   The Absolute cannot be Cause.

   5. It is equally clear that the Absolute and Infinite cannot be cause.
   Causation implies relation; the relation of efficiency to the effect.
   It also implies change; change from inaction to activity. It moreover
   implies succession, and succession implies existence in time. "A thing
   existing absolutely (i.e., not under relation)," says Hamilton, "and a
   thing existing absolutely as a cause, are contradictory." He quotes
   Schelling [349] as saying, "He would deviate wide as the poles from the
   idea of the Absolute, who would think of defining its nature by the
   notion of activity." "But he who would define the Absolute by the
   notion of a cause," he adds, "would deviate still more widely from its
   nature, inasmuch as the notion of a cause involves not only the notion
   of a determination to activity, but of a determination to a particular,
   nay a dependent, kind of activity." [350] "The three conceptions, the
   Cause, the Absolute, the Infinite, all equally indispensable, do they
   not," asks Mr. Mansel, [351] "imply contradiction to each other, when
   viewed in conjunction, as attributes of one and the same Being? A cause
   cannot, as such, be absolute: the Absolute cannot, as such, be cause."

   6. According to the laws of our reason and consciousness, there can be
   no duration without succession, but succession as implying change
   cannot be predicated of the Absolute and Infinite, and yet without
   succession there can be no thought or consciousness; and, therefore, to
   say that God is eternal is to deny that He has either thought or
   consciousness.

   7. Again, "Benevolence, holiness, justice, wisdom," says Mansel, "can
   be conceived by us only as existing in a benevolent and holy and just
   and wise being, who is not identical with any one of his attributes,
   but the common subject of them all; in one word, in a person. But
   personality, as we conceive it, is essentially a limitation and a
   relation. -- To speak of an absolute and infinite persons is simply to
   use language to which, however true it may be in a superhuman sense, no
   mode of human thought can possibly attach itself." [352]

   The Conclusion to which Hamilton's Argument leads.

   What then is the result of the whole matter? It is, that if the
   definitions of the Absolute and Infinite adopted by transcendentalists
   be admitted, the laws of reason lead us into a labyrinth of
   contradictions. If their idea of an infinite and absolute Being be
   correct, then it must include all being actual and possible; it can
   neither know nor be the object of knowledge; it cannot be conscious, or
   cause, or a person, or the subject of any moral attribute. Hamilton
   infers from all this, that a philosophy of the Absolute is a sheer
   impossibility; that the Absolute, from its nature and from the
   necessary limits of human thought, is unknowable, and consequently that
   the stupendous systems of pantheistic atheism which had been erected on
   the contrary assumption, must fall to the ground. Those systems have
   indeed already fallen by their own weight. Although only a few years
   ago they claimed the homage of the intellectual world and boasted of
   immutability, they have at the present time scarcely a living advocate.

   Unhappily, however, Hamilton, like Samson, is involved in the ruin
   which he created. In overthrowing pantheism he overthrows Theism. All
   that he says of the Absolute as unknowable, he affirms to be true of
   God. All the contradictions which attend the assumption of an absolute
   and infinite being as the ground of philosophy, he says attend the
   assumption of an infinite God.

   § 3. Hamilton's Doctrine.

   A. God an Object of Faith, but not of Knowledge.

   The sense in which Hamilton and his followers represent God as
   unknowable, has been a matter of dispute. When he says that we can know
   that God is, but not what He is, he says only what had been said a
   hundred times before. Plato had said that the search after God was
   difficult, and that when He is found, it is impossible to declare his
   nature. Philo still more explicitly teaches that the divine essence is
   without qualities or attributes, and as we know nothing of any essence
   but by its distinguishing attributes. God in his own nature is
   altogether unknowable. [353] This is repeated continually by the Greek
   and Latin fathers; who, however, in most cases at least, meant nothing
   more than that God is incomprehensible. Others again, in asserting the
   incapacity of man to know God, refer to his spiritual blindness
   occasioned by sin. Therefore, while they deny that God can be known by
   the unregenerate, they affirm that He is known by those to whom the Son
   has revealed Him. In like manner although the Apostle asserts that even
   the heathen know God, he elsewhere speaks of a kind of knowledge due to
   the saving illumination of the Holy Spirit. It is in the sense that God
   is past finding out that the devout Pascal says, [354] "We know there
   is an infinite, but we are ignorant of its nature. . . . . We may well
   know that there is a God, without knowing what He is." And even John
   Owen says, "All the rational conceptions of the minds of men are
   swallowed up and lost, when they would exercise themselves directly on
   that which is absolute, immense, eternal, and infinite. When we say it
   is so, we know not what we say, but only that it is not otherwise. What
   we deny of God we know in some measure -- but what we affirm we know
   not; only we declare what we believe and adore." [355] Professor Tyler
   adds, that while the philosophy of Hamilton "confines our knowledge to
   the conditioned [the finite], it leaves faith free about the
   unconditioned [the infinite]; indeed constrains us to believe in it by
   the highest law of our intelligence."

   Although Hamilton often uses the same language when speaking of God as
   unknowable, as that employed by others, his meaning is very different.
   He really teaches an ignorance of God destructive of all rational
   religion, because inconsistent with the possibility of faith.

   Different Kinds of Ignorance.

   There are different kinds of ignorance. First, there is the ignorance
   of the idiot, which is blank vacuity. In him the statement of a
   proposition awakens no mental action whatever. Secondly, there is the
   ignorance of a blind man, of colour. He does not know what colour is;
   but he knows there is something which answers to that word and which
   produces a certain effect on the eyes of those who see. He may even
   understand the laws by which the production of colour is determined. A
   blind man has written a treatise on optics. Thirdly, there is the
   ignorance under which the mind labors when it can prove contradictory
   propositions concerning the same object, as that the same figure is
   both square and round And fourthly, there is the ignorance of imperfect
   knowledge. Paul speaks of knowing what passes knowledge.

   Our ignorance of God, according to Hamilton, is neither the ignorance
   of the idiot nor of imperfect knowledge, but it is analogous to the
   ignorance of a blind man of colours, and more definitely, the ignorance
   we labor under with regard to any object of which we can prove
   contradictions.

   Proof that Hamilton Denies that we can Know God.

   That this view of his doctrine is correct is proved, (1.) Because he
   asserts in such broad terms that God cannot be known; that He is not
   only inconceivable, but incogitable. (2.) Because, he says, that we
   know that God is not, and cannot be, what we think He is. It is not
   merely that we cannot determine with certainty that our idea of God is
   correct, but we know that it is not correct. "To think that God is, as
   we can think Him to be," he says, "is blasphemy. The last and highest
   consecration of all true religion, must be an altar, Agnosto Theo, To
   the unknown and unknowable God.'" [356] (3.) Because both he and Mansel
   continually assert that the Infinite cannot be a person; cannot know;
   cannot be cause; cannot be conscious; cannot be the subject of any
   moral attributes. To think of God as infinite, and to think of Him as a
   person is an impossibility. (4.) The illustrations which these writers
   employ determine clearly their meaning. Our ignorance of God is
   compared to our incapacity to conceive of two straight lines inclosing
   a portion of space; or to think "a circular parallelogram." It is not
   merely that we cannot understand such a figure, but we see that, in the
   nature of things, any such figure is impossible. So we not only cannot
   understand how God can be absolute and yet a person, but we see that an
   absolute person is as much a contradiction as a square circle. (5.)
   Accordingly Herbert Spencer and others, in carrying out Hamilton's
   principles, come to the conclusion not only that we cannot know God,
   but that it is impossible that a personal God should exist. There can
   be no such being.

   Hamilton's Doctrine of God as an object of Faith.

   Hamilton and Mansel, however, are not only Theists, but Christians.
   They believe in God, and they believe in the Scriptures as a divine
   revelation. They endeavor to avoid what seem to be the inevitable
   consequences of their doctrine, by adopting two principles: first, that
   the unthinkable is possible, and, therefore, may be believed. By the
   unthinkable is meant that which the laws of reason force us to regard
   as self-contradictory. On this subject Mansel says: "It is our duty to
   think of God as personal, and it is our duty to believe that He is
   infinite. It is true that we cannot reconcile these two representations
   with each other; as our conception of personality involves attributes
   apparently contradictory to the notion of infinity. But it does not
   follow that this contradiction exists anywhere but in our own minds: it
   does not follow that it implies any impossibility in the absolute
   nature of God. . . . . It proves that there are limits to man's power
   of thought; and it proves no more." [357] The conclusion is, that as
   whatever is possible is credible, therefore, as it is possible that God
   though infinite may be a person, his personality may be rationally
   believed.

   The Unthinkable, or Impossible, cannot be an object of Faith.

   On this it may be remarked, --

   1. That there is a great difference between the irreconcilable and the
   self-contradictory. In the one case the difficulty arises, or may
   arise, out of our ignorance or mental weakness; in the other, it arises
   out of the nature of the things themselves. Many things are
   irreconcilable to a child which are not so to a man. Many things are
   irreconcilable to one man and not to another; to men and not to angels.
   But the self-contradictory is impossible, and is seen to be so by all
   orders of mind. That two and two should make twenty, or that the same
   figure should be a square and a circle, is just as irreconcilable to an
   angel as to a child. What is self-contradictory cannot possibly be
   true. Now, according to Hamilton and Mansel, infinity and personality
   are not only irreconcilable, but contradictory. The one affirms what
   the other denies. According to their doctrine the Infinite cannot be a
   person, and a person cannot be infinite, any more than the Infinite can
   be finite, or the finite infinite. The one of necessity excludes the
   other. If you affirm the one, you deny the other. There is a great
   difference between not seeing how a thing is, and clearly seeing that
   it cannot be. Hamilton and Mansel constantly assert that an absolute
   person is a contradiction in terms. And so it is, if their definition
   of the absolute be correct; and if a contradiction, it is impossible.

   2. If to our reason the personality of an infinite God be a
   contradiction, then it is impossible rationally to believe that He is a
   person. It is in vain to say that the contradiction is only in our
   mind. So is faith in our mind. It is impossible for one and the same
   mind to see a thing to be false, and believe it to be true. For the
   reason to see that a thing is a contradiction, is to see it to be
   false; and to see it to be false, and to believe it to be true, is a
   contradiction in terms. Even if to other and higher minds the
   contradiction does not exist, so long as it exists in the view of any
   particular mind, for that mind faith in its truth is an impossibility.

   It may be said that a man's reason may convince him that the external
   world does not really exist, while his senses force him to believe in
   its reality. So reason may pronounce the personality of God a
   contradiction, and conscience force us to believe that He is a person.
   This is to confound consecutive with contemporaneous states of mind. It
   is possible for a man to be an idealist in his study, and a realist out
   of doors. But he cannot be an idealist and a realist at one and the
   same time. The mind is a unit. A man's reason is the man himself; so is
   his conscience, and so are all his other faculties. It is the one
   substantive self that thinks and believes. To assume, therefore, that
   by necessity he must think one way and believe another; that the laws
   of his reason force him to regard as false what his conscience or
   senses force him to regard as true, is to destroy his rationality. It
   is also to impugn the wisdom and goodness of our Creator, for it
   supposes Him to have put one part of our constitution in conflict with
   another; to have placed us under guides who alternately force us to
   move in opposite directions. It even places this contradiction in God
   himself. For what reason, in its legitimate exercise, says, God says;
   and what conscience, in its legitimate exercise, says, God says. If,
   therefore, reason says that God is not a person, and conscience says
   that He is, then -- with reverence be it spoken -- God contradicts
   Himself.

   Knowledge essential to Faith.

   It is one of the distinguishing doctrines of Protestants that knowledge
   is essential to faith. This is clearly the doctrine of Scripture. How
   can they believe on Him of whom they have not heard? is the pertinent
   and instructive query of the Apostle. Faith includes the affirmation of
   the mind that a thing is true and trustworthy. But it is impossible for
   the mind to affirm anything of that of which it knows nothing.
   Romanists indeed say that if a man believes that the Church teaches the
   truth, then he believes all the Church teaches, although ignorant of
   its doctrines. It might as well be said that because a child has
   confidence in his father, therefore he knows all his father knows.
   Truth must be communicated to the mind, and seen to be possible,
   before, on any evidence, it can be believed. If, therefore, we cannot
   know God, we cannot believe in Him.

   B. Regulative Knowledge.

   The second principle which Hamilton and Mansel adopt to save themselves
   from scepticism is that of regulative knowledge. We are bound to
   believe that God is what the Scriptures and our moral nature declare
   Him to be. This revelation, however, does not teach us what God really
   is, but merely what He wills us to believe concerning Him. Our senses,
   they say, tell us that things around us are, but not what they are. We
   can, however, safely act on the assumption that they really are what
   they appear to be. Our senses, therefore, give only regulative
   knowledge; i.e., knowledge sufficient to regulate our active life. So
   we do not, and cannot, know what God really is; but the representations
   contained in the Scriptures are sufficient to regulate our moral and
   religious life. We can safely act on the assumption that He really is
   what we are thus led to think Him to be, although we know that such is
   not the fact.

   We must be "content," says Mansel, [358] "with those regulative ideas
   of the Deity, which are sufficient to guide our practice, but not to
   satisfy our intellect, -- which tell us not what God is in Himself, but
   how He wills that we should think of Him." "Though this kind of
   knowledge," says Hampden, [359] "is abundantly instructive to us in
   point of sentiment and action; teaches us, that is, both how to feel,
   and how to act towards God; -- for it is the language that we
   understand, the language formed by our own experience and practice; --
   it is altogether inadequate in point of science." Regulative knowledge,
   therefore, is that which is designed to regulate our character and
   practice. It need not be true. Nay, it may be, and is demonstrably
   false, for Hamilton says it is blasphemy to think that God really is
   what we take Him to be.

   Objections to the Doctrine of Regulative Knowledge.

   1. The first remark on this doctrine of regulative knowledge is, that
   it is self-contradictory. Regulative truth is truth designed to
   accomplish a given end. Design, however, is the intelligent and
   voluntary adaptation of means to an end; and the intelligent adaptation
   of means to an end, is a personal act. Unless, therefore, God be really
   a person, there can be no such thing as regulative knowledge. Mr.
   Mansel says, we cannot know what God is in Himself, "but only how He
   wills that we should think of Him." Here "will" is attributed to God;
   and the personal pronouns are used, and must be used in the very
   statement of the doctrine. That is, we must assume that God is really
   (and not merely in our subjective apprehensions) a person, in order to
   believe in regulative knowledge, which form of knowledge supposes that
   He is not, or may not be a person. This is a contradiction.

   2. Regulative knowledge is, from the nature of the case, powerless,
   unless its subjects regard it as well founded. Some parents educate
   their children in the use of fictions and fairy tales; but belief in
   the truth of these is essential to their effect. So long as the world
   believed in ghosts and witches, the belief had power. As soon as men
   were satisfied that there were no such real existences, their power was
   gone. Had the philosophers convinced the Greeks that their gods were
   not real persons, there would have been an end to their mythology. And
   if Hamilton and his disciples can convince the world that the Infinite
   cannot be a person, the regulative influence of Theism is gone. Men
   cannot be influenced by representations which they know are not
   conformed to the truth.

   3. This theory is highly derogatory to God. It supposes Him to propose
   to influence his creatures by false representations; revealing Himself
   as Father, Governor, and Judge, when there is no objective truth to
   answer to these representations. And worse than this, as remarked
   above, it supposes Him to have so constituted our nature as to force us
   to believe what is not true. We are constrained by the laws of our
   rational and moral being to think of God as having a nature like our
   own, and yet we are told it is blasphemy so to regard Him. The theory
   supposes a conflict between reason and conscience, -- between our
   rational and moral nature. The latter forcing us to believe that God is
   a person, and the former declaring personality and deity to be
   contradictory ideas. We do not forget that Mr. Mansel says that the
   incogitable may be real, that the contradiction is in our own minds,
   and not necessarily in the nature of things. But this amounts to
   nothing; for he says continually that the Absolute cannot be a person,
   cannot be a cause, cannot be conscious, cannot either know or be known.
   He says, "A thing -- an object -- an attribute -- a person -- or any
   other term signifying one out of many possible objects of
   consciousness, is by that very relation necessarily declared to be
   finite." [360] That is, if God be a person, He is of necessity finite.
   Here the personality of God is said not only to be incogitable, or
   inconceivable, but impossible. And this is the real doctrine of his
   book. It must be so. It is intuitively true that the whole cannot be a
   part of itself; and if the Infinite be "the All," then it cannot be one
   out of many. If men adopt the principles of pantheists, they cannot
   consistently avoid their conclusions. Hamilton teaches not merely that
   God may not be what we think Him to be, but that He cannot so be; that
   we are ignorant what He is; that He is to us an unknown God. If God, by
   the laws of our reason, thus forces us to deny his personality, and by
   the laws of our moral nature makes it not only a duty, but a necessity
   to believe in his personality, then our nature is chaotic. Man, in that
   case, is not the noble creature that was formed in the image of God.

   4. This doctrine of regulative knowledge destroys the authority of the
   Scriptures. If all that the Bible teaches concerning the nature of God
   and concerning his relation to the world, reveals no objective truth,
   gives us no knowledge of what God really is, then what it teaches
   concerning the person, offices, and work of Christ, may all be unreal,
   and there may be no such person and no such Saviour.

   C. Objections to the whole Theory.

   1. The first and most obvious fallacy in the theory of Hamilton and
   Mansel, as it appears to us, lies in their definition of the Absolute
   and Infinite, or in the language of Hamilton, the Unconditioned. By the
   Absolute they mean that which exists in and of itself, and out of all
   relation. The Infinite is that, than which nothing greater can be
   conceived or is possible; which includes all actual and all possible
   modes of being. Mansel subscribes to the dictum of Hegel that the
   Absolute must include all modes of being, good as well as evil. In like
   manner the Infinite must be All. For if any other being exists, the
   Infinite must of necessity be limited, and, therefore, is no longer
   infinite.

   These definitions determine everything. If the Absolute be that which
   is incapable of all relation, then it must be alone; nothing but the
   Absolute can be actual or possible. Then it can neither know nor be
   known. And if the Infinite be all, then again there can be no finite.
   Then it is just as certain that the Absolute and Infinite cannot be
   cause, or conscious, or a person, as that a square cannot be a circle,
   or the whole a part of itself. When a definition leads to
   contradictions and absurdities, when it leads to conclusions which are
   inconsistent with the laws of our nature, and when it subverts all that
   consciousness, common sense, and the Bible declare to be true, the only
   rational inference is that the definition is wrong. This inference we
   have the right to draw in the present case. The very fact that the
   definitions of the Absolute and Infinite which Hamilton and Mansel have
   adopted from the transcendentalists, lead to all the fearful
   conclusions which they draw from them, is proof enough that they must
   be wrong. They are founded upon purely speculative à priori grounds.
   They can have no authority. For if, as these philosophers say, the
   Absolute and Infinite cannot be known, how can it be defined? Neither
   the etymology nor the usage of the words in question justifies the
   above given definitions of them. Absolute (ab and solvo) means, free,
   unrestrained, independent; as when we speak of an absolute monarch or
   absolute promise; or, unlimited, as when we speak of absolute space.
   The word is also used in the sense of finished, or perfect. An absolute
   being is one that is free, unlimited, independent, and perfect. God is
   absolute, because He is not dependent for His existence, nature,
   attributes, or acts, on any other being. He is unlimited, by anything
   out of Himself or independent of his will. But this does not imply that
   He is the only being; nor that in order to be absolute He must be dead,
   unconscious, or without thought or will. Much less does the word
   infinite, as applied to God, imply that He must include all forms of
   being. Space may be infinite without being duration, and duration may
   be infinite without being space. An infinite spirit does not include
   material forms of existence, any more than an infinite line is an
   infinite surface or an infinite solid. When it is said that anything is
   infinite, all that is properly meant is that no limit is assignable or
   possible to it as such. An infinite line is that to which no limit can
   be assigned as a line; infinite space is that to which no limit can be
   assigned as space; an infinite spirit is a spirit which is unlimited in
   all the attributes of a spirit. It is a great mistake to assume that
   the infinite must be all. Infinite power is not all power, but simply
   power to whose efficiency no limitation can be assigned; and infinite
   knowledge is not all knowledge, but simply knowledge to the extent of
   which no limit is possible. So too an infinite substance is not all
   substance, but a substance which is not excluded from any portion of
   space by other substances, or limited in the manifestation of any of
   its attributes or functions by anything out of itself. God, therefore,
   may be a Spirit infinite, eternal, and immutable in his being and
   perfections, without being matter, and sin, and misery.

   It may be said that as infinite space must include all space, so an
   infinite being must of necessity include all modes of being. This,
   however, is a mere play on words. Infinite is sometimes inclusive of
   all, not from the meaning of the word, but from the nature of the
   subject of which infinitude is predicated. Infinite space must include
   all space, because space is in its nature one. But an infinite line
   does not include all lines, because there may be any number of lines;
   and an infinite being is not all being, because there may be any number
   of beings.

   It must excite the wonder and indignation of ordinary men to see the
   fundamental truths of religion and morality endangered or subverted out
   of deference to the assumption that the Absolute must be unrelated.

   Wrong Definition of Knowledge.

   2. The second fallacy involved in Hamilton's theory concerns his idea
   of knowledge. When it is said that God is unknowable, everything
   depends on what is meant by knowledge. With him to know is to
   understand, to have a distinct conception, or mental image. This is
   evident from his using interchangeably the words unthinkable,
   unknowable, and inconceivable. Thus on a single page [361] Mansel uses
   the phrases that of which "we do not and cannot think," that "which we
   cannot conceive," and "that which we are unable to comprehend," as
   meaning one and the same thing. This is also proved from the manner in
   which other words and phrases are employed; for example, the Infinite,
   the Absolute, an absolute beginning, an absolute whole, an absolute
   part, any increase or diminution of the complement of being. The only
   sense, however, in which these things are unthinkable, is, that we
   cannot form a mental image of them. A distinguished German professor,
   when anything was said to which he could not assent, was accustomed to
   spread out his hands and close his eyes and say, "Ich kann gar keine
   Anschauung davon machen." I cannot see it with my minds eye, I cannot
   make an image of it. This seems to be a materialistic way of looking at
   things. The same may be said of cause, substance, and soul, of none of
   which can we frame a mental image; yet they are not unthinkable. A
   thing is unthinkable only when it is seen to be impossible, or when we
   can attach no meaning to the words, or proposition, in which it is
   stated. This impossibility of intelligent thought may arise from our
   weakness. The problems of the higher mathematics are unthinkable to a
   child. Or, the impossibility may arise from the nature of the thing
   itself. That a triangle should have four sides, or a circle be a
   square, is absolutely unthinkable. But in neither of these senses is
   the Infinite unthinkable. It is not impossible, for Hamilton and Mansel
   both admit that God is in fact infinite; nor is that proposition
   unintelligible. It conveys a perfectly clear and distinct idea to the
   mind. When the mind affirms to itself that space is infinite, i.e.,
   that it cannot be limited, it knows what it means just as well as when
   it says that two and two are four. Neither is an absolute beginning
   unthinkable. If, indeed, by absolute beginning is meant uncaused
   beginning, the coming into existence of something out of nothing, and
   produced by nothing, then it is impossible and therefore incogitable.
   But the dictum is applied to a creation ex nihilo, which is declared to
   be unthinkable. This, however, is denied. We will to move a limb, and
   it moves. God said, Let there be light, and light was. The one event is
   just as intelligible as the other. In neither case can we comprehend
   the nexus between the antecedent and the consequent, between the
   volition and the effect; but as facts they are equally thinkable and
   knowable.

   It is not possible to give the evidence scattered through the writings
   of Hamilton and Mansel, that they use the word "to know" in the sense
   of comprehending, or, forming a mental image of the object known.
   Mansel [362] quotes the following sentence from Dr. McCosh's work on
   the "Method of the Divine Government," namely, "The mind seeks in vain
   to embrace the infinite in a positive image, but is constrained to
   believe, when its efforts fail, that there is a something to which no
   limits can be put." This sentence Mansel says may be accepted "by the
   most uncompromising adherent" of Sir W. Hamilton's doctrine, that the
   infinite is unthinkable and unknowable. To know, therefore, according
   to Hamilton and Mansel, is to form a mental image of; and as we cannot
   form such an image of God, God cannot be known. Mansel is disposed to
   think that this reduces the controversy to a matter of words. And Dr.
   Tyler, in his able exposition of Hamilton's philosophy, says, [363] "So
   it be admitted, as it must, that all our intelligence of God is by
   analogy, it matters but little, practically, whether the conviction be
   called knowledge, belief, or faith." It is, however, very far from
   being a dispute about words. For Hamilton constantly asserts that God
   is not, and cannot be, what we think He is. Then we have no God. For
   what is God as infinite, if as Mansel says, "The Infinite, if it is to
   be conceived at all, must be conceived as potentially everything and
   actually nothing." [364]

   What is meant by Knowledge.

   Knowledge is the perception of truth. Whatever the mind perceives,
   whether intuitively or discursively, to be true, that it knows. We have
   immediate knowledge of all the facts of consciousness; and with regard
   to other matters, some we can demonstrate, some we can prove
   analogically, some we must admit or involve ourselves in contradictions
   and absurdities. Whatever process the mind may institute, if it arrives
   at a clear perception that a thing is, then that thing is an objects of
   knowledge. It is thus we know the object with which heaven and earth
   are crowded. It is thus we know our fellow men. With regard to anything
   without us, when our ideas, or convictions concerning it, correspond to
   what the thing really is, then we know it. How do we know that our
   nearest friend has a soul, and that that soul has intelligence, moral
   excellence, and power? We cannot see or feel it. We cannot form a
   mental image of it. It is mysterious and incomprehensible. Yet we know
   that it is, and what it is, just as certainly as we know that we
   ourselves are, and what we are. In the same way we know that God is,
   and what He is. We know that He is a spirit, that He has intelligence,
   moral excellence, and power to an infinite degree. We know that He can
   love, pity, and pardon; that He can hear and answer prayer. We know God
   in the same sense and just as certainly as we know our father or
   mother. And no man can take this knowledge from us, or persuade us that
   it is not knowledge, but a mere irrational belief.

   Hamilton's Doctrine Leads to Scepticism.

   3. The principles on which Hamilton and Mansel deny that God can be
   known, logically lead to scepticism. Hamilton has indeed rendered
   invaluable service to the cause of truth by his defence of what is,
   perhaps, infelicitously called the "Philosophy of Common Sense." The
   principles of that philosophy are: (1.) That what is given in
   consciousness is undoubtedly true. (2.) That whatever the laws of our
   nature force us to believe, must be accepted as true. (3.) That this
   principle applies to all the elements of our nature, to the senses, the
   reason, and the conscience. We cannot rationally or consistently with
   our allegiance to God, deny what our senses, reason, or conscience
   pronounce to be true. (4.) Neither the individual man, nor the cause of
   truth, however, is to be left to the mercy of what any one may choose
   to say reason or conscience teaches. Nothing is to be accepted as the
   authoritative judgment of either reason or conscience, which does not
   bear the criteria of universality and necessity.

   Hamilton has drawn from the stores of his erudition, in this department
   perhaps unexampled, proof that these principles have been recognized by
   the leading philosophic minds in all ages. He himself sustains them
   with earnestness as the safeguards of truth. He impressively asserts
   that if consciousness once be convicted of falsehood, all is lost; we
   have then no resting place for either science or religion; that
   absolute scepticism follows, if it be denied that necessity and
   universality of belief are not decisive proof of the truth of what is
   thus believed. Even Stuart Mill admits that "whatever is known to us by
   consciousness, is known beyond possibility of question." [365] Mr.
   Mansel tells us that it is from consciousness we get our idea of
   substance, of personality, of cause, of right and wrong, in short of
   everything which lies at the foundation of knowledge and religion; and
   therefore if consciousness deceive us we have nothing to depend upon.
   Mansel thus expounds the famous aphorism of Des Cartes, "Cogito ergo
   sum," i.e., "I, who see, and hear, and think, and feel, am the one
   continuous self, whose existence gives unity and connection to the
   whole. Personality comprises all that we know of that which exists;
   relation to personality comprises all that we know of that which seems
   to exist." [366] "Consciousness," he says, "gives us the knowledge of
   substance. We are a substantive existence." [367] "I exist as I am
   conscious of existing; and conscious self is itself the Ding an sich,
   the standard by which all representations of personality must be
   judged, and from which our notion of reality, as distinguished from
   appearance, is originally derived." [368] Hamilton and Mansel therefore
   teach that the veracity of consciousness is the foundation of all
   knowledge, and that the denial of that veracity inevitably leads to
   absolute scepticism. Nevertheless they teach that our senses deceive
   us; that reason deceives us; that conscience deceives us; that is, that
   our sensuous, rational, and moral consciousness are alike deceptive and
   unreliable.

   Our senses give us the knowledge of the external world. They teach us
   that things are, and what they are. It is admitted that the universal
   and irresistible belief of men, as that belief is determined by their
   sense and consciousness, is that things really are what to our senses
   they appear to be. Philosophers tell us this is a delusion. Kant says
   that they certainly are not what we take them to be. Mansel says this
   is going rather too far. We cannot know, indeed, what they are, but it
   is possible that they are in fact what they appear to be. In either
   case they are to us all unknown quantity, and the senses deceive us.
   They assume to teach more than they have a right to teach, and we are
   bound to believe them.

   Kant teaches that our reason, that the necessary laws of thought which
   govern our mental operations, lead to absolute contradictions. In this
   Hamilton and Mansel fully agree with him. They tell us that reason
   teaches that the Absolute must be all things actual and possible; that
   there cannot be an absolute or infinite person, or cause; that being
   and not-being are identical; that the infinite is "potentially all
   things and actually nothing." These and similar contradictions are said
   to be inevitable results of all attempts to know God as an Absolute and
   Infinite Being. "The conception of the Absolute and Infinite, from
   whatever side we view it, appears encompassed with contradictions.
   There is a contradiction in supposing such an object to exist, whether
   alone or in conjunction with others; and there is a contradiction in
   supposing it not to exist. There is a contradiction in conceiving it as
   one, and there is a contradiction in conceiving it as many. There is a
   contradiction in conceiving it as personal; and there is a
   contradiction in conceiving it as impersonal. It cannot without
   contradiction be represented as active; nor, without equal
   contradiction, be represented as inactive. It cannot be conceived as
   the sum of all existence; nor yet can it be conceived of as a part only
   of that sum." [369] Yet all this we are called upon to believe; for it
   is our duty, he says, to believe that God is infinite and absolute.
   That is, we are bound to believe what our rational consciousness
   pronounces to be contradictory and impossible.

   Conscience, or our moral consciousness, is no less deceptive. Mr.
   Mansel admits that we are conscious of dependence and of moral
   obligation; that this involves what he calls "the consciousness of
   God," i.e., that we stand in the relation to God of one spirit to
   another spirit, of one person to another person; a person so superior
   to us as to have rightfully supreme authority over us, and who has all
   the power and all the moral perfections which enter into our idea of
   God. But all this is a delusion. It is a delusion, because what our
   moral consciousness thus teaches involves all the contradictions and
   absurdities above mentioned; because it is said to teach not what God
   is, but only what it is desirable that we should think He is; and
   because we are told that it is blasphemy to think that He is what we
   take Him to be.

   The theory, therefore, of Hamilton and Mansel as to the knowledge of
   God is suicidal. It is inconsistent with the veracity of consciousness,
   which is the fundamental principle of their philosophy. The theory is
   an incongruous combination of sceptical principles with orthodox faith,
   the anti-theistic principles of Kant with Theism. One or the other must
   be given up. We cannot believe in a personal God, if an infinite person
   be a contradiction and absurdity.

   God has not so constituted our nature as to make it of necessity
   deceptive. The senses, reason, and conscience, within their appropriate
   spheres, and in their normal exercise, are trustworthy guides. They
   teach us real, and not merely apparent or regulative truth. Their
   combined spheres comprehend all the relations in which we, as rational
   creatures, stand to the external world, to our fellow-men, and to God.
   Were it not for the disturbing element of sin, we know not that man, in
   full communion with his Maker, whose Favour is light and life, would
   have needed any other guides. But man is not in his original and normal
   state. In apostatizing from God, man fell into a state of darkness and
   confusion. Reason and conscience are no longer adequate guides as to
   "the things of God." Of fallen men, the Apostle says: "That when they
   knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but
   became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was
   darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools; and
   changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to
   corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping
   things" (Rom. i. 21-23); or, worse yet, into an absolute and infinite
   being, without consciousness, intelligence, or moral character; a being
   which is not potentially all things, and actually nothing. It is true,
   therefore, as the same. Apostle tells us, that the world by wisdom
   knows not God. It is true in a still higher sense, as the Lord himself
   says, that no man "knoweth the Father, save the Son, and he to
   whomsoever the Son will reveal Him." (Matt. xi. 27.)

   Necessity of a Supernatural Revelation.

   We need, therefore, a divine supernatural revelation. Of this
   revelation, it is to be remarked, first, that it gives us real
   knowledge. It teaches us what God really is; what sin is; what the law
   is; what Christ and the plan of salvation through Him are; and what is
   to be the state of the soul after death. The knowledge thus
   communicated is real, in the sense that the ideas which we are thus led
   to form of the things revealed conform to what those things really are.
   God and Christ, holiness and sin, heaven and hell, really are what the
   Bible declares them to be. Sir William Hamilton [370] divides the
   objects of knowledge into two classes: those derived from within, from
   the intelligence; and those derived from experience. The latter are of
   two kinds: what we know from our own experience, and what we know from
   the experience of others, authenticated to us by adequate testimony. In
   the generally received sense of the word this is true knowledge. No man
   hesitates to say that he knows that there was such a man as Washington,
   or such an event as the American Revolution. If the testimony of men
   can give us clear and certain knowledge of facts beyond our experience,
   surely the testimony of God is greater. What He reveals is made known.
   We apprehend it as it truly is. The conviction that what God reveals is
   made known in its true nature, is the very essence of faith in the
   divine testimony. We are certain, therefore, that our ideas of God,
   founded on the testimony of his Word, correspond to what He really is,
   and constitute true knowledge. It is also to be remembered that while
   the testimony of men is to the mind, the testimony of God is not only
   to, but also within the mind. It illuminates and informs; so that the
   testimony of God is called the demonstration of the Spirit.

   The second remark concerning the revelation contained in the Scriptures
   is, that while it makes known truths far above the reach of sense or
   reason, it reveals nothing which contradicts either. It harmonizes with
   our whole nature. It supplements all our other knowledge, and
   authenticates itself by harmonizing the testimony of enlightened
   consciousness with the testimony of God in his Word.

   The conclusion, therefore, of the whole matter is, that we know God in
   the same sense in which we know ourselves and things out of ourselves.
   We have the same conviction that God is, and that He is, in Himself,
   and independently of our thought of Him, what we take Him to be. Our
   subjective idea corresponds to the objective reality. This knowledge of
   God is the foundation of all religion; and therefore to deny that God
   can be known, is really to deny that rational religion is possible. In
   other words, it makes religion a mere sentiment, or blind feeling,
   instead of its being what the Apostle declares it to be, a logike
   latreia, a rational service; the homage of the reason as well as of the
   heart and life. "Our knowledge of God," says Hase, "developed and
   enlightened by the Scriptures, answers to what God really is, for He
   cannot deceive us as to his own nature." [371]

CHAPTER V.

  NATURE AND ATTRIBUTES OF GOD
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Definitions of God.

   THE question whether God can be defined, depends for its answer on what
   is meant by definition. Cicero [372] says, "Est definitio, earum rerum,
   quæ sunt ejus rei propriæ, quam definire volumus, brevis et
   circumscripta quædam explicatio." In this sense God cannot be defined.
   No creature, much less man, can know all that is proper to God; and,
   therefore, no creature can give an exhaustive statement of all that God
   is.

   To define, however, is simply to bound, to separate, or distinguish; so
   that the thing defined may be discriminated from all other things. This
   may be done (1.) By stating its characteristics. (2.) By stating its
   genus and its specific difference. (3.) By analyzing the idea as it
   lies in our minds. (4.) By an explanation of the term or name by which
   it is denoted. All these methods amount to much the same thing. When we
   say we can define God, all that is meant is, that we can analyze the
   idea of God as it lies in our mind; or, that we can state the class of
   beings to which He belongs, and the attributes by which He is
   distinguished from all other beings. Thus, in the simple definition,
   God is ens perfectissimum, the word ens designates Him as a being, not
   an idea, but as that which has real, objective existence; and absolute
   perfection distinguishes Him from all other beings. The objection to
   this and most other definitions of God is, that they do not bring out
   with sufficient fulness the contents of the idea. This objection bears
   against such definitions as the following: Ens absolutum, the
   self-existent, independent being; and that by Calovius, "Deus est
   essentia spiritualis infinita;" and Reinhard's [373] "Deus est, Natura
   necessaria, a mundo diversa, summas complexa perfectiones et ipsius
   mundi causa;" or Baumgarten's "Spiritus perfectissimus, rationem qui
   ipsius rerumque contingentium omnium seu mundi continens;" or, that of
   Morus, "Spiritus perfectissimus, conditor, conservator, et gubernator
   mundi." Probably the best definition of God ever penned by man, is that
   given in the "Westminster Catechism": "God is a Spirit, infinite,
   eternal, and unchangeable, in his being, wisdom, power, holiness,
   justice, goodness, and truth." This is a true definition; for it states
   the class of beings to which God is to be referred. He is a Spirit; and
   He is distinguished from all other spirits in that He is infinite,
   eternal, and unchangeable in his being and perfections. It is also a
   complete definition, in so far as it is an exhaustive statement of the
   contents of our idea of God.

   In what sense, however, are these terms used? What is meant by the
   words "being," and "perfections," or "attributes" of God? In what
   relation do his attributes stand to his essence and to each other?
   These are questions on which theologians, especially during the
   scholastic period, expended much time and labor.

   Being of God.

   By being is here meant that which has a real, substantive existence. It
   is equivalent to substance, or essence. It is opposed to what is merely
   thought, and to a mere force or power. We get this idea, in the first
   place, from consciousness. We are conscious of self as the subject of
   the thoughts, feelings, and volitions, which are its varying states and
   acts. This consciousness of substance is involved in that of personal
   identity. In the second place, a law of our reason constrains us to
   believe that there is something which underlies the phenomena of matter
   and mind, of which those phenomena are the manifestation. It is
   impossible for us to think of thought and feeling, unless there be
   something that thinks and feels. It is no less impossible to think of
   action, unless there be something that acts; or of motion, unless there
   be something that moves. To assume, therefore, that mind is only a
   series of acts and states, and that matter is nothing but force, is to
   assume that nothing (nonentity) can produce effects.

   God, therefore, is in his nature a substance, or essence, which is
   infinite, eternal, and unchangeable; the common subject of all divine
   perfections, and the common agent of all divine acts. This is as far as
   we can go, or need to go. We have no definite idea of substance,
   whether of matter or mind, as distinct from its attributes. The two are
   inseparable. In knowing the one we know the other. We cannot know
   hardness except as we know something hard. We have, therefore, the same
   knowledge of the essence of God, as we have of the substance of the
   soul. All we have to do in reference to the divine essence, as a
   Spirit, is to deny of it, as we do of our own spiritual essence, what
   belongs to material substances; and to affirm of it, that in itself and
   its attributes it is infinite, eternal, and unchangeable. When,
   therefore, we say there is a God, we do not assert merely that there is
   in our minds the idea of an infinite Spirit; but that, entirely
   independent of our idea of Him, such a Being really exists. Augustine
   [374] says, "Deus est quædam substantia; nam quod nulla substantia est,
   nihil omnino est. Substantia ergo aliquid esse est."

   If, therefore, a divine essence, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable,
   exists, this essence existed before and independent of the world. It
   follows also that the essence of God is distinct from the world The
   Scriptural doctrine of God is consequently opposed to the several forms
   of error already mentioned; to Hylozoism, which assumes that God, like
   man, is a composite being, the world being to Him what the body is to
   us; to Materialism, which denies the existence of any spiritual
   substance, and affirms that the material alone is real; to extreme
   Idealism, which denies not only the reality of the internal world, but
   all real objective existence, and affirms that the subjective alone is
   real; to Pantheism, which either makes the world the existence form of
   God, or, denying the reality of the world, makes God the only real
   existence. That is, it either makes nature God, or, denying nature,
   makes God everything.

   § 2. Divine Attributes.

   To the divine essence, which in itself is infinite, eternal, and
   unchangeable, belong certain perfections revealed to us in the
   constitution of our nature and in the word of God. These divine
   perfections are called attributes as essential to the nature of a
   divine Being, and necessarily involved in our idea of God. The older
   theologians distinguished the attributes of God, (1.) From predicates
   which refer to God in the concrete, and indicate his relation to his
   creatures, as creator, preserver, ruler, etc. (2.) From properties,
   which are technically the distinguishing characteristics of the several
   persons of the Trinity. There are certain acts or relations peculiar or
   proper to the Father, others to the Son, and others to the Spirit. And
   (3.) From accidents or qualities which may or may not belong to a
   substance, which may be acquired or lost. Thus holiness was not an
   attribute of the nature of Adam, but an accident, something which he
   might lose and still remain a man; whereas intelligence was an
   attribute, because the loss of intelligence involves the loss of
   humanity. The perfections of God, therefore, are attributes, without
   which He would cease to be God.

   Relation of the Attributes to the Essence of God.

   In attempting to explain the relation in which the attributes of God
   stand to his essence and to each other, there are two extremes to be
   avoided. First, we must not represent God as a composite being,
   composed of different elements; and, secondly, we must not confound the
   attributes, making them all mean the same thing, which is equivalent to
   denying them all together. The Realists of the Middle Ages tended to
   the former of these extremes, and the Nominalists to the other.
   Realists held that general terms express not merely thoughts, or
   abstract conceptions in our minds, but real or substantive, objective
   existence. And hence they were disposed to represent the divine
   attributes as differing from each other realiter, as one res or thing
   differs from another. The Nominalists, on the other hand, said general
   terms are mere words answering to abstractions formed by the mind. And
   consequently when we speak of different attributes in God, we only use
   different words for one and the same thing. Occam, Biel, and other
   Nominalists, therefore, taught that "Attributa divina nec rei, nec
   rationis distinctione, inter se aut ab essentia divina distingui; sed
   omnem distinctionem esse solum in nominibus." The Lutheran and Reformed
   theologians tended much more to the latter of these extremes than to
   the former. They generally taught, in the first place, that the unity
   and simplicity of the divine essence precludes not only all physical
   composition of constituent elements, or of matter and form, or of
   subject and accidents; but also all metaphysical distinction as of act
   and power, essence and existence, nature and personality; and even of
   logical difference, as genus and specific difference.

   In the second place, the theologians were accustomed to say that the
   attributes of God differ from his essence non re, sed ratione. This is
   explained by saying that things differ ex natura rei, when they are
   essentially different as soul and body; while a difference ex ratione
   is merely a difference in us, i.e., in our conceptions, i.e., "quod
   distincte solum concipitur, cum in re ipsa distinctum non sit." Hence
   the divine attributes are defined as "conceptus essentiæ divinæ
   inadequatæ, ex parte rei ipsam essentiam involventes, eandemque
   intrinsice denominantes." Aquinas says, "Deus est unus re et plures
   ratione, quia intellectus noster ita multipliciter apprehendit Deum,
   sicuti res multipliciter ipsum representant." The language of the
   Lutheran theologian Quenstedt [375] exhibits the usual mode of
   representing this subject: "Si proprie et accurate loqui velimus, Deus
   nullas habet proprietates, sed mera et simplicissima est essentia quæ
   nec realem differentiam nec ullam vel rerum vel modorum admittit
   compositionem. Quia vero simplicissimam Dei essentiam uno adequato
   conceptu adequate concipere non possumus, ideo inadequatis et
   distinctis conceptibus, inadequate essentiam divinam repræsentantibus,
   eam apprehendimus, quos inadequatos conceptus, qui a parte rei essentiæ
   divinæ identificantur, et a nobis per modum affectionum apprehenduntur,
   attributa vocamus." And again, "Attributa divina a parte rei et in se
   non multa sunt, sed ut ipsa essentia divina, ita et attributa, quæ cum
   illa identificantur, simplicissima unitas sunt; multa vero dicuntur
   (1.) sunkatabatikos, ad nostrum concipiendi modum, . . . . (2.)
   energetikos, in ordine ad effecta." [376] The favorite illustration to
   explain what was meant by this unity of the divine attributes, was
   drawn from the sun. His ray, by one and the same power (as was then
   assumed) illuminates, warms, and produces chemical changes, not from
   any diversity in it, but from diversity in the nature of the objects on
   which it operates. The force is the same; the effects are different.
   The meaning of these theologians is further determined by their denying
   that the relation of attribute and essence in God is analogous to the
   relation of intelligence and will to the essence of the soul in man;
   and also by the frequently recurring declaration, borrowed from the
   schoolmen, that God is actus purus. Schleiermacher goes still further
   in the same direction. With him the divine attributes are mere
   Beziehungen, or relations of God to us. He commonly resolves them into
   mere causality. Thus he defines the holiness of God to be that
   causality in Him which produces conscience in us.

   Divine Attributes.

   A third and less objectionable way of representing the matter is
   adopted by those who say with Hollazius: "Attributa divina ab essentia
   divina et a se invicem, distinguuntur non nominaliter neque realiter
   sed formaliter, secundum nostrum concipiendi modum, non sine certo
   distinctionis fundamento." [377] This is very different from saying
   that they differ ratione tantum. Turrettin says the attributes are to
   be distinguished not realiter, but virtualiter; that is, there is a
   real foundation in the divine nature for the several attributes
   ascribed to Him.

   It is evident that this question of the relation of the divine
   attributes to the divine essence merges itself into the general
   question of the relation between attributes and substance. It is also
   evident that this is a subject about which one man knows just as much
   as another; because all that can be known about it is given immediately
   in consciousness.

   This subject has already been referred to. We are conscious of
   ourselves as a thinking substance. That is, we are conscious that that
   which is ourselves has identity, continuance, and power. We are further
   conscious that the substance self thinks, wills, and feels.
   Intelligence, will, and sensibility, are its functions, or attributes,
   and consequently the attributes of a spirit. These are the ways in
   which a spirit acts. Anything which does not thus act, which has not
   these functions or attributes, is not a spirit. If you take from a
   spirit its intelligence, will, and sensibility, nothing remains its,
   substance is gone; at least it ceases to be a spirit. Substance and
   attributes are inseparable. The one is known in the other. A substance
   without attributes is nothing, i.e., no real existence. What is true of
   spiritual substances is true of matter. Matter, without the essential
   properties of matter, is a contradiction.

   We know, therefore, from consciousness, as far as it can be known, the
   relation between substance and its attributes. And all that can be
   done, or need be done, is to deny or correct the false representations
   which are so often made on the subject.

   The Divine Attributes do not differ merely in our Conception.

   To say, as the schoolmen, and so many even of Protestant theologians,
   ancient and modern, were accustomed to say, that the divine attributes
   differ only in name, or in our conceptions, or in their effects, is to
   destroy all true knowledge of God. Thus even Augustine confounds
   knowledge and power, when he says, [378] "Nos ista, quæ fecisti videmus
   quia sunt: tu autem quia vides ea, sunt." So Scotus Erigena [379] says,
   "Non aliud est ei videre, aliud facere; sed visio illius voluntas ejus
   est, et voluntas operatio." Thomas Aquinas [380] says the same thing:
   "Deus per intellectum suum causat res, cum suum esse sit suum
   intelligere." And again, "Scientia (Dei) causat res; nostra vero
   causatur rebus et dependat ab eis." Even Mr. Mansel, [381] to aggravate
   our ignorance of God, speaks of Him as "an intellect whose thought
   creates its own object." It is obvious that, according to this view,
   God is simply a force of which we know nothing but its effects. If in
   God eternity is identical with knowledge, knowledge with power, power
   with ubiquity, and ubiquity with holiness, we are using words without
   meaning when we attribute any perfection to God. We must, therefore,
   either give up the attempt to determine the divine attributes from our
   speculative idea of an infinite essence, or renounce all knowledge of
   God, and all faith in the revelation of Himself, which He has made in
   the constitution of our nature, in the external world, and in his Word.
   Knowledge is no more identical with power in God than it is in us.
   Thought in Him is no more creative than is thought in us. Otherwise
   creation is eternal, and God creates everything -- all the thoughts,
   feelings, and volitions of his creatures, good and evil; and God is the
   only real agent, and the only real being in the universe. According to
   this doctrine, also, there can be no difference between the actual and
   the possible, for the one as well as the other is always present to the
   divine mind. It would also follow that the creation must be infinite,
   or God finite. For if knowledge is causative, God creates all He knows,
   and you must limit his knowledge if you limit creation. It need hardly
   be remarked that this doctrine is derogatory to God. It is not only a
   much higher idea, but one essential to personality, that there should
   be a real distinction between the divine attributes. That which from
   its nature and by necessity does all that it can do, is a force, and
   not a person. It can have no will. The doctrine in question, therefore,
   is essentially pantheistic. "However much," says Martensen, "we must
   guard our idea of God from being degraded by anything that is merely
   human, from all false Anthropomorphism, yet we can find in Nominalism
   only the denial of God as He is revealed in the Scriptures. It is the
   denial of the very essence of faith, if it is only in our thoughts that
   God is holy and righteous, and not in his own nature; if it is we who
   so address Him, and not He who so reveals Himself. We teach, therefore,
   with the Realists (of one class), that the attributes of God are
   objectrvely true as revealed, and therefore have their ground in the
   divine essence." There is a kind of Realism, as Martensen admits, which
   is as destructive of the true idea of God as the Nominalism which makes
   his attributes differ only in name. It grants, indeed, objective
   reality to our ideas; but these ideas, according to it, have no real
   subject. "The idea of omnipotence, righteousness, and holiness," he
   says, "is a mere blind thought, if there be not an omnipotent,
   righteous, and holy One." [382]

   The Divine Attributes not to be resolved into Causality.

   It amounts to much the same doctrine, to resolve all the attributes of
   God into causality. It was a principle with some of the schoolmen,
   "Affectus in Deo denotat effectum." This was so applied as to limit our
   knowledge of God to the fact that God is the cause of certain effects.
   Thus, when we say God is just, we mean nothing more than that He causes
   misery to follow sin; when we say He is holy, it only means that He is
   the cause of conscience in us. As a tree is not sweet, because its
   fruit is luscious, so God is not holy, he is only the cause of
   holiness. Against this application of the principle, Aquinas himself
   protested, declaring, "Cum igitur dicitur, Deus est bonus; non est
   sensus, Deus est causa bonitatis; vel Deus non est malus. Sed est
   sensus: Id, quod bonitatem dicimus in creaturis, præexistit in Deo; et
   hoc quidem secundum modum altiorem. Unde ex hoc non sequitur, quod Deo
   competat esse bonum, in quantum causat bonitatem; sed potius e
   converso, quia est bonus, bonitatem rebus diffundit." [383] And the
   Lutheran theologian, Quenstedt, says, "Dicunt nonnulli, ideo Deum dici
   justum, sanctum, misericordem, veracem, etc., non quod revera sit
   talis, sed quod duntaxat sanctitatis, justitiæ, misericordiæ,
   veritatis, etc., causa sit et auctor in aliis. Sed si Deus non est vere
   misericors, neque vere perfectus, vere sanctus, etc., sed causa tantum
   misericordiæ et sanctitatis in aliis, ita etiam et nos pariter
   juberemur esse non vere misericordes, non vere perfecti, etc., sed
   sanctitatis saltem et misericordiæ in aliis auctores." [384]

   The Divine Attributes differ Virtualiter.

   Theologians, to avoid the blank ignorance of God which must follow from
   the extreme view of the simplicity of his essence, which requires us to
   assume that the divine attributes differ only in our conceptions, or as
   expressing the diverse effects of the activity of God, made a
   distinction between the ratio rationantis and the ratio rationatæ. That
   is, the reason as determining, and the reason as determined. The
   attributes, they say, differ not re, but ratione; not in our subjective
   reason only; but there is in God a reason why we think of Him as
   possessing these diverse perfections. This idea, as before stated, was
   often expressed by saying that the divine attributes differ neither
   realiter, nor nominaliter, but virtualiter. If this be understood to
   mean that the divine perfections are really what the Bible declares
   them to be; that God truly thinks, feels, and acts; that He is truly
   wise, just, and good, that He is truly omnipotent, and voluntary,
   acting or not acting, as He sees fit; that He can hear and answer
   prayer; it may be admitted. But we are not to give up the conviction
   that God is really in Himself what He reveals Himself to be, to satisfy
   any metaphysical speculations as to the difference between essence and
   attribute in an infinite Being. The attributes of God, therefore, are
   not merely different conceptions in our minds, but different modes in
   which God reveals Himself to his creatures (or to Himself); just as our
   several faculties are different modes in which the inscrutable
   substance self reveals itself in our consciousness and acts. It is an
   old saying, "Qualis homo, talis Deus." And Clemens Alexandrinus [385]
   says, "If any one knows himself, he will know God." And Leibnitz
   expresses the same great truth when he says, [386] "The perfections of
   God are those of our own souls, but He possesses them without limit. He
   is an ocean of which we have only received a few drops. There is in us
   something of power, something of knowledge, something of goodness; but
   these attributes are in entireness in Him." There is indeed danger in
   either extreme, danger of degrading God in our thoughts, by reducing
   Him to the standard of our nature, and danger of denying Him as He is
   revealed. In our day, and among educated men, and especially among
   students of philosophy, the latter danger is by far the greater of the
   two. We should remember that we lose God, when we lose our confidence
   in saying Thou! to Him, with the assurance of being heard and helped.

   § 3. Classification of the Divine Attributes.

   On few subjects have greater thought and labor been expended than on
   this. Perhaps, however, the benefit has not been commensurate with the
   labor. The object of classification is order, and the object of order
   is clearness. So far as this end is secured, it is a good. But the
   great diversity of the methods which have been proposed, is evidence
   that no one method of arrangement has such advantages as to secure for
   it general recognition.

   1. Some, as has been seen, preclude all necessity of a classification
   of the attributes, by reducing them all to unity, or regarding them as
   different phases under which we contemplate the Supreme Being as the
   ground of all things. With them the whole discussion of the divine
   attributes is an analysis of the idea of the Infinite and Absolute.

   2. Others arrange the attributes according to the mode in which we
   arrive at the knowledge of them. We form our idea of God, it is said,
   (1.) By the way of causation; that is, by referring to Him as the great
   first cause every virtue manifested by the effects which He produces.
   (2.) By the way of negation; that is, by denying to Him the limitations
   and imperfections which belong to his creatures. (3.) By the way of
   eminence, in exalting to an infinite degree or without limit the
   perfections which belong to an infinite Being. If this is so, the
   attributes conceived of by one of these methods belong to one class,
   and those conceived of, or of which we attain the knowledge by another
   method, belong to another class. This principle of classification is
   perhaps the one most generally adopted. It gives rise, however, really
   but to two classes, namely, the positive and negative, i.e., those in
   which something is affirmed, and those in which something is denied
   concerning God. To the negative class are commonly referred simplicity,
   infinity, eternity, immutability; to the positive class, power,
   knowledge, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth. Instead of calling
   the one class negative and the other positive, they are often
   distinguished as absolute and relative. By an absolute attribute is
   meant one which belongs to God, considered in Himself, and which
   implies no relation to other beings; by a relative attribute is meant
   one which implies relation to an object. They are also distinguished as
   immanent and transient, as communicable and incommunicable. These terms
   are used interchangeably. They do not express different modes of
   classification, but are different modes of designating the same
   classification. Negative, absolute, immanent, and incommunicable, are
   designations of one class; and positive, relative, transitive, and
   communicable, are designations of the other class.

   3. A third principle of classification is derived from the constitution
   of our own nature. In man there is the substance or essence of the
   soul, the intellect, and the will. Hence, it is said, we can most
   naturally arrange the attributes of God under three heads. First, those
   pertaining to his essence; second, those referring to his intellect;
   and third, those referring to his will, the word "will" being taken in
   its most comprehensive sense.

   4. Others again seek the principle of classification in the nature of
   the attributes themselves. Some include the idea of moral excellence,
   and others do not. Hence they are distinguished as natural and moral.
   The word natural, however, is ambiguous. Taking it in the sense of what
   constitutes or pertains to the nature, the holiness and justice of God
   are as much natural as his power or knowledge. And on the other hand,
   God is infinite and eternal in his moral perfections, although infinity
   and eternity are not distinctively moral perfections. In the common and
   familiar sense of the word natural, the terms natural and moral express
   a real distinction.

   5. Schleiermacher's method is, of course, peculiar. It is based on the
   characteristic principle of his system, that all religion is founded on
   a sense of dependence, and all theology consists in what that sense of
   dependence teaches us. He does not treat of the divine attributes in
   any one place, but here and there, as they come up according to his
   plan. Our sense of dependence does not awaken in our consciousness a
   feeling of opposition to God's eternity, omnipotence, omnipresence, or
   omniscience. These, therefore, are treated of in one place. But we, as
   dependent creatures, are conscious of opposition to God's holiness and
   righteousness. These, therefore, belong to another head. And as this
   opposition is removed through Christ, we are brought into relation to
   God's grace or love, and to his wisdom. These form a third class.

   That so many different principles of classification have been adopted,
   and that each of those principles is carried out in so many different
   ways, shows the uncertainty and difficulty attending the whole subject.
   It is proposed in what follows to accept the guidance of the answer
   given in the "Westminster Catechism," to the question, What is God? It
   is assumed in that answer that God is a self-existent and necessary
   Being; and it is affirmed of Him, I. That He is a Spirit. II. That as
   such He is infinite, eternal, and immutable. III. That He is infinite,
   eternal, and immutable, (1.) In his being. (2.) In all that belongs to
   his intelligence, namely, in his knowledge and wisdom. (3.) In all that
   belongs to his will, namely, his power, holiness, justice, goodness,
   and truth. Whatever speculative objections may be made to this plan, it
   has the advantage of being simple and familiar.

   § 4. Spirituality of God.

   A. The Meaning of the Word "Spirit."

   The fundamental principle of interpretation of all writings, sacred or
   profane, is that words are to be understood in their historical sense;
   that is, in the sense in which it can be historically proved that they
   were used by their authors and intended to be understood by those to
   whom they were addressed. The object of language is the communication
   of thought. Unless words are taken in the sense in which those who
   employ them know they will be understood, they fail of their design.
   The sacred writings being the words of God to man, we are bound to take
   them in the sense in which those to whom they were originally addressed
   must inevitably have taken them. What is the meaning of the word
   "spirit?" or rather, What is the usus loquendi of the Hebrew and Greek
   words to which our word "spirit" corresponds? In answering this
   question, we learn what our Lord meant when he said God is a Spirit.
   Originally the words rvch and pneuma meant the moving air, especially
   the breath, as in the phrase pneuma biou; then any invisible power;
   then the human soul. In saying, therefore, that God is a Spirit, our
   Lord authorizes us to believe that whatever is essential to the idea of
   a spirit, as learned from our own consciousness, is to be referred to
   God as determining his nature. On this subject consciousness teaches,
   and has taught all men, --

   1. That the soul is a substance; that our thoughts and feelings have a
   common ground, of which they are the varying states or acts. Substance
   is that which has an objective existence, and has permanence and power.
   Even Kant says: "Wo Handlung, mithin Thätigkeit und Kraft ist, da ist
   auch Substanz," where operation, and consequently activity and power
   are, there is substance. [387] This is not only the common conviction
   of men, but it is admitted by the vast majority of philosophers. As
   before remarked, that there should be action without something acting,
   is as unthinkable as that there should be motion without something
   moving.

   2. Consciousness teaches that the soul is an individual subsistence.
   This is included in the consciousness of the unity, identity, and
   permanence of the soul. It is not that we are conscious simply of
   certain states of the soul, from which we infer its substance and
   subsistence; but that such are the contents of the knowledge given to
   us in the consciousness of self. Des Cartes famous aphorism, Cogito
   ergo sum, is not a syllogism. It does not mean that existence is
   inferred from the consciousness of thought; but that the consciousness
   of thought involves the consciousness of existence. Des Cartes himself
   so understood the matter, for he says: "Cum advertimus nos esse res
   cogitantes, prima quædam notio est quæ ex nullo syllogismo concluditur;
   neque etiam cum quis dicit Ego cogito, ergo sum, sive existo,'
   existentiam ex cogitatione per syllogismum deducit, sed tanquam rem per
   se notam simplici mentis intuitu agnoscit." [388] Mansel says:
   "Whatever may be the variety of the phenomena of consciousness,
   sensations by this or that organ, volitions, thoughts, imaginations, of
   all we are immediately conscious as affections of one and the same
   self. It is not by any after-effort of reflection that I combine
   together sight and hearing, thought and volition, into a factitious
   unity or compounded whole, in each case I am immediately conscious of
   myself seeing and hearing, willing and thinking. This self-personality,
   like all other simple and immediate presentations, is indefinable, but
   it is so because it is superior to definition." [389] This individual
   subsistence is thus involved in the consciousness of self, because in
   self-consciousness we distinguish ourselves from all that is not
   ourselves.

   3. As power of some kind belongs to every substance, the power which
   belongs to spirit, to the substance self, is that of thought, feeling,
   and volition. All this is given in the simplest form of consciousness.
   We are not more certain that we exist, than that we think, feel, and
   will. We know ourselves only as thus thinking, feeling, and willing,
   and we therefore are sure that these powers or faculties are the
   essential attributes of a spirit, and must belong to every spirit.

   4. Consciousness also informs us of the unity or simplicity of the
   soul. It is not compounded of different elements. It is composed of
   substance and form. It is a simple substance endowed with certain
   attributes. It is incapable of separation or division.

   5. In being conscious of our individual subsistence, we are conscious
   of personality. Every individual subsistence is not a person. But every
   individual subsistence which thinks and feels, and has the power of
   self-determination, is a person; and, therefore, the consciousness of
   our subsistence, and of the powers of thought and volition, is the
   consciousness of personality.

   6. We are also conscious of being moral agents, susceptible of moral
   character, and the subjects of moral obligation.

   7. It need not be added that every spirit must possess
   self-consciousness. This is involved in all that has been said. Without
   self-consciousness we should be a mere power in nature. This is the
   very ground of our being, and is necessarily involved in the idea of
   self as a real existence.

   It is impossible, therefore, to overestimate the importance of the
   truth contained in the simple proposition, God is a Spirit. It is
   involved in that proposition that God is immaterial. None of the
   properties of matter can be predicated of Him. He is not extended or
   divisible, or compounded, or visible, or tangible. He has neither bulk
   nor form. The Bible everywhere recognizes as true the intuitive
   convictions of men. One of those convictions is that spirit is not
   matter, or matter spirit; that different and incompatible attributes
   cannot belong to the same substance. In revealing, therefore, to us
   that God is a Spirit, it reveals to us that no attribute of matter can
   be predicated of the divine essence. The realistic dualism which lies
   at the bottom of all human convictions, underlies also all the
   revelations of the Bible.

   B. Consequences of the Spirituality of God.

   If God be a spirit, it follows of necessity that He is a person -- a
   self-conscious, intelligent, voluntary agent. As all this is involved
   in our consciousness of ourselves as spirit, it must all be true of
   God, or God is of a lower order of being than man.

   It follows also that God is a simple Being, not only as not composed of
   different elements, but also as not admitting of the distinction
   between substance and accidents. Nothing can either be added to, or
   taken from God. In this view the simplicity, as well as the other
   attributes of God, are of a higher order than the corresponding
   attributes of our spiritual nature. The soul of man is a simple
   substance; but it is subject to change. It can gain and lose knowledge,
   holiness, and power. These are in this view accidents in our substance.
   But in God they are attributes, essential and immutable.

   Finally, it follows from God's being a spirit, that He is a moral as
   well as an intelligent Being. It is involved in the very nature of
   rational voluntary being, that it should be conformed to the rule of
   right, which in the case of God is his own infinite reason. These are
   primary truths, which are not to be sacrificed to any speculative
   objections. It is vain to tell us that an infinite spirit cannot be a
   person, because personality implies self-consciousness, and
   self-consciousness implies the distinction between the self and the
   not-self, and this is a limitation. It is equally vain to say that God
   cannot have moral excellence, because moral goodness implies conformity
   to law, and conformity to law again is inconsistent with the idea of an
   absolute Being. These are empty speculations; and even if incapable of
   a satisfactory solution, would afford no rational ground for rejecting
   the intuitive truths of reason and conscience. There are mysteries
   enough in our nature, and yet no sane muan denies his own personal
   existence and moral accountability. And he is worse than insane who is
   beguiled by such sophistries into renouncing his faith in God as a
   personal Spirit and a loving Father.

   The Scriptures confirm these Views.

   It need hardly be remarked that the Scriptures everywhere represent God
   as possessing all the above-mentioned attributes of a spirit. On this
   foundation all religion rests; all intercourse with God, all worship,
   all prayer, all confidence in God as preserver, benefactor, and
   redeemer. The God of the Bible is a person. He spoke to Adam. He
   revealed himself to Noah. He entered into covenant with Abraham. He
   conversed with Moses, as a friend with friend. He everywhere uses the
   personal pronouns. He says, "I am," that "is my name." I am the Lord
   your God. I am merciful and gracious. Call upon me, and I will answer
   you. Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them
   that fear Him. O thou that hearest prayer, to thee shall all flesh
   come. Our Lord has put into our lips words which reveal that God is a
   spirit, and all that being a spirit implies, when He teaches us to say:
   "Our Father who art in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.
   Thy will be done." Everywhere the God of the Bible is contrasted within
   the gods of the heathen, as a God who sees, hears, and loves. These are
   not regulative, they are real truths. God does not mock us when He thus
   presents Himself to us as a personal Being within whom we can have
   intercourse, and who is everywhere present to help and save. "To human
   reason," says Mansel, "the personal and the infinite stand out in
   apparently irreconcilable antagonism; and the recognition of the one in
   a religious system almost inevitably involves the sacrifice of the
   other." [390] This cannot be so. According to the Bible, and according
   to the dictates of our own nature, of reason as well as of conscience,
   God is a spirit, and being a spirit is of necessity a person; a Being
   who can say I, and to whom we can say Thou.

   § 5. Infinity.

   Although God reveals Himself as a personal Being capable of fell
   worship with man, whom we can worship and love, and to whom we can pray
   with the assurance of being heard and answered; nevertheless He fills
   heaven and earth; He is exalted above all we can know or think. He is
   infinite in his being and perfections. The ideas with which we are most
   familiar are often those of which we are the least able to give an
   intelligent account. Space, time, and infinity, are among the most
   difficult problems of human thought. What is space? is a question which
   has never been satisfactorily answered. Some say it is nothing; where
   nothing is, space is not; it is "negation defined by boundary lines;"
   others, with Kant and Hamilton, say that it is "a condition of
   thought," "the subjective condition of sensibility;" others that it is
   an attribute or accident of God; others that it is that in which real
   existences can act and move. Notwithstanding these conflicting
   statements of philosophers, and the real obscurity of the subject,
   every man knows clearly and definitely what the word "space" means,
   although no man may be able to define it satisfactorily. It is much the
   same with the idea of infinity. If men would be content to leave the
   word in its integrity, as simply expressing what does not admit of
   limitation, there would be no danger in speculating about its nature.
   But in all ages wrong views of what the infinite is, have led to fatal
   errors in philosophy and religion. Without attempting to detail the
   speculations of philosophers on this subject, we shall simply endeavor
   to state what is meant when it is said that God is infinite in his
   being and perfections.

   The Idea of Infinity not merely Negative.

   Being, in this connection, is that which is or exists. The being of God
   is his essence or substance, of which his perfections are the essential
   attributes or modes of manifestation. When it is said that God is
   infinite as to his being, what is meant is, that no limitation can be
   assigned to his essence. It is often said that our idea of the infinite
   is merely negative. There is a sense in which this may be true, but
   there is a sense in which it is not true. It is true that the form of
   the proposition is negative when we say that no limit can be assigned
   to space, or possible duration, or to the being of God. But it implies
   the affirmation that the object of which infinity is predicated is
   illimitable. It is as much a positive idea which we express when we say
   a thing is infinite as when we say that it is finite. We cannot,
   indeed, form a conception or mental image of an infinite object, but
   the word nevertheless expresses a positive judgment of the mind. Sir
   William Hamilton and others, when they say that the infinite is a mere
   negation, mean that it implies a negation of all thought. That is, we
   mean nothing when we say that a thing is infinite. As we know nothing
   of the inhabitants of the other planets of our system, if such there
   be, or of the mode in which angels and disembodied spirits take
   cognizance of material objects, our ideas on such subjects are purely
   negative, or blank ignorance. "The infinite," Mansel says, "is not a
   positive object of human thought." [391] Every man, however, knows that
   the propositions "Space is infinite," and "Space is finite," express
   different and equally definite thoughts. When, therefore, we say that
   God is infinite, we mean something; we express a great and positive
   truth.

   A. The Infinite not the All.

   The infinite, although illimitable and incapable of increase, is not
   necessarily all. An infinite body must include all bodies, infinite
   space all portions of space, and infinite duration all periods of
   duration. Hence Mr. Mansel says that an infinite being must of
   necessity include within itself all actual and all possible forms or
   modes of being. So said Spinoza, many of the schoolmen, and even many
   Christian theologians. The sense in which Spinoza and Mansel make this
   assertion is the fundamental principle of Pantheism. Mr. Mansel, as we
   have seen, escapes that conclusion by appealing to faith, and teaching
   that we are constrained to believe what reason pronounces to be
   impossible, which itself is an impossibility. The sense in which
   theologians teach that an infinite being must comprehend within it all
   being, is, that in the infinite is the cause or ground of all that is
   actual or possible. Thus Howe [392] says, "Necessary being must include
   all being." But he immediately adds, not in the same way, "It
   comprehends all being, besides what itself is, as having had, within
   the compass of its productive power, whatsoever hath actually sprung
   from it; and having within the compass of the same power, whatsoever is
   still possible to he produced." This, however, is not the proper
   meaning of the words, nor is it the sense in which they are generally
   used. What the words mean, and what they are generally intended to mean
   by those who use them is, that there is only one being in the universe;
   that the finite is merely the modus existendi, or manifestation of the
   Infinite. Thus Cousin says, God must be "infinite and finite together,
   . . . . at the summit of being and at its humblest degree . . . . ; at
   once God, nature, and humanity." [393] Even some of the Remonstrants
   regard this as the necessary consequence of the doctrine of the
   infinitude of the divine essence. Episcopius [394] says, "Si essentia
   Dei sic immensa est, tum intelligi non potest quomodo et ubi aliqua
   creata essentia esse possit. Essentia enim creata non est essentia
   divina; ergo aut est extra essentiam divinam, aut, si non est extra
   eam, est ipsa essentia illa, et sic omnia sunt Deus et divina
   essentia." "God is infinite," says Jacob Bohme, "for God is all." This,
   says Strauss, [395] is exactly the doctrine of the modern philosophy.

   It has already been remarked in a previous chapter, in reference to
   this mode of reasoning, that it proceeds on a wrong idea of the
   infinite. A thing may be infinite in its own nature without precluding
   the possibility of the existence of things of a different nature. An
   infinite spirit does not forbid the assumption of the existence of
   matter. There may even be many infinites of the same kind, as we can
   imagine any number of infinite lines. The infinite, therefore, is not
   all. An infinite spirit is a spirit to whose attributes as a spirit no
   limits can be set. It no more precludes the existence of other spirits
   than infinite goodness precludes the existence of finite goodness, or
   infinite power the existence of finite power. God is infinite in being
   because no limit can be assigned to his perfections, and because He is
   present in all portions of space. A being is said to be present
   wherever it perceives and acts. As God perceives and acts everywhere,
   He is everywhere present. This however, does not preclude the presence
   of other beings. A multitude of men even may perceive and act at the
   same time and place. Besides, we have very little knowledge of the
   relation which spirit bears to space. We know that bodies occupy
   portions of space to the exclusion, of other bodies; but we do not know
   that spirits may not coexist in the same portion of space. A legion of
   demons dwelt in one man.

   B. Infinitude of God in relation to Space.

   The infinitude of God, so far as space is concerned, includes his
   immensity and his omnipresence. These are not different attributes, but
   one and the same attribute, viewed under different aspects. His
   immensity is the infinitude of his being, viewed as belonging to his
   nature from eternity. He fills immensity with his presence. His
   omnipresence is the infinitude of his being, viewed in relation to his
   creatures. He is equally present with all his creatures, at all times,
   and in all places. He is not far from any one of us. "The Lord is in
   this place," may be said with equal truth and confidence, everywhere.
   Theologians are accustomed to distinguish three modes of presence in
   space. Bodies are in space circumscriptively. They are bounded by it.
   Spirits are in space definitively. They have an ubi. They are not
   everywhere, but only somewhere. God is in space repletively. He fills
   all space. In other words, the limitations of space have no reference
   to Him. He is not absent from any portion of space, nor more present in
   one portion than in another. This of course is not to be understood of
   extension or diffusion. Extension is a property of matter, and cannot
   be predicated of God. If extended, He would be capable of division and
   separation; and part of God would be here, and part elsewhere. Nor is
   this omnipresence to be understood as a mere presence in knowledge and
   power. It is an omnipresence of the divine essence. Otherwise the
   essence of God would be limited. The doctrine, therefore, taught by the
   older Socinians that the essence of God is confined to heaven (wherever
   that may be), and that He is elsewhere only as to his knowledge and
   efficiency, is inconsistent with the divine perfections and with the
   representations of Scripture. As God acts everywhere, He is present
   everywhere; for, as the theologians say, a being can no more act where
   he is not than when he is not.

   The older and later theologians agree in this view of the divine
   immensity and omnipresence. Augustine [396] says God is not to be
   regarded as everywhere diffused, as the air or the light: "Sed in solo
   coelo totus, et in sola terra totus, et in coelo et in terra totus, et
   nullo contentus loco, sed in seipso ubique totus." Thomas Aquinas says,
   [397] Deus "est in omnibus per potentiam, in quantum omnia ejus
   potestati subduntur; est per præsentiam in omnibus, in quantum omnia
   nuda sunt et aperta oculis ejus. Est in omnibus per essentiam in
   quantum adest omnibus ut causa essendi sicut dictum est." Quenstedt
   says, [398] "Est Deus ubique illocaliter, impartibiliter, efficaciter;
   non definitive ut spiritus, non circumscriptive ut corpora, sed
   repletive citra sui multiplicationem, extensionem, divisionem,
   inclusionem, aut commixtionem more modoque divino incomprehensibili."
   The Bible teaches the infinitude of God, as involving his immensity and
   omnipresence, in the clearest terms. He is said to fill all in all,
   i.e., the universe in all its parts. (Eph. i. 23.) "Am I a God at hand,
   saith the Lord, and not a God afar off? Can any hide himself in secret
   places that I shall not see him? saith the Lord. Do not I fill heaven
   and earth? saith the Lord." (Jer. xxiii. 23, 24.) "Whither shall I go
   from thy Spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend
   up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou
   art there. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the
   uttermost parts of the sea; even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy
   right hand shall hold me." (Ps. cxxxix. 7-12.) It is "in Him we (i.e.,
   all creatures) live, and move, and have our being." (Acts xvii. 28.)
   Everywhere in the Old and in the New Testament, God is represented as a
   spiritual Being, without form, invisible, whom no man hath seen or can
   see; dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto, and full of
   glory; as not only the creator, and preserver, but as the governor of
   all things; as everywhere present, and everywhere imparting life, and
   securing order; present in every blade of grass, yet guiding Arcturus
   in his course, marshalling the stars as a host, calling them by their
   names; present also in every human soul, giving it understanding,
   endowing it with gifts, working in it both to will and to do. The human
   heart is in his hands and He turneth it even as the rivers of water are
   turned. Wherever, throughout the universe, there is evidence of mind in
   material causes, there, according to the Scriptures, is God,
   controlling and guiding those causes to the accomplishment of his wise
   designs. He is in all, and over all things; yet essentially different
   from all, being over all, independent, and infinitely exalted. This
   immensity and omnipresence of God, therefore, is the ubiquity of the
   divine essence, and consequently of the divine power, wisdom, and
   goodness. As the birds in the air and the fish in the sea, so also are
   we always surrounded and sustained by God. It is thus that He is
   infinite in his being, without absorbing all created beings into his
   own essence, but sustaining all in their individual subsistence, and in
   the exercise of their own powers.

   § 6. Eternity.

   A. Scriptural Doctrine.

   The infinitude of God relatively to space, is his immensity or
   omnipresence; relatively to duration, it is his eternity. As He is free
   from all the limitations of space, so He is exalted above all the
   limitations of time. As He is not more in one place than in another,
   but is everywhere equally present, so He does not exist during one
   period of duration more than another. With Him there is no distinction
   between the present, past, and future; but all things are equally and
   always present to Him. With Him duration is an eternal now. This is the
   popular and the Scriptural view of God's eternity. "Before the
   mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and
   the world, even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God." (Ps. xc.
   2.) "Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens
   are the work of thy hands. They shall perish, but thou shalt endure:
   yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou
   change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy
   years shall have no end." (Ps. cii. 25-27.) He is "The high and lofty
   One that inhabiteth eternity." (Is. lvii. 15.) "I am the first and I am
   the last; and besides me there is no God." (Is. xliv. 6.) "A thousand
   years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past." (Ps. xc. 4.)
   "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as
   one day." (2 Pet. iii. 8.) He is "the same yesterday, and today, and
   forever." (Heb. xiii. 8.) God is He "which is [ever is], and which was,
   and which is to come." (Rev. i. 4.) Throughout the Bible He is called
   the eternal or everlasting God; who only hath immortality. The primal
   revelation of Himself to his covenant people was as the "I am."

   What is taught in these and similar passages, is, first, that God is
   without beginning of years or end of days. He is, and always has been,
   and always will be; and secondly, that to Him there is neither past nor
   future; that the past and the future are always and equally present to
   Him.

   B. Philosophical View.

   These are Scriptural facts, and necessarily follow from the nature of
   God as self-existent, infinite, and immutable. With these
   representations the teaching of theologians for the most part agrees.
   Thus Augustine says: "Fuisse et futurum esse non est in ea [scil. vita
   divina], sed esse solum, quoniam æterna est: nam fuisse et futurum esse
   non est æternum." [399] "Nec tu tempore tempora præcedis, alioquin non
   omnia tempora præcederes sed præcedis omnia præterita celsitudine
   semper præsentis æternitatis; et superas omnia futura, quia illa futura
   sunt et cum venerint præterita erunt; tu autem idem ipse es, et anni
   tui non deficiunt." [400] Aquinas, to the same effect says, "Æternitas
   est tota simul." [401] Or, as the schoolmen generally were accustomed
   to say, "In æternitate est unicum instans semper præsens et
   persistens;" or, as they otherwise expressed it, "Eternitas est
   interminabilis vitæ simul et perfecta possessio." The same view of this
   attribute is given by the later theologians. Thus Quenstedt says,
   "Æternitas Dei est duratio vel permanentia essentiæ divinæ
   interminabilis, sine principio et fine carens, et indivisibilis, omnem
   omnino successionem excludens." [402]

   The only thing open to question in these statements is, the denial of
   all succession in the divine consciousness. Our idea of eternity is
   arrived at from our idea of time. We are conscious of existence in
   space, and we are conscious of protracted or continuous existence. The
   ideas of space and duration are necessarily given in the consciousness
   of continuous existence. We see also that events succeed each other,
   that their occurrence is separated by a longer or shorter period of
   duration, just as bodies are separated by a greater or less interval in
   space. We therefore know, from consciousness or from experience, of no
   kind of duration which is not successive. Instead of saying, as is
   commonly done, that time is duration measured by succession, which
   supposes that duration is antecedent to that by which it is measured,
   and independent of it, it is maintained by some that duration without
   succession is inconceivable and impossible. As space is defined to be
   "negation betwixt the boundary-lines of form," so time is said to be
   "the negation betwixt the boundary-points of motion." Or, in other
   words, time is "the interval which a body in motion marks in its
   transit from one point of space to another." [403] Hence, if there be
   no bodies having form, there is no space; and if there is no motion,
   there is no time. "If all things were annihilated, time as well as
   space must he annihilated; for time is dependent on space. If all
   things were annihilated, there could be no transition, no succession of
   one object with respect to another; for there would be no object in
   being, -- all would be perfect emptiness, nothingness, non-being-ness.
   Under an entire annihilation, there could be neither space nor time."
   [404] The same writer [405] elsewhere says, "Were the earth, as well as
   the other globes of space, annihilated, much more would time be
   annihilated therewith." [406] All this, however, is to be understood,
   it is said, of "objective time, that is, of time as dependent upon
   created material conditions." [407] As objective timelessness follows
   from the annihilation of material existences, so timelessness as
   regards thinking personalities is conceivable only on the destruction
   of thought. "We have seen that there can be a state of timelessness for
   material creation, only by destroying its operation, that is, its
   attribute of motion: precisely in analogy therewith, there can be a
   state of timelessness for intellectual creation, only by destroying the
   laws of intellect, that is, its operation of thinking." [408] If,
   therefore, God be a person, or a thinking Being, He cannot be timeless;
   there must be succession; one thought or state must follow another. To
   deny this, it is said, is to deny the personality of God. The dictum,
   therefore, of the schoolmen, and of the theologians, that eternity
   precludes succession -- that it is a persistent, unmoving Now -- is
   according to this repudiated.

   There are, however, two senses in which succession is denied to God.
   Time first has reference to external events. They are ever present to
   the mind of God. He views them in all their relations, whether causal
   or chronological. He sees how they succeed each other in time, as we
   see a passing pageant, all of which we may take in in one view. In this
   there is perhaps nothing which absolutely transcends our comprehension.
   The second aspect of the subject concerns the relation of succession to
   the thoughts and acts of God. When we are ignorant, it is wise to be
   silent. We have no right to affirm or deny, when we cannot know what
   our affirmation or denial may involve or imply. We know that God is
   constantly producing new effects, effects which succeed each other in
   time; but we do not know that these effects are due to successive
   exercises of the divine efficiency. It is, indeed, incomprehensible to
   us how it should be otherwise. The miracles of Christ were due to the
   immediate exercise of the divine efficiency. We utter words to which we
   can attach no meaning, when we say that these effects were due, not to
   a contemporaneous act or volition of the divine mind, but to an eternal
   act, if such a phrase be not a solecism. In like manner we are
   confounded when we are told that our prayers are not heard and answered
   in time -- that God is timeless -- that what He does in hearing and
   answering prayer, and in his daily providence, He does from eternity.
   It is certain that God is subject to all the limitations of
   personality, if there be any. But as such limitations are the
   conditions of his being a person and not a mere involuntary force, they
   are the conditions of his infinite perfection. As constant thought and
   activity are involved in the very nature of a spirit, these must belong
   to God; and so far as thinking and acting involve succession,
   succession must belong to God. There are mysteries connected with
   chronological succession, in our nature, which we cannot explain. We
   know that in dreams months may be compressed into moments, and moments
   extended to months, so far as our consciousness is concerned. We know
   that it often happens to those near death, that all the past becomes
   instantly present. Had God so constituted us that memory was as vivid
   as present consciousness, there would to us be no past, so far as our
   personal existence is concerned. It is not impossible that, hereafter,
   memory may become a consciousness of the past; that all we ever
   thought, felt, or did, may be ever present to the mind; that everything
   written on that tablet is indelible. Persons who, by long residence in
   foreign countries, have entirely lost all knowledge of their native
   language, have been known to speak it fluently, and understand it
   perfectly, when they came to die. Still more wonderful is the fact that
   uneducated persons, hearing passages read in an unknown language (Greek
   or Hebrew, for example), have, years after, when in an abnormal,
   nervous state, repeated those passages correctly, without understanding
   their meaning. If unable to comprehend ourselves, we should not pretend
   to be able to comprehend God. Whether we can understand how there can
   be succession in the thoughts of Him who inhabits eternity or not, we
   are not to deny that God is an intelligent Being, that He actually
   thinks and feels, in order to get over the difficulty. God is a person,
   and all that personality implies must be true of Him.

   Modern Philosophical Views.

   The modern philosophy teaches that "Die Ewigkeit ist die Einheit in dem
   Unterschiede der Zeitmomente -- Ewigkeit und Zeit verhalten sich wie
   die Substanz und deren Accidentien." [409] That is, Eternity is the
   unity underlying the successive moments of time, as substance is the
   unity underlying the accidents which are its manifestations.
   Schleiermacher's illustration is borrowed from our consciousness. We
   are conscious of an abiding, unchanging self, which is the subject of
   our ever changing thoughts and feelings. By the eternity of God,
   therefore, is meant nothing more than that He is the ground-being of
   which the universe is the ever changing phenomenon. The eternity of God
   is only one phase of his universal causality. "Unter der Ewigkeit
   Gottes verstehen wir die mit allem Zeitlichen auch die Zeit selbst
   bedingende schlechthin zeitlose Ursachlichkeit Gottes." [410] To attain
   this philosophical view of eternity, we must accept the philosophical
   view of the nature of God upon which it is founded, namely, that God is
   merely the designation of that unknown and unknowable something of
   which all other things are the manifestations. To give up the living,
   personal God of the Bible and of the heart, is an awful sacrifice to
   specious, logical consistency. We believe what we cannot understand. We
   believe what the Bible teaches as facts; that God always is, was, and
   ever will be, immutably the same; that all things are ever present to
   his view; that with Him there is neither past nor future; but
   nevertheless that He is not a stagnant ocean, but ever living, ever
   thinking, ever acting, and ever suiting his action to the exigencies of
   his creatures, and to the accomplishment of his infinitely wise
   designs. Whether we can harmonize these facts or not, is a matter of
   minor importance. We are constantly called upon to believe that things
   are, without being able to tell how they are, or even how they can be.

   § 7. Immutability.

   The immutability of God is intimately connected with his immensity and
   eternity, and is frequently included with them in the Scriptural
   statements concerning his nature. Thus, when it is said, He is the
   First and the Last; the Alpha and Omega, the same yesterday, to-day,
   and forever; or when in contrast with the ever changing and perishing
   world, it is said: "They shall be changed, but thou art the same;" it
   is not his eternity more than his immutability that is brought into
   view. As an infinite and absolute Being, self-existent and absolutely
   independent, God is exalted above all the causes of and even above the
   possibility of change. Infinite space and infinite duration cannot
   change. They must ever be what they are. So God is absolutely immutable
   in his essence and attributes. He can neither increase nor decrease. He
   is subject to no process of development, or of self-evolution. His
   knowledge and power can never be greater or less. He can never be wiser
   or holier, or more righteous or more merciful than He ever has been and
   ever must be. He is no less immutable in his plans and purposes.
   Infinite in wisdom, there can be no error in their conception; infinite
   in power, there can be no failure in their accomplishment. He is "the
   Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of
   turning." (James i. 17.) "God is not a man that He should lie; neither
   the son of man that He should repent; hath He said and shall He not do
   it? or hath he spoken, and shall He not make it good?" (Num. xxiii.
   19.) "I am the LORD, I change not." (Mal. iii. 6.) "The counsel of the
   LORD standeth forever; the thoughts of his heart to all generations."
   (Ps. xxxiii. 11.) "There are many devices in a man's heart;
   nevertheless, the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand." (Prov. xix.
   21.) "The Lord of Hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought,
   so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand."
   (Is. xiv. 24.) "I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end
   from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet
   done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure."
   (Is. xlvi. 9, 10.) Those passages of Scripture in which God is said to
   repent, are to be interpreted on the same principle as those in which
   He is said to ride upon the wings of the wind, or to walk through the
   earth. These create no difficulty.

   Philosophical Statement.

   Theologians, in their attempts to state, in philosophical language, the
   doctrine of the Bible on the unchangeableness of God, are apt to
   confound immutability with immobility. In denying that God can change,
   they seem to deny that He can act. Augustine says, on this subject:
   "Non invenies in Deo aliquid mutabilitatis; non aliquid, quod aliter
   nunc sit, aliter paulo ante fuerit. Nam ubi invenis aliter et aliter,
   facta est ibi quædam mors: mors enim est, non esse quod fuit." [411]
   Quenstedt uses language still more open to objection, when he says that
   the immutability of God is "Perpetua essentiæ divinæ et omnium ejus
   perfectionum identitas, negans omnem omnino motum cum physicum, tum
   ethicum." [412] Turrettin is more cautious, and yet perhaps goes too
   far. He says: "Potestas variandi actus suos, non est principium
   mutabilitatis in se, sed tantum in objectis suis; nisi intelligatur de
   variatione internorum suorum actuum, quos voluntas perfecta non variat,
   sed imperfecta tantum." [413] The clause italicized in the above
   quotation assumes a knowledge of the nature of God to which man has no
   legitimate claim. It is in vain for us to presume to understand the
   Almighty to perfection. We know that God is immutable in his being, his
   perfections, and his purposes; and we know that He is perpetually
   active. And, therefore, activity and immutability must be compatible;
   and no explanation of the latter inconsistent with the former ought to
   be admitted.

   The Absolute Attributes of God not inconsistent with Personality.

   These attributes of infinity, eternity, and immutability, are freely
   admitted by the modern philosophy to belong to the absolute Being. But
   it is maintained that such a Being cannot be a person. Personality
   implies self-consciousness. Self-consciousness necessarily implies
   limitation, a distinction between the self and the not-self. Ohne Du
   kein Ich, -- unless there be something objective and independent to
   which we stand opposed, as subject and object, there can be no
   consciousness of self. But nothing can be thus objective and
   independent in relation to the Absolute; and, therefore, the Absolute
   cannot have any consciousness of self, and consequently cannot be a
   personal Being. We have already seen (chap. iv.) that this objection is
   founded on an arbitrary definition of the Infinite and Absolute. It
   assumes that the Infinite must be all, and that the Absolute must be
   alone, without relation to anything out of itself. It is here only
   necessary to remark, in reference to the objection, (1.) That it may be
   admitted as a fact that the slumbering consciousness of self in the
   human soul is awakened and developed by contact with what is not only
   external to itself but also independent of it. But God is not subject
   to that law. He is eternally perfect and immutable; having in Himself
   the plenitude of life. There is, therefore, no analogy between the
   cases, and no ground for inferring in this case that what is true in
   us, who begin life as an undeveloped germ, must be true in relation to
   God. (2.) In the second place, we have no right to assume that even
   with regard to a finite intelligence created in the perfection of its
   being, self-consciousness is dependent on what is independent of
   itself. Such a being would of necessity be conscious of its own
   feelings; for thought is a state of consciousness in an intelligent
   being. If God, therefore, can make an intelligent being in the
   perfection of its limited nature, it would be self-conscious even were
   it left alone in the universe. (3.) Admitting it to be true that
   "without a Thou there can be no I," we know that, according to the
   Scriptures and the faith of the Church universal, there are in the
   unity of the Godhead three distinct persons, the Father, the Son, and
   the Spirit; so that from eternity the Father can say I, and the Son
   Thou.

   We must abide by the teachings of Scripture, and refuse to subordinate
   their authority and the intuitive convictions of our moral and
   religious nature to the arbitrary definitions of any philosophical
   system. The Bible everywhere teaches that God is an absolute Being, in
   the sense of being self-existent, necessary, independent, immutable,
   eternal, and without limitation or necessary relation to anything out
   of Himself. It teaches moreover that He is infinite; not in the sense
   of including all being, all power, all knowledge in Himself, to the
   exclusion of all other intelligent agents; but in the sense that no
   limit can be assigned to his being or perfections, other than that
   which arises out of his own perfection itself. He would cease to be
   infinite could He be unwise or untrue. It is to be remembered that God
   is infinite and absolute as a spirit, and a spirit from its nature is
   living, active, intelligent, self-conscious, and personal.

   § 8. Knowledge.

   A. Its Nature.

   By knowledge is meant the intellectual apprehension of truth. It
   supposes a subject and object; an intelligent subject that apprehends,
   and something true that is apprehended.

   So far as we are concerned, knowledge is either intuitive or
   discursive. Our senses give us immediate knowledge of their appropriate
   objects; the understanding perceives intuitively primary truths; our
   moral and æsthetic nature gives us the immediate cognition of things
   right or wrong, and beautiful or deformed. Most of our knowledge,
   however, is derived ab extra, by instruction, observation, comparison,
   deduction, etc. In all cases there is the distinction between the mind
   which perceives and the object which is perceived.

   Such being the nature of knowledge, can there be knowledge in God? Can
   there be this distinction between subject and object in an absolute and
   infinite Being? Not only are the wicked and the worldly disposed to
   think that God cannot know; that either He is too exalted to take
   cognizance of earthly things; or that it is impossible even for an
   infinite mind to embrace the universe and all its perpetual changes in
   his mental vision; but the possibility of knowledge, in the ordinary
   and proper sense of the word, is expressly denied to God by a large
   class of philosophers, and virtually even by many theologians of the
   highest rank in the history of the Church.

   The Pantheistic Theory precludes the possibility of Knowledge of God

   1. As, according to the pantheistic theory, the universe is the
   existence form of God, as the infinite comes to intelligent
   consciousness and life only in the finite, there is and can be no
   knowledge in the infinite as distinguished from the finite. God lives
   only so far as finite beings live; he thinks and knows only so far as
   they think and know. Omniscience is only the sum or aggregate of the
   intelligence of the transient forms of finite beings. All this, as even
   Hamilton and Mansel admit, necessarily flows from the idea of an
   absolute Being which precludes the possibility of any such conditions
   or relations as are involved in consciousness or intelligence. Strauss
   therefore says: [414] "Not in Himself, but in finite intelligences is
   God omniscient, which together constitute the fulness or completeness
   of all the possible forms or degrees of knowledge." And Spinoza says:
   [415] "Intellectus et voluntas, qui Dei essentiam constituerent, a
   nostro intellectu et voluntate toto coelo differe deberent, nec in ulla
   re, præterquam in nomine, convenire possent; non aliter scilicet, quam
   inter se conveniunt canis, signum coeleste, et canis, animal latrans."
   This subject was considered in the chapter on Pantheism.

   Knowledge and Power not to be confounded.

   2. The possibility of knowledge in God is virtually denied by those who
   deny any distinction between knowledge and power. Knowledge, which is
   power, ceases to be knowledge; and therefore if omniscience is only a
   different name for omnipotence, it ceases to be a distinct attribute of
   God. It makes little difference whether we expressly deny a given
   perfection to God, or whether we so determine it as to make it mean
   nothing distinctive. It is deeply to be regretted that not only the
   Fathers, but also the Lutheran and Reformed theologians, after
   renouncing the authority of the schoolmen, almost immediately yielded
   themselves to their speculations. Instead of determining the nature of
   the divine attributes from the representations of Scripture and from
   the constitution of man as the image of God, and from the necessities
   of our moral and religious nature, they allowed themselves to be
   controlled by à priori speculations as to the nature of the infinite
   and absolute. Even Augustine, as before stated, says: "Nos ista, quæ
   fecisti videmus, quia sunt: tu autem quia vides ea, sunt." [416] And
   Scotus Erigena says, [417] "Voluntas illius et visio et essentia anum
   est." [418] . . . . "Visio Dei totius universitatis est conditio. Non
   enim aliud est ei videre, aliud facere; sed visio illius voluntas ejus
   est, et voluntas operatio." Thomas Aquinas also says, [419] "Deus per
   intellectum suum causat res, cum suum esse sit suum intelligere. Unde
   necesse est, quod sua scientia sit causa rerum."

   The Lutheran and Reformed theologians represent God as simplicissima
   simplicitas, admitting of no distinction between faculty and act, or
   between one attribute and another. Thus Gerhard says: "Deus est ipsum
   esse subsistens, omnibus modis indeterminatum." [420] "Solus Deus summe
   simplex est, ut nec actus et potentiæ, nec esse et essentiæ compositio
   ipsi competat." [421] "Essentia, bonitas, potentia, sapientia,
   justitia, et reliqua attributa omnia sunt in Deo realiter unum." [422]
   He also says: "In Deo idem est esse et intelligere et velle." In like
   manner the Reformed theologian Heidegger [423] says: "Voluntas ab
   intellectu non differt, quia intelligendo vult et volendo intelligit.
   Intelligere et velle ejus idemque perpetuus indivisus actus." This does
   not mean simply that in an intelligent being, every act of the will is
   an intelligent act. He knows while he wills, and knows what he wills.
   The meaning is, that knowledge and power in God are identical. To know
   a thing is, and to will it, are the same undivided and perpetual act.
   From this it would seem to follow, that as God knows from eternity He
   creates from eternity; and that "all He knows, is." We are thus led, by
   these speculations, into pantheistical views of the nature of God and
   of his relation to the world.

   This mode of representation is carried still further by the modern
   philosophical theologians. With Schleiermacher, all the attributes of
   God are virtually merged into the idea of causality. With him God is
   ens summum prima causa. [424] He says that God's thinking and willing
   are the same, and that his omnipotence and omniscience are identical.
   When we say that He is omnipotent, we only mean that He is the cause of
   all that is. And when we say that He is omniscient, we only mean that
   He is an intelligent cause. His power and knowledge are limited to the
   actual. The possible is nothing; it is the object neither of knowledge
   nor of power. "Gott," says Schleiermacher, "weiss Alles was ist; und
   Alles ist, was Gott weiss und dieses beides ist nicht zweierlei sondern
   einerlei, weil sein Wissen und sein allmächtiges Wollen eines und
   dasselbe ist," i.e., God knows all that is, and all is that God knows.
   God, therefore, is limited to the world, which is the phenomenon of
   which He is the substance.

   Another philosophical view of this subject, adopted even by those who
   repudiate the pantheistic system and maintain that God and the world
   are distinct, is, that as God is immanent in the world, there is in Him
   no difference between self-consciousness and world-consciousness, as
   they express it, i.e., between God's knowledge of Himself and his
   knowledge of the world. They therefore define omniscience by saying,
   "Insofern Gott gedacht wird als die Welt mit seinem Bewusstseyn
   umfassend, nennen wir ihn den Allwissenden." [425] That is, "So far as
   we conceive of God as embracing the world in his consciousness, we call
   him omniscient." Whatever such language may mean to those who use it,
   to the ordinary mind it conveys the revolting idea that all the sins of
   men enter into the consciousness of God.

   The Doctrine of the Scriptures on this Subject.

   The Scriptural view of this subject, which distinguishes the attributes
   in God as distinct, and assumes that knowledge in Him, in its essential
   nature, is what knowledge is in us, does not conflict with the unity
   and simplicity of God as a spiritual being. There is a sense in which
   knowledge and power, intellect and will, may be said to be identical in
   man. They are not different substances. They are different modes in
   which the life or activity of the soul manifests itself. So in God when
   we conceive of Him as a spirit, we do not think of Him as a compound
   being, but as manifesting his infinite life and activity, in knowing,
   willing, and doing. What, therefore, we must hold fast to, if we would
   hold fast to God, is, that knowledge in God is knowledge, and not power
   or eternity; that it is what knowledge is in us, not indeed in its
   modes and objects, but in its essential nature. We must remove from our
   conceptions of the divine attributes all the limitations and
   imperfections which belong to the corresponding attributes in us; but
   we are not to destroy their nature. And in determining what is, and
   what is not, consistent with the nature of God as an infinitely perfect
   being, we are to be controlled by the teachings of the Scriptures, and
   by the necessities (or laws) of our moral and religions nature, and not
   by our speculative notions of the Infinite and Absolute. God,
   therefore, does and can know in the ordinary and proper sense of that
   word. He is an ever present eye, to which all things are perfectly
   revealed. "All things," says the Apostle, "are naked and opened unto
   the eyes of Him with whom we have to do." (Heb. iv. 13.) "The darkness
   and the light are both alike" to Him. (Ps. cxxxix. 12.) "He that
   planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he
   not see?" (Ps. xciv. 9.) "O Lord thou hast searched me, and known me.
   Thou knowest my down-sitting and my up-rising, thou understandest my
   thought afar off." (Ps. cxxxix. 1, 2.) "The eyes of the Lord are in
   every place, beholding the evil and the good" (Prov. xv. 3.) "Hell and
   destruction are before the Lord: how much more then the hearts of the
   children of men?" (Prov. xv. 11.) "Great is our Lord and of great
   power: his understanding is infinite." (Ps. cxlvii. 5.) "O house of
   Israel I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them."
   (Ezek. xi. 5.) "Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of
   the world." (Acts. xv. 18.) "The very hairs of your head are all
   numbered." (Matt. x. 30.)

   This knowledge of God is not only all-comprehending, but it is
   intuitive and immutable. He knows all things as they are, being as
   being, phenomena as phenomena, the possible as possible, the actual as
   actual, the necessary as necessary, the free as free, the past as past,
   the present as present, the future as future. Although all things are
   ever present in his view, yet He sees them as successive in time. The
   vast procession of events, thoughts, feelings, and acts, stands open to
   his view.

   This infinite knowledge of God is not only clearly and constantly
   asserted in Scripture, but is also obviously included in the idea of an
   absolutely perfect being. Such a being cannot be ignorant of anything;
   his knowledge can neither be increased nor diminished. The omniscience
   of God follows also from his omnipresence. As God fills heaven and
   earth, all things are transacted in his presence. He knows our thoughts
   far better than they are known to ourselves. This plenitude of divine
   knowledge is taken for granted in all acts of worship. We pray to a God
   who, we believe, knows our state and wants, who hears what we say, and
   who is able to meet all our necessities. Unless God were thus
   omniscient, He could not judge the world in righteousness. Faith in
   this attribute in its integrity is, therefore, essential even to
   natural religion.

   B. The Objects of Divine Knowledge.

   Various distinctions are made by theologians as to the objects of the
   divine knowledge.

   1. God is said to know Himself and all things out of Himself. This is
   the foundation of the distinction between the scientia necessaria and
   the scientia libera. God knows Himself by the necessity of his nature;
   but as everything out of Himself depends for its existence or
   occurrence upon his will, his knowledge of each thing as an actual
   occurrence is suspended on his will, and in that sense is free.
   Creation not being necessary, it depended on the will of God whether
   the universe as an object of knowledge should exist or not. This
   distinction is not of much importance. And it is liable to the
   objection that it makes the knowledge of God dependent. Being the cause
   of all things, God knows everything by knowing Himself; all things
   possible, by the knowledge of his power, and all things actual, by the
   knowledge of his own purposes.

   2. This distinction between the possible and actual, is the foundation
   of the distinction between the knowledge of simple intelligence and the
   knowledge of vision. The former is founded on God's power, and the
   latter upon his will. This only means that, in virtue of his omniscient
   intelligence, He knows whatever infinite power can effect; and that
   from the consciousness of his own purposes, He knows what He has
   determined to effect or to permit to occur. This is a distinction which
   the modern philosophical theologians ignore. Nothing, according to
   their philosophy is possible, but the actual. All that can be, either
   is, or is to be. This follows from the idea of God as mere cause. He
   produces all that can be; and there is in Him no causality for what
   does not exist.

   The Actual and the Possible.

   It seems to be an inconsistency in those orthodox theologians who deny
   the distinction in God between knowledge and power, to admit, as they
   all do, the distinction between the actual and possible. For if God
   creates by thinking or knowing, if in Him, as they say, intelligere et
   facere idem est, then all he knows must be, and must be as soon as He
   knows or thinks it, i.e., from eternity. If, however, we retain the
   Scriptural idea of God as a spirit, who can do more than He does; if we
   ascribe to Him what we know to be a perfection in ourselves, namely,
   that our power exceeds our acts, that a faculty and the exercise of
   that faculty are not identical, then we can understand how God can know
   the possible as well as the actual. God is not limited to the universe,
   which of necessity is finite. God has not exhausted Himself in
   determining to cause the present order of things to be.

   C. Scientia Media.

   Intermediate between things possible and actual, some theologians
   assume a third class of events, namely, the conditionally future. They
   do not actually occur, but they would occur provided something else
   should occur. Had Christ come a thousand years sooner than the date of
   his actual advent, the whole history of the world would have been
   different. This is a popular mode of regarding the concatenation of
   events. It is constantly said, that if Cromwell had been permitted to
   leave England; or, if Napoleon had failed to escape from Elba, the
   state of Europe would have been very different from what it is at
   present. God, it is assumed, knows what would have been the sequence of
   events on any or every possible hypothesis. It is therefore said that
   there must be in God, besides the knowledge of simple intelligence by
   which He knows the possible, and the knowledge of vision by which He
   knows the actual, a scientia media, by which He knows the conditionally
   future. Illustrations of this form of knowledge, it is thought, are
   found in Scripture. In 1 Samuel xxiii. 11, it is said that David
   inquired of the Lord whether the men of Keilah would deliver him,
   should he remain among them, into the hands of Saul; and was answered
   that they would. Here, it is argued, the event was not merely possible,
   but conditionally certain. If David remained in Keilah, he certainly
   would have been delivered up. Thus our Lord said, that if his mighty
   works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, the people of those cities would
   have repented. Here again is declared what would have happened, if
   something else had happened.

   The Origin of this Distinction.

   This distinction was introduced into theology by the Jesuit theologians
   Fonseca and Molina; by the latter in his work "De Concordia Providentiæ
   et Gratiæ Divinæ cum Libero Arbitrio Hominis." Their object was to
   reconcile the foreordination of God with the freedom of man, and to
   explain the reason why some, and not others, were elected to eternal
   life. God foresaw who would repent and believe, if they received the
   knowledge of the Gospel and the gift of the Spirit, and these He
   elected to salvation. This theory of a scientia media was, for a like
   purpose, adopted by the Lutheran and Remonstrant theologians, but was
   strenuously opposed by the Reformed or Augustinians. (1.) Because all
   events are included under the categories of the actual and possible;
   and, therefore, there is no room for such a class as events
   conditionally future. It is only possible, and not certain, how men
   would act under certain conditions, if their conduct be not
   predetermined, either by the purpose of God, or by their own decision
   already formed. Besides, it is the fundamental principle of the
   theologians who adopt this theory, or at least of many of them, that a
   free act must from its nature be uncertain as to its occurrence. A free
   agent, it is said, can always act contrary to any amount of influence
   brought to bear upon him, consistent with his free agency. But if free
   acts must be uncertain, they cannot be foreseen as certain under any
   conditions. (2.) The futurition of events, according to the Scriptures,
   depends on the foreordination of God, who foreordains whatever comes to
   pass. There is no certainty, therefore, which does not depend on the
   divine purpose. (3.) The kind of knowledge which this theory supposes
   cannot belong to God, because it is inferential. It is deduced from a
   consideration of second causes and their influence, and therefore is
   inconsistent with the perfection of God, whose knowledge is not
   discursive, but independent and intuitive. (4.) This theory is
   inconsistent with the Scriptural doctrine of God's providential
   government, as it assumes that the free acts of men are not under his
   control. (5.) It is contrary to the Scriptural doctrine, inasmuch as it
   supposes that election to salvation depends on the foresight of faith
   and repentance, whereas it depends on the good pleasure of God. (6.)
   The examples quoted from the Bible do not prove that there is a
   scientia media in God. The answer of God to David, about the men of
   Keilah, was simply a revelation of the purpose which they had already
   formed. Our Lord's declaration concerning Tyre and Sidon was only a
   figurative mode of stating the fact that the men of his generation were
   more hardened than the inhabitants of those ancient cities. It is not
   denied that God knows all events in all possible combinations and
   connections, but as nothing is certain but what he ordains to effect or
   permit, there can be no class of events conditionally future, and
   therefore there can be no scientia media. By conditionally future is
   meant what is suspended on a condition undetermined by God.

   D. Foreknowledge.

   Among the objects of the divine knowledge are the free acts of men. The
   Scriptures abundantly teach that such acts are foreknown. Such
   knowledge is involved in the prediction of events which either concern
   the free acts of men, or are dependent on them. If God be ignorant of
   how free agents will act, his knowledge must be limited, and it must be
   constantly increasing, which is altogether inconsistent with the true
   idea of his nature. His government of the world also, in that case,
   must be precarious, dependent, as it would then be on the unforeseen
   conduct of men. The Church, therefore, in obedience to the Scriptures,
   has, almost with one voice, professed faith in God's foreknowledge of
   the free acts of his creatures.

   The Socinians, however, and some of the Remonstrants, unable to
   reconcile this foreknowledge with human liberty, deny that free acts
   can be foreknown. As the omnipotence of God is his ability to do
   whatever is possible, so his omniscience is his knowledge of everything
   knowable. But as free acts are in their nature uncertain, as they may
   or may not be, they cannot be known before they occur. Such is the
   argument of Socinus. This whole difficulty arises out of the assumption
   that contingency is essential to free agency. If an act may be certain
   as to its occurrence, and yet free as to the mode of its occurrence,
   the difficulty vanishes. That free acts may be absolutely certain, is
   plain, because they have in a multitude of cases been predicted. It was
   certain that the acts of Christ would be holy, yet they were free. The
   continued holiness of the saints in heaven is certain, and yet they are
   perfectly free. The foreknowledge of God is inconsistent with a false
   theory of free agency, but not with the true doctrine on that subject.

   After Augustine, the common way of meeting the difficulty of
   reconciling foreknowledge with liberty, was to represent it as merely
   subjective. The distinction between knowledge and foreknowledge is only
   in us. There is no such difference in God. "Quid est præscientia," asks
   Augustine, "nisi scientia futurorum? Quid autem futurum est Deo, qui
   omnia supergreditur tempora? Si enim scientia Dei res ipsas habet, non
   sunt ei futuræ, sed præsentes, ac per hoc non jam præscientia, sed
   tantum scientia dicipotest." [426]

   E. The Wisdom of God.

   Wisdom and knowledge are intimately related. The former is manifested
   in the selection of proper ends, and of proper means for the
   accomplishment of those ends. As there is abundant evidence of design
   in the works of nature, so all the works of God declare his wisdom.
   They show, from the most minute to the greatest, the most wonderful
   adaptation of means to accomplish the high end of the good of his
   creatures and the manifestation of his own glory. So also, in the whole
   course of history, we see evidence of the controlling power of God
   making all things work together for the best interests of his people,
   and the promotion of his kingdom upon earth. It is, however, in the
   work of redemption that this divine attribute is specially revealed. It
   is by the Church, that God has determined to manifest, through all
   ages, to principalities and powers, his manifold wisdom.

   Of course those who deny final causes deny that there is any such
   attribute as wisdom in God. It is also said that the use of means to
   attain an end is a manifestation of weakness. It is further urged that
   it is derogatory to God, as it supposes that He needs or desires what
   He does not possess. Even Schleiermacher says: "Bei Gott ist
   Allwissenheit und Weisheit so gänzlich einerlei, dass die
   Unterscheidung keinen Werth hat, die Weisheit wäre nichts als auch
   wider absolute Lebendigkeit der Allmacht, also Alwissenheit." Wisdom is
   omniscience, omniscience is omnipotence, omnipotence is simply
   causality of all that is. Thus God sinks into the mere cause or ground
   of all things. It is not thus the Scriptures speak. We are called on to
   worship, "The only wise God." "O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in
   wisdom hast Thou made them all," is the devout exclamation of the
   Psalmist. (Ps. civ. 24.) And in contemplation of the work of redemption
   the Apostle exclaims, "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and
   knowledge of God!" (Rom. xi. 33.)

   § 9. The Will of God.

   A. The Meaning of the Term.

   If God is a spirit He must possess all the essential attributes of a
   spirit. Those attributes, according to the classification adopted by
   the older philosophers and theologians, fall under the heads of
   intelligence and will. To the former, are referred knowledge and
   wisdom; to the latter, the power of self-determination, efficiency (in
   the case of God, omnipotence), and all moral attributes. In this wide
   sense of the word, the will of God includes: (1.) The will in the
   narrow sense of the word. (2.) His power. (3.) His love and all his
   moral perfections. In our day, generally but not always, the word
   "will" is limited to the faculty of self-determination. And even the
   older theologians in treating of the will of God treat only of his
   decrees or purposes. In their definitions, however, they take the word
   in its wide sense. Thus Calovius [427] says, "Voluntas Dei est, qua
   Deus tendit in bonum ab intellectu cognitum." And Quenstedt defines it
   as "ipsa Dei essentia cum, connotatione inclinationis ad bonum
   concepta." [428] Turrettin says, the object of the intellect is the
   true; the object of the will, the good. Hence it is said, that God
   wills Himself necessarily, and all things out of Himself freely.
   Although the word seems to be taken in different senses in the same
   sentence, God's willing Himself means that He takes complacency in his
   own infinite excellence: his willing things out of Himself, means his
   purpose that they should exist. Although the theologians start with the
   wide definition of the word, yet in the prosecution of the subject they
   regard the will as simply the faculty of self-determination, and the
   determinations themselves. That is, the power to will, and volitions or
   purposes. It is altogether better to confine the word to this its
   proper meaning, and not make it include all the forms of feeling
   involving approbation or delight.

   God then as a spirit is a voluntary agent. We are authorized to ascribe
   to Him the power of self-determination. This the Bible everywhere does.
   From the beginning to the end, it speaks of the will of God, of his
   decrees, purposes, counsels, and commands. The will is not only an
   essential attribute of our spiritual being, but it is the necessary
   condition of our personality. Without the power of rational
   self-determination we should be as much a mere force as electricity, or
   magnetism, or the principle of vegetable life. It is, therefore, to
   degrade God below the sphere of being which we ourselves occupy, as
   rational creatures, to deny to Him the power of self-determination; of
   acting or not acting, according to his own good pleasure.

   B. The Freedom of the Divine Will.

   The will of God is free in the highest sense of the word. An agent is
   said to be free, (1.) When he is at liberty to act or not to act,
   according to his good pleasure. This is liberty in acting. (2.) He is
   free as to his volitions, when they are determined by his own sense of
   what is wise, right, or desirable.

   Freedom is more than spontaneity. The affections are spontaneous, but
   are not free. Loving and hating, delighting in and abhorring, do not
   depend upon the will.

   God is free in acting, as in creating and preserving, because these
   acts do not arise from the necessity of his nature. He was free to
   create or not create; to continue the universe in existence or to cause
   it to cease to be. He is free also in keeping his promises, because his
   purpose so to do is determined by his own infinite goodness. It is
   indeed inconceivable that God should violate his word. But this only
   proves that moral certainty may be as inexorable as necessity.

   C. The Decretive and Preceptive Will of God.

   The decretive will of God concerns his purposes, and relates to the
   futurition of events. The preceptive will relates to the rule of duty
   for his rational creatures. He decrees whatever he purposes to effect
   or to permit. He prescribes, according to his own will, what his
   creatures should do, or abstain from doing. The decretive and
   preceptive will of God can never be in conflict. God never decrees to
   do, or to cause others to do, what He forbids. He may, as we see He
   does, decree to permit what He forbids. He permits men to sin, although
   sin is forbidden. This is more scholastically expressed by the
   theologians by saying, A positive decretive will cannot consist with a
   negative preceptive will; i.e., God cannot decree to make men sin. But
   a negative decretive will may consist with an affirmative preceptive
   will; e.g., God may command men to repent and believe, and yet, for
   wise reasons, abstain from giving them repentance.

   The distinction between voluntas beneplaciti et signi, as those terms
   are commonly used, is the same as that between the decretive and
   preceptive will of God. The one referring to his decrees, founded on
   his good pleasure; the other to his commands, founded on what He
   approves or disapproves.

   By the secret will of God, is meant his purposes, as still hidden in
   his own mind; by his revealed will, his precepts and his purposes, as
   far as they are made known to his creatures.

   D. Antecedent and Consequent Will.

   These terms, as used by Augustinians, have reference to the relation of
   the decrees to each other. In the order of nature the end precedes the
   means, and the purpose of the former is antecedent to the purpose of
   the latter. Thus it is said, that God by an antecedent will, determined
   on the manifestation of his glory; and by a consequent will, determined
   on the creation of the world as a means to that end.

   By Lutherans and Remonstrants these terms are used in a very different
   sense. According to their views, God by an antecedent will determined
   to save all men; but, foreseeing that all would not repent and believe,
   by a subsequent will He determined to save those who he foresaw would
   believe. That is, He first purposed one thing and then another.

   E. Absolute and Conditional Will.

   These terms, when employed by Augustinians, have reference not so much
   to the purposes of God, as to the events which are decreed. The event,
   but not the purpose of God, is conditional. A man reaps, if he sows. He
   is saved, if he believes. His reaping and salvation are conditional
   events. But the purpose of God is absolute. If He purposes that a man
   shall reap, He purposes that he shall sow; if He purposes that he shall
   be saved, He purposes that he shall believe. Anti-Augustinians, on the
   other hand, regard the purposes of God as conditional. He purposes the
   salvation of a man, if he believes. But whether he believes or not, is
   left undetermined; so that the purpose of God is suspended on a
   condition not under his control, or, at least, undecided. A father may
   purpose to give an estate to his son, if he be obedient; but whether
   the son will fulfil the condition is undetermined, and therefore the
   purpose of the father is undecided. It is, however, manifestly
   inconsistent with the perfection of God, that He should first will one
   thing and then another; nor can his purposes be dependent on the
   uncertainty of human conduct or events. These are questions, however,
   which belong to the consideration of the doctrine of decrees. They are
   mentioned here because these distinctions occur in all discussions
   concerning the Divine Will, with which the student of theology should
   be familiar.

   In this place it is sufficient to remark, that the Greek word thelo,
   and the corresponding English verb, to will, sometimes express feeling,
   and sometimes a purpose. Thus in Matt. xxvii. 48, the words ei thelei
   auton are correctly rendered, "if he delight in him." Comp. Ps. xxii.
   8. It is in this sense the word is used, when it is said that God wills
   all men to be saved. He cannot be said to purpose or determine upon any
   event which is not to come to pass. A judge may will the happiness of a
   man whom he sentences to death. He may will him not to suffer when he
   wills him to suffer. The infelicity in such forms of expression is that
   the word "will" is used in different senses. In one part of the
   sentence it means desire, and in the other purpose. It is perfectly
   consistent, therefore, that God, as a benevolent Being, should desire
   the happiness of all men, while he purposes to save only his own
   people.

   F. The Will of God as the Ground of Moral Obligation.

   The question on this subject is, Whether things are right or wrong,
   simply because God commands or forbids them? Or, does He command or
   forbid them, because they are right or wrong for some other reason than
   his will? According to some, the only reason that a thing is right, and
   therefore obligatory, is, that it tends to promote the greatest
   happiness, or the greatest good of the universe. According to others, a
   thing is right which tends to promote our own happiness; and for that
   reason, and for that reason alone, it is obligatory. If vice would make
   us happier than virtue, we should be bound to be vicious. It is a more
   decorous mode of expressing substantially the same theory, to say that
   the ground of moral obligation is a regard to the dignity of our own
   nature. It makes little difference whether it be our own dignity of our
   own happiness, which we are bound to regard. It is self, in either
   case, to whom our whole allegiance is due. Others, again, place the
   ground of moral obligation in the fitness of things, which they exalt
   above God. There is, they affirm, an eternal and necessary difference
   between right and wrong, to which God, it is said, is as much bound to
   be conformed as are his rational creatures.

   The common doctrine of Christians on this subject is, that the will of
   God is the ultimate ground of moral obligation to all rational
   creatures. No higher reason can be assigned why anything is right than
   that God commands it. This means, (1.) That the divine will is the only
   rule for deciding what is right and what is wrong. (2.) That his will
   is that which binds us, or that to which we are bound to be conformed.
   By the word "will" is not meant any arbitrary purpose, so that it were
   conceivable that God should will right to be wrong, or wrong right. The
   will of God is the expression or revelation of his nature, or is
   determined by it; so that his will, as revealed, makes known to us what
   infinite wisdom and goodness demand. Sometimes things are right simply
   because God has commanded them; as circumcision, and other ritual
   institutions were to the Jews. Other things are right because of the
   present constitution of things which God has ordained; such as the
   duties relating to property, and the permanent relations of society.
   Others, again, are right because they are demanded by the immutable
   excellence of God. In all cases, however, so far as we are concerned,
   it is his will that binds us, and constitutes the difference between
   right and wrong; his will, that is, as the expression of his infinite
   perfection. So that the ultimate foundation of moral obligation is the
   nature of God.

   § 10. The Power of God.

   A. The Nature of Power, or, The Origin of the Idea.

   We get the idea of power from our own consciousness. That is, we are
   conscious of the ability of producing effects. Power in man is confined
   within very narrow limits. We can change the current of our thoughts,
   or fix our attention on a particular object and we can move the
   voluntary muscles of our body. Beyond this our direct power does not
   extend. It is from this small measure of efficiency that all the stores
   of human knowledge and all the wonders of human art are derived. It is
   only our thoughts, volitions, and purposes, together with certain acts
   of the body, that are immediately subject to the will. For all other
   effects we must avail ourselves of the use of means. We cannot will a
   book, a picture, or a house into existence. The production of such
   effects requires protracted labor and the use of diverse appliances.

   B. Omnipotence.

   It is by removing all the limitations of power, as it exists in us,
   that we rise to the idea of the omnipotence of God. We do not thus,
   however, lose the idea itself. Almighty power does not cease to be
   power. We can do very little. God can do whatever He wills. We, beyond
   very narrow limits, must use means to accomplish our ends. With God
   means are unnecessary. He wills, and it is done. He said, Let there be
   light; and there was light. He, by a volition created the heavens and
   the earth. At the volition of Christ, the winds ceased, and there was a
   great calm. By an act of the will He healed the sick, opened the eyes
   of the blind, and raised the dead. This simple idea of the omnipotence
   of God, that He can do without effort, and by a volition, whatever He
   wills, is the highest conceivable idea of power, and is that which is
   clearly presented in the Scriptures. In Gen. xvii. 1, it is said, "I am
   the Almighty God." The prophet Jeremiah exclaims, "Ah Lord God! behold
   thou hast made the heavens and the earth by thy great power, and
   stretched out arm; and there is nothing too hard for thee." (Jer.
   xxxii. 17.) God is said to have created all things by the breath of his
   mouth, and to uphold the universe by a word. Our Lord says, "With God
   all things are possible." (Matt. xix. 26.) The Psalmist long before had
   said, "Our God is in the heavens; He hath done whatsoever He pleased."
   (Ps. cxv. 3.) And again, "Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did He in
   heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places." (Ps. cxxxv.
   6.) The Lord God omnipotent reigneth, and doeth his pleasure among the
   armies of heaven and the inhabitants of the earth, is the tribute of
   adoration which the Scriptures everywhere render unto God, and the
   truth which they everywhere present as the ground of confidence to his
   people. This is all we know, and all we need to know on this subject:
   and here we might rest satisfied, were it not for the vain attempts of
   theologians to reconcile these simple and sublime truths of the Bible
   with their philosophical speculations.

   C. The Negation of Power.

   The sensuous school of philosophers deny that there is any real
   efficiency or power in existence. Their principle is, that all
   knowledge is derived from the senses; and consequently, that, as we
   cannot know anything of which the senses do not take cognizance, it is
   unphilosophical or unreasonable to admit the existence of anything
   else. Our senses, however, do not take cognizance of efficiency. It
   cannot be felt, or seen, or heard, or tasted. Therefore it does not
   exist. A cause is not that to which an effect is due, but simply that
   which uniformly precedes it. All we can know, and all we can rationally
   believe, is the facts which affect our senses, and the order of their
   sequence; which order, being uniform and necessary, has the character
   of law. This is the doctrine of causation proposed by Hume, Kant,
   Brown, Mill, and virtually by Sir William Hamilton; and it is this
   principle which lies at the foundation of the Positive Philosophy of
   Comte. Of course, if there be no such thing as power, there is no such
   attribute in God as omnipotence.

   It is sufficient to say, in this connection, in reference to this
   theory, (1.) That it is contrary to every man's consciousness. We are
   conscious of power, i.e., of the ability to produce effects. And
   consciousness has the same authority, to say the least, when it
   concerns what is within, as when it concerns what affects the senses.
   We are not more certain that our hand moves, than we are that we have
   the power to move, or not to move it, at pleasure. (2.) This theory
   contradicts the intuitive and indestructible convictions of the human
   mind. No man believes, or can believe really and permanently, that any
   change or effect can occur without an efficient cause. The fact that
   one event follows another, is not the ultimate fact. It is intuitively
   certain that there must be an adequate reason for that sequence. Such
   is the universal judgment of mankind. (3.) The argument, if valid
   against the reality of power, is valid against the existence of
   substance, of mind, and of God. This is admitted by the consistent
   advocates of the principle in question. Substance, mind, and God, are
   as little under the cognizance of the senses as power; and, therefore,
   if nothing is to be admitted but on the testimony of the senses, the
   existence of substance, mind, and God, must be denied. This principle,
   therefore, cannot be admitted without doing violence to our whole
   rational, moral, and religious nature. In other words, it cannot be
   admitted at all; for men cannot, permanently, either believe or act
   contrary to the laws of their nature.

   D. Absolute Power.

   By absolute power, as understood by the schoolmen and some of the later
   philosophers, is meant power free from all the restraints of reason and
   morality. According to this doctrine, contradictions, absurdities, and
   immoralities, are all within the compass of the divine power. Nay, it
   is said that God can annihilate Himself. On this subject Des Cartes
   says, Deus "non voluit tres angulos trianguli æquales esse duobus
   rectis, quia cognovit aliter fieri non posse. Sed contra . . . . quia
   voluit tres angulos trianguli necessario æquales esse duobus rectis,
   idcirco jam hoc verum est, et fieri aliter non potest, atque ita de
   reliquis." [429] This "summa indifferentia," he says, "in Deo, summum
   est ejus omnipotentiæ argumentam." [430]

   It is, however, involved in the very idea of power, that it has
   reference to the production of possible effects. It is no more a
   limitation of power that it cannot effect the impossible, than it is of
   reason that it cannot comprehend the absurd, or of infinite goodness
   that it cannot do wrong. It is contrary to its nature. Instead of
   exalting, it degrades God, to suppose that He can be other than He is,
   or that He can act contrary to infinite wisdom and love. When,
   therefore, it is said that God is omnipotent because He can do whatever
   He wills, it is to be remembered that his will is determined by his
   nature. It is certainly no limitation to perfection to say that it
   cannot be imperfect.

   In this view of the omnipotence of God, the great body of the
   theologians, especially among the Reformed, agree. Thus Zwingle [431]
   says: "Summa potentia non est nisi omnia possit, quantum ad legitimum
   posse attinet: nam malum facere aut se ipsum deponere aut in se
   converti hostiliter aut sibi ipsi contrarium esse posse impotentia est,
   non potentia." Musculus, [432] "Deus omnipotens, quia potest quæ vult,
   quæque ejus veritati, justitiæ conveniunt." Keckermann, [433] "Absolute
   possibilia sunt, quæ nec Dei naturæ, nec aliarum rerum extra Deum
   essentiæ contradicunt." This scholastic doctrine of absolute power
   Calvin [434] stigmatizes as profane, "quod . . . . merito detestabile
   nobis esse debet."

   Potentia Absoluta and Potentia Ordinata.

   There is a sense of the terms in which absolute power is generally
   recognized among theologians. A distinction is commonly made between
   the potentia absoluta and the potentia ordinata of God. By the latter
   is meant the efficiency of God, as exercised uniformly in the ordered
   operation of second causes; by the former, his efficiency, as exercised
   without the intervention of second causes. Creation, miracles,
   immediate revelation, inspiration, and regeneration, are to be referred
   to the potentia absoluta of God; all his works of providence to his
   potentia ordinata. This distinction is important, as it draws the line
   between the natural and supernatural, between what is due to the
   operation of natural causes, sustained and guided by the providential
   efficiency of God, and what is due to the immediate exercise of his
   power. This distinction, indeed, is rejected by the modern philosophy.
   God in creating and sustaining the world, does it as a whole. Nothing
   is isolated. There is no individual act, but only a general efficiency
   on the part of God; and, consequently, no particular event can be
   referred to his absolute power or immediate agency. Everything is
   natural. There can be no miracle, and no special providence. [435]

   E. Confounding Will and Power.

   Another perversion of the Scriptural doctrine on this subject is, that
   which denies any distinction between will and power, or faculty and
   act, in God. It is said that it is unphilosophical to say that God can
   do anything. We use the word "can" only in reference to difficulty to
   be overcome. When nothing stands in the way, when all opposition is
   precluded, then we no longer say, we can. It is, therefore,
   inconsistent with the nature of an absolute Being to say that He is
   able to do this or that. [436] It is further denied that willing can be
   ascribed to God, if any difference be assumed between willing and
   doing. The ordinary definition of omnipotence, Potest quod vult, is to
   be rejected. It is admitted, that the distinction between will and
   power is unavoidable, if we determine the nature of God from the
   analogy of our constitution. As will and power are distinct in us, we
   are disposed to think they are distinct in Him. But this method of
   determining the attributes of God heads to the destruction of the true
   idea of an absolute being. In such a being, no such distinction can be
   admitted; and therefore, in relation to God there can be no distinction
   between the actual and the possible. Nothing is possible but the
   actual; and all that is possible becomes actual. Strauss [437] says,
   after Schleiermacher, [438] that by the omnipotence of God is to be
   understood "not only that all that is has its causality in God, but
   that everything is and occurs for which any causality in God exists."
   Bruch [439] says, that by the omnipotence of God is meant nothing more
   than that He is the original ground and cause of all things. He quotes
   Nitsch [440] as saying, that "The idea of omnipotence is the repetition
   and application of the idea of God as creator of heaven and earth."
   Nitsch, however, does not understand the passage in the sense put upon
   it; for he adds, in his note commenting on the dictum of Abelard, "Deus
   non potest facere aliquid præter ea quæ facit," that, if this means
   that the actual exhausts the resources of God, it is to be rejected.
   The words of Abelard, nevertheless, correctly express the doctrine of
   the modern German school of theologians on this subject.
   Schleiermacher's language on this point is explicit and comprehensive.
   "Alles ist ganz durch die göttliche Allmacht und ganz durch den
   Naturzusammenhang, nicht aber darf die erstere als Ergänzung der
   letztern angesehen werden. Die Gesammtheit des endlichen Seins ist als
   vollkommene Darstellung der Allmacht zu denken, so dass alles wirklich
   ist und geschieht, wozu eine Productivität in Gott ist. Damit fällt weg
   die Differenz des Wirklichen und Möglichen, des absoluten und
   hypothetischen Wollens oder Könnens Gottes; denn dies führt auf einen
   wirksamen und unwirksamen Willen und letzterer kann bei Gott unmöglich
   statt finden; so wenig als Können und Wollen getrennt sein können."
   That is, "Everything is entirely through the divine omnipotence, and
   everything is through the course of nature. The former, however, must
   not be regarded as supplementary to the latter. The aggregate of finite
   things is the complete revelation of God's omnipotence, so that
   everything is and occurs for which there is a productivity in God. Thus
   the difference between the actual and the possible, between the
   absolute and hypothetical willing and power of God, disappears, because
   this implies an operative and inoperative will, but the latter is
   impossible in God; just as little as willing and power can be
   separated." [441] This passage is quoted by Schweizer, [442] who adopts
   the views which it presents.

   This Doctrine Destroys our Knowledge of God.

   In reference to this doctrine, it may be remarked, --

   1. That it utterly confounds all our ideas of God. It renders all
   knowledge of Him impossible. If will and power are identical, then
   those words lose for us their meaning. We cannot know what God is, if
   this doctrine be true; and if we know not what He is, we cannot
   rationally worship, love, or trust Him.

   2. The doctrine effectually destroys the personality of God. A person
   is a self-conscious, self-determining being. But in denying will to
   God, self-determination, and consequently personality, is denied to
   Him. This consequence is admitted by the advocates of this doctrine.
   "If in God," says Strauss, "willing and power are identical, then there
   can be no freedom of the will in God, in the sense of the Church
   theologians, who hold that it was possible for God not to create the
   world, or to have created it other than it is. If there be no ability
   in God to do what He does not do, there can be no freedom of will or
   power of choice." "Mit diesem Können fällt auch die Freiheit im Sinne
   eines Wahlvermögens hinweg." [443] This, however, it is said, is not
   the doctrine of fate; for fate supposes an ab extra necessity to which
   God is subject. If it does not teach fate, it at least teaches
   inexorable necessity. Spinoza says, "Ea res libera dicetur, quæ ex sola
   suæ naturæ necessitate existit et a se sola ad agendum determinatur.
   Necessaria autem, vel potius coacta quæ ab alio determinatur ad
   existendum et operandum certa ac determinata ratione." [444] And again,
   [445] "Deum nullo modo fato subjicio, sed omnia inevitabili necessitate
   ex Dei natura sequi concipio." In this sense the sun is free in
   shining. It shines from the necessity of its nature. We think from a
   like necessity; but we can think of one thing or another, changing the
   current of our thoughts at pleasure. And thus we are free in exercising
   the power of thought. This freedom is denied to God. He can think only
   in one way. And all his thoughts are creative. He does, therefore, what
   He does, from a necessity of his nature, and does all He is able to do.
   God, according to this doctrine, is not a personal Being.

   3. The Scriptures constantly represent God as able to do whatever He
   wills. They recognize the distinction between the actual and the
   possible; between ability and act; between what God does, and what He
   is able to do. With Him all things are possible. He is able of stones
   to raise up children unto Abraham. He can send me, says our Lord,
   twelve legions of angels.

   4. As this is the doctrine of the Bible, it is the instinctive judgment
   of the human mind. It is a perfection in us, that we can do far more
   than we actually accomplish. With us the actual is not the measure of
   the possible.

   5. It is, therefore, a limitation of God, a denial of his omnipotence,
   to say that He can do only what He actually brings to pass. There is
   infinitely more in God than simple causality of the actual.

   It is consequently an erroneous definition of omnipotence to call it
   All-power, meaning thereby that all the efficiency in the universe is
   the efficiency of God; which is not only a pantheistic doctrine, but it
   makes the finite the measure of the infinite.

   § 11. Holiness of God.

   This is a general term for the moral excellence of God. In 1 Sam. ii.
   2, it is said, "There is none holy as the Lord;" no other Being
   absolutely pure, and free from all limitation in his moral perfection.
   "Thou Holy One of Israel," is the form of address which the Spirit puts
   into the lips of the people of God. "Exalt the Lord our God, and
   worship at his holy hill; for the Lord our God is Holy." (Ps. xcix. 9.)
   "Holy and reverend is his name." (Ps. cxi. 9.) "Thou art of purer eyes
   than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity." (Hab. i. 13.)
   "Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for Thou only
   art Holy." (Rev. xv. 4.) Holiness, on the one hand, implies entire
   freedom from moral evil; and, upon the other, absolute moral
   perfection. Freedom from impurity is the primary idea of the word. To
   sanctify is to cleanse; to be holy, is to be clean. Infinite purity,
   even more than infinite knowledge or infinite power, is the object of
   reverence. Hence the Hebrew word qdvs, as used in Scripture, is often
   equivalent to venerandus."The Holy One of Israel," is He who is to be
   feared and adored. Seraphim round about the throne who cry day and
   night, Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of hosts, give expression to the
   feelings of all unfallen rational creatures in view of the infinite
   purity of God. They are the representatives of the whole universe, in
   offering this perpetual homage to the divine holiness. It is because of
   his holiness, that God is a consuming fire. And it was a view of his
   holiness which led the prophet to exclaim, "Woe is me! for I am undone;
   because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a
   people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the king, the Lord of
   hosts." (Is. vi. 5.)

   It is in their application to the moral attributes of God, that the two
   methods of determining his nature come most directly into conflict. If
   we allow ourselves to be determined in answering the question, What is
   God? by the teachings of his Word, and the constitution of our own
   nature; if we refer to Him, in an infinite degree, every good we find
   in ourselves, then we can have no hesitation in believing that He is
   holy, just, and good. But if the philosophical notion of the absolute
   and infinite is to decide every question concerning the divine nature,
   then we must give up all confidence in our apprehensions of God, as an
   object of knowledge. This Strauss, the most candid of the recent
   philosophical theologians, frankly admits. He says: "The ideas of the
   absolute and of the holy are incompatible. He who holds to the former
   must give up the latter, since holiness implies relation; and, on the
   other hand, he who holds fast the idea of God as holy, must renounce
   the idea of his being absolute; for the idea of absolute is
   inconsistent with the slightest possibility of its being other than it
   is. The impossibility of referring moral attributes to God had been
   admitted by some of the fathers of the Church." [446]

   The Reasons urged for denying Moral Attributes to God.

   The grounds on which it is denied that moral attributes can be
   predicated of God, are such as these : --

   1. To assume that God can delight in good, and hate evil, takes for
   granted that He is susceptible of impression ab extra, which is
   inconsistent with his nature.

   2. It is said that moral excellence implies subjection to a moral law.
   But an absolute and infinite Being cannot be thus subject to law. It is
   true that God is not subject to any law out of Himself. He is exlex,
   absolutely independent. He is a law unto Himself. The conformity of his
   will to reason is no subjection. It is only the harmony of his nature.
   God's being holy, implies nothing more than that He is not in conflict
   with Himself. On this point even the rationalistic theologian
   Wegscheider says: "Minime Deus cogitandus est tanquam pendens ex lege
   ethica vel eidem subjectus tanquam potestati cuidam alienæ, sed Deus
   sanctus ipsa ea lex est, natura quidam hypostatica indutus." [447]

   3. It is said that moral excellence must be free. A moral agent, to be
   holy, must voluntarily do right. But this implies that he is able to do
   wrong. There must, therefore, be at least a metaphysical possibility of
   God's being evil, or He cannot be good. But all possibility of the
   Absolute being other than it is, is inconsistent with its nature. To
   this it may be answered that the ideas of liberty and necessity are
   indeed antagonistic; but that liberty and absolute certainty are
   perfectly compatible. That an infinitely wise Being will not act
   irrationally, is as absolutely certain as that the self-contradictory
   cannot be true. The one is as inconceivable as the other. It is just as
   impossible that an infinitely holy Being should be unholy as that light
   should be darkness. The impossibility, however, is of a different kind.
   The former is what Augustine calls the felix necessitas boni, which is
   the highest idea of freedom.

   4. Strauss says that those who attribute moral perfections to God,
   forget that a purely spiritual Being can have nothing of what we call
   reason, wisdom, goodness, wrath, righteousness, etc. "Strictly
   speaking," he adds "the ascription of moral attributes to God supposes
   that He is material; and the most abstract theological ideas on the
   subject are really founded on Materialism." This is founded on the
   assumption that spirit is impersonal, a generic force, which becomes
   individual and personal only by union with a material organization,
   just as the Realists define man to be generic humanity, individualized
   and rendered personal by union with a given corporeal organization.

   It is surely most unreasonable to sacrifice to such speculations all
   religion, and all confidence in the intuitive judgments of the human
   mind, as well as all faith in God and in the Bible.

   It is scarcely less destructive of the true doctrine, to define
   holiness in God as the causality of conscience in us. That we are moral
   beings is not admitted to be a proof that God has moral attributes.
   That the sun produces cheerfulness in us is no proof that the sun is
   cheerful. But if we know nothing of God except that He is the cause of
   all things, He is to us only an inscrutable force, and not a Father,
   and not a God.

   § 12. Justice.

   A. Meaning of the Word.

   The word justice, or righteousness, is used in Scripture sometimes in a
   wider and sometimes in a more restricted sense. In theology, it is
   often distinguished as justitia interna, or moral excellence, and
   justitia externa, or rectitude of conduct. In Hebrew tsdyq means, in a
   physical sense, straight; and in a moral sense, right, what is as it
   should be. And tsdqh means rightness, that which satisfies the demands
   of rectitude or law. The Greek word dikaios has the physical sense of
   equal; and the moral sense of, conformed to what is right; and
   dikaiosune is either that which divides equally, i.e., equity in the
   moral sense, or that which satisfies the demands of right. The Latin
   justus and justitia are commonly used in the wide sense for what is
   right, or as it should be. Cicero [448] defines justitia as "animi
   affectio suum cuique tribuens." This definition he elsewhere amplifies,
   saying: "Justitia erga Deos religio, erga parentas pietas, creditis in
   rebus fides, in moderatione animadvertendi lenitas, amicitia in
   benevolentia nominatur." [449]

   When we regard God as the author of our moral nature, we conceive of
   Him as holy; when we regard Him in his dealings with his rational
   creatures, we conceive of Him as righteous. He is a righteous ruler;
   all his laws are holy, just, and good. In his moral government He
   faithfully adheres to those laws. He is impartial and uniform in their
   execution. As a judge he renders unto every man according to his works.
   He neither condemns the innocent, nor clears the guilty; neither does
   He ever punish with undue severity. Hence the justice of God is
   distinguished as rectoral, or that which is concerned in the imposition
   of righteous laws and in their impartial execution; and distributive,
   or that which is manifested in the righteous distribution of rewards
   and punishment. The Bible constantly represents God as a righteous
   ruler and a just judge. These two aspects of his character, or of our
   relation to Him, are not carefully distinguished. We have the assurance
   which runs through the Scriptures, that "The judge of all the earth"
   must "do right." (Gen. xviii. 25.) "God is a righteous judge." (Ps.
   vii. 11, marginal reading.) "He shall judge the world with
   righteousness." (Ps. xcvi. 13.) "Clouds and darkness are round about
   Him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne." (Ps.
   xcvii. 2.) Notwithstanding all the apparent inequalities in the
   distribution of his favours; notwithstanding the prosperity of the
   wicked and the afflictions of the righteous, the conviction is
   everywhere expressed that God is just; that somehow and somewhere He
   will vindicate his dealings with men, and show that He is righteous in
   all his ways and holy in all his works.

   B. Justice in its Relation to Sin.

   As the sense of guilt is universal among men, and as the manifestations
   of sin are so constant and pervading, it is mainly in its relation to
   sin that the justice of God is revealed. Hence many theologians define
   the justice of God as that attribute of his nature which is manifested
   in the punishment of sin. Goodness, it is said, is manifested in
   bestowing good, and justice in the infliction of punishment.
   Schleiermacher says, "Justice is that causality in God which connects
   suffering with actual sin." [450] Schweizer says, "We know God as just
   only through the punishment of sin." Hegel says, "The manifestation of
   the nothingness of the finite as power, is justice." This is the
   philosophical, statement of the principle that "Might is Right," a
   principle which underlies the morals and religion of the modern
   philosophy.

   C. The Reformation of the Offender is not the Primary Object of
   Punishment.

   As the justice of God is specially manifested in the punishment of sin,
   it is of primary importance to determine why sin is punished.

   One prevalent theory on this subject is, that the only legitimate end
   of punishment is the reformation of the offender.

   It is of course to be admitted, that the good of the offender is often
   the ground or reason why evil is inflicted. A father chastises a child
   in love, and for its good. And God, our heavenly Father, brings
   suffering upon his children for their edification. But evil inflicted
   for the benefit of the sufferer, is chastisement, and not punishment.
   Punishment, properly speaking, is evil inflicted in satisfaction of
   justice.

   That the good of the sufferer is not the primary end of the infliction
   of punishment, is proved : --

   1. Because the punishment of the wicked is always, in the Scriptures,
   referred to the anger of God, and the chastisement of his people to his
   love. The cases, therefore, are not analogous. This difference of
   representation is designed to teach us that the wicked and the good do
   not stand in the same relation to God, as objects of benevolence; but
   that the one He punishes to testify his disapprobation and satisfy his
   justice, and the other He chastises to bring them nearer to Himself.

   2. In many cases the nature of the punishment precludes the possibility
   of the good of the offender being the ground of its infliction. The
   deluge, the destruction of the cities of the plain, and the overthrow
   of Jerusalem, were certainly not designed for the benefit of the men
   who suffered from those desolating inflictions. Much less can it be
   assumed that the punishment of the fallen angels, and of the finally
   impenitent, is intended to be reformatory.

   3. Scripture and experience both teach that suffering, when of the
   nature of punishment, has no tendency to reform. When suffering is seen
   to come from a father's hand, and to be a manifestation of love, it has
   a sanctifying power; but when it comes from the hand of God, as a judge
   and an avenger, and is the expression of displeasure and a proof of our
   alienation from God, its tendency is to harden and to exasperate. Hence
   the Apostle says, that so long as men are under condemnation, they
   bring forth fruit unto sin; and that, only when reconciled to God and
   assured of his love, do they bring forth fruit unto God. The great New
   Testament prophet, in his vision of the world of woe, represents the
   lost as gnawing their tongues with pain and blaspheming God. The
   denunciation of punishment is addressed to fear, but fear is not the
   principle of genuine obedience.

   4. On this subject, appeal may be fairly made to the common
   consciousness of men. Such is our moral hebetude that it is only
   glaring offences which awaken our moral sensibilities, and reveal their
   true nature. When any great crime is committed, there is an instinctive
   and universal demand for the punishment of the criminal. No man can
   pretend that the desire for his reformation is the feeling which
   prompts that demand. That is not so much as thought of. It is the
   instinctive judgment of the mind that he ought to suffer. It is not
   benevolence towards him which calls for the infliction of punishment.

   D. The Prevention of Crime is not the Primary End of Punishment.

   The doctrine that the only legitimate end of punishment is the
   prevention of crime, has had great prevalence in the Church and the
   world. It is the common doctrine of jurists. It is, of course, to be
   conceded that the good of society and of the moral government of God,
   is one important end of punishment in all governments, human or divine.
   It is, however, rather an important collateral effect of the
   administration of justice, than its immediate design. The doctrine in
   question merges justice into benevolence. According to this way of
   thinking, it is only because God has a view to the happiness of his
   rational creatures, that He visits sin within punishment. This doctrine
   was adopted by some of the early fathers. In answer to the objection
   that the Bible represented God as a vindictive being, because it speaks
   of his anger and of his determination to punish, they said that He
   punished only out of benevolence. Thus Clemens Alexandrinus [451] says,
   "Men ask how God can be good and kind if He is angry and punishes? They
   should remember that punishment is for the good of the offender and for
   the prevention of evil." And Tertullian [452] says: "Omne hoc justitiæ
   opus procuratio bonitatis est." Origen, [453] also to the same effect,
   says: "Ex quibus omnibus constat, unum eundemque esse justum et bonum
   legis et evangeliorum Deum, et benefacere cum justitia et cum bonitate
   punire."

   Many later theologians take the same view. Leibnitz defines justice to
   be benevolence guided by wisdom. Wolf, who modified the whole system of
   theology in accordance with the philosophy of Leibnitz, adopted the
   same view. So did Stapfer, [454] who says: "Quando Deus ejusmodi malum
   triste ex peccato necessario se quens creaturæ accidere sinit, . . . .
   dicitur peccatorem punire, et hoc sensu ipsi tribuitur justitia
   vindicativa. In justitia punitiva bonitas cum sapientia administratur.
   [455] Notio justititæ resolvitur in notionem sapientiæ et bonitatis."
   Grotius, the jurist, makes this idea of justice the fundamental
   principle of his great work, "De Satisfactione Christi."

   The Optimist Theory.

   In this country the same view has been extensively adopted, and made,
   as it must of necessity be, the controlling principle of those systems
   of theology in which it is incorporated. It is assumed that happiness
   is the greatest good; and hence that the purpose and desire to promote
   happiness is the sum of all virtue. From this it follows, that this
   world, the work of a God of infinite benevolence, wisdom, and power,
   must be the best possible world for the production of happiness; and,
   therefore, the permission of sin, and its punishment, must be referred
   to the benevolence of God. They are the necessary means for securing
   the greatest amount of happiness. If happiness be not the greatest
   good; if holiness be a higher end than happiness; if expediency be not
   the ground and measure of moral obligation, it is obvious that this
   whole structure collapses.

   Proof of the Scriptural Doctrine.

   It is admitted that happiness is promoted by justice, and therefore
   that it is contrary to a wise benevolence that men should be allowed to
   sin with impunity. But justice cannot properly be merged into
   benevolence. And that the promotion of happiness by the prevention of
   crime is not the primary end of the infliction of punishment, is
   evident, --

   1. From the testimony of every man's consciousness. Every man knows
   that benevolence and justice, as revealed in his own consciousness, are
   different sentiments. The one prompts to the promotion of happiness,
   the other involves the instinctive judgment, that a criminal ought to
   suffer for his crime. We do not stop to ask, or to think, what may be
   the collateral effect on others of the infliction of punishment.
   Anterior to such reflection, and independent of it, is the intuitive
   perception, that sin should be punished, for its own sake, or on
   account of its inherent ill-desert. These instinctive moral judgments
   are as clear and as trustworthy revelations of the nature of God as can
   possibly be made. They force conviction in spite of all speculative
   sophistries. Every man knows the righteous judgment of God, that those
   who sin are worthy of death. If justice and benevolence are distinct in
   us, they are distinct in God. If we, in obedience to the nature which
   He has given us, intuitively perceive or judge that sin ought to be
   punished for its own sake, and irrespective of the good effect
   punishment may have on others, then such also is the judgment of God.
   This is the principle which underlies and determines all our ideas of
   the Supreme Being. If moral perfection be not in Him what it is in us,
   then He is to us an unknown something, and we use words without meaning
   when we speak of Him as holy, just, and good.

   Argument from the Religious Experience of Believers.

   2. This sense of justice, which is indestructible in the nature of man,
   and which, in common with reason and conscience, has survived the Fall,
   is not only revealed in the ordinary experience of men, but still more
   distinctly in their religious consciousness. What is commonly called
   "conviction of sin," is only a modification, and higher form, of those
   inward experiences which are common to all men. All men know that they
   are sinners. They all know that sin, as related to the justice of God,
   is guilt, that which ought to be punished; and that, as related to his
   holiness, it renders us polluted and offensive in his sight. They also
   know, intuitively, that God is just as well as holy; and, therefore,
   that his moral perfection calls for the punishment of sin, by the same
   necessity by which He disapproves of and hates it. Under the pressure
   of these convictions, and the consciousness of their utter inability
   either to satisfy divine justice, or to free themselves from the
   defilement and power of sin, men either tremble in the constant looking
   for of judgment, or they look out of themselves for help. When, under
   either the common or saving operations of the Spirit of God, these
   sentiments are deepened, then their nature is more clearly revealed. A
   man, when thus convinced of sin, sees that not only would it be right
   that he should be punished, but that the justice, or moral excellence
   of God, demands his punishment. It is not that he ought to suffer for
   the good of others, or to sustain the moral government of God, but that
   he, as a sinner and for his sins sought to suffer. Were he the only
   creature in the universe, this conviction would be the same, both in
   nature and degree. Such is the experience of men under the conviction
   of sin, as recorded in the Scriptures and in the history of the Church.
   In many cases criminals under the pressure of these feelings have
   delivered themselves to the officers of justice to be punished. More
   frequently they resort to self-inflicted tortures to satisfy the
   clamors of conscience. We have, therefore, an inward revelation, which
   can neither be suppressed nor perverted, that justice is not
   benevolence.

   The Sense of Justice not due to Christian Culture.

   3. That this sense of justice is not due to Christian culture, or to
   the influence of peculiar forms of doctrine, but belongs to the common
   consciousness of men, is plain. (a.) Because it is impressed upon all
   human languages as far as known or cultivated. All languages have
   different words for justice and benevolence. There could not be this
   difference in the words, if the sentiments themselves were not
   different. Every one knows that when we say a man is just, we mean one
   thing; and when we say he is benevolent, we mean another thing. (b.)
   All history as it records the workings of human nature, reveals this
   innate sense of justice. We everywhere hear men calling for the
   punishment of offenders, or denouncing those who allow them to escape
   with impunity. No mass of men ever witness a flagrant act of cruelty or
   wrong without an irrepressible manifestation of indignation. The voice
   of nature, which in such cases is the voice of God, demands the
   punishment of the wrong-doer. (c.) In all religions which reveal the
   inward convictions of men, there are expiatory rites. Every sacrifice
   for sin, the smoke from every altar, which has been going up through
   all ages and from every part of the world, are so many attestations to
   the truth of reason and of Scripture, that there is such an attribute
   as justice in God, distinct from his benevolence.

   Argument from the Holiness of God.

   4. The truth of this doctrine may also be inferred from the holiness of
   God. If He is infinitely pure, his nature must be opposed to all sin;
   and as his acts are determined by his nature, his disapprobation of sin
   must manifest itself in his acts. But the disfavour of God, the
   manifestation of his disapprobation, is death, as his favour is life.
   It cannot be that this essential opposition between holiness and sin
   should be dependent for its manifestation on the mere ab extra
   consideration that evil would result from sin being allowed to go
   unpunished. It might as well be said that we should feel no aversion to
   pain, unless aware that it weakened our constitution. We do not approve
   of holiness simply because it tends to produce happiness; neither do we
   disapprove of sin simply because it tends to produce misery. It is
   inevitable, therefore, that the perfection of the infinitely holy God
   should manifest its opposition to sin, without waiting to judge of the
   consequences of the expression of this divine repugnance.

   5. The doctrine that the prevention of crime is the only legitimate end
   of punishment, or that there is no such attribute in God as justice, as
   distinguished from benevolence, rests on the assumption, before
   remarked upon, that all virtue consists in benevolence; which again
   rests on the assumption that happiness is the highest good; which makes
   expediency the ground of moral obligation, and the rule of moral
   conduct. It is indeed a solecism to use the word moral in such
   connections, for, on this theory, the word has no meaning. A thing may
   be wise or unwise, expedient or inexpedient, but in no other sense
   right or wrong. Wrong becomes right, and right becomes wrong, as the
   greater amount of happiness flows from the one or from the other. As
   this utilitarian theory of morals has been banished from the schools of
   philosophy, it should be banished from systems of theology.

   Argument from the Connection between Sin and Misery.

   6. The inseparable connection between sin and misery is a revelation of
   the justice of God. That holiness promotes happiness is a revelation of
   the relation in which God stands to holiness; and that sin produces
   misery is no less a revelation of the relation in which He stands to
   moral evil. This constitution of things depending on the nature and
   will of God, proves that sin is evil in its own nature, and is punished
   for its own sake. The law of God which includes a penalty as well as
   precepts, is in both a revelation of the nature of God. If the precepts
   manifest his holiness, the penalty as clearly manifests his justice. If
   the one is immutable, so also is the other. The wages of sin is death.
   Death is what is due to it in justice, and what without injustice
   cannot be withheld from it. If the prevention of crime were the primary
   end of punishment, then if the punishment of the innocent, the
   execution, for example, of the wife and children of a murderer, would
   have a greater restraining influence than the punishment of the guilty
   murderer, their execution would be just. But this would shock the mural
   sense of men.

   Argument from the Scriptural Doctrines of Satisfaction and
   Justification.

   7. The Scriptural doctrines of satisfaction and justification rest on
   the principle that God is immutably just, i.e., that his moral
   excellence, in the case of sin, demands punishment, or expiation. The
   Bible clearly teaches the necessity of satisfaction to justice in order
   to the forgiveness of sin. Christ was set forth as a propitiation, in
   order that God might be just in justifying the ungodly. This assumes
   that it would be unjust, i.e., contrary to moral rectitude, to pardon
   the guilty without such a propitiation. This necessity for a
   satisfaction is never referred to expediency or to governmental
   considerations. If sin could have been pardoned, without a
   satisfaction. the Apostle says, Christ is dead in vain. (Gal. ii. 21.)
   If there could have been a law which could have given life, salvation
   would have been by the law (Gal. iii. 21.)

   Moreover, if there is no such attribute in God as justice, as
   distinguished from benevolence, then there can be no such thing as
   justification. There may be pardon, as the act of a sovereign remitting
   a penalty and restoring an offender to favour; but no such thing as
   justification, as an act of a judge proceeding according to law and
   pronouncing the demands of justice satisfied. The Scriptures, however,
   according to the almost unanimous judgment of the Church, pronounce
   that justification is more than an act of executive clemency.
   Conscience is not satisfied with mere forgiveness. It is essential to
   peace with God, that the soul should see that justice is satisfied.
   This is the reason why the death of Christ, why his blood, is so
   inexpressibly precious in the eyes of his people. All the experience of
   the saints is a protest against the principle that expiation is
   unnecessary, that sin can be pardoned without a satisfaction of
   justice.

   Paul's Argument.

   The whole argument of the Apostle in his Epistle to the Romans is
   founded on the principle that justice is a divine attribute distinct
   from benevolence. His argument is: God is just. All men are sinners.
   All, therefore, are guilty, i.e., under condemnation. Therefore no man
   can be justified, i.e., pronounced not guilty, on the ground of his
   character or conduct. Sinners cannot satisfy justice. But what they
   could not do, Christ, the Eternal Son of God, clothed in our nature,
   has done for them. He has brought in everlasting righteousness, which
   meets all the demands of the law. All those who renounce their own
   righteousness, and trust to the righteousness of Christ, God justifies
   and saves. This is the gospel as preached by Paul. It all rests on the
   assumption that God is just.

   The doctrine of the vindicatory justice, which has this clear evidence
   of its truth, in the moral nature of man, in the religious experience
   of believers, and in the teaching and doctrines of the Scriptures, has
   ever been considered as a turning point in theology.

   E. Philosophical Views of the Nature of Justice.

   The teachings of the Scriptures, and the faith of the Church, so far as
   the divine attributes are concerned, are founded on the assumption that
   God is a personal Being. It is involved in that assumption, not only
   that He possesses intelligence and moral character, but that he thinks,
   feels, wills, and acts. It is, moreover, involved in the idea of
   personality, that thinking, feeling, willing, and acting in God, are,
   in all that is essential, analogous to what those terms signify in us.
   The modern philosophy, however, teaches that, if God be an absolute
   Being, thinking, feeling, willing, and acting are inconsistent with his
   nature. Hence, --

   1. Some teach that God is only the original ground of beings having in
   Himself no distinctive attributes. What we call the attributes of God
   are only the attributes of finite creatures having the ground of their
   being in God. That they are intelligent, moral, voluntary agents, is no
   proof that the same is true of God. That the sun produces the sensation
   of heat in us is no proof that it experiences the same sensation. The
   attributes of God, therefore, are only different aspects of the
   causality in Him which produces different effects. Justice, then, is
   not an attribute of God; it is only the causality to which the
   connection between sin and suffering is to be referred.

   2. Others, while insisting that personality, and all that it involves,
   are incompatible with the idea of an absolute Being, still maintain
   that we are constrained, and bound, to believe in the personality of
   God, on the authority of the Bible and of our own moral nature. But the
   Bible reveals, it is said, not absolute, but only regulative truth; not
   what He is, but what it is expedient for us to think He is. Justice in
   God, then, is for us what generosity in a fairy is for nursery
   children.

   3. Others again, while they admit personality in God, make it a
   personality which precludes all willing, and all acting, except in the
   form of law, or general, uniform efficiency. Justice in God, therefore,
   is only a name for one form, or one mode, of the manifestation of the
   power of God. As it is to be referred to his ordination, or to his
   nature, that fire burns and acids corrode, so it is to be referred to
   his general efficiency that sin produces misery. There is no special
   intervention of God, when fire burns; and there is no special decision,
   or judgment on his part, when a sinner is punished. Punishment is not
   the execution of a sentence pronounced by an intelligent being on the
   merits of the case, but the operation of a general law. Bruch
   (Professor of Theology in the Theological Seminary in Strasbourg) is a
   representative of this mode of thinking. He professes Theism, or faith
   in a personal God, but he teaches that the attributes of God are
   nothing else (als die Modalitäten seiner ewigen Wirksamkeit) "than the
   modes if his constant efficiency." Since among men justice is exercised
   in a succession of special acts, it is erroneously inferred that there
   is a like succession of acts of the will of God by which He approves or
   condemns. The great difficulty, he says, arises from judging of God
   after the analogy of our own nature. He admits that the Bible does
   this; that it constantly speaks of God as a righteous judge,
   administering justice according to his will. In this case, however, he
   adds, it is important to separate the real truth from the imperfection
   of its Scriptural form. Penalties are not evils inflicted by a special
   act of the divine will, but the natural consequences of sin, which
   cannot fail to manifest themselves. There is an organic connection
   between sin and evil. All the activity or agency of God is in the form
   of laws having their foundation in his nature. Thus justice is simply
   that law, or uniform mode of divine operation, by which sin is made its
   own punishment. [456] Hence there is no distinction between natural and
   positive inflictions; the deluge was either no punishment, or it was
   the natural consequence of the sins of the antediluvians. Hence, there
   is no such thing as forgiveness. The only possible way to remove the
   suffering is to remove the sin. But how is the sin of theft or murder
   to be removed? We can understand how pride or envy may be subdued and
   the suffering they occasion be escaped: but how can a past act be
   removed? A man hardened in sin suffers little or nothing for a special
   offence; the morally refined suffer indescribably. Thus, according to
   this theory, the better a man is, the more severely he is punished for
   his sin. Strauss is consistent enough to carry the principle out, and
   discard altogether the ideas of reward and punishment, as belonging to
   a low form of thought. He quotes and adopts the dictum of Spinoza:
   "Beatitudo non est virtutis præmium, sed ipsa virtus."

   4. Scarcely distinguished from the doctrine last mentioned, is that
   presented by Dr. John Young. [457] His doctrine is that there are
   certain eternal and immutable laws arising out of the nature of things,
   independeimt of the will or nature of God, to which He is as much
   subject as his creatures. One of these laws is, that virtue produces
   happiness, and vice misery. The one is, therefore, rewarded, and the
   other punished, by the necessary and immutable operation of that law,
   and not by the will of God. God, therefore, ceases to be the ruler of
   the world. He is Himself subordinate to eternal and necessary laws.
   That this doctrine is at variance with the whole tenor of the Bible
   cannot be doubted. It is no less opposed to the dictates of our own
   moral and religious nature. It is revealed in that nature that we are
   subject, not to necessary and self-acting laws, but to an intelligent,
   personal God, to whom we are accountable for our character and conduct,
   and who rewards and punishes his creatures according to their works.

   As a philosophical theory, this doctrine is much below the standard of
   the German theologians. For they, as far as they are Theists, admit
   that these immutable laws are determined by the nature of God, and are
   the uniform modes of his operation. Indeed, as God and his creatures
   exhaust the whole category of being, the "nature of things," apart from
   the nature of God and of his creatures, seems to be a phrase without
   meaning. It is tantamount to the "nature of nonentity."

   § 13. The Goodness of God.

   A. The Scriptural Doctrine.

   Goodness, in the Scriptural sense of the term, includes benevolence,
   love, mercy, and grace. By benevolence is meant the disposition to
   promote happiness; all sensitive creatures are its objects. Love
   includes complacency, desire, and delight, and has rational beings for
   its objects. Mercy is kindness exercised towards the miserable, and
   includes pity, compassion, forbearance, and gentleness, which the
   Scriptures so abundantly ascribe to God. Grace is love exercised
   towards the unworthy. The love of a holy God to sinners is the most
   mysterious attribute of the divine nature. The manifestation of this
   attribute for the admiration and beatification of all intelligent
   creatures, is declared to be the special design of redemption. God
   saves sinners, we are told, "That in the ages to come He might show the
   exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us, through Christ
   Jesus." (Eph. ii. 7.) This is the burden of that Epistle.

   As all the modifications of goodness above mentioned are found even in
   our dilapidated nature, and commend themselves to our moral
   approbation, we know they must exist in God without measure and without
   end. In him they are infinite, eternal, and immutable.

   Benevolence.

   The goodness of God in the form of benevolence is revealed in the whole
   constitution of nature. As the universe teems with life, it teems also
   with enjoyment. There are no devices in nature for the promotion of
   pain for its own sake; whereas the manifestations of design for the
   production of happiness are beyond computation. The manifestation of
   the goodness of God in the form of love, and specially of love to the
   undeserving, is, as just stated, the great end of the work of
   redemption. "God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten
   Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have
   everlasting life." (John iii. 16.) "Herein is love, not that we loved
   God, but that He loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for
   our sins." (1 John iv. 10.) The Apostle prays that believers might be
   able to comprehend the height and depth, the length and breadth, of
   that love which passes knowledge. (Eph. iii. 19.)

   Love.

   Love in us includes complacency and delight in its object, with the
   desire of possession and communion. The schoolmen, and often the
   philosophical theologians, tell us that there is no feeling in God.
   This, they say, would imply passivity, or susceptibility of impression
   from without, which it is assumed is incompatible with the nature of
   God. "We must exclude," says Bruch, [458] "passivity from the idea of
   love, as it exists in God. For God cannot be the subject of passivity
   in any form. Besides, if God experienced complacency in intelligent
   beings, He would be dependent on them; which is inconsistent with his
   nature as an Absolute Being." Love, therefore, he defines as that
   attribute of God which secures the development of the rational
   universe; or, as Schleiermacher expresses it, "It is that attribute in
   virtue of which God communicates Himself." [459] According to the
   philosophers, the Infinite develops itself in the finite; this fact, in
   theological language, is due to love. The only point of analogy between
   love in us and love in the Absolute and Infinite, is
   self-communication. Love in us leads to self-revelation and communion;
   in point of fact the Infinite is revealed and developed in the
   universe, and specially in humanity. Bruch admits that this doctrine is
   in real contradiction to the representations of God in the Old
   Testament, and in apparent contradiction to those of the New Testament.
   If love in God is only a name for that which accounts for the rational
   universe; if God is love, simply because He develops himself in
   thinking and conscious beings, then the word has for us no definite
   meaning; it reveals to us nothing concerning the real nature of God.
   Here again we have to choose between a mere philosophical speculation
   and the clear testimony of the Bible, and of our own moral and
   religious nature. Love of necessity involves feeling, and if there be
   no feeling in God, there can be no love. That He produces happiness is
   no proof of love. The earth does that unconsciously and without design.
   Men often render others happy from vanity, from fear, or from caprice.
   Unless the production of happiness can be referred, not only to a
   conscious intention, but to a purpose dictated by kind feeling, it is
   no proof of benevolence. And unless the children of God are the objects
   of his complacency and delight, they are not the objects of his love.
   He may be cold, insensible, indifferent, or even unconscious; He ceases
   to be God in the sense of the Bible, and in the sense in which we need
   a God, unless He can love as well as know and act. The philosophical
   objection against ascribing feeling to God, bears, as we have seen,
   within equal force against the ascription to Him of knowledge or will.
   If that objection be valid, He becomes to us simply an unknown cause,
   what men of science call force; that to which all phenomena are to be
   referred, but of which we know nothing. We must adhere to the truth in
   its Scriptural form, or we lose it altogether. We must believe that God
   is love in the sense in which that word comes home to every human
   heart. The Scriptures do not mock us when they say, "Like as a father
   pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him." (Ps.
   ciii. 13.) He meant what He said when He proclaimed Himself as "The
   Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering and abundant
   in goodness and truth." (Ex. xxxiv. 6.) "Beloved," says the Apostle,
   "let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth
   is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God;
   for God is love. In this was manifested the love of God toward us,
   because that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world, that we
   might live through Him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that
   He loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation con our sins.
   Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another." (1
   John iv. 7-1l.) The word love has the same sense throughout this
   passage. God is love; and love in Him is, in all that is essential to
   its nature, what love is in us. Herein we do rejoice, yea, and will
   rejoice.

   B. The Existence of Evil.

   How can the existence of evil, physical and moral, be reconciled with
   the benevolence and holiness of a God infinite in his wisdom and power?
   This is the question which has exercised the reason and tried the faith
   of men in all ages of the world. Such is the distance between God and
   man, such the feebleness of our powers, and such the limited range of
   our vision, it might seem reasonable to leave this question to be
   answered by God himself. If a child cannot rationally sit in judgment
   on the conduct of his parents, nor a peasant comprehend the affairs of
   an empire, we certainly are not competent to call God to account, or to
   ask of Him the reason of his ways. We might rest satisfied with the
   assurance that the Judge of all the earth must do right. These
   considerations, however, have not availed to prevent speculation on
   this subject. The existence of evil is constantly brought forward by
   sceptics as an argument against religion; and it is constantly in the
   minds of believers as a difficulty and a doubt. While it is our duty to
   obey the injunction, "Be still and know that I am God," it is no less
   our duty to protest against those solutions of this great problem which
   either destroy the nature of sin or the nature of God.

   Theories which involve the Denial of Sin.

   Most of the theories proposed to account for the existence of evil,
   come under one or the other of the three following classes: First,
   those which really or virtually deny the existence of evil in the
   world. What we call evil is distinguished as physical and moral, pain
   and sin. There is some plausibility in the argument to prove that pain
   is not necessarily an evil. It is necessary to the safety of sentient
   creatures. But pain exists far beyond the bounds of this necessity.
   Such is the amount and variety of suffering in the world, of the just
   and of the unjust, of infants and of adults, that no philosophy can
   smother the conviction that the misery which weighs so heavily on the
   children of men, is an appalling evil. There is no such trial to our
   faith, as to see an infant suffering excruciating pain. If, however,
   pain could be removed from the category of evil, sin is not so easily
   disposed of. The world lies in wickedness. The history of man is, to a
   large degree, the history of sin. If God be holy, wise, and omnipotent,
   how can we account for this widely extended and long-continued
   prevalence of sin?

   One solution is sought in the denial that sin is an evil. In other
   words, it is denied that there is any such thing as sin. What we so
   regard is, as some maintain, nothing more than limitation of being. To
   be free from sin, we must be free from limitation, i.e.. infinite. It
   is not an evil that one tree is smaller, less beautiful, or less
   valuable than others; or that a plant has not the sensitive life of an
   animal; or that all animals have not the rational powers of man. As in
   a forest, we see trees of every shape and size, perfectly and
   imperfectly developed, and this diversity is itself a good; so among
   men there are some more, and some less conformed to the ideal standard
   of reason and right, but this is not an evil. It is only diversity of
   development; the manifold forms of an endless life.

   Others say that what we call sin is the necessary condition of virtue.
   There can be no action without reaction; no strength without obstacles
   to be overcome; no pleasure without pain; and no virtue without vice.
   Moral goodness is mastery over moral evil. There cannot be one without
   the other. All would be dead and motionless, a stagnant sea, were it
   not for this antagonism.

   Others again say that sin has only a subjective reality. It is
   analogous to pain. Some things affect us agreeably, others
   disagreeably; some excite self-approbation, some disapprobation. But
   that is simply our own concern. God no more participates in our
   judgments than He does in our sensations.

   Others do not so expressly deny the existence of sin. They admit that
   it is not only evil to us, but that it involves guilt in the sight of
   God, and therefore should be punished. Nevertheless, they represent it
   as arising necessarily out of the constitution of our nature. All
   creatures are subject to the law of development -- to a "Werden."
   Perfection is a goal to be reached by a gradual process. This law
   controls every sphere of life, vegetable, animal, intellectual, and
   moral. Every plant is developed from a seed. Our bodies begin in a
   germ; infancy is feeble and suffering. Our minds are subject to the
   same law. They are, of necessity, open to error. Our moral life is not
   an exception to this rule. Moral beings, at least those constituted as
   we are, cannot avoid sin. It is incident to their nature and condition.
   It is to be outlived and overcome. If the world be so constituted and
   so directed that there is a continued progress toward perfection; if
   all evil, and especially all sin, be eliminated by this progress, the
   wisdom, goodness, and holiness of God will be thereby vindicated. Bruch
   [460] asks, "Why has God (der heilige Urgeist) brought men into the
   world with only the potentiality of freedom (which with him includes
   perfection), and not with the actuality, but left that perfection to be
   attained by a long process of development? The only answer to that
   question," he says, is, "that development lies in the very nature of
   the finite. It must strive toward perfection by an endless process,
   without ever reaching it in its fulness. We might as well ask why God
   has ordained that the tree should be developed from a germ? or why the
   earth itself has passed through so many periods of change, ever from a
   lower to a higher state? or why the universe is made up of things
   finite, and is itself finite?" He adds the further consideration, "that
   God, with the possibility of sin, has provided redemption by which it
   is to be overcome, banished, and swallowed up." "The annihilation of
   sin is the design of the whole work of redemption. The Son of Man is
   come that He might destroy the works of the devil.' (1 John iii. 8.)
   Sin, however, will disappear only when not the individual alone, but
   when the whole race of man has reached the goal of its destination, --
   and when," he asks, "will this happen?" [461] That question he leaves
   unanswered. On a following page, however, he quotes Klaiber [462] as
   saying: "Divine revelation gives the only possible and satisfactory
   answer to the question, how the existence of sin can be reconciled with
   the holiness of God, an answer which satisfies not only our pious
   feelings, but our anthropological and theological speculations, in that
   it makes known the truth that God determined on the creation of beings,
   who, as free agents, were subject to the possibility of sin, and who
   were through their own fault sunk in evil, in connection with
   redemption; so that sin is only a transient, vanishing phenomenon in
   the development of finite beings. This is the great idea which pervades
   the whole of revelation; yea, which is its essence and its goal."

   It is obvious that all theories which make sin a necessary evil,
   destroy its nature as revealed in Scripture, and in our own
   consciousness.

   Sin considered as the Necessary Means of the Greatest Good.

   A much more plausible theory, belonging to the class of those which
   virtually, although not professedly, destroy the nature of sin, is that
   which regards it as the necessary means of the greatest good. Sin, in
   itself; is an evil; relatively, it is a good. The universe is better
   with it than without it. In itself, it is an evil that the smaller
   animals should be devoured by the larger; but as this is necessary to
   prevent the undue development of animal life, and as it ministers to
   the higher forms thereof, it becomes a benevolent arrangement. The
   amputation of a limb is an evil; but if necessary to save life, it is a
   good. Wars are dreadful evils, yet the world is indebted to wars for
   the preservation of civil and religious liberty, for which they are a
   small price. Better have war than lose the liberty wherewith Christ has
   made us free. Thus, if sin be the necessary means of the greatest good,
   it ceases to be an evil, on the whole, and it is perfectly consistent
   with the benevolence of God to permit its occurrence. This has been a
   favorite method of solving the problem of evil in all ages. This is the
   idea which Leibnitz wrought out so elaborately in his "Théodicée." It
   has been adopted by many theologians who do not carry it on to its
   legitimate consequences. Thus Twesten [463] says: "If the world be
   absolutely dependent on the most perfect Being; if it be the work of
   the highest love, power, and wisdom; and if it be constantly controlled
   and governed by God, it must be absolutely perfect." Hence even sin,
   although like pain an evil in itself, must on the whole be a good. It
   is a necessary element in a perfect world. Twesten, therefore, says,
   [464] "If the world, with the sin and misery which it contains,
   produces a greater amount of good, and reveals the divine power and
   love more fully than could otherwise be possible, then the consistency
   of the existence of evil with the universal causality (or government)
   of God is thereby vindicated." The word good in this connection,
   according to the common doctrine of optimists, does not mean moral
   good, but happiness. The principle on which this theory is founded was
   propounded in a posthumous treatise of President Edwards, in which he
   taught that virtue consists in the love of being. This principle was
   adopted and carried out by Drs. Hopkins and Emmons in their systems of
   theology, which for many years had great influence in this country.

   Objections to this Theory.

   Plausible as this theory is, it is liable to many objections.

   1. In the first place, we have no right to limit the infinite God. To
   say that this is the best possible world, is to say that God can make
   nothing greater or better; which, unless the world be infinite, is to
   say that God is finite. It is enough for us to believe that the world
   with its finite results, is what God in his wisdom saw fit to call into
   existence; but that it is the best He could make, is a gratuitous and
   derogatory assumption.

   2. It is unscriptural, and contrary to our moral reason, to make
   happiness the end of creation. The Bible declares the glory of God, an
   infinitely higher end, to be the final cause for which all things
   exist. It is the instinctive judgment of men, that holiness or moral
   excellence is a greater good than happiness. But, on this theory,
   holiness has no value except as a means of producing happiness. This
   cannot be believed, except under a protest from our moral nature. The
   theory in question, therefore, solves the problem of evil by denying
   its existence. Nothing is an evil which tends to the greatest
   happiness. Sin is the necessary means of the greatest good, and
   therefore is not an evil.

   The Doctrine that God cannot prevent Sin in a Moral System.

   The second general method of reconciling the existence of sin with the
   benevolence and holiness of God, is, not to deny that sin, even all
   things considered, is an evil; but to affirm that God cannot prevent
   all sin, or even the present amount of sin, in a moral system. It
   assumes that certainty is inconsistent with free agency. Any kind or
   degree of influence which renders it certain how a free agent will act,
   destroys his liberty in acting. He must always be able to act contrary
   to any degree of influence brought to bear upon him, or he ceases to be
   free. God, therefore, of necessity limits Himself when He creates free
   agents. They are beyond his absolute control. He may argue and
   persuade, but He cannot govern.

   This doctrine that God cannot effectually control the acts of free
   agents without destroying their liberty, is so contrary to the
   Scriptures, that it has never been adopted by any organized portion of
   the Christian Church. Some theologians avail themselves of it for an
   emergency, when treating of this subject, although it is utterly at
   variance with their general scheme. Twesten, for example, who, as we
   have seen, in one place teaches that God voluntarily permits sin as the
   necessary means of the greatest good, in another place [465] says that
   He cannot prevent it in a moral system. "Mit der Freiheit," he says,
   "war die Möglichkeit des Misbrauchs gegeben; ohne jene zu vernichten,
   konnte Gott diesen nicht verhindern." That is, without destroying
   liberty, God cannot prevent its abuse. If this be so, then God cannot
   govern free agents. He cannot secure the accomplishment of his
   purposes, or the fulfilment of his promises. There is no security for
   the triumph of good in the universe. Angels and saints in heaven may
   all sin, and evil become dominant and universal. On this theory, all
   prayer that God would change our own hearts, or the hearts of others,
   becomes irrational. All this is so contrary to the teaching of the
   Bible, which everywhere asserts the sovereignty and supremacy of God,
   declaring that the hearts of men are in his hand, and that He turns
   them as the rivers of water; that He makes his people willing in the
   day of his power, working in them to will and to do, according to his
   good pleasure; it is so inconsistent with the promise to give
   repentance and faith, with the assertion of his power to change the
   heart; it is so incompatible with the hopes and confidence of the
   believer, that God can keep him from falling; and so subversive of the
   idea of God as presented in the Bible and revealed in our nature, that
   the Church has, almost with one accord, preferred to leave the mystery
   of evil unexplained, rather than to seek its solution in a principle
   which undermines the foundation of all religion.

   The Scriptural Doctrine.

   The third method of dealing with this question is to rest satisfied
   with the simple statements of the Bible. The Scriptures teach, (1.)
   That the glory of God is the end to which the promotion of holiness,
   and the production of happiness, and all other ends are subordinate.
   (2.) That, therefore, the self-manifestation of God, the revelation of
   his infinite perfection, being the highest conceivable, or possible
   good, is the ultimate end of all his works in creation, providence, and
   redemption. (3.) As sentient creatures are necessary for the
   manifestation of God's benevolence, so there could be no manifestation
   of his mercy without misery, or of his grace and justice, if there were
   no sin. As the heavens declare the glory of God, so He has devised the
   plan of redemption, "To the intent that now unto the principalities and
   powers in heavenly places, might be known by the Church the manifold
   wisdom of God." (Eph. iii. 10.) The knowledge of God is eternal life.
   It is for creatures the highest good. And the promotion of that
   knowledge, the manifestation of the manifold perfections of the
   infinite God, is the highest end of all his works. This is declared by
   the Apostle to be the end contemplated, both in the punishment of
   sinners and in the salvation of believers. It is an end to which, he
   says, no man can rationally object. "What if God, willing to show his
   wrath (or justice), and to make his power known, endured with much long
   suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: and that He might
   make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which He
   had afore prepared unto glory." (Rom. ix. 22, 23.) Sin, therefore,
   according the Scriptures, is permitted, that the justice of God may be
   known in its punishment, and his grace in its forgiveness. And the
   universe, without the knowledge of these attributes, would be like the
   earth without the light of the sun.

   The glory of God being the great end of all things, we are not obliged
   to assume that this is the best possible world for the production of
   happiness, or even for securing the greatest degree of holiness among
   rational creatures. It is wisely adapted for the end for which it was
   designed, namely, the manifestation of the manifold perfections of God.
   That God, in revealing Himself, does promote the highest good of his
   creatures, consistent with the promotion of his own glory, may be
   admitted. But to reverse this order, to make the good of the creature
   the highest end, is to pervert and subvert the whole scheme; it is to
   put the means for the end, to subordinate God to the universe, the
   Infinite to the finite. This putting the creature in the place of the
   Creator, disturbs our moral and religious sentiments and convictions,
   as well as our intellectual apprehensions of God, and of his relation
   to the universe.

   The older theologians almost unanimously make the glory of God the
   ultimate, and the good of the creature the subordinate end of all
   things. Twesten, indeed, says [466] it makes no difference whether we
   say God proposes his own glory as the ultimate end, and, for that
   purpose, determined to produce the highest degree of good; or that He
   purposed the highest good of his creatures, whence the manifestation of
   his glory flows as a consequence. It, however, makes all the difference
   in the world, whether the Creator be subordinate to the creature, or
   the creature to the Creator; whether the end be the means, or the means
   the end. There is a great difference whether the earth or the sun be
   assumed as the centre of our solar system. If we make the earth the
   centre, our astronomy will be in confusion. And if we make the
   creature, and not God, the end of all things, our theology and religion
   will in like manner be perverted. It may, in conclusion, be safely
   asserted that a universe constructed for the purpose of making God
   known, is a far better universe than one designed for the production of
   happiness.

   § 14. The Truth of God.

   Truth, is a word of frequent occurrence and of wide signification in
   the Bible. The primary meaning of the Greek word aletheia (from a and
   letho) is openness; what is not concealed. But in the Hebrew, and
   therefore in the Bible, the primary idea of truth is, that which
   sustains, which does not fail, or disappoint our expectations. The
   true, therefore, is, (1.) That which is real as opposed to that which
   is fictitious or imaginary. Jehovah is the true God, because He is
   really God, while the gods of the heathen are vanity and nothing, mere
   imaginary beings, having neither existence nor attributes. (2.) The
   true is that which completely comes up to its idea, or to what it
   purports to be. A true man is a man in whom the idea of manhood is
   fully realized. The true God is He in whom is found all that Godhead
   imports. (3.) The true is that in which the reality exactly corresponds
   to the manifestation. God is true, because He really is what He
   declares himself to be; because He is what He commands us to believe
   Him to be; and because all his declarations correspond to what really
   is. (4.) The true is that which can be depended upon, which does not
   fail, or change, or disappoint. In this sense also God is true as He is
   immutable and faithful. His promise cannot fail; his word never
   disappoints. His word abideth forever. When our Lord says, "Thy word is
   truth," He says that all that God has revealed may be confided in as
   exactly corresponding to what really is, or is to be. His word can
   never fail, though heaven and earth pass away.

   The truth of God, therefore, is the foundation of all religion. It is
   the ground of our assurance, that what He has revealed of Himself and
   of his will, in his works and in the Scriptures, may be relied upon. He
   certainly is, and wills, and will do, whatever He has thus made known.
   It is no less the foundation of all knowledge. That our senses do not
   deceive us; that consciousness is trustworthy in what it teaches; that
   anything is what it appears to us to be; that our existence is not a
   delusive dream, has no other foundation than the truth of God. In this
   sense, all knowledge is founded on faith, i.e., the belief that God is
   true.

   The theologians are accustomed to say: (1.) "Veritas Dei in essentia,
   est convenientia omnium eorum, quæ ad naturam perfectissimi pertinent
   eamque totam constituunt; qua ratione Deus verus opponitur fictis et
   commentitiis." (Jer. x. 8, 10, 11; John v. 20, 21.) (2.) "Veritas Dei
   in intellectu, est convenientia cogitationum cum objecto." . . . . (Job
   xi. 7; Acts xv. 18.) (3.) "Veritas Dei in voluntate est convenientia
   decreti ac propositi efficacis cujusque cum rationibus in intellectu
   probe cognitis et judicatis." (Rom. xi. 33.) (4.) "Veritas Dei in
   factis, est convenientia actionum cum proposito." (Ps. xxv. 10) (5.)
   "Veritas Dei in dictis, quæ singulatim vocari solet veracitas, est
   convenientia verborum omnium cum recta cogitatione animique sententia,
   et efficaci voluntatis proposito." (Num. xxiii. 19; 1 Sam. xv. 29; Tit.
   i. 2; Heb. vi. 18.) "Hæc cernitur (a). in doctrinis (Is. xvii. 17);
   (b), in prædictionibus, promissionibus, ut et comminationibus. (Num.
   xxiii. 19.)" [467]

   To the same effect the Reformed theologian Endemann, says, "Veracitas
   Deo duplici sensu recte adscribitur, (1.) Quatenus nunquam errat, quia
   est omniscius, nunquam errorem aliis significat, quia id repugnat
   bonitati ejus. . . . . (2.) Quatenus Deus ea actu sentit, quæ verbis
   vel factis entibus intelligentibus significat. Deus actionibus et
   sermonibus suis eum intendit finem, ut sibi homines credant, confidant,
   etc., quem finem everteret si semel a veritate discederet. Scriptura
   docet idem scil. quod Deus . . . . [est] verax, immunis ab omni errore
   et mendacio. . . . . Fidelis est Deus, quatenus ingenue aliquid
   promittit; atque promissum certissimo complet. . . . . Severitatem Deo
   tribuimus quatenus comminationes suas implet." [468]

   The philosophical theologians virtually deny that there is any such
   attribute in God as truth. They say that what is intended by that term
   is only the uniformity of law. The efficiency of God is always
   exercised in such a way that we may confide in the regular sequence of
   events. In this respect it may be said that God is true. Bruch [469]
   admits "That this idea arises necessarily out of our religious
   consciousness, inasmuch as we embrace with full confidence what we
   regard as a divine revelation, and are persuaded that God in due time
   will fulfil whatever He has purposed, promised, or threatened. This
   confidence is in the strongest terms often expressed in the sacred
   writings, and is the source of the firm faith by which the Christian
   receives the revelation made in Christ; and of the unshaken confidence
   with which he anticipates the fulfillment of the divine promises."
   Nevertheless, although this idea of the truth of God has its foundation
   in our own nature, and is so clearly recognized in Scripture, and
   although it enters so deeply into the religious experience and hopes of
   the believer, it is a delusion. There is no such attribute in God. It
   is unphilosophical, and therefore impossible that there should be the
   distinction, which must then be assumed, between purpose and act in the
   divine mind. The ascription of truth or veracity to God rests, says
   Bruch, "on the assumption of a distinction in Him between thought and
   its manifestation, between his promises and threatenings, and their
   accomplishment, which not only destroys the unity of the divine
   essence, but reduces Him to the limitations and changes of time.
   . . . . As the ascription of veracity to God arises out of what we
   observe in ourselves, it bears the impress of anthropomorphism, and has
   no claim to scientific recognition." [470] He further objects to the
   ascription of truth to God, in the ordinary sense of that term, because
   God works uniformly according to law, and therefore. "properly
   speaking, there can be no such thing as promises or threatenings with
   him." [471] The idea is, that as God has established certain physical
   laws, and if men comply with them they are well, if they violate them,
   they suffer for it; so there are laws which determine the well-being of
   rational creatures: if we observe those laws, we are happy; if we
   disregard them, we are miserable. God has nothing to do with it, except
   as He established those laws and carries them out. The philosophical
   idea, therefore, of the truth of God, is the immutability of law,
   physical and moral. This view is still more definitely presented by
   Schweizer. [472] God from the beginning to the end of the world is one
   and the same causality; this, in reference to the moral world, is his
   truth, veracitas, fidelitas, in so far as the later revelations, or
   manifestations of this causality, correspond to what the earlier
   manifestations would lead us to expect. God, according to this view, is
   not so much a person, as a name for the moral order of the universe.
   There is, of course, some truth in this mode of representation. The
   laws of God, by which He governs his creatures, rational and
   irrational, are uniform. It is true that a man reaps what he sows; that
   he receives here and hereafter the natural consequences of his conduct.
   If he sows to the flesh, he reaps corruption; if he sows to the spirit,
   he reaps life everlasting. But these laws are administered by a
   personal God, who, as He controls physical laws so as to produce plenty
   or famine, health or pestilence, as to Him seems fit, so also He
   controls all the laws which determine the well-being of the souls of
   men, so as to accomplish his designs and to secure the fulfilment of
   his promises and threatenings. The laws of a well-ordered human
   government are uniform and impartial, but that is not inconsistent with
   their human administration.

   It is a great mercy that, at least in some cases, those whose
   philosophy forbids their believing in the personality of God, believe
   in the personality of Christ, whom they regard as a man invested with
   all the attributes of the Godhead, and whom they love and worship
   accordingly.

   § 15. Sovereignty.

   Sovereignty is not a property of the divine nature, but a prerogative
   arising out of the perfections of the Supreme Being. If God be a
   Spirit, and therefore a person, infinite, eternal, and immutable in his
   being and perfections, the Creator and Preserver of the universe, He is
   of right its absolute sovereign. Infinite wisdom, goodness, and power,
   with the right of possession, which belongs to God in all his
   creatures, are the immutable foundation of his dominion. "Our God is in
   the heavens; He hath done whatsoever He pleased." (Ps. cxv. 8.) "All
   the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and He doeth
   according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants
   of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest
   thou?" (Dan. iv. 35.) "All that is in the heaven and in the earth is
   thine." (1 Chron. xxix. 11.) "The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness
   thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein." (Ps. xxiv. 1.) "Thine
   is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all." (1
   Chron. xxix. 11.) "Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the
   father, so also the soul of the son is mine." (Ez. xviii. 4.) "Woe unto
   him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the
   potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioned it,
   What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?" (Is. xlv. 9.) "Is it
   not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?" (Matt. xx. 15.) He
   "worketh all things after the counsel of his own will." (Eph. i. 11.)
   "Of Him, and through Him, and to Him are all things: to whom be glory
   forever. Amen." (Rom. xi. 36.)

   From these and similar passages of Scriptures it is plain, (1.) That
   the sovereignty of God is universal. It extends over all his creatures
   from the highest to the lowest. (2.) That it is absolute. There is no
   limit to be placed to his authority. He doeth his pleasure in the
   armies of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth. (3.) It is
   immutable. It can neither be ignored nor rejected. It binds all
   creatures, as inexorably as physical laws bind the material universe.

   This sovereignty is exercised, (1.) In establishing the laws, physical
   and moral, by which all creatures are to be governed. (2.) In
   determining the nature and powers of the different orders of created
   beings, and in assigning each its appropriate sphere. (3.) In
   appointing to each individual his position and lot. It is the Lord who
   fixes the bounds of our habitation. Our times are in his hands. He
   determines when, where, and under what circumstances each individual of
   our race is to be born, live, and die. Nations, no less than
   individuals, are thus in the hands of God, who assigns them their
   heritage in the earth, and controls their destiny. (4.) God is no less
   sovereign in the distribution of his favours. He does what He wills
   with his own. He gives to some riches, to others, honour; to others,
   health; while others are poor, unknown, or the victims of disease. To
   some, the light of the gospel is sent; others are left in darkness.
   Some are brought through faith unto salvation; others perish in
   unbelief. To the question, Why is this? the only answer is that given
   by our Lord. "Even so, Father, for so it seemeth good in thy sight."

   Although this sovereignty is thus universal and absolute, it is the
   sovereignty of wisdom, holiness, and love. The authority of God is
   limited by nothing out of Himself, but it is controlled, in all its
   manifestations, by his infinite perfections. If a man is free and
   exalted, in proportion as he is governed by enlightened reason and a
   pure conscience, so is he supremely blessed who cheerfully submits to
   be governed by the infinite reason and holiness of God. This
   sovereignty of God is the ground of peace and confidence to all his
   people. They rejoice that the Lord God omnipotent reigneth; that
   neither necessity, nor chance, nor the folly of man, nor the malice of
   Satan controls the sequence of events and all their issues. Infinite
   wisdom, love, and power, belong to Him, our great God and Saviour, into
   whose hands all power in heaven and earth has been committed.

CHAPTER VI.

  The Trinity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Preliminary Remarks.

   THE doctrine of the Trinity is peculiar to the religion of the Bible.
   The Triad of the ancient world is only a philosophical statement of the
   pantheistic theory which underlies all the religion of antiquity. With
   the Hindus, simple, undeveloped, primal being, without consciousness or
   attributes, is called Brahm. This being, as unfolding itself in the
   actual world, is Vishnu; as returning into the abyss of unconscious
   being, it is Shiva. In Buddhism we find essentially the same ideas, in
   a more dualistic form. Buddhism makes more of a distinction between
   God, as the spiritual principle of all things, and nature. The soul of
   man is a part, or an existence-form, of this spiritual essence, whose
   destiny is, that it may be freed from nature and lost in the infinite
   unknown. In Platonism, also, we find a notional Trinity. Simple being
   (to on) has its logos, the complex of its ideas, the reality in all
   that is phenomenal and changing. In all these systems, whether ancient
   or modern, there is a Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis; the Infinite
   becomes finite, and the finite returns to the Infinite. It is obvious,
   therefore, that these trinitarian formulas have no analogy with the
   Scriptural doctrine of the Trinity, and serve neither to explain nor to
   confirm it.

   The design of all the revelations contained in the Word of God is the
   salvation of men. Truth is in order to holiness. God does not make
   known his being and attributes to teach men science, but to bring them
   to the saving knowledge of Himself. The doctrines of the Bible are,
   therefore, intimately connected with religion, or the life of God in
   the soul. They determine the religious experience of believers, and are
   presupposed in that experience. This is specially true of the doctrine
   of the Trinity. It is a great mistake to regard that doctrine as a mere
   speculative or abstract truth, concerning the constitution of the
   Godhead, with which we have no practical concern, or which we are
   required to believe simply because it is revealed. On the contrary, it
   underlies the whole plan of salvation, and determines the character of
   the religion (in the subjective sense of that word) of all true
   Christians. It is the unconscious, or unformed faith, even of those of
   God's people who are unable to understand the term by which it is
   expressed. They all believe in God, the Creator and Preserver against
   whom they have sinned, whose justice they know they cannot satisfy, and
   whose image they cannot restore to their apostate nature. They
   therefore, as of necessity, believe in a divine Redeemer and a divine
   Sanctifier. They have, as it were, the factors of the doctrine of the
   Trinity in their own religious convictions. No mere speculative
   doctrine, especially no doctrine so mysterious and so out of analogy
   with all other objects of human knowledge, as that of the Trinity,
   could ever have held the abiding control over the faith of the Church,
   which this doctrine has maintained. It is not, therefore, by any
   arbitrary decision, nor from any bigoted adherence to hereditary
   beliefs, that the Church has always refused to recognize as Christians
   those who reject this doctrine. This judgment is only the expression of
   the deep conviction that Antitrinitarians must adopt a radically and
   practically different system of religion from that on which the Church
   builds her hopes. It is not too much to say with Meyer, [473] that "the
   Trinity is the point in which all Christian ideas and interests unite;
   at once the beginning and the end of all insight into Christianity."

   This great article of the Christian faith may be regarded under three
   different aspects: (1.) The Biblical form of the doctrine. (2.) The
   ecclesiastical form, or the mode in which the statements of the Bible
   have been explained in the symbols of the Church and the writings of
   theologians. (3.) Its philosophical form, or the attempts which have
   been made to illustrate, or to prove, the doctrine on philosophical
   principles. It is only the doctrine as presented in the Bible, which
   binds the faith and conscience of the people of God.

   § 2. Biblical Form of the Doctrine.

   A. What that Form is.

   The form in which this doctrine lies in the Bible, and in which it
   enters into the faith of the Church universal, includes substantially
   the following particulars.

   1. There is one only living and true God, or divine Being. The religion
   of the Bible stands opposed not only to Atheism, but to all forms of
   polytheism. The Scriptures everywhere assert that Jehovah alone is God.
   (Deut. vi. 4.) "The Lord our God is one Lord." "I am the first, and I
   am the last; and besides me there is no God." (Is. xliv. 6.) "Thou
   believest that there is one God; thou doest well." (James ii. 19.) The
   Decalogue, which is the foundation of the moral and religious code of
   Christianity, as well as of Judaism, has as its first and greatest
   commandment, "Thou shalt have no other God before me." No doctrine,
   therefore, can possibly be true which contradicts this primary truth of
   natural as well as of revealed religion.

   2. In the Bible all divine titles and attributes are ascribed equally
   to the Father, Son, and Spirit. The same divine worship is rendered to
   them. The one is as much the object of adoration, love, confidence, and
   devotion as the other. It is not more evident that the Father is God,
   than that the Son is God; nor is the deity of the Father and Son more
   clearly revealed than that of the Spirit.

   3. The terms Father, Son, and Spirit do not express different relations
   of God to his creatures. They are not analogous to the terms Creator,
   Preserver, and Benefactor, which do express such relations. The
   Scriptural facts are, (a.) The Father says I; the Son says I; the
   Spirit says I. (b.) The Father says Thou to the Son, and the Son says
   Thou to the Father; and in like manner the Father and the Son use the
   pronouns He and Him in reference to the Spirit. (c.) The Father loves
   the Son; the Son loves the Father; the Spirit testifies of the Son. The
   Father, Son, and Spirit are severally subject and object. They act and
   are acted upon, or are the objects of action. Nothing is added to these
   facts when it is said that the Father, Son, and Spirit are distinct
   persons; for a person is an intelligent subject who can say I, who can
   be addressed as Thou, and who can act and can be the object of action.
   The summation of the above facts is expressed in the proposition, The
   one divine. Being subsists in three persons, Father, Son, and Spirit.
   This proposition adds nothing to the facts themselves; for the facts
   are, (1.) That there is one divine Being. (2.) The Father, Son, and
   Spirit are divine. (3.) The Father, Son, and Spirit are, in the sense
   just stated, distinct persons. (4.) Attributes being inseparable from
   substance, the Scriptures, in saying that the Father, Son, and Spirit
   possess the same attributes, say they are the same in substance; and,
   if the same in substance, they are equal in power and glory.

   4. Notwithstanding that the Father, Son, and Spirit are the same in
   substance, and equal in power and glory, it is no less true according
   to the Scriptures, (a.) That the Father is first, the Son second, and
   the Spirit third. (b.) The Son is of the Father (ek theou, the logos,
   eikon, apaugasma, tou theou); and the Spirit is of the Father and of
   the Son. (c.) The Father sends the Son, and the Father and Son send the
   Spirit. (d.) The Father operates through the Son, and the Father and
   Son operate through the Spirit. The converse of these statements is
   never found. The Son is never said to send the Father, nor to operate
   through Him nor is the Spirit ever said to send the Father, or the Son,
   or to operate through them. The facts contained in this paragraph are
   summed up in the proposition: In the Holy Trinity there is a
   subordination of the Persons as to the mode of subsistence and
   operation. This proposition again adds nothing to the facts themselves.

   5. According to the Scriptures, the Father created the world, the Son
   created the world, and the Spirit created the world. The Father
   preserves all things; the Son upholds all things; and the Spirit is the
   source of all life. These facts are expressed by saying that the
   persons of the Trinity concur in all acts ad extra. Nevertheless there
   are some acts which are predominantly referred to the Father, others to
   the Son, and others to the Spirit. The Father creates, elects, and
   calls; the Son redeems; and the Spirit sanctifies. And, on the other
   hand, there are certain acts, or conditions, predicated of one person
   of the Trinity, which are never predicated of either of the others.
   Thus, generation belongs exclusively to the Father, filiation to the
   Son, and procession to the Spirit. This is the form in which the
   doctrine of the Trinity lies in the Bible. The above statement involves
   no philosophical element. It is simply an arrangement of the clearly
   revealed facts bearing on this subject. This is the form in which the
   doctrine has always entered into the faith of the Church, as a part of
   its religious convictions and experience.

   To say that this doctrine is incomprehensible, is to say nothing more
   than must be admitted of any other great truth, whether of revelation
   or of science. To say that it is impossible that the one divine
   substance can subsist in three distinct persons, is certainly
   unreasonable, when, according to that form of philosophy which has been
   the most widely diffused, and the most persistent, everything that
   exists is only one of the innumerable forms in which one and the same
   infinite substance subsists; and when, according to the Realists, who
   once controlled the thinking world, all men are the individualized
   forms of the numerically same substance called generic humanity.

   B. Scriptural Proof of the Doctrine.

   No such doctrine as that of the Trinity can be adequately proved by any
   citation of Scriptural passages. Its constituent elements are brought
   into view, some in one place, and some in another. The unity of the
   Divine Being; the true and equal divinity of the Father, Son, and
   Spirit; their distinct personality; the relation in which they stand
   one to the other, and to the Church and the world, are not presented in
   a doctrinal formula in the Word of God, but the several constituent
   elements of the doctrine are asserted, or assumed, over and over, from
   the beginning to the end of the Bible. It is, therefore, by proving
   these elements separately, that the whole doctrine can be most
   satisfactorily established. All that is here necessary is, a reference
   to the general teachings of Scripture on the subject, and to some few
   passages in which everything essential to the doctrine is included.

   The Progressive Character of Divine Revelation.

   1. The progressive character of divine revelation is recognized in
   relation to all the great doctrines of the Bible. One of the strongest
   arguments for the divine origin of the Scriptures is the organic
   relation of its several parts. They comprise more than sixty books
   written by different men in different ages, and yet they form one
   whole; not by mere external historical relations, nor in virtue of the
   general identity of the subjects of which they treat. but by their
   internal organic development. All that is in a full-grown tree was
   potentially in the seed. All that we find unfolded in the fulness of
   the gospel lies in a rudimental form in the earliest books of the
   Bible. What at first is only obscurely intimated is gradually unfolded
   in subsequent parts of the sacred volume, until the truth is revealed
   in its fulness. This is true of the doctrines of redemption; of the
   person and work of the Messiah, the promised seed of the woman; of the
   nature and office of the Holy Spirit; and of a future state beyond the
   grave. And this is specially true of the doctrine of the Trinity. Even
   in the book of Genesis there are intimations of the doctrine which
   receive their true interpretation in later revelations. That the names
   of God are in the plural form; that the personal pronouns are often in
   the first person plural ("Let us make man in our image"); that the form
   of benediction is threefold, and other facts of like nature, may be
   explained in different ways. But when it becomes plain, from the
   progress of the revelation, that there are three persons in the
   Godhead, then such forms of expression can hardly fail to be recognized
   as having their foundation in that great truth.

   2. Much more important, however, is the fact, that not only in Genesis,
   but also in all the early books of Scripture, we find a distinction
   made between Jehovah and the angel of Jehovah, who himself is God, to
   whom all divine titles are given, and divine worship is rendered. As
   the revelation is unfolded, such distinction becomes more and more
   manifest. This messenger of God it called the word, the wisdom, the Son
   of God. His personality and divinity are clearly revealed. He is of
   old, even from everlasting, the Mighty God, the Adonai, the Lord of
   David, Jehovah our Righteousness, who was to be born of a virgin, and
   bear the sins of many.

   3. In like manner, even in the first chapter of Genesis, the Spirit of
   God is represented as the source of all intelligence, order, and life
   in the created universe; and in the following books of the Old
   Testament He is represented as inspiring the prophets, giving wisdom,
   strength, and goodness to statesmen and warriors, and to the people of
   God. This Spirit is not an agency, but an agent, who teaches and
   selects; who can be sinned against and grieved; and who, in the New
   Testament, is unmistakably revealed as a distinct person. When John the
   Baptist appeared, we find him speaking of the Holy Spirit as of a
   person with whom his countrymen were familiar, as an object of divine
   worship and the giver of saving blessings. Our divine Lord also takes
   this truth for granted, and promised to send the Spirit, as a
   Paraclete, to take his place; to instruct, comfort, and strengthen
   them, whom they were to receive and obey. Thus, without any violent
   transition, the earliest revelations of this mystery were gradually
   unfolded, until the Triune God, Father, Son, and Spirit, appears in the
   New Testament as the universally recognized God of all believers.

   The Formula of Baptism.

   4. In the formulas of Baptism and of the Apostolic Benediction,
   provision was made to keep this doctrine constantly before the minds of
   the people, as a cardinal article of the Christian faith. Every
   Christian is baptized in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the
   Holy Ghost. The personality, the divinity, and consequently the
   equality of these three subjects, are here taken for granted. The
   association of the Son and Spirit with the Father, the identity of
   relation, so far as dependence and obedience are concerned, which we
   sustain to the Father, Son, and Spirit respectively; the confession and
   profession involved in the ordinances; all forbid any other
   interpretation of this formula than that which it has always received
   in the Church. If the expression, "In the name of the Father," implies
   the personality of the Father, the same implication is involved when it
   is used in reference to the Son and Spirit. If we acknowledge our
   subjection and allegiance to the one, we acknowledge the same
   subjection and allegiance to the other divine persons here named.

   The Apostolic Benediction.

   In the apostolic benediction a prayer is addressed to Christ for his
   grace, to the Father for his love, and to the Spirit for his
   fellowship. The personality and divinity of each are therefore solemnly
   recognized every time that this benediction is pronounced and received.

   5. In the record of our Lord's baptism, the Father addresses the Son,
   and the Spirit descends in the form of a dove. In the discourse of
   Christ, recorded in the 14th, 15th, and 16th chapters of John's Gospel,
   our Lord speaks to and of the Father, and promises to send the Spirit
   to teach, guide, and comfort his disciples. In that discourse the
   personality and divinity of the Father, Son, and Spirit are recognized
   with equal clearness. In 1 Cor. xii. 4-6, the Apostle speaks of
   diversity of gifts, but the same Spirit; of diversity of
   administration, but the same Lord; and of diversities of operations,
   but the same God.

   It is not to be forgotten, however, that the faith of the Church in the
   doctrine of the Trinity, does not rest exclusively or principally on
   such arguments as those mentioned above. The great foundation of that
   faith is what is taught everywhere in the Bible of the unity of the
   Divine Being; of the personality and divinity of the Father, Son, and
   Spirit; and of their mutual relations.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 3. The Transition Period.

   A. The Necessity for a more Definite Statement of the Doctrine.

   The Biblical form of the doctrine of the Trinity, as given above,
   includes everything that is essential to the integrity of the doctrine,
   and all that is embraced in the faith of ordinary Christians. It is not
   all, however, that is included in the creeds of the Church. It is
   characteristic of the Scriptures, that the truths therein presented are
   exhibited in the form in which they address themselves to our religious
   consciousness. To this feature of the Word of God, its adaptation to
   general use is to be attributed. A truth often lies in the mind of the
   Church as an object of faith, long before it is wrought cut in its
   doctrinal form; that is, before it is analyzed, its contents clearly
   ascertained, and its elements stated in due relation to each other.
   When a doctrine so complex as that of the Trinity is presented as an
   object of faith, the mind is forced to reflect upon it, to endeavour to
   ascertain what it includes, and how its several parts are to be stated,
   so as to avoid confusion or contradiction. Besides this internal
   necessity for a definite statement of the doctrine, such statement was
   forced upon the Church from without. Even among those who honestly
   intended to receive what the Scriptures taught upon the subject, it was
   inevitable that there should arise diversity in the mode of statement,
   and confusion and contradiction in the use of terms. As the Church is
   one, not externally merely, but really and inwardly, this diversity and
   confusion are as much an evil, a pain, and an embarrassment, troubling
   its inward peace, as the like inconsistency and confusion would be in
   an individual mind. There was, therefore, an inward and outward
   necessity, in the Church itself, for a clear, comprehensive, and
   consistent statement of the various elements of this complex doctrine
   of Christian faith.

   B. Conflict with Error.

   Besides this necessity for such a statement of the doctrine as would
   satisfy the minds of those who received it, there was a further
   necessity of guarding the truth from the evil influence of false or
   erroneous exhibitions of it. The conviction was deeply settled in the
   minds of all Christians that Christ is a divine person. The glory which
   He displayed, the authority which He assumed, the power which He
   exhibited, the benefits which He conferred, necessitated the
   recognition of Him as the true God. No less strong, however, was the
   conviction that there is only one God. The difficulty was, to reconcile
   these two fundamental articles of the Christian faith. The mode of
   solving this difficulty, by rejecting one of these articles to save the
   other, was repudiated by common consent. There were those who denied
   the divinity of Christ, and endeavoured to satisfy the minds of
   believers by representing Him as the best of men; as filled with the
   Spirit of God; as the Son of God, because miraculously begotten; or as
   animated and controlled by the power of God: but, nevertheless, merely
   a man. This view of the person of Christ was so universally rejected in
   the early Church, as hardly to occasion controversy. The errors with
   which the advocates of the doctrine of the Trinity had to contend were
   of a higher order. It was of course unavoidable that both parties, the
   advocates and the opponents of the doctrine, availed themselves of the
   current philosophies of the age. Consciously or unconsciously, all men
   are more or less controlled in their modes of thinking on divine
   subjects by the metaphysical opinions which prevail around them, and in
   which they have been educated. We accordingly find that Gnosticism and
   Platonism coloured the views of both the advocates and the opponents of
   the doctrine of the Trinity during the Ante-Nicene period.

   The Gnostics.

   The Gnostics held that there was a series of emanations from the primal
   Being, of different orders or ranks. It was natural that those addicted
   to this system, and who professed to be Christians, should represent
   Christ as one of the highest of these emanations, or Eons. This view of
   his person admitted of his being regarded as consubstantial with God,
   as divine, as the creator of the world, as a distinct person, and of
   his having at least an apparent or docetic union with humanity. It
   therefore suited some of the conditions of the complicated problem to
   be solved. It, however, represented Christ as one of a series of
   emanations, and reduced Him to the category of dependent beings,
   exalted above others of the same class in rank, but not in nature. It
   moreover involved the denial of his true humanity, which was as
   essential to the faith of the Church, and as dear to his people as his
   divinity. All explanations of the Trinity, therefore, founded on the
   Gnostic philosophy were rejected as unsatisfactory and heretical.

   The Platonizers.

   The Platonic system as modified by Philo, and applied by him to the
   philosophical explanation of the theology of the Old Testament, had far
   more influence on the speculations of the early Fathers than
   Gnosticism. According to Plato, God formed, or had in the divine
   reason, the ideas, types, or models of all things, which ideas became
   the living, formative principles of all actual existences. The divine
   reason, with its contents, was the Logos. Philo, therefore, in
   explaining creation, represents the Logos as the sum of all these types
   or ideas, which make up the kosmos noetos, or ideal world. In this view
   the Logos was designated as endiathetos (mente conceptus). In creation,
   or the self-manifestation of God in nature, this divine reason or Logos
   is born, sent forth, or or projected; becoming the logos prophorikos,
   giving life and form to all things. God, as thus manifested in the
   world, Philo called not only logos, but also uios, eikon, huios
   monogenes, protogonos, skia, paradeigma, doxa, episteme, theou, and
   deuteros Theos. In the application of this philosophy to the doctrine
   of Christ, it was easy to make him the logos prophorikos, to assume and
   assert his personality, and to represent him as specially manifested or
   incarnate in Jesus of Nazareth. This attempt was made by Justin Martyr,
   Tatian, and Theophilus. It succeeded so far as it exalted Christ above
   all creatures; it made him the creator and preserver of all things, the
   light and life of the world. It did not satisfy the consciousness of
   the Church, because it represented the divinity of Christ as
   essentially subordinate; it made his generation antemundane, but not
   eternal; and especially because the philosophy, from which this theory
   of the Logos was borrowed, was utterly opposed to the Christian system.
   The Logos of Plato and Philo was only a collective term for the ideal
   world, the idea ton ideon; and therefore the real distinction between
   God and the Logos, was that between God as hidden and God as revealed.
   God in himself was ho theos; God in nature was the Logos. This is,
   after all, the old heathen, pantheistic doctrine, which makes the
   universe the manifestation, or existence form of God.

   Origen's Doctrine.

   Origen presented the Platonic doctrine of the generation and nature of
   the Logos in a higher form than that in which it had been exhibited in
   the speculations of others among the fathers. He not only insisted, in
   opposition to the Monarchians or Unitarians, upon the distinct
   personality of the Son, but also upon his eternal, as opposed to his
   antemundane, generation. Nevertheless, he referred this generation to
   the will of the Father. The Son was thus reduced to the category of
   creatures, for according to Origen, creation is from eternity. Another
   unsatisfactory feature of all these speculations on the Logos-theory
   was, that it made no provision for the Holy Spirit. The Logos was the
   Word, or Son of God, begotten before creation in order to create, or,
   according to Origen, begotten from eternity; but what was the Holy
   Spirit? He appears in the baptismal service and in the apostolic
   benediction as a distinct person, but the Logos-theory provided only
   for a Dyad, and not a Triad. Hence the greatest confusion appears in
   the utterances of this class of writers concerning the Holy Ghost.
   Sometimes, He is identified with the Logos; sometimes, He is
   represented as the substance common to the Father and the Son;
   sometimes, as the mere power or efficiency of God; sometimes, as a
   distinct person subordinate to the Logos, and a creature.

   The Sabellian Theory.

   Another method of solving this great problem and of satisfying the
   religious convictions of the Church, was that adopted by the
   Monarchians, Patripassians, or Unitarians, as they were indifferently
   called. They admitted a modal trinity. They acknowledged the true
   divinity of Christ, but denied any personal distinctions in the
   Godhead. The same person is at once Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; these
   terms expressing the different relations in which God reveals Himself
   in the world and in the Church. Praxeas, of Asia Minor, who taught this
   doctrine in Rome, A.D. 200; Noetus, of Smyrna, A.D. 230; Beryll, bishop
   of Bostra, in Arabia, A.D. 250; and especially Sabellius, a presbyter
   of Ptolemais, A.D. 250, after whom this doctrine was called
   Sabellianism, were the principal advocates of this theory. The only
   point as to which this doctrine satisfied the religious convictions of
   Christians, was the true divinity of our Lord. But as it denied the
   distinct personality of the Father and of the Spirit, to whom every
   believer felt himself to stand in a personal relation, to whom worship
   and prayers were addressed, it could not be received by the people of
   God. Its opposition to Scripture was apparent. In the Bible the Father
   is represented as constantly addressing the Son as "Thou," as loving
   Him, as sending Him, as rewarding and exalting Him; and the Son as
   constantly addresses the Father and refers everything to his will, so
   that their distinct personality is one of the most clearly revealed
   doctrines of the Word of God. Sabellianism was, therefore, soon almost
   universally rejected.

   Arianism.

   Although Origen had insisted on the distinct personality of the Son,
   and upon his eternal generation, and although he freely called him God,
   nevertheless he would not admit his equality with God. The Father,
   alone, according to him was hi theos, the Son was simply theos. The Son
   was theos ek theou and not auto-theos. And this subordination was not
   simply as to the mode of subsistence and operation, but as to nature;
   for Origen taught that the Son was of a different essence from the
   Father, heteros kat' ousian, and owed his existence to the will of the
   Father. His disciples carried out his doctrine and avowedly made Christ
   a creature. This was done by Dionysius of Alexandria, a scholar of
   Origen, who spoke of the Son as poiema and ktisma, a mode of
   representation, however, which he subsequently retracted or explained
   away. It is plain, however, that the principles of Origen were
   inconsistent with the true divinity of Christ. It was not long,
   therefore, before Arius, another presbyter of Alexandria, openly
   maintained that the Son was not eternal, but was posterior to the
   Father; that He was created not from the substance of God, but ek ouk
   onton, and therefore was not homoousios with the Father. He admitted
   that the Son existed before any other creature, and that it was by Him
   God created the world.

   It is to be constantly remembered that these speculations were the
   business of the theologians. They neither expressed nor affected to
   express the mind of the Church. The great body of the people drew their
   faith, then, as now, immediately from the Scriptures and from the
   services of the sanctuary. They were baptized in the name of the
   Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. They addressed
   themselves to the Father as the creator of heaven and earth, and as
   their reconciled God and Father, and to Jesus Christ as their Redeemer,
   and to the Holy Ghost as their sanctifier and comforter. They loved,
   worshipped, and trusted the one as they did the others. This was the
   religious belief of the Church, which remained undisturbed by the
   speculations and controversies of the theologians, in their attempts to
   vindicate and explain the common faith. This state of confusion was,
   however, a great evil, and in order to bring the Church to an agreement
   as to the manner in which this fundamental doctrine of Christianity
   should be stated, the Emperor Constantine summoned the First Ecumenical
   Council, to meet at Nice, in Nicomedia, A.D. 325.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 4. The Church Doctrine as presented by the Council of Nice.

   A. The Objects for which that Council was convened.

   The object for which the Council was called together was three-fold.
   (1.) To remedy the confusion which prevailed in the use of several
   important words employed in discussions on the doctrine of the Trinity.
   (2.) To condemn errors which had been adopted in different parts of the
   Church. (3.) To frame such a statement of the doctrine as would include
   all its Scriptural elements, and satisfy the religious convictions of
   the mass of believers. This was an exceedingly difficult task.

   1. Because the usus loquendi of certain important terms was not then
   determined. The word hupostasis, for example, was used in two opposite
   senses. It was often taken, in its etymological sense, for substance,
   and is used by the Council itself as synonymous with ousia. But it had
   already begun to be used in the sense of person. As it expresses
   reality, as opposed to what is phenomenal or apparent, or mode of
   manifestation, it came to be universally used in the Greek Church, in
   the latter sense, as a safeguard against the idea of a mere modal
   Trinity. It will be admitted that great confusion must prevail, if one
   man should say there is only one hupostasis in the Godhead, and another
   affirm that there are three, when both meant the same thing, the one
   using the word in the sense of substance, and the other in that of
   person.

   In the Latin Church the same difficulty was experienced in the use of
   the words substantia and subsistentia. These words were often
   interchanged as equivalent, and both were used, sometimes in the sense
   of substance, and sometimes in that of suppositum. Usage finally
   determined the former to mean substance or essence, and the latter a
   mode in which substance exists, i.e., suppositum. According to
   established usage, therefore, there is one substance, and there are
   three subsistences in the Godhead.

   To express the idea of a suppositum intelligens, or self-conscious
   agent, the Greeks first used the word prosopon. But as that word
   properly means the face, the aspect, and as it was used by the
   Sabellians to express their doctrine of the threefold aspect under
   which the Godhead was revealed, it was rejected, and the word
   hupostasis adopted. The Latin word persona (from per and sono) properly
   means a mask worn by an actor and through which he spoke; and then the
   role or character which the actor sustained. On this account the word
   had a struggle before it was adopted in the terminology of theology.

   The celebrated term homoousios, so long the subject of controversy, was
   not free from ambiguity. It expressed plainly enough sameness of
   substance, but whether that sameness was specific or numerical, the
   usage of the word left undecided. Porphyry is quoted as saying, that
   the souls of men and of irrational animals are homoousioi, and
   Aristotle as saying that the stars are homoousioi, and men and brutes
   are said to be homoousioi as to their bodies; and in like manner
   angels, demons, and human souls, are said to be all homoousioi. In this
   sense, Peter, James, and John are homoousioi, as having the same nature
   in kind. On this account the use of the word was objected to, as
   admitting of a Tritheistic interpretation. The Council, however,
   determined the sense in which it was to be understood in their
   decisions, by saying that the Son was begotten ek tes housias tou
   patros, and by denying that He was created. As God is a spirit, and as
   we are spirits, we are said, in Scripture, to be like Him, and to be
   his children, to be of the same nature. But with regard to the Son it
   was declared that He was of the same numerical essence with the Father;
   He is truly God, possessing the same attributes and entitled to the
   same homage. Thus explained, the word became an insuperable barrier
   against the adoption of the Nicene Creed by any who denied the true
   divinity of the Son of God.

   Difference of Opinion among the Members of the Council.

   2. A second difficulty with which the Council had to contend was
   diversity of opinion among its own members. All the conflicting views
   which had agitated the Church were there represented. The principal
   parties were, first, the Arians, who held, (1.) That the Son owed his
   existence to the will of the Father. (2.) That He was not eternal; but
   that there was a time when He was not. (3.) That He was created ex ouk
   onton, out of nothing, and was therefore ktisma kai poiema. (4.) That
   He was not immutable, but treptos phusei. (5.) That his preëminence
   consisted in the fact that He alone was created immediately by God,
   whereas all other creatures were created by the Son. (6.) He was not
   God of Himself, but was made God, etheopoiethe; that is, on account of
   his exalted nature, and the relation in which He stands to all other
   creatures, as Creator and Governor, He was entitled to divine worship.

   One of the passages of Scripture on which the Arians principally relied
   was Prov. viii. 22, which in the Septuagint is rendered: ektise me
   archen hodon autou (He created me in the beginning of his ways). As
   Wisdom, there spoken of, was universally understood to be the Logos,
   and as the Septuagint was regarded as authoritative, this passage
   seemed to prove, beyond dispute, that the Logos or Son was created. The
   Orthodox were forced to explain away this passage by saying that
   ktizein was here to be taken in the sense of gennan, the word elsewhere
   used to express the relation between the Father and the Son. Ignorance,
   or neglect of the Hebrew, prevented their answering the argument of the
   Arians by showing that the word qnh, here rendered by the Septuagint
   ektise, means not only to establish, but to possess. The Vulgate,
   therefore, correetly renders the passage, "Dominus possidet me;" and
   the English version also reads, "The Lord possessed me." The Arians
   proper constituted a small minority of the Council.

   The Semi-Arians.

   The second party included the Semi-Arians and the disciples of Origen.
   These held with the Arians, (1.) That the Son owed his existence to the
   will of the Father. (2.) That He was not of the same essence, but
   heteros kat' ousian. They seemed to hold that there was an essence
   intermediate between the divine substance and created substances. It
   was in reference to this form of opinion that Augustine afterwards
   said, [474] "Unde liquido apparet ipsum factum non esse per quem facta
   sunt omnia. Et si factus non est, creatura non est: si autem creatura
   non est, ejusdem cum Patre substantiæ est. Omnis enim substantia quæ
   Deus non est, creatura est; et quæ creatura non est, Deus est."

   (3) The Son was, therefore, subordinate to the Father, not merely in
   rank or mode of subsistence, but in nature. He belonged to a different
   order of beings. He was not autotheos, ho Theos, or ho alethinos theos;
   but simply theos, a term which, according to Origen, could be properly
   applied to the higher orders of intelligent creatures.

   (4.) The Son, although thus inferior to the Father, having life in
   Himself, was the source of life, i.e., the Creator.

   (5.) The Holy Spirit, according to most of the Arians and to Origen,
   was created by the Son, -- the first and highest of the creatures
   called into being by his power.

   The Orthodox.

   The third party in the Council were the Orthodox, who constituted the
   great majority. All Christians were the worshippers of Christ. He was
   to them the object of supreme love and the ground of their confidence;
   to Him they were subject in heart and life. They looked to Him for
   everything. He was their God in the highest sense of the word. He was,
   moreover, in their apprehension, a distinct person, and not merely
   another name for the Father. But as the conviction was no less deeply
   rooted in the minds of Christians, that there is only one God or divine
   Being, the problem which the Council had to solve was to harmonize
   these apparently incompatible convictions, namely, that there is only
   one God, and yet that the Father is God, and the Son, as a distinct
   person, is God, the same in substance and equal in power and glory. The
   only thing to be done was, to preserve the essential elements of the
   doctrine, and yet not make the statement of it self-contradictory. To
   meet these conditions, the Council framed the following Creed, namely,
   "We believe in one God, the Father almighty, the maker of all things
   visible and invisible; and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
   only begotten, begotten of the Father, that is, of the essence of the
   Father, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten and
   not made, consubstantial with the Father, by whom all things were made
   whether in heaven or on earth; who for us men and our salvation came
   down from heaven; and was incarnate and became man, suffered and rose
   again on the third day; ascended into heaven, and will come to judge
   the living and the dead. And we believe in the Holy Ghost. But those
   who say, that there was a time when He (the Son) was not, that He was
   not before He was made, or was made out of nothing, or of another or
   different essence or substance, that He was a creature, or mutable, or
   susceptible of change, the Holy Catholic Church anathematizes."

   B. Council of Constantinople.
   The so-called Athanasian Creed.

   The most obvious deficiency in the Nicene Creed is the omission of any
   definite statement concerning the Holy Spirit. This is to be accounted
   for by the fact that the doctrine concerning the Son, and his relation
   to the Father, was then the absorbing subject of controversy.
   Athanasius, however, and other expounders and defenders of the Nicene
   Creed, insisted that the Spirit is consubstantial with the Father and
   the Son, and that such was the mind of the Council. As this, however,
   was disputed, it was distinctly asserted in several provincial
   Councils, as in that of Alexandria, A.D. 362, and that of Rome, A.D.
   375. It was opposition to this doctrine which led to the calling of the
   Second Ecumenical Council, which met in Constantinople, A.D. 381. In
   the modification of the Nicene Creed, as issued by that Council, the
   following words were added to the clause, "We believe in the Holy
   Ghost," namely: "Who is the Lord and giver of life, who proceedeth from
   the Father, who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and
   glorified, who spoke by the prophets." Some of the Greek and the great
   body of the Latin fathers held that the Spirit proceeded from the Son
   as well as from the Father, and by the Synod of Toledo, A.D. 589, the
   words filioque were added to the creed. This addition was one of the
   causes which led to the separation of the Eastern and Western Churches.

   The Athanasian Creed.

   After the Council of Constantinople, A.D. 381, the controversies which
   agitated the Church had reference to the constitution of the person of
   Christ. Before the questions involved in those controversies were
   authoritatively decided, the so-called Athanasian Creed, an
   amplification of those of Nice and of Constantinople came to be
   generally adopted, at least, among the Western Churches. That creed was
   in these words, namely: "Whoever would be saved, must first of all take
   care that he hold the Catholic faith, which, except a man preserve
   whole and inviolate, he shall without doubt perish eternally. But this
   is the Catholic faith, that we worship one God in trinity, and trinity
   in unity. Neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance.
   For the person of the Father is one; of the Son, another; of the Holy
   Spirit, another. But the divinity of the Father, and of the Son, and of
   the Holy Spirit, is one, the glory equal, the majesty equal. Such as is
   the Father, such also is the Son, and such the Holy Spirit. The Father
   is uncreated, the Son is uncreated, the Holy Spirit is uncreated. The
   Father is infinite, the Son is infinite, the Holy Spirit is infinite.
   The Father is eternal, the Son is eternal, the Holy Spirit is eternal.
   And yet there are not three eternal Beings, but one eternal Being. As
   also there are not three uncreated Beings, nor three infinite Beings,
   but one uncreated and one infinite Being. In like manner, the Father is
   omnipotent, the Son is omnipotent, and the Holy Spirit is omnipotent.
   And yet, there are not three omnipotent Beings, but one omnipotent
   Being. Thus the Father is God, the Son, God, and the Holy Spirit, God.
   And yet there are not three Gods, but one God only. The Father is Lord,
   the Son, Lord, and the Holy Spirit, Lord. And yet there are not three
   Lords, but one Lord only. For as we are compelled by Christian truth to
   confess each person distinctively to be both God and Lord, we are
   prohibited by the Catholic religion to say that there are three Gods,
   or three Lords. The Father is made by none, nor created, nor begotten.
   The Son is from the Father alone, not made, not created, but begotten.
   The Holy Spirit is not created by the Father and the Son, nor begotten,
   but proceeds. Therefore, there is one Father, not three Fathers; one
   Son, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits. And in
   this Trinity there is nothing prior or posterior, nothing greater or
   less, but all three persons are coeternal, and coequal to themselves.
   So that through all, as was said above, both unity in trinity, and
   trinity in unity is to be adored. Whoever would be saved, let him thus
   think concerning the Trinity."

   It is universally agreed that Athanasius was not the author of this
   creed. It appears only in the Latin language in its original form; and
   it has modes of expression borrowed from the writings of Augustine, and
   of Vincent of Lerins. A.D. 434. As it also contains allusions to
   subsequent controversies concerning the person of Christ, it is
   naturally referred to some period between the middle of the fifth and
   the middle of the sixth centuries. Although not issued with the
   authority of any Council, it was soon universally admitted in the West,
   and subsequently in the East, and was everywhere regarded as an
   ecumenical symbol.

   The Doctrine of the Trinity as set forth in these three ancient creeds,
   -- the Nicene, the Constantinopolitan, and Athanasian (so-called), --
   is the Church Form of that fundamental article of the Christian faith.
   There is no difference, except as to amplification, between these
   several formulas.

   § 5. Points decided by these Councils.

   A. Against Sabellianism.

   These Councils decided that the terms Father, Son, and Spirit, were not
   expressive merely of relations ad extra, analogous to the terms,
   Creator, Preserver, and Benefactor. This was the doctrine known as
   Sabellianism, which assumed that the Supreme Being is not only one in
   essence, but one in person. The Church doctrine asserts that Father,
   Son, and Spirit express internal, necessary, and eternal relations in
   the Godhead; that they are personal designations, so that the Father is
   one person, the Son another person, and the Spirit another person. They
   differ not as allo kai allo, but as allos kai allos; each says I, and
   each says Thou, to either of the others. The word used in the Greek
   Church to express this fact was first prosopon, and afterwards, and by
   general consent hupostasis; in the Latin Church, "persona," and in
   English, person. The idea expressed by the word in its application to
   the distinctions in the Godhead, is just as clear and definite as in
   its application to men.

   B. Against the Arians and Semi-Arians.

   The Councils held that the Father, Son, and Spirit are the same in
   substance, and equal in power and glory. Whatever divine perfection,
   whether eternity, immutability, infinity, omnipotence, or holiness,
   justice, goodness, or truth, can be predicated of the one, can in the
   same sense and measure be predicated of the others. These attributes
   belonging to the divine essence, and that essence being common to the
   three persons, the attributes or perfections are in like manner common
   to each. It is not the Father as such, nor the Son as such, who is
   self-existent, infinite, and eternal, but the Godhead, or divine
   essence, which subsists in the three persons. The Greek words used to
   express that which was common to the three persons of the Trinity were,
   as we have seen, ousia, phusis, and at first, hupostasis; to which
   correspond the Latin words substantia, or essentia, and natura; and the
   English, substance, essence, and nature. The word selected by the
   Nicene fathers to express the idea of community of substance, was,
   homoousios. But this word, as we have already seen, may express either
   specific sameness, or numerical identity. In the former sense, all
   spirits, whether God, angels, or men, are homoousioi. They are similar
   in essence, i.e., they are rational intelligences. That the Council
   intended the word to be taken in the latter sense, as expressing
   numerical identity, is plain, (1.) Because in its wider sense
   homoousios does not differ from homoiousios, which word the Council
   refused to adopt. The Arians were willing to admit that the Father,
   Son, and Spirit were homoiousioi, but refused to admit that they were
   homoousioi. This proves that the words were used in radically different
   senses. (2.) Because this Council declares that the Son was eternal;
   that He was not created or made, but begotten ek tes ousias tou patros,
   "of the very essence of the Father." (3.) This is implied in the
   explanation of "eternal generation" universally adopted by the Nicene
   fathers, as "the eternal communication of the same numerical essence
   whole and entire, from the Father to the Son." (4.) If the term
   homoousios be taken in the sense of specific sameness, then the Nicene
   Creed teaches Tritheism. The Father, Son, and Spirit are three Gods in
   the same sense that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are three men, for all
   men in that sense of the term are homoousioi. It is the clear doctrine
   of these Councils that the same numerical, infinite, indivisible
   essence subsists in the three persons of the Trinity. This is still
   further evident from the inadequate illustrations of this great mystery
   which the early fathers sought for in nature; as of the light, heat,
   and splendor of the sun; the fountain and its streams; and especially
   from memory, intelligence, and will in man. In all these illustrations,
   however inadequate, the point of analogy was unity (numerical identity)
   of essence with triplicity.

   C. The Mutual Relation of the Persons of the Trinity.

   On this subject the Nicene doctrine includes, --

   1. The principle of the subordination of the Son to the Father, and of
   the Spirit to the Father and the Son. But this subordination does not
   imply inferiority. For as the same divine essence with all its infinite
   perfections is common to the Father, Son, and Spirit, there can be no
   inferiority of one person to the other in the Trinity. Neither does it
   imply posteriority; for the divine essence common to the several
   persons is self-existent and eternal. The subordination intended is
   only that which concerns the mode of subsistence and operation, implied
   in the Scriptural facts that the Son is of the Father, and the Spirit
   is of the Father and the Son, and that the Father operates through the
   Son, and the Father and the Son through the Spirit.

   2. The several persons of the Trinity are distinguished by a certain
   "property," as it is called, or characteristic. That characteristic is
   expressed by their distinctive appellations. The first person is
   characterized as Father, in his relation to the second person; the
   second is characterized as Son, in relation to the first person; and
   the third as Spirit, in relation to the first and second persons.
   Paternity, therefore, is the distinguishing property of the Father;
   filiation of the Son; and procession of the Spirit. It will be observed
   that no attempt at explanation of these relations is given in these
   ecumenical creeds, namely, the Nicene, that of Constantinople, and the
   Athanasian. The mere facts as revealed in Scripture are affirmed.

   3. The third point decided concerning the relation of the persons of
   the Trinity, one to the other, relates to their union. As the essence
   of the Godhead is common to the several persons, they have a common
   intelligence, will, and power. There are not in God three
   intelligences, three wills, three efficiencies. The Three are one God,
   and therefore have one mind and will. This intimate union was expressed
   in the Greek Church by the word perichoresis, which the Latin words
   inexistentia, inhabitatio, and intercommunio, were used to explain.
   These terms were intended to express the Scriptural facts that the Son
   is in the Father, and the Father in the Son; that where the Father is,
   there the Son and Spirit are; that what the one does the others do (the
   Father creates, the Son creates, the Spirit creates), or, as our Lord
   expresses it, "What things soever" the Father "doeth, these also doeth
   the Son likewise." (John v. 19.) So also what the one knows, the others
   know. "The Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
   For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which
   is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of
   God." (1 Cor. ii. 10, 11.) A common knowledge implies a common
   consciousness. In man the soul and body are distinct, yet, while
   united, they have a common life. We distinguish between acts of the
   intellect, and acts of the will, and yet in every act of the will there
   is an exercise of the intelligence; as in every act of the affections
   there is a joint action of the intelligence and will. These are not
   illustrations of the relations of the persons of the Trinity, which are
   ineffable, but of the fact that in other and entirely different spheres
   there is this community of life in different subsistences, -- different
   subsistences, at least so far as the body and soul are concerned.

   This fact -- of the intimate union, communion, and inhabitation of the
   persons of the Trinity -- is the reason why everywhere in Scripture,
   and instinctively by all Christians, God as God is addressed as a
   person, in perfect consistency with the Tripersonality of the Godhead.
   We can, and do pray to each of the Persons separately; and we pray to
   God as God; for the three persons are one God; one not only in
   substance, but in knowledge, will, and power. To expect that we, who
   cannot understand anything, not even ourselves, should understand these
   mysteries of the Godhead, is to the last degree unreasonable. But as in
   every other sphere we must believe what we cannot understand; so we may
   believe all that God has revealed in his Word concerning Himself,
   although we cannot understand the Almighty unto perfection.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 6. Examination of the Nicene Doctrine.

   A. Subordination.

   A distinction must be made between the Nicene Creed (as amplified in
   that of Constantinople) and the doctrine of the Nicene fathers. The
   creeds are nothing more than a well-ordered arrangement of the facts of
   Scripture which concern the doctrine of the Trinity. They assert the
   distinct personality of the Father, Son, and Spirit; their mutual
   relation as expressed by those terms; their absolute unity as to
   substance or essence, and their consequent perfect equality; and the
   subordination of the Son to the Father, and of the Spirit to the Father
   and the Son, as to the mode of subsistence and operation. These are
   Scriptural facts, to which the creeds in question add nothing; and it
   is in this sense they have been accepted by the Church universal.

   But the Nicene fathers did undertake, to a greater or less degree, to
   explain these facts. These explanations relate principally to the
   subordination of the Son and Spirit to the Father, and to what is meant
   by generation, or the relation between the Father and the Son. These
   two points are so intimately related that they cannot be considered
   separately. Yet as the former is more comprehensive than the latter, it
   may be expedient to speak of them in order, although what belongs to
   the one head, in a good degree belongs also to the other.

   The ambiguity of the word homoousios has already been remarked upon. As
   ousia, a may mean generic nature common to many individuals, not unum
   in numero, but ens unum in multis, so homoousios (consubstantial) may
   mean nothing more than sameness of species or kind. It is therefore
   said, that "the term homoousion, in its strict grammatical sense
   differs from monoousion or toutoousion, as well as from heteroousion,
   and signifies not numerical identity, but equality of essence or
   community of nature among several beings." [475] "The Nicene Creed,"
   Dr. Schaff adds, "does not expressly assert the singleness or numerical
   unity of the divine essence (unless it be in the first article: we
   believe in one God'), and the main point with the Nicene fathers was to
   urge against Arianism the strict divinity and essential equality of the
   Son and Holy Ghost with the Father. If we press the difference of
   homoousion from monoousion, and overlook the many passages in which
   they assert with equal emphasis the monarchia or numerical unity of the
   Godhead, we must charge them with tritheism."

   Gieseler goes much further, and denies that the Nicene fathers held the
   numerical identity of essence in the persons of the Trinity. The
   Father, Son, and Spirit were the same in substance as having the same
   nature, or same kind of substance. This he infers was their doctrine
   not only from the general style of their teaching, and from special
   declarations, but from the illustrations which they habitually
   employed. The Father and the Son are the same in substance as among men
   father and son have the same nature; or as Basil says, Father and Son
   differ in rank, as do the angels, although they are the same in nature.
   Gieseler says that the numerical sameness of nature in the three divine
   persons, was first asserted by Augustine. It was he, according to
   Gieseler, who first excluded all idea of subordination in the Trinity.
   [476] "Athanasius and Hilary understood the proposition, There is one
   God' of the Father. Basil the Great and the two Gregories understood by
   the word God a generic idea (Gattungsbegriff), belonging equally to the
   Father and the Son. Basil in the Apologia ad Cæsarienses,' says, hemeis
   hena theon, cu to arithmo, alla te phusei homologoumen, and endeavours
   to show that there can be no question of number in reference to God, as
   numerical difference pertains only to material things. Augustine on the
   contrary expressly excludes the idea of generic unity, [477] and
   understands the proposition there is one God' not of the Father alone,
   but of the whole Trinity, [478] and, therefore, taught that there is
   one God in three persons." This, however, is the precise doctrine of
   the Nicene Creed itself, which affirms faith "in one God," and not in
   three. Basil in the place quoted is refuting the charge of Tritheism.
   His words are, pros de tous epereazontas hemin to tritheon, ekeino
   legestho hotiper hemeis hena theon, etc. [479] On page 460 reasons have
   already been given for assuming that the sameness of substance taught
   by the Nicene fathers was not simply generic but numerical. On this
   subject Pearson, a thorough advocate of the Nicene Creed, says, "As it
   (the divine nature) is absolutely immaterial and incorporeal, it is
   also indivisible; Christ cannot have any part of it only communicated
   unto Him, but the whole, by which He must be acknowledged co-essential,
   of the same substance with the Father; as the Council of Nice
   determined, and the ancient fathers before them taught." [480] If the
   whole divine essence belongs equally to the several persons of the
   Trinity, there is an end to the question, whether the sameness be
   specific or numerical. Accordingly the Bishop says: "The Divine essence
   being by reason of its simplicity not subject to division, and in
   respect of its infinity uncapable of multiplication, is so communicated
   as not to be multiplied; insomuch that He which proceedeth by that
   communication hath not only the same nature, but is also the same God.
   The Father God, and the Word God; Abraham man, and Isaac man: but
   Abraham one man, Isaac another man; not so the Father one God, and the
   Word another, but the Father and the Word both the same God." [481]

   Gieseler says that Augustine effectually excluded all idea of
   subordination in the Trinity by teaching the numerical sameness of
   essence in the persons of the Godhead. This does indeed preclude all
   priority and all superiority as to being and perfection. But it does
   not preclude subordination as to the mode of subsistence and operation.
   This is distinctly recognized in Scripture, and was as fully taught by
   Augustine as by any of the Greek fathers, and is even more distinctly
   affirmed in the so-called Athanasian Creed, representing the school of
   Augustine, than in the Creed of the Council of Nice. There is,
   therefore, no just ground of objection to the Nicene Creed for what it
   teaches on that subject. It does not go beyond the facts of Scripture.
   But the fathers who framed that creed, and those by whom it was
   defended, did go beyond those facts. They endeavoured to explain what
   was the nature of that subordination. While denying to the Father any
   priority or superiority to the other persons of the Trinity, as to
   being or perfection, they still spoke of the Father as the Monas, as
   having in order of thought the whole Godhead in Himself; so that He
   alone was God of Himself (autotheos, in that sense of the word), that
   He was the fountain, the cause, the root, fons, origo, principium, of
   the divinity as subsisting in the Son and Spirit; that He was greater
   than the other divine persons. They understood many passages which
   speak of the inferiority of the Son to the Father, of the Logos as
   such; and not of the historical Son of God clothed in our nature. Thus
   Waterland [482] says of these fathers, "The title of ho Theos, being
   understood in the same sense with autotheos, was, as it ought to be,
   generally reserved to the Father, as the distinguishing personal
   character of the first person of the Holy Trinity. And this amounts to
   no more than the acknowledgment of the Father's prerogative as Father.
   But as it might also signify any Person who is truly and essentially
   God, it might properly be applied to the Son too: and it is so applied
   sometimes, though not so often as it is to the Father."

   Hilary of Poictiers expresses the general idea of the Nicene fathers on
   this point, when he says: "Et quis non Patrem potiorem confitebitur, ut
   ingenitum a genito, ut patrem a filio, ut eum qui miserit ab eo qui
   missus est, ut volentem ab ipso qui obediat? Et ipse nobis erit testis:
   Pater major me est. Hæc ita ut sunt, intelligenda sunt, sed cavendum
   est, ne apud imperitos gloriam Filii honor Patris infirmet." [483]

   Bishop Pearson [484] says the preëminence of the Father "undeniably
   consisteth in this: that He is God not of any other but of Himself, and
   that there is no other person who is God, but is God of Himself. It is
   no diminution to the Son, to say He is from another, for his very name
   imports as much; but it were a diminution to the Father to speak so of
   Him; and there must be some preëminence, where there is place for
   derogation. What the Father is, He is from none; what the Son is, He is
   from Him; what the first is, He giveth; what the second is, He
   receiveth. The First is Father indeed by reason of his Son, but He is
   not God by reason of Him; whereas the Son is not so only in regard of
   the Father, but also God by reason of the same." Among the patristical
   authorities quoted by Pearson, are the following from Augustine: [485]
   "Pater de nullo patre, Filius de Deo Patre. Pater quod est, a nullo
   est: quod autem Pater est, propter Filium est. Filius vero et quod
   Filius est, propter Patrem est, et quod est, a Patre est." "Filius non
   hoc tantum habet nascendo, ut Filius sit, sed omnino ut sit. . . . .
   Filius non tantum ut sit Filius, quod relative dicitur, sed omnino ut
   sit, ipsam substantiam nascendo habet." [486]

   The Reformers themselves were little inclined to enter into these
   speculations. They were specially repugnant to such a mind as Luther's.
   He insisted on taking the Scriptural facts as they were, without any
   attempt at explanation. He says: "We should, like the little children,
   stammer out what the Scriptures teach: that Christ is truly God, that
   the Holy Ghost is truly God, and yet that there are not three Gods, or
   three Beings, as there are three Men, three Angels, three Suns, or
   three Windows. No, God is not thus divided in his essence; but there is
   one only divine Being or substance. Therefore, although there are three
   persons, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, yet the
   Being is not divided or distinguished; since there is but one God in
   one single, undivided, divine substance." [487]

   Calvin also was opposed to going beyond the simple statement of the
   Scriptures. [488] After saying that Augustine devotes the fifth book on
   the Trinity to the explanation of the relation between the Father and
   the Son, he adds: "Longe vero tutius est in ea quam tradit relatione
   subsistere, quam subtilius penetrando ad sublime mysterium, per multas
   evanidas speculationes evagari. Ergo quibus cordi erit sobrietas et qui
   fidei mensura contenti erunt, breviter quod utile est cognitu
   accipiant: nempe quum profitemur nos credere in unum Deum, sub Dei
   nomine intelligi unicam et simplicem essentiam, in qua comprehendimus
   tres personas vel hypostaseis: ideoque quoties Dei nomen indefinite
   ponitur, non minus Filium et Spiritum, quam Patrem designari: ubi autem
   adjungitur Filius Patri, tunc in medium venit relatio: atque ita
   distinguimus inter personas. Quia vero proprietates in personis ordinem
   secum ferunt, ut in Patre sit principium et origo: quoties mentio sit
   Patris et Filii simul, vel Spiritus, nomen Dei peculiariter Patri
   tribuitur. Hoc modo retinetur unitas essentiæ et habetur ratio ordinis,
   quæ tamen ex Filii et Spiritus deitate nihil minuit: et certe quum ante
   visum fuerit Apostolos asserere Filium Dei illum esse, quem Moses et
   Prophetæ testati sunt esse Jehovam, semper ad unitatem essentiæ, venire
   necesse est." We have here the three essential facts involved in the
   doctrine of the Trinity, namely, unity of essence, distinction of
   persons, and subordination without any attempt at explanation.

   Calvin was accused by some of his contemporaries of teaching the
   incompatible doctrines of Sabellianism and Arianism. In a letter to his
   friend Simon Grynée, rector of the Academy of Basle, dated May, 1537,
   he says the ground on which the charge of Sabellianism rested, was his
   having said that Christ was "that Jehovah, who of Himself alone was
   always self-existent, which charge," he says, "I was quite ready to
   meet." His answer is: "If the distinction between the Father and the
   Word be attentively considered, we shall say that the one is from the
   other. If, however, the essential quality of the Word be considered, in
   so far as He is one God with the Father, whatever can be said
   concerning God may also be applied to Him the Second Person in the
   glorious Trinity. Now, what is the meaning of the name Jehovah? What
   did that answer imply which was spoken to Moses? I AM THAT I AM. Paul
   makes Christ the author of this saying." [489] This argument is
   conclusive. If Christ be Jehovah, and if the name Jehovah implies
   self-existence, then Christ is self-existent. In other words,
   self-existence and necessary existence, as well as omnipotence and all
   other divine attributes, belong to the divine essence common to all the
   persons of the Trinity, and therefore it is the Triune God who is
   self-existent, and not one person in distinction from the other
   persons. That is, self-existence is not to be predicated of the divine
   essence only, nor of the Father only, but of the Trinity, or of the
   Godhead as subsisting in three persons. And, therefore, as Calvin says,
   when the word God is used indefinitely it means the Triune God, and not
   the Father in distinction from the Son and Spirit.

   B. Eternal Generation.

   As in reference to the subordination of the Son and Spirit to the
   Father, as asserted in the ancient creeds, it is not to the fact that
   exception is taken, but to the explanation of that fact, as given by
   the Nicene fathers, the same is true with regard to the doctrine of
   Eternal Generation. It is no doubt a Scriptural fact that the relation
   between the First and Second persons of the Trinity is expressed by the
   relative terms Father and Son. It is also said that the Son is begotten
   of the Father; He is declared to be the only begotten Son of God. The
   relation, therefore, of the Second Person to the First is that of
   filiation or sonship. But what is meant by the term, neither the Bible
   nor the ancient creeds explain. It may be sameness of nature; as a son
   is of the same nature as his father. It may be likeness, and the term
   Son be equivalent to eikon, apaugasma, charakter, or logos, or
   revealer. It may be derivation of essence, as a son, in one sense, is
   derived from his father. Or, it may be something altogether inscrutable
   and to us incomprehensible.

   The Nicene fathers, instead of leaving the matter where the Scriptures
   leave it, undertake to explain what is meant by sonship, and teach that
   it means derivation of essence. The First Person of the Trinity is
   Father, because He communicates the essence of the Godhead to the
   Second Person; and the Second Person is Son, because He derives that
   essence from the First Person. This is what they mean by Eternal
   Generation. Concerning which it was taught, --

   1. That it was the person not the essence of the Son that was
   generated. The essence is self-existent and eternal, but the person of
   the Son is generated (i.e., He becomes a person) by the communication
   to Him of the divine essence. This point continued to be insisted upon
   through the later periods of the Church. Thus Turrettin [490] says,
   "Licet Filius sit a Patre, non minus tamen autotheos dicitur, non
   ratione Personæ, sed ratione Essentiæ; non relate qua Filius, sic enim
   est a Patre, sed absolute qua Deus, quatenus habet Essentiam divinam a
   se existentem, et non divisam vel productam ab alia essentia, non vero
   qua habens essentiam illam a seipso. Sic Filius est Deus a seipso,
   licet non sit a seipso Filius."

   Again, [491] "Persona bene dicitur generare Personam, quia actiones
   sunt suppositorum; sed non Essentia Essentiam, quia quod gignit et
   gignitur necessario multiplicatur, et sic via sterneretur ad
   Tritheismum. Essentia quidem generando communicatur; sed generatio, ut
   a Persona fit originaliter, ita ad Personam terminatur." This is the
   common mode of representation.

   2. This generation is said to be eternal. "It is an eternal movement in
   the divine essence."

   3. It is by necessity of nature, and not by the will of the Father.

   4. It does not involve any separation or division, as it is not a part,
   but the whole and complete essence of the Father that is communicated
   from the Father to the Son.

   5. It is without change.

   The principal grounds urged in support of this representation, are the
   nature of sonship among men, and the passage in John v. 26, where it is
   said, "As the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son
   to have life in Himself."

   It is admitted that the relation between the First and Second persons
   in the Trinity is expressed by the words Father and Son, and therefore
   while everything in this relation as it exists among men, implying
   imperfection or change, must be eliminated, yet the essential idea of
   paternity must be retained. That essential idea is assumed to be the
   communication of the essence of the parent to his child; and,
   therefore, it is maintained that there must be a communication of the
   essence of the Godhead from the Father to the Son in the Holy Trinity.
   But, in the first place, it is a gratuitous assumption that, so far as
   the soul is concerned, there is even among men any communication of the
   essence of the parent to the child. Traducianism has never been the
   general doctrine of the Christian Church. As, therefore, it is, to say
   the least, doubtful, whether there is any communication of the essence
   of the soul in human paternity, it is unreasonable to assume that such
   communication is essential to the relation of Father and Son in the
   Trinity.

   In the second place, while it is admitted that the terms Father and Son
   are used to give us some idea of the mutual relation of the First and
   Second persons of the Trinity, yet they do not definitely determine
   what that relation is. It may be equality and likeness. Among men
   Father and Son belong to the same order of beings. The one is not
   inferior in nature, although he may be in rank, to the other. And the
   son is like his father. In the same manner in the Holy Trinity the
   Second Person is said to be the eikon, the apaugasma, the charakter,
   the logos, the Word or Revealer of the Father, so that he who hears the
   Son hears the Father, he who hath seen the one has seen the other. Or
   the relation may be that of affection. The reciprocal love of father
   and son is peculiar. It is, so to speak, necessary; it is unchangeable,
   it is unfathomable; it leads, or has led, to every kind and degree of
   self-sacrifice. It is not necessary to assume in reference to the
   Trinity that these relations are all that the relative terms Father and
   Son are intended to reveal. These may be included, but much more may be
   implied which we are not now able to comprehend. All that is contended
   for is, that we are not shut up to the admission that derivation of
   essence is essential to sonship.

   As to the passage in John v. 26, where it is said the Father hath given
   to the Son to have life in Himself, everything depends on the sense in
   which the word Son is to be taken. That word is sometimes used as a
   designation of the logos, the Second Person of the Trinity, to indicate
   his eternal relation to the First Person as the Father. It is, however,
   very often used as a designation of the incarnate logos, the Word made
   flesh. Many things are in Scripture predicated of the Godman, which
   cannot be predicated of the Second Person of the Trinity as such. If in
   this passage the Son means the Logos, then it does teach that the First
   Person of the Trinity communicated life, and therefore the essence in
   which that life inheres, to the Second Person. But if Son here
   designates the Theanthropos, then the passage teaches no such doctrine.
   That it is the historical person, Jesus of Nazareth here spoken of, may
   be argued not only from the fact that He is elsewhere so frequently
   called the Son of God, as in the comprehensive confession required of
   every Christian in the apostolic age, "I believe that Jesus is the Son
   of God;" but also from the context. Our Lord had healed an impotent man
   on the Sabbath. For this the Jews accused Him of breaking the Sabbath.
   He vindicated Himself by saying that He had the same right to work on
   the Sabbath that God had, because He was the Son of God, and therefore
   equal with God. That He had power not only to heal but to give life,
   just as the Father had life in Himself, so had He given to the Son to
   have life in Himself. He had also given Him authority to execute
   judgment. He was to be the judge of the quick and dead, because He is
   the Son of man, i.e., because He had become man for us and for our
   salvation. His accusers need not be surprised at what He said, because
   the hour was coming when all who are in the grave shall hear his voice,
   and shall come forth, they who have done good, unto the resurrection of
   life, and they who had done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.
   The subject of discourse, therefore, in the context, is the historical
   person who had healed the impotent man, and who with equal propriety
   could be called God or man, because He was both God and man. What the
   passage teaches, therefore, concerns the constitution of Christ's
   person as He appeared on earth, and not the nature of the relation of
   the Father and Son in the Godhead.

   C. Eternal Sonship.

   There is, therefore, a distinction between the speculations of the
   Nicene fathers, and the decisions of the Nicene Council. The latter
   have been accepted by the Church universal, but not the former. The
   Council declared that our Lord is the Eternal Son of God, i.e., that He
   is from eternity the Son of God. This of course involves the denial
   that He became the Son of God in time; and, consequently, that the
   primary and essential reason for his being called Son is not his
   miraculous birth, nor his incarnation, nor his resurrection, nor his
   exaltation to the right hand of God. The Council decided that the word
   Son as applied to Christ, is not a term of office but of nature; that
   it expresses the relation which the Second Person in the Trinity from
   eternity bears to the First Person, and that the relation thus
   indicated is sameness of nature, so that sonship, in the case of
   Christ, includes equality with God. In other words, God was in such a
   sense his Father that He was equal with God. And consequently every
   time the Scriptures call Jesus the Son of God, they assert his true and
   proper divinity. This does not imply that every time Christ is called
   the Son of God, what is said of Him is to be understood of his divine
   nature. The fact is patent, and is admitted that the person of our Lord
   may be designated from either nature. He may be called the Son of David
   and the Son of God. And his person may be designated from one nature
   when what is predicated of Him is true only of the other nature. Thus,
   on the one hand, the Lord of Glory was crucified; God purchased the
   Church with his blood; and the Son is said to be ignorant; and, on the
   other hand, the Son of Man is said to be in heaven when He was on
   earth. This being admitted it remains true that Christ is called the
   Son of God as to his divine nature. The Logos, the Second Person of the
   Trinity as such and because of his relation to the First Person, is the
   Son of God. Such is the doctrine of the Nicene Council, and that it is
   no less the doctrine of the Scriptures, is plain from the following
   considerations : --

   1. The terms Father, Son, and Spirit, as applied to the persons of the
   Trinity, are relative terms. The relations which they express are
   mutual relations, i.e., relations in which the different persons stand
   one to another. The First Person is called Father, not because of his
   relation to his creatures, but because of his relation to the Second
   Person. The Second Person is called Son, not because of any relation
   assumed in time, but because of his eternal relation to the First
   Person. And the Third Person is called Spirit because of his relation
   to the First and Second.

   2. If, as the whole Christian Church believes, the doctrine of the
   Trinity is a Scriptural doctrine, and if, as is also admitted by all
   the parties to this discussion, it was the purpose of God to reveal
   that doctrine to the knowledge and faith of his people, there is a
   necessity for the use of terms by which the persons of the Trinity
   should be designated and revealed. But if the terms Father, Son, and
   Spirit do not apply to the persons of the Trinity as such, and express
   their mutual relations, there are no such distinctive terms in the
   Bible by which they can be known and designated.

   3. There are numerous passages in the Scriptures which clearly prove
   that our Lord is called Son, not merely because He is the image of God,
   or because He is the object of peculiar affection, nor because of his
   miraculous conception only; nor because of his exaltation, but because
   of the eternal relation which He sustains to the First Person of the
   Trinity. These passages are of two kinds. First, those in which the
   Logos is called Son, or in which Christ as to his divine nature and
   before his incarnation is declared to be the Son of God; and secondly,
   those in which the application of the term Son to Christ involves the
   ascription of divinity to Him. He is declared to be the Son of God in
   such a sense as implies equality with God. To the former of these
   classes belong such passages as the following: Rom. i. 3, 4, where
   Christ is declared to be kata sarka, the Son of David, and kata pneuma
   hagiosunes, the Son of God. That pneuma hagiosunes does not here mean
   the Holy Spirit, much less a pneumatic state, but the higher or divine
   nature of Christ, is evident from the antithesis. As to his human
   nature, He is the Son of David; as to his divine nature, He is the Son
   of God. As to his humanity, He is consubstantial with man; as to his
   divinity, He is consubstantial with God. If his being the Son of David
   proves He was a man, his being the Son of God proves that He is God.
   Hence Christ was called Son before his incarnation, as in Gal. iv. 4,
   "God sent forth his Son, made of a woman." It was the Logos that was
   sent, and the Logos was Son. Thus in John i. 1-14, we are taught that
   the Logos was in the beginning with God, that He was God, that He made
   all things, that He was the light and life of men, and that He became
   flesh, and revealed his glory as the Son of God. Here it is plain that
   the Logos or Word is declared to be the Son. And in the eighteenth
   verse of that chapter it is said, "No man hath seen God at any time;
   the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father (o on eis
   ton kolpon tou patros, He hath declared Him." Here the present tense, o
   on, expresses permanent being; He who is, was, and ever shall be, in
   the bosom of the Father, i.e., most intimately united with Him, so as
   to know Him, as He knows Himself, is the Son. According to Chrysostom,
   this language implies the sungeneia kai henotes tes ousias of the
   Father and the Son, which were not interrupted by his manifestation in
   the flesh. To the latter class belong such passages as the following:
   John v. 18-25, where Christ calls God his Father in a sense which
   implied equality with God. If sonship implies equality with God, it
   implies participation of the divine essence. It was for claiming to be
   the Son of God in this sense, that the Jews took up stones to stone
   Him. Our Lord defended Himself by saying that He had the same power God
   had, the same authority, the same life-giving energy, and therefore was
   entitled to the same honour. In John x. 30-38 there is a similar
   passage, in which Christ says that God is his Father in such a sense
   that He and the Father are one. In the first chapter of the Epistle to
   the Hebrews, it is argued that Christ does not belong to the category
   of creatures; that all angels (i.e., all intelligent creatures higher
   than man) are subject to Him, and are required to worship Him because
   He is the Son of God. As Son He is the brightness of the Father's
   glory, the express image of his person, upholding all things by the
   word of his power. Because He is the Son of God, He is the God who in
   the beginning laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are
   the work of his hands. They are mutable, but He is unchangeable and
   eternal.

   There can, therefore, be no reasonable doubt that according to the
   Scriptures, the term Son as applied to Christ expresses the relation of
   the Second to the First Person in the adorable Trinity. In other words,
   it is not merely an official title, but designates the Logos and not
   exclusively the Theanthropos.

   4. Another argument in proof of this doctrine is derived from the fact
   that Christ is declared to be "the only-begotten Son of God," "his own
   Son," i.e., his Son in a peculiar and proper sense. Angels and men are
   called the sons of God, because He is the Father of all spirits. Holy
   men are his sons because partakers of his moral nature, as wicked men
   are called children of the devil. God's people are his sons and
   daughters by regeneration and adoption. It is in opposition to all
   these kinds of sonship that Christ is declared to be God's only Son,
   the only person in the universe to whom the word can be applied in its
   full sense as expressing sameness of essence.

   Objections to the Doctrine.

   The speculative objections to this doctrine of eternal sonship have
   already been considered. If Christ is Son, if He is God of God, it is
   said He is not self-existent and independent. But self-existence,
   independence, etc., are attributes of the divine essence, and not of
   one person in distinction from the others. It is the Triune God who is
   self-existent and independent. Subordination as to the mode of
   subsistence and operation, is a Scriptural fact; and so also is the
   perfect and equal Godhead of the Father and the Son, and therefore
   these facts must be consistent. In the consubstantial identity of the
   human soul there is a subordination of one faculty to another, and so,
   however incomprehensible to us, there may be a subordination in the
   Trinity consistent with the identity of essence in the Godhead.

   Psalm ii. 7.

   More plausible objections are founded on certain passages of the
   Scriptures. In Ps. ii. 7, it is said, "Thou art my Son; this day have I
   begotten thee." From this it is argued that Christ or the Messiah was
   constituted or made the Son of God in time, and therefore was not the
   Son of God from eternity. To this it may be answered, --

   1. That the term Son, as used in the Scriptures, expresses different
   relations, and therefore may be applied to the same person for
   different reasons; or, have one meaning, i.e., express one relation in
   one place, and a different one in another. It may refer or be applied
   to the Logos, or to the Theanthropos. One ground for the use of the
   designation does not exclude all the others. God commanded Moses to say
   unto Pharaoh, "Israel is my son, even my first-born." (Ex. iv. 22.) And
   He said of Solomon, "I will be his father and he shall be my son." (2
   Sam. vii. 14.) The word son here expresses the idea of adoption, the
   selection of one people or of one man out of many to stand to God in a
   peculiar relation of intimacy, affection, honour, and dignity. If for
   these reasons the theocratic people, or a theocratic king, may be
   called the Son of God, for the same reasons, and preeminently, the
   Messiah may be so designated. But this is no argument to prove that the
   Logos may not in a far higher sense be called the Son of God.

   2. The passage in question, however, need not be understood of an event
   which occurred in time. Its essential meaning is, "Thou art my Son, now
   art thou my Son." The occasion referred to by the words "this day" was
   the time when the Sonship of the king of Zion should be fully
   manifested. That time, as we learn from Rom. i. 4, was the day of his
   resurrection. By his rising again from the dead, He was clearly
   manifested to be all that He claimed to be, -- the Son of God and the
   Saviour of the world.

   3. There is another interpretation of the passage which is essentially
   the same as that given by many of the fathers, and is thus presented by
   Dr. Addison Alexander in his commentary on Acts xiii. 33, "The
   expression in the Psalm, I have begotten thee,' means, I am He who has
   begotten thee, i. e., I am thy father. To-day' refers to the date of
   the decree itself (Jehovah said, Today, etc.); but this, as a divine
   act, was eternal, and so must be the Sonship which it affirms."

   Acts xiii. 32, 38.

   It may be urged, however, that in Acts xiii. 32, 33, this passage is
   quoted in the proof of the resurrection of Christ, which shows that the
   Apostle understood the passage to teach that Christ was begotten or
   made the Son of God when He rose from the dead. The passage in Acts
   reads thus in our version: "We declare unto you glad tidings, how that
   the promise which was made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled the
   same unto us their children, in that He hath raised up Jesus again
   (anastesas); as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my
   Son, this day have I begotten thee." Here there is no reference to the
   resurrection. The glad tidings which the Apostle announced was not the
   resurrection, but the advent of the Messiah. That was the promise made
   to the fathers, which God had fulfilled by raising up, i.e., bringing
   into the world the promised deliverer. Compare Acts ii. 30; iii. 22,
   26; vii. 31, in all which passages where the same word is used, the
   "raising up" refers to the advent of Christ; as when it is said, "A
   prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren,
   like unto me." The word is never used absolutely in reference to the
   resurrection unless, as in Acts ii. 32, where the resurrection is
   spoken of in the context. Our translators have obscured the meaning by
   rendering anastesas "having raised up again," instead of simply "having
   raised up," as they render it elsewhere.

   That this is the true meaning of the passage is clear from the
   succeeding verses. Paul having said that God had fulfilled his promise
   to the fathers by raising up Christ, agreeably to Psalm ii. 7,
   immediately adds as an additional fact, "And as concerning that He
   raised Him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, He
   said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David. Wherefore
   he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to
   see corruption." (Acts xiii. 34, 35.) The Apostle, therefore, does not
   teach that Christ was made the Son of God by his resurrection. But
   even, as just remarked, if He did teach that the Theanthropos was in
   one sense made the Son of God, that would not prove that the Logos was
   not Son in another and higher sense.

   Luke i. 35.

   The same remark is applicable to Luke i. 35: "The Holy Ghost shall come
   upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee;
   therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee, shall be
   called the Son of God." Bishop Pearson, one of the most strenuous
   defenders of "eternal generation," and of all the peculiarities of the
   Nicene doctrine of the Trinity, gives four reasons why the Theanthropos
   or Godman is called the Son of God. (1.) His miraculous conception.
   (2.) The high office to which he was designated. (John x. 34, 35, 36.)
   (3.) His resurrection, according to one interpretation of Acts xiii.
   33. "The grave," he says, "is as the womb of the earth; Christ, who is
   raised from thence, is as it were begotten to another life, and God,
   who raised him, is his Father." [492] (4.) Because after his
   resurrection He was made the heir of all things. (Heb. i. 2-5.) Having
   assigned these reasons why the Godman is called Son, he goes on to show
   why the Logos is called Son. There is nothing, therefore, in the
   passages cited inconsistent with the Church doctrine of the eternal
   Sonship of our Lord. The language of the angel addressed to the Virgin
   Mary, may, however, mean no more than this, namely, that the assumption
   of humanity by the eternal Son of God was the reason why He should be
   recognized as a divine person. It was no ordinary child who was to be
   born of Mary, but one who was, in the language of the prophets, to be
   the Wonderful, the Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father,
   the Son of the Highest. It was because the Eternal Son was made of a
   woman, that that Holy Thing born of the virgin was to be called the Son
   of God.

   It need hardly be remarked that no valid objection to the doctrine of
   the eternal Sonship of Christ, or, that He is Son as to his divine
   nature, can be drawn from such passages as speak of the Son as being
   less than the Father, or subject to Him, or even ignorant. If Christ
   can be called the Lord of glory, or God, when his death is spoken of,
   He may be called Son, when other limitations are ascribed to Him. As He
   is both God and man, everything that is true either of his humanity or
   of his divinity, may be predicated of Him as a person; and his person
   may be denominated from one nature, when the predicate belongs to the
   other nature. He is called the Son of Man when He is said to be
   omnipresent; and He is called God when He is said to have purchased the
   Church with his blood.

   D. The Relation of the Spirit to the other Persons of the Trinity.

   As the councils of Nice and Constantinople were fully justified by
   Scripture in teaching the eternal Sonship of Christ, so what they
   taught of the relation of the Spirit to the Father and the Son, has an
   adequate Scriptural foundation.

   That relation is expressed by the word procession, with regard to which
   the common Church doctrine is, (1.) That it is incomprehensible, and
   therefore inexplicable. (2.) That it is eternal (3.) That it is equally
   from the Father and the Son. At least such is the doctrine of the Latin
   and all other Western churches. (4.) That this procession concerns the
   personality and operations of the Spirit, and not his essence.

   The Scriptural grounds for expressing this relation by the term
   procession, are (1.) The signification of the word spirit. It means
   breath, that which proceeds from, and which gives expression and effect
   to our thoughts. Since Father and Son, as applied to the First and
   Second persons of the Trinity, are relative terms, it is to be assumed
   that the word Spirit as the designation of the Third Person, is also
   relative. (2.) This is further indicated by the use of the genitive
   case in the expressions pneuma tou patros, tou huiou, which is
   explained by the use of the preposition ek, as pneuma ek tou patros.
   The revealed fact is that the Spirit is of the Father, and the Church
   in calling the relation, thus indicated, a procession. does not attempt
   to explain it. (3.) In John xv. 26, where the Spirit is promised by
   Christ, He is said to proceed from the Father.

   That the Latin and Protestant churches, in opposition to the Greek
   Church, are authorized in teaching that the Spirit proceeds not from
   the Father only, but from the Father and the Son, is evident, because
   whatever is said in Scripture of the relation of the Spirit to the
   Father, is also said of his relation to the Son. He is said to be the
   "Spirit of the Father," and "Spirit of the Son;" He is given or sent by
   the Son as well as by the Father; the Son is said to operate through
   the Spirit. The Spirit is no more said to send or to operate through
   the Son, than to send or operate through the Father. The relation, so
   far as revealed, is the same in the one case as in the other.

   When we consider the incomprehensible nature of the Godhead, the
   mysterious character of the doctrine of the Trinity, the exceeding
   complexity and difficulty of the problem which the Church had to solve
   in presenting the doctrine that there are three persons and one God, in
   such a manner as to meet the requirements of Scripture and the
   convictions of believers, and yet avoid all contradiction, we can
   hardly fail to refer the Church creeds on this subject, which have for
   ages secured assent and consent, not to inspiration, strictly speaking,
   but to the special guidance of the Holy Spirit.

   § 7. Philosophical Form of the Doctrine of the Trinity.

   The philosophical statements of the doctrine of the Trinity have been
   intended by their authors either to prove it, or to illustrate it, or
   to explain it away and substitute some speculative theory as to the
   constitution of the universe for the Scriptural doctrine of the Triune
   God. The two former of these classes, those designed for proof, and
   those designed for illustration, need not be discriminated. It may be
   remarked in reference to them all that they are of little value. They
   do not serve to make the inconceivable intelligible. The most they can
   do, is to show that in other spheres and in relation to other subjects,
   we find a somewhat analogous triplicity in unity. In most cases,
   however, these illustrations proceed on the assumption that there are
   mysteries in the Godhead which have no counterpart in the constitution
   of our nature, or in anything around us in the present state of our
   existence.

   We have already seen that the fathers were accustomed to refer to the
   union of light, heat, and radiance in the one substance of the sun; to
   a fountain and its streams; to the root, stem, and flower of a plant;
   to the intellect, will, and affections in the soul; as examples of at
   least a certain kind of triplicity in unity, elsewhere than in the
   Godhead. The last-mentioned analogy, especially, was frequently
   presented, and that in different forms. Augustine said, that as man was
   made in the image of the Triune God, we have reason to expect something
   in the constitution of our nature answering to the Trinity in the
   Godhead. He refers to the memory, intelligence, and will, as
   co-existing in one mind, so that the operations of the one are involved
   in the operations of the others. Gregory of Nyssa refers for his
   illustration to the soul, the reason, and the living power, united in
   one spiritual substance in man. It was admitted, however, that these
   analogies did not hold as to the main point, for these different powers
   in man are not different subsistences, but different modes of activity
   of one and the same personal essence, so that these illustrations lead
   rather to the Sabellian, than to the Scriptural view of the doctrine of
   the Trinity.

   By far the most common illustration was borrowed from the operations of
   our consciousness. We conceive of ourselves as objective to ourselves,
   and are conscious of the identity of the subject and object. We have
   thus the subjective Ego, the objective Ego, and the identity of the
   two; the desired Thesis, Analysis, and Synthesis. In one form or
   another, this illustration has come down from the fathers, through the
   schoolmen and reformers, to theologians of our own day. Augustine [493]
   says, "Est quædam imago Trinitatis, ipsa mens, et notitia ejus, quod
   est proles ejus ac de seipsa verbum ejus, et amor tertius, et hæc tria
   unum atque una substantia." Again, [494] "Hæc -- tria, memoria,
   intelligentia, voluntas, quoniam non sunt tres vitæ, sed una vita; nec
   tres mentes, sed una mens: consequenter utique nec tres substantiæ
   sunt, sed una substantia." And, [495] "Mens igitur quando cogitatione
   se conspicit, intelligit se et recognoscit: gignit ergo hunc
   intellectum et cognitionem suam. . . . . Hæc autem duo, gignens et
   genitum, dilectione tertia copulantur, quæ nihil est aliud quam
   voluntas fruendum aliquid appetens vel tenens." Anselm [496] has the
   same idea: "Habet mens rationalis, quum se cogitando intelligit, secum
   imaginem suam ex se natam, id est cogitationem sui ad suam
   similitudinem, quasi sua impressione formatam, quamvis ipsa se a sua
   imagine, non nisi ratione sola, separare possit, quæ imago ejus verbum
   ejus est. Hoc itaque modo, quis neget, summam sapientem, quum se
   dicendo intelligit, gignere consubstantialem sibi similitudinem suam,
   id est Verbum suum." Melancthon [497] adopts and carries out the same
   idea: "Filius dicitur imago et logos: est igitur imago cogitatione
   Patris genita; quod ut aliquo modo considerari possit, a nostra mente
   exempla capiamus. Voluit enim Deus in homine conspici vestigia
   sua. . . . . Mens humana cogitando mox pingit imaginem rei cogitatæ,
   sed nos non transfundimus nostram essentiam in illas imagines, suntque
   cogitationes illæ subitæ et evanescentes actiones. At Pater æternus
   sese intuens gignit cogitatonem sui, quæ est imago ipsius, non
   evanescens, sed subsistens, communicata ipsi essentia. Hæc igitur imago
   est secunda persona. . . . . Ut autem Filius nascitur cogitatione, ita
   Spiritus Sanctus procedit a voluntate Patris et Filii; voluntatis enim
   est agitare, diligere, sicut et cor humanam non imagines, sed spiritus
   seu halitus gignit." Leibnitz, [498] says "Je ne trouve rien dans les
   créatures de plus propre à illustrer ce sujet, que la réflexion des
   espirits, lorsqu'un même esprit est son propre objet immediat, et agit
   sur soi-même en pensant à soi-même et à ce qu'il fait. Car le
   redoublement donne une image ou ombre de deux substances respectives
   dans une même substance absolue, savoir de celle qui entend, et de
   celle qui est entendue; l'un et l'autre de ces êtres est substantiel,
   l'un et l'autre est un concret individu, et ils différent par des
   rélations mutuelles, mais ils ne sont qu'une seule et même substance
   individuelle absolue."

   Of the theologians of the seventeenth century belonging to the Reformed
   Church, Keckermann was the most disposed to present the doctrines of
   the Bible in a philosophical form. We find, therefore, with him a
   similar attempt to make the mystery of the Trinity intelligible. He
   regards the existence of God as consisting in self-conscious thought.
   As thought is eternal, it must have an eternal, absolute, and perfect
   object. That object must, therefore, itself be God. The unity of the
   divine essence demands that this object should be in God himself, and
   therefore, it eternally returns to Him. [499]

   The modern theologians of Germany, who profess allegiance to the
   Scriptures, have, in many cases, taken the ground that absolute unity
   in the divine essence would be inconsistent with self-consciousness. We
   become self-conscious by distinguishing ourselves from what is not
   ourselves, and especially from other persons of like nature with
   ourselves. If, therefore, there were no person objective to God, to
   whom He could say Thou, He could not say I. Thus Martensen [500] says:
   Although the creature can have no adequate comprehension of the divine
   nature, we have a semblance of the Trinity in ourselves; as we are
   formed in the image of God, we have the right to conceive of God
   according to the analogy of our own nature. As distinction of persons
   is necessary to self-consciousness in us, so also in God. Therefore, if
   God be not a Trinity, He cannot be a person. How, he asks, can God from
   eternity be conscious of Himself as Father, without distinguishing
   Himself from Himself as Son? In other words, how can God be eternally
   self-conscious, without being eternally objective to Himself? That with
   us the objective Ego is merely ideal and not a different person from
   the subjective Ego, arises from our nature as creatures. With God,
   thinking and being are the same. In thinking Himself his thought of
   Himself is Himself in a distinct hypostasis. Dr. Shedd [501] has given
   a similar exposition, "in proof that the necessary conditions of
   self-consciousness in the finite spirit, furnish an analogue to the
   doctrine of the Trinity, and go to prove that trinity in unity is
   necessary to self-consciousness in the Godhead."

   Pantheistic Trinitarianism.

   In all that precedes, reference has been made to those who have had for
   their object to vindicate the doctrine of the Trinity, by showing that
   it is not out of analogy with other objects of human thought. There
   are, however, many modern systems which profess to be Trinitarian,
   which are in fact mere substitutions of the formulas of speculation for
   the doctrine of the Bible. Men speak of the Trinity, of the Father,
   Son, and Spirit, when they mean by those terms something which has not
   the least analogy with the doctrine of the Christian Church. Many by
   the Trinity do not mean a Trinity of persons in the Godhead, but either
   three radical forces, as it were, in the divine nature, which manifest
   themselves in different ways; or three different relations of the same
   subject; or three different states or stages of existence. Thus with
   some, the absolute power or efficiency of the Supreme Being considered
   as creating, upholding, and governing the world, is the Father; as
   illuminating rational creatures, is the Son; and, as morally educating
   them, is the Spirit. According to Kant, God as creator is the Father;
   as the preserver and governor of men, He is the Son; and as the
   administrator of law, as judge and rewarder, He is the Spirit. With
   DeWette, God in Himself is the Father; as manifested in the world, the
   Son; and as operating in nature, the Spirit. Schleiermacher says, God
   in Himself is the Father; God in Christ is the Son; God in the Church,
   is the Holy Spirit. The avowed Pantheists also use the language of
   Trinitarianism. God as the infinite and absolute Being is the Father;
   as coming to consciousness and existence in the world, He is the Son;
   as returning to Himself, the Spirit. Weisse attempts to unite Theism
   and Pantheism. He pronounces the Nicene doctrine of the Trinity the
   highest form of philosophical thought. He professes to adopt that
   doctrine ex animo in its commonly admitted sense. There is a threefold
   personality (Ichheit) in God necessary to the constitution of his
   nature. When the world was created the second of these persons became
   its life, merging his personality in the world and became impersonal,
   in order to raise the world into union and identity with God. When the
   curriculum of the world is accomplished, the Son resumes his
   personality. [502]

CHAPTER VII.

  THE DIVINITY OF CHRIST.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Testimony of the Old Testament.

   The doctrine of redemption is the distinguishing doctrine of the Bible.
   The person and work of the Redeemer is therefore the great theme of the
   sacred writers. From the nature of the work which He was to accomplish,
   it was necessary that He should be at once God and man. He must
   participate in the nature of those whom He came to redeem; and have
   power to subdue all evil, and dignity to give value to his obedience
   and sufferings. From the beginning to the end, therefore, of the sacred
   volume, from Genesis to Revelation, a Godman Redeemer is held up as the
   object of supreme reverence, love, and confidence to the perishing
   children of men. It is absolutely impossible to present a tithe of the
   evidence which the Scriptures contain of the truth of this doctrine. It
   is to the Bible what the soul is to the body -- its living and
   all-pervading principle, without which the Scriptures are a cold,
   lifeless system of history and moral precepts. It seems, therefore, to
   be a work of supererogation to prove to Christians the divinity of
   their Redeemer. It is like proving the sun to be the source of light
   and heat to the system of which it is the centre. Still as there are
   men, professing to be Christians, who deny this doctrine, as there have
   been, and still are men, who make the sun a mere satellite of the
   earth, it is necessary that a part at least of the evidence by which
   this great truth is proved should be presented, and should be at
   command to resist the gainsayers.

   The Protevangelium.

   Immediately after the apostasy of our first parents it was announced
   that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head. The
   meaning of this promise and prediction is to be determined by
   subsequent revelations. When interpreted in the light of the Scriptures
   themselves, it is manifest that the seed of the woman means the
   Redeemer, and that bruising the serpents head means his final triumph
   over the powers of darkness. In this protevangelium, as it has ever
   been called, we have the dawning revelation of the humanity and
   divinity of the great deliverer. As seed of the woman his humanity is
   distinctly asserted, and the nature of the triumph which he was to
   effect, in the subjugation of Satan, proves that he was to be a divine
   person. In the great conflict between good and evil, between the
   kingdom of light and the kingdom of darkness, between Christ and
   Belial, between God and Satan, he that triumphs over Satan, is, and can
   be nothing less than divine. In the earliest books of Scripture, even
   in Genesis, we have therefore clear intimations of two great truths;
   first, that there is a plurality of persons in the Godhead; and
   secondly, that one of those persons is specially concerned in the
   salvation of men, -- in their guidance, government, instruction, and
   ultimate deliverance from all the evils of their apostasy. The language
   employed in the record of the creation of man, "Let us make man, in our
   image, after our likeness," admits of no satisfactory explanation other
   than that furnished by the doctrine of the Trinity.

   Jehovah and the Angel Jehovah.

   On this primary and fundamental revelation of this great truth all the
   subsequent revelations of Scripture are founded. As there is more than
   one person in the Godhead, we find at once the distinction between
   Jehovah as the messenger, a mediator, and Jehovah as He who sends,
   between the Father and the Son, as co-equal, co-eternal persons, which
   runs through the Bible, with ever-increasing clearness. This is not an
   arbitrary or unauthorized interpretation of the Old Testament
   scriptures. In Luke xxiv. 27, it is said of our Lord, that "beginning
   at Moses, and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the
   Scriptures the things concerning Himself." Moses therefore did testify
   of Christ; and we have a sure ground on which to rest in interpreting
   the passages of the Old Testament, which set forth the person and work
   of the great deliverer, as referring to Christ.

   He who was promised to Adam as the seed of the woman, it was next
   declared should be the seed of Abraham. That this does not refer to his
   descendants collectively, but to Christ individually, we know from the
   direct assertion of the Apostle (Gal. iii. 16), and from the fulfilment
   of the promise. It is not through the children of Abraham as a nation,
   but through Christ, that all the nations of the earth are blessed. And
   the blessing referred to, the promise to Abraham, which, as the Apostle
   says, has come upon us, is the promise of redemption. Abraham therefore
   saw the day of Christ and was glad, and as our Lord said, Before
   Abraham was I am. This proves that the person predicted as the seed of
   the woman and as the seed of Abraham, through whom redemption was to be
   effected, was to be both God and man. He could not be the seed of
   Abraham unless a man, and he could not be the Saviour of men unless
   God.

   We accordingly find throughout the Old Testament constant mention made
   of a person distinct from Jehovah, as a person, to whom nevertheless
   the titles, attributes, and works of Jehovah are ascribed. This person
   is called the

   'lhym ,yhvh ,'lny ml'k yhvh? ,ml'k 'lhym.

   He claims divine authority, exercises divine prerogatives, and receives
   divine homage. If this were a casual matter, if in one or two instances
   the messenger spoke in the name of him who sent him, we might assume
   that the person thus designated was an ordinary angel or minister of
   God. But when this is a pervading representation of the Bible; when we
   find that these terms are applied, not first to one, and then to
   another angel indiscriminately, but to one particular angel; that the
   person so designated is also called the Son of God, the Mighty God;
   that the work attributed to him is elsewhere attributed to God himself;
   and that in the New Testament, this manifested Jehovah, who led his
   people under the Old Testament economy, is declared to be the Son of
   God, the logos, who was manifested in the flesh, it becomes certain
   that by the angel of Jehovah in the early books of Scripture, we are to
   understand a divine person, distinct from the Father.

   A. The Book of Genesis.

   Thus as early as Gen. xvi. 7, the angel of Jehovah appears to Hagar and
   says, "I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be
   numbered for multitude." And Hagar, it is said, "called the name of
   Jehovah that spake unto her [Attah el Roi] Thou God seest me" (ver.
   13). This angel therefore is declared to be Jehovah, and promises what
   God only could perform. Again, in Gen. xviii. 1, it is said, Jehovah
   appeared to Abraham in the plains of Mamre, who promised to him the
   birth of Isaac. In ver. 18, he is again called Jehovah. Jehovah said,
   "Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the time appointed I will return
   unto thee . . . . and Sarah shall have a son." As the angels turned
   toward Sodom, one of them, called Jehovah, said, "Shall I hide from
   Abraham that thing which I do?" and, "Jehovah said, Because the cry of
   Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous, I
   will go down now and see," etc., and Abraham, it is added, stood before
   Jehovah. Through the whole of Abraham's intercession in behalf of the
   cities of the plain, the angel is addressed as Adonai, a title given
   only to the true God, and speaks as Jehovah, and assumes the authority
   of God, to pardon or punish as to him seems fit. When the execution of
   the sentence pronounced on Sodom is mentioned, it is said, "Jehovah
   rained . . . . brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven." With
   regard to this and similar remarkable expressions, the question is not,
   What may they mean? but, What do they mean? Taken by themselves they
   may be explained away, but taken in the light of the connected
   revelations of God on the subject, it becomes apparent that Jehovah is
   distinguished as a person from Jehovah; and therefore that in the
   Godhead there is more than one person to whom the name Jehovah belongs.
   In this case, the words "brimstone and fire" may be connected with the
   words "from Jehovah," in the sense of "fire of God" as a figurative
   expression for the lightning. The passage would then mean simply,
   "Jehovah rained lightning on Sodom and Gomorrah." But this is not only
   against the authorized punctuation of the passage as indicated by the
   accents, but also against the analogy of Scripture. That is, it is an
   unnatural interpretation, and brings this passage into conflict with
   those in which the distinction between the angel of Jehovah and
   Jehovah, i.e., between the persons of the Godhead, is clearly
   indicated.

   In Gen. xxii. 2, God commands Abraham to offer up Isaac as a sacrifice.
   The angel of Jehovah arrests his hand at the moment of immolation, and
   says (ver. 12), "Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not
   withheld thy son, thine only son, from me." And in ver. 16, the angel
   of the Lord said, "By myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah . . . . that
   in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy
   seed." And Abraham called the name of that place "Jehovah-jireh." Here
   God, the angel of Jehovah, and Jehovah are names given to the same
   person, who swears by Himself and promises the blessing of a numerous
   posterity to Abraham. The angel of Jehovah must therefore be a divine
   person.

   In Jacob's vision, recorded Gen. xxviii. 11-22, he saw a ladder
   reaching to heaven, "and behold Jehovah stood above it, and said, I am
   the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land
   whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed. And thy
   seed shall be as the dust of the earth." Here the person elsewhere
   called the angel of Jehovah, and who had given the same promise to
   Abraham, is called the Lord God of Abraham and the God of Israel. In
   Gen. xxxii. 24-32, Jacob is said to have wrestled with an angel, who
   blessed him, and in seeing whom Jacob said, "I have seen God face to
   face." The prophet Hosea, xii. 4, in referring to this event, says,
   "Jacob had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made
   supplication unto him: he found him in Beth-el, and there he spake with
   us; even Jehovah God of Hosts; Jehovah is his memorial." The angel with
   whom Jacob wrestled, was the Lord God of Hosts.

   B. The other Historical Books of the Old Testament.

   In Exodus iii. we have the account of the revelation of God to Moses on
   Mount Horeb. "The angel of the Lord," it is said, "appeared unto him in
   a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush." And Moses turned to see
   this great sight, "and when Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see,
   God called unto him, out of the midst of the bush . . . . and said,
   Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the
   place whereon thou standest is holy ground. Moreover he said, I am the
   God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of
   Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God."
   Here the angel of Jehovah is identical with Jehovah, and is declared to
   be the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The personal distinction
   between Jehovah and the angel of Jehovah (i.e., between the Father and
   the Son, as these persons are elsewhere, and usually in the later
   Scriptures, designated), is clearly presented in Ex. xxiii. 20, where
   it is said, "Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee in the
   way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. Beware of
   him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your
   transgressions: for my name is in him." The last phrase is equivalent
   to, "I am in him." By the name of God, is often meant God himself as
   manifested. Thus it is said of the temple, 1 Kings viii. 29, "My name
   shall be there," i.e., "There will I dwell." As in the New Testament
   the Father is said to send the Son, and to be in Him; so here Jehovah
   is said to send the angel of Jehovah and to be in him. And as the Son
   of Man had power on earth to forgive sin, so the angel of Jehovah had
   authority to forgive or punish at his pleasure. Michaelis, in his
   marginal annotations to his edition of the Hebrew Bible, says in
   reference to this passage (Ex. xxiii. 20): "Bechaí ex Kabbala docet,
   hunc angelum non esse ex numero creatorum existentium extra Dei
   essentiam, sed ex emanationibus, quæ intra Dei essentiam subsistunt,
   sic in Tanchuma explicari, quod sit Metatron, Princeps faciei, John vi.
   46." That the angel of Jehovah is a divine person, is further manifest
   from the account given in Exodus xxxii. and xxxiii. of what God said to
   Moses after the people had sinned in worshipping the golden calf. In
   punishment of that offence God threatened no longer personally to
   attend the people. In consequence of this manifestation of the divine
   displeasure the whole congregation were assembled before the door of
   the Tabernacle, and humbled themselves before God. And Jehovah
   descended and spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his
   friend. And Moses interceded for the people and said, If thy presence
   go not with us carry us not up hence. And Jehovah said, My presence
   (i.e., I myself) shall go with thee and I will give thee rest. This
   shows that a divine person, Jehovah, had previously guided the people,
   and that on their repentance, He promised to continue with them. This
   person, called the angel of Jehovah, Jehovah himself, is in Is. lxiii.
   9, called "the angel of the face of Jehovah," i.e., the angel or the
   messenger, who is the image of God. It can hardly be doubted,
   therefore, that this angel was the Son of God, sent by Him and
   therefore called his angel; who in Is. lxiii. is designated as the
   Saviour of Israel and the Redeemer of Jacob; who came to reveal God, as
   He was the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person,
   in whom was his name, or, as it is expressed in the New Testament, the
   fulness of the Godhead; who in the fulness of time, for us men and for
   our salvation, became flesh, and revealed his glory as the only
   begotten Son full of grace and truth.

   In subsequent periods of the history of God's people this same divine
   person appears as the leader and God of Israel. He manifested himself
   to Joshua (v. 14) as "Prince of the host of the Lord"; to Gideon
   (Judges vi. 11), as the angel of Jehovah, and spake to him, saying,
   i.e., Jehovah said to him, Go in this thy might and thou shalt save
   Israel from the hand of the Midianites. In verse 16 it is again said,
   "Jehovah said unto him surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite
   the Midianites as one man." When Gideon became aware who it was that
   spoke to him he exclaimed, "Alas, O Lord God, for because I have seen
   the angel of Jehovah face to face. And Jehovah said unto him, Peace be
   unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die." The same angel appeared to
   Manoah and promised him a son, and revealed himself as he had done to
   Gideon by causing fire to issue from a rock and consume the sacrifice
   which had been placed upon it. When Manoah knew that it was the angel
   of Jehovah, he said unto his wife, "We shall surely die, because we
   have seen God."

   C. Different Modes of explaining these Passages.

   There are only three methods on which these and similar passages in the
   Old Testament can with any regard to the divine authority of the
   Scriptures be explained. The one is that the angel of Jehovah is a
   created angel, one of the spirits who wait continually on God and do
   his will. The fact that he assumes divine titles, claims divine
   prerogatives, and accepts divine homage, is explained on the principle,
   that the representative has a right to the titles and honours of the
   Being, or person whom he represents. He speaks as God because God
   speaks through him. This hypothesis, which was early and extensively
   adopted, might be admitted if the cases of the kind were few in number,
   and if the person designated as the angel of Jehovah did not so
   obviously claim to be himself Jehovah. And what is a more decisive
   objection to this mode of interpretation, is the authority of the
   subsequent parts of the Word of God. These passages do not stand alone.
   The Church might well hesitate on the ground of these early revelations
   to admit the doctrine of a plurality of persons in the Godhead. If
   everywhere else in Scripture God were revealed as only one person,
   almost any degree of violence of interpretation might be allowed to
   bring these passages into harmony with that revelation. But as the
   reverse is true; as with ever increasing clearness the existence of
   three persons in the Godhead is made known in Scripture, it becomes in
   the highest degree unnatural to explain these passages otherwise than
   in accordance with that doctrine. Besides this we have the express
   testimony of the inspired writers of the New Testament, that the angel
   of the Lord, the manifested Jehovah who led the Israelites through the
   wilderness, and who dwelt in the temple, was Christ; that is, was the
   logos, or Eternal Son of God, who became flesh and fulfilled the work
   which it was predicted the Messiah should accomplish. The Apostles do
   not hesitate to apply to Christ the language of the Old Testament used
   to set forth the majesty, the works, or the kingdom of the Jehovah of
   the Hebrew Scriptures. (John xii. 41; Rom. xiv. 11; 1 Cor. x. 4; Heb.
   i. 10-13, and often elsewhere.) The New Testament, therefore, clearly
   identifies the Logos or Son of God with the Angel of Jehovah, or
   Messenger of the Covenant, of the Old Testament.

   The second hypothesis on which these passages have been explained,
   admits that the angel of the Lord is a really divine person, but denies
   that he is personally distinguished from Jehovah. It was one and the
   same person who sent and was sent, was speaker and the one spoken to.
   But this assumption does such violence to all just rules of
   interpretation, and is so inconsistent with the subsequent revelations
   of the Word of God, that it has found little favour in the Church. We
   are, therefore, shut up to the only other mode of explaining the
   passages in question, which has been almost universally adopted in the
   Church, at least since the Reformation. This assumes the progressive
   character of divine revelation, and interprets the obscure intimations
   of the early Scriptures by the clearer light of subsequent
   communications. The angel, who appeared to Hagar, to Abraham, to Moses,
   to Joshua, to Gideon, and to Manoah, who was called Jehovah and
   worshipped as Adonai, who claimed divine homage and exercised divine
   power, whom the psalmists and prophets set forth as the Son of God, as
   the Counsellor, the Prince of Peace, the mighty God, and whom they
   predicted was to be born of a virgin, and to whom every knee should bow
   and every tongue confess, of things in heaven and things on earth, and
   things under the earth, is none other than He whom we now recognize and
   worship as our God and Saviour Jesus Christ. It was the Logos asarkos
   whom the Israelites worshipped and obeyed; and it is the Logos ensarkos
   whom we acknowledge as our Lord and God.

   It is universally admitted that the Old Testament does predict a
   Messiah, one who was to appear in the fulness of time to effect the
   redemption of his people, and through whom the knowledge of the true
   religion was to be extended throughout the world. While it is clearly
   revealed that this Redeemer was to be the seed of the woman, the seed
   of Abraham, of the tribe of Judah, and of the house of David, it was no
   less clearly revealed that He was to be a divine person. He is
   presented under the different aspects of a triumphant king, a suffering
   martyr, and a divine person. Sometimes these representations are all
   combined in the descriptions given of the coming Deliverer; sometimes
   the one, and sometimes the other view of his character is held up
   either exclusively or most prominently in the prophetic writings. They,
   however, are all exhibited in the Hebrew Scriptures, as they all
   combine and harmonize in the person and work of our Lord and Saviour

   D. The Psalms.

   In the second Psalm, the heathen are represented as combining against
   the Messiah, verses 1-3. God derides their efforts, verses 4, 5. He
   declares his purpose to constitute the Messiah king in Zion, That this
   Messiah is a divine person is plain: (1.) Because He is called the Son
   of God, which, as has been shown, implies equality with God. (2.) He is
   invested with universal and absolute dominion. (3.) He is the Jehovah
   whom the people are commanded in verse 11 to worship. (4.) Because all
   are required to acknowledge his authority and do Him homage. (5.)
   Because those are pronounced blessed who put their trust in Him,
   whereas the Scriptures declared them to be cursed who put their trust
   in princes.

   In the twenty-second Psalm, a sufferer is described whose words our
   Lord upon the cross appropriates to Himself, verses 1-19. He prays for
   deliverance, verses 19-21. The consequences of that deliverance are
   such as prove that the subject of the psalm must be a divine person.
   His sufferings render it certain, (1.) That all good men will fear and
   love God because He rescued this sufferer from his enemies. (2.) That
   provision will be made for the wants of all men. (3.) That all nations
   will be converted unto God. (4.) That the blessings which He secures
   will last forever.

   In the forty-fifth Psalm a king is described who must be a divine
   person. (1.) Because his perfect excellence is the ground of the praise
   rendered to Him. (2.) Because his kingdom is declared to be righteous
   and everlasting. (3.) He is addressed as God, "Thy throne O God is
   forever and ever," which is quoted Heb. i. 8, and applied to Christ for
   the very purpose of proving that He is entitled to the worship of all
   intelligent creatures. (4.) The Church is declared to be his bride,
   which implies that He is to his people the object of supreme love and
   confidence.

   The seventy-second Psalm contains a description of an exalted king, and
   of the blessings of his reign. These blessings are of such a nature as
   to prove that the subject of the psalm must be a divine person. (1.)
   His kingdom is to be everlasting. (2.) Universal. (3.) It secures
   perfect peace with God and good-will among men. (4.) All men are to be
   brought to submit to Him through love. (5.) In Him all the nations of
   the earth are to be blessed, i.e., as we are distinctly taught in Gal.
   iii. 16, it is in Him that all the blessings of redemption are to come
   upon the world. The subject of this psalm, is therefore, the Redeemer
   of the world.

   The hundred and tenth Psalm is repeatedly quoted and expounded in the
   New Testament, and applied to Christ to set forth the dignity of his
   person and the nature of his work. (1.) He is David's Lord. But if
   David's Lord, how can He be David's Son? This was the question which
   Christ put to the Pharisees, in order to convince them that their ideas
   of the Messiah fell far below the doctrine of their own Scriptures. He
   was indeed to be David's Son, as they expected, but at the same time He
   was to be possessed of a nature which made Him David's Lord. (2.) In
   virtue of this divine nature He was to sit at God's right hand; that
   is, to be associated with Him on terms of equality as to glory and
   dominion. Such is the Apostles exposition of this passage in Heb. i.
   13. To no angel, i.e., to no creature, has God ever said, "Sit on my
   right hand." The subject of this psalm is no creature; and if not a
   creature, He is the Creator. (3.) This person, who is at once David's
   Son and David's Lord, is eternally both priest and king. This again is
   referred to in Heb. vii. 17, to prove that He must be a divine person.
   It is only because He is possessed of "an endless life," or, as it is
   elsewhere said, because He has life in Himself even as the Father has
   life in Himself, that it is possible for Him to be a perpetual priest
   and king. (4.) In verse 5, He is declared to be the supreme Lord, for
   He is called Adonai, a title never given to any but the true God.

   E. The Prophetical Books.

   In Isaiah iv. 2, the appearance of the Branch of Jehovah is predicted,
   to whose advent such effects are ascribed as prove Him to be a divine
   person. Those effects are purification, the pardon of sin, and perfect
   security.

   Chapter vi. contains an account of the prophet's vision of Jehovah in
   his holy temple, surrounded by the hosts of adoring angels, who worship
   Him day and night. The person thus declared to be Jehovah, the object
   of angelic worship, the Apostle John tells us, iii. 41, was none other
   than Christ, whom all Christians and all angels now worship.

   In chapters vii.-ix. the birth of a child whose mother was a virgin, is
   predicted. That this child was the eternal Son of God, equal with the
   Father, is proved, (1.) From his name Immanuel, which means God with
   us, i.e., God in our nature. (2.) The land of Israel is said to be his
   land. (3.) He is called Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God, Father
   of Eternity, and Prince of Peace. (4.) His kingdom is everlasting and
   universal. (5.) The consequences of his advent and dominion are such as
   flow only from the dominion of God. In the eleventh chapter we have
   another description of the perfection of his person and of his kingdom,
   which is applicable only to the person and kingdom of God. It is only
   where God reigns that the peace, holiness, and blessedness which attend
   the coming of the predicted deliverer, are ever found. The same
   argument may be drawn from the prophetic account of the Messiah and of
   his kingdom contained in the latter part of Isaiah, from the fortieth
   chapter to the sixty-sixth. This Messiah was to effect the redemption
   of his people, not merely from the Babylonish captivity, but from all
   evil; to secure for them the pardon of sin, and reconciliation with
   God; the prevalence of true religion to the ends of the earth; and,
   finally, the complete triumph of the kingdom of light over the kingdom
   of darkness. This is a work which none other than a divine person could
   effect.

   The prophet Micah (v. 1-5) predicted that one was to be born in
   Bethlehem, who was to be, (1.) The Ruler of Israel, i.e., of all the
   people of God. (2.) Although to be born in time and made of a woman,
   his "goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting." (3.) He
   shall rule in the exercise of the strength and majesty of God, i.e.,
   manifest in his government the possession of divine attributes and
   glory. (4.) His dominion shall be universal; and (5.) Its effects
   peace; i.e., perfect harmony, order, and blessedness.

   The prophet Joel does not bring distinctly into view the person of the
   Redeemer, unless it be in the doubtful passage in ii. 23. He goes
   through the usual round of Messianic predictions; foretells the
   apostasy of the people, reproves them for their sins, threatens divine
   judgments, and then promises deliverance through a "teacher of
   righteousness" (according to one interpretation of ii. 23), and then
   the effusion of the Holy Spirit upon all flesh. The gift of the Holy
   Ghost is everywhere represented as the characteristic blessing of the
   Messianic period, because secured by the merit of the Redeemer's death.
   That He thus gives the Holy Spirit is the highest evidence of his being
   truly God.

   In Jeremiah xxiii., the restoration or redemption of God's people is
   foretold. This redemption was to be effected by one who as declared to
   be, (1.) A descendant of David. (2.) He is called the Branch, a
   designation which connects this prophecy with those of Isaiah in which
   the Messiah receives the same title. (3.) He was to be a king. (4.) His
   reign was to be prosperous, Judah and Israel were to be again united;
   i.e., perfect harmony and peace were to be secured. (5.) This deliverer
   is called Jehovah, our Righteousness. In the thirty-third chapter, the
   same deliverance is predicted, and the same name is here given to
   Jerusalem which in the former passage was given to the Messiah. In the
   one case it is symbolical, in the other significant.

   In Daniel ii. 44, it is foretold that the kingdom of the Messiah is to
   be everlasting, and is destined to supersede and absorb all other
   kingdoms. In vii. 9-14, it is said that one like unto the Son of Man
   was brought unto the Ancient of Days; and a dominion, glory, and
   kingdom given unto Him; that all people, nations, and languages should
   serve Him; his dominion is to be an everlasting dominion, which shall
   not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. In
   ix. 24-27, is recorded the prediction concerning the seventy weeks, and
   the coming and work of the Messiah, which work is truly divine.

   The first six chapters of the prophecies of Zechariah are a series of
   visions, foreshadowing the return of the Jews from Babylon, the
   restoration of the city, and the rebuilding of the temple; the
   subsequent apostasy of the people; the advent of the Messiah; the
   establishment of his kingdom, and the dispersion of the Jews. From the
   ninth chapter to the end of the book, the same events are predicted in
   ordinary prophetic language. Jerusalem is called upon to rejoice at the
   advent of her king. He was to be meek and lowly, unostentatious and
   peaceful, and his dominion universal. In chapter xi. He is represented
   as a shepherd who makes a last attempt to gather his flock. He is to be
   rejected by those whom He came to save, and sold for thirty pieces of
   silver. For this enormity the people are to be given up to long
   desolation; but at last God will pour upon them the Spirit of grace and
   supplication, and they shall look upon me, saith Jehovah, whom they
   have pierced, and mourn. This shepherd is declared to be God's fellow,
   associate, or equal. His kingdom shall triumph, shall become universal,
   and holiness shall everywhere prevail.

   In Malachi iii. 1-4, it is predicted (1.) That a messenger should
   appear to prepare the way of the Lord. (2.) That the Lord, i.e.,
   Jehovah, the messenger of the covenant, i.e., the Messiah, should come
   to his temple. (3.) At his advent the wicked shall be destroyed, and
   the Church saved. [503]

   It is plain, even from this cursory review, that the Old Testament
   clearly predicts the advent of a divine person clothed in our nature,
   who was to be the Saviour of the world. He was to be the seed of the
   woman, the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Judah, of the house of
   David; born of a virgin; a man of sorrows; and to make "his soul an
   offering for sin." He is, however, no less clearly declared to be the
   Angel of Jehovah, Jehovah, Elohim, Adonai, the Mighty God, exercising
   all divine prerogatives, and entitled to divine worship from men and
   angels. Such is the doctrine of the Old Testament as to what the
   Messiah was to be; and this is the doctrine of the New Testament, as to
   what Jesus of Nazareth in fact is.

   § 2. General Characteristics of the New Testament Teaching concerning
   Christ.

   A. The Sense in which Christ is called Lord.

   The first argument from the New Testament in proof of the divinity of
   Christ, is derived from the fact that He is everywhere called Lord; the
   Lord; our Lord. It is admitted that the Greek word kurios means owner,
   and one who has the authority of an owner, whether of men or things.
   The Lord of a vineyard is the owner of the vineyard, and the Lord of
   slaves is the owner of slaves. It is also admitted that the word is
   used with all the latitude of the Latin word Dominus, or the English
   Master or Mister. It is applied as a title of respect, not only to
   magistrates and princes, but to those who are not invested with any
   official authority. It is, therefore, not merely the fact that Jesus is
   called Lord, that proves that He is also God; but that He is called
   Lord in such a sense and in such a way as is consistent with no other
   hypothesis. In the first place, Christ is called Lord in the New
   Testament with the same constancy and with the same preeminence that
   Jehovah is called Lord in the Old Testament. This was the word which
   all the readers, whether of the Hebrew or Greek Scriptures, under the
   old economy were accustomed to use to express their relation to God.
   They recognized Him as their owner, as their Supreme Sovereign, and as
   their protector. He was in that sense their Lord. The Lord is on our
   side. The Lord be with you. The Lord He is God. Blessed is the nation
   whose God is the Lord. Thou Lord art good. Thou Lord art most high
   forever. O Lord, there is none like unto thee. I will praise the Lord.
   Have mercy upon me, O Lord. O Lord, thou art my God. The religious ear
   of the people was educated in the use of this language from their
   infancy. The Lord was their God. They worshipped and praised Him, and
   invoked his aid in calling him Lord. The same feelings of reverence,
   adoration, and love, the same sense of dependence and desire of
   protection are expressed throughout the New Testament in calling Jesus
   Lord. Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. Lord, save me. Joy
   of thy Lord. Lord, when saw we thee a hungered? He that judgeth me is
   the Lord. If the Lord will. To be present with the Lord. Them that call
   on the Lord. Which the Lord shall give me in the last day. Blessed are
   the dead who die in the Lord. Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory
   and honour.

   Jesus Christ, therefore, is Lord to Christians in the same sense that
   Jehovah was Lord to the Hebrews. The usage referred to is altogether
   peculiar; no man -- not Moses, nor Abraham, nor David, nor any of the
   prophets or Apostles, is ever thus prevailingly addressed or invoked as
   Lord. We have but one Lord; and Jesus Christ is Lord. This is an
   argument which addresses itself to the inward experience, rather than
   to the mere understanding. Every believer knows in what sense he calls
   Jesus Lord; and he knows that in thus recognizing Him as his owner, as
   his absolute sovereign, to whom the allegiance of his soul, and not
   merely of his outward life, is due; and as his protector and Saviour,
   he is in communion with the Apostles and martyrs. He knows that it is
   from the New Testament he has been taught to worship Christ in calling
   him Lord.

   But in the second place, Jesus Christ is not only thus called Lord by
   way of eminence, but He is declared to be the Lord of lords; to be the
   Lord of glory; the Lord of all; the Lord of the living and the dead;
   the Lord of all who are in heaven and on earth, and under the earth.
   All creatures, from the highest to the lowest, must bow the knee to
   Him, and acknowledge his absolute dominion. He is in such a sense Lord
   as that no man can truly call Him Lord but by the Holy Ghost. If his
   Lordship were merely the supremacy which one creature can exercise over
   other creatures, there would be no necessity for a divine illumination
   to enable us to recognize his authority. But if He is Lord in the
   absolute sense in which God alone is Lord; if He has a right in us, and
   an authority over us, which belong only to our Maker and Redeemer, then
   it is necessary that the Holy Spirit should so reveal to us the glory
   of God in the face of Jesus Christ, as to lead us to prostrate
   ourselves before Him as our Lord and our God.

   In the third place, Christ is called Lord, when that word is used for
   the incommunicable divine names and titles Jehovah and Adonai. It is
   well known that the Jews from an early period had a superstitious
   reverence, which prevented their pronouncing the word Jehovah. They
   therefore, in their Hebrew Scriptures, gave it the vowel points
   belonging to the word Adonai, and so pronounced it whenever they read
   the sacred volume. When they translated their Scriptures into Greek,
   they uniformly substituted kurios, which answers to Adon, for Jehovah.
   In like manner, under the influence of the LXX., the Latin Christians
   in their version used Dominus; and constrained by the same wide spread
   and long-continued usage, the English translators have, as a general
   thing, put Lord (in small capitals) where the Hebrew has Jehovah. In
   very many cases we find passages applied to Christ as the Messiah, in
   which He is called Lord, when Lord should be Jehovah or Adonai. In Luke
   i. 76, it is said of John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, that
   he should go before the face of the Lord; but in Malachi iii. 1, of
   which this passage declares the fulfilment, the person speaking is
   Jehovah. The day of Christ, in the New Testament, is called "the day of
   the Lord;" in the Old Testament it is called "the day of Jehovah, the
   great day." yvm yhvh hgdvl. Romans x. 13, quotes Joel ii. 32, which
   speaks of Jehovah, and applies it to Christ, saying, "Whosoever shall
   call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." Rom xiv. 10, 11, quotes
   Isaiah xlv. 23, "We shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
   For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord (Jehovah), every knee
   shall bow to me," etc. This is common throughout the New Testament, and
   therefore Christ is there set forth as Lord in the same sense in which
   the Supreme God is Lord. The meaning of the word as applied to Christ
   being thus established, it shows how constant and familiar is the
   recognition of his divinity by the sacred writers. They acknowledge Him
   to be God every time they call Him Lord.

   B. Christ presented as the Object of our Religious Affections.

   Another general feature of the New Testament, intimately connected with
   the one just mentioned, and consequent upon it, is, that Christ is
   everywhere recognized as the proper object of all the religious
   affections. As He is our Lord, in the sense of being our absolute
   proprietor, our maker, preserver, and redeemer, and our sovereign,
   having the right to do with us as seems good in his sight, we are
   called upon to make Him the supreme object of our love, his will the
   highest rule of duty, and his glory the great end of our being. We are
   to exercise the same faith and confidence in Him that we do in God;
   yield Him the same obedience, devotion, and homage. We find, therefore,
   that such is the case from the beginning to the end of the New
   Testament writings. Christ is the God of the Apostles and early
   Christians, in the sense that He is the object of all their religious
   affections. They regarded Him as the person to whom they specially
   belonged; to whom they were responsible for their moral conduct; to
   whom they had to account for their sins; for the use of their time and
   talents; who was ever present with them, dwelling in them, controlling
   their inward, as well as their outward life; whose love was the
   animating principle of their being; in whom they rejoiced as their
   present joy and as their everlasting portion. This recognition of their
   relation to Christ as their God, is constant and pervading, so that the
   evidence of it cannot be gathered up and stated in a polemic or
   didactic form. But every reader of the New Testament to whom Christ is
   a mere creature, however exalted, must feel himself to be out of
   communion with the Apostles and apostolic Christians, who vowed
   themselves and were universally recognized by others as being
   worshippers of Christ. They knew that they were to stand before his
   judgment seat; that every act, thought, and word of theirs, and of
   every man who shall ever live, was to lie open to his omniscient eye;
   and that on his decision the destiny of every human soul was to depend.
   Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, they persuaded men. They
   enforced every moral duty, not merely on the grounds of moral
   obligation, but by considerations drawn from the relation of the soul
   to Christ. Children are to obey their parents, wives their husbands,
   servants their masters, not as pleasing men, but as doing the will of
   Christ. True religion in their view consists not in the love or
   reverence of God, merely as the infinite Spirit, the creator and
   preserver of all things, but in the knowledge and love of Christ.
   Whoever believes that Jesus is the Son of God, i.e., whoever believes
   that Jesus of Nazareth is God manifested in the flesh, and loves and
   obeys Him as such, is declared to be born of God. Any one who denies
   that truth, is declared to be antichrist, denying both the Father and
   the Son, for the denial of the one is the denial of the other. The same
   truth is expressed by another Apostle, who says, "If our gospel be hid
   it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the god of this world hath
   blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest they should see the
   glory of God as it shines in the face of Jesus Christ." They are lost,
   according to this Apostle, who do not see, as well as believe, Jesus to
   be God dwelling in the flesh. Hence such effects are ascribed to the
   knowledge of Christ, and to faith in Him; such hopes are entertained of
   the glory and blessedness of being with Him, as would be impossible or
   irrational if Christ were not the true God. He is our life. He that
   hath the Son hath life. He that believes on Him shall live forever. It
   is not we that live, but Christ that liveth in us. Our life is hid with
   Christ in God. We are complete in Him, wanting nothing. Though we have
   not seen Him, yet believing in Him, we rejoice in Him with joy
   unspeakable. It is because Christ is God, because He is possessed of
   all divine perfections, and because He loved us and gave Himself for
   us, and hath redeemed us and made us kings and priests unto God, that
   the Spirit of God says, "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let
   him be anathema maranatha." The denial of the divinity of the Son of
   God, the refusal to receive, love, trust, worship, and serve Him as
   such, is the ground of the hopeless condemnation of all who hear and
   reject the gospel. And to the justice of this condemnation all rational
   creatures, holy and unholy, justified or condemned, will say, Amen. The
   divinity of Christ is too plain a fact, and too momentous a truth, to
   be innocently rejected. Those are saved who truly believe it, and those
   are already lost who have not eyes to see it. He that believeth not is
   condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only
   begotten Son of God. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting
   life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the
   wrath of God abideth on him. It is the doctrine of the New Testament,
   therefore, that the spiritual apprehension and the sincere recognition
   of the Godhead of the Redeemer constitutes the life of the soul. It is
   in its own nature eternal life; and the absence or want of this faith
   and knowledge is spiritual and eternal death. Christ is our life; and
   therefore he that hath not the Son hath not life.

   C. The Relations which Christ bears to hi. People and to the World.

   As the relation which believers consciously bear to Christ is that we
   can sustain to God only, so the relation which he assumes to us, which
   He claims as belonging to him in virtue of his nature as well as of his
   work, is that which God only can sustain to rational creatures.

   His Authority as a Teacher.

   This is plain as to the authority He assumes as a teacher both of truth
   and duty. Everything which He declared to be true, all Christians have
   ever felt bound to believe, without examination and all that He
   commanded them to do or to avoid, they have ever regarded as binding
   the conscience. His authority is the ultimate and highest ground of
   faith and moral obligation. As the infinite and absolute reason dwelt
   in Him bodily, his words were the words of God. He declared himself to
   be the Truth, and therefore to question what He said was to reject the
   truth; to disobey Him was to disobey the truth. He was announced as the
   Logos, the personal and manifested Reason, which was and is the light
   of the world, -- the source of all reason and of all knowledge to
   rational creatures. Hence He spake as never man spake. He taught with
   authority. He did not do as Moses and the prophets did, speak in the
   name of God, and say, Thus saith the Lord, referring to an authority
   out of themselves. But He spoke in his own name, and the Apostles in
   the name of Christ. He was the ultimate authority. He uniformly places
   Himself in the relation of God to his people. Ye shall be saved "if ye
   do whatsoever I command you." He that heareth me heareth God. I and the
   Father are one; He in me and I in Him. Heaven and earth shall pass
   away, but my words shall never pass away. Moses said unto you thus and
   so, but I say unto you. He did not deny the divine mission of Moses,
   but He assumed the right to modify or repeal the laws which God had
   given to his people under the old economy. The whole of revealed truth
   in the Old as well as in the New Testament is referred to Him as its
   source. For the ancient prophets taught nothing but what "the Spirit of
   Christ which was in them did signify," which is equivalent to saying
   that they spake "as they were moved by the Holy Ghost;" or "that all
   Scripture is given by inspiration of God." And the Apostles presented
   themselves simply as witnesses of what Christ had taught. Paul declared
   that he received all his knowledge "by the revelation of Jesus Christ."
   And in his Epistle to the Corinthians he expresses the same truth by
   saying negatively, that his knowledge was not derived from human reason
   (the spirit that is in men), but from the Spirit of God. Nothing is
   more obvious to the reader of the New Testament than this divine
   authority as a teacher everywhere claimed by Christ and for Him. To
   disbelieve Him is to disbelieve God; and to disobey Him is to disobey
   God. This is entirely different from the authority claimed by the
   prophets and Apostles. They assumed nothing for themselves. Paul
   disclaimed all authority over the faith of God's people, except on the
   ground of the proof which he gave that it was "Christ speaking in" him.
   (2 Cor. xiii. 3.)

   His Control over all Creatures.

   The divine authority of Christ is manifest in the control which He
   claimed over all his people and over all creatures. All power was and
   is in his hands. His ministers are under his direction; He sends one
   here and another there. All Paul's labors and journeyings were
   performed under his continued guidance. This is but an illustration of
   the universal and absolute control which He constantly exercises over
   the whole universe. The angels in heaven are his messengers, and the
   course of human history, as well as the circumstances of every
   individual man, is determined by Him. So also is the eternal destiny of
   all men in his hands. I will reward every man, He says, according to
   his works. (Matt. xvi. 27, and Rev. xxii. 12.) "Many will say to me in
   that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy
   name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
   And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye
   that work iniquity." (Matt. vii. 22, 23.) In the last day, at the "time
   of harvest, I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the
   tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into
   my barn." (Matt. xiii. 30.) And in ver. 41, "The Son of Man shall send
   forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things
   that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a
   furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth." The
   king in that day will say, "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting
   fire prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was a hungered, and
   ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:" for
   "inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not
   unto me." It is the attitude, therefore, in which men stand to Christ
   (provided they have heard his name), which is to determine their
   destiny in the last day. Sinning against Christ, denying or rejecting
   Him, is denying or rejecting God. Our Lord therefore uniformly places
   Himself in the relation of God to the souls of men, claiming the same
   authority over them, the same right to decide their destiny, and
   representing all sin as committed against Himself. Thus also He says,
   that it were better for a man to have a millstone hung about his neck
   and he cast into the midst of the sea, than to offend one of the little
   ones who believe on Him. "Whosoever shall confess me before men, him
   shall the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God: but he that
   denieth me before men, shall be denied before the angels of God." (Luke
   xii. 8, 9.) "He that loveth father or mother . . . . son or daughter
   more than me is not worthy of me." Such supreme love is due to God
   alone, and Christ in claiming this love from us, places Himself before
   us as God.

   D. The Nature of his Promises.

   The same is plain from the nature of his promises. Christ promises to
   his people blessings which none but God has either the right or the
   power to bestow. He promises to forgive sin. It is intuitively certain
   that God only can forgive sin; He is our moral governor; it is against
   Him that all sin is committed, and He only has the right to remit its
   penalty. When therefore Christ says to the soul, Thy sins are forgiven,
   He exercises a divine prerogative. Even the Man of Sin, who sitteth in
   the temple of God and exalteth himself above all that is called God,
   claims no more than the judicial authority of deciding when the
   conditions of pardon at the bar of God have been fulfilled. He assumes,
   in relation to the divine law, the relation which a human judge
   sustains to the law of the land. A judge does not acquit or condemn on
   his own authority. The authority is in the state or sovereign power.
   The judge merely determines whether the grounds of condemnation are
   present or not. But as the sovereign against whom sin is committed,
   Christ has the right to pardon or to punish. Again, He promises the
   Holy Spirit. John the Baptist announced his approach as one who was to
   baptize the people with fire and with the Holy Ghost. And accordingly
   it is recorded that He did send down on his disciples, especially on
   the day of Pentecost, power from on high. It had been predicted that
   God would pour out his Spirit on all flesh; and that prophecy the
   Apostle Peter teaches was fulfilled when Christ, exalted at the right
   hand of God, shed forth his gifts on his waiting disciples. In his
   farewell discourse to the Apostles, He said, I will send you another
   Comforter, even the Spirit of truth, who shall abide with you forever.
   All the sanctifying influences, as well as all the gifts of teaching
   and of miracles which the Church has ever enjoyed, come from the Lord
   Jesus Christ. He gives the Spirit to every one severally as He will.
   "Unto every one of us, says Paul, "is given grace according to the
   measure of the gift of Christ." (Eph. iv. 7.) He promises to hear and
   answer the prayers of his people in all ages and in all parts of the
   world. "Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, I will do it." "Wherever
   two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst
   of them." "Lo I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." He
   thus promises his continued presence to his disciples wherever they may
   be. He also promises to all who believe on Him, eternal life. He has
   power to quicken or to give life to as many as He will. "My sheep
   follow me, and I give unto them eternal life." "I will raise them up at
   the last day." "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree
   of life." "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of
   life." "A crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge,
   shall give me in that day." "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give
   unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you." "Ye believe in
   God, believe also in me." "I go to prepare a place for you." "I will
   come again and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may
   be also." "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I
   will give you rest." It is obvious that the infinite God himself can
   neither promise nor give anything greater or higher than Christ gives
   his people. To Him they are taught to look as the source of all
   blessings, the giver of every good and every perfect gift. There is no
   more comprehensive prayer in the New Testament than that with which
   Paul closes his Epistle to the Galatians: "The grace of our Lord Jesus
   Christ be with your spirit." His favour is our life, which it could not
   be if He were not our God.

   E. His Control over Nature.

   A fourth general feature of the New Testament teaching concerning
   Christ, relates to the control attributed to Him over the external
   world. The laws of nature are ordained by God. They can be changed or
   suspended by Him alone. A miracle, therefore, or any event which
   involves such change or suspension, is an evidence of the immediate
   operation of divine power. The efficient agent, therefore, in working a
   miracle, must possess divine power. When Moses, the prophets, or the
   Apostles wrought miracles, they expressly disclaimed the idea that it
   was by their own efficiency. Why look ye on us, says the Apostle Peter,
   as though by our own power we had made this man whole? When Moses
   divided the Red Sea, the efficiency by which that effect was produced
   was no more in him than in the rod with which he smote the waters.
   Christ, however, wrought miracles by his own inherent power; and it was
   to his efficiency the Apostles attributed the miracles wrought through
   them. It was his name, or faith in Him, as Peter taught the people,
   which effected the instantaneous healing of the lame man. Christ never
   referred this miraculous power to any source out of Himself; He claimed
   it as his own prerogative; and He conferred the power upon others. He
   said of Himself that He had power to lay down his life and power to
   take it again; that He had life in Himself and could give life to as
   many as He pleased; I will give you, He said to his disciples, power to
   tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the
   adversary. Every miracle of Christ, therefore, was a visible
   manifestation of his divinity. When He healed the sick, opened the eyes
   of the blind, restored the lame, raised the dead, fed thousands with a
   few loaves of bread, and calmed the raging of the sea, it was by a
   word, by the effortless exercise of his will. He thus manifested forth
   his glory, giving ocular demonstration to those who had eyes to see,
   that He was God in fashion as a man. He therefore appealed directly to
   his works, "Though ye believe not me, believe the works; that ye may
   know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in Him." "If I do
   not the works of my Father, believe me not." (John x. 37, 38.) "If I
   had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had
   not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my
   Father." (John xv. 24.)

   It is only a small part of the evidence of the divinity of our Lord
   that can thus be gathered up from the general teaching of the New
   Testament. It is important to bear in mind that faith in this doctrine
   rests not on this or that passage, or on this or that mode of
   representation, but upon the whole revelation of God concerning his
   Son. The divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ is wrought into the texture
   of the Scriptures, and is everywhere asserted or assumed. There are,
   however, many passages in which the doctrine is so clearly presented,
   that they should not be passed by in any formal discussion of this
   subject.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 3. Particular Passages which Teach the Divinity of Christ.

   A. The Writings of St. John.

   John i. 1-14. Why the higher nature of Christ is called ho logos and
   why John used that designation, are different questions. As the word
   logos does not occur in Scripture in the sense of reason, it should be
   taken in its ordinary meaning. The question why the Son is called "The
   Word" may be answered by saying that the term expresses both his nature
   and his office. The word is that which reveals. The Son is the eikon
   and apaugasma of God, and therefore his word. It is his office to make
   God known to his creatures. No man hath seen God at any time; the only
   begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him.
   The Son, therefore, as the revealer of God, is the Word. The reason why
   John selected this designation of the divine nature of Christ, is not
   so easy to determine. It may indeed be said that there is ground for
   the use of the term in the usage of the Old Testament and of the Jews
   who were contemporaries with the Apostle. In the Hebrew Scriptures the
   manifested Jehovah is called the Word of God, and to Him individual
   subsistence and divine perfections are ascribed. (Ps. xxxiii. 6; cxix.
   89; Is. xl. 8; Ps. cvii. 20; cxlvii. 18.) This is more frequently done
   in the apocryphal books and in the Targums. It was not therefore an
   unusual or unknown term introduced by the Apostle John. Still as he
   only, of the New Testament writers, thus employs the word, there must
   have been some special reason for his doing so. That reason may have
   been to counteract the erroneous views concerning the nature of God and
   his Word, which had begun to prevail, and which had some support from
   the doctrines of Philo and other Alexandrian Jews. It is, however, of
   less importance to determine why John calls the Son logos, than to
   ascertain what he teaches concerning Him. He does teach (1.) That He is
   eternal. He was in the beginning; i.e., was before the creation; before
   the foundation of the world; before the world was. Compare Prov. viii.
   23; John xvii. 5, 24; Eph. i. 4. These are all Scriptural forms of
   expressing the idea of eternity. The Word then was (en), He did not
   begin to be but already was. The en of ver. 1 stands opposed to egeneto
   ver. 14. "He was the Word, and became flesh." (2.) The eternal Word
   existed in intimate union with God. "The Word was with God;" as Wisdom
   is said to have been with Him in the beginning. (Prov. viii. 30; John
   i. 18.) (3.) He was God. The word theos clearly the predicate, as it is
   without the article (compare John iv. 24, pneuma ho theos, God is a
   Spirit), and because logos is the subject in the whole context. That
   theos is neither to be taken for theios, nor rendered a God, is plain
   from what is immediately said of the logos in the following verses, and
   from the analogy of Scripture, which proves that the logos is theos the
   highest sense of the word. In this connection ho theos en o logos would
   be equivalent to saying, "The Son is the Father." Theos without the
   article occurs frequently in the New Testament when it refers to the
   supreme God. (4.) The logos is the creator of all things. All things
   were made by Him. di' autou. The dia. here does not necessarily express
   subordinate instrumentality. All things are said to be dia theou as
   well as ek theou. The Father operates through the Son and the Son
   through the Spirit. All that the preposition indicates is subordination
   as to the mode of operation, which is elsewhere taught in relation to
   the persons of the Trinity. That all creatures owe their being to the
   Word, is made the more prominent by saying, "Without him was not
   anything made that was made;" pan ho gegonen is through Him. He
   therefore cannot be a creature. He was not only before all creatures,
   but everything created was by Him caused to be. (5.) The logos is
   self-existent. He is underived. "In him was life." This is true only of
   God. The Godhead subsisting in the Father, Word, and Spirit, alone is
   self-existent, having life in itself. (6.) The life of the Word "is the
   light of men." Having life in Himself, the Word is the source of life
   in all that lives, and especially of the intellectual and spiritual
   life of man; and therefore He is said to be the light of men; i.e., the
   source of intellectual life and knowledge in all their forms. (7.) The
   logos, as the true or real light, shineth in darkness (en te skotia =
   en tois eskotismenois) in the midst of a world alienated from God. The
   men of the world, the children of darkness, do not comprehend the
   light; they do not recognize the Word as God, the creator of all
   things, and the source of life and knowledge. To those who do thus
   recognize Him, He gives power to become the sons of God, that is, He
   raises them to the dignity and blessedness of God's children. (8.) This
   Word became flesh that is, became a man. This use of the word flesh is
   explained by such passages as 1 Tim. iii. 16; Heb. ii. 14; Rom. viii.
   3, in connection with Luke i. 35; Gal. iv. 4; Phil. ii. 7. As to the
   glory of the incarnate logos, the Apostle says of himself and of his
   fellow disciples, "We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only
   begotten of the Father"; such as could belong to none other than to Him
   who is the eternal Son of God, consubstantial with the Father.

   Other Passages in St. John's Gospel.

   This introduction, which thus unmistakably sets forth the divine nature
   of Christ, is the key-note of John's Gospel, and of all his other
   writings. His main object is to convince men that Jesus is God manifest
   in the flesh, and that the acknowledgment of Him as such is necessary
   to salvation. This Apostle was, therefore, in the early Church called
   the Theologos, because he taught so clearly and earnestly that the
   logos is God. In verse 18 of this chapter he says that the Son alone
   has the knowledge of God, and is the source of that knowledge to
   others. He showed Nathanael that He knew his character, being the
   searcher of hearts. In his discourse with Nicedemus, He spoke with
   divine authority; revealing the things of heaven, because He came from
   heaven and was even then in heaven. His coming into the world was the
   highest evidence of divine love, and the salvation of all men depends
   on faith in Him; that is, on their believing that He is what He
   declared Himself to be, and trusting Him and obeying Him accordingly.
   When the Jews censured Him for healing a lame man on the Sabbath, He
   defended Himself by saying that God worked on the Sabbath; that He and
   the Father were one; that He did whatever God did; that He could give
   life to whom He willed; that all judgment was committed to Him, and
   that He was entitled to the same honour as the Father. In the sixth
   chapter He sets Himself forth as the source of life, first under the
   figure of bread, and then under that of a sacrifice. In the eighth
   chapter He declares Himself to be the light of the world. "He that
   followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of
   life." He alone could give true freedom, freedom from the condemnation
   and power of sin. He had been the only Saviour from the beginning as He
   was the object of faith to Abraham, who saw his day, and rejoiced, for
   he says, "Before Abraham was I am," thereby asserting not only his
   preexistence, but his eternity, as He declares himself to be the "I
   am," that is, the self-existing and immutable Jehovah.

   In chapter x., under the character of a shepherd, He represents Himself
   as the head of all God's people, whose voice they hear, whose steps
   they follow, and in whose care they trust. For them He lays down his
   life, and takes it again. To them He gives eternal life, and their
   salvation is certain, for no one is able to pluck them out of his
   hands; and He and the Father are one. The eleventh chapter contains the
   history of the resurrection of Lazarus, on which it maybe remarked,
   (1.) That his disciples had full confidence that Christ could deliver
   from death whom He pleased. (2.) That He claims to be the resurrection
   and the life. To all that believe on Him He is the source of spiritual
   life to the soul, and of a resurrection to the body. (3.) In
   illustration and proof of his divine power, He called Lazarus from the
   grave.

   Our Lord's Last Discourse.

   The discourse recorded in the 14th, 15th, and 16th, and the prayer
   recorded in the 17th chapter, are the words of God to men. No created
   being could speak as Christ here speaks. He begins by exhorting his
   disciples to have the same faith in Him which they had in God. He went
   to prepare heaven for them, and would return and take them to Himself.
   The knowledge of Him is the knowledge of God. He who had seen Him had
   seen the Father also; for He and the Father are one. He promised to
   send them the Holy Ghost to abide with them permanently; and that He
   would manifest Himself to them as God manifests Himself to the saints,
   revealing to them his glory and love, and making them sensible of his
   presence. He would continue to be to his Church the source of life;
   union with Him is as necessary as the union of a branch to the vine.
   The Holy Spirit sent by Him would reveal the things of Christ,
   rendering the Apostles infallible as teachers, and giving divine
   illumination to all believers. It was necessary that He should leave
   them in order to send the Spirit, who would convince the world of the
   sin of not believing Him to be all He claimed to be; of the
   righteousness of his assumption to be the Son of God and Saviour of the
   world, of which his going to the Father (i.e. resurrection) was the
   decisive proof; and also of the certainty of a future judgment,
   inasmuch as the prince of this world was already judged. The Spirit was
   to glorify Christ, i.e., to reveal Him as possessing all divine
   perfections, for whatsoever the Father hath the Son hath likewise. His
   intercessory prayer could proceed from the lips of none but a divine
   person. He speaks as one who had power over all flesh, and who could
   give eternal life to all whom God the Father had given Him. Eternal
   life consists in the knowledge of God, and of Him whom God had sent. He
   prays that He, clothed in our nature, might be glorified with the glory
   which He had before the foundation of the world; that his people might
   be sanctified; that they might be one by his dwelling in them, and that
   they might be made partakers of his glory.

   He was condemned by the Jews for claiming to be the Son of God, and by
   Pilate for claiming to be a king. When He was crucified the heavens
   were darkened, the earth trembled, the dead arose, and the vail of the
   temple was rent. By his resurrection his claim to be the Son of God and
   Saviour of men was authenticated. Thomas, not being present at the
   first interview between Christ and his disciples, doubted the fact of
   his resurrection; but when he saw Him he was fully convinced, and owned
   Him as his Lord and God. (John xx. 28.) That ho kurios mou kai ho theos
   mou is an address to Christ, and not an exclamation, is evident, (1.)
   From the words apekrithe kai eipen, he responded and said, which would
   be out of place before an exclamation. They introduce a reply to what
   Christ had said. Thomas answered that he was fully satisfied and firmly
   convinced that Christ was Lord and God. The word eipein never means to
   exclaim. (2.) Such an exclamation would be abhorrent to a Jew, who had
   even a superstitious reverence for the name of God, especially for the
   name Jehovah, and ho kurios ho theos is equivalent to yhvh 'lhym. (3.)
   The repetition of the pronoun mou also requires the passage to be
   considered as an address to Christ.

   The Epistles of St. John.

   In his epistles the Apostle John presents the divinity of Christ with
   equal prominence. The great design of those epistles was to establish
   the faith of believers in the midst of the errors which had begun to
   prevail. The chief of those errors was denial, in some form, of the
   incarnation of the Son of God. Hence the Apostle not only insists so
   strenuously on the acknowledgment that Jesus Christ had come in the
   flesh, but makes that the one great fundamental doctrine of the gospel.
   "Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in
   him, and he in God." He begins his epistles by reminding his readers
   that the Apostles had enjoyed the clearest possible evidence that the
   Logos tes zoes (He who has life and gives life) was manifest in the
   flesh. They had seen, looked upon, and handled Him. John gave believers
   this assurance in order that they might have fellowship with God and
   with his Son Jesus Christ. Many had already apostatized and denied the
   doctrine of the incarnation. To deny that doctrine, however, was to
   deny God; for whosoever denies the Son, rejects the Father also. He
   exhorts them, therefore, to abide in the Son as the only means of
   abiding in God and attaining eternal life. The tests by which they were
   to try those who professed to be inspired teachers, were, (1.) Whether
   they acknowledged the doctrine of the incarnation, i.e., of the true
   divinity and humanity of Christ. (iv. 2, 3, 15.) (2.) Conformity of
   doctrine with the teachings of the Apostles. (3.) Love to God, founded
   on his redeeming love to us, and love to the brethren, springing from
   this love to God. In chapter v. he tells his readers that the great
   truth to be believed is that Jesus is the Son of God. This is the faith
   which overcomes the world. This great truth is established by the
   testimony of God, both external and internal, for he that believeth on
   the Son of God hath the witness in himself; he that believeth not this
   testimony makes God a liar, because he believeth not the record which
   God has given of his Son. In Him is eternal life, so that he that hath
   the Son, hath life. He closes his epistle by saying: "We know that the
   Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may
   know Him that is true (i.e., that we may know the true God); and we are
   in Him that is true (i.e., the true God), even in his Son Jesus Christ.
   This (i.e., this person Jesus Christ) is the true God and eternal
   life." That this passage is to be referred to Christ, is plain. (1.)
   Because He is the subject of discourse in the context, and throughout
   the epistle. The great design of the Apostle is to tell us who and what
   Christ is. (2.) In the immediately preceding clauses he had called Him
   the true, "we are in Him that is true," even in Jesus Christ. "The
   true" and "the true God," are used as convertible expressions. (3.)
   Christ is repeatedly called "eternal life," by this Apostle, and
   "eternal life" is said to be in Him, which language is not used of God
   as such, nor of the Father. (4.) Christos is the natural antecedent of
   houtos, not only because the nearest, but because it is the prominent
   subject. (5.) This has been the received interpretation in the Church,
   at least since the Arian controversy; and the objections urged against
   it are mainly theological, rather than exegetical. It is to be remarked
   that Christ is here called not merely theos but ho theos, as in John
   xx. 28.

   The Apocalypse.

   The Book of Revelation is one continued hymn of praise to Christ,
   setting forth the glory of his person and the triumph of his kingdom;
   representing Him as the ground of confidence to his people, and the
   object of worship to all the inhabitants of heaven. He is declared to
   be the ruler of the kings of the earth. He has made us kings and
   priests unto God. He is the First and the Last, language never used but
   of God, and true of Him alone. Compare Is. xliv. 6. In the epistles to
   the seven churches, Christ assumes the titles and prerogatives of God.
   He calls Himself, He who holds the seven stars in his right hand; the
   First and the Last; He who has the sharp sword and eyes of fire, from
   which nothing can be hid. He has the seven spirits. He is the Holy and
   the True. He has the keys of David; He opens and no man shuts, and
   shuts and no man opens; his decision on the destiny of men admits of no
   appeal. He is the supreme arbiter; the faithful and true witness; the
   arche tes ktiseos tou theou, the principle, i.e., both the head and
   source, of the whole creation. He reproves the churches for their sins,
   or praises them for their fidelity, as their moral ruler against whom
   sin is committed and to whom obedience is rendered. He threatens
   punishments and promises blessings which God alone can inflict or
   bestow. In chapter v. the Apostle represents all the inhabitants of
   heaven as prostrate at the feet of Christ, ascribing blessings and
   honour and glory and power to Him that sitteth upon the throne and unto
   the Lamb forever and ever. The New Jerusalem is the seat of his
   kingdom. He is its light, glory, and blessedness. He again and again
   declares himself to be the Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last
   (i.e., the immutable and eternal), the Beginning and the End, for whose
   second coming the whole Church is in earnest expectation.

   B. The Epistles of St. Paul.

   In the epistles of Paul, the same exalted exhibition is made of the
   person and work of Christ. In the Epistle to the Romans, Christ is
   declared to be the Son of God, the object of faith, the judge of the
   world, the God of providence, the giver of the Holy Spirit, and what in
   the Old Testament is said of Jehovah, the Apostle applies to Christ. In
   chapter ix. 5, He is expressly declared to be "over all, God blessed
   forever." The text here is beyond dispute. The only method to avoid the
   force of the passage is by changing the punctuation. Erasmus, who has
   been followed by many modern interpreters, placed a full stop after
   kata sarka, or after panton. In the former case the passage would read,
   "Of whom is Christ concerning the flesh. The God who is over all be
   blessed forever;" in the latter, "Of whom Christ came concerning the
   flesh, who is above all," i.e., higher than the patriarchs. It is
   frankly admitted by the advocates of these interpretations that the
   reason for adopting them is to avoid making the Apostle assert that
   Christ is God over all. As they do not admit that doctrine, they are
   unwilling to admit that the Apostle teaches it. It was universally
   referred to Christ in the ancient Church, by all the Reformers, by all
   the older theologians, and by almost all of the modern interpreters who
   believe in the divinity of Christ. This uniformity of assent is itself
   a decisive proof that the common interpretation is the natural one. We
   are bound to take every passage of Scripture in its obvious and natural
   sense, unless the plainer declarations of the Word of God show that a
   less obvious meaning must be the true one. That the common
   interpretation of this passage is correct is plain, --

   1. Because Christ is the subject of discourse; God is not mentioned in
   the context. The Apostle is mentioning the distinguishing blessings of
   the Jewish nation. To them were given the law, the glory, the covenant,
   and the promises, and above all, from them "as concerning the flesh
   (i.e., as far as his humanity is concerned), Christ came, who is over
   all, God blessed forever." Here everything is natural and to the point.
   It shows how preeminent was the distinction of the Jews that from them
   the Messiah, God manifest in the flesh, should be born. Compared to
   this all the other prerogatives of their nation sink into
   insignificance.

   2. The words kata sarka demand an antithesis. There would be no reason
   for saying that Christ, as far as He was a man, was descended from the
   Jews, if He was not more than man, and if there were not a sense in
   which He was not descended from them. As in Rom. i. 3, 4, it is said
   that kata sarka He was the Son of David, but kata pneuma the Son of
   God; so here it is said, that kata sarka He was descended from the
   patriarchs, but that in his higher nature He is God over all, blessed
   forever.

   3. The usage of the language demands the common interpretation. In all
   exclamations and benedictions, in distinction from mere narration, the
   predicate uniformly stands before the subject, if the copula einai
   omitted. This usage is strictly observed in the Septuagint, in the
   Apocrypha, and in the New Testament. We therefore always read in such
   doxologies eulogetos ho theos, and never ho theos eulogetos. In the
   Hebrew Scriptures, vrvk occurs forty times in doxologies and formulas
   of praise before the subject. It is always "Blessed be God," and never
   "God be blessed." In the Septuagint, Psalm lxviii. 20 (19), kurios ho
   theos eulogetos is the only apparent exception to this rule. And there
   the Hebrew adheres to the common form, and the Greek version is a
   rhetorical paraphrase of the original. The Hebrew is simply vrvk 'dny
   'dny for which the LXX. have, Kurios ho theos eulogetos, culogetos
   kurios. Every consideration, therefore, is in favour of the
   interpretation which has been accepted by the Church as giving the true
   meaning of this passage. Christ is God over all, blessed forever.

   The Epistles to the Corinthians.

   In the Epistles to the Corinthians, Christ is represented, (1.) As the
   proper object of religious homage. All believers are represented as his
   worshippers. (1 Cor. i. 2.) (2.) As the source of spiritual life. (1
   Cor. i. 4-9, 30, 31.) (3.) As the Lord of all Christians and the Lord
   of glory. (1 Cor. ii. 8.) (4.) As creator of the universe (1 Cor. viii.
   6), di hou ta panta. (5.) As the Jehovah of the Old Testament, who led
   the Israelites through the wilderness. (1 Cor. x. 1-13.) (6.) As the
   giver of spiritual gifts. (1 Cor. xii.) (7.) As the Lord from heaven to
   whom the universe (ta panta) is subject. (1 Cor. xv. 25.) (8.) A
   life-giving Spirit (pneuma zoopoioun), i.e., a Spirit having life in
   Himself. and a source of life to others. (1 Cor. xv. 45.) (9.) The
   proper object of supreme love, whom not to love, justly subjects the
   soul to eternal death. (1 Cor. xvi. 22.) (10.) The object of prayer (1
   Cor. xvi. 23), from whom grace is to be sought. (11.) He gives success
   in preaching the gospel, causing his ministers to triumph. (2 Cor. ii.
   14.) (12.) The vision of his glory transforms the soul into his
   likeness. (2 Cor. iii. 17, 18.) (13.) In his face is the glory of God,
   to which those only are blind who are lost. (2 Cor. iv. 3-6.) (14.) His
   presence, or being with Him, constitutes the believers heaven. (2 Cor.
   v. 1-8.) (15.) Before his judgment-seat all men are to be arraigned. (2
   Cor. v. 10.) (16.) His love is the highest motive to action. (2 Cor. v.
   14.)

   Galatians.

   (1.) Paul says that he was an Apostle not by the will of man, but by
   Jesus Christ. (i. 1.) (2.) The conversion of the soul is effected by
   the knowledge of Christ as the Son of God. (ii. 16.) (3.) Spiritual
   life is maintained by faith of which Christ is the object. (ii. 20,
   21.) (4.) Christ lives in us, as God is said to dwell in his people.
   (ii. 20.) (5.) He was the object of Abraham's faith. (iii. 6-9.) (6.)
   He was Abraham's seed in whom all nations are blessed. (iii. 16.) (7.)
   By faith in Him we become the sons of God. (iii. 26.) (8.) The Holy
   Ghost is the Spirit of Christ. (iv. 6.) (9.) His will is our law. (vi.
   2.) (10.) His grace or favour the source of all good. (vi. 18.)

   Ephesians.

   (1.) In Christ and under Him all the objects of God's redeeming love
   are to be united in one harmonious whole. (i. 10.) (2.) In Him we have
   eternal life, or are made the heirs of God. (i. 11-14.) (3.) He is
   exalted above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion,
   i.e., above all rational creatures. (i. 21.) (4.) In Him we are
   quickened, or raised from the death of sin, made partakers of spiritual
   life, and exalted to heaven. (ii. 1-6.) (5.) In iii. 9, God is said to
   have created all things by Jesus Christ. (The text, however, in that
   passage is somewhat doubtful.) (6.) He fills the universe. (i. 23, and
   iv. 10.) (7.) He is the head of the Church, from whom it derives its
   life. (iv. 16.) (8.) He sanctifies the Church. (v. 26.) (9.) The
   discharge of all social duties is enforced by the consideration of the
   authority of Christ. We are to serve men as doing service to Him. (vi.
   1-9.)

   Philippians.

   In Philippians, besides the usual recognition of Christ as the source
   and giver of grace and peace, which comprehend all spiritual blessings,
   and the acknowledgment of Him as the end of our being (i. 21, 22), we
   have in ii. 6-11 the clearest declaration of the divinity of Christ. It
   is said, (1.) That He "was (or existed, huparchon) in the form of God,"
   i.e., was God both as to nature and manifestation. He could not be the
   one without being the other. The word morphe may mean either the mode
   of manifestation, that which appears, as when it is said "the king of
   heaven appeared on earth en morphe anthropou;" or the nature or essence
   (phusis or ousia) itself. The latter view is adopted by most of the
   fathers. The former, however, is more in accordance with the common
   usage of the word, and with the immediate context. He who existed in
   the form of God, took upon Him the form of a servant (morphen doulou),
   i.e., the real condition of a servant. (2.) He is declared to be equal
   with God. The isa einai theo he did not, consider as an harpagmon,
   i.e., an act of robbery, or an unjust assumption. He was fully entitled
   to claim equality with God. (3.) This truly divine person assumed the
   fashion of a man, which is explained by saying He was found "in the
   likeness of men." He appeared in form, carriage, language, mode of
   thinking, speaking, feeling, and acting, like other men. He was not
   purus putus homo, a mere man, but "God incarnate," God manifest in the
   flesh. (4.) This divine person, clothed in man's nature, humbled
   Himself even unto death, even to the death of the cross. (5.) Therefore
   He (not God, or the divine nature in Christ, but the Theanthropos), is
   exalted above every name that is named, "that at the name of Jesus
   (i.e., the name of the Theanthropos, as it is He as a divine person
   clothed in the nature of man, who is the object of worship), every knee
   should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under
   the earth." This is an exhaustive amplification. It includes the whole
   rational creation, from the highest archangel to the weakest saint;
   all, all that have life acknowledge Christ to be what God alone can be,
   their supreme and absolute Lord. It is because Christ is and has done
   what is represented, that the Apostle says, in the following chapter,
   that He counted all things as nothing for the knowledge of Christ, and
   that his only desire was to be found in Him and clothed in his
   righteousness. This divine Redeemer is to come again, and "shall change
   our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body,
   according to the working whereby He is able even to subdue all things
   unto Himself. (iii. 21.)

   Colossians.

   Colossians i. 15-20, is expressly designed to set forth the true
   Godhead of Christ in opposition to the errors springing from the
   emanation theory, which had already begun to prevail in the churches of
   Asia Minor. This passage sets forth the relation of Christ, first to
   God, and secondly to the universe, and thirdly to the Church. Here, as
   in so many other places of Scripture, the predicates of the Logos
   asarkos and of the Logos ensarkos, are mingled together. As in Heb. i.
   2, 3, the Son is said to have created all things, and to be the
   brightness of the Father's glory, and also to have made purification
   for sin; so here part of what is said belongs to the Logos as existing
   from eternity, and part belongs to Him as clothed in our nature. It was
   the Logos asarkos who is declared to be the image of the invisible God
   and creator of all things; and it is the Logos ensarkos who is declared
   to be the head of the Church. The relation of Christ to God, in this
   passage is expressed, (1.) By the words just quoted, "He is the image
   of the invisible God." He is so related to God that He reveals what God
   is, so that those who see Him, see God, those who know Him, know God,
   and those who hear Him, hear God. He is the brightness of God's glory,
   and his express image. (2.) His relation to God is also expressed by
   saying that He is begotten from eternity, or the only begotten Son. The
   words prototokos pases ktiseos are indeed variously explained. By
   Socinians they are made to mean that He was the head of the new
   dispensation; by Arians that He was the first created of all rational
   creatures; by many orthodox interpreters trwto, tokoj is taken in its
   secondary sense, of head or chief. They therefore understand the
   Apostle to say that Christ is the ruler or head over the whole
   creation. All these interpretations, however, are inconsistent with the
   proper meaning of the words, with the context, and with the analogy of
   Scripture. Prototokos means born before. What Christ is said to have
   been born before, is expressed by pases ktiseos. He was born (or
   begotten) before any or every creature, i.e., before creation, or from
   eternity. All the arguments adduced in a preceding chapter in proof of
   the eternal generation of the Son, are arguments in favour of this
   interpretation. Besides, the Arian interpretation is inconsistent with
   the meaning of the words. That interpretation assumes that the genitive
   pases ktiseos is to be taken partitively so that Christ is said to be a
   part of the creation, the first of creatures, as He is said to be the
   first of those who rose from the dead, when He is called prototokos ton
   nekron. But pasa ktisis does not mean the whole creation, as indicating
   the class or category to which Christ belongs, but every creature, as
   indicating a relation or comparison; Christ is the first begotten as to
   every creature, i.e., begotten before any creature (i.e., eternally,
   according to the constant usage of Scripture, for what is before
   creation is eternal.) Besides, the connection requires this
   interpretation. The Apostle proves that Christ is the image of the
   invisible God, and the prototokos pases ktiseos by an argument which
   proves that He cannot be a creature; and therefore the birth of which
   he speaks must be before time. Secondly, the relation of Christ to the
   universe is expressed in this passage by saying, (1.) That He is the
   Creator of all things. This is amplified, as the all things are
   declared to include all that are in heaven and earth, visible and
   invisible, rational and irrational, however exalted, even thrones,
   dominions, principalities, and powers; that is, the whole hierarchy of
   the spiritual world. (2.) He is not only the author but the end of the
   creation, for all things were not only created by Him, but for Him.
   (3.) He upholds all things; by Him all things consist, i.e., are
   preserved in being, life, and order. Thirdly, Christ is the head of the
   Church, the source of life and grace to all its members. For in Him
   "all fulness," the plenitude of divine blessings dwells. In chapter ii.
   3, all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge (i.e., all knowledge or
   omniscience) are said to dwell in Christ; and in ii. 9, that He is
   filled with "the fulness of the Godhead." This is very different from
   the pleroma mentioned in i. 19, where the Apostle is speaking of what
   Beza calls "cumulatissima omnium divinarum rerum copia, ex qua, tanquam
   inexhausto fonte, omnes gratiæ in corpus pro cujusque membri modulo
   deriventur;" [504] but here the reference is to the divine being,
   nature, or essence itself, to pleroma tes theotetos. The word theotes
   is abstract of theos as theiotes is of theios; the former means
   Godhead, that which makes God, God; the latter means divinity, that
   which renders divine. The entire plenitude of the divine essence (not a
   mere emanation of that essence as the rising sect of the Gnostics
   taught), dwells (katoikei permanently abides, it is no transient
   manifestation) in Him bodily, somatikos, invested with a body. The
   Godhead in its fulness is incarnate in Christ. He is therefore, not
   merely theos but ho theos in the highest sense. More than Paul says
   cannot be said.

   The Pastoral Epistles

   ln Paul's pastoral epistles to Timothy and Titus, besides the ordinary
   recognition of the divinity of Christ found in almost every page of the
   New Testament, there are four passages in which, at least according to
   the common text and the most natural interpretation, he is directly
   called God. Even 1 Tim. i. 1, kat' epitagen Theou soteros hemon kai
   Kuriou Iesou Christou, may be naturally rendered, "according to the
   command of God our Saviour, even our Lord Jesus Christ." This is in
   accordance with the parallel passages in Titus i. 3, "according to the
   commandment of God our Saviour;" and Titus ii. 13, "of the great God
   our Saviour Jesus Christ." In this latter passage there is no reason,
   as Winer and De Wette acknowledge, for questioning that Christ is
   called the great God, except what they regard as the Christology of the
   New Testament. They do not admit that Christ is the great God according
   to the doctrine of Paul, and therefore they are unwilling to admit that
   this passage contains that declaration. But if, as we have seen, and as
   the whole Church believes, not only Paul but all the Apostles and
   prophets, abundantly teach that the Messiah is truly God as well as
   truly man, there is no force in this objection. Violence must be done
   to the ordinary rules of language if tou megalou theou kai soteros are
   not referred to the same subject; inasmuch as theou has the article and
   soteros is without it. The fair meaning of the words is, "The Great God
   who is our Saviour Jesus Christ." This interpretation is also demanded,
   (1.) By the context. Jesus Christ is the subject of discourse. Of Him
   it is said that He is the great God our Saviour, who gave Himself for
   us. (2.) Because the epiphaneia, appearance (here in reference to the
   second advent), is repeatedly used in the New Testament of Christ, but
   never of God as such, or of God the Father. See 2 Tim. i. 10; 2 Thess.
   ii. 8; 1 Tim. vi. 14; 2 Tim. iv. 1, 8. (3.) The position of the words
   soteros hemon before Iesou Christou. If "God" and "Saviour" referred to
   different persons the natural order of the words would be, "The
   appearance of the great God and Jesus Christ our Saviour;" and not as
   it is, "The appearance of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ."
   Great God and Saviour obviously belong to the same person in 1 Tim. i.
   1. "The command of God our Saviour," and in Titus i. 3, "God our
   Saviour;" and in this place (Tit. ii. 13) that God and Saviour is
   declared to be Jesus Christ.

   The most important passage, however, in these pastoral epistles, is 1
   Tim. iii. 16. With regard to that passage it may be remarked, (1.) That
   it admits of two interpretations. According to the ones the Church is
   declared to be the pillar and ground of truth, according to the other,
   the pillar and ground of truth is the great mystery of godliness. The
   latter is greatly to be preferred as equally consistent with the
   grammatical structure of the passage, and as far more in harmony with
   the analogy of Scripture. The pillar and ground of truth, the great
   fundamental doctrine of the Gospel, is often elsewhere declared to be
   the doctrine of the manifestation of God in the flesh. On this doctrine
   all our hopes of salvation rest. (2.) Whatever reading be adopted,
   whether theos, hos, or ho, all of which appear in different
   manuscripts, the passage must refer to Christ. He it was who was
   manifest in the flesh, justified by the Spirit, and received up into
   glory. (3.) Whatever reading be adopted, the passage assumes or asserts
   the divinity of our Lord. With the apostolic writers, the doctrine of
   the incarnation is expressed by saying, that the logos "became flesh"
   (John i. 14); or, "Christ is come in the flesh" (1 John iv. 2); or, "He
   who is the brightness of Gods glory "took part of flesh and blood"
   (Heb. ii. 14); or, He that was "equal with God" was "found in fashion
   as a man." (Phil. ii. 8.) The same truth, therefore, is expressed,
   whether we say, "God was manifest in the flesh;" or, "He who was
   manifest in the flesh;" or, that "the mystery of godliness was manifest
   in the flesh." (4.) The external authorities are so divided that the
   most competent editors and critics differ as to what is the original
   text. For theos we find the great body of the cursive Greek manuscripts
   and almost all the Greek Fathers. The authority of the Codex
   Alexandrinus is claimed on both sides. The question there is, whether
   the letter is Th or O; some say they see distinct traces of the line in
   the Theta, others say they do not. For hos C, F, G, of the uncial
   manuscripts, only two of the cursive manuscripts, and the Coptic and
   Sahidic versions, are quoted. To this must be added the testimony of
   the very ancient manuscript recently discovered by Tischendorf the text
   of which has been published under his auspices at St. Petersburg. For
   ho the uncial manuscript D, the Latin Vulgate and the Latin Fathers are
   the witnesses. In view of this state of the question, Wetstein,
   Griesbach, Lachmann, Tischendorf, and Tregelles, among the editors,
   decide for hos. Mill, Matthies, as well as the older editors Erasmus,
   Beza, the Complutensian, and the later ones, as Knapp and Hahn, retain
   theos. [505] (5.) The internal evidence, so far as the perspicuity of
   the passage and the analogy of Scripture are concerned, are decidedly
   in favour of the common text. There is something remarkable in the
   passage; it is brought in apparently as a quotation from a hymn, as
   some think, or from a confession of faith, as others suppose, at least,
   as a familiar formula in which the leading truths concerning the
   manifestation of Christ are concisely stated. (1.) He is God. (2.) He
   was manifest in the flesh, or became man. (3.) He was justified, i.e.,
   his claims to be regarded as God manifest in the flesh were proved to
   be just, by the Spirit (i.e., either by the Holy Ghost, or by the
   pneuma or divine nature revealing itself in Him. Comp. John i. 14).
   (4.) He was seen of angels. They recognized and served Him. (5.) He was
   preached unto the Gentiles, as He came to be the Saviour of all men,
   and not of the Jews only. (6.) He was believed upon as God and Saviour;
   and (7.) He was received up into glory, where He now lives, reigns, and
   intercedes.

   Epistle to the Hebrews.

   The doctrines of the Bible are generally stated with authority;
   announced as facts to be received on the testimony of God. It is seldom
   that the sacred writers undertake to prove what they teach. The first
   chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews is an exception to this general
   rule. The divinity of Christ is here formally proved. As the design of
   the Apostle was to persuade the Hebrew Christians to adhere to the
   gospel, and to guard them from the fatal sin of apostatizing to
   Judaism, he sets before them the immeasurable superiority of the gospel
   to the Mosaic economy. The first point of that superiority, and that on
   which all the others depend, is the superior dignity of Christ as a
   divine person, to Moses and all the prophets. To set forth that
   superiority, he first asserts that Christ, the Son of God, is the
   possessor of all things; that through Him God made the world; that He
   is the brightness of God's glory, the express image of his nature,
   upholding all things by the word of his power; and that because He has
   by Himself made purification for sin, He is now, as the Theanthropos,
   set down at the right hand of the majesty on high. The true divinity of
   Christ being thus asserted, the Apostle proceeds to prove that this is
   the doctrine of the Scriptures. (1.) Because He is in the Bible called
   the Son of God, a title which cannot be given in its true sense to any
   creature. Christ, therefore, is higher than the angels; and as the word
   angels in the Bible includes all intelligent creatures higher than man,
   Christ is higher than all creatures, and therefore cannot Himself be a
   creature. He belongs to a different category of being. (2.) All angels
   (i.e., all the higher intelligences) are commanded to worship Him
   (i.e., to prostrate themselves before Him). (3.) While the angels are
   addressed as mere instruments by which God effects his purposes, the
   Son is addressed as God. "Thy throne O God is for ever and ever." (4.)
   He laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of
   his hands. (5.) They are mutable, but He is immutable and eternal. (6.)
   He is associated with God in glory and dominion. On this great truth,
   thus established, the Apostle grounds all the duties and doctrines
   which he urges on the faith and obedience of his readers. It is on this
   ground that there is no escape for those who reject the salvation which
   He has provided. (ii. 1-5.) It is on this ground also that He has a
   dominion never granted to angels, all things being made subject to Him.
   (ii. 5-10.) As it was a divine person, the eternal Son of God, who
   assumed our nature, and became a high priest for us, his sacrifice is
   efficacious, and need not be repeated; and He is a perpetual priest,
   higher than the heavens, who can save to the uttermost all who come
   unto God by Him. This Saviour is the same yesterday, to-day, and
   forever. Faith in Him will enable us to overcome the world, as faith in
   the promises concerning Christ enabled the ancient worthies to witness
   a good confession under the greatest trials and sufferings.

   The other Sacred Writers of the New Testament.

   The same testimony to the divinity of our Lord is borne by the Apostles
   James and Peter. The former calls Him the Lord of glory, the latter in
   his First Epistle represents Him as the proper object of supreme love.
   Faith in Him secures salvation. His spirit dwelt in the ancient
   prophets. He is the foundation of the Church. (ii. 6.) Having suffered
   the just for the unjust to bring us unto God, He is now exalted at the
   right hand of God, the whole universe of intelligent creatures being
   subject to Him. (iii. 18.) In his Second Epistle he speaks of the
   knowledge of Christ as the source of grace and peace (i. 2.), and of
   holiness (ver. 8). At death believers enter into his everlasting
   kingdom (ver. 11). Peter was an eyewitness of his divine majesty when
   he was with Him in the holy mount. Lord and Saviour, equivalent in the
   lips of a Jew, to Jehovah Saviour, is his common designation of Christ.
   True religion, according to this Apostle, consists in the knowledge of
   Christ as the Son of God, to whom, therefore, he ascribes eternal
   glory.

   Imperfect and unsatisfactory as this survey necessarily is, it is
   enough to prove not only that the Scriptures teach the divinity of
   Christ, but that Christianity as a religion consists in the love,
   worship, and service of the Lord Jesus, whose creatures we are, and to
   whom we belong by the still dearer relation of those whom He hath
   purchased with his own precious blood.

CHAPTER VIII.

  THE HOLY SPIRIT.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. His Nature.

   The words rvh and pneuma are used in different senses, both literal and
   figurative, in the sacred Scriptures. They properly mean wind, as when
   our Lord says, "The pneuma bloweth where it listeth;" then any
   invisible power; then immaterial, invisible agents, as the soul and
   angels; then God himself, who is said to be a Spirit, to express his
   nature as an immaterial, intelligent being; and finally, the Third
   Person of the Trinity is called "The Spirit" by way of eminence,
   probably, for two reasons. First, because He is the power or efficiency
   of God, i.e., the person through whom the efficiency of God is directly
   exercised; and secondly, to express his relation to the other persons
   of the Trinity. As Father and Son are terms expressive of relation, it
   is natural to infer that the word Spirit is to be understood in the
   same way. The Son is called the Word, as the revealer or image of God,
   and the Third Person is called Spirit as his breath or power. He is
   also predominantly called the Holy Spirit, to indicate both his nature
   and operations. He is absolutely holy in his own nature, and the cause
   of holiness in all creatures. For the same reason He is called the
   Spirit of Truth, the Spirit of Wisdom, of Peace, of Love, and of Glory.

   A. His Personality.

   The two points to be considered in reference to this subject, are,
   first the nature, and second the office or work of the Holy Spirit.
   With regard to his nature, is He a person or a mere power? and if a
   person, is He created or divine, finite or infinite? The personality of
   the Spirit has been the faith of the Church from the beginning. It had
   few opponents even in the chaotic period of theology and in modern
   times has been denied by none but Socinians, Arians, and Sabellians.
   Before considering the direct proof of the Church doctrine that the
   Holy Spirit is a person, it may be well to remark, that the terms "The
   Spirit," "The Spirit of God," "The Holy Sprit," and when God speaks,
   "My Spirit," or, when God is spoken of "His Spirit," occur in all parts
   of Scripture from Genesis to Revelation. These and equivalent terms are
   evidently to be understood in the same sense throughout the Scriptures.
   If the Spirit of God which moved on the face of the waters, which
   strove with the antediluvians, which came upon Moses, which gave skill
   to artisans, and which inspired the prophets, is the power of God; then
   the Spirit which came upon the Apostles, which Christ promised to send
   as a comforter and advocate, and to which the instruction,
   sanctification, and guidance of the people of God are referred, must
   also be the power of God. But if the Spirit is clearly revealed to be a
   person in the later parts of Scripture, it is plain that the earlier
   portions must be understood in the same way. One part of the Bible, and
   much less one or a few passages must not be taken by themselves, and
   receive any interpretation which the isolated words may bear, but
   Scripture must interpret Scripture. Another obvious remark on this
   subject is, that the Spirit of God is equally prominent in all parts of
   the word of God. His intervention does not occur on rare occasions, as
   the appearance of angels, or the Theophanies, of which mention is made
   here and there in the sacred volume; but He is represented as
   everywhere present and everywhere operative. We might as well strike
   from the Bible the name and doctrine of God, as the name and office of
   the Spirit. In the New Testament alone He is mentioned not far from
   three hundred times. It is not only, however, merely the frequency with
   which the Spirit is mentioned, and the prominence given to his person
   and work, but the multiplied and interesting relations in which He is
   represented as standing to the people of God, the importance and number
   of his gifts, and the absolute dependence of the believer and of the
   Church upon Him for spiritual and eternal life, which render the
   doctrine of the Holy Ghost absolutely fundamental to the gospel. The
   work of the Spirit in applying the redemption of Christ is represented
   to be as essential as that redemption itself. It is therefore
   indispensable that we should know what the Bible teaches concerning the
   Holy Ghost, both as to his nature and office.

   Proof of his Personality.

   The Scriptures clearly teach that He is a person. Personality includes
   intelligence, will, and individual subsistence. If, therefore, it can
   be proved that all these are attributed to the Spirit, it is thereby
   proved that He is a person. It will not be necessary or advisable to
   separate the proofs of these several points, and cite passages which
   ascribe to Him intelligence; and then others which attribute to Him
   will; and still others to prove his individual subsistence, because all
   these are often included in one and the same passage; and arguments
   which prove the one, in many cases prove also the others.

   1. The first argument for the personality of the Holy Spirit is derived
   from the use of the personal pronouns in relation to Him. A person is
   that which, when speaking, says I; when addressed, is called thou; and
   when spoken of, is called he, or him. It is indeed admitted that there
   is such a rhetorical figure as personification; that inanimate or
   irrational beings, or sentiments, or attributes, may be introduced as
   speaking, or addressed as persons. But this creates no difficulty. The
   cases of personification are such as do not, except in rare instances,
   admit of any doubt. The fact that men sometimes apostrophize the
   heavens, or the elements, gives no pretext for explaining as
   personification all the passages in which God or Christ is introduced
   as a person. So also with regard to the Holy Spirit. He is introduced
   as a person so often, not merely in poetic or excited discourse, but in
   simple narrative, and in didactic instructions; and his personality is
   sustained by so many collateral proofs, that to explain the use of the
   personal pronouns in relation to Him on the principle of
   personification, is to do violence to all the rules of interpretation.
   Thus in Acts xiii. 2, "The Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and
   Saul, for the work whereunto I have called them." Our Lord says (John
   xv. 26), "When the Comforter (ho parakletos) is come whom I will send
   unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth (to pneuma tes
   aletheias) which (ho) proceedeth from the Father, He (ekeinos) shall
   testify of me." The use of the masculine pronoun He instead of it,
   shows that the Spirit is a person. It may indeed be said that as
   parakletos is masculine, the pronoun referring to it must of course be
   in the same gender. But as the explanatory words to pneuma intervene,
   to which the neuter ho refers, the following pronoun would naturally be
   in the neuter, if the subject spoken of, the pneuma, were not a person.
   In the following chapter (John xvi. 13, 14) there is no ground for this
   objection. It is there said, "When He (evkei/noj), the Spirit of truth,
   is come, He will guide you into all truth: for He shall not speak of
   Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak, and He will
   show you things to come. He shall glorify me (ekeinos eme doxasei): for
   He shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you." Here there is no
   possibility of accounting for the use of the personal pronoun He
   (ekeinos) on any other ground than the personality of the Spirit.

   2. We stand in relations to the Holy Spirit which we can sustain only
   to a person. He is the object of our faith. We believe on the Holy
   Ghost. This faith we profess in baptism. We are baptized not only in
   the name of the Father and of the Son, but also of the Holy Ghost. The
   very association of the Spirit in such a connection, with the Father
   and the Son, as they are admitted to be distinct persons, proves that
   the Spirit also is a person. Besides the use of the word eis to onoma,
   unto the name, admits of no other explanation. By baptism we profess to
   acknowledge the Spirit as we acknowledge the Father and the Son, and we
   bind ourselves to the one as well as to the others. If when the Apostle
   tells the Corinthians that they were not baptized eis to onoma Paulou,
   and when he says that the Hebrews were baptized unto Moses, he means
   that the Corinthians were not, and that the Hebrews were made the
   disciples, the one of Paul and the others of Moses; then when we are
   baptized unto the name of the Spirit, the meaning is that in baptism we
   profess to be his disciples; we bind ourselves to receive his
   instructions, and to submit to his control. We stand in the same
   relation to Him as to the Father and to the Son; we acknowledge Him to
   be a person as distinctly as we acknowledge the personality of the Son,
   or of the Father. Christians not only profess to believe on the Holy
   Ghost, but they are also the recipients of his gifts. He is to them an
   object of prayer. In the apostolic benediction, the grace of Christ,
   the love of the Father, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, are
   solemnly invoked. We pray to the Spirit for the communication of
   Himself to us, that He may, according to the promise of our Lord, dwell
   in us, as we pray to Christ that we may be the objects of his unmerited
   love. Accordingly we are exhorted not "to sin against," "not to
   resist," not "to grieve" the Holy Spirit. He is represented, therefore,
   as a person who can be the object of our acts; whom we may please or
   offend; with whom we may have communion, i.e., personal intercourse;
   who can love and be loved; who can say "thou" to us; and whom we can
   invoke in every time of need.

   3. The Spirit also sustains relations to us, and performs offices which
   none but a person can sustain or perform. He is our teacher,
   sanctifier, comforter, and guide. He governs every believer who is led
   by the Spirit, and the whole Church. He calls as He called Barnabas and
   Saul, to the work of the ministry, or to some special field of labour.
   Pastors or bishops are made overseers by the Holy Ghost.

   4. In the exercise of these and other functions, personal acts are
   constantly attributed to the Spirit in the Bible; that is, such acts as
   imply intelligence, will, and activity or power. The Spirit searches,
   selects, reveals, and reproves. We often read that "The Spirit said."
   (Acts xiii. 2; xxi. 11; 1 Tim. iv. 1, etc., etc.) This is so constantly
   done, that the Spirit appears as a personal agent from one end of the
   Scriptures to the other, so that his personality is beyond dispute. The
   only possible question is whether He is a distinct person from the
   Father. But of this there can be no reasonable doubt, as He is said to
   be the Spirit of God and the Spirit which is of God (ek theou);as He is
   distinguished from the Father in the forms of baptism and benediction;
   as He proceeds from the Father; and as He is promised, sent, and given
   by the Father. So that to confound the Holy Spirit with God would be to
   render the Scriptures unintelligible.

   5. All the elements of personality, namely, intelligence, will, and
   individual subsistence, are not only involved in all that is thus
   revealed concerning the relation in which the Spirit stands to us and
   that which we sustain to Him, but they are all distinctly attributed to
   Him. The Spirit is said to know, to will, and to act. He searches, or
   knows all things, even the deep things of God. No man knoweth the
   things of God, but the Spirit of God. (1 Cor. ii. 10, 12.) He
   distributes "to every man severally as he will." (1 Cor. xii. 11.) His
   individual subsistence is involved in his being an agent, and in his
   being the object on which the activity of others terminates. If He can
   be loved, reverenced, and obeyed, or offended and sinned against, He
   must be a person.

   6. The personal manifestations of the Spirit, when He descended on
   Christ after his baptism, and upon the Apostles at the day of
   Pentecost, of necessity involve his personal subsistence. It was not
   any attribute of God, nor his mere efficiency, but God himself, that
   was manifested in the burning bush, in the fire and clouds on Mount
   Sinai, in the pillar which guided the Israelites through the
   wilderness, and in the glory which dwelt in the Tabernacle and in the
   Temple.

   7. The people of God have always regarded the Holy Spirit as a person.
   They have looked to Him for instruction, sanctification, direction, and
   comfort. This is part of their religion. Christianity (subjectively
   considered) would not be what it is without this sense of dependence on
   the Spirit, and this love and reverence for his person. All the
   liturgies, prayers, and praises of the Church, are filled with appeals
   and addresses to the Holy Ghost. This is a fact which admits of no
   rational solution if the Scriptures do not really teach that the Spirit
   is a distinct person. The rule Quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab
   omnibus, is held by Protestants as well as by Romanists. It is not to
   the authority of general consent as an evidence of truth, that
   Protestants object, but to the applications made of it by the Papal
   Church, and to the principle on which that authority is made to rest.
   All Protestants admit that true believers in every age and country have
   one faith, as well as one God and one Lord.

   B. Divinity of the Holy Spirit.

   On this subject there has been little dispute in the Church. The Spirit
   is so prominently presented in the Bible as possessing divine
   attributes, and exercising divine prerogatives, that since the fourth
   century his true divinity has never been denied by those who admit his
   personality.

   1. In the Old Testament, all that is said of Jehovah is said of the
   Spirit of Jehovah; and therefore, if the latter is not a mere
   periphrase for the former, he must of necessity be divine. The
   expressions, Jehovah said, and, the Spirit said, are constantly
   interchanged; and the acts of the Spirit are said to be acts of God.

   2. In the New Testament, the language of Jehovah is quoted as the
   language of the Spirit. In Is. vi. 9, it is written, Jehovah said, "Go
   and tell this people," etc. This passage is thus quoted by Paul, Acts
   xxviii. 25, "Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet," etc. In
   Jeremiah xxxi. 31, 33, 34, it is said, "Behold the days come, saith
   Jehovah, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel;"
   which is quoted by the Apostle in Heb. x. 15, saying, "Whereof the Holy
   Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that He had said before, This
   is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the
   Lord; I will put my laws into their hearts," etc. Thus constantly the
   language of God is quoted as the language of the Holy Ghost. The
   prophets were the messengers of God; they uttered his words, delivered
   his commands, pronounced his threatenings, and announced his promises,
   because they spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. They were the
   organs of God, because they were the organs of the Spirit. The Spirit,
   therefore, must be God.

   3. In the New Testament the same mode of representation is continued.
   Believers are the temple of God, because the Spirit dwells in them.
   Eph. ii. 22: Ye are "a habitation of God through the Spirit." 1 Cor.
   vi. 19: "Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost
   which is in you, which ye have of God?" In Rom. viii. 9, 10, the
   indwelling of Christ is said to be the indwelling of the Spirit of
   Christ, and that is said to be the indwelling of the Spirit of God. In
   Acts v. 1-4, Ananias is said to have lied unto God because he lied
   against the Holy Ghost.

   4. Our Lord and his Apostles constantly speak of the Holy Spirit as
   possessing all divine perfections. Christ says, "All manner of sin and
   blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the
   Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men." (Matt. xii. 31.) The
   unpardonable sin, then, is speaking against the Holy Ghost. This could
   not be unless the Holy Ghost were God. The Apostle, in 1 Cor. ii. 10,
   11, says that the Spirit knows all things, even the deep things (the
   most secret purposes) of God. His knowledge is commensurate with the
   knowledge of God. He knows the things of God as the spirit of a man
   knows the things of a man. The consciousness of God is the
   consciousness of the Spirit. The Psalmist teaches us that the Spirit is
   omnipresent and everywhere efficient. "Whither," he asks, "shall I go
   from thy Spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?" (Ps.
   cxxxix. 7.) The presence of the Spirit is the presence of God. The same
   idea is expressed by the prophet when he says, "Can any hide himself in
   secret places that I shall not see him? saith Jehovah. Do not I fill
   heaven and earth? saith Jehovah." (Jer. xxiii. 24.)

   5. The works of the Spirit are the works of God. He fashioned the
   world. (Gen. i. 2.) He regenerates the soul: to be born of the Spirit
   is to be born of God. He is the source of all knowledge; the giver of
   inspiration; the teacher, the guide, the sanctifier, and the comforter
   of the Church in all ages. He fashions our bodies; He formed the body
   of Christ, as a fit habitation for the fulness of the Godhead; and He
   is to quicken our mortal bodies. (Rom. viii. 11.)

   6. He is therefore presented in the Scriptures as the proper object of
   worship, not only in the formula of baptism and in the apostolic
   benediction, which bring the doctrine of the Trinity into constant
   remembrance as the fundamental truth of our religion, but abo in the
   constant requirement that we look to Him and depend upon Him for all
   spiritual good, and reverence and obey Him as our divine teacher and
   sanctifier.

   Relation of the Spirit to the Father and to the Son.

   The relation of the Spirit to the other persons of the Trinity has been
   stated before. (1.) He is the same in substance and equal in power and
   glory. (2.) He is subordinate to the Father and Son, as to his mode of
   subsistence and operation, as He is said to be of the Father and of the
   Son; He is sent by them, and they operate through Him. (3.) He bears
   the same relation to the Father as to the Son; as He is said to be of
   the one as well as of the other, and He is given by the Son as well as
   by the Father. (4.) His eternal relation to the other persons of the
   Trinity is indicated by the word Spirit, and by its being said that he
   is ek toi theou, out of God, i.e., God is the source whence the Spirit
   is said to proceed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 2. The Office of the Holy Spirit.

   A. In Nature.

   The general doctrine of the Scriptures on this subject is that the
   Spirit is the executive of the Godhead. Whatever God does, He does by
   the Spirit. Hence in the creed of Constantinople, adopted by the Church
   universal, He is said to be to Pneuma, to kurion, to zoopoion. He is
   the immediate source of all life. Even in the external world the Spirit
   is everywhere present and everywhere active. Matter is not intelligent.
   It has its peculiar properties, which act blindly according to
   established laws. The intelligence, therefore, manifested in vegetable
   and animal structures, is not to he referred to matter, but to the
   omnipresent Spirit of God. It was He who brooded over the waters and
   reduced chaos into order. It was He who garnished the heavens. It is He
   that causes the grass to grow. The Psalmist says of all living
   creatures, "Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away
   their breath, they die, and return to their dust. Thou sendest forth
   thy Spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth."
   (Ps. civ. 29, 30.) Compare Is. xxxii. 14, 15. Job, speaking of his
   corporeal frame, says, "The Spirit of God hath made me." (Job xxxiii.
   4.) And the Psalmist, after describing the omnipresence of the Spirit
   refers to his agency the wonderful mechanism of the human body. "I am
   fearfully and wonderfully made . . . . my substance was not hid from
   thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest
   parts of the earth. Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being
   unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in
   continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them." (Ps.
   cxxxix. 14-16.) Cyprian (or the author of the Tract "De Spiritu
   Sancto," included in his works) says, "Hic Spiritus Sanctus ab ipso
   mundi initio aquis legitur superfusus; non materialibus aquis quasi
   vehiculo egens, quas potius ipse ferebat et complectentibus firmamentum
   dabat con gruum motum et limitem præfinitum. . . . [Hic est] spiritus
   vitæ cujus vivificus calor animat omnia et fovet et provehit et
   foecundat. Hic Spiritus Sanctus omnium viventium anima, ita largitate
   sua se omnibus abundanter infundit, ut habeant omnia rationabilia et
   irrationabilia secundum genus suum ex eo quod sunt et quod in suo
   ordine suæ naturæ competentia agunt. Non quod ipse sit substantialis
   anima singulis, sed in se singulariter manens, de plenitudine sua
   distributor magnificus proprias efficientias singulis dividit et
   largitur; et quasi sol omnia calefaciens, subjecta omnia nutrit, et
   absque ulla sui diminutione, integritatem suam de inexhausta
   abundantia, quod satis est, et sufficit omnibus, commodat et impartit."
   [506]

   The Spirit the Source of all Intellectual Life.

   The Spirit is also represented as the source of all intellectual life.
   When man was created it is said God "breathed into his nostrils the
   breath of life; and man became (nphs chyh) a living soul." (Gen. ii.
   7.) Job xxxii. 8, says, The inspiration of the Almighty giveth men
   understanding, i.e., a rational nature, for it is explained by saying,
   He "teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser
   than the fowls of heaven." (Job xxxv. 11.) The Scriptures ascribe in
   like manner to Him all special or extraordinary gifts. Thus it is said
   of Bezaleel, "I have called" him, "and I have filed him with the Spirit
   of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all
   manner of workmanship, to devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in
   silver, and in brass." (Ex. xxxi. 2, 3, 4.) By his Spirit God gave
   Moses the wisdom requisite for his high duties, and when he was
   commanded to devolve part of his burden upon the seventy elders, it was
   said, "I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it
   upon them." (Num. xi. 17.) Joshua was appointed to succeed Moses,
   because in him was the Spirit. (Num. xxvii. 18.) In like manner the
   Judges, who from time to time were raised up, as emergency demanded,
   were qualified by the Spirit for their peculiar work, whether as rulers
   or as warriors. Of Othniel it is said, "The Spirit of the Lord came
   upon him, and he judged Israel and went out to war." (Judges iii. 10.)
   So the Spirit of the Lord is said to have come upon Gideon and on
   Jephthah and on Samson. When Saul offended God, the Spirit of the Lord
   is said to have departed from him. (1 Sam. xvi. 14.) When Samuel
   anointed David, "The Spirit of the Lord came upon" him "from that day
   forward." (1 Sam. xvi. 13.) In like manner under the new dispensation
   the Spirit as represented as not only the author of miraculous gifts,
   but also as the giver of the qualifications to teach and rule in the
   Church. All these operations are independent of the sanctifying
   influences of the Spirit. When the Spirit came on Samson or upon Saul,
   it was not to render them holy, but to endue them with extraordinary
   physical and intellectual power; and when He is said to have departed
   from them, it means that those extraordinary endowments were withdrawn.

   B. The Spirits Office in the Work of Redemption.

   With regard to the office of the Spirit in the work of redemption, the
   Scriptures teach, --

   1. That He fashioned the body, and endued the human soul of Christ with
   every qualification for his work. To the Virgin Mary it was said, "The
   Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall
   overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of
   thee, shall be called the Son of God." (Luke i. 35.) The prophet Isaiah
   predicted that the Messiah should be replenished with all spiritual
   gifts. "Behold my servant whom I uphold; mine elect in whom my soul
   delighteth; I have put my Spirit upon him: he shall bring forth
   judgment to the Gentiles." (Is. xlii. 1.) "There shall come forth a rod
   out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots: and
   the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and
   understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge
   and of the fear of the Lord." (Is. xi. 1, 2.) When our Lord appeared on
   earth, it is said that the Spirit without measure was given unto Him.
   (John iii. 34.) "And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit
   descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him." (John i.
   32.) He was, therefore, said to have been full of the Holy Ghost.

   2. That the Spirit is the revealer of all divine truth. The doctrines
   of the Bible are called the things of the Spirit. With regard to the
   writers of the Old Testament, it is said they spake as they were moved
   by the Holy Ghost. The language of Micah is applicable to all the
   prophets, "Truly I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord, and of
   judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression and to
   Israel his sin." (Micah iii. 8.) What David said, the Holy Ghost is
   declared to have said. The New Testament writers were in like manner
   the organs of the Spirit. The doctrines which Paul preached he did not
   receive from men "but God," he says, "hath revealed them unto us by his
   Spirit." (1 Cor. ii. 10.) The Spirit also guided the utterance of those
   truths; for he adds, "Which things also we speak, not in the words
   which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth;
   communicating the things of the Spirit in the words of the Spirit"
   (pneumatikois pneumatika sunkrinontes). The whole Bible, therefore, is
   to be referred to the Spirit as its author.

   3. The Spirit not only thus reveals divine truth, having guided
   infallibly holy men of old in recording it, but He everywhere attends
   it by his power. All truth is enforced on the heart and conscience with
   more or less power by the Holy Spirit, wherever that truth is known. To
   this all-pervading influence we are indebted for all there is of
   morality and order in the world. But besides this general influence,
   which is usually called common grace, the Spirit specially illuminates
   the minds of the children of God, that they may knew the things freely
   given (or revealed to them) by God. The natural man does not receive
   them, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
   All believers are therefore called (pneumatikoi) spiritual, because
   thus enlightened and guided by the Spirit.

   4. It is the special office of the Spirit to convince the world of sin;
   to reveal Christ, to regenerate the soul, to lead men to the exercise
   of faith and repentance; to dwell in those whom He thus renews, as a
   principle of a new and divine life. By this indwelling of the Spirit,
   believers are united to Christ, and to one another, so that they form
   one body. This is the foundation of the communion of saints, making
   them one in faith, one in love, one in their inward life, and one in
   their hopes and final destiny.

   5. The Spirit also calls men to office in the Church, and endows them
   with the qualifications necessary for the successful discharge of its
   duties. The office of the Church, in this matter, is simply to
   ascertain and authenticate the call of the Spirit. Thus the Holy Ghost
   is the immediate author of all truth, of all holiness, of all
   consolation, of all authority, and of all efficiency in the children of
   God individually, and in the Church collectively.

   § 3. History of the Doctrine concerning the Holy Spirit.

   During the Ante-Nicene period, the Church believed concerning the Holy
   Ghost what was revealed on the surface of Scripture, and what was
   involved in the religious experience of all Christians. There is to
   them one God, the Father, whose favour they had forfeited by sin, and
   to whom they must be reconciled: one Lord Jesus Christ, the only
   begotten Son of God, through whom this reconciliation is effected; and
   one Holy Spirit, by whom they are, through Christ, brought near to God.
   This all Christians believed, as they professed in their baptism, and
   in repeating and receiving the apostolic benediction. With this simple
   faith underlying and sustaining the life of the Church, there coexisted
   among theologians great obscurity, indistinctness, and inconsistency of
   statement, especially in reference to the nature and office of the Holy
   Ghost. This ought not to be a matter of surprise, because in the
   Scriptures themselves the same work is often ascribed to God and to the
   Spirit of God, which led some at times to assume that these terms
   expressed one and the same thing; as the spirit of a man is the man
   himself. In the Scriptures, also, the terms Word and Breath (or Spirit)
   are often interchanged; and what in one place is said to be done by the
   Word, in another is said to be done by the Spirit. The Logos is
   represented as the life of the world and the source of all knowledge,
   and yet the same is said of the Spirit. Paul declares in one place
   (Gal. i. 12) that he received the doctrines which he taught, by the
   revelation of Jesus Christ; in another (1 Cor. ii. 10), that he was
   taught them by the Spirit. Misled by such representation, some of the
   fathers identified the Son and Spirit. Even Tertullian, in one place
   says, "Spiritus substantia est Sermonis, et Sermo operatio Spiritus, et
   duo unum sunt." [507] Finally, as it is plain from the Scripture that
   the Spirit is of the Son, as the Son is of the Father (the difference
   between generation and procession being perfectly inscrutable), all the
   Arians and semi-Arians who taught that the Son was created by the
   Father, held that the Spirit was created by the Son. This roused so
   much controversy and agitation, that first the Council of Nice, A.D.
   325, and then that of Constantinople, A.D. 381, were called to frame a
   satisfactory statement of the Scriptural doctrine on this subject. In
   the Creed of the Apostles, as it is called, which is so ancient that
   Rufinus and Ambrose referred it to the Apostles themselves, it is
   simply said, "I believe on the Holy Ghost." The same words without
   addition are repeated in the Nicene Creed, but in the Creed of
   Constantinople it is added, "I believe in the Holy Ghost, the divine
   (to kurion), the life-giving, who proceedeth from the Father, who is to
   be worshipped and glorified with the Father and the Son, and who spake
   through the prophets." In the Athanasian Creed (so-called), it is said
   that the Spirit is consubstantial with the Father and the Son; that He
   is uncreated, eternal, and omnipotent, equal in majesty and glory, and
   that He proceeds from the Father and the Son. These creeds are
   Catholic, adopted by the whole Church. Since they were framed there has
   been no diversity of faith on this subject among those recognized as
   Christians.

   Those who, since the Council of Constantinople have denied the common
   Church doctrine, whether Socinians, Arians, or Sabellians, regard the
   Holy Spirit not as a creature, but as the power of God, i.e., the
   manifested divine efficiency. The modern philosophical theologians of
   Germany do not differ essentially from this view. De Wette, for
   example, says, that the Spirit is God as revealed and operative in
   nature; Schleiermacher says the term designates God as operative in the
   Church, i.e., "der Gemeingeist der Kirche." This, however, is only a
   name. God with Schleiermacher is only the unity of the causality
   manifested in the world. That causality viewed in Christ we may call
   Son, and viewed in the Church we may call the Spirit. God is merely
   cause, and man a fleeting effect. Happily Schleiermacher's theology and
   Schleiermacher's religion were as different as the speculations and the
   every day faith of the idealist.

CHAPTER IX.

  THE DECREES OF GOD.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. The Nature of the Decrees.

   It must be remembered that theology is not philosophy. It does not
   assume to discover truth, or to reconcile what it teaches as true with
   all other truths. Its province is simply to state what God has revealed
   in his Word, and to vindicate those statements as far as possible from
   misconceptions and objections. This limited and humble office of
   theology it is especially necessary to bear in mind, when we come to
   speak of the acts and purposes of God. "The things of God knoweth no
   man; but the Spirit of God." (1 Cor. ii. 11.) In treating, therefore,
   of the decrees of God, all that is proposed is simply to state what the
   Spirit has seen fit to reveal on that subject.

   "The decrees of God are his eternal purpose, according to the counsel
   of his will, whereby for his own glory He hath foreordained whatsoever
   comes to pass." [508] Agreeably to this statement: (1.) The end or
   final cause contemplated in all God's decrees, is his own glory. (2.)
   They are all reducible to one eternal purpose. (3.) They are free and
   sovereign, determined by the counsel of his own will. (4.) They
   comprehend all events.

   A. The Glory of God the Final Cause of all his Decrees.

   The final cause of all God's purposes is his own glory. This is
   frequently declared to be the end of all things. "Thou art worthy," say
   the heavenly worshippers, "O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and
   power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are
   and were created." (Rev. iv. 11.) All things are said to be not only of
   God and through Him, but for Him. He is the beginning and the end. The
   heavens declare his glory; that is the purpose for which they were
   made. God frequently announces his determination to make his glory
   known. "As truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the
   glory of the Lord." (Num. xiv. 21.) This is said to be the end of all
   the dispensations of his providence, whether beneficent or punitive.
   "For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it; for how
   should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another."
   (Is. xlviii. 11.) "I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be
   polluted before the heathen." (Ezek. xx. 9.) In like manner the whole
   plan of redemption and the dispensations of his grace, are declared to
   be designed to reveal the glory of God. (1 Cor. i. 26-31; Eph. ii.
   8-10.) This is the end which our Lord proposed to Himself. He did
   everything for the glory of God; and for this end all his followers are
   required to live and act. As God is infinite, and all creatures are as
   nothing in comparison with Him, it is plain that the revelation of his
   nature and perfections must be the highest conceivable end of all
   things, and the most conducive to secure all other good subordinate
   ends. Order and truth, however, depend on things being put in their
   right relations. If we make the good of the creature the ultimate
   object of all God's works, then we subordinate God to the creature, and
   endless confusion and unavoidable error are the consequence. It is
   characteristic of the Bible that it places God first, and the good of
   the creation second. This also is the characteristic feature of
   Augustinianism as distinguished from all other forms of doctrine. And
   when the Protestants were divided at the time of the Reformation, it
   was mainly on this point. The Lutheran and Reformed churches are
   distinguished in all that characterizes their theological systems, by
   the fact that the latter allow the supremacy and sovereignty of God in
   the workings of his providence and grace to determine everything for
   his own glory, while the former lean more or less to the error of
   restraining God's liberty of action by the assumed powers and
   prerogatives of man. The Bible, Augustine, and the Reformed, give one
   answer to all such questions as the following: Why did God create the
   world? Why did He permit the occurrence of sin? Why was salvation
   provided for men and not for angels? Why was the knowledge of that
   salvation so long confined to one people? Why among those who hear the
   gospel, do some receive, and others reject it? To all these, and
   similar questions, the answer is, not because the happiness of
   creatures would be secured in a higher degree by the admission of sin
   and misery, than by their entire exclusion; some men are saved and
   others perish not because some of their own will believe and others do
   not believe, but simply because, Thus it seemed good in the eyes of
   God. Whatever He does or permits to be done, is done or permitted for
   the more perfect revelation of his nature and perfections. As the
   knowledge of God is the ground and sum of all good, it of course
   follows that the more perfectly God is known, the more fully the
   highest good (not merely nor necessarily the highest happiness) of the
   intelligent universe is promoted. But this is a subordinate effect, and
   not the chief end. It is therefore in accordance with the whole spirit
   and teachings of the Bible, and with the essential character of
   Augustinianism, that our standards make the glory of God the end of all
   his decrees.

   B. The Decrees Reducible to one Purpose.

   The second point included in this doctrine is, that the decrees of God
   are all reducible to one purpose. By this is meant that from the
   indefinite number of systems, or series of possible events, present to
   the divine mind, God determined on the futurition or actual occurrence
   of the existing order of things, with all its changes, minute as well
   as great, from the beginning of time to all eternity. The reason,
   therefore, why any event occurs, or, that it passes from the category
   of the possible into that of the actual, is that God has so decreed.
   The decrees of God, therefore, are not many, but one purpose. They are
   not successively formed as the emergency arises, but are all parts of
   one all-comprehending plan. This view of the subject is rendered
   necessary by the nature of an infinitely perfect Being. It is
   inconsistent with the idea of absolute perfection, that the purposes of
   God are successive, or that He ever purposes what He did not originally
   intend; or that one part of his plan is independent of other parts. It
   is one scheme, and therefore one purpose. As, however, this one purpose
   includes an indefinite number of events, and as those events are
   mutually related, we therefore speak of the decrees of God as many, and
   as having a certain order. The Scriptures consequently speak of the
   judgments, counsels or purposes of God, in the plural number, and also
   of his determining one event because of another. When we look at an
   extensive building, or a complicated machine, we perceive at once the
   multiplicity of their parts, and their mutual relations. Our conception
   of the building or of the machine is one, and yet it comprehends many
   distinct perceptions, and the apprehension of their relations. So also
   in the mind of the architect or mechanist, the whole is one idea,
   though he intends many things, and one in reference to another. We can,
   therefore, in a measure, understand how the vast scheme of creation,
   providence, and redemption, lies in the divine mind as one simple
   purpose, although including an infinite multiplicity of causes and
   effects.

   C. The Decrees of God are Eternal.

   That the decrees of God are eternal, necessarily follows from the
   perfection of the divine Being. He cannot be supposed to have at one
   time plans or purposes which He had not at another. He sees the end
   from the beginning; the distinctions of time have no reference to him
   who inhabits eternity. The Scriptures therefore always speak of events
   in time as revelations of a purpose formed in eternity. The salvation
   of men, for example, is said to be "according to the eternal purpose
   which He purposed in Christ Jesus." (Eph. iii. 11.) What is revealed in
   time was hidden for ages, i.e., from eternity in the mind of God. (Eph.
   iii. 9.) Believers were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the
   world. (Eph. i. 4.) "Who hath saved us, and called us . . . . according
   to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus, pro
   chronon aionion, before eternal ages." (2 Tim. i. 9.) Christ as a
   sacrifice was "foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was
   manifest in these last times for you, who by Him do believe in God." (1
   Pet. i. 20, 21; Rom. xi. 33-36; Acts ii. 23.) This is the constant
   representation of Scripture. History in all its details, even the most
   minute, is but the evolution of the eternal purposes of God. It is no
   objection to this doctrine that the Scriptures often represent one
   purpose of God as consequent upon another, or that they speak of his
   purposes as determined by the conduct of men. The language of Scripture
   is founded on apparent truth; they speak, as men always do, as things
   appear, not as they themselves know or believe them to be. We speak of
   the concave heavens, or of the firm foundation of the heavens, although
   we know that it is not concave, and that it does not rest on any
   foundation. So the Bible speaks of the decrees of God as they appear to
   us in their successive revelation and in their mutual relations, and
   not as they exist from eternity in the divine mind. Neither is there
   any force in the objection that the agent must be before his acts. The
   sun is not before his brightness, nor the mind before thought, nor life
   before consciousness, nor God before his purposes. These objections are
   founded on the assumption that God is subject to the limitations of
   time. To Him there is neither past nor future, neither before nor
   after.

   D. The Decrees of God are Immutable.

   Change of purpose arises either from the want of wisdom or from, the
   want of power. As God is infinite in wisdom and power, there can be
   with Him no unforeseen emergency and no inadequacy of means, and
   nothing can resist the execution of his original intention. To Him,
   therefore, the causes of change have no existence. With God there is,
   as the Scriptures teach, "no variableness, neither shadow of turning."
   (James i. 17.) "The counsel of the Lord standeth for ever, the thoughts
   of his heart to all generations. (Ps. xxxiii. 11.) "The Lord of hosts
   hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass;
   and as I have purposed, so shall it stand." (Is. xiv. 24.) "I am God
   . . . . declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times
   the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I
   will do all my pleasure." (Is. xlvi. 9, 10.) The uniformity of the laws
   of nature is a constant revelation of the immutability of God. They are
   now what they were at the beginning of time, and they are the same in
   every part of the universe. No less stable are the laws which regulate
   the operations of the reason and conscience. The whole government of
   God, as the God of nature and as moral governor, rests on the
   immutability of his counsels.

   E. The Decrees of God are Free.

   This includes three ideas, --

   1. They are rational determinations, founded on sufficient reasons.
   This is opposed to the doctrine of necessity, which assumes that God
   acts by a mere necessity of nature, and that all that occurs is due to
   the law of development or of self-manifestation of the divine being.
   This reduces God to a mere natura naturans, or vis formativa, which
   acts without design. The true doctrine is opposed also to the idea that
   the only cause of events is an intellectual force analogous to the
   instincts of irrational animals. The acts performed under the guidance
   of instinct are not free acts, for liberty is a libentia rationalis,
   spontaneity determined by reason. It is therefore involved in the idea
   of God as a rational and personal being that his decrees are free. He
   was free to create or not to create; to create such a world as now is,
   or one entirely different. He is free to act or not act, and when He
   purposes, it is not from any blind necessity, but according to the
   counsel of his own will.

   2. Our purposes are free, even when formed under the influence of other
   minds. We may be argued or persuaded into certain courses of action, or
   induced to form our designs out of regard to the wishes or interests of
   others. God is infinitely exalted above all ab extra influence. "Who
   hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?"
   (Rom. xi. 34.) "Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like
   Him? Who hath enjoined Him his way?" (Job xxxvi. 22, 23.) "Who hath
   directed the Spirit of the Lord? or being his counsellor hath taught
   Him? With whom took He counsel, and who instructed Him, and taught Him
   in the path of judgment?" (Is. xl. 13, 14.) "Who hath known the mind of
   the Lord, that he may instruct Him?" (1 Cor. ii. 16.) God adopted the
   plan of the universe on the grounds of his own good pleasure, for his
   own glory, and every subordinate part of it in reference to the whole.
   His decrees are free, therefore, in a far higher sense than that in
   which the ordinary purposes of men are free. They were formed purely on
   the counsel of his own will. He purposes and does what seemeth good in
   his sight.

   3. The decrees of God are free in the sense of being absolute or
   sovereign. The meaning of this proposition is expressed negatively by
   saying that the decrees of God are in no case conditional. The event
   decreed is suspended on a condition, but the purpose of God is not. It
   is inconsistent with the nature of God to assume suspense or indecision
   on his part. If He has not absolutely determined on what is to occur,
   but waits until an undetermined condition is or is not fulfilled, then
   his decrees can neither be eternal nor immutable. He purposes one thing
   if the condition be fulfilled, and another if it be not fulfilled, and
   thus everything must be uncertain not only in the divine mind, but also
   in the event. The Scriptures, therefore, teach that He doeth whatsoever
   He pleaseth. (Ps. cxv. 3.) He doeth his pleasure in the army of heaven,
   and among the inhabitants of the earth. (Dan. iv. 35; Ps. cxxxv. 6.) Of
   Him, and through Him, and to Him are all things. (Rom. xi. 36.) It is
   expressly taught that the purposes of God, even as to the future
   destiny of men, are founded on his own good pleasure. As all have
   sinned and come short of the glory of God, He has mercy upon whom He
   will have mercy. It is not according to our works, but of his grace
   that He saves us. It is of Him that we are in Christ Jesus, that those
   who glory should glory in the Lord. (Matt. xi. 26; Rom. viii. 29, 30;
   ix. 15-18; Eph. i. 5, etc., etc.)

   F. The Decrees of God are certainly Efficacious.

   The decrees of God are certainly efficacious, that is, they render
   certain the occurrence of what He decrees. Whatever God foreordains,
   must certainly come to pass. The distinction between the efficient (or
   efficacious) and the permissive decrees of God, although important, has
   no relation to the certainty of events. All events embraced in the
   purpose of God are equally certain, whether He has determined to bring
   them to pass by his own power, or simply to permit their occurrence
   through the agency of his creatures. It was no less certain from
   eternity that Satan would tempt our first parents, and that they would
   fall, than that God would send his Son to die for sinners. The
   distinction in question has reference only to the relation which events
   bear to the efficiency of God. Some things He purposes to do, others He
   decrees to permit to be done. He effects good, He permits evil. He is
   the author of the one, but not of the other. With this explanation, the
   proposition that the decrees of God are certainly efficacious, or
   render certain all events to which they refer, stands good. This is
   proved, --

   1. From the perfection of God, which forbids the ascription to Him of
   purposes uncertain as to their accomplishment. No man fails to execute
   what he purposes, except through the want of wisdom or power to secure
   the end proposed, or through some vacillation in his own mind. It would
   be to reduce God to the level of his creatures, to assume that what He
   decrees, should fail to come to pass.

   2. From the unity of God's plan. If that plan comprehends all events,
   all events stand in mutual relation and dependence. If one part fails,
   the whole may fail or be thrown into confusion.

   3. From the evident concatenation of events in the progress of history,
   which proves that all things are intimately connected, the most
   important events often depending on the most trivial, which shows that
   all must be comprehended in the plan of God.

   4. From the providential and moral government of God. There could be no
   certainty in either if the decrees of God were not efficacious. There
   could be no assurance that any divine prophecy, promise, or
   threatening, would be accomplished. All ground of confidence in God
   would thus be lost, and chance and not God would become the arbiter of
   all events. The Scriptures variously and constantly teach this
   doctrine, (a.) By all those passages which assert the immutability and
   sovereignty of the divine decrees. (b.) By those which affirm that He
   fixes the bounds of our habitations, that our days are all numbered,
   and that even a hair from our heads cannot perish without his notice.
   (c.) By those which declare that nothing can counteract his designs.
   "The Lord of hosts," says the prophet, "hath purposed, who shall
   disannul it? And his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it
   back." (Is. xiv. 27.) "I will work, and who shall let it?" (xliii. 13.)
   (d.) By those which teach doctrines that necessarily assume the
   certainty of all God's decrees. The whole plan of redemption rests on
   that foundation. It is inconceivable that God should devise such a
   scheme, and not secure its executions and that He should send his Son
   into the world, and leave the consequences of that infinite
   condescension undetermined. It is, therefore, the doctrine of reason as
   well as of Scripture, that God has a plan or end for which the universe
   was created, that the execution of that plan is not left contingent,
   and that whatever is embraced in the decrees of God must certainly come
   to pass.

   G. The Decrees of God relate to all Events.

   God foreordains whatsoever comes to pass. Some events are necessary,
   that is, are brought about by the action of necessary causes; others
   are contingent or free, or are acts of free agents; some are morally
   good, others are sinful. The doctrine of the Bible is, that all events,
   whether necessary or contingent, good or sinful, are included in the
   purpose of God, and that their futurition or actual occurrence is
   rendered absolutely certain. This is evident, --

   1. From the unity of the divine purposes. That unity supposes that the
   whole scheme of creation, providence, and redemption, was fixed by the
   divine decree. It was formed from ages in the divine mind, and is
   gradually unfolded by the course of events. It is therefore
   inconsistent with this sublime and Scriptural representation, to
   suppose that any class of actual events, and especially that class
   which is most influential and important, should be omitted from the
   divine purpose. He who purposes a machine, purposes all its parts. The
   general who plans a campaign, includes all the movements of every
   corps, division, and brigade in his army, and if his foresight were
   perfect, and his control of events absolute, his foreordination would
   extend to every act of every soldier. Whatever is wanting in his
   foreordination is due to the limitation of human power. As God is
   infinite in knowledge and resources, his purpose must include all
   events.

   2. It is therefore inconsistent with the perfection of God to suppose
   either that He could not form a plan comprehending all events, or that
   He could not carry it into execution, without doing violence to the
   nature of his creatures.

   3. The universality of the decree follows from the universal dominion
   of God. Whatever He does, He certainly purposed to do. Whatever He
   permits to occur, He certainly purposed to permit. Nothing can occur
   that was not foreseen, and if foreseen it must have been intended. As
   the Scriptures teach that the providential control of God extends to
   all events, even the most minute, they do thereby teach that his
   decrees are equally comprehensive.

   4. Another argument is derived from the certainty of the divine
   government. As all events are more or less intimately connected, and as
   God works by means, if God does not determine the means as well as the
   event, all certainty as to the event itself would be destroyed. In
   determining the redemption of man, He thereby determined on the
   mission, incarnation, sufferings, death, and resurrection of his Son,
   on the gift of the Spirit, upon the faith, repentance, and perseverance
   of all his people. The prediction of future events, which often depend
   on the most fortuitous occurrences, or which include those that appear
   to us of no account, proves that the certainty of the divine
   administration rests on the foreordination of God extending to all
   events both great and small.

   The Scriptures in various ways teach that God foreordains whatever
   comes to pass.

   1. They teach that God works all things according to the counsel of his
   will. There is nothing to limit the words "all things," and therefore
   they must be taken in the fullest extent.

   2. It is expressly declared that fortuitous events, that is, events
   which depend on causes so subtle and so rapid in their operation as to
   elude our observation, are predetermined; as the falling of the lot,
   the flight of an arrow, the falling of a sparrow, the number of the
   hairs of our heads.

   Free Acts are Foreordained.

   3. The Bible especially declares that the free acts of men are decreed
   beforehand. This is involved in the doctrine of prophecy, which assumes
   that events involving the free acts of a multitude of men are foreseen
   and foreordained. God promises to give faith, a new heart, to write his
   law upon the minds of his people, to work in them to will and to do, to
   convert the Gentiles, to fill the world with the true worshippers of
   Christ, to whom every knee is gladly to bow. If God has promised these
   things, He must of course purpose them, but they all involve the free
   acts of men.

   4. The Scriptures teach that sinful acts, as well as such as are holy,
   are foreordained. In Acts ii. 23, it is said, "Him, being delivered by
   the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by
   wicked hands have crucified and slain;" iv. 27. "For of a truth against
   thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius
   Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered
   together, for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined
   before to be done." "Truly the Son of Man goeth as it was determined;
   but woe unto that man by whom He is betrayed." (Luke xxii. 22.) It was
   foreordained that He should be betrayed; but woe to him who fulfilled
   the decree. Here foreordination and responsibility are by our Lord
   Himself declared to coexist and to be consistent. In Rev. xvii. 17, it
   is said, "God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to
   agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God
   shall be fulfilled." The crucifixion of Christ was beyond doubt
   foreordained of God. It was, however, the greatest crime ever
   committed. It is therefore beyond all doubt the doctrine of the Bible
   that sin is foreordained.

   5. Besides this, the conquests of Nebuchadnezzar, the destruction of
   Jerusalem, and many other similar events, were predicted, and therefore
   predetermined, but they included the commission of innumerable sins,
   without which the predictions, and consequently the revealed purposes
   of God, could not have been accomplished.

   6. The whole course of history is represented as the development of the
   plan and purposes of God; and yet human history is little else than the
   history of sin. No one can read the simple narrative concerning Joseph,
   as given in the book of Genesis, without seeing that everything in his
   history occurred in execution of a preconceived purpose of God. The
   envy of his brethren, their selling him into Egypt, and his unjust
   imprisonment, were all embraced in God's plan. "God," as Joseph himself
   said to his brethren, "sent me before you, to preserve you a posterity
   in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. So now it
   was not you that sent me hither, but God." (Gen. xlv. 7, 8.) This is
   but an illustration. What is true of the history of Joseph, is true of
   all history. It is the development of the plan of God: God is in
   history, and although we cannot trace his path step by step, yet it is
   plain in the general survey of events, through long periods, that they
   are ordered by God to the accomplishment of his divine purposes. This
   is obvious enough in the history of the Jewish nation, as recorded in
   the Scripture, but it is no less true in regard to all history. The
   acts of the wicked in persecuting the early Church, were ordained of
   God as the means for the wider and more speedy proclamation of the
   Gospel. The sufferings of the martyrs were the means not only of
   extending but of purifying the Church. The apostasy of the man of sin
   being predicted, was predetermined. The destruction of the Huguenots in
   France, the persecution of the Puritans in England, laid the foundation
   for the planting of North America with a race of godly and energetic
   men, who were to make this land the land of refuge for the nations, the
   home of liberty, civil and religious. It would destroy the confidence
   of God's people could they be persuaded that God does not foreordain
   whatsoever comes to pass. It is because the Lord reigns, and doeth his
   pleasure in heaven and on earth, that they repose in perfect security
   under his guidance and protection.

   § 2. Objections to the Doctrine of Divine Decrees.

   A. Foreordination inconsistent with Free Agency.

   It is urged that the foreordination of all events is inconsistent with
   the free agency of man. The force of this objection depends on what is
   meant by a free act. To decide whether two things are inconsistent, the
   nature of each must be determined. By the decrees of God are to be
   understood the purpose of God rendering certain the occurrence of
   future events. By a free act is meant an act of rational
   self-determination by an intelligent person. If such an act is from its
   very nature contingent, or uncertain, then it is clear that
   foreordination is inconsistent with free agency. This theory of liberty
   has been adopted by a large body of philosophers and theologians, and
   is for them an insuperable objection to the doctrine of the divine
   decrees. In answer to the objection, it may be remarked, (1.) That it
   bears with equal force against foreknowledge. What is foreknown must be
   certain, as much as what is foreordained. If the one, therefore, be
   inconsistent with liberty, so also is the other. This is sometimes
   candidly admitted. Socinus argues that the knowledge of God embraces
   all that is knowable. Future free actions being uncertain, are not the
   objects of knowledge, and therefore it is no impeachment of the divine
   omniscience to say that they cannot be known. But then they cannot he
   predicted. We find, however, that the Scriptures are filled with such
   predictions. It is, therefore, evident that the sacred writers fully
   believed that free acts are foreknown by the divine mind, and therefore
   are certain as to their occurrence. Besides, if God cannot foreknow how
   free agents will act, He must be ignorant of the future, and be
   constantly increasing in knowledge. This is so incompatible with all
   proper ideas of the infinite mind, that it has been almost universally
   rejected, both by philosophers and by Christian theologians. A still
   weaker evasion is that proposed by some Arminian writers, who admit
   that God's knowledge is not limited by anything out of Himself, but
   hold that it may be limited by his own will. In creating free agents,
   He willed not to foreknow how they would act, in order to leave their
   freedom unimpaired. But this is to suppose that God wills not to be
   God; that the Infinite wills to be finite. Knowledge with God is not
   founded on his will, except so far as the knowledge of vision is
   concerned, i.e., his knowledge of his own purposes, or of what He has
   decreed shall come to pass. If not founded on his will, it cannot be
   limited by it. Infinite knowledge must know all things, actual or
   possible. It may, however, be said that there is a difference between
   foreknowledge and foreordination, in so far that the former merely
   assumes the certainty of future events, whereas the latter causes their
   futurition. But as the certainty of occurrence is the same in both
   cases, it makes no difference as to the matter in hand. The decree only
   renders the event certain; and therefore if certainty be not
   inconsistent with liberty, then foreordination is not. That an event
   may be free and yet certain, may be easily proved. (1.) It is a matter
   of consciousness. We are often absolutely certain how we shall act, so
   far as we are free to act at all, and conscious that we act freely. A
   parent may be certain that he will succor a child in distress, and be
   conscious that his free agency is not thereby impaired. The more
   certain, in many cases, the more perfectly are we self-controlled. (2.)
   Free acts have been predicted, and therefore their occurrence was
   certain. (3) Nothing was more certain than that our Lord would continue
   holy, harmless, and undefiled, yet his acts were all free. (4.) It is
   certain that the people of God will repent, believe, and persevere in
   holiness forever in heaven, yet they do not cease to be free agents.
   The decrees of God, therefore, which only secure the certainty of
   events, are not inconsistent with liberty as to the mode of their
   occurrence. Although his purpose comprehends all things, and is
   immutable, yet thereby "no violence is offered to the will of the
   creatures, nor is the liberty or contingency of second causes taken
   away, but rather established."

   B. Foreordination of Sin inconsistent with Holiness.

   It is further objected that it is inconsistent with the holiness of God
   that He should foreordain sin. There are two methods of dealing with
   this and all similar objections. The one may be called the Scriptural
   method, as it is the one often adopted by the sacred writers. It
   consists in showing that the objection bears against the plain
   declarations of Scripture, or against the facts of experience. In
   either case, it is for us sufficiently answered. It is vain to argue
   that a holy and benevolent God cannot permit sin and misery, if sin and
   misery actually exist. It is vain to say that his impartiality forbids
   that there should be any diversity in the endowments, advantages, or
   happiness of his rational creatures. It is vain to insist that a holy
   God cannot permit children to suffer for the sins of their parents,
   when we constantly see that they do thus suffer. So it is utterly
   irrational to contend that God cannot foreordain sin, if He
   foreordained (as no Christian doubts) the crucifixion of Christ. The
   occurrence of sin in the plan adopted by God, is a palpable fact; the
   consistency, therefore, of foreordination with the holiness of God
   cannot rationally be denied. The second method of dealing with such
   objections is to show that the principle on which they are founded is
   unsound. The principle on which the objection under consideration
   rests, is that an agent is responsible for all the necessary or certain
   consequences of his acts. The objection is, that a holy God cannot
   decree the occurrence of sin, because his decree renders that
   occurrence certain. That is, an agent is responsible for whatever his
   act renders certain. That principle, however, is utterly untenable. A
   righteous judge, in pronouncing sentence on a criminal, may be sure
   that he will cause wicked and bitter feelings in the criminal's mind,
   or in the hearts of his friends, and yet the judge be guiltless. A
   father, in excluding a reprobate son from his family, may see that the
   inevitable consequence of such exclusion will be his greater
   wickedness, and yet the father may do right. It is the certain
   consequence of God's leaving the fallen angels and the finally
   impenitent to themselves, that they will continue in sin, and yet the
   holiness of God remain untarnished. The Bible clearly teaches that God
   judicially abandons men to their sins, giving them up to a reprobate
   mind, and He therein is most just and holy. It is not true, therefore,
   that an agent is responsible for all the certain consequences of his
   acts. It may be, and doubtless is, infinitely wise and just in God to
   permit the occurrence of sin, and to adopt a plan of which sin is a
   certain consequence or element; yet as he neither causes sin, nor
   tempts men to its commission, He is neither its author nor approver. He
   sees and knows that higher ends will be accomplished by its admission
   than by its exclusion, that a perfect exhibition of his infinite
   perfections will be thereby effected and therefore for the highest
   reason decrees that it shall occur through the free choice of
   responsible agents. Our great ground of confidence, however, is the
   assurance that the judge of all the earth must do right. Sin is, and
   God is; therefore the occurrence of sin must be consistent with his
   nature; and as its occurrence cannot have been unforeseen or
   undesigned, God's purpose or decree that it should occur must be
   consistent with his holiness.

   C. The Doctrine of Decrees destroys all Motive to Exertion.

   A third objection is, that the doctrine of foreordination, which
   supposes the certainty of all events, tends to the neglect of all use
   of means. If everything will happen just as God has predetermined, we
   need give ourselves no concern, and need make no effort. (1.) This
   objection supposes that God has determined the end without reference to
   the means. The reverse, however, is true. The event is determined in
   connection with the means. If the latter fail, so will the former. God
   has decreed that men shall live by food. If any man refuses to eat, he
   will die. He has ordained that men shall be saved through faith. If a
   man refuses to believe, he will perish. If God has purposed that a man
   shall live, He has also purposed to preserve him from the suicidal
   folly of refusing to eat. (2.) There is another fallacy included in
   this objection. It supposes that the certainty that an event will
   happen, acts as a motive to neglect the means of its attainment. This
   is not according to reason or experience. The stronger the hope of
   success, the greater the motive to exertion. If sure of success in the
   use of the appropriate means, the incentive to effort becomes as strong
   as it can be. On the other hand, the less hope, the less disposition
   there is to exert ourselves; and where there is no hope, there will be
   no exertion. The rational and Scriptural foundation for the use of
   means, and the proper motives to avail ourselves of them, are, (1.) The
   command of God. (2.) Their adaptation to produce the effect. (3.) The
   divine ordination which makes the means necessary to the attainment of
   the end. And (4.) The promise of God to give his blessing to those who
   obediently avail themselves of the means of his appointment.

   D. It is Fatalism.

   It is objected, in the fourth place, that the doctrine of decrees
   amounts to the heathen doctrine of fate. There is only one point of
   agreement between these doctrines. They both assume absolute certainty
   in the sequence of all events. They differ, however, not only as to the
   ground of that certainty, the nature of the influence by which it is
   secured, and the ends therein contemplated, but also in their natural
   effects on the reason and conscience of men.

   The word Fatalism has been applied to different systems, some of which
   admit, while others deny or ignore the existence of a supreme
   intelligence. But in common usage it designates the doctrine that all
   events come to pass under the operation of a blind necessity. This
   system differs from the Scriptural doctrine of foreordination, (1.) In
   that it excludes the idea of final causes. There is no end to which all
   things tend, and for the accomplishment of which they exist. According
   to the Scriptural doctrine, all things are ordained and controlled to
   accomplish the highest conceivable or possible good. (2.) In that
   according to Fatalism the sequence of events is determined by an
   unintelligent concatenation of causes and effects. According to the
   doctrine of decrees, that sequence is determined by infinite wisdom and
   goodness. (3.) Fatalism admits of no distinction between necessary and
   free causes. The acts of rational agents are as much determined by a
   necessity out of themselves as the operations of nature. According to
   the Scriptures, the freedom and responsibility of man are fully
   preserved. The two systems differ, therefore, as much as a machine
   differs from a man; or as the actions of infinite intelligence, power,
   and love differ from the law of gravitation. (4.) The one system,
   therefore, leads to the denial of all moral distinctions, and to stolid
   insensibility or despair. The other to a sedulous regard to the will of
   an infinitely wise and good ruler, all whose acts are determined by a
   sufficient reason; and to filial confidence and submission.

CHAPTER X.

  CREATION.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Different Theories concerning the Origin of the Universe.

   The question concerning the origin of the universe has forced itself on
   the minds of men in all ages. That the mutable cannot be eternal, would
   seem to be self-evident. As everything within the sphere of human
   observation is constantly changing, men have been constrained to
   believe that the world as it now is had a beginning. But if it began to
   be, whence did it come? Without the light of a divine revelation, this
   question is unanswerable. The data for the solution of the problem do
   not lie within the sphere either of experience or of reason. All human
   theories on this subject are nothing more than conjectures more or less
   ingenious.

   Apart from the pantheistic doctrine which makes the universe the
   existence form, or, as Goethe calls it, "das lebendige Kleid" (the
   living garment) of God, the most prevalent views on this subject are,
   First, those theories which exclude mind from the causative origin of
   the world; Secondly, those which admit of mind, but only as connected
   with matter; and Thirdly, the Scriptural doctrine which assumes the
   existence of an infinite extramundane mind to whose power and will the
   existence of all things out of God is to be referred.

   It is a self-evident truth that existence cannot spring spontaneously
   from non-existence. In this sense ex nihilo nihil fit is an universally
   admitted axiom. Those, therefore, who deny the existence of an
   extramundane mind, are forced to admit that as the universe now is, it
   must have always been. But as it is in a state of perpetual change it
   has not always been as it now is. There was a primordial state out of
   which the present order of things has arisen. The question is, How?

   The purely Physical Theory.

   According to the first hypothesis just mentioned, the primordial
   condition of the universe was that of universally diffused matter in a
   highly attenuated state. This matter had the properties, or forces,
   which it now everywhere exhibits; and under the operation of these
   forces and in accordance with the laws of heat, motion, etc., not only
   the great cosmical bodies were formed and arranged themselves in their
   present harmonious relations, but also all the organisms, vegetable and
   animal, on this globe and elsewhere, were fashioned and sustained.
   Every man knows enough of physical laws to be able to predict with
   certainty that on a cold day in the open air the moisture of his breath
   will be condensed; so, according to Professor Huxley, on this
   hypothesis, with adequate knowledge of those laws, it would have been
   easy from the beginning to predict, not only the mechanism of the
   heavens, but the fauna and flora of our globe in all the states and
   stages of its existence.

   The Nebular hypothesis, as first proposed by La Place, was the
   application of this theory to the explanation of the origin and order
   of the heavenly bodies. This hypothesis may be thus stated, "Suppose
   that the matter composing the entire solar system once existed in the
   condition of a single nebulous mass, extending beyond the orbit of the
   most remote planet. Suppose that this nebula has a slow rotation upon
   an axis, and that by radiation it gradually cools, thereby contracting
   in its dimensions. As it contracts in its dimensions, its velocity of
   rotation, according to the principles of Mechanics, must necessarily
   increase, and the centrifugal force thus generated in the exterior
   portion of the nebula would at length become equal to the attraction of
   the central mass. This exterior portion would thus become detached, and
   revolve independently as an immense zone or ring. As the central mass
   continued to cool and contract in its dimensions, other zones would in
   the same manner become detached, while the central mass continually
   decreases in size and increases in density. The zones thus successively
   detached would generally break up into separate masses revolving
   independently about the sun; and if their velocities were slightly
   unequal, the matter of each zone would ultimately collect in a single
   planetary, but still gaseous, mass, having a spheroidal form, and also
   a motion of rotation about an axis. As each of these planetary masses
   became still farther cooled, it would pass through a succession of
   changes similar to those of the first solar nebula; rings of matter
   would be formed surrounding the planetary nucleus, and these rings, if
   they broke up into separate masses, would ultimately form satellites
   revolving about their primaries." [509] We thus have an ordered
   universe without the intervention of mind. Every one knows, however,
   that there is a form in which the nebular hypothesis is held by many
   Christian theists.

   Theories which assume Intelligence in Nature itself.

   The obvious impossibility of blind causes acting intelligently, or, of
   necessary causes being elective in their operation, has led many who
   deny the existence of an extramundane Mind to hold, that life and
   intelligence pertain to matter itself in some at least of its
   combinations. A plant lives. There is something in the seed which
   secures its development, each after its kind. There is, therefore,
   something in the plant, which according to this theory is not external
   to the plant itself, which does the work of mind. That is, it selects
   or chooses from the earth and air the elements needed for its support
   and growth. It moulds these elements into organic forms, intended to
   answer a purpose, and adapted with wonderful skill to accomplish a
   given object. With regard to this principle of life, this vital force,
   it is to be remarked that it is in the plant; that it is never
   manifested, never acts, except in union with the matter of which the
   plant is composed; when the plant dies, its vitality is extinguished.
   It ceases to exist in the same sense in which light ceases when
   darkness takes its place.

   What is true of the vegetable, is no less true of the animal world.
   Every animal starts in an almost imperceptible germ. But that germ has
   something in it which determines with certainty the genus, species, and
   variety of the animal. It fashions all his organs; prepares the eye for
   the light yet to be seen; the ear for sounds yet to be heard; the lungs
   for air yet to be breathed. Nothing more wonderful than this is
   furnished by the universe in any of its phenomena.

   If, therefore, vegetable and animal life work all these wonders, what
   need have we to assume an extramundane mind to account for any of the
   phenomena of the universe? All that is necessary is, that nature,
   natura naturans, the vis in rebus insita, should act just as we see
   that the vital principle does act in plants and animals. This is
   Hylozoism; the doctrine that matter is imbued with a principle of life.

   Another form of this theory is more dualistic. It admits the existence
   of mind and matter as distinct substances, but always existing in
   combination, as soul and body in man in our present stage of being. The
   advocates of this doctrine, therefore, instead of speaking of nature as
   the organizing force, speak of the soul of the world; the anima mundi,
   etc.

   It is enough to remark concerning these theories, (1.) That they leave
   the origin of things unaccounted for. Whence came the matter, which the
   theory in one form assumes? Whence came its physical properties, to
   which all organization is referred? And as to the other doctrine, it
   may be asked, Whence came the living germs of plants and animals? To
   assume that matter in a state of chaos is eternal; or that there has
   been an endless succession of living germs; or that there has been an
   eternal succession of cycles in the history of the universe, chaos
   unfolding itself into cosmos, during immeasurable ages, are all
   assumptions which shock the reason, and must of necessity be destitute
   of proof.

   (2.) These theories are atheistic. They deny the existence of a
   personal Being to whom we stand in the relation of creatures and
   children. The existence of such a Being is an innate, intuitive truth.
   It cannot be permanently disbelieved. And, therefore, any theory which
   denies the existence of God must be not only false but short-lived.

   The Scriptural Doctrine.

   The Scriptural doctrine on this subject is expressed in the first words
   of the Bible: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."
   The heavens and the earth include all things out of God. Of which
   things the Scriptures teach that they owe their existence to the will
   and power of God. The Scriptural doctrine therefore is, (1.) That the
   universe is not eternal. It began to be. (2.) It was not formed out of
   any preëxistence or substance; but was created ex nihilo. (3.) That
   creation was not necessary. It was free to God to create or not to
   create, to create the universe as it is, or any other order and system
   of things, according to the good pleasure of his will.

   The doctrine of an eternal creation has been held in various forms.
   Origen, although he referred the existence of the universe to the will
   of God, still held that it was eternal. We speak of the divine decrees
   as free and yet as from everlasting. So Origen held that this was not
   the first world God made; that there never was a first, and never will
   be a last. "Quid ante faciebat Deus," he asks, "quam mundus inciperet?
   Otiosam enim et immobilem dicere naturam Dei, impium est simul et
   absurdum, vel putare, quod bonitas aliquando bene non fecerit, et
   omnipotentia aliquando non egerit potentatum. Hoc nobis objicere solent
   dicentibus mundum hunc ex certo tempore coepisse, et secundum scripturæ
   fidem annos quoque ætatis ipsius numerantibus. . . . . Nos vero
   consequenter respondimus observantes regulam pietatis, quoniam non tunc
   primum cum visibilem istum mundum fecit Deus, coepit operari, sed sicut
   post corruptionem hujus erit alius mundus, ita et antequam hic esset,
   fuisse alios credimus." [510]

   Of course those of the schoolmen who made the thoughts of God creative,
   or identified purpose with act, or who said with Scotus Erigena, "Non
   aliud Deo esse et velle et facere," must regard the universe as
   coeternal with God. This was done by Scotus in a pantheistic sense, but
   others who regarded the universe as distinct from God and dependent
   upon Him, still held that the world is eternal. The influence of the
   modern Monistic philosophy, even upon theologians who believe in an
   extramundane personal God, has been such as to lead many of them to
   assume that the relation between God and the world is such that it must
   have always existed. The common doctrine of the Church has ever been,
   in accordance with the simple teaching of the Bible, that the world
   began to be.

   The second point included in the Scriptural doctrine of creation is,
   that the universe was not formed out of any preëxistent matter, nor out
   of the substance of God. The assumption that any thing existed out of
   God and independent of his will, has ever been rejected as inconsistent
   with the perfection and absolute supremacy of God. The other idea,
   however, namely, that God fashioned the world out of his own substance,
   has found advocates, more or less numerous, in every age of the Church.
   Augustine, referring to this opinion, says, "Fecisti coelum et terram;
   non de te: nam esset æquale unigenito tuo, ac per hoc et tibi, . . . .
   et aliud præter te non erat, unde faceres ea; . . . . et ideo de nihilo
   fecisti coelum et terram." [511]

   Not only those of the schoolmen and of the modern theologians who are
   inclined to the Monistic theory, made all things to be modifications of
   the substance of God, but many Theistic and even Evangelical writers of
   our day hold the same doctrine. [512] Sir William Hamilton also held
   that it is impossible to conceive the complement of existence being
   either increased or diminished. When anything new appears we are forced
   to regard it as something which had previously existed in another form.
   "We are unable, on the one hand, to conceive nothing becoming
   something; or, on the other, something becoming nothing. When God is
   said to create out of nothing, we construe this to thought by supposing
   that He evolves existence out of Himself; we view the Creator as the
   cause of the Universe. Ex nihilo nihil, in nihilum nil posse reverti,'
   expresses, in its purest form, the whole intellectual phenomenon of
   causality." [513] To this he elsewhere adds, "In like manner, we
   conceive annihilation, only by conceiving the Creator to withdraw his
   creation from actuality into power. . . . The mind is thus compelled to
   recognize an absolute identity of existence in the effect and in the
   complement of its causes -- between the causatum and the causa," [514]
   and therefore, "an absolute identity of existence" between God and the
   world. This doctrine the fathers, and the Church generally, strenuously
   resisted as inconsistent with the nature of God. It supposes that the
   substance of God admits of partition or division; that the attributes
   of God can be separated from his substance; and that the divine
   substance can become degraded and polluted.

   The third point included in the Scriptural doctrine of creation is,
   that it was an act of God's free will. He was free to create or not to
   create. This is opposed to the doctrine of necessary creation, which
   has been set forth in different forms. Some regard the phenomenal
   universe as a mere evolution of absolute being by a necessary process,
   as a plant is developed from a seed. Others, regarding God as a Spirit,
   make life and thought essential and coeternal with Him, and this life
   and power are of necessity creative. God's "essence," says Cousin,
   "consists precisely in his creative power." [515] Again, he says, [516]
   "He cannot but produce; so that the creation ceases to be
   unintelligible; and God is no more without a world than a world without
   God." As, however, thought is spontaneous, Cousin, when called to
   account for such utterances, maintained that he did not deny that
   creation was free.

   Some who do not admit that God is under any natural or metaphysical
   necessity to give existence to the universe, still assert a moral
   necessity for the creation of sensitive and rational creatures. God, it
   is said, is love; but it is the nature of love to long to communicate
   itself, and to hold fellowship with others than itself. Therefore God's
   nature impels Him to call into existence creatures in whom and over
   whom He can rejoice. Others say, that God is benevolence, and therefore
   is under a moral necessity of creating beings whom He can render happy.
   Thus Leibnitz says "Dieu n'est point nécessité, métaphysiquement
   parlant, à la création de ce monde. . . . . Cependant Dieu est obligé,
   par une nécessité morale, à faire les choses en sorte qu'il ne se
   puisse rien de mieux." [517]

   According to the Scriptures God is self-sufficient. He needs nothing
   out of Himself for his own well-being or happiness. He is in every
   respect independent of his creatures; and the creation of the universe
   was the act of the free will of that God of whom the Apostle says in
   Rom. xi. 36, "Of Him, and through Him, and to Him are all things."

   The common faith of the Church on this subject is clearly and
   beautifully expressed by Melancthon: [518] "Quod autem res ex nihilo
   conditæ sint, docet hæc sententia: ipse dixit et facta sunt; ipse
   mandavit, et creata sunt, id est dicente seu jubente Deo, res exortæ
   sunt: non igitur ex materia priore exstructæ sunt, sed Deo dicente, cum
   res non essent, esse coeperunt; et cum Joannes in quit: Omnia per ipsum
   facta esse, refutat Stoicam imaginationem, quæ fingit materiam non esse
   factam."

   § 2. Mediate and Immediate Creation.

   But while it has ever been the doctrine of the Church that God created
   the universe out of nothing by the word of his power, which creation
   was instantaneous and immediate, i.e., without the intervention of any
   second causes; yet it has generally been admitted that this is to be
   understood only of the original call of matter into existence.
   Theologians have, therefore, distinguished between a first and second,
   or immediate and mediate creation. The one was instantaneous, the other
   gradual; the one precludes the idea of any preëxisting substance, and
   of cooperation, the other admits and implies both. There is evident
   ground for this distinction in the Mosaic account of the creation. God,
   we are told, "created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was
   without form and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And
   the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters." Here it is
   clearly intimated that the universe, when first created, was in a state
   of chaos, and that by the life-giving, organizing power of the Spirit
   of God, it was gradually moulded into the wonderful cosmos which we now
   behold. The whole of the first chapter of Genesis, after the first
   verse, is an account of the progress of creation; the production of
   light; the formation of an atmosphere; the separation of land and
   water; the vegetable productions of the earth; the animals of the sea
   and air; then the living creatures of the earth; and, last of all, man.
   In Gen. i. 27, it is said that God created man male and female; in
   chapter ii. 7, it is said, that "the Lord God formed man of the dust of
   the ground." It thus appears that forming out of preëxisting material
   comes within the Scriptural idea of creating. We all recognize God as
   the author of our being, as our Creator, as well as our Preserver. He
   is our Creator, not merely because He is the maker of heaven and earth,
   and because all they contain owe their origin to his will and power,
   but also because, as the Psalmist teaches us, He fashions our bodies in
   secret. "Thine eyes," says the sacred writer, "did see my substance,
   yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which
   in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them."
   (Ps. cxxxix. 16.) And the Bible constantly speaks of God as causing the
   grass to grow, and as being the real author or maker of all that the
   earth, air, or water produces. There is, therefore, according to the
   Scriptures, not only an immediate, instantaneous creation ex nihilo by
   the simple word of God, but a mediate, progressive creation; the power
   of God working in union with second causes.

   Augustine clearly recognizes this idea. "Sicut in ipso grano
   invisibiliter erant omnia simul quæ per tempora in arborem surgerent;
   ita ipse mundus cogitandus est, cum Deus simul omnia creavit, habuisse
   simul omnia quæ in illo et cum illo facta sunt quando factus est dies:
   non solum coelum cum sole et luna et sideribus, quorum species manet
   motu rotabili, et terram et abyssos, quæ velut inconstantes motus
   patiuntur, atque inferius adjuncta partem alteram mundo conferunt; sed
   etiam illa quæ aqua et terra produxit potentialiter atque causaliter,
   priusquam per temporum moras ita exorirentur, quomodo nobis jam nota
   sunt in eis operibus, quæ Deus usque nunc operatur." [519]

   Thus far there is little room for diversity of opinion. But when the
   question is asked, How long was the universe in passing from its
   chaotic to its ordered state? such diversity is at once manifested.
   According to the more obvious interpretation of the first chapter of
   Genesis, this work was accomplished in six days. This therefore has
   been the common belief of Christians. It is a belief founded on a given
   interpretation of the Mosaic record, which interpretation, however,
   must be controlled not only by the laws of language, but by facts. This
   is at present an open question. The facts necessary for its decision
   have not yet been duly authenticated. The believer may calmly await the
   result.

   The theistical advocates of the Nebular Hypothesis assume that the
   universe was an indefinitely long period in coming to its present
   state. God, intending to produce just such a universe as we see around
   us, instead of by a flat calling the sun, moon, and stars, with all
   their marshalled hosts, into existence, created simply nebulous matter
   diffused through space; invested it with certain properties or forces;
   gave it a rotatory motion, and then allowed these physical laws under
   his guidance to work out the harmonious system of the heavens. As He is
   as truly the maker of the oak evolved from the acorn, according to the
   laws of vegetable life, as though He had called it into existence in
   its maturity by a word; so, it is maintained, He is as truly the
   creator of heaven and earth, on the nebular hypothesis, as on the
   assumption of instantaneous creation. This, however, is merely a
   hypothesis which has never commanded general assent among scientific
   men. It is, therefore, of no authority as a norm for the interpretation
   of Scripture.

   The same theory of gradual, or mediate creation, has been applied to
   account for all the phenomena of the vegetable and animal kingdoms.
   This has been done in different forms. According to all these theories
   there must be something to begin with. There must be matter and its
   forces. There must even be life, and living organisms. To account for
   these we are forced to accept of the Scriptural doctrine of an
   immediate creation ex nihilo by the power of God.

   § 3. Proof of the Doctrine.

   The proof of the doctrine of a creation ex nihilo does not rest on the
   usage of the words vr' or ktizein, which are interchanged with sh and
   poiein. God is said to have created the world, and also to be the maker
   of the heavens and the earth. Plants and animals are said to be
   created, although formed out of the dust of the earth. That, however,
   the Scriptures do teach this great doctrine of natural and revealed
   religion, is plain, --

   1. From the fact that no mention is ever made of any preëxisting
   substance out of which the world was made. The original creation is
   never represented as a moulding of matter into form and imbuing it with
   life. Nor do the Scriptures ever represent the world as an emanation
   from God, proceeding from Him by a necessity of his nature. Much less
   does the Bible ever identify God and the world. In thus ignoring all
   other doctrines, the Scriptures leave us under the necessity of
   believing that God created the world out of nothing.

   2. The descriptions of the work of creation given in the Bible,
   preclude the idea of emanation or mere formation. God said, "Let there
   be light, and there was light." In Ps. xxxiii. 6, it it said, "By the
   word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the
   breath of his mouth." And in verse 9: "He spake and it was done; he
   commanded and it stood fast." It was, therefore, in the words of
   Melancthon, already quoted, Dicente seu jubente Deo, that the universe
   was called into existence. "Nam quid est aliud tota creatura," Luther
   asks, "quam verbum Dei a Deo prolatum, seu productum foras? . . . .
   Mundum et omnia creavit facillimo opere, dicendo scilicet, ut non plus
   negotii Deo sit in creatione, quam nobis in appellatione." [520]

   3. The same doctrine is involved in the absolute dependence of all
   things on God, and in his absolute sovereignty over them. "Thou, even
   thou, art Jehovah alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens,
   with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the
   seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all." (Neh. ix.
   6.) "By Him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are
   in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions,
   or principalities, or powers: all things were created by Him, and for
   Him: and He is before all things, and by Him all things consist." (Col.
   i. 16, 17.) "Thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they
   are and were created." (Rev. iv. 11.) The all things spoken of in these
   passages is made to include everything out of God. There can,
   therefore, be no preëxisting matter, existing independently of his
   will. Everything out of God is said to owe its existence to his will.

   4. The same doctrine is included in the Scripture doctrine that the
   universe (ta panta) is ek theou of God; that He is its source, not in
   the Gnostic sense, but in the sense consistent with other
   representations of the Bible, which refer the existence of all things
   to the command of God. The universe, therefore, is "of Him" as its
   efficient cause.

   5. The Apostle in Heb. xi. 3, begins his illustration of the nature and
   power of faith by referring to the creation as the great fundamental
   truth of all religion. If there be no creation, there is no God. If the
   universe was called into being out of nothing, then there must be an
   extramundane Being to whom it owes its existence. The creation is a
   fact which we know only by revelation. What the sacred writer here
   asserts is, First, that the worlds (aiones, all contained in time and
   space) were created, set in order, and established, by the simple word
   or command of God. Compare Ps. lxxiv. (lxxiii.) 16, in the Septuagint,
   su katertiso helion kai selenen. Secondly, this being the case, it
   follows that the universe was not formed out of any preëxisting
   substance. Thirdly, God is not a mere former, but the creator of the
   ordered universe. The difference among commentators in the
   interpretation of this passage does not affect its general sense. The
   words are eis to me ek phainomenon ta blepomena gegonenai. The first
   question is whether eis to expresses the design, or simply the
   consequence. In the former case, the meaning is that God created the
   worlds by a word in order that; i.e., in order that men might know that
   the things seen were not made of what already existed. In the latter,
   it is simply stated as a fact, that as creation was by a word, it was
   not out of any preëxisting substance. The other doubtful point in the
   passage is the construction of the negative particle me. It may be
   connected with phainomenon. This passage is then parallel with 2 Macc.
   vii. 28, ex ouk onton epoiesen auta ho theos; in the Latin, "Peto,
   nate, ut aspicias ad coelum, et terram, et ad omnia, quæ in eis sunt;
   et intelligas, quia ex nihilo fecit illa Deus, et hominum genus."
   Delitzsch, in his commentary on this Epistle, shows that neither the
   position of the negative before the preposition, nor the use of me,
   instead of ou is any valid objection to this interpretation. Others,
   however, prefer to connect the me, with gegonenai, i.e., "the worlds
   were not made out of the phenomenal." The sense in either case is
   substantially the same. But the question arises, What is the implied
   antithesis to the phenomenal? Some say the real, the ideal, the
   thoughts of God. Delitzsch says we must supply to me ek phainomenon,
   all' ek noeton, "and these noeta are the eternal invisible types, out
   of which, as their ideal ground and source, visible things by the fiat
   of God have proceeded." This is Platonism, and foreign to the
   Scriptural mode of thinking and teaching. Whatever is real is
   phenomenal; that is, every substance, everything which really exists
   manifests itself somewhere and somehow. The proper antithesis,
   therefore, to phainomenon is ouk onton. "The worlds were not made out
   of anything which reveals itself as existing even it the sight of God,
   but out of nothing."

   In Rom. iv. 17, God is described as He "who quickeneth the dead, and
   calleth those things which be not, as though they were. To call may
   here be taken in the sense of commanding, controlling by a word. The
   passage then expresses the highest idea of omnipotence. The actual and
   the possible are equally subject to his will; the non-existing, the
   merely possible, is as much obedient to Him as the actually existing.
   Or to call may as elsewhere mean, as De Wette explains it, to call into
   existence. "Der das Nichtseiende als Seiendes hervorruft." Who calls
   the non-existing into existence;" the hos onta being for hos esomena or
   for eis to einai hos onta. On this text Bengel says, "Cogita frequens
   illud yhy Gen. i. exprimitur transitus a non esse ad esse, qui sit
   vocante Deo. Conf. Ez. xxxvi. 29." [521]

   6. The Scriptural doctrine on this subject is confirmed by all those
   passages which ascribe a beginning to the world. By the world is not
   meant the kosmos as distinguished from chaos, the form as distinguished
   from the substance, but both together. According to the Bible there is
   nothing eternal but God. He, and He alone is The Eternal. This is his
   distinguishing title, -- He who is and was and ever shall be. As the
   world therefore began to be, and as the world includes everything out
   of God, there was nothing of which the world could be made. It was
   therefore created ex nihilo. This is taught in the first chapter of
   Genesis, "In the beginning (before anything was) God created the heaven
   and the earth." In many other parts of Scripture a beginning is
   ascribed to the world, as in Ps. xc. 2, "Before the mountains were
   brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even
   from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God." Ps. cii. 25, "Of old
   hast thou laid the foundation of the earth." In John xvii. 5, our Lord
   speaks of the glory which lie had with the Father before the world was.
   The foundation of the world is an epoch. Then time began. What was
   before the foundation of the world is eternal. The world, therefore, is
   not eternal, and if not eternal it must have had a beginning, and if
   all things had a beginning, then there must have been a creation ex
   nihilo.

   7. The doctrine of creation flows from the infinite perfection of God.
   There can be but one infinite being. If anything exists independent of
   his will, God is thereby limited. The idea of the absolute dependence
   of all things on God pervades the Scripture and is involved in our
   religious consciousness. The God of the Bible is all extramundane God,
   existing out of, and before the world, absolutely independent of it,
   its creator, preserver, and governor. So that the doctrine of creation
   is a necessary consequence of Theism. If we deny that the world owes
   its existence to the will of God, then Atheism, Hylozoism, or Pantheism
   would seem to be the logical consequence. Hence, on the one hand, the
   Scriptures make that doctrine so prominent, presenting it on the first
   page of the Bible as the foundation of all subsequent revelations
   concerning the nature of God and his relation to the world, and
   appointing from the beginning one day in seven to be a perpetual
   commemoration of the fact that God created the heaven and earth. And,
   on the other, the advocates of Atheism or Pantheism contend against the
   doctrine of creation as the primary error of all false philosophy and
   religion. "Die Annahme einer Schöpfung ist der Grund-Irrthum aller
   falschen Metaphysik und Religionslehre, und insbesondere das Ur-Princip
   des Juden- und Heidenthums." [522]

   § 4. Objections to the Doctrine.

   1. It has in all ages been urged as an objection to the doctrine of
   creation that it is inconsistent with an axiom, ex nihilo nihil fit.
   That aphorism may, however, have two meanings. It may mean that no
   effect can be without a cause, -- that nothing can produce nothing. In
   that sense it expresses a self-evident truth with which the doctrine of
   creation is perfectly consistent. That doctrine does not suppose that
   the world exists without a cause, or comes from nothing. It assigns a
   perfectly adequate cause for its existence in the will of an Almighty
   intelligent Being. In the other sense of the phrase it means that a
   creation ex nihilo is impossible, that God cannot cause matter, or
   anything else, to begin to be. In this sense it is not a self-evident
   truth, but an arbitrary assumption, and consequently without force or
   authority. It is indeed inconceivable; but so also are the ordinary
   operations of the human will inconceivable. No man can understand how
   mind acts on matter. As the world actually exists, we must admit either
   that it began to be, or that it is eternal. But the difficulties
   connected with this last assumption are, as we saw when arguing for the
   existence of God, far greater than those which attend the admission of
   a creation ex nihilo. It was partly the difficulty of conceiving of the
   non-existing passing into existence, and partly the need for a solution
   of the question concerning the origin of evil, that led Plato and other
   Greek philosophers to adopt the theory of the eternity of matter, which
   they regarded as the source of evil; a theory which passed over to
   Philo and to the Platonizing fathers. The Scriptural theory, or rather
   doctrine of the origin of evil, refers it to the free agency of
   rational creatures, and dispenses with the preëxistence of anything
   independent of God.

   2. A more formidable objection, at least one which has had far more
   power, is that the doctrine of a creation in time is inconsistent with
   the true idea of God. This objection is presented in two forms. First,
   it is said, that the doctrine of creation supposes a distinction
   between will and power, or efficiency and purpose in the divine mind.
   Scotus Erigena [523] says, "Non aliud est Deo esse et facere, sed ei
   esse id ipsum est et facere. Coæternum igitur est Deo suum facere et
   coessentiale." This was the common doctrine of the scholastic theology
   which defined God to be actus purus, and denied any distinction in Him
   between essence and attributes, power and act. If this view of the
   nature of God be correct, then the doctrine that supposes that God's
   eternal purpose did not take effect from eternity, must be false. If
   God creates by thinking, He formed the world when He purposed it.
   Secondly, it is said that the doctrine of creation is inconsistent with
   the nature of God, inasmuch as it assumes a change in Him from inaction
   to activity. What was God doing, it is asked, from eternity before He
   created the world? If He is Creator and Lord, He must always have been
   such, and hence there must always have been a universe over which He
   ruled. These difficulties have led to different theories designed to
   avoid them. Origen, as before mentioned, taught that there has been an
   eternal succession of worlds. Others say that creation is eternal,
   although due to the will of God. He did from the beginning what the
   Scriptures say He did in the beginning. A foot from eternity standing
   in the dust, or a seal from eternity impressed upon wax, would be the
   cause of the impression, although, the impression would be coeternal
   with the foot or seal. Pantheists make the world essential to God. He
   exists only in the world. "Das gottgleiche All ist nicht allein das
   ausgesprochene Wort Gottes (natura naturata) sondern selbst das
   sprechende (natura naturans): nicht das erschaffene, sondern das selbst
   schaffende und sich selbst offenbarende auf unendliche Weise." [524]
   That is, "The universe is not merely the outspoken word of God, but
   also that which speaks; not the created, but the self-creating and
   self-revealing in unending forms."

   Answer to the above Objections.

   With regard to the objections above mentioned, it may be remarked, --

   1. That they are drawn from a region which is entirely beyond our
   comprehension. They assume that we can understand the Almighty unto
   perfection and search out all his ways; whereas it is obvious that with
   regard to a Being who is eternal and not subject to the limitations of
   time, we are using words without meaning when we speak of successive
   duration in reference to Him. If with God there is no past or future,
   it is vain to ask what He was doing before creation. It was stated,
   when treating of the attributes of God, that there are two methods of
   determining our conceptions of the divine nature and operations. The
   one is to start with the idea of the Absolute and Infinite and make
   that idea the touchstone; affirming or denying what is assumed to be
   consistent or inconsistent therewith. Those who adopt this method,
   refuse to submit to the teachings of their moral nature or the
   revelations of the Word of God, and make Him either an absolutely
   unknown cause, or deny to Him all the attributes of a person. The other
   method is to start with the revelation which God has made of Himself in
   the constitution of our own nature and in his holy Word. This method
   leads to the conclusion that God can think and act, that in Him essence
   and attributes are not identical, that power and wisdom, will and
   working in Him, are not one and the same, and that the distinction
   between potentia (inherent power) and act applies to Him as well as to
   us. In other words, that God is infinitely more than pure activity, and
   consequently that it is not inconsistent with his nature that He should
   do at one time what He does not do at another.

   2. A second remark to be made on these objections is that they prove
   too much. If valid against a creation in time, they are valid against
   all exercise of God's power in time. Then there is no such thing as
   providential government, or gracious operations of the Spirit, or
   answering prayer. If whatever God does He does from eternity, then, so
   far as we are concerned, He does nothing. If we exalt the speculative
   ideas of the understanding above our moral and religious nature, and
   above the authority of the Scriptures, we give up all ground both of
   faith and knowledge, and have nothing before us but absolute skepticism
   or atheism. These objections, therefore, are simply of our own making.
   We form an idea of the Absolute Being out of our own heads, and then
   reject whatever does not agree with it. They have, consequently, no
   force except for the man who makes them.

   3. The scholastic theologians, who themselves were in the trammels of
   such philosophical speculations, were accustomed to answer these cavils
   by counter subtleties. Even Augustine says that God did not create the
   world in time, because before creation time was not. "Si literæ sacræ
   maximeque veraces ita dicunt, in principio fecisse Deum coelum et
   terram, ut nihil antea fecisse intelligatur, quia hoc potius in
   principio fecisse diceretur, si quid fecisset ante coetera cuncta quæ
   fecit; procul dubio non est mundus factus in tempore, sed cum tempore."
   [525] This is true enough. If time be duration measured by motion or
   succession, it is plain that before succession there can be no time. It
   is hard, however, to see how this relieves the matter. The fact remains
   that the world is not eternal, and therefore, in our mode of
   conception, there were infinite ages during which the world was not.
   Still the difficulty is purely subjective, arising from the limitations
   of our nature, which forbid our comprehending God, or our understanding
   the relation of his activity to the effects produced in time. All we
   know is that God does work and act, and that the effects of his
   activity take place successively in time.

   4. As to the objection that the doctrine of creation supposes a change
   in God, the theologians answer that it does not suppose any change in
   his will or purpose, for he purposed from eternity to create. On this
   point Augustine [526] says, "Una eademque sempiterna et immutabili
   voluntate res quas condidit et ut prius non essent egit, quamdiu non
   fuerunt, et ut posterius essent, quando esse coeperunt." In other
   words, God did not purpose to create from eternity; but from eternity
   he had the purpose to create. As there is no change of purpose involved
   in creation, so there is no change from inaction to activity involved
   in the doctrine. God is essentially active. But it does not follow that
   his activity is always the same, i.e., that it must always produce the
   same effects. The eternal purpose takes effect just as was intended
   from the beginning. These objections, however, are mere cobwebs; but
   they are cobwebs in the eye; the eye of our feeble understanding. They
   are best got rid of by closing that eye, and opening what the
   Scriptures call "the eyes of the heart." That is, instead of submitting
   ourselves to the guidance of the speculative understanding, we should
   consent to be led by the Spirit as He reveals the things of God in his
   Word, and in our own moral and religious nature.

   § 5. Design of the Creation.

   Men have long endeavoured to find a satisfactory answer to the
   question, Why God created the world? What end was it designed to
   accomplish? Answers to this question have been sought from the
   following sources, -- (1.) The nature of God himself. (2.) From the
   nature of his works and the course of history. (3.) From the
   declarations of the Scriptures. As to the first source, it is to be
   remarked that the systems which preclude the admission of final causes,
   as Materialism and Pantheism in all their forms, of course preclude any
   question as to the design of the creation. The world is the evolution
   of an unconscious, unintelligent force, which has no design out of
   itself. To ask what is the design of the world is, in these systems,
   equivalent to asking what is the design of the being of God; for God is
   the world and the world is God. Those who admit the existence of an
   intelligent extramundane God, and who endeavour from his nature to
   determine the end for which He created the world, have pursued
   different courses and come to different conclusions. From the absolute
   self-sufficiency of God it follows that the creation was not designed
   to meet or satisfy any necessity on his part. He is neither more
   perfect nor more happy because of the creation. Again it follows from
   the nature of an infinite Being that the ground (i.e., both the motive
   and the end) of the creation must be in Himself. As all things are from
   Him and through Him, so also they are for Him. Some infer from his
   holiness that the purpose to create arose, so to speak, from the desire
   to have a field for the development of moral excellence in rational
   creatures. By far the most common opinion from the beginning has been
   that the creation is to be referred to the bonitas, goodness,
   benevolence, or, as the modern Germans at least generally express it,
   the love of God. As God is love, and the nature of love is to
   communicate itself, as it must have an object to be enjoyed and
   rendered blessed, so God created the world that He might rejoice in it
   and render it blessed. From the time of Leibnitz, who made this idea
   the foundation of his "Théodicée," this theory has assumed a more
   contracted form. He reduced love to mere benevolence, or the desire to
   promote happiness. Hence the end of the creation was assumed to be the
   production of happiness. And as God is infinite, not only in
   benevolence, but also in wisdom and power, this world is necessarily
   the best possible world for the production of happiness. This theory is
   very fruitful of consequences. (1.) As all virtue consists in
   benevolence, happiness must be the highest good. Holiness is good only
   because it tends to happiness. It has no virtue of its own. (2.)
   Whatever tends to promote happiness is right. There is no such thing as
   sin. What we call sin, if a necessary means of the greatest good,
   becomes virtue. It is evil only so far as it has a contrary tendency.
   And as under the government of God all sin, past or present, does so
   cure a greater amount of happiness than would otherwise be possible,
   there is really no sin in the universe. (3.) This is generalized into
   the principle that it is right to do evil that good may come. This is
   the principle on which God acts, according to this theory, and it is
   the principle on which men are entitled and bound to act; and on which
   in point of fact they do act. The question which on every occasion
   their doctrine presents for decision is necessarily, What will be the
   consequence of a certain act or course of conduct? Will it promote
   happiness or the reverse? and the answer decides the course to be
   pursued. The Jesuits have worked out this theory into a science, and
   are enabled to determine beforehand when murder, perjury, and blasphemy
   become virtues. As this doctrine revolts the moral sense, its adoption
   is necessarily degrading. Few principles, therefore, have been so
   productive of false doctrine and immorality as the principle that all
   virtue consists in benevolence, that happiness is the highest good, and
   that whatever promotes happiness is right.

   The Scriptural Doctrine as to the Design of Creation.

   It is obviously in vain for man to attempt to determine the design of
   the creation from the nature of God's works and from the course of his
   providence. That would require a knowledge of the whole universe and of
   its history to its consummation. The only satisfactory method of
   determining the question is by appealing to the Scriptures. There it is
   explicitly taught that the glory of God, the manifestation of his
   perfections, is the last end of all his works. This is, (1.) The
   highest possible end. The knowledge of God is eternal life. It is the
   source of all holiness and all blessedness to rational creatures. (2.)
   This in the Bible is declared to be the end of the universe as a whole;
   of the external world or works of nature; of the plan of redemption; of
   the whole course of history: of the mode in which God administers his
   providence and dispenses his grace; and of particular events, such as
   the choice of the Israelites and all the dealings of God with them as a
   nation. It is the end which all rational creatures are commanded to
   keep constantly in view; and it comprehends and secures all other right
   ends. The common objection, that this doctrine represents God as
   self-seeking, has already been answered. God, as infinitely wise and
   good, seeks the highest end; and as all creatures are as the dust of
   the balance compared to Him, it follows that his glory is an infinitely
   higher end than anything that concerns them exclusively. For a creature
   to seek his own glory or happiness in preference to that of God, is
   folly and sin, because he is utterly insignificant. He prefers a trifle
   to what is of infinite importance. He sacrifices, or endeavours to
   sacrifice, an end which involves the highest excellence of all
   creatures, to his own advantage. He serves the creature more than the
   Creator. He prefers himself to God. Many theologians endeavour to
   combine these different views as to the design of the creation. They
   say that the highest end is the glory of God, and the subordinate end
   the good of his creatures. Or, they say that the two are the same. God
   purposes to glorify Himself in the happiness of his creatures; or to
   promote the happiness of his creatures as a means of manifesting his
   glory. But this is only to confuse and confound the matter. The end is
   one thing; the consequences another. The end is the glory of God; the
   consequences of the attainment of that end are undoubtedly the highest
   good (not necessarily the greatest amount of happiness), and that
   highest good may include much sin and much misery so far as individuals
   are concerned. But the highest good is that God should be known.

   § 6. The Mosaic Account of the Creation.

   There are three methods of interpreting this portion of the Bible. (1.)
   The historical. (2.) The allegorical. (3.) The mythical. The first
   assumes it to be a veritable history. The second has two forms. Many of
   the Fathers who allegorized the whole of the Old Testament without
   denying its historical verity, allegorized in like manner the history
   of the creation. That is, they sought for a hidden moral or spiritual
   sense under all historical facts. Others regarded it as purely an
   allegory without any historical basis, any more than the parables of
   our Lord. The mythical theory, as the name imports, regards the record
   of the creation as a mere fable, or fabulous cosmogony, designed to
   express a theory as to the origin of the universe, of man, and of evil,
   of no more value than the similar cosmogonies which are found in the
   early literature of all nations. In favour of the historical character
   of the record are the following considerations, (1.) It purports to be
   a veritable history. (2.) It is the appropriate and necessary
   introduction or an acknowledged history. (3.) It is referred to and
   quoted in other parts of the Bible as the true account of the creation
   of the world; especially in the fourth commandment, where, as well as
   in other parts of Scripture, it is made the foundation of the
   institution of the Sabbath. (4.) The facts here recorded, including as
   they do the creation and probation of man, lie at the foundation of the
   whole revealed plan of redemption. The whole Bible, therefore, rests
   upon the record here given of the work of creation, and consequently
   all the evidence which goes to support the divine authority of the
   Bible, tends to sustain the historical verity of that record.

   Objections to the Mosaic Account of the Creation.

   The principal objections to the Mosaic account of the creation are
   either critical, astronomical, or geological. Under the first head it
   is objected that the account is inconsistent with itself, especially in
   what is said of the creation of man; and that it is evidently composed
   of independent documents, in one of which God is called 'lhym, and in
   the other yhvh. The former of these objections is answered by showing
   that the two accounts of the creation are not inconsistent; the one is
   a concise statement of the fact, the other a fuller account of the
   manner of its occurrence. As to the second objection, it is enough to
   say that, admitting the fact on which it is founded, it creates no
   difficulty in the way of acknowledging the historical character of the
   record. It is of no importance to us whence Moses derived his
   information, whether from one or more historical documents, from
   tradition, or from direct revelation. We receive the account on his
   authority and on the authority of the Book of which it is a recognized
   and authentic portion.

   The astronomical objections are, (1.) That the whole account evidently
   assumes that our earth is the centre of the universe, and that the sun,
   moon, and stars are its satellites. (2.) That light is said to have
   been created and the alternation between day and night established
   before the creation of the sun; and (3.) That the visible heavens are
   represented as a solid expanse. The first of these objections bears
   with as much force against all the representations of the Bible and the
   language of common life. Men instinctively form their language
   according to apparent, and not absolute or scientific truth. They speak
   of the sun as rising and setting; of its running its course through the
   heavens, although they know that this is only apparently and not really
   true. The language of the Bible on this, as well as on all other
   subjects, is framed in accordance with the common usage of men. The
   second objection is founded on the assumption that the fourteenth verse
   speaks of the creation of the sun and other heavenly bodies. This is
   not its necessary meaning. The sense may be that God then appointed the
   sun and moon to the service of measuring and regulating times and
   seasons. But even if the other interpretation be adopted, there need be
   no conflict between the record and the astronomical fact that the sun
   is now the source of light to the world. The narrative makes a
   distinction between the cosmical light mentioned in the earlier part of
   the chapter, and the light enanating from the sun, specially designed
   for our globe. The third objection is met by the remark already made.
   If we speak of the concave heavens, why might not the Hebrews speak of
   the solid heavens? The word firmament applied to the visible heavens is
   as familiar to us as it was to them. Calvin well remarks, "Moses vulgi
   ruditati se accommodans, non alia Dei opera commemorat in historia
   creationis, nisi quæ oculis nostris occurrunt." [527]

   Geology and the Bible.

   The geological objections to the Mosaic record are apparently the most
   serious. According to the commonly received chronology, our globe has
   existed only a few thousand years. According to geologists, it must
   have existed for countless ages. And again, according to the generally
   received interpretation of the first chapter of Genesis, the process of
   creation was completed in six days, whereas geology teaches that it
   must have been in progress through periods of time which cannot be
   computed.

   Admitting the facts to be as geologists would have us to believe, two
   methods of reconciling the Mosaic account with those facts have been
   adopted. First, some understand the first verse to refer to the
   original creation of the matter of the universe in the indefinite past,
   and what follows to refer to the last reorganizing change in the state
   of our earth to fit it for the habitation of man. Second, the word day
   as used throughout the chapter is understood of geological periods of
   indefinite duration.

   In favour of this latter view it is urged that the word day is used in
   Scripture in many different senses; sometimes for the time the sun is
   above the horizon; sometimes for a period of twenty-four hours;
   sometimes for a year, as in Lev. xxv. 29, Judges xvii. 10, and often
   elsewhere; sometimes for an indefinite period, as in the phrases, "the
   day of your calamity," "the day of salvation," "the day of the Lord,"
   "the day of judgment." And in this account of the creation it is used
   for the period of light in antithesis to night; for the separate
   periods in the progress of creation; and then, ch. ii. 4, for the whole
   period: "In the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens."

   It is of course admitted that, taking this account by itself, it would
   be most natural to understand the word in its ordinary sense; but if
   that sense brings the Mosaic account into conflict with facts, and
   another sense avoids such conflict, then it is obligatory on us to
   adopt that other. Now it is urged that if the word "day" be taken in
   the sense of "an indefinite period of time," a sense which it
   undoubtedly has in other parts of Scripture, there is not only no
   discrepancy between the Mosaic account of the creation and the assumed
   facts of geology, but there is a most marvellous coincidence between
   them.

   The cosmogony of modern science teaches that the universe, "the heaven
   and the earth," was first in a chaotic or gaseous state. The process of
   its development included the following steps: (1.) "Activity begun, --
   light an immediate result. (2.) The earth made an independent sphere.
   (3.) Outlining of the land and water, determining the earth's general
   configuration. (4.) The idea of life in the lowest plants, and
   afterwards, if not contemporaneously, in the lowest or systemless
   animals, or Protozoans. (5.) The energizing light of the sun shining on
   the earth -- an essential preliminary to the display of the systems of
   life. (6.) lntroduction of the systems of life. (7.) Introduction of
   mammals -- the highest order of the vertebrates, -- the class
   afterwards to be dignified by including a being of moral and
   intellectual nature. (8.) Introduction of man." [528]

   Professor Dana further says, "The order of events in the Scripture
   cosmogony corresponds essentially with that which has been given. There
   was first a void and formless earth: this was literally true of the
   heavens and the earth, if they were in the condition of a gaseous
   fluid. The succession is as follows: --

   "1. Light.

   "2. The dividing of the waters below from the waters above the earth
   (the word translated waters may mean fluid).

   "3. The dividing of the land and water on the earth.

   "4. Vegetation; which Moses, appreciating the philosophical
   characteristic of the new creation distinguishing it from previous
   inorganic substances, defines as that which had seed in itself.'

   "5. The sun, moon, and stars.

   "6. The lower animals, those that swarm in the waters, and the creeping
   and flying species of the land.

   "7. Beasts of prey (creeping' here meaning prowling).

   "8. Man.

   "In this succession, we observe not merely an order of events, like
   that deduced from science; there is a system in the arrangement, and a
   far-reaching prophecy, to which philosophy could not nave attained,
   however instructed.

   "The account recognizes in creation two great eras of three days each,
   -- an Inorganic and an Organic. Each of these eras open with the
   appearance of light; the first, light cosmical; the second, light from
   the sun for the special uses of the earth.

   "Each era ends in a day' of two great works -- the two shown to be
   distinct by being severally pronounced good.' On the third day, that
   closing the Inorganic Era, there was first the dividing of the land
   from the waters, and afterwards the creation of vegetation, or the
   institution of a kingdom of life -- a work widely diverse fromn all
   that preceded it in the era. So on the sixth day, terminating the
   Organic Era, there was first the creation of mammals, and then a second
   far greater work, totally new in its grandest element, the creation of
   Man.

   "The arrangement is, then, as follows: --

   "I. The Inorganic Era.

   "1st Day. -- Light cosmical.

   "2d Day. -- The earth divided from the fluid around it, or
   indvidualized.

   "3d Day. -- {

                 "1. Outlining of the land and water.

                 2. Creation of vegetation.

   "II. The Organic Era.

   "4th Day. -- Light from the sun.

   "5th Day. -- Creation of the lower order of animals.

   "6th Day. -- {

                  1. Creation of mammals.

                  2. Creation of man."

   "The record in the Bible," adds Professor Dana, [529] "is therefore
   profoundly philosophical in the scheme of creation which it presents.
   It is both true and divine. It is a declaration of authorship, both of
   creation and the Bible, on the first page of the sacred volume." [530]
   To the same effect he elsewhere says: "The first thought that strikes
   the scientific reader [of the Mosaic account of the creation] is the
   evidence of divinity, not merely in the first verse of the record, and
   the successive fiats, but in the whole order of creation. There is so
   much that the most recent readings of science have for the first time
   explained, that the idea of man as the author becomes utterly
   incomprehensible. By proving the record true, science pronounces it
   divine; for who could have correctly narrated the secrets of eternity
   but God himself?" [531]

   The views given in his "Manual of Geology" are more fully elaborated by
   Professor Dana in two admirable articles in the "Bibliotheca Sacra"
   (January and July, 1856). He says, in the former of those articles,
   "The best views we have met with on the harmony between science and the
   Bible, are those of Professor Arnold Guyot, a philosopher of enlarged
   comprehension of nature and a truly Christian spirit; and the following
   interpretations of the sacred record are, in the main, such as we have
   gathered from personal intercourse with him." [532]

   Professor Dana of Yale and Professor Guyot of Princeton, belong to the
   first rank of scientific naturalists; and the friends of the Bible owe
   them a debt of gratitude for their able vindication of the sacred
   record.

   As the Bible is of God, it is certain that there can be no conflict
   between the teachings of the Scriptures and the facts of science. It is
   not with Facts, but with theories, believers have to contend. Many such
   theories have, from time to time, been presented, apparently or really
   inconsistent with the Bible. But these theories have either proved to
   be false, or to harmonize with the Word of God, properly interpreted.
   The Church has been forced more than once to alter her interpretation
   of the Bible to accommodate the discoveries of science. But this has
   been done without doing any violence to the Scriptures or in any degree
   impairing their authority. Such change, however, cannot be effected
   without a struggle. It is impossible that our mode of understanding the
   Bible should not be determined by our views of the subjects of which it
   treats. So long as men believed that the earth was the centre of our
   system, the sun its satellite, and the stars its ornamentation, they of
   necessity understood the Bible in accordance with that hypothesis. But
   when it was discovered that the earth was only one of the smaller
   satellites of the sun, and that the stars were worlds, then faith,
   although at first staggered, soon grew strong enough to take it all in,
   and rejoice to find that the Bible, and the Bible alone of all ancient
   books, was in full accord with these stupendous revelations of science.
   And so if it should be proved that the creation was a process continued
   through countless ages, and that the Bible alone of all the books of
   antiquity recognized that fact, then, as Professor Dana says, the idea
   of its being of human origin would become "utterly incomprehensible."

CHAPTER XI.

  PROVIDENCE.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Preservation.

   God's works of providence are his most holy, wise, and powerful
   preserving and governing all his creatures and all their actions.
   Providence, therefore, includes preservation and government. By
   preservation is meant that all things out of God owe the continuance of
   their existence, with all their properties and powers, to the will of
   God. This is clearly the doctrine of the Scriptures. The passages
   relating to this subject are very numerous. They are of different
   kinds. First, some assert in general terms that God does sustain all
   things by the word of his power, as Heb. i. 3; Col. i. 17, where it is
   said, "By Him all things consist," or continue to be. In Nehem. ix. 6,
   "Thou, even thou art Lord alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of
   heavens, with all their hosts, the earth, and all things that are
   therein, the seas, and all that is there in, and thou preservest them
   all." Secondly, those which refer to the regular operations or powers
   of nature, which are declared to be preserved in their efficiency by
   the power of God. See Psalms civ. and cxlviii. throughout, and many
   similar passages. Thirdly, those which relate to irrational animals.
   And Fourthly, those which relate to rational creatures, who are said to
   live, move, and to have their being in God. These passages clearly
   teach, (1.) That the universe as a whole does not continue in being of
   itself. It would cease to exist if unsupported by his power. (2.) That
   all creatures, whether plants or animals, in their several genera,
   species, and individuals, are continued in existence not by any
   inherent principle of life, but by the will of God. (3.) That this
   preservation extends not only to the substance but also to the form;
   not only to the essence, but also to the qualities, properties, and
   powers of all created things.

   The Nature of Preservation.

   This doctrine, thus clearly taught in the Scriptures, is so consonant
   to reason and to the religious nature of man, that is not denied among
   Christians. The only question is as to the nature of the divine
   efficiency to which the continued existence of all things is to be
   referred. On this subject there are three general opinions.

   First, That of those who assume that everything is to be referred to
   the original purpose of God. He created all things and determined that
   they should continue in being according to the laws which He impressed
   upon them at the beginning. There is no need, it is said, of supposing
   his continued intervention for their preservation. It is enough that He
   does not will that they should cease to be. This is the theory adopted
   by the Remonstrants and generally by the Deists of modern times.
   According to this view, God is seated on his throne in the heavens, a
   mere spectator of the world and of its operations, exerting no direct
   efficiency in sustaining the things which He has made. Thus Limborch
   [533] decribes preservation, as held by many, to be merely an "actus
   negativus . . . . [quo Deus] essentias, vires ac facultates rerum
   creatarum non vult destruere; sed eas vigori suo per creationem indito,
   quoad usque ille perdurare potest relinquere." To this view it is to be
   objected, --

   1. That it is obviously opposed to the representations of the Bible.
   According to the uniform and pervading teaching of the Scriptures, God
   is not merely a God afar off. He is not a mere spectator of the
   universe which He has made, but is everywhere present in his essence,
   knowledge, and power. To his sustaining hand the continuance of all
   things is constantly referred; and if He withdraws his presence they
   cease to be. This is so plainly the doctrine of the Bible that it is
   admitted so to be by many whose philosophical views constrain them to
   reject the doctrine for themselves.

   2. It is inconsistent with the absolute dependence of all things on
   God. It supposes creatures to have within themselves a principle of
   life, derived originally, indeed, from God, but capable of continued
   being and power without his aid. The God of the Bible is everywhere
   declared to be the all-sustaining ground of all that is, so that if not
   upheld by the word of his power, they would cease to be. The Scriptures
   expressly distinguish the power by which things were created from that
   by which they are continued. All things were not only created by Him,
   says the Apostle, but by Him all things consist. (Col. i. 17.) This
   language clearly teaches that the almighty power of God is as much
   concerned in the continued existence, as in the original creation of
   all things.

   3. This doctrine does violence to the instinctive religious convictions
   of all men. Even those the least enlightened live and act under the
   conviction of absolute dependence. They recognize God as everywhere
   present and everywhere active. If they do not love and trust Him, they
   at least fear Him and instinctively deprecate his wrath. They cannot,
   without doing violence to the constitution of their nature, look upon
   God as a being who is a mere spectator of the creatures who owe their
   existence to his will.

   Preservation not a Continued Creation.

   A second view of the nature of preservation goes to the opposite
   extreme of confounding creation and preservation. This opinion has been
   held in different forms, --

   1. It is sometimes said that preservation and creation are to be
   referred to one and the same divine act. So far, therefore, as God is
   concerned, the two are identical. This ground is taken by many who
   admit the reality of the world and the efficiency of second causes.
   They intend by this mode of representation to deny any succession in
   the acts of God. He cannot be viewed as acting in time, or as doing in
   time what He has not done from eternity.

   2. Others who represent preservation as a continued creation, only mean
   that the divine efficiency is as really active in the one case as in
   the other. They wish to deny that anything out of God has the cause of
   the continuance of its existence in itself; and that its properties or
   powers are in any such sense inherent as that they preserve their
   efficiency without the continued agency of God. This is the sense in
   which most of the Reformed theologians are to be understood when they
   speak of preservation as a continuous creation. Thus Heidegger [534]
   says, "Conservatio continuata creatio Dei activa est. Si enim creatio
   et conservatio duæ actiones distinctæ forent, creatio primo cessaret,
   ac tum conservatio vel eodem, quo creatio cessavit, vel sequenti
   momento inciperet." This only means that the world owes its continued
   existence to the uninterrupted exercise of the divine power. He
   therefore elsewhere says, "Conservationi annihilatio opponitur.
   Cessante actione conservante res in nihilum collabitur." In like manner
   Alsted [535] says, "Conservatio est quædam continuatio. Quemadmodum
   creatio est prima productio rei ex nihilo, ita est conservatio rei
   continuatio, ne in nihilum recidat. Deus mundum sustinet." Ryssenius
   (whose work is principally from Turrettin), [536] says "Providentia
   bene altera creatio, dicitur. Nam eadem voluntate, qua Deus omnia
   creavit, omnia conservat, et creatio a conservatione in eo tantum
   differt, quod quando voluntatem Dei sequitur rerum existentia, dicitur
   creatio; quando res eadem per eandem voluntatem durat, dicitur
   conservatio." This amounts only to saying that as God created all
   things by the word of his power, so also He upholds all things by the
   word of his power.

   3. There is, however, a third form in which this doctrine is held. By
   continued creation is meant that all efficiency is in God; that all
   effects are to be referred to his agency. As there was no coöperation
   in calling the world out of nothing, so there is no coöperation of
   second causes in its continuance and operations. God creates, as it
   were, de novo at each instant the universe, as at that moment it
   actually is.

   Objections to the Doctrine of a Continuous Creation.

   All these modes of representation, however, are objectionable.
   Creation, preservation, and government are in fact different, and to
   identify them leads not only to confusion but to error. Creation and
   preservation differ, first, as the former is the calling into existence
   what before did not exist; and the latter is continuing, or causing to
   continue what already has a being; and secondly, in creation there is
   and can be no coöperation, but in preservation there is a concursus of
   the first, with second causes. In the Bible, therefore, the two things
   are never confounded. God created all things, and by Him all things
   consist. As to the first mentioned of the three forms of the doctrine
   of a continued creation, it is enough to remark that it rests on the à
   priori idea of an absolute Being. It is not only a gratuitous, but an
   unscriptural assumption which denies all difference between will and
   efficiency, or between power and act in God. And as to the idea that
   God's acts are not successive; that He never does in time what He does
   not do from eternity, it is obvious that such language has for us no
   meaning. We cannot comprehend the relation which the efficiency of God
   has to the effects produced successively. We know, however, that God
   acts; that He does produce successive effects; and that, so far as we
   are concerned, and so far as the representations of scripture are
   concerned, our relation to God and the relation of the world to Him,
   are precisely what they would be if his acts were really successive. It
   is the height of presumption in man, on the mere ground of our
   speculative ideas, to depart from the plain representations of
   Scriptures, and so to conceive of the relation of God to the world as
   effectually to make Him an unknown Being, merging all his perfections
   into the general idea of cause.

   The objection to the second form of the doctrine is not to the idea
   meant to be expressed. It is true that the preservation of the world is
   as much due to the immediate power of God as its creation, but this
   does not prove that preservation is creation. Creation is the
   production of something out of nothing. Preservation is the upholding
   in existence what already is. This form of the doctrine is therefore a
   false use of terms. A more serious objection, however, is that this
   mode of expression tends to error. The natural sense of the words is
   what those who use them admit to be false, and not only false but
   dangerous.

   To the real doctrine of a continuous creation the objections are far
   more serious, --

   1. It destroys all continuity of existence. If God creates any given
   thing every moment out of nothing, it ceases to be the same thing. It
   is something new, however similar to what existed before. It is as much
   disconnected from what preceded it as the world itself when it arose
   out of nothing, was disconnected from the previous nothingness.

   2. This doctrine effectually destroys all evidence of the existence of
   an external world. What we so regard, the impressions on our senses
   which we refer to things out of ourselves, are merely inward states of
   consciousness produced momentarily by the creating energy of God.
   Idealism is, therefore, the logical, as it has been the historical
   consequence of the theory in question. If all necessity for the
   existence of an external world is done away with, that existence must
   be discarded as an unphilosophical assumption.

   3. This theory of course denies the existence of second causes. God
   becomes the sole agent and the sole cause in the universe. The heavens
   and earth with all their changes and with all they contain, are but the
   pulsations of the universal life of God. If preservation be a continued
   production out of nothing, of everything that exists, then every
   material existence, all properties of matter so called, every human
   soul, and every human thought and feeling, is as much the direct
   product of divine omnipotence as the original creation. There cannot,
   therefore, be any causation out of God, or any coöperation of any kind
   any more than when He said, Let there be light, and there was light. In
   the same manner He constantly now says, Let men exist with all the
   thoughts, purposes, and feelings, which constitute their nature and
   character for the time being, and they are.

   4. On this theory there can be no responsibility, no sin and no
   holiness. If sin exist, it must be referred to God as much as holiness,
   for all is due to his creating energy.

   5. Between this system and Pantheism there is scarcely a dividing line.
   Pantheism merges the universe in God, but not more effectually than the
   doctrine of a continuous creation. God in the one case as truly as in
   the other, is all that lives. There is no power, no cause, no real
   existence but the efficiency and causality of God. This is obvious, and
   is generally admitted. Hagenbach [537] says, "Creation out of nothing
   rests on Theism. It becomes deistic if creation and preservation are
   violently separated and placed in direct opposition to each other; and
   pantheistic if creation be made a mere moment in preservation." "In
   creation," says Strauss, "God works all, the creature which is thus
   first produced, nothing." If, therefore, preservation is only the
   continuance of the same relation between God and the creature, it
   follows that God still effects everything and the creature nothing;
   hence out of God, or other than God, there are no causes, not even
   occasional. Leibnitz, [538] quotes Bayle as saying, "Il me semble,
   qu'il en faut conclure, que Dieu fait tout, et qu'il n'y a point dans
   toutes les créatures de causes premières, ni secondes, ni même
   occasionelles." And again, "On ne peut dire que Dieu me crée
   premièrement, et qu' étant crée, il produise avec moi mes mouvemens et
   mes déterminations. Cela est insoutenable pour deux raisons: la
   première est, que quand Dieu me crée on me conserve à cet instant, il
   ne me conserve pas comme un être sans forme, comme une espèce ou
   quelque autre des universaux de logique. Je suis un individu; il me
   crée et conserve comme tel, étant tout ce que je suis dans cet instant
   avec toutes mes dépendances." To make preservation, therefore, a
   continued creation, leads to conclusions opposed to the essential
   truths of religion, and at variance with our necessary beliefs. We are
   forced by the constitution of our nature to believe in the external
   world and in the reality of second causes. We know from consciousness
   that we are the responsible authors of our own acts, and that we
   continue identically the same substance, and consequently are not
   created out of nothing from moment to moment.

   This subject will come up again when treating of President Edwards'
   theory of identity, and its application to the relation between Adam
   and his race.

   Scriptural Doctrine of the Subject

   Between the two extremes of representing preservation as a mere
   negative act, a not willing to destroy, which denies any continued
   efficiency of God in the world; and the theory which resolves
   everything into the immediate agency of God, denying the reality of all
   second causes, is the plain doctrine of the Scriptures, which teaches
   that the continuance of the world in existence, the preservation of its
   substance, properties, and forms, is to be referred to the omnipresent
   power of God. He upholds as He creates all things, by the word of his
   power. How He does this it is vain to inquire. So long as we cannot
   tell how we move our lips, or how mind can operate on matter, or in
   what way the soul is present and operative in the whole body, it
   requires little humility to suppress the craving curiosity to know how
   God sustains the universe with all its hosts in being and activity. The
   theologians of the seventeenth century endeavoured to explain this by a
   general concursus, or, as they called it, influx of God into all his
   creatures. It is said to be an "Actus positivus et directus, quo Deus
   in genere in causas efficientes rerum conservandas influxu vero et
   reali influit, ut in natura, proprietatibus et viribus suis persistant
   ac permaneant." [539] But what do we gain by saying that the soul by "a
   true and real influx" operates in every part of the body. The fact is
   clearly revealed that God's agency is always and everywhere exercised
   in the preservation of his creatures, but the mode in which his
   efficiency is exerted, further than that it is consistent with the
   nature of the creatures themselves and with the holiness and goodness
   of God, is unrevealed and inscrutable. It is best, therefore, to rest
   satisfied with the simple statement that preservation is that
   omnipotent energy of God by which all created things, animate and
   inanimate, are upheld in existence, with all the properties and powers
   with which He has endowed them.

   § 2. Government.

   Statement of the Doctrine.

   Providence includes not only preservation, but government. The latter
   includes the ideas of design and control. It supposes an end to be
   attained, and the disposition and direction of means for its
   accomplishment. If God governs the universe He has some great end,
   including an indefinite number of subordinate ends, towards which it is
   directed, and He must control the sequence of all events, so as to
   render certain the accomplishment of all his purposes. Of this
   providential government the Scriptures teach, (1.) That it is
   universal, including all the creatures of God, and all their actions.
   The external world, rational and irrational creatures, things great and
   small, ordinary and extraordinary, are equally and always under the
   control of God. The doctrine of providence excludes both necessity and
   chance from the universe, substituting for them the intelligent and
   universal control of an infinite, omnipresent God. (2.) The Scriptures
   also teach that this government of God is powerful. It is the universal
   sway of omnipotence which renders certain the accomplishment of his
   designs, which embrace in their compass everything that occurs. (3.)
   That it is wise; which means not only that the ends which God has in
   view are consistent with his infinite wisdom, and that the means
   employed are wisely adapted to their respective objects, but also that
   his control is suited to the nature of the creatures over which it is
   exercised. He governs the material world according to fixed laws which
   He himself has established; irrational animals by their instincts, and
   rational creatures agreeably to their nature. (4.) God's providence is
   holy. That is, there is nothing in the ends proposed, the means
   adopted, or the agency employed, inconsistent with his infinite
   holiness, or which the highest moral excellence does not demand. This
   is all that the Scriptures reveal on this most important and difficult
   subject. And here it were well could the subject be allowed to rest. It
   is enough for us to know that God does govern all his creatures and all
   their actions, and that his government while absolutely efficacious is
   infinitely wise and good, directed to secure the highest ends, and
   perfectly consistent with his own perfections and with the nature of
   his creatures. But men have insisted upon answering the questions, How
   does God govern the world? What is the relation between his agency and
   the efficiency of second causes? and especially, How can God's absolute
   control be reconciled with the liberty of rational agents? These are
   questions which never can be solved. But as philosophers insist upon
   answering them, it becomes necessary for theologians to consider those
   answers, and to show their fallacy when they conflict with the
   established facts of revelation and experience. Before considering the
   more important of the theories which have been advanced to explain the
   nature of God's providential government, and his relation to the world,
   it will be proper to present a brief outline of the argument, in
   support of the truth of the doctrine as stated above.

   A. Proof of the Doctrine.

   This doctrine necessarily flows from the Scriptural idea of God. He is
   declared to be a personal being, infinite in wisdom, goodness, and
   power; to be the Father of Spirits. From this it follows not only that
   He acts intelligently, i.e., with a view to an end, and on sufficient
   reasons, but that He must be concerned for the good of creatures
   rational and irrational, great and small. The idea that God would
   create this vast universe teeming with life in all its forms, and
   exercise no control over it, to secure it from destruction or from
   working out nothing but evil, is utterly inconsistent with the nature
   of God. And to suppose that anything is too great to be comprehended in
   his control, or anything so minute as to escape his notice; or that the
   infinitude of particulars can distract his attention, is to forget that
   God is infinite. It cannot require any effort in Him, the omnipresent
   and infinite intelligence, to comprehend and to direct all things
   however complicated, numerous, or minute. The sun diffuses its light
   through all space as easily as upon any one point. God is as much
   present everywhere, and with everything, as though He were only in one
   place, and had but one object of attention. The common objection to the
   doctrine of a universal providence, founded on the idea that it is
   incompatible with the dignity and majesty of the divine Being to
   suppose that He concerns himself about trifles, assumes that God is a
   limited being; that because we can attend to only one thing at a time,
   it must be so with God. The more exalted are our conceptions of the
   divine Being, the less shall we be troubled with difficulties of this
   kind.

   Proof from the Evidence of the Operation of Mind everywhere.

   The whole universe, so far as it can be subjected to our observation,
   exhibits evidence of God's omnipresent intelligence and control. Mind
   is everywhere active. There is everywhere manifest the intelligent
   adaptation of means to an end; as well in the organization of the
   animalcule which it requires the microscope to reveal, as in the order
   of the heavenly bodies. This mind is not in matter. It is not a blind
   vis naturæ. It is, and must be the intelligence of an infinite,
   omnipresent Being. It is just as much beyond the power of a creature to
   form an insect, as it is to create the universe. And it is as
   unreasonable to assume that the organized forms of the vegetable and
   animal worlds are due to the laws of nature, as it would be to assume
   that a printing-press could be constructed to compose a poem. There is
   no adaptation or relation between the means and the end. Wherever there
   is the intelligent adaptation of means to an end, there is evidence of
   the presence of mind. And as such evidence of mental activity is found
   in every part of the universe, we see God ever active and everywhere
   present in all his works.

   Argument from our Religious Nature.

   The Scriptural doctrine of a universal providence is demanded by the
   religious nature of man. It is therefore an instinctive and necessary
   belief. It is banished from the mind, or overruled only by persistent
   effort. In the first place, we cannot but regard it as a limitation of
   God to suppose Him absent either as to knowledge or power from any part
   of his creation. In the second place, our sense of dependence involves
   the conviction not only that we owe our existence to his will, but that
   it is in Him that we and all his creatures live, move, and have our
   being. In the third place, our sense of responsibility implies that God
   is cognizant of all our thoughts, words, and actions, and that He
   controls all our circumstances and our destiny both in this life and in
   the life to come. This conviction is instinctive and universal. It is
   found in men of all ages, and under all forms of religion, and in all
   states of civilization. Men universally believe in the moral government
   of God; and they universally believe that that moral government is
   administered at least in part, in this world. They see that God often
   restrains or punishes the wicked. Did this man sin, or his parents,
   that he was born blind? was the utterance of a natural feeling; the
   expression, although erroneous as to its form, of the irrepressible
   conviction that everything is ordered by God. In the fourth place, our
   religious nature demands intercourse with God. He must be to us the
   object of prayer, and the ground of confidence. We must look to Him in
   trouble and danger; we cannot refrain from calling upon Him for help,
   or thanking Him for our mercies. Unless the doctrine of a universal
   providence be true, all this is a delusion. Such, however, is the
   relation in which the Scripture. and the constitution of our nature
   assume that we stand to God, and in which He stands to the world. He is
   ever present, all-controlling, the hearer and answerer of prayer,
   giving us our daily mercies, and guiding us in all our ways. This
   doctrine of providence, therefore, is the foundation of all practical
   religion, and the denial of it is practically atheism, for we are then
   without God in the world. It may be said that these religious feelings
   are due to our education; that men educated in the belief of witches
   and fairies, or supernatural agencies of any kind, refer events
   actually due to the operations of nature to the intervention of
   spiritual beings. To this it may be answered, First, that the sense of
   dependence, of responsibility, of obligation for mercies received, and
   of the control of outward events by the power of God, is too universal
   to be accounted for by any peculiar form of education. These are the
   generic, or fundamental convictions of the human mind, which are
   manifested in more or less suitable forms, according to the degree of
   knowledge which different men possess. And secondly, it is to be
   considered that the argument is founded on the truth and justness of
   these feelings, and not on their origin. It is in this case as it is
   with our moral convictions. Because our knowledge of what is right or
   wrong, and the opinions of men on that point, may be modified by
   education and circumstances, this does not prove that our moral nature
   is due to education; nor does it shake the convictions we entertain of
   the correctness of our moral judgments. It may be, and doubtless is
   true that we owe to the Scriptures most of our knowledge of the moral
   law, but this does not impair our confidence in the authority and truth
   of our views of duty, and of moral obligation. These religious feelings
   have a self-evidencing as well as an informing light. We know that they
   are right, and we know that the doctrine which accords with them and
   produces them, must be true. It is, therefore, a valid argument for the
   doctrine of a universal providence that it meets the demands of our
   moral and religious nature.

   Argument from Predictions and Promises.

   A fourth general argument on this subject is derived from the
   predictions, promises, and threatenings recorded in the Word of God.
   Those predictions are not mere general declarations of the probable or
   natural consequences of certain courses of action, but specific
   revelations of the occurrence of events in the future, the futurition
   of which cannot be secured except in the exercise of an absolutely
   certain control over causes and agents both natural and moral. God
   promises to give health, long life and prosperous seasons; or He
   threatens to inflict severe judgments, the desolations of war, famine,
   drought, and pestilence. Such promises and threatenings suppose a
   universal providence, a control over all the creatures of God, and over
   all their actions. As such promises and threatenings abound in the Word
   of God; as his people, and as all nations recognize such benefits or
   calamities as divine dispensations, it is evident that the doctrine of
   Providence underlies all religion, both natural and revealed.

   Argument from Experience.

   We may refer confidently on this subject to all experiences. Every man
   can see that his life has been ordered by an intelligence and will not
   his own. His whole history has been determined by events over which he
   had no control, events often in themselves apparently fortuitous, so
   that he must either assume that the most important events are
   determined by chance, or admit that the providence of God extends to
   all events, even the most minute. What is true of individuals is true
   of nations. The Old Testament is a record of God's providential
   dealings with the Hebrew people. The calling of Abraham, the history of
   the patriarchs, of Joseph, of the sojourn of the Israelites in Egypt,
   of their deliverance and journey through the wilderness, of their
   conquest of the land of Canaan, and their whole subsequent history, is
   a continuous record of the control of God over all their circumstances,
   -- a control which is represented as extending to all events. In like
   manner the history of the world reveals to an intelligent eye the
   all-pervading providence of God, as clearly as the heavens declare his
   majesty and power.

   B. The Scriptures teach God's Providence over Nature.

   We find that the Bible asserts that the providential agency of God is
   exercised over all the operations of nature. This is asserted with
   regard to the ordinary operations of physical laws: the motion of the
   heavenly bodies, the succession of the seasons, the growth and decay of
   the productions of the earth; and the falling of the rain, hail, and
   snow. It is He who guides Arcturus in his course, who makes the sun to
   rise, and the grass to grow. These events are represented as due to the
   omnipresent agency of God and are determined, not by chance, nor by
   necessity, but by his will. Paul says (Acts xiv. 17), that God "left
   not himself without witness" even among the heathen, "in that He did
   good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our
   hearts with food and gladness." Our Lord says (Matt. v. 45), God
   "maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain
   on the just and on the unjust." He clothes "the grass of the field,
   which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven." (Matt. vi. 30.)
   In like manner the more unusual and striking operations of natural
   laws, earthquakes, tempests, and pestilences, are said to be sent,
   governed, and determined by Him, so that all the effects which they
   produce are referred to his purpose. He makes the winds his messengers,
   and the lightnings are his ministering spirits. Even apparently
   fortuitous events, such as are determined by causes so rapid or so
   inappreciable as to elude our notice, the falling of the lot; the
   flight of an arrow; the number of the hairs of our heads, are all
   controlled by the omnipresent God. "Are not two sparrows sold for a
   farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your
   Father." (Matt. x. 29.)

   Providence extends over the Animal World.

   The Scriptures teach that irrational animals are the objects of God's
   providential care. He fashions their bodies, He calls them into the
   world, sustains them in being, and supplies their wants. In his hand is
   the life of every living thing. (Job xii. 10.) The Psalmist says (civ.
   21), "The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from
   God." Verses 27, 28, "These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give
   them their meat in due season. That thou givest them, they gather: thou
   openest thy hand, they are filled with good." Matt. vi. 26, "Behold the
   fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather
   into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them." Acts xvii. 25, "He
   giveth to all life and breath, and all things." Such representations
   are not to be explained away as poetical modes of expressing the idea
   that the laws of nature, as ordained of God, are so arranged as to meet
   the necessities of the animal creation, without any special
   intervention of his providence. It is not the fact, merely, that the
   world, as created by God, is adapted to meet the wants of his
   creatures, that is asserted in the Scriptures, but that his creatures
   depend on the constant exercise of his care. He gives or withholds what
   they need according to his good pleasure. When our Lord put in the lips
   of his disciples the petition, "Give us this day our daily bread," He
   recognized the fact that all living creatures depend on the constant
   intervention of God for the supply of their daily wants.

   Over Nations.

   The Bible teaches that the providential government of God extends over
   nations and communities of men. Ps. lxvi. 7, "He ruleth by his power
   forever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt
   themselves." Dan. iv. 35, "He doeth according to his will in the army
   of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth." Dan. ii. 21, "He
   changeth the times and the seasons; He removeth kings and setteth up
   kings." Dan. iv. 25, "The Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men and
   giveth it to whomsoever He will." Is. x. 5, 6, "O Assyrian, the rod of
   mine anger, and the staff in their hand is my indignation, I will send
   him against an hypocritical nation." Verse 7, "Howbeit he meaneth not
   so, neither doth his heart think so." Verse 15, "Shall the axe boast
   itself against him that heweth therewith? or shall the saw magnify
   itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake itself
   against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself
   as though it were not wood." The Scriptures are full of this doctrine.
   God uses the nations with the absolute control that a man uses a rod or
   a staff. They are in his hands, and He employs them to accomplish his
   purposes. He breaks them in pieces as a potter's vessel, or He exalts
   them to greatness, according to his good pleasure.

   Over Individual.

   The providence of God extends not only over nations, but also over
   individuals. The circumstances of every man's birth, life, and death,
   are ordered by God. Whether we are born in a heathen or in a Christian
   land, in the Church or out of it; whether weak or strong; with many, or
   with few talents; whether we are prosperous or afflicted; whether we
   live a longer or a shorter time, are not matters determined by chance,
   or by the unintelligent sequence of events, but by the will of God. 1
   Sam. ii. 6, 7, "The Lord killeth and maketh alive: He bringeth down to
   the grave, and bringeth up. The Lord maketh poor and maketh rich, He
   bringeth low and lifteth up." Is. xlv. 5, "I am the Lord (the absolute
   ruler), and there is none else; there is no God besides me: I girded
   thee, though thou hast not known me." Prov. xvi. 9, "A man's heart
   deviseth his way: but the Lord directeth his steps." Ps. lxxv. 6, 7,
   "Promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from
   the south. But God is the judge (ruler): he putteth down one, and
   setteth up another." Ps. xxxi. 15, "My times (the vicissitudes of life)
   are in thy hands." Acts xvii. 26, God "hath made of one blood all
   nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath
   determined the times before appointed (i.e., the turning points in
   history) and the bounds of their habitation.

   God's Providence in relation to Free Acts.

   The Bible no less clearly teaches that God exercises a controlling
   power over the free acts of men, as well as over their external
   circumstances. This is true of all their acts, good and evil. It is
   asserted in general terms, that his dominion extends over their whole
   inward life, and especially over their good acts. Prov. xvi. 1, "The
   preparations of the heart in man and the answer of the tongue, is from
   the Lord." Prov. xxi. 1, "The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord,
   as the rivers of water: He turneth it whithersoever He will." Ezra vii.
   27, "Blessed be the Lord God of our fathers, which hath put such a
   thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the Lord."
   Ex. iii. 21 "I will give this people favour in the sight of the
   Egyptians." Ps. cxix. 36, "Incline thy heart unto thy testimonies." Ps.
   cxiv. 4, "Incline not my heart to any evil thing." A large part of the
   predictions, promises, and threatenings of the word of God are founded
   on the assumption of this absolute control over the free acts of his
   creatures. Without this there can be no government of the world and no
   certainty as to its issue. The Bible is filled with prayers founded on
   this same assumption. All Christians believe that the hearts of men are
   in the hand of God; that He works in them both to will and to do
   according to his good pleasure.

   The Relation of God's Providence to Sin.

   With regard to the sinful acts of men, the Scriptures teach, (1.) That
   they are so under the control of God that they can occur only by his
   permission and in execution of his purposes. He so guides them in the
   exercise of their wickedness that the particular forms of its
   manifestation are determined by his will. In 1 Chron. x. 4-14 it is
   said that Saul slew himself but it is elsewhere said that the Lord slew
   him and turned the kingdom unto David. So also it is said, that he
   hardened the heart of Pharaoh; that He hardened the spirit of Sihon the
   king of Heshbon; that He turned the hearts of the heathen to hate his
   people; that He blinds the eyes of men, and sends them strong delusion
   that they may believe a lie; that He stirs up the nations to war.
   "God," it is said, in Rev. xvii. 17, "hath put in their hearts to
   fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast,
   until the words of God shall be fulfilled." (2.) The Scriptures teach
   that the wickedness of men is restrained within prescribed bounds. Ps.
   lxxvi. 10, "Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of
   wrath shalt thou restrain." 2 Kings xix. 28, "Because thy rage against
   me, and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my
   hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back
   by the way by which thou camest." (3.) Wicked actions are overruled for
   good. The wicked conduct of Joseph's brethren, the obstinacy and
   disobedience of Pharaoh, the lust of conquest and thirst for plunder by
   which the heathen rulers were controlled in their invasions of the Holy
   Land; above all, the crucifixion of Christ, the persecutions of the
   Church, the revolutions and wars among the nations, have been all so
   overruled by Him who sitteth as ruler in the heavens, as to fulfil his
   wise and merciful designs. (4.) The Scriptures teach that God's
   providence in relation to the sins of men, is such that the sinfulness
   thereof proceedeth only from the creature and not from God; who neither
   is nor can be the author or approver of sin. 1 John ii. 16, "All that
   is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and
   the pride of life, is not of the Father (not from Him as its source or
   author), but is of the world." James i. 13, "Let no man say when he is
   tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil,
   neither tempteth he any man." Jer. vii. 9, "Will ye steal, murder, and
   commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and
   walk after other gods whom ye know not; and come and stand before me in
   this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do
   all these abominations?"

   Thus the fact that God does govern all his creatures and all their
   actions, is clearly revealed in the Scriptures. And that fact is the
   foundation of all religion. It is the ground of the consolation of his
   people in all ages; and it may be said to be the intuitive conviction
   of all men, however inconsistent it may be with their philosophical
   theories, or with their professions. The fact of this universal
   providence of God is all the Bible teaches. It nowhere attempts to
   inform us how it is that God governs all things, or how his effectual
   control is to be reconciled with the efficiency of second causes. All
   the attempts of philosophers and theologians to explain that point, may
   be pronounced failures, and worse than failures, for they not only
   raise more difficulties than they solve but in almost all instances
   they include principles or lead to conclusions inconsistent with the
   plain teachings of the word of God. These theories are all founded on
   some à priori principle which is assumed on no higher authority than
   human reason.

   § 3. Different Theories of the Divine Government.

   A. The Deistical Theory of God's Relation to the World.

   The first of the general views of God's relation to the world is that
   which has ever been widely adopted by Rationalists, Deists, and men of
   the world. It is founded on the assumption that the Supreme Being is
   too exalted to concern Himself with the trifling concerns of his
   creatures here on earth. He made the world and impressed upon it
   certain laws; endowing matter with its properties, and rational beings
   with the powers of free agency, and having done this, he leaves the
   world to the guidance of these general laws. According to this view,
   the relation which God bears to the universe is that of a mechanist to
   a machine. When an artist has made a watch it goes of itself, without
   his intervention. He is never called to interfere with its operation,
   except to remedy some defect. But as no such defect can be assumed in
   the works of God, there is no call for his intervention, and He does
   not interfere. All things come to pass in virtue of the operation of
   causes which He created and set in motion at the beginning. According
   to this view God in no wise determines the effects of natural causes,
   nor controls the acts of free agents. The reason that one season is
   propitious and the earth produces her fruits in abundance, and that
   another is the reverse; that one year pestilence sweeps over the land,
   and another year is exempted from such desolation; that of two ships
   sailing from the same port, the one is wrecked and the other has a
   prosperous voyage; that the Spanish Armada was dispersed by a storm and
   Protestant England saved from papal domination; that Cromwell and his
   companions were arrested and prevented from sailing for America, which
   decided the fate of religious liberty in Great Britain, -- that all
   such events are as they are, must, according to this theory, be
   referred to chance, or the blind operation of natural causes. God has
   nothing to do with them. He has abandoned the world to the government
   of physical laws and the affairs of men to their own control. This view
   of God's relation to the world is so thoroughly anti-Scriptural and
   irreligious that it never has been, and never can be adopted by any
   Christian church. So long as even the simple words of our Lord are
   remembered and believed, so long must this doctrine be rejected with
   indignation. "Consider the ravens; for they neither sow nor reap; which
   neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more
   are ye better than the fowls?" "Your Father knoweth that ye have need
   of these things. But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these
   things shall be added unto you." Our Lord, therefore, teaches us to
   confide in the universal providence of God which supplies the wants and
   controls the destiny of all his creatures, so that a hair does not fall
   from our heads without his notice.

   B. Theory of Entire Dependence.

   Another theory, the very opposite of the one just mentioned, is founded
   on the principle that absolute dependence includes the idea that God is
   the only cause. This principle has been widely adopted, even in the
   Church. It has been strenuously advocated by many theists, not only
   among the schoolmen, but by some of the Reformers, and by a large class
   of modern theologians. There was a class of the scholastic divines who
   were virtually pantheistic in their philosophical views. John Scotus
   Erigena had taught, in the ninth century, [540] that "omnis visibilis
   et invisibilis creatura theophania, i.e., divina apparitio recte potest
   appellari." He had his followers, even in the thirteenth century. [541]
   Those who did not go the length of asserting that "Deus est essentia
   omnium creaturarum et esse omnium," still maintained that He so
   operated in all as to be the only efficient cause. According to Thomas
   Aquinas, they argued, "Nulla insufficientia est Deo attribuenda. Si
   igitur Deus operatur in omni operante, sufficienter in quolibet
   operatur. Superfluum igitur esset quod agens creatum, aliquid
   operaretur." Again, "Quod Deum operari in quolibet operante, aliqui sic
   intellexerunt, quod nulla virtus creata aliquid operaretur in rebus,
   sed solus Deus immediate omnia operaretur: puta quod ignis non
   calefaceret, sed Deus in igne. Et similiter de omnibus aliis." [542] Of
   all the Reformers, Zwingle was the most inclined to this extreme view
   of the dependence of the creature on God. "Omnis virtus," he says,
   [543] "numinis virtus est, nec enim quicquam est quod non ex illo, in
   illo et per illud sit, imo illud ipsum sit -- creata inquam virtus
   dicitur, eo quod in novo subiecto et nova specie, universalis aut
   generalis ista virtus exhibetur. Deus est causa rerum universarum,
   reliqua omnia non sunt vere causæ. [544] Constat causas secundas non
   rite causas vocari. . . . . Essentiam, virtutem, et operationem habent
   non suam sed numinis. Instrumenta igitur sunt. [545] Viciniora ista,
   quibus causarum nomen damus, non jure causas esse sed manus et organa,
   quibus æterna mens operatur." [546] Calvin did not go so far, although
   he uses such language as the following, when speaking of inanimate
   things, "Sunt nihil aliud quam instrumuenta, quibus Deus assidue
   instillat quantum vult efficaciæ et pro suo arbitrio ad hanc vel illam
   actionem flectit et convertit." [547] He admits, however, that matter
   has its own properties, and second causes a real efficiency. The whole
   tendency of the Cartesian philosophy, which came into vogue in the
   seventeenth century, was to merge second causes into the first cause,
   and it thus led the way to idealism and pantheism. Malebranche
   admitted, on the testimony of Scripture, which declares that God
   created the heaven and the earth, that the external world has a real
   existence. But he denied that it could produce any effects, or that the
   soul could in any way act upon matter. We see all things in God. That
   is, when we perceive anything out of ourselves, the perception is not
   due to the impression made by the external object, but to the immediate
   agency of God. And the activity of our own minds is only a form of the
   activity of God. The first fruit of this system was avowed idealism, as
   all evidence of the existence of an external world was destroyed; and
   the second was the pantheism of Spinoza, which Leibnitz calls
   Cartesianism en outre. It must be admitted that the devout desire of
   the Reformed theologians to vindicate the sovereignty and supremacy of
   God, in opposition to all forms of Pelagian and semi-Pelagian doctrine,
   led many of them to go to an extreme in depreciating the efficiency of
   second causes, and in unduly exalting the omnipresent efficiency of
   God. Schweizer [548] represents the great body of the Reformed
   theologians as teaching that the dependence of creatures on the Creator
   supersedes all efficiency of second causes. "Die schlechthinige
   Abhängigkeit des Bestehens und Verlaufes der Welt gestattet keinerlei
   andere Ursächlichkeiten als nur die göttliche, so dass Zwischenursachen
   nur seine Instrumente und Organe sind, er die durch ihre Gesammtheit
   wie durch alle einzelnen Zwischenursachen allein hindurchwirkende
   Causalität. Dieses ist er vermöge der præsentia essentialis numinis
   oder doch divinæ virtutis, welche das Sein alles Seins, die Bewegung
   aller Bewegungen ist." This is Schweizer's own doctrine, as it is that
   of the whole school of Schleiermacher, to which he belongs; but that it
   is not the doctrine of the Reformed theologians is plain from their all
   teaching the doctrine of concursus, which Schweizer admits to be
   inconsistent with the assumption that God is the sole cause of all
   things. It was this false assumption that no creature can act; that
   dependence on God is absolute; and that all power however manifested is
   the power of God, which led to the doctrine of a continued creation, as
   stated when speaking of the efficiency of God in the preservation of
   the world. It led also to the doctrine of occasional causes; that is,
   to the theory that what we call second causes have no real efficiency,
   but are only the occasions on which God manifests his power in a
   particular way. The world of matter and mind exists indeed, but it is
   perfectly inert. It is only the instrument or means by which the
   manifold and everywhere present efficiency of God is manifested.
   "Consideremus," says Leibnitz, "eorum sententiam, qui rebus creatis
   veram, et propriam actionem adimunt, . . . . qui putant non res agere,
   sed Deum ad rerum præsentiam, et secundum rerum aptitudem; adeoque res
   occasiones esse, non causas, et recipere, non efficere aut elicere."
   [549] The same views of the dependence of creatures on God lies at the
   foundation of the whole system of Dr. Emmons. He held that if any
   creature were endowed with activity or power to act, it would be
   independent of God. "We cannot conceive," he says, "that even
   Omnipotence itself is able to form independent agents, because this
   would be to endow them with divinity. And since all men are dependent
   agents, all their motions, exercises, or actions must originate in a
   divine efficiency." This is not to be understood as simply asserting
   the necessity of a divine concursus in order to the operation of second
   causes, for Emmons expressly teaches that God creates all the volitions
   of the soul, and effects by his almighty power all changes in the
   material world.

   Objections to this Doctrine of Dependence.

   To this whole doctrine, which thus denies the existence of second
   causes, and refers all action both in the material and spiritual world
   to God, it is to be objected, (1.) That it is founded on an arbitrary
   assumption. It starts with the à priori idea of an absolute and
   infinite being, and rejects everything inconsistent with that idea. It
   cannot be proved that it is inconsistent with the nature of God that He
   should call into existence creatures capable of originating action. It
   is enough that such creatures should derive all their powers from God,
   and be subject to his control in all their exercises. (2.) This
   doctrine contradicts the consciousness of every man. We know, as
   certainly as we know anything, that we are free agents, and that free
   agency is the power of self-determination, or of originating our own
   acts. It contradicts not only our self-consciousness, but the laws of
   belief which God has impressed upon our nature. It is one of those laws
   that we should believe in the reality of the objects of our senses; and
   that belief involves the conviction not only that they really are, but
   also that they are the causes of the impressions which they make on our
   sensibility. It is to put philosophy in conflict with common sense, and
   with the universal convictions of men, to teach that all this is a
   delusion; that when we see a tree we are mistaken, that God immediately
   creates that impression in our mind; or that when we will to move the
   power is not in us, that it is not we that move, but God that moves us;
   or when we think, that it is God creates the thought. (3.) As has been
   before remarked, this system naturally leads, and has led to idealism
   and pantheism, and therefore is utterly inconsistent with all liberty
   and responsibility, and destroys the possibility of moral distinctions.

   C. The Doctrine that there is no Efficiency except in Mind.

   According to this view, there are no such things as physical forces.
   The mind of man is endowed with the power of producing effects; but
   apart from mind, divine or created, there is no efficiency in the
   universe. This doctrine finds its way into many theological, as well as
   philosophical disquisitions. Thus Principal Tulloch says, a cause is
   "coincident with an agent." It "therefore implies mind. More
   definitely, and in its full conception, it implies a rational will."
   [550] Physical causes are therefore regarded as the ever operating will
   of God. "The idea of causation," he says, "we found to resolve itself
   into that of the operation of a rational mind or will in nature." [551]
   Providence is nothing else than a "continued forth-putting of that
   [originally creative] efficiency." [552] Dr. Tulloch very correctly
   assumes that a cause is that which has power to produce effects; and
   that we get our idea of power, and therefore of the nature of
   causation, from our own consciousness of efficiency. He hence infers
   that, as mind is the only cause of which we have immediate knowledge,
   therefore it is the only one that exists. But this is a non-sequitur.
   That mind is a cause, is no proof that electricity may not be a cause.
   The facts, as understood by the mass of men are, First, we are
   conscious of efficiency, or the power to produce effects. Second, the
   exercise of this power awakens, or gives occasion to the intuition of
   the universal and necessary truth that every effect must have an
   appropriate cause. Thirdly, as we see around us effects of different
   kinds, it is a law of reason that they should be referred to causes of
   different kinds. The evidence that this is a law of reason, is the fact
   that men everywhere assume physical causes to account for physical
   effects, as uniformly as they assume mind for intelligent effects. The
   theory, however, which resolves all forces into the everywhere
   operative will of God has great attractions. It makes a way of escape
   from many of the difficulties which beset the question of God's
   relation to the world. Even men devoted to the study of nature get so
   puzzled by such questions, as, What is matter? or What is force? that
   they are disposed, in many cases, to merge all things into God. The
   Duke of Argyle says, "Science, in the modern doctrine of Conservation
   of Energy and the Convertibility of Forces, is already getting
   something like a firm hold of the idea that all kinds of Force are but
   forms or manifestations of some one Central Force issuing from some one
   Fountain-head of Power. Sir John Herschel has not hesitated to say,
   that it is but reasonable to regard the Force of Gravitation as the
   direct or indirect result of a consciousness or a will existing
   somewhere.' And even if we cannot certainly identify Force in all its
   forms with the direct energies of the One Omnipresent and all-pervading
   Will, it is at least in the highest degree unphilosophical to assume
   the contrary, -- to speak or to think as if the Forces of Nature were
   either independent of, or even separate from, the Creator's Power."
   [553]

   It was remarked on a previous page that Wallace still more decidedly
   adopts the same view. In his book on "Natural Selection," after he had
   defended Darwin's theory on the origin of species (except in its
   application to man), he comes in the end to start the question, What is
   matter? This question he answers by saying, "Matter is essentially
   force, and nothing but force. Matter, as popularly understood, does not
   exist, and is, in fact, philosophically inconceivable." [554] The next
   question is, What is force? The ultimate answer to this is, that it is
   the will of God. "If," says Mr. Wallace, "we have traced one force,
   however minute, to an origin in our own Will, while we have no
   knowledge of any other primary cause of force, it does not seem an
   improbable conclusion that all force may be will force; and thus the
   whole universe is not merely dependent on, but actually is, the Will of
   higher intelligences or of one Supreme Intelligence." [555]

   This theory is substantially the same as that previously mentioned.
   They differ only as to the extent of their application. According to
   the doctrine of "Absolute Dependence," God is the only agent in the
   universe; according to the doctrine just stated, He is the only agent,
   or his will is the only energy in the material world. Matter is
   nothing. "It does not exist." It is nothing but force, and force is
   God; therefore the external world is God, In other words, all the
   impressions and sensations made upon us, as we suppose, by things
   without us, are in fact made by the immediate power of God: there is no
   earth; there are no stars; no men or women; no fathers or mothers. Men
   cannot believe this. By the constitution of our nature, which no man
   can alter, we are forced to believe in the reality of the external
   world; that matter is, and that it is the proximate cause of the
   effects which we attribute to its agency.

   D. Theory of Preëstablished Harmony.

   Another assumption made by philosophers is, that one substance cannot
   act upon another substance of a different kind; what is extended cannot
   act upon what is not extended; matter cannot act on mind, nor mind on
   matter. It is, however, a fact of consciousness and of daily
   observation, that, apparently at least, material objects by which we
   are surrounded are the causes of certain sensations and perceptions,
   that is, they act upon our minds; and it is no less a matter of
   consciousness that our minds do act, at least so it seems, upon our
   bodies. We can move, we can control the action of all our voluntary
   muscles. This, however, must be a delusion if matter cannot act on mind
   nor mind on matter. To account for the relation in which mind and
   matter stand to each other in this world, and for the apparent action
   of the one on the other, Leibnitz adopted the theory of a
   preëstablished harmony. God created two independent worlds, the one of
   matter, the other of mind; each has its own nature and its own
   principle of activity. All the changes in matter, all the actions of
   our bodies, are determined from a source within the matter and within
   our bodies, and would occur in the same order in which they actually
   take place if no created mind were in existence. In like manner, all
   the varying states of the human mind, all its sensations, perceptions,
   and volitions are determined from within, and would be just what they
   are though the external world had no existence. We should see the same
   sights, hear the same sounds, have the same volitions to move this or
   that muscle, though there were nothing to see, hear or move. These two
   worlds, thus automatically moved, coexist, and are made to act in
   harmony by a prearrangement divinely ordered. Hence the sensation of
   burning arises in the mind, not because fire acts on the body and the
   body on the mind, but because, by this preëstablished harmony, these
   events are made to coincide in time and space. From eternity it was
   determined that I should have a volition to move my arm at a certain
   time; and from eternity it was determined that the arm should move at
   that time. The two events therefore concur as immediate antecedent and
   consequent, but the volition stands in no causal relation to the
   motion. The volition would have been formed had there been no arm to
   move; and the arm would have moved, although the volition had never
   been formed. Leibnitz's hand would have written all his wonderful
   books, mathematical and philosophical, and conducted all his
   controversies with Bayle, Clarke, and Newton, though his soul had never
   been created. [556]

   E. Doctrine of Concursus.

   A far more widely adopted and permanently influential principle is that
   no second cause can act until acted upon. Nothing created can originate
   action. This principle, carried to a greater or less extent, was
   adopted by Augustine, by the schoolmen, by the Thomists and Dominicans
   in the Latin Church, and by Protestants, whether Lutherans, Reformed,
   or Remonstrants. It was assumed as a philosophical axiom, to which all
   theological doctrines should be conformed. "Ad gubernationem concursus
   pertinet, quo Deus non solum dat vim agendi causis secundis et eam
   conservat, sed et easdem movet et applicat ad agendum. Præcursus etiam
   dicitur, nam causæ secundm non movent nisi motæ." [557] "Prima causa,"
   says Turrettin, "est primum movens in omni actione, ideo causa secunda
   non potest movere, nisi moveatur, nec agere, nisi acta a prima; alioqui
   erit principium sui motus, et sic non amplius esset causa secunda, sed
   prima." [558] In the production of every effect, therefore, there is
   the efficiency of two causes, the first and second. But this is not to
   be considered as involving two operations, as when two horses are
   attached to the same vehicle, which is drawn partly by the one and
   partly by the other. The efficiency of the first cause is in the
   second, and not merely with it. Deus "immediate influit in actionem et
   effectum creaturæ, ita ut idem effectus non a solo Deo, nec a sola
   creatura, nec partim a Deo, partim a creatura, sed una eademque
   efficientia totali simul a Deo et creatura producatur, a Deo videlicet
   ut causa universali et prima, a creatura ut particulari et secunda."
   [559] "Non est re ipsa alia actio influxus Dei, alia operatio creaturæ,
   sed una et indivsibilis actio, utrumque respiciens et ab utroque
   pendens, a Deo ut causa universali, a creatura ut particulari." [560]

   This concursus is represented, first, as general; an influence of the
   omnipresent power of God not only sustaining creatures and their
   properties and powers, but exciting each to act according to its
   nature. It is analogous to the general influence of the sun which
   affects different objects in different ways. The same solar ray softens
   wax and hardens clay. It calls the germinating force of all seeds into
   action, but does not determine the nature of that action. All seeds are
   thus quickened; but one develops as wheat, another as barley, not
   because of the solar force, but because of its own peculiar nature.
   This is all that the Franciscans and Jesuits among the Romanists, and
   the Remonstrants among the Protestants allow. The Thomists and
   Dominicans among the former, and the Augustinian theologians generally,
   insist that, besides this general concursus, there is also a previous,
   simultaneous, and determining concourse of the first, in all second
   causes, both in the cause and in the effect; that is, not only exciting
   to action, but sustaining, guiding, and determining the act; so that
   its being as it is, and not otherwise, is to be referred to the first,
   and not to the second cause in every case. On this point, however, the
   Reformed theologians are not agreed, as Turrettin admits. "Ex nostris,"
   he says, "quidam concursum tantum prævium volunt quoad bona opera
   gratiæ, sed in aliis omnibus simultaneum sufficere existimant." [561]
   By previous concursus is meant, he says, "Actio Dei, qua in causas
   earumque principia influendo, creaturas excitat, et agendum præmovet,
   et ad hoc potius quam ad illud agendum applicat. Simultaneus vero est
   per quam Deus actionem creaturæ, quoad suam entitatem, vel substantiam
   producit; quo una cum creaturis in earum actiones et effectus influere
   ponitur, non vero in creaturas ipsas." [562] It is admitted that these
   do not differ really, "quia concursus simultaneus, nihil aliud est,
   quam concursus prævius continuatus." This previous concursus is also
   called predetermining. "Id ipsum etiam nomine Prædeterminationis, seu
   Præmotionis solet designari, qua Deus ciet et applicat causam secundam
   ad agendum, adeoque antecedenter ad omnem operationem creaturæ, seu
   prius natura et ratione quam creatura operetur, eam realiter et
   efficaciter movet ad agendum in singulis actionibus, adeo ut sine hac
   præmotione causa secunda operari non possit, ea vero posita impossibile
   sit in sensu composito causam secundam non illud idem agere ad quod a
   prima causa præmovetur." [563]

   Concursus, therefore, assumes, (1.) That God gives to second causes the
   power of acting. (2.) That He preserves them in being and vigour. (3.)
   That He excites and determines second causes to act. (4.) That He
   directs and governs them to the predetermined end. All this, however,
   was so understood that --

   1. The effect produced or the act performed is to be referred to the
   second, and not to the first cause. When the fire burns, it is to the
   fire, and not to God that the effect is to be attributed. When a man
   speaks, it is the man, and not God who utters the words. When the moon
   raises the tidal wave, and the wave dashes a vessel on the shore, the
   effect is to be attributed, not to the moon, but to the momentum of the
   wave. The force of gravity acts uniformly on all ponderable matter, and
   yet that force may be indefinitely varied in the effects which are
   produced by intervening causes, whether necessary or free.

   2. The doctrine of concursus does not deny the efficiency of second
   causes. They are real causes, having a principium agendi in themselves.

   3. The agency of God neither supersedes, nor in any way interferes with
   the efficiency of second causes. "Ad providentiam divinam non pertinet,
   naturam rerum corrumpere, sed servare: unde omnia movet secundum eorum
   conditionem: ita quod ex causis necessariis per motionem divinam
   consequuntur effectus ex necessitate; ex causis autem contingentibus
   sequuntur effectus contingentes. Quia igitur voluntas est activum
   principium non determinatum ad unum, sed indifferenter se habens ad
   multa, sic Deus ipsam movet, quod non ex necessitate ad unum
   determinat, sed remanet motus ejus contingens et non necessarius, nisi
   in his ad quæ naturaliter movetur." [564] "Concurrit Deus cum
   naturalibus ad modum causæ naturalis, cum causis liberis per modum
   causæ liberæ." [565] "Duo sunt causarum genera, aliæ definitæ et
   generales, quæ eodem modo semper agunt, ut ignis qui urit, sol qui
   lucet; aliæ indefinitæ et liberæ, quæ possunt agere vel non agere, hoc
   vel illo modo agere: ita Deus naturam earum conservat, et cum illis
   juxta eam in agendo concurrit; cum definitis, ut ipse eas determinet
   sine determinatione propria; cum indefinitis vero et liberis, ut ipsæ
   quoque se determinent proprio rationis judicio, et libera voluntatis
   dispositione, quam Deus non aufert homini, quia sic opus suum
   destrueret, sed relinquit et confirmat." [566] To the same effect the
   "Westminster Confession" [567] says: God ordereth events "to fall out
   according to the nature of second causes, either necessarily, freely,
   or contingently."

   4. From this it follows that the efficiency or agency of God is not the
   same in relation to all kinds of events. It is one thing in coöperating
   with material causes, another in coöperating with free agents. It is
   one thing in relation to good acts, and another in relation to evil
   actions; one thing in nature, and another in grace.

   5. The divine concursus is not inconsistent with the liberty of free
   agents. "Moveri voluntarie est moveri ex se, id est, a principio
   intrinseco. Sed illud principium intrinsecum potest esse ab alio
   principio extrinseco. Et sic moveri ex se, non repugnat ei, quod
   movetur ab alio. -- Illud quod movetur ab altero, dicitur cogi, si
   moveatur contra inclinationem propriam: sed si moveatur ab alio quod
   sibi dat propriam inclinationem, non dicitur cogi. Sic igitur Deus
   movendo voluntatem, non cogit ipsam: quia dat ei ejus propriam
   inclinationem." [568] This is undoubtedly true. Nothing is more certain
   from Scripture than that God is the author of faith and repentance.
   They are his gifts. They are blessings for which we pray, and which He
   promises. Yet nothing is more certain from consciousness, than that
   faith and repentance are our own free acts. Therefore moveri ab alio is
   not inconsistent with moveri ex se. On this point Turrettin [569] says:
   "Cum providentia non concurrat cum voluntate humana, vel per
   coactionem, cogendo voluntatem invitam, vel determinando physice, ut
   rem brutan et cæcam absque ullo judicio, sed rationaliter, flectendo
   voluntatem modo ipsi convenienti, ut seipsam determinet, ut causa
   proxima actionum suarum proprio rationis judicio, et spontanea
   voluntatis electione; eam libertati nostræ nullam vim inferre, sed
   illam potius amice fovere."

   6. All the advocates of the doctrine of concursus admit that the great
   difficulty attending it is in reference to sin. The difficulty here is
   not so much in relation to the responsibility of the sinner. If sin be
   his own act, and if the divine concursus does not interfere with his
   freedom, it does not interfere with his responsibility. When God by his
   grace determines the will of his people to holy acts, the holiness is
   theirs. It constitutes their character. When God gives a man beauty, he
   is beautiful. And if his coöperation in the sins of men leaves their
   freedom in sinning unimpaired, they are as truly sinful as though no
   such coöperation existed. This is not the difficulty. The real question
   is, how can God's coöperation in sin be reconciled with his own
   holiness? We can easily see how God can coöperate in good acts, and
   rejoice in the goodness which is his gift; but how can He so concur in
   sinful acts as not only to preserve the sinner in the exercise of his
   ability to act, but also to excite to action, and determine his act to
   be what it is, and not otherwise? This difficulty was, as has been
   remarked, freely acknowledged. It was met by defining sin as mere
   defect. It is a want of conformity to the moral law. As such it
   requires not an efficient, but only a deficient cause. God is the
   source immediately or remotely of all efficiency, but is not the source
   of mere deficiency. In every sinful act, therefore, there was
   distinguished the act as an act requiring an efficient cause; and the
   moral quality of that act, or its want of conformity to law, a mere
   relation, which is not an ens, and therefore is in no way to be
   referred to God. This is the answer to this objection given by
   Augustine, and repeated from his day to this. Aquinas [570] says:
   "Quicquid est entitatis et actionis in actione mala, reducitur in Deum
   sicut in causam: sed quod est ibi defectus non causatur a Deo, sed ex
   causa secunda deficiente." Quenstedt [571] says: "Distinguendum inter
   effectum et defectum, inter actionem et actionis ataxian. Effectus et
   actio est a Deo, non vero defectus et ataxia sive inordinatio et
   exorbitatio actionis. Ad effectum Deus concurrit, vitium non causat,
   non enim in agendo deficit aut errat, sed causa secunda." Bucan [572]
   says: "Malorum opera quoque decernit et regit. Tamen non est autor
   mali, quia mali sic aguntur a Deo, ut sponte, libere et sine coactione
   et impulsu violento agant. Deinde non infundit malitiam sicut
   bonitatem, nec impellit aut allicit ad peccandum." To the same effect
   Turrettin [573] says: "Cum actus qua talis semper bonus sit quoad
   entitatem suam, Deus ad illum concurrit effective, et physice. . . . .
   (quoad malitiam) Deus nec causa physica potest ejus dici, quia nec
   illam inspirat aut infundit, nec facit; nec ethica, qui nec imperat,
   aut approbat et suadet, sed severissime prohibet et punit." As the same
   solar influence quickens into life all kinds of plants, whether
   nutritious or poisonous; as the same current of water may be guided in
   one channel or another; as the same vital force animates the limbs of
   the sound man and of the cripple; as the same hand may sweep the keys
   of an instrument when in tune and when out of tune: so it is urged that
   the same divine efficiency sustains and animates all free agents. That
   they act at all is due to the divine efficiency, but the particular
   nature of their acts (at least when evil) is to be referred, not to
   that all-pervading efficiency of God, but to the nature or character of
   each particular agent. That God controls and governs wicked men,
   determines their wickedness to take one form, and not another, and
   guides it to manifestations which will promote good rather than evil,
   is not inconsistent with the holiness of God. He did not infuse envy
   and hatred into the hearts of Joseph's brethren, but He guided the
   exercise of those evil passions, so as to secure the preservation of
   Jacob and the chosen seed from destruction.

   Remarks on the Doctrine of Concursus.

   The above statement of the doctrine of concursus is designed merely to
   give the views generally entertained by Augustinians, as to the nature
   of God's providential government. Whether those views are correct or
   not, it is important that they should be understood. It is very evident
   that there is a broad distinction between this theory of concursus and
   the theory which resolves all events, whether necessary or free, into
   the immediate agency of God. The points of difference between the two
   theories are, (1.) That the one admits and the other denies the reality
   and efficiency of second causes. (2.) The one makes no distinction
   between free and necessary events, attributing them equally to the
   almighty and creative energy of God; the other admits the validity and
   unspeakable importance of this distinction. (3.) The one asserts and
   the other denies that the agency of God is the same in sinful acts that
   it is in good acts. (4.) The one admits that God is the author of sin,
   the other repudiates that doctrine with abhorrence. The Reformed
   theologians protested against the aspersion freely made by Romanists,
   and afterwards by the Remonstrants, that the Augustinian doctrine led
   by any fair process of reasoning to the conclusion that God is the
   cause of sin. They quote from their opponents admissions which involve
   all that they themselves teach in reference to the agency of God in the
   wicked acts of men. Thus Bellarmin, who freely brings this objection
   against the Protestants, himself says, [574] "Deus non solum permittit
   impios agere multa mala, nec solum deserit pios ut cogantur pati quæ ab
   impiis inferuntur; sed etiam præsidet ipsis voluntatibus malis, easque
   regit et gubernat, torquet ac flectit in eis invisibiliter operando, ut
   licet vitio proprio malæ sint, tamen a divina providentia ad unum
   potius malum, quam ad aliud, non positive sed permissive ordinentur."
   As to this passage, Turrettin says, "Quibus verbis nihil durius apud
   nostros occurrit." Bellarmin also quotes [575] and adopts the language
   of Aquinas when he says, "Deum non solum inclinare voluntates malas ad
   unum potius, quam ad aliud permittendo, ut ferantur in unum, et non
   permittendo, ut ferantur in aliud, ut Hugo recte docuit, sed etiam
   positive inclinando in unum et avertendo ab alio." It is of importance,
   not only as a matter of historical truth, but also for its moral
   influence, that the fact should be distinctly known and recognized that
   the Reformed theologians, with all Augustinians before and after the
   Reformation, earnestly rejected the doctrine that God is the author or
   the efficient cause of sin.

   The objection to the doctrine of concursus is not that it intentionally
   or really destroys the free agency of man; or that it makes God the
   author of sin, but (1.) That it is founded on an arbitrary and false
   assumption. It denies that any creature can originate action. This does
   not admit of proof. It is an inference from the assumed nature of the
   dependence of the creature upon the creator; or from the assumed
   necessity of the principle in question, in order to secure the absolute
   control of God over created beings. It however contradicts the
   consciousness of men. That we are free agents means that we have the
   power to act freely; and to act freely implies that we originate our
   own acts. This does not mean that it is inconsistent with our liberty
   that we should be moved and induced to exert our ability to act by
   considerations addressed to our reason or inclinations, or by the grace
   of God; but it does mean that we have the power to act. The power of
   spontaneous action is essential to the nature of a spirit and God, in
   creating us in his own nature as spirits, endowed us with the power to
   originate our own acts. (2.) A second objection to the doctrine is that
   it is an attempt to explain the inexplicable. Not content with the
   simple and certain declaration of the Bible, that God does govern all
   his creatures and all their actions, it undertakes to explain how this
   is done. From the nature of the case this is impossible. We see that
   material causes act, but we cannot tell how they act. We are conscious
   of the power to guide our own thoughts, and to determine our own wills;
   but how it is we exercise this efficiency, passes our comprehension. We
   know that the will has power over certain muscles of the body; but the
   point of connection, the nexus between volition and muscular action, is
   altogether inscrutable. Why then should we attempt to explain how it is
   that the efficiency of God controls the efficiency of second causes?
   The fact is plain, and the fact alone is important; but the mode of
   Gods action we cannot possibly understand. (3.) A third objection is
   that this doctrine multiplies difficulties. By attempting to teach how
   God governs free agents, that He first excites them to act; sustains
   them in action; determines them to act so, and not otherwise; that He
   effectually concurs in the entity, but not necessarily in the moral
   quality of the act, we raise at every step the most subtle and
   perplexing metaphysical questions, which no man is able to solve. And
   even admitting the theory of concursus, as expounded by the schoolmen
   and scholastic theologians, to be true, what does it amount to? What
   real knowledge does it communicate? All we know, and all we need to
   know, is, (1.) That God does govern all his creatures; and (2.) That
   his control over them is consistent with their nature, and with his own
   infinite purity and excellence.

   As this doctrine of Providence involves the question of Gods relation
   to the world, it is confessedly the most comprehensive and difficult in
   the compass either of theology or of philosophy. As the world, meaning
   thereby the universe of created beings, includes the world of matter
   and the world of mind, the doctrine of providence concerns, first, the
   relation of God to the external or material universe; and secondly, his
   relation to the world of mind, or to his rational creatures.

   § 4. Principles involved in the Scriptural Doctrine of Providence.

   A. The Providence of God over the Material Universe.

   So far as concerns the relation of God to the external world, the
   following facts appear to be either assumed, or clearly taught in the
   Bible.

   1. There is an external world, or material universe. What we call the
   world is not a phantom, a delusive show. It is not ourselves, our own
   varying states, however produced. But matter is a real existence. It is
   a substance; that which is, and continues, and has identity in all its
   varying states. This is of course opposed to pantheism, which makes the
   external world an existence form of God; to idealism; and to the
   dynamic theory which teaches that matter is merely force. This latter
   doctrine is intelligible, if by force be understood the constantly
   acting will of God, for that is the energy of the divine substance. But
   in the way in which the doctrine is commonly presented, force is taken
   as the ultimate fact. Matter is force, it is not a substance, but
   simply activity, power. But it is self-evident that nothing cannot act,
   or cannot produce motion, which force does. It is just as plain that
   there cannot be action without something acting, as that there cannot
   be motion without something moving, as has been so often said. Force,
   therefore, does not exist of itself. It of necessity implies a
   substance of which it is an affection, or manifestation, or property.
   The real existence of the external world is one of those common sense
   and Scriptural facts, vouched for by the very constitution of our
   nature, and which it is utterly useless to deny.

   Matter is Active.

   2. The second fact or principle recognized by Scripture, is that matter
   is active. It has properties or forces, which are the proximate causes
   of the physical changes which we constantly see and experience. This is
   considered by scientific men almost an axiomatic truth. "No force
   without matter, and no matter without force." This is also the general
   conviction of men. When they take a heavy body in their hand, they
   attribute its weight to the nature of the body and its relation to the
   earth. When one substance produces the sensation of sweetness, and
   another the sensation of acidity, they instinctively refer the
   difference to the substances themselves. So of all other physical
   effects; they are always and everywhere referred to physical causes.
   Such is a law of our nature; and therefore the theory which denies that
   any physical causes exist, and refers all natural effects or changes to
   the immediate operation of the divine will, contradicts our nature, and
   cannot be true. Besides, as we have already seen, that theory logically
   leads to idealism and pantheism. It merges the universe into God.

   These physical forces act of necessity, blindly, and uniformly. They
   are everywhere and always the same. The law of gravitation is in the
   remotest regions of space what it is here on our earth. It acts always,
   and always in the same way. The same is true of all other physical
   forces. Light, heat, electricity, and chemical affinities are
   everywhere the same in their mode of operations.

   Laws of Nature.

   The ambiguity of the words, law and nature, has already been remarked
   upon. The phrase "Laws of Nature" is, however, generally used in one or
   the other of two senses. It either means an observed regular sequence
   of events, without any reference to the cause by which that regularity
   of sequence is determined; or it means a uniformly acting force in
   nature. In this last sense we speak of the laws of gravitation, light,
   heat, electricity, etc. That there are such laws, or such physical
   forces, acting uniformly, which are not to be resolved into "uniform
   modes of divine operation," is, as we have seen, an important
   Scriptural fact.

   The chief question is, In what relation does God stand to these laws?
   The answer to that question, as drawn from the Bible, is, First, that
   He is their author. He endowed matter with these forces, and ordained
   that they should be uniform. Secondly, He is independent of them. He
   can change, annihilate, or suspend them at pleasure. He can operate
   with them or without them. "The Reign of Law" must not be made to
   extend over Him who made the laws. Thirdly, As the stability of the
   universe, and the welfare, and even the existence of organized
   creatures, depend on the uniformity of the laws of nature, God never
   does disregard them except for the accomplishment of some high purpose.
   He, in the ordinary operations of his Providence, operates with and
   through the laws which He has ordained. He governs the material, as
   well as the moral world by law.

   The relation, therefore, in which God stands to the laws of nature, is,
   in one important aspect, analogous to that in which we ourselves stand
   to them. We employ them. Man can do nothing outside of himself without
   them; yet what marvels of ingenuity, beauty, and utility, has he not
   accomplished. Dr. Beale, as we have seen, illustrates God's relation to
   physical forces by a reference to a chemist in his laboratory. The
   chemicals do not put themselves in the retorts in due proportions, and
   subject themselves first to one and then to another operation. As mere
   blind, physical forces, they can accomplish nothing; at least nothing
   implying purpose or design. The chemical properties of the materials
   employed have their functions, and the chemist has his, evidently not
   only different, but diverse; i.e., of a different kind. Professor
   Henry's illustration was drawn from the relation of the engineer to the
   engine. The complicated structure of the machine, the composition and
   combustion of the fuel; the evaporation of the water, are all external
   to the engineer, and he to them. The locomotive, although instinct with
   power, stands perfectly still. At a touch of the engineer it starts
   into life, and yet with all its tremendous energy is perfectly obedient
   to his will.

   These, and any possible illustration, are of necessity very inadequate.
   The powers of nature of which man avails himself, are not dependent on
   him, and are only to a very limited extent under his control. He is
   entirely external to his works. God, however, fills heaven and earth.
   He is immanent in the world; intimately and always present with every
   particle of matter. And this presence is not of being only, but also of
   knowledge and power. It is manifestly inconsistent with the idea of an
   infinite God, that any part of his works should be absent from Him, out
   of his view, or independent of his control. Though everywhere thus
   efficiently present, his efficiency does not supersede that of his
   creatures. It is by a natural law, or physical force, that vapour
   arises from the surface of the ocean, is formed into clouds, and
   condenses and falls in show are upon the earth, yet God so controls the
   operation of the laws producing these effects, that He sends rain when
   and where He pleases. The same is true of all the operations of nature,
   and of all events in the external world. They are due to the efficiency
   of physical forces; but those forces, which are combined, adjusted, and
   made to coöperate or to counteract each other, in the greatest
   complexity, are all under the constant guidance of God, and are made to
   accomplish his purpose. It is perfectly rational, therefore, in a world
   where blind, natural forces are the proximate cause of everything that
   occurs, to pray for health, for protection, for success, for fruitful
   seasons, and for the peace and prosperity of nations, since all these
   events are determined by the intelligent agency of God.

   The providence of God is thus seen to be universal and extending to all
   his creatures and all their actions. The distinction usually and
   properly made between the general, special, and extraordinary
   providence of God, has reference to the effects produced, and not to
   his agency in their production; for this is the same in all cases. But
   if the object to be accomplished be a general one, such as the orderly
   motion of the heavenly bodies, or the support and regular operation of
   the laws of nature, then the providence of God is spoken of as general.
   Many men are willing to admit of this general superintendence of the
   world on the part of God, who deny his intervention in the production
   of definite effects. The Bible, however, clearly teaches, and all men
   instinctively believe in a special providence. That is, that God uses
   his control over the laws of nature, to bring about special effects.
   Men in sickness, in danger, or in any distress, pray to God for help.
   This is not irrational. It supposes God's relation to the world to be
   precisely what it is declared to be in the Bible. It does not suppose
   that God sets aside or counteracts the laws of nature; but simply that
   He controls them and causes them to produce whatever effects He sees
   fit. The Scriptures and the history of the world, and almost every
   man's experience, bear abundant evidence to such divine interpositions.
   We should be as helpless orphans were it not for this constant
   oversight and protection of our heavenly Father. Sometimes the
   circumstances attending these divine interventions are so unusual, and
   the evidences which they afford of divine control are so clear, that
   men cannot refuse to recognize the hand of God. There is, however,
   nothing extraordinary in the agency of God. It is only that we witness
   on these occasions more impressive manifestations of the absolute
   control, which He constantly exercises over the laws which He has
   ordained.

   The Uniformity of the Laws of Nature consistent with the Doctrine of
   Providence.

   It is obvious that the Scriptural doctrine of providence is not
   inconsistent with the "Reign of Law" in any proper sense of the words.
   The Scriptures recognize the fact that the laws of nature are
   immutable; that they are the ordinances of God; that they are uniform
   in their operation; and that they cannot be disregarded with impunity.
   But as man within his sphere can use these fixed laws to accomplish the
   most diversified purposes, so God in his unlimited sphere has them
   always and everywhere under his absolute control, so that, without
   suspending or violating them, they are ever subservient to his will.
   Certain philosophers do not admit this. To them the control of mind and
   the reign of law are incompatible; one or the other must be denied.
   "The fundamental character of all theological philosophy," says Lewes,
   "is the conceiving of phenomena as subjected to supernatural volition,
   and consequently as eminently and irregularly variable. Now, these
   theological conceptions can only be subverted finally by means of these
   two general processes, whose popular success is infallible in the long
   run. (1.) The exact and rational prevision of phenomena, and (2.) The
   possibility of modifying them, so as to promote our own ends and
   advantages. The former immediately dispels all idea of any directing
   volition;' and the latter leads to the same result, under another point
   of view, by making us regard this power as subordinated to our own."
   [576] If the fact that men can use the laws of nature to their "own
   ends and advantages" is compatible with the uniformity of those laws,
   the control of God over them for the accomplishment of his purposes
   cannot be inconsistent with their stability as laws. God rules the
   creation in accordance with the laws which He himself has ordained.

   God's Providence in Relation to Vital Processes.

   Life has ever been regarded as one of the most inscrutable of
   mysteries. However hard it may be to answer the question, What is life?
   or however diverse and unsatisfactory may be the answers given to that
   question, or the explanations proposed of its phenomena, there is
   little difference as to the facts of the case. (1.) It is admitted that
   there is a great difference between life and death -- between the
   living and the dead. No one who has ever looked upon a dead body has
   failed to be impressed with the fearful change involved in passing from
   life to death. (2.) It is very evident that the difference does not
   consist in anything which can be weighed or measured, or detected by
   the microscope or by chemical analysis. (3.) Certain processes go on
   where life is present, and are never seen when it is absent. These
   processes are organization, growth, and reproduction. (4.) These
   processes imply the perception of an end; a purpose or will to secure
   that end; and the intelligent choice and application of means for its
   attainment. This is the work of mind. If blind physical force can
   fashion the eye or the ear, and build up the whole animal body, with
   all its wonderful interdependencies and relations of parts and organs,
   and its designed adaptations for what is external and future, then
   there is no evidence of mind in heaven or earth; then all the works of
   art and of genius with which the world is crowded, may be the
   productions of dead matter, or of physical forces.

   But if life be mind, or, rather, if vital force be mental force, as
   indicated by the mode in which it acts, where does that mind reside? In
   the infinitesimally small germ of the plant or animal? or in something
   exterior to that germ? These are questions which have ever been
   demanding an answer, and to which different replies have been made.
   First, some say that nature itself is intelligent. By nature they do
   not mean the material world, but the vis in rebus insita. The forces
   which are active in the world, are conceived of as belonging to a
   substance or animating principle, or anima mundi. Some who believe in
   an extramundane personal God, believe that He has created and rendered
   immanent in the world this natura naturans, which they hold to be the
   seat of all the intelligence manifested in the works of nature. This is
   the only God some scientific men are willing to admit. Material nature,
   it is said, gives no evidence of the existence of a personal Being. We
   see in nature a mind, a universal mind, but still a mind which only
   operates and expresses itself by law. "Nature only does and only can
   inform us of mind in nature, the partner and correlative of organized
   matter." [577] Baden Powell, in his "Order of Nature," says, that the
   elevated views of a Deity as a personal God, and Omnipotent Creator,
   etc., are conceptions which "can originate only from some other source
   than physical philosophy." [578]

   Secondly, some assume that there is in the germ of every plant or
   animal what Agassiz calls "an immaterial principle," to which its
   organizing power is to be referred. Some connect this with the Platonic
   doctrine of ideas, as spiritual entities, which are the life and
   reality of all material organisms.

   Thirdly, others refer the intelligence manifested in vital processes to
   God; not immediately, but remotely. Men can construct machines to do
   intellectual work, without the machines themselves being intelligent.
   We have orreries, and calculating and typesetting machines, which,
   apparently at least, do the work of mind. If man can make a watch or
   locomotive engine, why may not God make watches and engines with the
   power of reproduction? The analogy, however, between the products of
   human ingenuity and living organism is imperfect. No product of human
   art can think or choose. A type-setting machine may be made, when the
   proper key is touched, to move an arm in the right direction and to the
   proper distance to reach the required letter; but it cannot be made of
   itself to select from a confused mass of type the letters one after
   another, and arrange them so as to form words and sentences. In other
   words, matter cannot be made to do the work of mind. It is admitted
   that everything is possible with God, but the contradictory is not an
   object of power. It is a contradiction that the extended should be
   unextended, that the irrational should be rational. It is, therefore,
   inconceivable that matter with its blind physical forces should perform
   the mental work exhibited in the processes of organization and growth.

   Fourthly, the intelligence required to account for the processes of
   vegetable and animal life is assumed to be in the everywhere present
   and everywhere active mind of God himself. This does not imply that
   physical or second causes have no efficiency, or that those causes are
   merged into the efficiency of God. It simply means that God uses the
   chemical, electric, photic, and other forces of nature, in carrying on
   organization and other vital processes in the vegetable and animal
   worlds. In such processes there is a combination of two specifically
   different forces; physical and mental. The physical are in the matter
   used; the mental in God who uses the matter and its forces. Examples of
   this combination of mental and physical force are familiar. All
   voluntary motion, on the part of animals, all the works of men, are due
   to such combination. Walking, speaking, and writing, are possible only
   so far as mind controls our material organization. In writing, for
   example, the vital functions are going on in the hand, on which its
   mobility and susceptibility of nervous impression depend; and the
   numerous voluntary muscles are called into action; but the guiding
   power is in the mind. It is the mind that determines what letters and
   sentences the fingers shall form, and what ideas shall be expressed. In
   like manner, it is the ever-present mind of God that guides the action
   of physical causes in the processes of animal and vegetable life. And
   as it would be unreasonable to refer to the physical forces called into
   activity, when we speak or write, the intelligence indicated in what is
   uttered or written, so it is unreasonable to refer to the forces of
   matter the intelligence indicated in the processes of life.

   It is because we cannot raise our minds to any proper apprehension of
   the infinity of God, that we find it so difficult to think of Him as
   thus everywhere present and everywhere intelligently active. This,
   however, ceases to be incredible, when we think of the marvellous
   coöperation of the mind and body which takes place in rapid talking,
   or, more wonderfully still, in a child before a piano, taking in at a
   glance the whole score, noticing the power and position of every note,
   striking eight keys of the instrument at the same time, and moving
   fifty or sixty voluntary muscles with the rapidity of lightning, and
   each at the right time, and with the right force. If the mere spark of
   intelligence in a child can do such wonders, why should it be thought
   incredible that the Infinite Mind should pervade and govern the
   universe?

   In support of the view here given, that the intelligence displayed in
   all vital processes is the intelligence of the everywhere present and
   everywhere active mind of God, it may be urged, in the first place,
   that the principle involved in this doctrine is assumed in time
   simplest truths of natural religion. If God be not thus everywhere
   present, and everywhere active in the control of secondary causes,
   there is no propriety or use in prayer, and no ground of confidence in
   divine protection. In the second place, it seems to be the only way to
   account for the facts of the case. That the processes of life in
   vegetables and animals do manifest intelligence cannot be denied. They
   manifest foresight, purpose, choice, and controlling power. This
   intelligence cannot be referred to matter, or to physical forces. The
   most advanced scientific Materialism does not make mind an attribute,
   or function, or product of all matter, but only of the highly organized
   matter of the brain. But there is no brain in the vegetable or animal
   germ. Brain is as much a product of life (and therefore of mind) as
   sinew or bone.

   In the third place, the authority of Scripture may be claimed in
   support of the doctrine in question. The Bible teaches the omnipresence
   of God; i.e., the omnipresence of mind. The phrase "God fills heaven
   and earth," means that mind pervades heaven and earth, that there is no
   portion of space in which mind is not present and active. The
   Scriptures also teach that all things, even the most minute, as the
   number of the hairs of our head, the falling of a sparrow, the flight
   of an arrow, are all under the control of God. He also is said to cause
   the grass to grow, which means not only that He so orders physical
   causes that vegetation is the result, but also, as appears from other
   representations, that the organization and growth of the plant are
   determined by his agency. This seems to be clearly taught with regard
   to the bodies of men in Psalm cxxxix. 15, 16, "My substance was not hid
   from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the
   lowest parts of the earth. Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being
   unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in
   continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them."
   However doubtful may be the interpretation of the 16th verse in the
   original, the general meaning of the passage cannot be mistaken. It
   clearly teaches that the human body is fashioned in the womb by the
   intelligence of God, and not by undirected physical causes, acting
   blindly.

   B. The Providence of God over Rational Creatures.

   God's providence, however, extends over the world of mind, i.e., over
   rational free agents, as well as over the material universe. The
   principles involved in the Scriptural doctrine concerning God's
   providential government of rational creatures are, --

   1. That mind is essentially active. It originates its own acts. This is
   a matter of consciousness. It is essential to liberty and
   responsibility. It is clearly the doctrine of the Bible which call on
   men to act, and regards them as the authors of their own acts. This
   principle, as we have seen, stands opposed, (a.) To the doctrine of a
   continued creation. (b.) To the doctrine which denies the efficiency of
   second causes and merges all power into the immediate power of God; and
   (c.) To the doctrine that free agents are so dependent that they cannot
   act unless acted upon, or move unless they are moved ab extra.

   2. But although free agents have the power to act, and originate their
   own acts, they are not only upheld in being and efficiency by the power
   of God, but He controls the use which they make of their ability. (a.)
   He can, and often does, hinder their action. (b.) He determines their
   action to be in one way and not in another; so that it is rational to
   pray that God would incline the hearts of men to show us favour; that
   He would change the dispositions and purposes of wicked men; and that
   He would work in us to will as well as to do. No creature, therefore,
   is independent of God in the exercise of the powers with which He has
   endowed it. The hearts of men are in his hands, and He controls their
   action as effectually as He controls the operations of nature. But his
   agency in the world of spirits no more interferes with the laws of
   mind, than his agency in the external world interferes with the
   efficiency of material causes.

   Distinction between the Providential Efficiency of God, and the
   Influences of the Holy Spirit.

   3. The providential agency of God in the government of free agents is
   not to be confounded with the operations of his grace. These two things
   are constantly represented in the Bible as distinct. The one is
   natural, the other supernatural. In the one God acts according to
   uniform laws, or by his potentia ordinata, in the other, according to
   the good pleasure of his will, or by his potentia absoluta. The control
   which God exercises over the ordinary acts of men, and especially over
   the wicked, is analogous to that which He exercises in the guidance of
   material causes. whereas his agency in the operations of his grace is
   more analogous to his mode of action in prophecy, inspiration, and
   miracles. In the former, or in his providential agency over minds,
   nothing is effected which transcends the efficiency of second causes.
   In the latter the effects are such as second causes are utterly
   inadequate to accomplish. The most obvious points of difference between
   the two cases are, (1.) In the ordinary operations or acts of free
   agents, the ability to perform them belongs to the agent and arises out
   of his nature as a rational creature, and is inseparable from it;
   whereas the acts of faith, repentance, and other holy affections do not
   flow from the ability of men in the present condition of their nature,
   but from a new principle of life supernaturally communicated and
   maintained. (2.) The ordinary acts of men, and especially their wicked
   acts, are determined by their own natural inclinations and feelings.
   God does not awaken, or infuse those feelings or dispositions in order
   to determine sinners to act wickedly. On the other hand, all gracious
   or holy affections are thus infused or excited by the Spirit of God.
   (3.) The providential government of God over free agents is exercised
   as much in accordance with the laws of mind, as his providential
   government over the material world is in accordance with the
   established laws of matter. Both belong to the potentia ordinata, or
   ordered efficiency of God. This is not the case in the operations of
   his grace. Holy affections and exercises are not due to the mere moral
   power of the truth, or its control over our natural affections, but to
   the indwelling of the Spirit of God. So that it is not we that live,
   but Christ that liveth in us. It is indeed our life, but it is a life
   divine in its origin, and sustained and guided in all its exercises by
   a higher influence than the laws of mind, or an influence which
   operates merely through them, and according to their natural
   operations. This distinction between nature and grace, between the
   providential efficiency of God and the workings of his Spirit in the
   hearts of his people is one of the most important in all theology. It
   makes all the difference between Augustinianism and Pelagianism,
   between Rationalism and supernatural, evangelical religion.

   Conclusion.

   Such are the general principles involved in this most difficult
   doctrine of Divine Providence. We should be equally on our guard
   against the extreme which merges all efficiency in God, and which, in
   denying all second causes, destroys human liberty and responsibility,
   and makes God not only the author of sin, but in reality the only Being
   in the universe; and the opposite extreme which banishes God from the
   world which He has made, and which, by denying that He governs all his
   creatures and all their actions, destroys the foundation of all
   religion, and dries up the fountains of piety. If this latter view be
   correct, there is no God to whom we can look for the supply of our
   wants, or for protection from evil; whose favour we can seek, or whose
   displeasure we need dread. We, and all things else, are in the hands of
   blindly operating causes. Between these equally fatal extremes lies the
   Scriptural doctrine that God governs all his creatures and all their
   actions. This doctrine admits the reality and efficiency of second
   causes, both material and mental, but denies that they are independent
   of the Creator and Preserver of the universe. It teaches that an
   infinitely wise, good, and powerful God is everywhere present,
   controlling all events great and small, necessary and free, in a way
   perfectly consistent with the nature of his creatures and with his own
   infinite excellence, so that everything is ordered by his will and is
   made to subserve his wise and benevolent designs.

CHAPTER XII.

  MIRACLES.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Their Nature. Meaning and Usage of the Word.

   The word miracle is derived from miror, to wonder, and the refore
   signifies that which excites wonder. In this etymological sense of the
   word it may be used to designate any extraordinary event adapted to
   excite surprise and rouse attention. The words used in the Bible in
   reference to miraculous events do not inform us of their nature. The
   most common of these are, (1.) phl', something separated, or singular.
   (2.) 'vt,signum, portentum, something designed to confirm. (3.) mvpht
   (of uncertain derivation), used in the sense of tupos, of persons and
   things held up as a warning, and for remarkable events confirming the
   authority of prophets. (4.) gvvrh, power, used for any extraordinary
   manifestation of divine power. (5.) "Works of the Lord." In most cases
   these terms express the design, rather than the nature of the events to
   which they are applied.

   Such being the indefinite meaning of these Scriptural terms, it is not
   surprising that the word miracle was used in the Church in a very loose
   sense. Anything wonderful, anything for which the proximate cause could
   not be discovered, and anything in which divine agency was specially
   indicated was called a miracle. Thus Luther says, "Conversion is the
   greatest of all miracles." "Every day," he says, "witnesses miracle
   after miracle; that any village adheres to the Gospel when a hundred
   thousand devils are arrayed against it, or that the truth is maintained
   in this wicked world, is a continued miracle to which healing the sick
   or raising the dead is a mere trifle." As neither the etymology nor the
   usage of the word leads to a definite idea of the nature of a miracle,
   we can attain that idea only by the examination of some confessedly
   miraculous event.

   Definition of a Miracle.

   According to the "Westminster Confession," "God, in ordinary providence
   making use of means, yet is free to work without, above, or against
   them at pleasure." In the first place, there are events therefore due
   to the ordinary operations of second causes, as upheld and guided by
   God. To this class belong the common processes of nature; the growth of
   plants and animals, the orderly movements of the heavenly bodies; and
   the more unusual occurrences, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and
   violent agitations and revolutions in human societies. In the second
   place, there are events due to the influences of the Holy Spirit upon
   the hearts of men, such as regeneration, sanctification, spiritual
   illumination, etc. Thirdly, there are events which belong to neither of
   these classes, and whose distinguishing characteristics are, First,
   that they take place in the external world, i.e., in the sphere of the
   observation of the senses; and Secondly, that they are produced or
   caused by the simple volition of God, without the intervention of any
   subordinate cause. To this class belongs the original act of creation,
   in which all coöperation of second causes was impossible. To the same
   class belong all events truly miraculous. A miracle, therefore, may be
   defined to be an event, in the external world, brought about by the
   immediate efficiency, or simple volition of God.

   An examination of any of the great miracles recorded in Scripture will
   establish the correctness of this definition. The raising of Lazarus
   from the dead may be taken as an example. This was an event which
   occurred in the outward world; one which could be seen and verified by
   the testimony of the senses. It was not brought about either in whole
   or in part by the efficiency of natural causes. It was due to the
   simple word, or volition, or immediate agency of God. The same may be
   said of the restoration to life of the daughter of the ruler of the
   synagogue, on Christ's pronouncing the words, Talitha cumi; and of his
   healing the lepers by a word. So when Christ walked upon the sea, when
   He multiplied the loaves and fishes, when He calmed the winds and the
   waves by a command; any coöperation of physical causes is not only
   ignored, but, by clearest intimation, denied.

   Objections to this Definition of a Miracle.

   It is objected to this definition of a miracle that it assumes that the
   laws of nature may be violated or set aside. To this many theologians
   and men of science object, and declare that it is impossible. If the
   law of nature be the will of God, that of course cannot be set aside,
   much less directly violated. This is Augustine's objection, who asks,
   "Quomodo est contra naturam, quod Dei fit voluntate cum voluntas tanti
   utique conditoris conditæ rei cujusque natura sit? Portentum ergo fit,
   non contra naturam, sed contra quam est nota natura." [579] Baden
   Powell, in behalf of men of science, protests against being called upon
   to believe in anything "at variance with nature and law." "The enlarged
   critical and inductive study of the natural world," he says, "cannot
   but tend powerfully to evince the inconceivableness of imagined
   interruptions of natural order or supposed suspensions of the laws of
   matter, and of that vast series of dependent causation which
   constitutes the legitimate field for the investigation of science,
   whose constancy is the sole warrant for its generalizations, while it
   forms the substantial basis for the grand conclusions of natural
   theology." [580] The question of miracles, he says, [581] is not one
   "which can be decided by a few trite and commonplace generalities as to
   the moral government of the world and the belief in the Divine
   Omnipotence, or as to the validity of human testimony or the limits of
   human experience. It involves, and is essentially built upon, those
   grander conceptions of the order of nature, those comprehensive primary
   elements of all physical knowledge, those ultimate ideas of universal
   causation, which can only be familiar to those versed in cosmical
   philosophy in its widest sense." "It is for the most part hazardous
   ground for any general moral reasoner to take, to discuss subjects of
   evidence which essentially involve that higher appreciation of physical
   truth which can be attained only from an accurate and comprehensive
   acquaintance with the connected series of the physical and mathematical
   sciences. Thus, for example, the simple but grand truth of the law of
   conservation, and the stability of the heavenly motions, now well
   understood by all sound cosmical philosophers, is but a type of the
   universal self-sustaining and self-evolving powers which pervade all
   nature." [582] Professor Powell's conclusion is, "if miracles were, in
   the estimation of a former age, among the chief supports of
   Christianity, they are at present among the main difficulties and
   hinderances to its acceptance." [583] His whole argument is this,
   miracles, as usually defined, involve a suspension, or alteration, or
   violation of the laws of nature; but those laws are absolutely
   immutable, therefore that definition must be incorrect, or, in other
   words, miracles in that sense must be impossible.

   Answer to the above Objection.

   The form in which the objection is presented by those who make nature
   the will of God, is answered by saying that nature is not the will of
   God in any other sense than that He ordained the sequence of natural
   events, and established the laws or physical causes by which that
   regular sequence is secured. This relation between God and the world,
   assumes that nature and its laws are subject to Him, and therefore
   liable at any time to be suspended or counteracted, at his good
   pleasure.

   As to the other form of the objection, which assumes that the laws of
   nature are in themselves immutable, and therefore that they cannot be
   suspended, it is enough to say, (1.) That this absolute immutability of
   natural laws is a gratuitous assumption. That a thing has been is no
   proof that it must always be. There is no absolute certainty, because
   no necessity, that the sun will rise to-morrow. We assume with
   confidence that it will thus rise, but on what ground? What
   impossibility is there that this night the voice of the angel should be
   heard, swearing, "That time shall be no longer?" If time began, time
   may end. If nature began to be, it may cease to be, and all about it
   must be liable to change. Scientific men have no right to assume that
   because physical laws are, and, within the limits of our experience,
   ever have been, regular in their operation, that they are, as Professor
   Powell says, "self-sustaining and self-evolving." It is a great mistake
   to suppose that uniformity is inconsistent with voluntary control; that
   because law reigns, God does not reign. The laws of nature are uniform
   only because He so wills, and their uniformity continues only so long
   as He wills.

   (2.) It is utterly derogatory to the character of God to assume that He
   is subject to law, and especially to the laws of matter. If theism be
   once admitted, then it must be admitted that the whole universe, with
   all that it contains and all the laws by which it is controlled, must
   he subject to the will of God. Professor Powell indeed says, that many
   theists deny the possibility of the suspension or violation of the laws
   of nature, but then he says that there are many degrees of theism, and
   he includes under that term theories which others regard as
   inconsistent with the doctrine of a personal God. It is certain that
   the objection to the definition of a miracle given above, now under
   consideration, depends for its validity on the assumption, that God is
   subject to nature that He cannot control its laws. J. Müller well says,
   "Etiamsi nullus alius miraculorum esset usus, nisi ut absolutam illam
   divinæ voluntatis libertatem demonstrent, humanamque arrogantiam,
   immodicæ legis naturalis admirationi junctam, compescant, miracula haud
   temere essent edita." [584]

   (3.) The authority of Scripture is for Christians decisive on this
   point. The Bible everywhere not only asserts the absolute independence
   of God of all his works, and his absolute control over them, but is
   also filled with examples of the actual exercise ef this control. Every
   miracle recorded in the Scriptures is such an example. When Christ
   called Lazarus from the grave, the chemical forces which were working
   the dissolution of his body ceased to operate. When He said to the
   winds, Be still, the physical causes which produced the storm were
   arrested in their operation; when He walked on the sea the law of
   gravitation was counteracted by a stronger force --even the divine
   will. In 2 Kings vi. 5, 6, we are told that an "axe head fell into the
   water," and that the man of God cut a stick and cast it into the water,
   "and the iron did swim." Here an effect was produced which all known
   physical laws would tend to prevent. The Scriptures, therefore, by word
   and deed, teach that God can act, not only with physical causes, but
   without and against them.

   (4.) After all, the suspension or violation of the laws of nature
   involved in miracles is nothing more than is constantly taking place
   around us. One force counteracts another; vital force keeps the
   chemical laws of matter in abeyance; and muscular force can control the
   action of physical force. When a man raises a weight from the ground,
   the law of gravity is neither suspended nor violated, but counteracted
   by a stronger force. The same is true as to the walking of Christ on
   the water, and the swimming of the iron at the command of the prophet.
   The simple and grand truth that the universe is not under the exclusive
   control of physical forces, but that everywhere and always there is
   above, separate from, and superior to all else, an infinite personal
   will, not superseding, but directing and controlling all physical
   causes, acting with or without them. The truth on this subject was
   beautifully expressed by Sir Isaac Newton, when he said, "Deum esse ens
   summe perfectum concedunt omnes. Entis autem summe perfecti Idea est ut
   sit substantia una, simplex, indivisibilis, viva et vivifica, ubique
   semper necessario existens, summe intelligens omnia, libere volens
   bona, voluntate efficiens possibilia, effectibus nobilioribus
   similitudinem propriam quantum fieri potest, communicans, omnia in se
   continens, tanquam eorum principium et locus, omnia per præsentiam
   substantialem cernens et regens, et cum rebus omnibus, secundum leges
   accuratas ut naturæ totius fundamentum et causa constanter coöperans,
   nisi ubi aliter agere bonum est." [585] God is the author of nature: He
   has ordained its laws: He is everywhere present in his works: He
   governs all things by coöperating and using the laws which He has
   ordained, NISI UBI ALITER AGERE BONUM EST. He has left Himself free.

   Higher Laws.

   A second objection to the usual definition of miracles, is that they
   should be referred to some higher, occult law of nature and not to the
   immediate agency of God. This objection is urged by two very different
   classes of writers. First, those who adopt the mechanical theory of the
   universe assume that God has given it up to the government of natural
   laws, and no more interferes with its natural operations than a
   ship-builder with the navigation of the ships he has constructed. This
   is the view presented by Babbage in his "Ninth Bridgewater Treatise."
   He supposes a man placed before his calculating machine, which for
   millions and millions of times produces square numbers; then for once
   produces a cube number; and then only squares until the machine wears
   out. There are two ways of accounting for the extraordinary cube
   number. The one is that the maker of the machine directly interfered
   for its production. The other is that he provided for its appearance in
   the original construction of the machine. The latter explanation gives
   a far higher idea of the skill and wisdom of the mechanist; and so, Mr.
   Babbage argues, it is "more consistent with the attributes of the Deity
   to look upon miracles not as deviations from the laws assigned by the
   Almighty for the government of matter and of mind; but as the exact
   fulfilment of much more extensive laws than those we suppose to exist."
   [586] In like manner Professor Baden Powell, contends that every
   physical effect must have a physical cause, and therefore that
   miracles, considered as physical events, must be "referred to physical
   causes, possibly to known causes; but, at all events, to some higher
   cause or law, if at present unknown." [587]

   Secondly, this same ground is taken by many who do not thus banish God
   from his works. They admit that He is everywhere present, and
   everywhere acting, controlling physical laws so as to accomplish his
   purposes; but they insist that He never operates immediately, but
   always acts through the established laws of nature. Thus the Duke of
   Argyle, whose excellent work on the "Reign of Law" is thoroughly
   religious, says: [588] "There is nothing in religion incompatible with
   the belief that all exercises of God's power, whether ordinary or
   extraordinary, are effected through the instrumentality of means --that
   is to say, by the instrumentality of natural laws brought out, as it
   were, and used for a divine purpose." He begins his book with
   quotations from M. Guizo's work, "L'Eglise et la Société Chrétienne en
   1861," to the effect that belief in the supernatural is the special
   difficulty of our time; that the denial of it is the form taken by all
   modern assaults on Christian faith; and that acceptance of it lies at
   the root, not only of Christianity, but of all positive religion
   whatever. By the supernatural, he understood Guizot to mean, what the
   word does properly and commonly mean, namely, what transcends nature;
   and by nature is meant all things out of God. A supernatural event,
   therefore, in this sense, which is Guizot's sense of the word, is an
   event which transcends the power of nature, and which is due to the
   immediate agency of God. M. Guizot is undoubtedly correct in saying
   that the belief in the supernatural, thus explained, is the great
   difficulty of the age. The tendency, not only of science, but of
   speculation in all departments, is, at least for the time being, to in
   merge every thing into nature and to admit of no other causes.

   Although the Duke of Argyle is a theist, and admits of the constant
   operation of the Divine will in nature, he is still urgent in insisting
   that the power of God in nature is always exercised according to law,
   and in connection with physical causes. Miracles, therefore, differ
   from ordinary events only in so far as the law according to which they
   come to pass, or the physical forces acting in their production are
   unknown. He quotes with approbation from Locke, the following most
   unsatisfactory definition: "A miracle, then, I take to be a sensible
   operation, which, being above the comprehension of the spectator, and,
   in his opinion, contrary to the established course of nature, is taken
   by him to be divine." [589] This is the precise view held by Baden
   Powell, who in the essay repeatedly referred to above, makes a miracle
   a mere matter of opinion. It is not a matter of fact to be determined
   by testimony, but a matter of opinion as to the cause of that fact. The
   fact may be admitted, and one man may say it is due to natural law,
   known or unknown; and then it is no miracle. Another man says it is due
   to the immediate power of God. In that case it is a miracle. Which of
   the two is correct, cannot be decided by testimony. It must be decided
   by the general views of nature and of God's relation to the world,
   which men entertain. The doctrine that God works in the external world
   only through physical force, and even that He can act only in that way,
   leads, of necessity, to the conclusion that miracles are events in the
   external world brought about by unknown physical causes. They prove
   only "the presence of superhuman knowledge and the working of
   superhuman power." [590]

   Objections to the Doctrine of a Higher Law.

   (1.) With regard to this theory, it may be remarked in the first place,
   that it is a perfectly gratuitous hypothesis. It assumes the existence
   of laws of nature without necessity and without evidence. By laws, in
   such connections, is usually meant either the ordered sequence of
   events, or the power by which that sequence is secured. In either case
   there is this ordered sequence. But where is the evidence that anywhere
   in the universe the living of the dead, the recovery of the sick, the
   stilling of the storm, and the swimming of iron, follow as matters of
   course on a command? The Church doctrine on miracles gives a simple,
   rational, and satisfactory account of their occurrence, which renders
   all assumption of unknown laws unnecessary and unjustifiable. It is
   utterly impossible to prove, as this theory assumes, that every
   physical effect must have a physical cause. Our own wills are causes in
   the sphere of nature; and the omnipotent will of God is not tied to any
   one mode of operation.

   (2.) This hypothesis is not only unnecessary, but it is unsatisfactory.
   There are miracles which transcend not only all known, but all possible
   laws of nature. Nature cannot create. It cannot originate life;
   otherwise it would be God, and nothing beyond nature would be necessary
   to account for the universe and for all that it contains. As,
   therefore, there are miracles which cannot be accounted for by "a
   higher law of nature," it is clear that they are to be referred to the
   immediate power of God, and not to some unknown physical force. All
   theists are obliged to acknowledge this immediate agency of God in the
   original act of creation. Then there were no laws or forces through
   which his efficiency could be exercised. The fact, therefore, on which
   the Church doctrine on this subject rests must be admitted.

   (3.) The Scriptures not only are silent about any higher law as the
   cause of miraculous events, but they always refer them to the immediate
   power of God. Christ said He cast out devils by the finger of God. He
   never referred to anything but his own will as the efficient antecedent
   of the effect produced, "I will, be thou clean," He healed by a touch
   --by a word. When he gave miraculous powers to the Apostles, He did not
   make them alchemists. They did not claim knowledge of occult laws.
   Peter, when called to account for the healing of the lame man in the
   temple, said that it was the name of Christ, faith in his name that had
   made the man every whit whole. It is moreover plain that, on this
   theory, miracles must lose their value as proofs of a divine
   commission. If the Apostles did the wonders which they performed by the
   knowledge of, or through the efficiency of natural laws, then they are
   on the level of the experimenter who makes water freeze in a red hot
   spoon. If God be not the author of the miracle, it does not prove a
   divine message.

   (4.) There is force also in what the Rev. J. B. Mozley says: "To say
   that the material fact which takes place in a miracle admits of being
   referred to an unknown natural cause, is not to say that the miracle
   itself does. A miracle is the material fact as coinciding with an
   express announcement or with express supernatural pretensions in the
   agent. It is this correspondence of two facts which constitutes a
   miracle. If a person says to a blind man, See,' and he sees, it is not
   the sudden return of sight alone that we have to account for, but its
   return at that particular moment. For it is morally impossible that
   this exact agreement of an event with a command or notification could
   have been by mere chance, or, as we should say, been an extraordinary
   coincidence, especially if it is repeated in other cases." [591] It is
   very certain that no one who saw Lazarus rise from the grave, when
   Jesus said, "Lazarus, come forth," ever thought of any physical law as
   the cause of that event.

   Miracles and Extraordinary Providences.

   A third objection urged against the definition above given is, that it
   is not sufficiently comprehensive. It does not cover a large class of
   miracles recorded in the Scriptures. In the sudden rising of a fog
   which conceals an army and thus saves it from destruction in a storm
   which disperses a hostile fleet and thus saves a nation, -- any such
   providential intervention, it is said, we have all the elements
   included in many of the miracles recorded in the Bible. The events
   occur in the external world; they are not due to mere physical causes,
   but to such causes guided by the immediate agency of God, and directed
   to the accomplishment of a particular end. This is all that can be said
   of many of the plagues inflicted on the Egyptians; of the flight of
   quails to supply the wants of the Hebrews in the desert; and of the
   draught of fishes recorded in the Gospels.

   It is true that the strict definition of a miracle does not include
   events of the kind just mentioned. Such events, therefore, are called
   by Trench "providential," as distinguished from "absolute miracles."
   This want of comprehensiveness, however, does not seem to be a
   sufficient reason for rejecting the common definition of a miracle.
   Because there certainly is a class of events to which that definition
   strictly applies; and it is important that those events on which such
   stress is laid in Scripture, should have a designation peculiar to
   themselves, and which expresses their true nature. The importance of
   what are called providential miracles, is not lessened by their being
   thrown into a class by themselves. They continue to be clear evidence
   of divine intervention. As Mr. Mozley says, it is not exclusively on
   the nature of the event that its value as evidence depends, but on the
   attending circumstances. The flocks of locusts, or of the quails, would
   not, of themselves, have been proof of any special divine intervention;
   but taken in connection with Moses' threat in the one case, and promise
   in the other, those events proved as conclusively as the most absolute
   miracle could have done, that he was the messenger of Him who could
   control the laws of nature and constrain them to execute his will.

   § 2. The Possibility of Miracles.

   This is of course denied by all those who do not make any distinction
   between God and nature. This is done by Spinoza and all his modern
   disciples. "Existimant," says Spinoza, "Deum tamdiu nihil agere,
   quamdiu natura solito ordine agit; et contra, potentiam naturæ et
   causas naturales tamdiu esse oticsas, quam diu Deus agit; duas itaque
   potentias numero ab invicem distinctas imaginantur, scilicet, potentiam
   Dei et potentiam rerum naturalium, a Deo tamen certo modo
   determinatam." [592] As he denies that there is any distinction between
   the power of God and the power of nature, he of course denies that
   there is any ground for the distinction between natural and
   supernatural events. "Leges naturæ universales," he says, "mera esse
   decreta Dei, quæ ex necessitate et perfectione naturæ divinæ sequuntur.
   Si quid igitur in natura contingeret, quod ejus universalibus legibus
   repugnaret, id decreto et intellectui et naturæ divinæ necessario etiam
   repugnaret; aut si quis statueret, Deum aliquid contra leges naturæ
   agere, is simul etiam cogeretur statuere, Deum contra suam naturam
   agere, quo nihil absurdius. [593] . . . . Ex his -- sequitur, nomen
   miraculi non nisi respective ad hominum opiniones posse intelligi, et
   nihil aliud significare quam opus, cujus causam naturalem exemplo
   alterius rei solitæ explicare non possumus. [594] . . . . Per Dei
   directionem intelligo fixum illum et immutabilem naturæ ordinem, sive
   rerum naturalium concatenationem. -- Sive igitur dicamus, omnia
   secundum leges naturæ fieri, sive ex Dei decreto et directione
   ordinari, idem dicimus." [595] The Pantheistic theory, therefore, which
   teaches "that the government of the world is not the determination of
   events by an extramundane intelligence, but by reason as immanent in
   the cosmical forces themselves and in their relations," [596] precludes
   the possibility of a miracle.

   It is only a modification of the same general view when it is said that
   although the world's material and mental have a real existence, there
   is no causality out of God. Second causes are only the occasions or the
   modes in which the divine efficiency is exerted. This doctrine
   effectually excludes all distinction between the natural and the
   supernatural, between what is due to the immediate power of God and
   what is due to the efficiency of second causes. The operations of God,
   when uniform, we call laws, says Bretschneider; when rare or isolated,
   we call them miracles. The only difference is in our mode of viewing
   them. A third objection of the same general character is that miracles
   suppose separate, individual acts of the divine will, which is
   inconsistent with the nature of an absolute Being. "A God who performs
   individual acts, it is very clear, may be a person, but cannot be
   absolute. In turning Himself from one act to another, or now putting
   forth a certain kind of efficiency (the extraordinary), and then
   resting again, He does and is at one moment what He does not and is not
   at another, and thus falls into the category of the changeable, the
   temporary, and the finite. If we continue to regard Him as absolute,
   his working is to be conceived as an eternal act, simple and uniform in
   its nature as it proceeds from God, and only in the phenomenal world
   revealing its fulness in a series of various and changing divine
   operations." [597]

   This is an objection which has already been repeatedly considered. All
   that need be said in answer to it at present, is that it proves too
   much. If valid against miracles, it is valid against the doctrine of a
   creation ex nihilo, against providence, against revelation, against
   prophecies, against hearing of prayer, and against all the operations
   of grace. In all these cases as much as in miracles, there is an
   assumption of direct agency on the part of God. And if such immediate
   agency implies separate acts of the divine will in one of these cases,
   it must in all the rest. So that if the objection be valid against
   miracles it is valid against the doctrine of a personal God, and the
   whole system of natural and revealed religion. Whatever evidence,
   therefore, we have for the being of God and for the reality of
   religion, we have also to prove that this objection is sophistical,
   founded on our ignorance of the mode in which the infinite Being
   reveals and manifests Himself in the finite. Nothing is more certain
   than that God does act everywhere and always, and nothing is more
   inscrutable than the mode of his action.

   A fourth objection to miracles is founded on the deistical theory that
   the relation of God to the world is analogous to that of a mechanist to
   a machine. A mechanist has no occasion to interfere in the working of
   an engine which he has made, except to correct its irregularities; so
   if God interferes in the natural order of events as produced by the
   secondary causes which He has ordained, it can only be because of the
   imperfection of his work. As this cannot be rationally admitted,
   neither can the doctrine of miracles, which supposes such special
   interference, be admitted. This objection is answered by showing that
   the relation of God to the world is not that of a mechanist to a
   machine, but of an everywhere-present, all-controlling, intelligent
   will. The doctrine of miracles, therefore, is founded on the doctrine
   of theism, that is, of an extramundane personal God, who, being
   distinct from the world, upholds and governs it according to his own
   will. It assumes, moreover, that second causes have a real efficiency
   to which ordinary events are proximately due; that the divine
   efficiency does not supersede those causes, but upholds and guides them
   in their operations. But at the same time this almighty and omnipresent
   Being is free to act with or without or against those causes, as he
   sees fit; so that it is just as consistent with his nature and with his
   relation to the world that the effects of his power should be
   immediate, i.e., without the intervention of natural causes, as through
   their instrumentality. That this is the true Scriptural doctrine
   concerning God and his relation to the world cannot be disputed. It is
   admitted even by those who deny the truth of the doctrine. "Die ganze
   christliche Anschauung von dem Verhältniss Gottes zur Welt, von
   Schöpfung, Vorsehung und Wunder bezeugt diess (namely, that the
   Absolute is a person). Der Persönlichkeit ist freier Wille wesentlich;
   die Freiheit verwirklicht sich in einzelnen beliebigen Willensacten:
   durch einen solchen hat Gott die Welt geschaffen, durch eine Reihe von
   solchen regiert er sie, durch solche Acte greift er auch ausser der
   Ordnung seiner continuirlichen weltlenkenden Thätigkeit in die
   Weltordnung ein." [598]

   § 3. Can a Miracle be known as such?

   This is denied on various grounds.

   1. It is said, if a miracle be an event which transcends the efficiency
   of second causes we must have a perfect knowledge of the power of such
   causes, before we can decide that a particular event is miraculous. But
   as such perfect knowledge is impossible, it must be impossible for us
   to decide whether it is a miracle or not. It must be admitted that in
   many cases the mere nature of an event does not afford a certain
   criterion of its character as natural or supernatural. To savages many
   effects which to us are easily accountable as the product of natural
   causes, appear to be miraculous. An adept in the arts of legerdemain,
   or a man of science, may do many things entirely unaccountable by the
   uninitiated, which they therefore cannot distinguish from miracles by
   anything in the mere nature of the effects themselves. But this
   objection applies only to a certain class of miracles. There are some
   events which so evidently transcend the power of nature that there can
   be no rational doubt as to their supernatural origin. No creature can
   create or originate life, or work without the intervention of means. A
   large class of the miracles recorded in Scripture imply the exercise of
   a power which can belong to God alone. The multiplying a few loaves and
   fishes so as to satisfy the hunger of thousands of men raising the
   dead, and giving sight to the blind and hearing to the deaf, not by the
   appliances of art, but by a command, are clearly effects which imply
   the exercise of almighty power. Besides, it is to be considered that
   the nature of the event is not the only criterion by which we are to
   determine its character. To prove an event in the external world to be
   miraculous, we have only to prove that it is not the effect of any
   natural cause, and that it is to be referred to the immediate agency of
   God. To produce this conviction moral evidence is quite as effective as
   any other. Such an event may be, as far as we can see, supernatural,
   either in its nature or in the mode of its occurrence, but that alone
   would not justify us in referring it to God. Much depends on the
   character of the agent and the design for which the wonder is wrought.
   If these be evidently bad, we cannot be convinced that God has wrought
   a miracle. But if both the character of the agent and the design of his
   work are good, then we are easily and rationally convinced that the
   wonder is really a miracle.

   Lying Wonders.

   2. This remark applies equally to another ground on which it is denied
   that we can certainly determine any event to be miraculous. An effect
   may transcend all the powers of all material causes and the power of
   man, and nevertheless be within the compass of the ability of
   superhuman intelligences. There are rational creatures superior to man,
   endowed with far higher capacities. These exalted intelligences have
   access to our world; they do exercise their powers in producing effects
   in the realm of nature; and therefore, it is said, we cannot tell
   whether an event, admitted to be supernatural (in the limited sense of
   that word), is to be referred to God or to these spiritual beings. Such
   is the latitude with which the words "signs and wonders" are used in
   the Scriptures, that they apply not only to works due to God's
   immediate agency, but to those effected by the power of evil spirits.
   On this account many theologians regard the latter as true miracles.
   They are called "lying wonders," says Gerhard, [599] not as to their
   form (or nature), but as to their end, i.e., because designed to
   promote error. Trench takes the same view; he says it is not a matter
   of doubt to him that the Scriptures attribute real wonders to Satan.
   The question is not, Whether the works of the Egyptian Magicians and
   the predicted wonders of Antichrist are to be regarded as tricks and
   juggleries. It may be admitted that they were, or are to be the works
   of Satan and his angels. But the question is, Are they to be regarded
   as true miracles? The answer to this question depends on the meaning of
   the word. If by a miracle we mean any event transcending the efficiency
   of physical causes and the power of man, then they are miracles. But if
   we adhere to the definition above given, which requires that the event
   be produced by the immediate power of God, they of course are not
   miracles. They are "lying wonders," not only because intended to
   sustain the kingdom of lies, but because they falsely profess to be
   what they are not. Thus Thomas Aquinas says: [600] Demones possunt
   facere miracula: quæ scilicet homines mirantur, in quantum eorum
   facultatem et cognitionem excedunt." They are only wonders in the sight
   of men.

   The difficulty of discriminating between miracles and these lying
   wonders, i.e., between the works of God and the works of Satan, has
   been anticipated and provided for by the sacred writers themselves. In
   Deut. xiii. 1-3, Moses says, "If there arise among you a prophet
   . . . . and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, and the sign or thine
   wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go
   after other gods thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that
   prophet." In Matt. vii. 22, 23, our Lord says, "Many will say to me in
   that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy
   name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
   And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye
   that work iniquity." Matt. xxiv. 24, "There shall arise false Christs,
   and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch
   that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect." In 2
   Thess. ii. 9, the Apostle teaches us that the coming of the man of sin
   shall be "after the working of Satan, with all power and signs and
   lying wonders." These passages teach that supernatural events, i.e.,
   events transcending the power of material causes and the ability of
   man, may be brought about by the agency of higher intelligences; and
   that no such supernatural events are to be regarded as of any authority
   if produced by wicked agents, or for a wicked purpose. It was on this
   principle our Lord answered the Pharisees who accused Him of casting
   out devils by Beelzebub the prince of devils. He appealed to the design
   for which his miracles were wrought to prove that they could not be
   referred to a Satanic influence. Satan will not coöperate to confirm
   the truth or to promote good. God cannot coöperate to confirm what is
   false or to promote evil. So that the character of the agent and the
   design for which a supernatural event is brought about determine
   whether it is truly a miracle, or whether it is one of the lying
   wonders of the devil. From the Scriptures this criterion of miracles
   was adopted by the Church. Luther says, "Against authenticated
   doctrines, no signs or wonders, however great or numerous, are to be
   admitted; for we have the command of God, who said from heaven, Hear
   him,' to listen only unto Christ." Chemnitz [601] says, "Miracula non
   debent præferri doctrinæ. . . . neque enim contra doctrinam a Deo
   revelatam ulla miracula valere debent." Gerhard [602] says, "Miracula,
   si non habeant doctrinæ veritatem conjunctam nihil probant." Brochmann
   also says, [603] "Ut opus aliquod sit verum miraculum duo requiruntur.
   Unum, est veritas rei; alterum, veritas finis."

   To this it may be objected, that it is reasoning in a circle to prove
   the truth of the doctrine from the miracle, and then the truth of the
   miracle from the doctrine. We answer, however, (1.) That this moral
   criterion is needed only in the doubtful class of miracles. There are
   certain events which from their nature can have no other author than
   God. They transcend not only the powers of matter and of man, but all
   created power. The efficiency of creatures has known limits,
   determined, if not by reason, at least by the Word of God. (2.) It is
   not unusual nor unreasonable that two kinds of evidence should be
   dependent and yet mutually confirmatory. In the case of a historian, we
   may believe his authorities to be what he says they are, on account of
   his character; and we may believe his statements on account of his
   authorities. So we may believe a good man, when he says that the
   wonders which he performs are not tricks, or effects produced by the
   coöperation of evil spirits, but by the power of God, and we may
   believe his teachings to be divine because of the wonders. The Bible
   assumes that men have an intuitive perception of what is good; and it
   assumes that God is on the side of goodness and Satan on the side of
   evil. If a wonder, therefore, be wrought in favour of what is good, it
   is from God; if in support of what is evil, it is from Satan. This is
   one of the grounds on which Protestants give themselves so little
   concern about the pretended miracles of the Romish church. They do not
   feel it to be necessary to disprove them by a critical examination of
   their nature, or of the circumstances under which they were performed,
   or of the evidence by which they are supported. Not one in a thousand
   of them could stand the test of such an examination; most of them,
   indeed, are barefaced impostures openly justified by the authorities on
   the ground of pious frauds. It is a sufficient reason for repudiating,
   prior to any examination, all such pretended miracles, that they are
   wrought in support of an antichristian system, that they are part of a
   complicated mass of deceit and evil.

   Insufficiency of Human Testimony.

   There is still another ground on which the possibility of a miracles
   being known or proved has been denied. It is said that no evidence is
   adequate to establish the occurrence of a miraculous event. Our faith
   in miracles must rest on historical testimony. Historical testimony is
   only the testimony of men liable to be deceived. All confidence in such
   testimony is founded on experience. Experience, however, teaches that
   human testimony is not always reliable; whereas our experience, that
   the course of nature is uniform, is without exception. It will,
   therefore, always be more probable that the witnesses were mistaken
   than that the course of nature has been violated. This is Hume's famous
   argument, of which Babbage says that it, "divested of its less
   important adjuncts, never has and never will be refuted." [604] He
   evidently means that it cannot be refuted except mathematically,
   through the doctrine of probabilities. For he says on a subsequent
   page, that those who support the prejudice against mathematical
   pursuits, "must now be compelled to admit that they have endeavoured to
   discredit a science which alone can furnish an exact refutation of one
   of the most celebrated arguments against revelation." [605] He
   endeavours to prove the reverse of Hume's proposition; that is, that on
   the doctrine of probabilities, it is unspeakably more probable that
   there should be a violation of the laws of nature (e. g., that a dead
   man should come to life) than that six independent witnesses should
   concur in testifying to the same falsehood. The argument may be valid
   in the view of mathematicians; but to ordinary men it seems to be a
   wrong application of the principles of that venerable science. As we
   cannot determine by the law of probabilities a question in æsthetics or
   morals, neither can God's relation to the world, and the use of his
   power, as involved in the doctrine of miracles, be thus determined. It
   does depend on the validity of human testimony. However uncertain or
   unreliable such testimony may be, such events as miracles may happen,
   if consistent with the nature of God, and may be rationally believed.
   There may be proofs of their reality which no man can disregard. It is,
   however, as just remarked, a false assumption that human testimony is
   inadequate to produce absolute certainty. Men do not hesitate on the
   testimony of even two men to consign a fellow-man to death. In order
   that human testimony should command assent it must, (1.) Be given in
   proof of a possible event. The impossible cannot be proved by any kind
   of evidence. Professor Powell asks, How much testimony would be
   required to prove that two and two had, on a given occasion, made five?
   As no amount of testimony could prove such an impossibility, the
   argument is that no amount of evidence can prove a miracle. If miracles
   be impossible, that is an end of the matter. No man is so foolish as to
   pretend that the impossible can be proved. (2.) The second condition of
   the credibility of testimony is that the event admit of easy
   verification. If a man testify that he saw a ghost, it may be true that
   he saw something which he took to be a ghost; but the fact cannot be
   verified. The resurrection of Christ, for example, the miracle on the
   truth of which our salvation depends, was an event which could be
   authenticated. The identity between the dead and living Jesus could be
   established beyond the possibility of any reasonable doubt. (3.) The
   witnesses must have satisfactory knowledge or evidence of the truth of
   the facts to which they testify. Had the Apostles seen Christ after his
   resurrection only on one occasion, at a great distance, in an obscure
   light, and only for a fleeting moment, the value of their testimony
   would be greatly impaired. But as they saw Him repeatedly during forty
   days, conversed with Him, ate with Him, and handled Him, it is out of
   the question that they should have been mistaken. (4.) The witnesses
   themselves should be sober-minded, intelligent men. (5.) They should be
   good men. The testimony of other men, under these conditions, may be as
   coercive as that of our own senses. And it may be so confirmed by
   collateral evidence, natural and supernatural, by the nature of effects
   produced, and by signs and wonders and gifts of the Holy Ghost, as to
   render unbelief a miracle of folly and wickedness.

   The fallacy of Hume's argument has often been pointed out. in the first
   place, it rests on the false assumption that confidence in human
   testimony is founded on experience, whereas it is founded on a law of
   our nature. We cannot help confiding in good men. We know that deceit
   is inconsistent with goodness; and therefore know and are forced to
   believe, that good men will not intentionally deceive; and, therefore,
   by a law of our nature we are compelled to receive their testimony as
   to facts within them personal knowledge. Experience, instead of being
   the foundation of belief in testimony, corrects our credulity by
   teaching us the conditions under which alone human testimony can be
   safely trusted. In the second place, Hume assumes that there is a
   violent antecedent improbability against the occurrence of a miracle,
   which only a "miraculous" amount of evidence could counterbalance. It
   is indeed not only incredible, but inconceivable, that a miracle should
   be wrought without an adequate reason. But that God, on great occasions
   and for the highest ends, should intervene with the immediate exercise
   of his power in the course of events, is what might be confidently
   anticipated. Theism being granted, the difficulty about miracles
   disappears, but by theism is not meant the mere admission that
   something is God, whether nature, force, motion, or moral order; but
   the doctrine of a personal extramundane Being, the Creator and Governor
   of all things, who does according to his own will in the army of heaven
   and among the inhabitants of the earth; a God who is untrammelled by
   cosmical influences or laws.

   In the third place, Hume's argument assumes that our faith in miracles
   rests exclusively on human testimony. This is not the fact. The
   miracles recorded in the Scriptures are a competent part of the great
   system of truth therein revealed. The whole stands or falls together.
   Our faith in miracles, therefore, is sustained by all the evidence
   which authenticates the gospel of Christ. And that evidence is not to
   be even touched by a balance of probabilities.

   § 4. The Value of Miracles as a Proof of a Divine Revelation.

   On this subject extreme opinions have been held. On the one hand, it
   has been maintained that miracles are the only satisfactory evidence of
   a divine revelation; on the other, that they are neither necessary nor
   available. It is argued by some that, as faith must be rounded on the
   apprehension of truth as truth, it is impossible that any amount of
   external evidence can produce faith, or enable us to see that to be
   true which we could not so apprehend without it. How can a miracle
   enable us to see a proposition of Euclid to be true, or a landscape to
   be beautiful? Such reasoning is fallacious. It overlooks the nature of
   faith as a conviction of things not seen on adequate testimony. What
   the Bible teaches on this subject is (1.) That the evidence of miracles
   is important and decisive (2.) That it is, nevertheless, subordinate
   and inferior to that of the truth itself. Both of these points are
   abundantly evident from the language of the Bible and from the facts
   therein contained. (1.) That God has confirmed his revelations, whether
   made by prophets or Apostles, by these manifestations of his power, is
   of itself a sufficient proof of their validity and importance as seals
   of a divine mission. (2.) The sacred writers under both dispensations
   appealed to these wonders as proofs that they were the messengers of
   God. In the New Testament it is said that God confirmed the testimony
   of his Apostles by signs and wonders and divers miracles and gifts of
   the Holy Ghost. Even our Lord himself, in whom the fulness of the
   Godhead dwelt bodily, was approved by miracles, signs, and wonders
   which God did by Him. (Acts ii. 22.) (3.) Christ constantly appealed to
   his miracles as a decisive proof of his divine mission. "The works," he
   says, "which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I
   do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me." (John v. 20,
   36.) And John x. 25, "The works that I do in my Father's name, they
   bear witness of me;" and in verse 38, "Though ye believe not me,
   believe the works." John vii. 17, "If any man will do his will, he
   shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of
   myself." Undoubtedly the highest evidence of the truth is the truth
   itself; as the highest evidence of goodness is goodness itself. Christ
   is his own witness. His glory reveals Him, as the Son of God, to all
   whose eyes the God of this world has not blinded. The point which
   miracles are designed to prove is not so much the truth of the
   doctrines taught as the divine mission of the teacher. The latter,
   indeed, is in order to the former. What a man teaches may be true,
   although not divine as to its origin. But when a man presents himself
   as a messenger of God, whether he is to be received as such or not
   depends first on the doctrines which he teaches, and, secondly, upon
   the works which he performs. If he not only teaches doctrines conformed
   to the nature of God and consistent with the laws of our own
   constitution, but also performs works which evince divine power, then
   we know not only that the doctrines are true, but also that the teacher
   is sent of God.

CHAPTER XIII.

  ANGELS.

   So much is said in the Scriptures of good and evil angels, and such
   important functions are ascribed to them both in the providence of God
   over the world, and especially in the experience of his people and of
   his Church, that the doctrine of the Bible concerning them should not
   be overlooked. That there are intelligent creatures higher than man,
   has been a general belief. It is so consonant with the analogy of
   nature as to be in the highest degree probable, apart from any direct
   revelation on the subject. In all departments of nature there is a
   regular gradation from the lower to the higher forms of life; from the
   almost invisible vegetable fungus in plants to the cedar of Lebanon;
   from the minutest animalcule to the gigantic mammoth. In man we meet
   with the first, and to all appearances the lowest of rational
   creatures. That he should be the only creature of his order is, à
   priori, as improbable as that insects should be the only class of
   irrational animals. There is every reason to presume that the scale of
   being among rational creatures is as extensive as that in the animal
   world. The modern philosophy which deifies man leaves no room for any
   order of beings above him. But if the distance between God and man be
   infinite, all analogy would prove that the orders of rational creatures
   between us and God must be inconceivably numerous. As this is in itself
   probable, it is clearly revealed in the Bible to be true.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Their Nature.

   As to the nature of angels, they are described, (1.) As pure spirits,
   i.e., immaterial and incorporeal beings. The Scriptures do not
   attribute bodies of any kind to them. On the assumption that spirit
   unconnected with matter cannot act out of itself, that it can neither
   communicate with other spirits nor operate on the external world, it
   was maintained by many, and so decided in the council held at Nice,
   A.D. 784, that angels had bodies composed of ether or light; an opinion
   which was thought to be favoured by such passages as Matt. xxviii. 8,
   Luke ii. 9, and other passages in which their luminous appearance and
   the glory attending ther presence are spoken of. The Council of
   Lateran, A.D. 1215, decided that they were incorporeal, and this has
   been the common opinion in the Church. They are declared to be
   "substantiæ spirituales, omnis corporeæ molis expertes." As such,
   therefore, they are invisible, incorruptible, and immortal. Their
   relation to space is described as an illocalitas; not ubiquity or
   omnipresence, as they are always somewhere and not everywhere at any
   given moment, but they are not confined to space circumscriptively as
   bodies are, and can move from one portion of space to another. As
   spirits they are possessed of intelligence, will, and power. With
   regard to their knowledge, whether as to its modes or objects, nothing
   special is revealed. All that is clear is that in their intellectual
   faculties and in the extent of their knowledge they are far superior to
   man. Their power also is very great, and extends over mind and matter.
   They have the power to communicate one with another and with other
   minds, and to produce effects in the natural world. The greatness of
   their power is manifest, (a.) From the names and titles given to them,
   as principalities, powers, dominions, and world-rulers. (b.) From the
   direct assertions of Scripture, as they are said to "excel in
   strength;" and (c.) From the effects attributed to their agency.
   However great their power may be, it is nevertheless subject to all the
   limitations which belong to creatures. Angels, therefore, cannot
   create, they cannot change substances, they cannot alter the laws of
   nature, they cannot perform miracles, they cannot act without means,
   and they cannot search the heart; for all these are, in Scripture,
   declared to be prerogatives peculiar to God. The power of angels is,
   therefore, (1.) Dependent and derived. (2.) It must be exercised in
   accordance with the laws of the material and spiritual world. (3.)
   Their intervention is not optional, but permitted or commanded by God,
   and at his pleasure, and, so far as the external world is concerned, it
   would seem to be only occasional and exceptional. These limitations are
   of the greatest practical importance. We are not to regard angels as
   intervening between us and God, or to attribute to them the effects
   which the Bible everywhere refers to the providential agency of God.

   Wrong Views on the Subject.

   This Scriptural doctrine, universally received in the Church, stands
   opposed, (1.) To the theory that they were transient emanations from
   the Deity. (2.) To the Gnostic view that they were permanent emanations
   or æons: and (3.) To the rationalistic view, which denies them any real
   existence, and refers the Scriptural statements either to popular
   superstitions adopted by the sacred writers in accommodation to the
   opinions of the age, or to poetical personifications of the powers of
   nature. The grounds on which the modern philosophy denies the existence
   of angels have no force in opposition to the explicit statements of the
   Bible, which cannot be rejected without rejecting the authority of
   Scripture altogether, or adopting such principles of interpretation as
   destroys its value as a rule of faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 2. Their State.

   As to the state of the angels, it is clearly taught that they were all
   originally holy. It is also plainly to be inferred from the statements
   of the Bible that they were subjected to a period of probation, and
   that some kept and some did not keep their first estate. Those who
   maintained their integrity are represented as confirmed in a state of
   holiness and glory. This condition, although one of complete security,
   is one of perfect liberty; for the most absolute freedom in action is,
   according to the Bible, consistent with absolute certainty as to the
   character of that action. These holy angels are evidently not all of
   the same rank. This appears from the terms by which they are
   designated; terms which imply diversity of order and authority. Some
   are princes, others potentates, others rulers of the world. Beyond this
   the Scriptures reveal nothing, and the speculations of schoolmen and
   theologians as to the hierarchy of the angelic hosts, have neither
   authority nor value.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 3. Their Employments.

   The Scriptures teach that the holy angels are employed, (1.) In the
   worship of God. (2.) In executing the will of God. (3.) And especially
   in ministering to the heirs of salvation. They are represented as
   surrounding Christ, and as ever ready to perform any service in the
   advancement of his kingdom that may be assigned tc them. Under the Old
   Testament they repeatedly appeared to the servants of God to reveal to
   them his will. They smote the Egyptians; were employed in the giving of
   the law at Mount Sinai; attended the Israelites during their journey;
   destroyed their enemies; and encamped around the people of God as a
   defence in hours of danger. They predicted and celebrated the birth of
   Christ (Matt. i. 20; Luke i. ii); they ministered to Him in his
   temptation and sufferings (Matt. iv. 11; Luke xxii. 43); and they
   announced his resurrection and ascension (Matt. xxviii. 2: John xx. 12;
   Acts i. 10, 11). They are still ministering spirits to believers (Heb.
   i. 14); they delivered Peter from prison; they watch over children
   (Matt. xviii. 10); they bear the souls of the departed to Abraham's
   bosom (Luke xvi. 22); they are to attend Christ at his second coming,
   and gather his people into his kingdom (Matt. xiii. 39; xvi. 27; xxiv.
   31). Such are the general statements of the Scriptures on this subject,
   and with these we should be content. We know that they are the
   messengers of God; that they are now and ever have been employed in
   executing his commissions, but further than this nothing is positively
   revealed. Whether each individual believer has a guardian angel is not
   declared with any clearness in the Bible. The expression used in Matt.
   xviii. 10, in reference to the little children, "whose angels" are said
   to behold the face of God in heaven, is understood by many to favour
   this assumption. So also is the passage in Acts xii. 7, where Peter's
   angel is spoken of (verse 15). This latter passage, however, no more
   proves that Peter had a guardian angel than if the servant maid had
   said it was Peter's ghost it would prove the popular superstition on
   that subject. The language recorded is not of an inspired person, but
   of an uneducated servant, and can have no didactic authority. It only
   goes to prove that the Jews of that day believed in spiritual
   apparitions. The passage in Matthew has more pertinency. It does teach
   that children have guardian angels; that is, that angels watch over
   their welfare. But it does not prove that each child, or each believer,
   has his own guardian angel. In Daniel, ch. x., mention is made of the
   Prince of Persia, the Prince of Grecia, and, speaking to the Hebrews,
   of Michael your Prince, in such a way as to lead the great majority of
   commentators and theologians in all ages of the Church to adopt the
   opinion that certain angels are intrusted with the special oversight of
   particular kingdoms. As Michael, who is called the Prince of the
   Hebrews, was not the uncreated angel of the covenant, nor a human
   prince, but an archangel, the inference seems natural that the Prince
   of Persia and the Prince of Grecia were also angels. This opinion,
   however, has been controverted on various grounds. (1.) On the silence
   of Scripture elsewhere on the subject. Neither in the Old nor in the
   New Testament do we find any intimation that the heathen nations have
   or had either a guardian angel or an evil spirit set over them. (2.) In
   verse 13 of of the tenth chapter of Daniel the powers who were arrayed
   against Michael the angel who appeared to the prophet, are called "the
   kings of Persia;" at least, according to one interpretation of that
   passage. (3.) In the following chapter earthly sovereigns are
   introduced in such a way as to show that they, and not angels good or
   bad, are the contending powers indicated by the prophet. [606] It is
   certainly unadvisabie to adopt on the authority of a doubtful passage
   in a single book of Scripture a doctrine unsupported by other parts of
   the Word of God. While this must be admitted, yet it is nevertheless
   true that the ordinary interpretation of the language of the prophet is
   altogether the most natural one; and that there is nothing in the
   doctrine thus taught out of analogy with the clear teaching of the
   Scriptures. It is plain from what is elsewhere taught that spiritual
   beings higher than man, both good and evil, do exist; that they are
   exceedingly numerous; that they are very powerful; that they have
   access to our world, and are occupied in its affairs; that they are of
   different ranks or orders; and that their names and titles indicate
   that they exercise dominion and act as rulers. This is true of evil, as
   well as of good angels; and, being true, there is nothing in the
   opinion that one particular angel should have special control over one
   nation, and another over another nation, that is in conflict with the
   analogy of Scripture.

   So far, however, as the good angels are concerned, it is clear, --

   1. That they can and do produce effects in the natural or external
   world. The Scriptures everywhere assume that matter and mind are two
   distinct substances, and that the one can act upon the other. We know
   that our minds act upon our bodies, and that our minds are acted upon
   by material causes. There is nothing, therefore, beyond even the
   teaching of experience, in the doctrine that spirits may act on the
   material world. The extent of their agency is limited by the principles
   above stated; and yet from their exalted nature the effects which they
   are able to produce may far exceed our comprehension. An angel slew all
   the first-born of the Egyptians in a single night; the thunder and
   lightning attending the giving of the law on Mount Sinai were produced
   by angelic agency. The ancient theologians, in many cases, drew from
   the admitted fact that angels do thus operate in the external world,
   the conclusion that all natural effects were produced by their agency,
   and that the stars were moved in their courses by the power of angels.
   But this is in violation of two obvious and important principles:
   First, that no cause for an effect should be assumed without evidence;
   and Second, that no more causes should be assumed than are necessary to
   account for the effect. We are not authorized, therefore, to attribute
   any event to angelic interference except on the authority of Scripture,
   nor when other causes are adequate to account for it.

   2. The angels not only execute the will of God in the natural world,
   but they also act on the minds of men. They have access to our minds
   and can influence them for good in accordance with the laws of our
   nature and in the use of appropriate means. They do not act by that
   direct operation, which is the peculiar prerogative of God and his
   Spirit, but by the suggestion of truth and guidance of thought and
   feeling, much as one man may act upon another. If the angels may
   communicate one with another, there is no reason why they may not, in
   like manner, communicate with our spirits. In the Scriptures,
   therefore, the angels are represented as not only affording general
   guidance and protection, but also as giving inward strength and
   consolation. If an angel strengthened our Lord himself after his agony
   in the garden, his people also may experience the support of angels;
   and if evil angels tempt to sin, good angels may allure to holiness.
   Certain it is that a wide influence and operation are attributed to
   them in Scripture in furthering the welfare of the children of God, and
   in protecting them from evil and defending them from their enemies. The
   use which our Lord makes of the promise, "He shall give his angels
   charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up
   in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone" (Ps. xci. 11,
   12), shows that it is not to be taken as a mere poetic form of
   promising divine protection. They watch over infants (Matt. xviii. 10);
   they aid those of mature age (Ps. xxxiv. 7), and are present with the
   dying (Luke xvi. 22).

   3. A special agency is also attributed to them as the servants of
   Carist in the advancement of his Church. As the law was given through
   their ministry, as they had charge of the theocratic people under the
   old economy, so they are spoken of as being still present in the
   assembly of the saints (1 Cor. xi. 10), and as constantly warring
   against the dragon and his angels.

   This Scriptural doctrine of the ministry of angels is full of
   consolation fbr the people of God. They may rejoice in the assurance
   that these holy beings encamp round about them; defending them day and
   night from unseen enemies and unapprehended dangers. At the same time
   they must not come between us and God. We are not to look to them nor
   to invoke their aid. They are in the hands of God and exercise his
   will; He uses them as He does the winds and the lightning (Heb. i. 7),
   and we are not to look to the instruments in the one case more than in
   the other.

   § 4. Evil Angels.

   The Scriptures inform us that certain of the angels kept not their
   first estate. They are spoken of as the angels that sinned. They are
   called evil, or unclean spirits; principalities; powers; rulers of this
   world; and spiritual wickednesses (i.e., wicked spirits) in high
   places. The most common designation given to them is daimones, or more
   commonly daimonia, which our translators unfortunately render devils.
   The Scriptures make a distinction between diabolos and daimon, which is
   not observed in the English version. In the spiritual world there is
   only one diabolos (devil), but there are many daimonia (demons). These
   evil spirits are represented as belonging to the same order of beings
   as the good angels. All the names and titles, expressive of their
   nature and powers, given to the one are also given to the others. Their
   original condition was holy. When they fell or what was the nature of
   their sin is not revealed. The general opinion is that it was pride,
   founded on 1 Tim. iii. 6. A bishop, the Apostle says, must not be "a
   novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation
   of the devil;" which is commonly understood to mean the condemnation
   which the devil incurred for the same sin. Some have conjectured that
   Satan was moved to rebel against God and to seduce our race from its
   allegiance, by the desire to rule over our globe and the race of man.
   Of this, however, there is no intimation in Scripture. His first
   appearance in the sacred history is in the character of an apostate
   angel. That there is one fallen angel exalted in rank and power above
   all his associates is clearly taught in the Bible. He is called Satan
   (the adversary), diabolos, the traducer, ho poneros, he evil one; the
   prince of the power of the air; the prince of darkness; the God of this
   world; Beelzebub; Belial the tempter; the old serpent, and the dragon.
   These, and simlar titles set him forth as the great enemy of God and
   man, the opposer of all that is good and the promoter of all that is
   evil. He is so constantly represented as a personal being, that the
   rationalistic notion that he is only a personification of evil, is
   irreconcilable with the authority of Scripture and inconsistent with
   the faith of the Church. The opinion that the doctrine of Satan was
   introduced among the Hebrews after the Exile, and from a heathen
   source, is no less contrary to the plain teachings of the Bible. He is
   represented as the tempter of our first parents, and is distinctly
   mentioned in the book of Job written long before the Babylonish
   captivity. Besides this representation of Satan in general terms as the
   enemy of God, he is specially set forth in Scripture, as the head of
   the kingdom of darkness, which embraces all evil beings. Man by his
   apostasy fell under the dominion of Satan, and his salvation consists
   in his being translated from Satan's kingdom into the kingdom of God's
   dear Son. That the daimonia who are represented as subject to Satan,
   are not the spirits of wicked men who have departed this life, as some
   have maintained, is clear. (1.) Because they are distinguished from the
   elect angels. (2.) From its being said that they kept not their first
   state (Jude 6). (3.) From the language of 2 Pet. ii 4. where it is said
   God spared not the angels that sinned. (4.) From the application to
   them of the titles "principalities" and "powers," which are appropriate
   only to beings belonging to the order of angels.

   Power and Agency of Evil Spirits.

   As to the power and agency of these evil spirits, they are represented
   as being exceedingly numerous, as everywhere efficient, as having
   access to our world, and as operating in nature and in the minds of
   men. The same limitations, of course, belong to their agency as belong
   to that of the holy angels. (1.) They are dependent on God, and can act
   only under his control and by his permission. (2.) Their operations
   must be according to the laws of nature, and, (3.) They cannot
   interfere with the freedom and responsibility of men. Augustine says of
   Satan: "Consentientes tenet, non invitos cogit." Nevertheless, his
   power is very great. Men are said to be led captive by him, evil
   spirits are said to work in the hearts of the disobedient. Christians
   are warned against their devices, and called upon to resist them, not
   in their own strength, but in the strength of the Lord and armed with
   the whole panoply of God.

   Great evils, however, have arisen from exaggerated views of the agency
   of evil spirits. To them have been referred, not only all natural
   calamities, as storms, conflagrations, pestilences, etc., but what was
   far more lamentable, they have been regarded as entering into covenant
   with men. It was thought that any person could enter into a contract
   with Satan and be invested for a season with supernatural power upon
   condition that the person thus endowed yielded his soul to perdition.
   On this foundation rested the numerous prosecutions for witchcraft and
   sorcery which disgraced the annals of all Christian nations during the
   seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The most enlightened men of
   Europe yielded themselves to this delusion, under which thousands of
   men and women, and even children, were put to the most cruel deaths. It
   is not necessary to go to the opposite extreme and deny all agency of
   evil spirits in nature or over the bodies and minds of men, in order to
   free ourselves from such evils. It is enough to adhere to the plain
   teaching of the Bible. These spirits can only act, as before stated, in
   accordance with the laws of nature and the free agency of man; and
   their influence and operations can no more be detected and judicially
   proved than the influence and operations of holy angels for good. Both
   classes are efficient; we are to be thankful to God for the unseen and
   unknowable ministry of the angels of light, and be on our guard and
   seek divine protection from the machinations of the spirits of evil.
   But of neither are we directly conscious, and to the agency of neither
   can we with certainty refer any specific effect, if its occurrence
   admits of any other explanation.

   Demoniacal Possessions.

   The most marked exhibition of the power of evil spirits over the bodies
   and minds of men, is afforded by the demoniacs so often mentioned in
   the evangelical history. These demoniacal possessions were of two
   kinds. First, those in which the soul alone was the subject of the
   diabolic influence, as in the case of the "damsel possessed with a
   spirit of divination," mentioned in Acts xvi. 16. Perhaps in some
   instances false prophets and magicians were examples of the same kind
   of possession. Secondly, those in which the bodies alone, or as was
   more frequently the case, both the body and mind were the subjects of
   this spiritual influence. By possession is meant the inhabitation of an
   evil spirit in such relation to the body and soul as to exert a
   controlling influence, producing violent agitations and great
   suffering, both mental and corporeal. That the demoniacs mentioned in
   the New Testament were not mere lunatics or the subjects of epilepsy or
   other analogous diseases, but cases of real possession, is plain,
   First, because this was the prevailing belief of the Jews at that time;
   and secondly, because Christ and his Apostles evidently adopted and
   sanctioned that belief. They not only called those thus affected
   demoniacs, but addressed the spirits as persons, commanded them,
   disposed of them, and in every way spoke and acted as they would have
   done had the popular belief been well founded. It is certain that all
   who heard Christ thus speak would and did conclude that he regarded the
   demoniacs as really possessed by evil spirits. This conclusion he
   nowhere contradicts; but on the contrary, in his most private
   conferences with the disciples abundantly confirmed. He promised to
   give them power to cast out demons; and referred to his possession of
   this power, and his ability to delegate its exercise to his disciples
   as one of the most convincing proofs of his Messiahship and divinity.
   He came to destroy the works of the devil; and that He did thus triumph
   over him and his angels, proved that He was what He claimed to be, the
   promised almighty king and conqueror, who was to found that kingdom of
   God of which there is to be no end. To explain all this on the
   principle of accommodation would destroy the authority of Scripture. On
   the same principle the doctrine of atonement, inspiration, divine
   influence, and every other distinctive doctrine of the Bible, may be,
   and has been explained away. We must take the Scriptures in their plain
   historical sense -- in that sense in which they were designed to be
   understood by those to whom they were addressed, or we do thereby
   reject them as a rule of faith.

   There is no special improbability in the doctrine of demoniacal
   possessions. Evil spirits do exist. They have access to the minds and
   bodies of men. Why should we refuse to believe, on the authority of
   Christ, that they were allowed to have special power over some men? The
   world, since the apostasy, belongs to the kingdom of Satan; and to
   redeem it from his dominion was the special object of the mission of
   the Son of God. It is not surprising, therefore, that the time of his
   advent, was Satan's hour; the time when, to a greater degree than
   before or after, he manifested his power, thus making the fact of his
   overthrow the more conspicuous and glorious.

   The objections to the common doctrine on this subject are, --

   1. That calling certain persons demoniacs no more proves that they were
   possessed by evil spirits, than calling others lunatics, proves that
   they were under the influence of the moon. This is true; and if the
   argument rested only on the use of the word demoniac, it would be
   altogether insufficient to establish the doctrine. But this is only a
   collateral and subordinate argument, without force in itself, but
   deriving force from other sources. If the sacred writers, besides
   designating the deranged as lunatics, had spoken of the moon as the
   source of their derangement, and had referred to its different phases
   as increasing or lessening the force of their mental disorder, there
   would be some analogy between the cases. It is readily admitted that
   the use of a word is often very different from its primary
   signification, and therefore that its meaning can not always be
   determined by its etymology. But when its signification is the same
   with its usage; when those called demoniacs are said to be possessed
   with evil spirits; when those spirits are addressed as persons, and
   commnanded to depart; and when this power over them is appealed to as
   proof of Christ's power over Satan, the prince of these fallen angels;
   then it is unreasonable to deny that the word is to be understood in
   its literal and proper sense.

   2. A second objection is that the phenomena exhibited by those called
   demoniacs are those of known bodily or mental diseases, and therefore
   that no other cause can rationally be assumed to account for them. It
   is not, however, true that all the phenomena in question can be thus
   accounted for. Some of the symptoms are those of lunacy and epilepsy,
   but others are of a different character. These demoniacs often
   exhibited supernatural power or knowledge. Besides this, the Scriptures
   teach that evil spirits have power to produce bodily disease. And
   therefore the presence of such disease is no proof that the agency of
   evil spirits was not active in its production and its consequences.

   3. It is further objected that such cases do not now occur. This is by
   no means certain. The evil spirits do now work in the children of
   disobedience, and for what we know they may now work in some men as
   effectually as in the ancient demoniacs. But admitting the fact to be
   as assumed, it would prove nothing to the point. There may have been
   special reasons for allowing such displays of Satanic power when Christ
   was on earth, which no longer exist. That miracles are not wrought in
   the Church now, is no proof that they were not wrought during the
   apostolic age.

   We are not to deny what are plainly recorded in the Scriptures as facts
   on this subject; we have no right to assert that Satan and his angels
   do not now in any cases produce similar effects; but we should abstain
   from asserting the fact of Satanic or demoniacal influence or
   possession in any case where the phenomena can be otherwise accounted
   for. The difference between believing whatever is possible, and
   believing only what is certain is strikingly illustrated in the case of
   Luther and Calvin. The former was disposed to refer all evil to the
   spirits of darkness; the latter referred nothing to their agency that
   could not be proved to be actually their work. Luther [607] says: "Die
   Heiden wissen nicht, woher das Unglück so plötzlich kommt; aber wir
   wissen es, dass es eitel Teufels Arbeit ist, der hat solche
   Helleparten, Bleikugeln und Büchsen, solche Spiesse und Schwerter,
   damit er unter uns schiesst, wirft und sticht, wenn Gott es ihm
   erlaubt. Darum zweifle nur Niemand dran, wo ein Feuer aufgehet, dass
   ein Dorf oder ein Haus abbrennet, da sitzt allewege ein Teufelein
   dabei, das bläset immer in das Feuer, dass es soll grosser werden."
   "Ein Christ soll das wissen, dass er mitten unter den Teufeln sitze,
   und dass ihm der Teufel näher sei denn sein Rock oder Hemde, ja näher
   denn seine eigene Haut, dass er rings um uns her sei, und wir also
   stets mit ihm zu Haare liegen und uns mit ihm schlagen müssen." [608]
   "The heathen know not whence evil so suddenly comes. But we know. It is
   the pure work of the devil; who has fire-brands, bullets, torches,
   spears, and swords, with which he shoots, casts, or pierces, when God
   permits. Therefore let no man doubt when a fire breaks out which
   consumes a village or a house, that a little devil is sitting there
   blowing the fire to make it greater." Again, "Let a Christian know that
   he sits among devils: that the devil is nearer to him than his coat or
   his shirt, or even his skin; that he is all about us, and that we must
   always grapple with and fight him." Calvin's view of tbe subject is,
   [609] "Quæ de diabolis Scriptura tradit, eo fere tendunt omnia, ut
   solliciti simus ad præcavendas corum insidias et molitiones: tum iis
   armis nos instruamus, quæ ad propulsandos potentissimos hostes satis
   firma sint ac valida." And he asks, [610] "Quid nostra refert vel
   plura, vel in alium finem de diabolis scire?"

     * "Quid est præscientia," asks Augustine, "nisi scientia futurorum?
       Quid autem futurum est Deo, qui omnia supergreditur tempora? Si
       enim scientia Dei res ipsas habet, non sunt ei futuræ, sed
       præsentes, ac per hoc non jam præscientia, sed tantum scientia
       dicipotest.": [1003]1
     * "summa indifferentia," he says, "in Deo, summum est ejus
       omnipotentiæ argumentam.": [1004]1
     * Absolute possibilia sunt, quæ nec Dei naturæ, nec aliarum rerum
       extra Deum essentiæ contradicunt.: [1005]1
     * Actio Dei, qua in causas earumque principia influendo, creaturas
       excitat, et agendum præmovet, et ad hoc potius quam ad illud
       agendum applicat. Simultaneus : [1006]1
     * Actus positivus et directus, quo Deus in genere in causas
       efficientes rerum conservandas influxu vero et reali influit, ut in
       natura, proprietatibus et viribus suis persistant ac permaneant.:
       [1007]1
     * Ad coërcenda petulantia ingenia decernit (Synodus), ut nemo, suæ
       prudentiæ innixus in rebus fidei et morum ad ædificationem doctrinæ
       Christiana pertinentium, Sacram Scripturam ad suas sensus
       contorquens contra eum sensum, quem tenuit et tenet sancta mater
       Ecclesia, cujus est judicare de vero sensu et interpretatione
       Scripturarum Sanctarum, aut etiam contra unanimem consensum patrum
       ipsam scripturam sacram interpretari audeat, etiamsi hujus modi
       interpretationes nullo unquam tempore in lucem edendæ forent. Qui
       contravenerint, per ordinarios declarentur et poenis a jure
       statutis puniantur.: [1008]1
     * Ad gubernationem concursus pertinet, quo Deus non solum dat vim
       agendi causis secundis et eam conservat, sed et easdem movet et
       applicat ad agendum. Præcursus etiam dicitur, nam causæ secundm non
       movent nisi motæ.: [1009]1
     * Ad providentiam divinam non pertinet, naturam rerum corrumpere, sed
       servare: unde omnia movet secundum eorum conditionem: ita quod ex
       causis necessariis per motionem divinam consequuntur effectus ex
       necessitate; ex causis autem contingentibus sequuntur effectus
       contingentes. Quia igitur voluntas est activum principium non
       determinatum ad unum, sed indifferenter se habens ad multa, sic
       Deus ipsam movet, quod non ex necessitate ad unum determinat, sed
       remanet motus ejus contingens et non necessarius, nisi in his ad
       quæ naturaliter movetur.: [1010]1
     * Ad quæstionem tuam, an de Deo tam claram, quam de triangulo habeam
       ideam, respondeo affirmando. Non dico, me Deum omnino cognoscere;
       sed me quædam ejus attributa, non autem omnia, neque maximam
       intelligere partem, et certum est, plurimorum ignorantiam,
       quorundam eorum habere notitiam, non impedire. Quum Euclidis
       elementa addiscerem, primo tres trianguli angulos duobus rectis
       æquari intelligebam; hancque trianguli proprietatem clare
       percipiebam, licet multarum aliarum ignarus essem.: [1011]1
     * Affectus in Deo denotat effectum.: [1012]1
     * Affirmamus ex Dei verbo, Ecclesiam esse fidelium coetum, qui in
       verbo Dei sequendo et pura religione colenda consentiunt, in qua
       etiam quotidie proficiunt.: [1013]1
     * Arianorum venenum non jam portiunculam quamdam, sed pene orbem
       totum contaminaverat, adeo ut prope cunctis Latini sermonis
       episcopis partim vi partim fraude deceptis caligo quædam mentibus
       effunderetur.: [1014]1
     * Attributa divina a parte rei et in se non multa sunt, sed ut ipsa
       essentia divina, ita et attributa, quæ cum illa identificantur,
       simplicissima unitas sunt; multa vero dicuntur (1.) sunkatabatikos:
       [1015]1
     * Attributa divina ab essentia divina et a se invicem, distinguuntur
       non nominaliter neque realiter sed formaliter, secundum nostrum
       concipiendi modum, non sine certo distinctionis fundamento.:
       [1016]1
     * Attributa divina nec rei, nec rationis distinctione, inter se aut
       ab essentia divina distingui; sed omnem distinctionem esse solum in
       nominibus.: [1017]1
     * Auctoritas siquidem ex vera ratione processit, ratio vero nequaquam
       ex auctoritate. Omnis autem auctoritas, quæ vera ratione non
       approbatur, infirma videtur esse. Vera autem ratio, quum virtutibus
       suis rata atque immutabilis munitur, nullius auctoritatis
       adstipulatione roborari indiget.: [1018]1
     * Beatitudo non est virtutis præmium, sed ipsa virtus.: [1019]1
     * Bechaí : [1020]1
     * Cogita frequens illud yhy: [1021]1
     * Cogito ergo sum: [1022]1 [1023]2
     * Cognitio æternæ et infinitæ essentiæ Dei, quam unaquæque idea
       involvit, est adæquata et perfecta.: [1024]1
     * Concurrit Deus cum naturalibus ad modum causæ naturalis, cum causis
       liberis per modum causæ liberæ.: [1025]1

       conversimque veram religionem esse veram philosophiam.: [1030]1
     * Congregatio sanctorum et vere credentium.: [1031]1
     * Congregatio sanctorum, qui habent inter se societatem ejusdem
       evangelii seu doctrinæ, et ejusdem Spiritus Sancti, qui corda eorum
       renovat, sanctificat et gubernat: [1032]1
     * Congregatio sanctorum.: [1033]1
     * Consentientes tenet, non invitos cogit.: [1034]1
     * Conservatio continuata creatio Dei activa est. Si enim creatio et
       conservatio duæ actiones distinctæ forent, creatio primo cessaret,
       ac tum conservatio vel eodem, quo creatio cessavit, vel sequenti
       momento inciperet.: [1035]1
     * Conservatio est quædam continuatio. Quemadmodum creatio est prima
       productio rei ex nihilo, ita est conservatio rei continuatio, ne in
       nihilum recidat. Deus mundum sustinet.: [1036]1
     * Conservationi annihilatio opponitur. Cessante actione conservante
       res in nihilum collabitur.: [1037]1
     * Constat causas secundas non rite causas vocari. . . . . Essentiam,
       virtutem, et operationem habent non suam sed numinis. Instrumenta
       igitur sunt.: [1038]1
     * Corpus ac societas fidelium, quos Deus ad vitam æternam
       prædestinavit.: [1039]1
     * Credimus et confitemur unicam Ecclesiam catholicam seu universalem,
       quæ est sancta congregatio seu coetus omnium fidelium
       Christianorum, qui totam suam salutem ab uno Jesu Christo
       exspectant, abluti ipsius sanguine et per Spiritum ejus
       sanctificati atque obsignati. Hæc Ecclesia sancta nullo est aut
       certo loco sita et circumscripta, aut ullis certis personis
       astricta aut alligata: sed per omnem orbem terrarum sparsa atque
       diffusa est.: [1040]1
     * Credimus, confitemur et docemus, unicam regulam et normam secundum
       quam omnia dogmata omnesque doctores æstimari et judicari oporteat,
       nullam omnino aliam esse, quam prophetica et apostolica scripta cum
       V. tum N. Testamenti.: [1041]1
     * Cum actus qua talis semper bonus sit quoad entitatem suam, Deus ad
       illum concurrit effective, et physice. . . . . (quoad malitiam)
       Deus nec causa physica potest ejus dici, quia nec illam inspirat
       aut infundit, nec facit; nec ethica, qui nec imperat, aut approbat
       et suadet, sed severissime prohibet et punit.: [1042]1
     * Cum igitur dicitur, Deus est bonus; non est sensus, Deus est causa
       bonitatis; vel Deus non est malus. Sed est sensus: Id, quod
       bonitatem dicimus in creaturis, præexistit in Deo; et hoc quidem
       secundum modum altiorem. Unde ex hoc non sequitur, quod Deo
       competat esse bonum, in quantum causat bonitatem; sed potius e
       converso, quia est bonus, bonitatem rebus diffundit.: [1043]1
     * Cum providentia non concurrat cum voluntate humana, vel per :
       [1044]1
     * Demones possunt facere miracula: quæ scilicet homines mirantur, in
       quantum eorum facultatem et cognitionem excedunt.: [1045]1
     * Deum esse ens summe perfectum concedunt omnes. Entis autem summe
       perfecti Idea est ut sit substantia una, simplex, indivisibilis,
       viva et vivifica, ubique semper necessario existens, summe
       intelligens omnia, libere volens bona, voluntate efficiens
       possibilia, effectibus nobilioribus similitudinem propriam quantum
       fieri potest, communicans, omnia in se continens, tanquam eorum
       principium et locus, omnia per præsentiam substantialem cernens et
       regens, et cum rebus omnibus, secundum leges accuratas ut naturæ
       totius fundamentum et causa constanter coöperans, nisi ubi aliter
       agere bonum est.: [1046]1
     * Deum non solum inclinare voluntates malas ad unum potius, quam ad
       aliud permittendo, ut ferantur in unum, et non permittendo, ut
       ferantur in aliud, ut Hugo recte docuit, sed etiam positive
       inclinando in unum et avertendo ab alio.: [1047]1
     * Deum nullo modo fato subjicio, sed omnia inevitabili necessitate ex
       Dei natura sequi concipio.: [1048]1
     * Deus "est in omnibus per potentiam, in quantum omnia ejus potestati
       subduntur; est per præsentiam in omnibus, in quantum omnia nuda
       sunt et aperta oculis ejus. Est in omnibus per essentiam in quantum
       adest omnibus ut causa essendi sicut dictum est.": [1049]1
     * Deus "immediate influit in actionem et effectum creaturæ, ita ut
       idem effectus non a solo Deo, nec a sola creatura, nec partim a
       Deo, partim a creatura, sed una eademque efficientia totali simul a
       Deo et creatura producatur, a Deo videlicet ut causa universali et
       prima, a creatura ut particulari et secunda.": [1050]1
     * Deus "non voluit tres angulos trianguli æquales esse duobus rectis,
       quia cognovit aliter fieri non posse. Sed contra . . . . quia
       voluit tres angulos trianguli necessario æquales esse duobus
       rectis, idcirco jam hoc verum est, et fieri aliter non potest,
       atque ita de reliquis.": [1051]1
     * Deus est essentia omnium creaturarum et esse omnium: [1052]1
     * Deus est essentia spiritualis infinita: [1053]1
     * Deus est ipsum esse subsistens, omnibus modis indeterminatum.:
       [1054]1
     * Deus est unus re et plures ratione, quia intellectus noster ita
       multipliciter apprehendit Deum, sicuti res multipliciter ipsum
       representant.: [1055]1
     * Deus est, Natura necessaria, a mundo diversa, summas complexa
       perfectiones et ipsius mundi causa: [1056]1
     * Deus ex machina.: [1057]1
     * Deus non potest facere aliquid præter ea quæ facit: [1058]1
     * Deus non solum permittit impios agere multa mala, nec solum deserit
       pios ut cogantur pati quæ ab impiis inferuntur; sed etiam præsidet
       ipsis voluntatibus malis, easque regit et gubernat, torquet ac
       flectit in eis invisibiliter operando, ut licet vitio proprio malæ
       sint, tamen a divina providentia ad unum potius malum, quam ad
       aliud, non positive sed permissive ordinentur.: [1059]1
     * Deus omnipotens, quia potest quæ vult, quæque ejus veritati,
       justitiæ conveniunt.: [1060]1
     * Deus per intellectum suum causat res, cum suum esse sit suum
       intelligere.: [1061]1
     * Deus per intellectum suum causat res, cum suum esse sit suum
       intelligere. Unde necesse est, quod sua scientia sit causa rerum.:
       [1062]1
     * Dicente seu jubente Deo: [1063]1
     * Dicunt nonnulli, ideo Deum dici justum, sanctum, misericordem,
       veracem, etc., non quod revera sit talis, sed quod duntaxat
       sanctitatis, justitiæ, misericordiæ, veritatis, etc., causa sit et
       auctor in aliis. Sed si Deus non est vere misericors, neque vere
       perfectus, vere sanctus, etc., sed causa tantum misericordiæ et
       sanctitatis in aliis, ita etiam et nos pariter juberemur esse non
       vere misericordes, non vere perfecti, etc., sed sanctitatis saltem
       et misericordiæ in aliis auctores.: [1064]1
     * Distingue inter revelationem et inspirationem. Revelatio vi vocis
       est manifestatio rerum ignotarum et occultarum, et potest fieri
       multis et diversis modis. . . . . Inspiratio . . . . est interna
       conceptum suggestio, seu infusio, sive res conceptæ jam ante
       scriptori fuerint cognitæ, sive occultæ. Illa potuit tempore
       antecedere scriptionem, hæc cum scriptione semper fuit conjuncta et
       in ipsam scriptionem influebat.: [1065]1
     * Distinguendum inter effectum et defectum, inter actionem et
       actionis ataxian: [1066]1
     * Divinæ dicuntur quæ acceptæ sunt ab ipso Christo apostolos docente,
       et nusquam in divinis literis in veniuntur. . . . . Apostolicæ
       traditiones proprie dicuntur illæ, quæ ab apostolis institutæ sunt,
       non tamen sine assistentia Spiritus Sancti et nihilominus non
       extant scriptæ in eorum epistolis. . . . . Ecclesiasticæ
       traditiones proprie dicuntur consuetudines quædam antiquæ vel a
       prælatis vel a populis inchoatæ, quæ paulatim tacito consensu
       populorum vim legis obtinuerunt. Et quidem traditiones divinæ
       eandem vim habent, quam divinae præcepta sive divina doctrina
       scripta in Evangeliis. Et similiter apostolicæ traditiones non
       scriptæ eandem vim habent, quam apostolica, traditiones scriptæ. .
       . . . Ecclesiasticæ autem traditiones eandem vim habent, quam
       decreta et constitutiones ecclesiasticæ, scriptæ.: [1067]1

     * Dominus possidet me: [1070]1
     * Duo sunt causarum genera, aliæ definitæ et generales, quæ eodem
       modo semper agunt, ut ignis qui urit, sol qui lucet; aliæ
       indefinitæ et liberæ, quæ possunt agere vel non agere, hoc vel illo
       modo agere: ita Deus naturam earum conservat, et cum illis juxta
       eam in agendo concurrit; cum definitis, ut ipse eas determinet sine
       determinatione propria; cum indefinitis vero et liberis, ut ipsæ
       quoque se determinent proprio rationis judicio, et libera
       voluntatis dispositione, quam Deus non aufert homini, quia sic opus
       suum destrueret, sed relinquit et confirmat.: [1071]1
     * Ea res libera dicetur, quæ ex sola suæ naturæ necessitate existit
       et a se sola ad agendum determinatur. Necessaria autem, vel potius
       coacta quæ ab alio determinatur ad existendum et operandum certa ac
       determinata ratione.: [1072]1
     * Ecclesia manet et manebit.: [1073]1
     * Ecclesia non parietibus consistit, sed in dogmatum veritate,
       Ecclesia ibi est ubi fides vera est. Ceterum ante annos quindecim
       aut viginti parietes omnes hic ecclesiarum hæretici (Ariani)
       possidebant, Ecclesia autem vera illic erat, ubi vera fides erat.:

     * Ego cogito, ergo sum, sive existo,' existentiam ex cogitatione per
       syllogismum deducit, sed tanquam rem per se notam simplici mentis

     * Esse Deos, quoniam insitas eorum, vel potius innatas cognitiones
       habemus.: [1080]1
     * Est Deus ubique illocaliter, impartibiliter, efficaciter; non
       definitive ut spiritus, non circumscriptive ut corpora, sed
       repletive citra sui multiplicationem, extensionem, divisionem,
       inclusionem, aut commixtionem more modoque divino
       incomprehensibili.: [1081]1

       definire volumus, brevis et circumscripta quædam explicatio.:
       [1082]1
     * Est quædam imago Trinitatis, ipsa mens, et notitia ejus, quod est
       proles ejus ac de seipsa verbum ejus, et amor tertius, et hæc tria
       unum atque una substantia.: [1083]1
     * Et certe id, quo majus cogitari nequit, non potest esse in
       intellectu solo. Si enim vel in solo intellectu est, potest

       arrogantiam, immodicæ legis naturalis admirationi junctam,
       compescant, miracula haud temere essent edita.: [1087]1
     * Ex his -- sequitur, nomen miraculi non nisi respective ad hominum
       opiniones posse intelligi, et nihil aliud significare quam opus,
       cujus causam naturalem exemplo alterius rei solitæ explicare non

     * Filius dicitur imago et logos: [1093]1
     * Filius non hoc tantum habet nascendo, ut Filius sit, sed omnino ut
       sit. . . . . Filius non tantum ut sit Filius, quod relative
       dicitur, sed omnino ut sit, ipsam substantiam nascendo habet.:

     * Fuisse et futurum esse non est in ea [scil. vita divina: [1095]1
     * Hæc -- tria, memoria, intelligentia, voluntas, quoniam non sunt
       tres vitæ, sed una vita; nec tres mentes, sed una mens:
       consequenter utique nec tres substantiæ sunt, sed una substantia.:
       [1096]1
     * Hæc cernitur (a: [1097]1
     * Habemus ideam Dei, hujusque ideæ realitas objectiva nec formaliter
       nec eminenter in nobis continetur, nec in ullo alio præterquam in
       ipso Deo potest contineri; ergo hæc idea Dei, quæ in nobis est,
       requirit Deum pro causa; Deusque proinde existit.: [1098]1
     * Habet mens rationalis, quum se cogitando intelligit, secum imaginem
       suam ex se natam, id est cogitationem sui ad suam similitudinem,
       quasi sua impressione formatam, quamvis ipsa se a sua imagine, non
       nisi ratione sola, separare possit, quæ imago ejus verbum ejus est.
       Hoc itaque modo, quis neget, summam sapientem, quum se dicendo
       intelligit, gignere consubstantialem sibi similitudinem suam, id
       est Verbum suum.: [1099]1
     * Hic Spiritus Sanctus ab ipso mundi initio aquis legitur superfusus;
       non materialibus aquis quasi vehiculo egens, quas potius ipse
       ferebat et complectentibus firmamentum dabat con gruum motum et
       limitem præfinitum. . . . [Hic est] spiritus vitæ cujus vivificus
       calor animat omnia et fovet et provehit et foecundat. Hic Spiritus
       Sanctus omnium viventium anima, ita largitate sua se omnibus
       abundanter infundit, ut habeant omnia rationabilia et
       irrationabilia secundum genus suum ex eo quod sunt et quod in suo
       ordine suæ naturæ competentia agunt. Non quod ipse sit
       substantialis anima singulis, sed in se singulariter manens, de
       plenitudine sua distributor magnificus proprias efficientias
       singulis dividit et largitur; et quasi sol omnia calefaciens,
       subjecta omnia nutrit, et absque ulla sui diminutione, integritatem
       suam de inexhausta abundantia, quod satis est, et sufficit omnibus,
       commodat et impartit.: [1100]1
     * Hinc sequitur mentem humanam partem esse infiniti intellectus Dei:

     * Homo est notio quædam intellectualis in mente divina æternaliter
       facta. Verissima et probatissima definitio hominis est ista: et non
       solum hominis, verum etiam omnium quæ in divina sapientia facta
       sunt.: [1103]1
     * Id ipsum etiam nomine Prædeterminationis, seu Præmotionis solet
       designari, qua Deus ciet et applicat causam secundam ad agendum,
       adeoque antecedenter ad omnem operationem creaturæ, seu prius
       natura et ratione quam creatura operetur, eam realiter et
       efficaciter movet ad agendum in singulis actionibus, adeo ut sine
       hac præmotione causa secunda operari non possit, ea vero posita
       impossibile sit in sensu composito causam secundam non illud idem
       agere ad quod a prima causa præmovetur.: [1104]1
     * In æternitate est unicum instans semper præsens et persistens:
       [1105]1
     * In Deo idem est esse et intelligere et velle.: [1106]1
     * In mente nulla est absoluta sive libera voluntas. Mens certus et
       determinatus modus cogitandi est adeoque suarum actionum non potest
       esse causa libera.: [1107]1
     * In scriptura sancta habet unversalis Christi Ecclesia plenissime
       exposita, quæcunque pertinent cum ad salvificam fidem, tum ad vitam
       Deo placentem.C. ii. p. 479, ibid: [1108]1
     * Infallibilis est regula et catholica. Quacunque credit, tenet, et
       servat Romana Ecclesia, et in Scripturis non habentur, illa ab
       apostolis esse tradita; item quarum observationum initium, author
       et origo ignoretur, vel inveniri non potest, illas extra omnem
       dubitationem ab apostolis tradita esse.: [1109]1
     * Ingemuit totus orbis terrarum, et Arianum se esse miratus est.:
       [1110]1
     * Intellectus enim omnium in Deo essentia omnium est. Siquidem id
       ipsum est Deo cognoscere, priusquam fiunt, quæ facit, et facere,
       quæ cognoscit. Cognoscere ergo et facere Dei unum est.: [1111]1
     * Intellectus enim rerum veraciter ipsæ res sunt, dicente Sancto
       Dionysio, Cognitio eorum, quæ sunt, ea, quæ sunt, est.': [1112]1
     * Intellectus et voluntas, qui Dei essentiam constituerent, a nostro
       intellectu et voluntate toto coelo differe deberent, nec in ulla
       re, præterquam in nomine, convenire possent; non aliter scilicet,
       quam inter se conveniunt canis, signum coeleste, et canis, animal
       latrans.: [1113]1
     * Ipse Deus enim fons nostræ beatudinis, ipse omnis appetitionis est
       finis. Hunc eligentes vel potius religentes amiseramus enim
       negligentes: hunc ergo religentes, unde et religio dicta
       perhibetur, ad eum dilectione tendimus ut perveniendo quiescamus.:
       [1114]1
     * Justitia erga Deos religio, erga parentas pietas, creditis in rebus
       fides, in moderatione animadvertendi lenitas, amicitia in
       benevolentia nominatur.: [1115]1
     * Leges naturæ universales," he says, "mera esse decreta Dei, quæ ex
       necessitate et perfectione naturæ divinæ sequuntur. Si quid igitur
       in natura contingeret, quod ejus universalibus legibus repugnaret,
       id decreto et intellectui et naturæ divinæ necessario etiam
       repugnaret; aut si quis statueret, Deum aliquid contra leges naturæ
       agere, is simul etiam cogeretur statuere, Deum contra suam naturam
       agere, quo nihil absurdius.: [1116]1
     * Licet Filius sit a Patre, non minus tamen autotheos: [1117]1
     * Longe vero tutius est in ea quam tradit relatione subsistere, quam
       subtilius penetrando ad sublime mysterium, per multas evanidas
       speculationes evagari. Ergo quibus cordi erit sobrietas et qui
       fidei mensura contenti erunt, breviter quod utile est cognitu
       accipiant: nempe quum profitemur nos credere in unum Deum, sub Dei
       nomine intelligi unicam et simplicem essentiam, in qua
       comprehendimus tres personas vel hypostaseis: ideoque quoties Dei
       nomen indefinite ponitur, non minus Filium et Spiritum, quam Patrem
       designari: ubi autem adjungitur Filius Patri, tunc in medium venit
       relatio: atque ita distinguimus inter personas. Quia vero
       proprietates in personis ordinem secum ferunt, ut in Patre sit
       principium et origo: quoties mentio sit Patris et Filii simul, vel
       Spiritus, nomen Dei peculiariter Patri tribuitur. Hoc modo
       retinetur unitas essentiæ et habetur ratio ordinis, quæ tamen ex
       Filii et Spiritus deitate nihil minuit: et certe quum ante visum
       fuerit Apostolos asserere Filium Dei illum esse, quem Moses et
       Prophetæ testati sunt esse Jehovam, semper ad unitatem essentiæ,
       venire necesse est.: [1118]1
     * Malorum opera quoque decernit et regit. Tamen non est autor mali,
       quia mali sic aguntur a Deo, ut sponte, libere et sine coactione et
       impulsu violento agant. Deinde non infundit malitiam sicut
       bonitatem, nec impellit aut allicit ad peccandum.: [1119]1
     * Maximus ait: Quodcunque intellectus comprehendere potuerit, id
       ipsum fit.: [1120]1
     * Mens igitur quando cogitatione se conspicit, intelligit se et
       recognoscit: gignit ergo hunc intellectum et cognitionem
       suam. . . . . Hæc autem duo, gignens et genitum, dilectione tertia
       copulantur, quæ nihil est aliud quam voluntas fruendum aliquid
       appetens vel tenens.: [1121]1
     * Minime Deus cogitandus est tanquam pendens ex lege ethica vel eidem
       subjectus tanquam potestati cuidam alienæ, sed Deus sanctus ipsa ea
       lex est, natura quidam hypostatica indutus.: [1122]1
     * Miracula non debent præferri doctrinæ. . . . neque enim contra
       doctrinam a Deo revelatam ulla miracula valere debent.: [1123]1
     * Miracula, si non habeant doctrinæ veritatem conjunctam nihil
       probant.: [1124]1
     * Modus Deum colendi: [1125]1
     * Moveri voluntarie est moveri ex se, id est, a principio intrinseco.
       Sed illud principium intrinsecum potest esse ab alio principio
       extrinseco. Et sic moveri ex se, non repugnat ei, quod movetur ab
       alio. -- Illud quod movetur ab altero, dicitur cogi, si moveatur
       contra inclinationem propriam: sed si moveatur ab alio quod sibi
       dat propriam inclinationem, non dicitur cogi. Sic igitur Deus
       movendo voluntatem, non cogit ipsam: quia dat ei ejus propriam
       inclinationem.: [1126]1
     * Mysticismus est persuasio de singulari animæ facultate ad
       immediatum ipsoque sensu percipiendum cum numine aut naturis
       coelestibus commercium jam in hac vita perveniendi, quo mens
       immediate cognitione rerum divinarum ac beatitate perfruatur.:
       [1127]1
     * Nam Christianus per fidem debet ad intellectum proficere, non per
       intellectum ad fidem accedere, aut si intelligere non valet, a fide
       recedere. Sed cum ad intellectum valet pertingere, delectatur, cum
       vero nequit, quod capere non potest, veneratur.: [1128]1
     * Nam si perpaucos exceperis, . . . . omnes (pastores) tempori
       obsecuti sunt: hoc tantum inter eos discriminis fuit, quod alii
       citius, alii seriùs in eam fraudem inciderunt, atque, alii
       impietatis duces antistitesque se præbuerunt.: [1129]1
     * Natura, non artificiosa solum, sed plane artifex ab eodem Zenone
       dicitur; consultrix, et provida utilitatum opportunitatumque
       omnium. Censet [Zeno] enim artis maxime proprium est creare et
       gignere, quodque in operibus nostrarum artium manus officiet id
       multo artificiosius naturam officere.: [1130]1
     * Nec tu tempore tempora præcedis, alioquin non omnia tempora
       præcederes sed præcedis omnia præterita celsitudine semper
       præsentis æternitatis; et superas omnia futura, quia illa futura
       sunt et cum venerint præterita erunt; tu autem idem ipse es, et
       anni tui non deficiunt.: [1131]1
     * Neque enim quæro intelligere, ut credam, sed credo, ut intelligam.
       Nam et hoc credo, quia, nisi credidero, non intelligam.: [1132]1
     * Nil credi posse, quod a ratione capi et intelligi nequeat.: [1133]1
     * Non adorabis ea neque coles.: [1134]1
     * Non aliud Deo esse et velle et facere: [1135]1
     * Non aliud est Deo esse et facere, sed ei esse id ipsum est et
       facere. Coæternum igitur est Deo suum facere et coessentiale.:
       [1136]1
     * Non aliud est ei videre, aliud facere; sed visio illius voluntas
       ejus est, et voluntas operatio.: [1137]1
     * Non est re ipsa alia actio influxus Dei, alia operatio creaturæ,
       sed una et indivsibilis actio, utrumque respiciens et ab utroque
       pendens, a Deo ut causa universali, a creatura ut particulari.:
       [1138]1
     * Non ignorabat Deus multas in Ecclesia exorituras difficultates
       circa fidem, debuit igitur judicem aliquem Ecclesiæ providere. At
       iste judex non potest esse Scriptura, neque Spiritus revelans
       privatus, neque princeps secularis, igitur princeps ecclesiasticus
       vel solus vel certe cum consilio et consensu coepiscoporum.:
       [1139]1
     * Non invenies in Deo aliquid mutabilitatis; non aliquid, quod aliter
       nunc sit, aliter paulo ante fuerit. Nam ubi invenis aliter et
       aliter, facta est ibi quædam mors: mors enim est, non esse quod
       fuit.: [1140]1
     * Nos asserimus, in Scripturis non contineri expressè totam doctrinam
       necessariam, sive de fide sive de moribus; et proinde praeter
       verbum Dei scriptum requiri etiam verbum Dei non-scriptum, i.e., :
       [1141]1
     * Nos ista, quæ fecisti videmus quia sunt: tu autem quia vides ea,
       sunt.: [1142]1
     * Nos ista, quæ fecisti videmus, quia sunt: tu autem quia vides ea,
       sunt.: [1143]1
     * Nostra sententia est Ecclesiam absolute non posse errare nec in
       rebus absolute necessariis nec in aliis, quæ credenda vel facienda
       nobis proponit, sive habeantur expresse in Scripturis, sive non.:
       [1144]1
     * Notio justititæ resolvitur in notionem sapientiæ et bonitatis.:
       [1145]1
     * Nulla insufficientia est Deo attribuenda. Si igitur Deus operatur
       in omni operante, sufficienter in quolibet operatur. Superfluum
       igitur esset quod agens creatum, aliquid operaretur.: [1146]1
     * Num negabis creatorem et creaturam unum esse?: [1147]1
     * Omne hoc justitiæ opus procuratio bonitatis est.: [1148]1
     * Omnes (mentes)," says Spinoza, "simul Dei æternum et infinitum
       intellectum constituunt.: [1149]1
     * Omnis doctrinæ ratio, quæ fidelibus tradenda sit, verbo Dei
       continetur, quod in scripturam traditionesque distributum est.:
       [1150]1
     * Omnis virtus: [1151]1
     * Omnis visibilis et invisibilis creatura Theophania, i.e., : [1152]1
     * Oportet semper fuisse, nunc esse et ad finem usque seculi futuram
       esse Ecclesiam, i.e., : [1153]1
     * Pantheismus [est] ea sententia, qua mundum non secretum a numine ac
       disparatum, sed: [1154]1
     * Pater de nullo patre, Filius de Deo Patre. Pater quod est, a nullo
       est: quod autem Pater est, propter Filium est. Filius vero et quod
       Filius est, propter Patrem est, et quod est, a Patre est.: [1155]1
     * Per Dei directionem intelligo fixum illum et immutabilem naturæ
       ordinem, sive rerum naturalium concatenationem. -- Sive igitur
       dicamus, omnia secundum leges naturæ fieri, sive ex Dei decreto et
       directione ordinari, idem dicimus.: [1156]1
     * Perpetua essentiæ divinæ et omnium ejus perfectionum identitas,
       negans omnem omnino motum cum physicum, tum ethicum.: [1157]1
     * Persona bene dicitur generare Personam, quia actiones sunt
       suppositorum; sed non Essentia Essentiam, quia quod gignit et
       gignitur necessario multiplicatur, et sic via sterneretur ad
       Tritheismum. Essentia quidem generando communicatur; sed generatio,
       ut a Persona fit originaliter, ita ad Personam terminatur.: [1158]1
     * Peto, nate, ut aspicias ad coelum, et terram, et ad omnia, quæ in
       eis sunt; et intelligas, quia ex nihilo fecit illa Deus, et hominum
       genus.: [1159]1
     * Philosophia est scientia rerum per causas primas, recto rationis
       usu comparata.: [1160]1
     * Populus spiritualis, non civilibus ritibus distinctus a gentibus,
       sed verus populus Dei renatus per Spiritum Sanctum.: [1161]1
     * Potentia Absoluta: [1162]1 [1163]2
     * Potentia Ordinata: [1164]1 [1165]2
     * Potest quod vult: [1166]1
     * Potestas variandi actus suos, non est principium mutabilitatis in
       se, sed tantum in objectis suis; nisi intelligatur de variatione
       internorum suorum actuum, : [1167]1
     * Professio veræ fidei, sacramentorum communio, et subjectio ad
       legitimum pastorem, Romanum Pontificem. -- Atque hoc interest inter
       sententiam nostram et alias omnes, quod omnes aliæ requirunt
       internas virtutes ad constituendum aliquem in Ecclesia, et
       propterea Ecclesiam veram invisibilem faciunt; nos autem credimus
       in Ecclesia inveniri omnes virtutes, -- tamen ut aliquis aliquo
       modo dici possit pars veræ Ecclesiæ, -- non putamus requiri ullam
       internam virtutem, sed tantum externam professionem fidei, et
       sacramentorum communionem, quæ sensu ipso percipitur. Ecclesia enim
       est coetus hominum ita visibilis et palpabilis, ut est coetus
       Populi Romani, vel regnum Galliæ aut respublica Venetorum.: [1168]1
     * Providentia bene altera creatio, dicitur. Nam eadem voluntate, qua
       Deus omnia creavit, omnia conservat, et creatio a conservatione in
       eo tantum differt, quod quando voluntatem Dei sequitur rerum
       existentia, dicitur creatio; quando res eadem per eandem voluntatem
       durat, dicitur conservatio.: [1169]1
     * Quæ de diabolis Scriptura tradit, eo fere tendunt omnia, ut
       solliciti simus ad præcavendas corum insidias et molitiones: tum
       iis armis nos instruamus, quæ ad propulsandos potentissimos hostes
       satis firma sint ac valida.: [1170]1
     * Quæ nunc ecclesia libere Christum adorat? Si quidem ea, si pia est,
       periculo subjacet? . . . . Nam si alicubi pii et Christi studiosi
       (sunt autem ubique tales permulti) illi itidem, ut Prophetæ et
       magnus ille Elias, absconduntur, . . . . et in speluncas et
       cavernas terræ sese abstrudunt, aut in solitudine aberrantes
       commorantur.: [1171]1
     * Quæcunque credit, tenet et servat Romana ecclesia, et in Scripturis
       non habentur illa ab Apostolis esse tradita.: [1172]1
     * Qualis homo, talis Deus.: [1173]1
     * Quando Deus ejusmodi malum triste ex peccato necessario se quens
       creaturæ accidere sinit, . . . . dicitur peccatorem punire, et hoc
       sensu ipsi tribuitur justitia vindicativa. In justitia punitiva
       bonitas cum sapientia administratur.: [1174]1
     * Quemadmodum hæc una Ecclesia errare non potest in fidei ac morum
       disciplina tradenda, cum a Spiritu Sancto gubernetur; ita ceteras
       omnes, quæ sibi ecclesiæ nomen arrogant, ut quæ Diaboli spiritu
       ducantur, in doctrinæ et morum perniciosissimis erroribus versari
       necesse est.: [1175]1
     * Qui secundum carnem vivit, carnalis sive animalis est, de quo
       dicitur: animalis homo non percipit ea, quæ sunt Spiritus Dei. . .
       . . Qui non crediderit, non intelliget, nam qui non crediderit, non
       experietur, et qui expertus non fuerit, non intelliget.: [1176]1
     * Quibus verbis nihil durius apud nostros occurrit.: [1177]1
     * Quicquid est entitatis et actionis in actione mala, reducitur in
       Deum sicut in causam: sed quod est ibi defectus non causatur a Deo,
       sed ex causa secunda deficiente.: [1178]1
     * Quid ante faciebat Deus," he asks, "quam mundus inciperet? Otiosam
       enim et immobilem dicere naturam Dei, impium est simul et absurdum,
       vel putare, quod bonitas aliquando bene non fecerit, et
       omnipotentia aliquando non egerit potentatum. Hoc nobis objicere
       solent dicentibus mundum hunc ex certo tempore coepisse, et
       secundum scripturæ fidem annos quoque ætatis ipsius
       numerantibus. . . . . Nos vero consequenter respondimus observantes
       regulam pietatis, quoniam non tunc primum cum visibilem istum
       mundum fecit Deus, coepit operari, sed sicut post corruptionem
       hujus erit alius mundus, ita et antequam hic esset, fuisse alios
       credimus.: [1179]1
     * Quid est Ecclesia?: [1180]1
     * Quid nostra refert vel plura, vel in alium finem de diabolis
       scire?: [1181]1
     * Quo magis unusquisque -- suum esse conservare conatur et potest, eo
       magis virtute præditus est; contra quatenus unusquisque -- suum
       esse conservare negligit, eatenus est impotens.: [1182]1
     * Quod Deum operari in quolibet operante, aliqui sic intellexerunt,
       quod nulla virtus creata aliquid operaretur in rebus, sed solus
       Deus immediate omnia operaretur: puta quod ignis non calefaceret,
       sed Deus in igne. Et similiter de omnibus aliis.: [1183]1
     * Quod autem res ex nihilo conditæ sint, docet hæc sententia: ipse
       dixit et facta sunt; ipse mandavit, et creata sunt, id est dicente
       seu jubente Deo, res exortæ sunt: non igitur ex materia priore
       exstructæ sunt, sed Deo dicente, cum res non essent, esse
       coeperunt; et cum Joannes in quit: Omnia per ipsum facta esse,
       refutat Stoicam imaginationem, quæ fingit materiam non esse
       factam.: [1184]1
     * Quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus: [1185]1
     * Quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus.: [1186]1
     * Quomodo est contra naturam, quod Dei fit voluntate cum voluntas
       tanti utique conditoris conditæ rei cujusque natura sit? Portentum
       ergo fit, non contra naturam, sed contra quam est nota natura.:
       [1187]1
     * Quum hæc (SS.) sit omnis veritatis summa, complectens quidquid ad
       cultum Dei et salutem nostram requiritur, neque hominibus neque
       ipsis etiam angelis fas esse dicimus quicquam ei verbo adjicere vel
       detrahere vel quicquam prorsus in eo immutare.: [1188]1
     * Regula quidem fidei una omnino est, sola immobilis et
       irreformabilis. . . . . Hac lege fidei manente, cetera jam
       disciplinæ et conversationis admittunt novitatem correctionis;
       operante scilicet et proficiente usque in finem gratia Dei. . . . .
       Propterea Paracletum misit Dominus, ut, quoniam humana mediocritas
       omnia semel capere non poterat, paulatim dirigeretur et ordinaretur
       et ad perfectum perduceretur disciplina ab illo vicario Domini
       Spiritu Sancto. Quæ est ergo Paracleti administratio nisi hæc, quod
       disciplina dirigitur, quod Scripturæ revelantur, quod intellectus
       reformatur, quod ad meliora proficitur? . . . . Justitia primo fuit
       in rudimentis, natura Deum metuens; dehinc per legem et prophetas
       promovit in infantiam; dehinc per evangelium efferbuit in
       juventutem; nunc per Paracletum componitur in maturitatem.: [1189]1
     * Religens: [1190]1
     * Religentem esse oportet, religiosum nefas.: [1191]1
     * Religio: [1192]1
     * Religiosus: [1193]1
     * Rerum divinarum et humanarum, causarumque quibus hæ res
       continentur, scientia.: [1194]1
     * Scientia (Dei) causat res; nostra vero causatur rebus et dependat
       ab eis.: [1195]1
     * Scientia Media: [1196]1 [1197]2
     * Sciri potest, Deum esse infinitum et omnipotentem, quanquam anima
       nostra, utpote finita, id nequeat comprehendere sive concipere;
       eodem nimirum modo, quo montem manibus tangere possumus, sed non ut
       arborem, aut aliam quampiam rem brachiis nostris non majorem
       amplecti: comprehendere enim est cogitatione complecti; ad hoc
       autem, ut sciamus aliquid, sufficit, ut illud cogitatione
       attingamus.: [1198]1
     * Sed in solo coelo totus, et in sola terra totus, et in coelo et in
       terra totus, et nullo contentus loco, sed in seipso ubique totus.:
       [1199]1
     * Si essentia Dei sic immensa est, tum intelligi non potest quomodo
       et ubi aliqua creata essentia esse possit. Essentia enim creata non
       est essentia divina; ergo aut est extra essentiam divinam, aut, si
       non est extra eam, est ipsa essentia illa, et sic omnia sunt Deus
       et divina essentia.: [1200]1
     * Si literæ sacræ maximeque veraces ita dicunt, in principio fecisse
       Deum coelum et terram, ut nihil antea fecisse intelligatur, quia
       hoc potius in principio fecisse diceretur, si quid fecisset ante
       coetera cuncta quæ fecit; procul dubio non est mundus factus in
       tempore, sed cum tempore.: [1201]1
     * Si proprie et accurate loqui velimus, Deus nullas habet
       proprietates, sed mera et simplicissima est essentia quæ nec realem
       differentiam nec ullam vel rerum vel modorum admittit
       compositionem. Quia vero simplicissimam Dei essentiam uno adequato
       conceptu adequate concipere non possumus, ideo inadequatis et
       distinctis conceptibus, inadequate essentiam divinam
       repræsentantibus, eam apprehendimus, quos inadequatos conceptus,
       qui a parte rei essentiæ divinæ identificantur, et a nobis per
       modum affectionum apprehenduntur, attributa vocamus.: [1202]1
     * Sicut in ipso grano invisibiliter erant omnia simul quæ per tempora
       in arborem surgerent; ita ipse mundus cogitandus est, cum Deus
       simul omnia creavit, habuisse simul omnia quæ in illo et cum illo
       facta sunt quando factus est dies: non solum coelum cum sole et
       luna et sideribus, quorum species manet motu rotabili, et terram et
       abyssos, quæ velut inconstantes motus patiuntur, atque inferius
       adjuncta partem alteram mundo conferunt; sed etiam illa quæ aqua et
       terra produxit potentialiter atque causaliter, priusquam per
       temporum moras ita exorirentur, quomodo nobis jam nota sunt in eis
       operibus, quæ Deus usque nunc operatur.: [1203]1
     * Societas fidei et Spiritus Sancti in cordibus.: [1204]1
     * Solus Deus summe simplex est, ut nec actus et potentiæ, nec esse et
       essentiæ compositio ipsi competat.: [1205]1
     * Spiritu sancto dictante.: [1206]1
     * Spiritus perfectissimus, conditor, conservator, et gubernator
       mundi.: [1207]1
     * Spiritus perfectissimus, rationem q: [1208]1
     * Spiritus substantia est Sermonis, et Sermo operatio Spiritus, et
       duo unum sunt.: [1209]1
     * Summa potentia non est nisi omnia possit, quantum ad legitimum
       posse attinet: nam malum facere aut se ipsum deponere aut in se
       converti hostiliter aut sibi ipsi contrarium esse posse impotentia
       est, non potentia.: [1210]1
     * Sunt nihil aliud quam instrumuenta, quibus Deus assidue instillat
       quantum vult efficaciæ et pro suo arbitrio ad hanc vel illam
       actionem flectit et convertit.: [1211]1
     * Synodus -- perspiciens hanc veritatem et disciplinam contineri in
       libris scriptis et sine scripto traditionibus, quæ ex ipsius
       Christi ore ab apostolis acceptæ, aut ab ipsis apostolis, Spiritu
       Sancto dictante, quasi per manus traditæ, ad nos usque pervenerunt;
       orthodoxorum patrum exempla secuta, omnes libros tam Veteris quam
       Novi Testamenti, cum utriusque unus Deus sit auctor, nec non
       traditiones ipsas, tum ad fidem tum ad mores pertinentes, tanquam
       vel ore tenus a Christo, vel a Spiritu Sancto dictatas, et continua
       successione in Ecclesia Catholica conservatas, pari pietatis
       affectu et reverentia suscipit et veneratur.: [1212]1
     * Synodus considerans non parum utilitatis accedere posse Ecclesiæ
       Dei, si ex omnibus Latinis editionibus quæ circumferentur, sacrorum
       librorum, quænam pro authentica habenda sit, innotescat: statuit et
       declarat, ut hæc ipsa vetus et vulgata editio, quæ longo tot
       seculorum usu in ipsa Ecclesia probata est, in publicis
       lectionibus, disputationibus, prædicationibus et expositionibus pro
       authentica habeatur et nemo illam rejicere quovis prætextu audeat
       vel præsumat.: [1213]1
     * Ubi fides vera est, ibi Ecclesia est.: [1214]1
     * Una eademque sempiterna et immutabili voluntate res quas condidit
       et ut prius non essent egit, quamdiu non fuerunt, et ut posterius
       essent, quando esse coeperunt.: [1215]1
     * Unde liquido apparet ipsum factum non esse per quem facta sunt
       omnia. Et si factus non est, creatura non est: si autem creatura
       non est, ejusdem cum Patre substantiæ est. Omnis enim substantia
       quæ Deus non est, creatura est; et quæ creatura non est, Deus est.:
       [1216]1
     * Ut opus aliquod sit verum miraculum duo requiruntur. Unum, est
       veritas rei; alterum, veritas finis.: [1217]1
     * Veracitas Deo duplici sensu recte adscribitur, (1.) Quatenus
       nunquam errat, quia est omniscius, nunquam errorem aliis
       significat, quia id repugnat bonitati ejus. . . . . (2.) Quatenus
       Deus ea actu sentit, quæ verbis vel factis entibus intelligentibus
       significat. Deus actionibus et sermonibus suis eum intendit finem,
       ut sibi homines credant, confidant, etc., quem finem everteret si
       semel a veritate discederet. Scriptura docet idem scil. : [1218]1
     * Vere dixi non omnes libros qui sunt in Hebræo Canone dictatos a
       Spiritu Sancto. Scriptos esse cum pio animi motu, non nego; et hoc
       est quod judicavit Synagoga Magna, cujus judicio in hac re stant
       Hebræi. Sed a Spiritu Sancto dictari historias nihil fuit opus:
       satis fuit scriptorem memoria valere circa res spectatas, aut
       diligentia in describendis veterum commentariis.: [1219]1
     * Veritas Dei in dictis, quæ singulatim vocari solet veracitas, est
       convenientia verborum omnium cum recta cogitatione animique
       sententia, et efficaci voluntatis proposito.: [1220]1
     * Veritas Dei in essentia, est convenientia omnium eorum, quæ ad
       naturam perfectissimi pertinent eamque totam constituunt; qua
       ratione Deus verus opponitur fictis et commentitiis.: [1221]1
     * Veritas Dei in intellectu, est convenientia cogitationum cum
       objecto.: [1222]1
     * Veritas Dei in voluntate est convenientia decreti ac propositi
       efficacis cujusque cum rationibus in intellectu probe cognitis et
       judicatis.: [1223]1
     * Viciniora ista, quibus causarum nomen damus, non jure causas esse
       sed manus et organa, quibus æterna mens operatur.: [1224]1
     * Vinculo pietatis obstricti, Deo religati sumus, unde ipsa religio
       nomen accepit, non, ut Cicero interpretatus est, a religendo.:

     * Virtualiter: [1226]1
     * Virtus est ipsa humana potentia: [1227]1
     * Visio Dei totius universitatis est conditio. Non enim aliud est ei
       videre, aliud facere; sed visio illius voluntas ejus est, et
       voluntas operatio.: [1228]1
     * Voluntas Dei est, qua Deus tendit in bonum ab intellectu cognitum.:
       [1229]1
     * Voluntas ab intellectu non differt, quia intelligendo vult et
       volendo intelligit. Intelligere et velle ejus idemque perpetuus
       indivisus actus.: [1230]1

     * Bildungstrieb: [1450]1
     * "Gott," says Schleiermacher, "weiss Alles was ist; und Alles ist,
       was Gott weiss und dieses beides ist nicht zweierlei sondern
       einerlei, weil sein Wissen und sein allmächtiges Wollen eines und
       dasselbe ist,": [1451]1
     * "Mit der Freiheit," he says, "war die Möglichkeit des Misbrauchs
       gegeben; ohne jene zu vernichten, konnte Gott diesen nicht
       verhindern.": [1452]1
     * Alles ist ganz durch die göttliche Allmacht und ganz durch den
       Naturzusammenhang, nicht aber darf die erstere als Ergänzung der
       letztern angesehen werden. Die Gesammtheit des endlichen Seins ist
       als vollkommene Darstellung der Allmacht zu denken, so dass alles
       wirklich ist und geschieht, wozu eine Productivität in Gott ist.
       Damit fällt weg die Differenz des Wirklichen und Möglichen, des
       absoluten und hypothetischen Wollens oder Könnens Gottes; denn dies
       führt auf einen wirksamen und unwirksamen Willen und letzterer kann
       bei Gott unmöglich statt finden; so wenig als Können und Wollen
       getrennt sein können.: [1453]1
     * Bei Gott ist Allwissenheit und Weisheit so gänzlich einerlei, dass
       die Unterscheidung keinen Werth hat, die Weisheit wäre nichts als
       auch wider absolute Lebendigkeit der Allmacht, also Alwissenheit.:
       [1454]1
     * Beziehungen: [1455]1
     * Bildungstrieb: [1456]1 [1457]2 [1458]3
     * Das gottgleiche All ist nicht allein das ausgesprochene Wort Gottes
       (natura naturata: [1459]1
     * Der das Nichtseiende als Seiendes hervorruft.: [1460]1
     * Die Annahme einer Schöpfung ist der Grund-Irrthum aller falschen
       Metaphysik und Religionslehre, und insbesondere das Ur-Princip des
       Juden- und Heidenthums.: [1461]1
     * Die Ewigkeit ist die Einheit in dem Unterschiede der Zeitmomente --
       Ewigkeit und Zeit verhalten sich wie die Substanz und deren
       Accidentien.: [1462]1
     * Die Heiden wissen nicht, woher das Unglück so plötzlich kommt; aber
       wir wissen es, dass es eitel Teufels Arbeit ist, der hat solche
       Helleparten, Bleikugeln und Büchsen, solche Spiesse und Schwerter,
       damit er unter uns schiesst, wirft und sticht, wenn Gott es ihm
       erlaubt. Darum zweifle nur Niemand dran, wo ein Feuer aufgehet,
       dass ein Dorf oder ein Haus abbrennet, da sitzt allewege ein
       Teufelein dabei, das bläset immer in das Feuer, dass es soll
       grosser werden." "Ein Christ soll das wissen, dass er mitten unter
       den Teufeln sitze, und dass ihm der Teufel näher sei denn sein Rock
       oder Hemde, ja näher denn seine eigene Haut, dass er rings um uns
       her sei, und wir also stets mit ihm zu Haare liegen und uns mit ihm
       schlagen müssen.: [1463]1
     * Die dritte Consequenz endlich ist die, dass Gott der Sohn auch als
       identisch gesetzt ist mit dem Subject, in welchem die religiöse
       Vorstellung den Ursprung des Bösen anschaut, mit dem Satan,
       Phosphoros, Lucifer. Diese Verschmelzung begründet sich darin, dass
       der Sohn innerhalb Gottes das Moment der Unterscheidung ist, in dem
       Unterschied aber die Möglichkeit der Entgegensetzung und Entzweiung
       angelegt ist. Der Sohn ist der selbstbewusste Gott.: [1464]1
     * Die ganze christliche Anschauung von dem Verhältniss Gottes zur
       Welt, von Schöpfung, Vorsehung und Wunder bezeugt diess (namely,
       that the Absolute is a person). Der Persönlichkeit ist freier Wille
       wesentlich; die Freiheit verwirklicht sich in einzelnen beliebigen
       Willensacten: durch einen solchen hat Gott die Welt geschaffen,
       durch eine Reihe von solchen regiert er sie, durch solche Acte
       greift er auch ausser der Ordnung seiner continuirlichen
       weltlenkenden Thätigkeit in die Weltordnung ein.: [1465]1
     * Die innerliche Lebendigkeit der Religion ist allezeit Mystik:
       [1466]1
     * Die schlechthinige Abhängigkeit des Bestehens und Verlaufes der
       Welt gestattet keinerlei andere Ursächlichkeiten als nur die
       göttliche, so dass Zwischenursachen nur seine Instrumente und
       Organe sind, er die durch ihre Gesammtheit wie durch alle einzelnen
       Zwischenursachen allein hindurchwirkende Causalität. Dieses ist er
       vermöge der præsentia essentialis numinis: [1467]1

     * Insofern Gott gedacht wird als die Welt mit seinem Bewusstseyn
       umfassend, nennen wir ihn den Allwissenden.: [1476]1
     * Jede Religion als Ergebniss einer Volksbildung ist angemesen oder
       subj. wahr; wahr an sich ist die, welche der vollendeten Ausbildung
       der Menschheit entspricht.: [1477]1
     * Mit diesem Können fällt auch die Freiheit im Sinne eines
       Wahlvermögens hinweg.: [1478]1
     * Mysticismus ist eine einseitige Herrschaft und eine Ausartung der
       mystischen Richtung.: [1479]1
     * Ohne Du kein Ich: [1480]1
     * Ohne Phosphor kein Gedanke.: [1481]1
     * Ohne Welt kein Gott; und ohne Gott keine Welt.: [1482]1
     * Seine Existenz als Wesen ist unser Denken von ihm; aber seine reale
       Existenz ist die Natur, zu welcher das einzelne Denkende als moment
       gehört.: [1483]1
     * So wollen also die Begriffe des Absoluten und des Heiligen nicht
       zusammengehen; sondern wer das Absolute festhält, der löst die
       Heiligkeit auf, welche nur an einem in Relation gestellten Wesen
       etwas ist; und wer es umgekehrt mit der Heiligkeit ernstlich nimmt,
       der tritt der Idee der Absolutheit zu nahe, welche durch den
       leisesten Schatten der Möglichkeit, anders zu sein als sie ist,
       verunreinigt wird. Diese Einsicht in die Unanwendbar keit
       moralischer Attribute auf Gott hatten schon einzelne Kirchenväter .
       . . erkanute: [1484]1
     * Unter der Ewigkeit Gottes verstehen wir die mit allem Zeitlichen

Index of French Words and Phrases

     * écoulement et liquefaction de l'âme en Dieu: [1495]1
     * Dieu: [1496]1
     * Dieu n'est point nécessité, métaphysiquement parlant, à la création
       de ce monde. . . . . Cependant Dieu est obligé, par une nécessité
       morale, à faire les choses en sorte qu'il ne se puisse rien de
       mieux.: [1497]1
     * Il me semble, qu'il en faut conclure, que Dieu fait tout, et qu'il
       n'y a point dans toutes les créatures de causes premières, ni
       secondes, ni même occasionelles.: [1498]1
     * Je ne trouve rien dans les créatures de plus propre à illustrer ce
       sujet, que la réflexion des espirits, lorsqu'un même esprit est son
       propre objet immediat, et agit sur soi-même en pensant à soi-même
       et à ce qu'il fait. Car le redoublement donne une image ou ombre de
       deux substances respectives dans une même substance absolue, savoir
       de celle qui entend, et de celle qui est entendue; l'un et l'autre
       de ces êtres est substantiel, l'un et l'autre est un concret
       individu, et ils différent par des rélations mutuelles, mais ils ne
       sont qu'une seule et même substance individuelle absolue.: [1499]1
     * Noveau Grand-Être Suprême: [1500]1
     * On ne peut dire que Dieu me crée premièrement, et qu' étant crée,
       il produise avec moi mes mouvemens et mes déterminations. Cela est
       insoutenable pour deux raisons: la première est, que quand Dieu me
       crée on me conserve à cet instant, il ne me conserve pas comme un
       être sans forme, comme une espèce ou quelque autre des universaux
       de logique. Je suis un individu; il me crée et conserve comme tel,
       étant tout ce que je suis dans cet instant avec toutes mes
       dépendances.: [1501]1
     * Roi: [1502]1
     * culte systématique de l'humanité: [1503]1
     * en dernière analyse il les place dans la raison divine: c'est la
       qu' elles existent substantiellement.: [1504]1
     * en outre: [1505]1
     * sans Dieu ni Roi: [1506]1
