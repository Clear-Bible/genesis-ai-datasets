  THE

                               APOCALYPTICAL KEY;

   or,

   The synchronism and order of the Apocalyptical Prophecies, according to
   the things transacted, on no hypothetical interpretation, nor
   preconjecture about the events; but firmly demonstrated from the very
   characters of the visions themselves, purposely inserted by the Holy
   Spirit, and offered to examination according to a self-evident scheme:
   so that it may prove, as it were, a Thesean clew to those who are
   involved in this sacred labyrinth, and a Lydian stone to discover the
   true, and to refute every erroneous interpretation.

  PREVIOUS REMARKS.

   1. I CALL a synchronism of the prophecies a concurrence of events
   predicted therein within the same time; which may be called a
   contemporary or coetaneous period; for prophecies of contemporary
   things synchronize.

   2. The order of the seals and of the trumpets included under them, is
   certain and indubitable; namely, that which the number points out from
   I. to VII. When the rest of the prophecies are compared with one
   another, and then with the seals by synchronism, the order of the whole
   Apocalypse will be manifest; and this, with God's assistance, we now
   proceed to exhibit.

   O thou that sittest on the throne, and thou, O Lamb, the root and the
   offspring [1] of David, who alone vast worthy to receive and open the
   book, open the eyes of thy servant, direct his hand and his mind, that
   in these thy mysteries he may discern and disclose something to the
   glory of thy name, and to the advantage of the Church!

  SYNCHRONISM I.

   Of the Woman driven into the Wilderness.

   Of the Seven-Headed Beast restored.

   Of the Outer Court trodden down by the Gentiles.

   Of the Witnesses on Earth prophesying in Sackcloth.

   IT is from hence that I begin, and my first synchronism shall be that
   of the remarkable quaternion of prophecies displayed in equal intervals
   of time. First, Of the woman living in the wilderness for a time,
   times, and a half, or (as it is there more fully expressed) for 1260
   days. Secondly, Of the seven-headed beast restored, and endued with
   power for forty-two months. Thirdly, Of the exterior court (or of the
   Holy City) trodden down by the Gentiles for the same number of months.
   Fourthly, and lastly, Of the witnesses prophesying in sackcloth for
   1260 days.

   The truth of this synchronism is almost evident of itself, and seems
   capable of being confirmed, as it generally is, by the very equality of
   the periods; for a time, times, and half a time, i. e. three years and
   a half (as appears from the collation of the 6th verse with the 14th of
   chapter xii.), make up forty-two months, and forty-two months 1260
   days.

   But because it does not necessarily follow, (though in visions
   presented at the same time it is extremely probable) that equal times
   are also synchronic, since equality does not prevent some things being
   prior, and some subsequent to others, the character of equality will
   not be adapted to compel reluctant assent; I will search, therefore,
   for characters elsewhere, from which I may put an end to the matter by
   clear and irrefragable demonstration.

   Of the Beast and the Woman.

   The times of the beast and of the woman residing in the wilderness,
   begin from one and the same point; namely, from the red dragon's being
   conquered, and cast out on the earth. As therefore they are equal, they
   must of necessity run together through the whole period, and at length
   complete their course together. That the times of each commence from
   the same point or terminus, is evident from the 12th chapter; since as
   soon as the dragon is cast out by Michael, the woman flies from his
   face into the wilderness, and the dragon being angry, that he had in
   vain attempted to overwhelm her, as she was departing thither, went to
   make war on the remnant of her seed, with those whom she was about to
   bring forth in the wilderness [2] , and standing on the sand of the
   sea, he delivered to the ten-horned beast ascending from thence, his
   power, and his throne, and great authority.

   Of the Beast and the Prophecy of the Witnesses.

   The times of the beast and of the prophecy of the witnesses being also
   equal, finish together at the end of the sixth trumpet. It is manifest
   that they began together, and were contemporary through the whole
   intervening space.

   Now that the times of the beast, and of the witnesses of God
   prophesying in sackcloth [3] finish at the end of the sixth trumpet, is
   clear from v. 14. c. xi., where not only both the ascent of the
   witnesses into heaven (which is the termination of this mourning
   prophecy), but the great earthquake (by which the royal city is thrown
   down, and the kingdom of the beast destroyed), is marked out by the
   point of time at which the second woe (or sixth trumpet) is past, and
   the third woe (or seventh trumpet) is immediately about to commence.
   For in that moment of time, the witnesses, whom the beast risen out of
   the abyss had killed, as they were just about to finish their testimony
   (for that is the meaning of hotan telesosi), being divinely revived,
   ascended into heaven. And in the same hour there was a great
   earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and then it came to
   pass, at the sound of the seventh trumpet, that the kingdoms of this
   world became the kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ.

   Of the Witnesses and Court (or Holy City) occupied by the Gentiles.

   It is plain that the times of the witnesses and of the court (or Holy
   City) occupied by the Gentiles, are contemporary, from the meaning of
   the text, c. xi. v. 2, 3. as from the wrath of the Gentiles, who are
   thrust out at the beginning of the seventh trumpet; that is, at the end
   of the sixth, when the days of the witnesses likewise expire, as has
   just been shown. For the nations or Gentiles, who at v. 18. are said to
   be inflamed with anger at the sound of the seventh trumpet, are no
   other than those, who for the whole forty-two months had trodden down
   the outer court of the temple; that is, the Holy City, and who are now,
   on that account, about to be destroyed by the wrath of God.

   This synchronism is not wont to be called in question by any one that I
   know or recollect.

   Of the Witnesses, Court, Beast, and Woman.

   If the treading down of the court and Holy City be contemporary with
   the prophecy of the witnesses, it will be contemporary likewise with
   the beast with whom the witnesses contemporize, and therefore with the
   woman in the wilderness also, with whom the beast contemporizes. So
   that the woman in the wilderness, the dominion of the beast, the
   conculcation of the Holy City, and the prophecy of the witnesses, all
   synchronize with one another.

   SYNCHRONISM II.

   Of the Two-Horned Beast (who is also the False Prophet), with the
   Ten-Horned Beast (who is likewise called the Image of the Beast).

   The two-horned beast is the founder, or re-establisher of the
   seven-headed beast, crowned with a diadem of ten horns, which, in fact,
   after his deadly wound, he restored to the image of his former state,
   to the great detriment of the saints, and who became possessed of power
   for forty-two months. Having done which, he exercises all his power
   before him, and shows forth, or performs, great wonders in his sight.
   But at length, this same two-horned beast (which John otherwise calls
   the false prophet), together with the other beast, in whose sight he
   wrought miracles, are taken as inseparable companions, and are both
   cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone. Since,
   therefore, the ten-horned beast (for so I may be permitted to call the
   seven-headed beast when reinstated, for the sake of perspicuity), and
   the two-horned false prophet are not separated from each other either
   in their origin or destruction; but the one administers the power of
   the other, enopion autou; that is, in his presence; who does not
   perceive that they are necessarily contemporary through their whole
   period of time? But that the whole matter may be rightly understood, we
   ought to be aware that no other state of the seven-headed beast is
   described in the 13th chapter, than that of his restoration, or last
   head, in which he became ten-horned, as the whole series of the
   description evinces. For whatever mischief the beast is said to have
   perpetrated, whatever worship and adoration was paid to him by the
   inhabitants of the earth, is all reported as having been done after his
   re-establishment, or the cure of his wound. Moreover, it is manifest
   from the interpretation of the angel, c. xvii., that the ten horns
   belong to the last head or state of the beast, which is the state of
   his restoration; since at that time, after five heads had fallen, that
   is, had fulfilled their parts, the sixth was even then performing his
   in the age of John, and yet "the time of the horns" is said to be "not
   yet come." Therefore they must necessarily belong to the seventh or
   last head.

   APPENDIX.

   On the alternate Use of the Names of the Beast and False Prophet; as
   also of the Beast and Image of the Beast.

   The title of the synchronism reminds us of both. And first, Iræneus has
   observed, that, from the most ancient writers on the Apocalypse, the
   bicorned beast and the false prophet are the same; which, from the
   comparison of v. 13, 14, 15, 16, of c. xiii. with v. 20 of c. xix., is
   so clear and manifest, that it requires no farther confirmation. But
   what the title sets forth in addition, that the ten-horned beast is
   otherwise accustomed to be denoted by the name of the image of the
   beast, is less apparent, and would not perhaps be suspected by a reader
   who was not very attentive: Yet, that it is so, I am persuaded I have
   not rashly remarked; and therefore, wherever the beast occurs with the
   false prophet, (which I find it does three times,) then by the name of
   the beast, the ten-horned beast is alone to be understood; since, by
   the false prophet, it is sufficiently clear that the two-horned beast
   is designated. On the other hand, when you find the beast compared with
   the image of the beast there, by the beast the false prophet is to be
   understood; but by his image, the ten-horned beast, or the seven-horned
   beast restored: for, since the latter acknowledges the false prophet as
   his restorer, and suffers himself to be wholly guided by his will, as
   by that of a supreme lord, he is not improperly called his image; not,
   indeed, the image of one whose similitude he bears, as if the genitive
   were used passively, (for, in that respect, he is the image of another,
   perhaps of the seven-headed dragon, or of the state in which he
   flourished before his wound, in resemblance of whom he blasphemes God
   anew, and wages war against the Saints,) but an image, of whose
   restoration that two-horned and dragon-speaking beast was the author,
   and whom he claimed as his own; the genitive denoting the agent and
   possessor, as, in the same passage, the mark of the beast is not a mark
   impressed on the beast itself, but one with which the beast brands his
   worshippers.

   And that what I have said is the right interpretation of the image of
   the beast, the first proof I would bring is, that it is said, c. xiii.
   v. 15, that the very image of the beast, which the false prophet had
   just animated, caused that as many as would not worship the image of
   the beast should be slain; nay, in other places, (that you may
   acknowledge the beast,) it is generally subjoined to a word expressive
   of worship, or as something to which worship is suited. Since,
   therefore, the Apocalypse describes two beasts only, and not more, this
   wicked majesty, with an equal power of commanding or compelling, cannot
   but belong to one or the other of them. Moreover, when the beast is
   present at the same time as the false prophet, the image of the beast
   does not occur in the same sentence, as if then, in fact, the
   appellation of beast supplied its place. Lastly, it is said to be the
   image of the beast, of which there is a number and a name; but the name
   and number of no other beast seem to be mentioned than that of the
   two-horned. Of the same, then, (as of a maker and lord,) he is justly
   said to be the image. But this image, whether it be or not the
   ten-horned beast, is of no consequence to our system; for the
   synchronism of the beasts does not rest on this hypothesis.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SYNCHRONISM III.

   Of the great Harlot, or Mystic Babylon, with the same Seven-headed and
   Ten-horned Beast.

   1. The time of the beast is the time of the wilderness. (Syn. i. s. 1.)
   Now, the harlot is seen by John in the wilderness; but this description
   is not of much force.

   2. The ten-horned beast carries the harlot or adulteress, and the
   harlot sits on the beast: therefore, both exist at one and the same
   time.

   3. The ten horns of the beast (which, in truth, spring from its highest
   and last head,) and under whose dominion alone the harlot manages the
   beast, and the beast carries the harlot, (the times of the other heads
   having been previously completed after it revived as from a deadly
   wound); these ten horns, I say, "are ten kings which receive their
   authority as kings for one hour with the beast;" viz. with the
   reinstated beast, which carries the adulteress, and is now ten-horned;
   that is, exercising the office of the last head. These, when the time
   has been fulfilled, during which "they were to deliver up their power
   to the beast;" that is, when the connexion with the beast is just ready
   to be dissolved, "will hate the harlot, render her desolate and naked,
   and at length burn her with fire." So then the beast, which in its
   ten-horned state (the only state in which it is prophetically
   contemplated by John) first commenced with the harlot or adulteress,
   will not survive her, nor will the harlot survive the beast. The harlot
   and beast, therefore, universally and exactly synchronize, which was
   the object to be proved.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SYNCHRONISM IV.

   Of the Hundred and Forty-four Thousand Sealed, who were Virgins, with
   the Babylonian Harlot and the Beast.

   1. In the first place, they are called virgins, and are praised on that
   account, because they had not defiled themselves with meretricious
   embraces. They coincide, therefore, with the meretricious times of the
   Babylonian harlot, "with whom the kings and inhabitants of the earth
   committed fornication."

   2. Out of this virgin choir proceed those who denounce the ruin of
   Babylon, and who deter men from all communion with the beast, his
   image, and mark. Therefore, the virgin assembly is contemporary with
   Babylon and the beast.

   3. These, lastly, are those that are called the chosen and faithful
   attendants on the Lamb, accompanied by whom, he wages war with the
   kings, or horns, of the Babylonian beast, and who, under his auspices,
   (as King of kings and Lord of lords,) will at length obtain the
   victory. For those words, relative to the Lord of lords and King of
   kings, ought, I think, to be read in a parenthesis, where the angel
   says, "These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome
   them, (for he is Lord of lords and King of kings,) and they who are
   with him, are called, and chosen, and faithful;" that is, the Lamb, and
   those who are with him, called, and elect, and faithful, shall overcome
   the Babylonish kings.

   4. But these observations are not sufficient for the firm establishment
   of a complete contemporary agreement; for all these things may be
   consistent with partial contemporation. I therefore proceed, in the
   following manner, to demonstrate that the assembly of the sealed
   attendants on the Lamb are universally and exactly contemporary with
   the beast. That assembly of the sealed ones is an Antistoichon, or
   opposite state, coeval with the beast, or the whole company of the
   followers of the beast; that is, the forces of those holy soldiers
   remaining still in the faith of the Lamb, when the other inhabitants of
   the world, as deserters and rebels, have received the mark of the
   beast. This is obvious from the text: whence, as formerly, by ancient
   custom, slaves and soldiers were wont to be distinguished by the mark,
   and inscribed by the name of him to whom they had pledged their faith,
   so these are said to bear "the name of the Lamb and his Father on their
   foreheads." Since this is the case, it follows that the duration of the
   one is commensurate with that of the other, and agrees with it
   altogether, during the same interval of time: for the mode of this sort
   of opposition requires that the assembly of the sealed followers of the
   Lamb, as far as it is pointed out by the vision, should be understood
   in a manner wholly opposite to that of the beast; beyond which
   opposition, agreeably to the intention of the vision, it has no
   meaning, and therefore it begins where that begins, and ends where that
   ends.

   5. Moreover, with respect to the close of the contemporary period, that
   may be proved from the description in c. vii.; because the palm-bearing
   multitude is the limit both of the tyranny of the beast, and of the
   company of those who were sealed;--of the beast, because it is there
   said, "These are they who have come out of great tribulation;" but out
   of what tribulation, except that of the beast persecuting the saints?
   Therefore, they left behind the tyranny of the beast. Of the sealed
   company, because the palm-bearing multitude immediately follows, as is
   manifest from that transition, "After these things I saw," &c.
     __________________________________________________________________

  V.

   A Corollary of the General Synchronism of all the circumstances
   previously enumerated.

   It follows that the revived, or ten-horned beast is contemporary with
   the woman in the wilderness, with the conculcation of the Holy City,
   and with the lamentation of the witnesses, during the same period,
   Synch. I. The two-horned beast with the ten-horned beast, Synch. II.
   The harlot with both, Synch. III. The virgin company of those who are
   sealed with the harlot and the beast, Synch. IV. Therefore all
   synchronize with each other.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SYNCHRONISM VI.

   Of the Measure of the Interior Court by the Reed of God, with the
   Snares of the Seven-headed Dragon, and his Battle with Michael
   concerning the Birth of the Child.

   These are the nearest antecedents of contemporary events; the battle of
   the dragon and the birth of the child, with the habitation of the woman
   in the wilderness, and the rise of the ten-horned beast. The interior
   court, (for what is said of the temple of God, of the altar of incense,
   and of the priests worshipping there according to custom, is a
   periphrasis of this expression,) to the exterior court, or that of the
   people, where the nations are represented to have been unjustly and
   unlawfully housed as in a stable.

   To prove this: In the first place, both the delivery of the woman, and
   the battle of the dragon with Michael, impinge on the same termination,
   viz. the flight of the woman into the wilderness, which is said to have
   followed next to the act of both: For the woman, as soon as she had
   brought forth a son, "fled into the wilderness," there to be nourished
   for 1260 days. In like manner, when the dragon was cast out, the woman
   "fled into the wilderness, there to be nourished from the face of the
   serpent, for a time, and times, and half a time." These two things,
   therefore, as you see, the title of the synchronism combines into one,
   as visions of the same time and subject, completely connected, and
   which it is unnecessary to separate in this investigation. Moreover,
   that battle in which Michael conquered the dragon, immediately preceded
   the restoration of the seven-headed or ten-horned beast; for the
   dragon, as soon as he was cast out into the earth, "standing on the
   sand of the sea shore, delivers up for the future his office, that is,
   his authority, his throne, and great power, to the beast emerging from
   thence;" and (as the Complutensian edition renders it, together with
   Irenæus) "one of his heads, as it were, wounded to death, whose wounds
   being cured, all the world followed the beast, wondering."

   And thus far the matter is plain and obvious; but of the antecedence of
   the interior to the outer court, (which alone remains to the completion
   of the synchronism,) the mode of proof is a little more difficult,
   because the subject has long been otherwise understood, and is
   therefore impeded by prejudices.

   The inner court, in consequence of the structure of the temple,
   precedes the outer court in situation and order, as being nearest to
   the throne of God, or to Nao, the head of the whole structure.
   Therefore, if things should be significant of different times, (for it
   is not a novelty that order of situation should denote order of time,
   as in the statue which Nebuchadnezzar dreamt he saw,) then it is
   agreeable to reason that the indicated time of the interior court
   should be prior to the indicated time of the exterior.

   Now that there is an indication of different times relative to the
   courts, and consequently that the indication of the interior court is
   more ancient, and prior to the other, I thus farther demonstrate.
   Because this vision of the measurement of the court of the temple and
   altar, or of the inner court, is the beginning of a repeated prophecy,
   which, indeed, (as will soon be more fully shown,) rehearses from the
   beginning, and as it were above, the times of the prophecy of the
   seals, whose commencement no one can have doubted, must be sought for
   from that epoch of the apocalyptical period. "You must prophesy" (says
   he) "again," (thus he explains the symbol of the eaten book) "before
   many people, and nations, and tongues, and kings." "Palin," that is, in
   a renewed order of the times of which he had before prophesied. But he
   begins from the measurement of the temple and altar of incense, and of
   those who worshipped there. If, then, the vision concerning the
   delivery of the woman, and the battle of the dragon, (which is itself a
   part of this repeated prophecy), ascend to the very commencement of the
   period or apocalyptical time, even so far, that the Apocalypse has
   nothing more ancient, or that deduces its origin from a higher source,
   (and this will appear, both from the nature of the circumstance, the
   birth of a child, and from synchronisms already confirmed, and to be
   still farther confirmed,) why should not the beginning of the same
   prophecy and the first of all the visions, with still greater
   probability, be presumed to ascend as far? But the months of the outer
   court cannot reach so high, as they are wholly contemporary with the
   ten-horned beast: therefore, it is very evident to me, that the times
   of the inner and measured court not only precede the months of the
   outer and unmeasured one, but ought to be derived from the origin of
   the repeated prophecy, as well as the vision of the birth of the child,
   and of the dragon.

   Now, these three events--the habitation of the woman in the wilderness,
   the ten-horned beast, and the outer court trodden down by the Gentiles,
   appear to be contemporary from the first synchronism: therefore the
   times of the inner court measured, and the delivery of the woman,
   together with the wiles of the dragon, and the battle with Michael,
   being the nearest antecedents of those contemporary events, must
   contemporize with one another. Q. E. D.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SYNCHRONISM VII.

   Of the Seven Phials; with the Beast and Babylon declining to their
   Fall.

   The effusion of the phials brings ruin and destruction on the beast, as
   is manifest from the text. For the conquerors of the beast sing the
   song of Moses, epinikion or the song of victory. c. xv. v. 2, 3. And it
   appears especially, from the first phial, c. xvi. v. 2, which sends the
   plague of an ulcer "on the men who had the mark of the beast, and on
   those who adore his image;" from the fifth, which is poured "on the
   throne of the beast," and which renders his kingdom dark; and also from
   the last, on the pouring out of which Babylon is wholly overthrown.
   Therefore, the effusion of the phials is contemporary with the
   concluding scenes of the beast and Babylon.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

   PART II.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I have completed the First Part in Seven Synchronisms: The other Part,
   that of the Seals, follows, in which I will demonstrate the connexion
   of all the prophecies which have been hitherto recited; and if there
   are any besides, of those likewise with the seals, in as many other
   synchronisms: Whence it will plainly appear, (and it may be adduced as
   a matter very worthy of observation, and, unless I am deceived, of no
   small consequence in the subsequent interpretation,) that the whole
   Apocalypse, from the fourth chapter, (for I introduce nothing now about
   the seven churches,) is divided into two principal prophecies, of which
   each commences from the same epoch, and, as it were, from one barrier,
   and ends at the same goal. The first is that of the seals, and in them
   of the trumpets, for the seventh seal is the seal of the trumpets,
   which I take every where for granted, from the grammatical sense of the
   context. For it is not to be supposed that the order of sense is
   preserved in all the other seals, but is unsuitable to the seventh
   alone, as what is submitted to view on the opening of a seal, that is,
   to pragma, the subject of the seal. Now, the vision of the seven angels
   with the seven trumpets follows the unclosing of the seventh seal. The
   other prophecy (or, if you will, the system of prophetic visions) is
   that tou biblaridaou, or of the open book, which, commencing from the
   same beginning of apocalyptical time, retraces the times of the former
   prophecy, namely, that of the seals, from the 8th verse of the 10th
   chapter to the end of the book. And this repetition of the prophecy is
   indicated by that transition in the 11th verse of the same chapter,
   where the angel says to John, "Thou must prophesy again (palin) before
   many people, and nations, and tongues, and kings."

   Moreover, it will not perhaps be unworthy of the reader's attention,
   that at the beginning of each of those visions, as well of the first of
   all the visions, that of the seven churches, as of three entire
   prophecies, the commencement is proclaimed by "the voice, as it were,
   of a trumpet talking with St. John;" as if the Holy Spirit meant to
   distinguish them by this mark from other prophecies, which are parts of
   these principal ones, in which you will see nothing of a similar
   nature.

   Now, these are the beginnings of the prophecies to which I allude. Of
   the vision of the seven churches, in these words: "I was in the spirit
   on the Lord's day, and I heard a great voice behind me, as of a
   trumpet, saying," &c. Of the prophecy of the seals, in this manner:
   "And the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking
   with me," &c. Lastly, of the prophecy of the little book: "And the
   voice which I had heard from heaven" (i. e. as of a trumpet speaking)
   "spake again unto me, and said," &c.

   Thus far is prefatory, and, as I hope, not foreign from the subject of
   which we are treating. The Synchronisms now follow.
     __________________________________________________________________

  I.

  THE CARDINAL POINT OF THE SYNCHRONISMS;

    OR,

THE SYNCHRONISM

   Of the Seventh Seal, which relates to the first Six Trumpets; with the
   Ten-horned and Two-horned Beast, and other contemporary matters.

   And first, the beginning of the beast is contemporary with the
   beginning of the seventh seal, which is that of the trumpets.

   Since the assembly of those who were scaled, as the antithesis or
   opposite of the reign of the beast, synchronizes rightly and exactly
   with the beast; and since the same assembly begins with the opening of
   the seventh seal, or that of the trumpets, it follows clearly that the
   beast also must begin with the same seventh seal, or that of the
   trumpets.

   Now, it has been already shown by Synch. IV. Part I. that the assembly
   of the sealed must be altogether and exactly contemporary with the
   beast. That the same assembly begins with the seventh seal, is plain
   from the seventh chapter, where the act of sealing immediately follows
   the sixth seal; since, as soon as the vision of the sixth seal is
   finished, and when the seventh, which is that of the trumpets, is just
   about to open, attention is paid to the elect servants of God by the
   impression of a seal, that they might not be destroyed by the storm of
   calamities which was brooding over the earthly globe.

   Now, the four angels who presided over the four quarters of the world,
   were just ready to let loose the winds (which they had hitherto
   restrained), at the sound of the trumpets. Attention must likewise be
   paid to the sound of the fifth trumpet, c. ix. v. 4. that you may
   understand, even from that indication, that the sealing belongs to the
   times of the trumpets. It is beyond all doubt that the conclusion and
   termination of the sixth seal is the beginning of the seventh, since
   the series of the seals with respect to each other, cannot and ought
   not to be interrupted. Therefore, it is necessary that the assembly of
   the 144,000 who are sealed, which follows the close of the sixth seal,
   should begin with the seventh, which succeeds not less immediately to
   the sixth. And so, with wonderful judgment (as I conceive), the Holy
   Spirit has pointed out to us beforehand, by this act of sealing, the
   connexion between the beginning of the beast, and the commencement of
   the seventh seal, since no other reason can be given why the series of
   the seals, which is not otherwise to be interrupted, should be
   disturbed by this vision of the sealed ones interposed in chap. vii.
   Secondly, the end of the beast is contemporary with the close of the
   sixth trumpet. For since the 1260 days of the witnesses' mourning in
   sackcloth finish at the end of the sixth trumpet, or the beginning of
   the seventh, there also must the forty-two months of the beast finish,
   and by consequence, the tyranny of the beast is comprised within the
   compass of the six first trumpets. Q. E. D.

   Now it has just been demonstrated, Part I. Synch. I. s. 3. that the
   forty-two months of the beast, in the same manner as the 1260 days of
   the mourning of the witnesses, contemporary with them, must finish at
   the close of the sixth trumpet, as it is shown from the 11th chapter,
   when the witnesses, after three days' death, being again restored to
   life, and carried up into heaven, had completed the days of their
   sorrowful prophecy, "a great convulsion of the earth having taken place
   at the same hour or time," the great city suffered destruction, and the
   beast, the cruel enemy of the witnesses, in consequence of the defeat
   which he then underwent, breathed his last. That we might know at what
   period of the seals and trumpets this happened, the Spirit has
   immediately subjoined, "The second woe (that is, the sixth trumpet) is
   now past, and the third woe (the seventh trumpet) cometh quickly."
   Which character I believe to be inserted here as another index of this
   great synchronism, or principally for this purpose, that it might be
   another of the hinges on which that great and universal frame of the
   prophecy of the little book and the seals might turn. Since otherwise,
   both this notice and the sound of the seventh trumpet, which
   immediately follows, would have been placed in right and natural order,
   at the end of the prophecy of the seals, chap. x. But the Holy Spirit,
   by the mystery of the seventh trumpet in that place presignified, in
   the manner of a proclamation briefly only, and as much as appeared
   sufficient at that time, (namely, that it would come to pass while that
   was sounding, "that the mystery of God should be finished as he had
   declared by the prophets,") wishes to suspend and postpone the uttering
   of that sound, and the full disclosure of the mystery for a little
   while, (and without doubt for some important purpose,) until, having
   made a transition to the new prophecy of the little book, he might
   bring the first vision, when it had run its apocalyptic course, to the
   same conclusion of events. For I would wish the reader very attentively
   to remark, that in this one vision of the 11th chapter, as the first of
   the renewed prophecy, the all-wise Spirit runs through the whole period
   of the sealed prophecy, as a warp through a woof, and connects the same
   with the seventh trumpet as with a sort of clasp, for the sake of
   directing the time to the series of the seals. But for what purpose,
   except that to the first vision thus fixed and compared with the seals,
   the remaining prophecies of the little book which succeed, being
   connected also by their own characters, the whole system of the renewed
   prophecy with the seals might be dexterously accommodated?

   Moreover, lest a scruple should occur to any one, that those things
   which are related in the text, of the consternation of the beast, of
   the ruin of the city, and of the slaughter of men occasioned by the
   earthquake, by no means appear as if they ought to be understood of the
   total abolition of the beast; I say that this is not requisite for that
   synchronism of which we have been treating; but that they should be
   taken at least of the concluding time of his power and kingdom, which
   is determined in forty-two months, and which, the synchronism of the
   beast and witnesses being acknowledged, must end at the same time with
   the days of the witnesses. But whatever shall survive of the beast for
   a little while, will therefore, as may here be collected, be under an
   appearance dissimilar from the former, so that it cannot be reckoned
   under the same description; but is likewise not long after to be wholly
   destroyed and abolished under the seventh trumpet, when "the kingdoms
   of this world shall become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of his
   Christ."

   And so it will be manifest, that by this cardinal synchronism well
   established, the rest may be easily deduced from it and connected with
   the seals.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SYNCHRONISM II.

   Of the contemporary term of the Interior Court, and the Battle between
   the Dragon and Michael concerning the Man Child, with the first Six
   Seals.

   Because they are the events next antecedent to the contemporary ones
   which succeed them; for the six first seals are the nearest antecedents
   of the seventh. The inner court and the battle of Michael with the
   dragon are the nearest antecedents of the beast, and of the assembly of
   the 144,000 sealed ones. Now the seventh seal (or what is nearly the
   same thing), the six first trumpets, are contemporaneous with the
   assembly of the sealed and the beast, as was shown by the former
   synchronism.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SYNCHRONISM III.

   Of the Phials with the Sixth Trumpet.

   The seven phials of the last wrath of God, since they are so many
   gradations of the ruin and fall of the beast, must necessarily begin
   from the commencement of this ruin and fall. But the kingdom of the
   beast, while the sixth trumpet was yet sounding, had so far begun to be
   undermined, and had proceeded to such an extent of ruin, that at the
   end of the same trumpet the power which was given it to exercise
   dominion, and to overcome the saints for forty-two months, was
   finished. But the beast could not have fallen to such a state of ruin
   and fatal calamity before the fifth phial at least was poured out, for
   then it appears at length that his seat was shaken, and his kingdom
   darkened. Therefore five, at least, of the phials are poured out before
   the sound of the sixth trumpet has ceased: I believe even the sixth,
   but the seventh phial, which is the phial of consummation, will
   therefore concur with the beginning of the seventh trumpet, which is
   also the trumpet of consummation.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SYNCHRONISM IV.

   Of the Thousand Years in which the Dragon or Satan is bound, with the
   Seventh Trumpet, or the Interval from the Destruction of the Beast.

   That this account of the binding of Satan may be better understood, it
   must be premised for a demonstration that it is said in the text, Satan
   was not only cast into the abyss, but shut up there, and that the angel
   set a seal upon him, that he might no longer seduce the nations until
   the 1000 years were completed. For it was the custom of the Hebrews and
   neighbouring nations, when they wished to have a door firmly secured
   and barred up, to affix a seal to it.

   Thus king Darius sealed with his signet and the signet of his nobles,
   the stone which was placed over the den of lions into which Daniel was
   cast. In the story in the Apocrypha, the servants of Daniel shut the
   doors of the Temple of Bel, and sealed them with the king's seal. In
   like manner the Jews secured the sepulchre of our Saviour, "sealing the
   stone and setting a watch;" or made it sure by sealing the stone, where
   it is to be observed that the Greek words asphalizein and sphagizein
   mutually explain each other. It is one thing then, and far different to
   be cast down from heaven, (which many accommodate to this place), and
   another to be bound, shut up in an abyss, and sealed. The former did
   not deprive him of his power of wandering about and doing mischief, the
   latter does not suffer him by any means to come out of his prison. Nay,
   I dare to affirm that not one of those things which are related in the
   20th chapter is to be found in the 12th, nor, on the other hand, is
   there one word to be found in the 20th of what is related in the 12th.
   So far from truth is the supposition that the same event is represented
   on both occasions. Let us, however, examine a little. In the 20th
   chapter four things are related of the dragon: first, that he was
   seized by the angel who descended from heaven; secondly, that he was
   bound; thirdly, that he was cast into the abyss; fourthly, that he was
   shut up and sealed there.

   You will find none of these things in the 12th. On the other hand, of
   what alone is narrated in the 12th chapter of the casting down the
   dragon from heaven to earth, not even a trace is to be found in the
   20th. Nay, from the very context it is easy to collect that no such
   transaction then took place. For there it is said, that the angel who
   came to bind the dragon, came down from heaven. Therefore the dragon
   was already on earth; for otherwise why should the angel have descended
   to lay hold of him? Hence, Michael did not descend from heaven, but had
   an engagement with the Devil in heaven itself. These things being
   premised, let us proceed to the exposition of the synchronism.

   Argument 1.--Under the first six seals the dragon, or Satan, was free
   and at large, and also under the first six trumpets of the seventh
   seal. It follows, therefore, that the 1000 years for which Satan is
   bound, are brought within the seventh trumpet. That Satan or the dragon
   was not bound while the first six seals were yet running their course,
   is plain from this circumstance, that in all that interval, as a red
   dragon with his seven heads and crowns, he was contending with Michael
   about the offspring of the woman, as was just now demonstrated. But
   neither did this take place under the first six trumpets of the
   following seal; for this is the period of the woman in the wilderness,
   and of the domination of the ten-horned beast, as appears from Synch.
   I. of this Part. In truth, while the woman was living in the
   wilderness, it was very unlikely that the dragon could. be considered
   as bound, who, when free and precipitated from heaven, in the first
   place attempted to overwhelm her with a flood of waters which he cast
   out of his mouth, as she was preparing to depart; and afterwards, when
   this attempt did not succeed according to his intention, (the earth
   having absorbed the flood, and the woman having withdrawn into the
   wilderness,) inflamed with wrath and fury, he went to make war with the
   remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of God, and have the
   testimony of Jesus Christ. Are these proofs of Satan's being bound? But
   let us see likewise (what is said of him) respecting the beast, and
   hear how the dragon was bound under his reign: Namely, the dragon gave
   him his power and his throne, and great authority, and all the world
   wondered after the beast, and worshipped the dragon which gave power to
   the beast. But could Satan perform all these acts while he was in
   prison Certainly in one shut up and sealed it was not possible. But
   that there may be no room for subterfuge, and that it may clearly
   appear how far the dragon was still free, and at liberty to perform
   such deeds, from those into whose custody he is said to be committed,
   in order to be restrained, behold his other pupil, the false prophet,
   the inseparable companion of the ten-horned beast, and the minister of
   the bestial power, of whom you have it written expressly, that he
   should perform great wonders, and deceive the inhabitants of the earth
   by the miracles which it was given him to perform. Now, who can readily
   believe that while these beasts were in possession of authority, the
   dragon, or Satan, was cast into the abyss, and a seal put upon him,
   that he might not deceive the nations any more? But from the trumpets
   themselves, (of the intermediate time at least,) there is not wanting
   an argument of the devil's being free and unbound. For is not that king
   of the locusts of the fifth trumpet, who is called the angel of the
   abyss, to whom the Hebrew name of Abaddon is applied, and the Greek of
   Apollyon, and whom John points out as him who had long since fallen to
   the earth, that very dragon himself and Satan whom Michael, before the
   trumpets had begun to sound, had cast down from heaven to earth? For in
   the whole Apocalypse, I do not remember to have read of any other
   besides him who fell to the earth, nor do I know any one else to whom
   those titles of the angel of the abyss and Abaddon could apply. However
   that may be, Satan was certainly not bound at that time; the bottomless
   pit (as it is there called) was not closed upon him and sealed, but
   open to that degree, that the smoke arose out of it, like the smoke of
   a great furnace, and the sun and air were darkened by the smoke: And
   lastly, the liberty of the dragon, or Satan, to deceive the nations,
   must have continued to the very ruin of the beast, and was therefore
   entirely coeval with the six first trumpets, which I think it
   impossible for any one to doubt, who has sufficiently attended to what
   is said to be done after the effusion of the sixth phial, that when the
   seventh, which is the last phial, is just about to be poured out, and
   therefore the last day of the beast was just at hand--"Out of the mouth
   of the dragon and his vicars, the beast, and the false prophet, three
   unclean spirits of demons working miracles go forth unto the kings of
   the earth, and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that
   great day of God Almighty."

   So the thousand years of Satan's bondage, in order that he might no
   longer deceive the nations, cannot be placed under the first six seals,
   nor under the first six trumpets. They must consequently be referred to
   the seventh trumpet.

   Argument 2.--Afterwards, when the thousand years are finished, and
   Satan, having been loosed from his prison for a short time, had excited
   new commotions, the rabble of deceived nations which he had collected
   having been consumed by fire sent down from heaven, he himself being
   taken as a deceiver, is said to be cast into a lake of fire and
   sulphur, where the beast and false prophet were. Observe here, reader,
   the mark of the time by which it is intimated that this event, whatever
   it is, of Satan's captivity and condemnation, after his renewed
   deliverance, succeeds as well in order of relation, as also in time of
   action, to the vision of the former chapter concerning the beast and
   false prophet being vanquished, captured, and in like manner cast into
   a lake of fire burning with sulphur, by him who sat on the white horse.
   For it would not otherwise be said that Satan was cast into the place
   where the beast and the false prophet were, unless the beast and the
   false prophet had been previously sent there.

   Nor let any shrewd person say, by way of evasion, that there is no
   difference between this war of the 20th chapter, after the one thousand
   years, and that of the former chapter; since not only the character
   displayed, but all the circumstances likewise, on both sides, are in
   direct contradiction to it--the parties, kind of battle, and mode of
   destruction. There by the sword; here by fire; nay, the event of each
   battle is also dissimilar, as will presently appear by demonstration.
   In that instance, it was the binding of Satan for a time; but in this,
   it is his condemnation to eternal fire.

   Since the war then in which the beast and the false prophet, when
   captured, are cast into a lake of fire, is different from the last, to
   which Satan, who was to be finally cast into the same lake, had excited
   the nations immediately after his liberation, it must have been waged
   either within the thousand years, or before they began. But within the
   thousand years it could not be waged, because so long Satan is said to
   have been shut up in the abyss, that he might not deceive the nations
   any longer until the thousand years were completed; c. xx. v. 3. But in
   the war in which victory was at length obtained over the beast, the
   false prophet, and their associates, (if ever otherwise,) lie was most
   free and at perfect liberty to deceive, as is apparent from what we
   have justly alleged from the 16th chapter, of the preparation for this
   war; namely, that after the effusion of the sixth phial, when the
   seventh, by which the beast was utterly destroyed, was just ready to be
   poured out, "from the mouth of the dragon, and from the mouth of the
   beast, and the false prophet, three impure spirits, like frogs, being
   the spirits of demons working miracles, went forth to the kings of the
   earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of the great
   day of God Almighty." Since then the period of the thousand years by no
   means admits of these disturbances and satanic commotions, it follows
   that this war of the beast preceded them in time. And thus at length
   the thousand years of Satan's bondage will contemporize with the
   interval from the destruction of the beast. Q. E. D.

   Argument 3.--Lastly, since, during the thousand years in which Satan is
   detained in custody, Christ may be said to have reigned with his
   followers over that august and magnificent kingdom, therefore, by the
   same arguments and marks by which the synchronism of the one is
   established, that of the other will be confirmed. That this august
   kingdom of Christ then begins with the seventh trumpet, or from the
   destruction of the beast, it is now our business to show.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SYNCHRONISM V.

   Of the Thousand Years of the august Kingdom of Christ, and of the
   Seventh Trumpet, or the Interval from the Destruction of the Beast.

   That extraordinary and august kingdom of Christ, repeatedly mentioned
   in the Apocalypse, and of whose approach the chorus of animated beings
   and elders rejoicing together, are wont to sing hymns and doxologies to
   God, every where succeeds to the beast and Babylon, subdued and led in
   triumph. For, first, in the 20th chapter, where this reign of a
   thousand years is expressly treated of, in the number of those who
   reign with Christ, are they who have not worshipped the beast, nor his
   image, nor received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands. Do
   not these words sufficiently show that this reign of Christ succeeded
   the reign of the beast, his image, and his marks? For why should this
   eulogium be bestowed on the children of the kingdom, that they had not
   adored the beast, &c. unless the beast had preceded it? For the good
   desert is certainly antecedent to the remuneration and reward. But this
   kingdom, (as the series of the narration points out) is bestowed on the
   saints as a reward of their faith and constancy, their cause having
   been first heard in solemn judgment; the assembly of which is described
   in these words, "And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and
   judgment was given unto them;" that is, the power of judging facts, &c.
   Therefore the time in which, while the beast was reigning, the saints
   approved their faith and their constancy to God, preceded the judgment.
   The remuneration follows the decree then established.

   2. The same likewise farther appears from the paean of the elders and
   living creatures, which was sung at the fall of Babylon: "Hallelou'ia,
   ?hoti ebasileuse Kurios? ?ho Theos ho pantokrator," v. 7. "Let us
   rejoice, and exult, and give glory to him; for the marriage of the Lamb
   is come, and his wife hath made herself ready." For that the kingdom in
   both cases is the same, I cannot entertain a doubt.

   3. But most clearly of all does it appear, from c. xi. v. 15, 16, &c.
   when, at the sound of the seventh trumpet, the days of the witnesses,
   and the months of the beast, and the Gentiles being concluded, there
   was that exclamation in heaven, "The kingdoms of this world are become
   the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever
   and ever. And the four and twenty elders who sat on their thrones
   before God, fell on their faces and worshipped God, saying, We give
   thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who art, and who vast, and who art to
   come, because Thou hast taken to Thee thy great power, and hast
   reigned."

   This is that consummation of the mystery of God, proclaimed by the
   prophets, which, at the sounding of the seventh trumpet, the angel had
   before predicted should come to pass; when neither the months of the
   beast, nor the days of the witnesses in mourning, nor any part of the
   period of "a time, and times, and half a time," should remain to be
   completed, precisely according to the prediction of Daniel, c. vii.
   v.25, 26. concerning the oecumenical dominion of Christ, or the reign
   of the saints, which was to take place after the same times and the
   same sessions of judgment. Likewise where the same angel who here
   addresses John, in the same gesture, manner, and (what is chiefly to be
   remarked) under the same form of swearing, is said to have asseverated
   that the interval of a time, and times, and half a time, being
   completed, the dispersion of the holy people, and with it, the last of
   wonderful events, should be consummated.

   Whoever desires a farther confirmation, let him apply the characters of
   the foregoing synchronism to the present; for they afford, as I have
   said, mutual corroboration to each other.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SYNCHRONISM VI.

   Of the New Jerusalem, the Spouse of the Lamb, with the Seventh Trumpet,
   or the Period from the Destruction of the Beast.

   The marriage of the Lamb, and the august kingdom of the Lord God
   Omnipotent, both begin from the fall of Babylon, from whence the
   seventh trumpet begins. This appears from the hymn of the elders and
   living creatures, which are quoted in the former synchronism, c. xix.
   v. 6, 7. "Alleluia! for our Lord God Omnipotent has begun to reign. Let
   us be glad, and rejoice, and give glory to Him; for the marriage of the
   Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready." But the "new
   Jerusalem is the spouse of the Lamb, adorned and prepared for her
   husband," c. xxi. v. 2. "And I saw," says he, "the Holy City, New
   Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, as a wife adorned for
   her husband;" and, v. 9, "Come, and I will show you, the bride, the
   Lamb's wife." Therefore, it will both begin and be contemporary with
   the seventh trumpet.

   2. New Jerusalem is the beloved city; but that beloved city, as soon as
   the thousand years are finished, is said to be compassed out by the.
   last forces of Satan, then set at liberty. c. xx. v. 9. "And they
   compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city."
   Therefore it must have existed before, while Satan was bound. To these
   two arguments, either for the sake of confirmation, or of illustration
   and ornament, two others seem proper to be subjoined.

   3. As soon as the seventh phial has been poured out, "a great voice
   proceeded from the Throne, saying, Gegone, It is done, c. xvi. 19. In
   like manner, c. xxi. v. 5, 6. "He who sat on the Throne" said to John,
   as he saw the New Jerusalem descending from heaven, "Behold, I make all
   things new. Gegone, It is done. I am A and O, the Beginning and the
   End." Therefore the new Jerusalem, the wife of the Lamb, begins from
   the final termination of the phials: "It is done," the harlot being now
   extinct, and so is contemporary with the interval from the destruction
   of the beast.

   4. One of the angels of the phials, c. xvii. showed John the judgment
   of the harlot, while the phials were pouring out, and which was to be
   effected by one of them at least; and the same angel of the c. xxi. v.
   10. shows the same John the bride of the Lamb, the great and holy city
   Jerusalem; because it was to become conspicuous when the phials were
   discharged, that is, when the beast and Babylon were extinct.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SYNCHRONISM VII.

   Of the Palm-bearing Multitude of Persons innumerable, rejoicing in
   triumph, out of all nations, and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues;
   with the Seventh Trumpet, or Period after the Destruction of the Beast.

   I. The palm-bearing multitude immediately succeeds the company of a
   hundred and forty-four thousand sealed; but that company which is to be
   considered as the opposite to the beast, with which it is contemporary,
   both in meaning and duration, completed its period likewise with the
   beast. (Synch. IV. Part. I.) Therefore the palm-bearing multitude
   follows both, and consequently falls in with the seventh trumpet, which
   is the interval from the downfal of the beast.

   The palm-bearing multitude are citizens of the new Jerusalem; for of
   both it is said, "that they shall not hunger any more, nor thirst any
   more; that the Lamb shall feed them, and lead them to living fountains
   of waters; and that God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes."

   Now, the new Jerusalem is contemporary with the seventh trumpet, and
   therefore the palm-bearing multitude is so likewise.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE EPOCH OF THE APOCALYPSE.

   The epoch of the Apocalypse, as far as it is a prophecy of the future,
   whether you are inclined to consider it as commencing from the
   beginning of Christianity, or from the ruin of the Jewish polity and
   church, or from the moment of time in which the revelation was made to
   St. John, or in whatever way it may be understood, (for I will not act
   as an interpreter, when I recollect my design,) I think no one will be
   inclined to doubt but that the beginning of the seals, which relates to
   things to be transacted therein, must be deduced from thence. But from
   the same epoch must be derived also the beginning of the second
   prophecy, or of the Little Book, if those words of the context, about
   the repetition of the prophecy, and what we have besides treated of
   above in Synch. VI. Part I. and in the Introduction to Part II. have
   not been sufficiently convincing to any individual, he will be
   compelled at length to acknowledge, from the necessity of the
   synchronism, when he shall have attempted to place the several
   prophecies in order and method according to the explanations which have
   just been made.

THE CLOSE OF THE SYNCHRONISMS AND OF THE APOCALYPSE.

   The universal resurrection of the dead, and the last judgment with
   Gehenna follow the thousand years of the kingdom and the condemnation
   of Satan, c. xx. from verse 11 to the end.

   Paradise follows the description of New Jerusalem, through which runs a
   river like Eden, winds about here and there, having in the midst

   [page 46 is missing]

   be extracted, compared, and demonstrated, with the supposition and
   assistance of any given interpretation.

   2. Then, besides, as it is the custom in historical works, that many
   different transactions which took place together and at the same time,
   with many other transactions, cannot, notwithstanding, be related
   together, but separately and in succession; so likewise it is usual, in
   the case of those prophecies and visions of things performed, (but
   displayed in the most commodious and wisest order,) that they would be
   altogether in the wrong who would proceed to interpret the Apocalypse
   in such a manner, as if the events succeeded each other always in the
   same order and series as the visions.

   3. By successfully examining the meaning of the Apocalyptical visions,
   the series and connexion in the chief of them among each other,
   according to the events, being investigated by remarkable characters
   and marks, and demonstrated by internal arguments, is to be constituted
   as the basis and foundation of all solid and legitimate interpretation.
   For the order itself is to be confirmed, not according to the will of
   the interpreter, (as we see unadvisedly done by many,) on account of
   some congruity of the interpretation, but every interpretation is to be
   tried by the characters of the synchronisms, according to the already
   constructed idea of this chronic order, as by a rule and standard. For
   without a foundation of this kind, it is scarcely possible that you
   should extract any thing from the Apocalypse which can solidly give an
   assurance of its interpretation and application, and which may rely on
   Divine authority, and not on assumed principles and mere conjectures.
   But, on the contrary, if this foundation be admitted, since even the
   bounds of time and order will not permit the application to wander at
   licence and at will, you will be surprised, out of so many varying and
   even contending interpretations, how many are almost entirely removed,
   few doubtful places, upon the whole, being left, and those generally of
   small consequence, in which the intention yet remains doubtful, at
   least as to its general application; so that from this book henceforth,
   as well as from the other books of the New Testament, arguments may be
   obtained, even on the subject of prophecy, secure of interpretation,
   and on which reliance may be placed as on the oracles of the Holy
   Spirit, and not merely on the inventions of the human understanding.

   5. Now, O Reader, such an Apocalyptical Key, or Compass, (if you prefer
   calling it so,) according to the measure of intelligence with which a
   good and beneficent God has favoured me, an unworthy sinner, in the
   investigation of these mysteries, I demonstrate to the best of my power
   in the above synchronisms, and propose to your view in the accompanying
   scheme, as in a brief and easy compendium; in which, (that you may not
   be ignorant of its use,) if you have once made up your mind about the
   sense of some principal prophecy, and of the times in which it was
   fulfilled, you will then have a method pointed out, from which, by the
   clew of the synchronisms, and the order of the whole, you will be able
   to investigate, nay, even to demonstrate, the meaning of the other
   visions; since those other prophecies which are contemporary with that
   known prophecy of yours, are without doubt to be applied to the same
   times; but those which precede are only to be interpreted of preceding,
   those which succeed in like manner, only of subsequent events.

   6. And lest you should be inclined to doubt whether there is any one of
   all the visions in the Apocalypse to be found on which you can safely
   fix your foot, in the manner I have pointed out, and from thence, as
   from some station or watch-tower, measure the rest of the Apocalypse,
   lo! on this very point a discovery has been made by the Holy Spirit, in
   that illustrious vision of the great harlot; in truth, the only one of
   all the visions which the angel, contrary to custom, explains to John.
   But for what purpose? unless that by it an approach may be opened to
   the rest, which would be otherwise inaccessible?

   What would you wish for more? Here then, having invoked the Father of
   Lights, enter; and having entered, apply the key to unlock the
   remainder. Make a trial; and when you have tried, you will confess that
   this prophecy is most admirable, and that when the subject is
   thoroughly investigated, there is none of the Old Testament, not even
   that of Daniel, (so it becomes the Gospel,) which can be compared with
   it for certainty, either in the singular contrivance of its
   manifestation, or in the mode and manner of discovering its
   interpretation.

   Lastly, I will intreat of you, O Reader, who may meet with this work,
   that if you shall perceive any thing perchance to have been revealed to
   me, while an attentive observer, which may be of service to yourself or
   others, in the understanding of these mysteries, you would refer it
   wholly to the mercy of God, bestowed upon me; to whom I likewise shall
   never cease to return my grateful thanks for the slenderest raylet of
   His wisdom; but whatever may be erroneous, that I beseech you to impute
   to myself alone, a man of very little ability, and by no means fitted
   of myself (of which I am fully conscious) to such an undertaking.

   Blessing, and honour, and glory be unto Him that sitteth on the Throne,
   and to the Lamb, for ever and ever!

   THE FIRST PART

   Of the Apocalyptical Commentaries, according to the Rule of the
   Apocalyptical Key, on the First Prophecy which is contained in the
   Seals and Trumpets; with an Introduction concerning the Scene of the
   Apocalypse.

   As it is my design to investigate the meaning of the Apocalyptical
   visions, it is requisite for me to treat, in the first place, of that
   celestial theatre to which John was called, in order to behold them,
   exhibited as on a stage, and afterwards of the prophecies in
   succession, examined by the Apocalyptical Key.

   O Christ! the Wisdom of God! to whom "the Revelation was given by the
   Father, to show unto us his servants things which must come to pass,"
   illuminate my mind with Thy bright beams, cleanse me from impurity by
   Thy blood. Grant me, with Thy assistance, and with the Spirit for my
   guide, to investigate these abstruse mysteries, and to explain them to
   others!

   I give the name of Apocalyptical theatre to that august session of God
   and the Church, described in the fourth chapter, and exactly
   conformable to the type of the ancient encampment of Israel in the
   desert, which will be fully manifest on comparing the disposition of
   one with the other. Thus, in the midst of the camp of Israel, was
   placed the tabernacle. The Levites were stationed nearest the camp; and
   after the Levites, to the four quarters of the world, the rest of the
   assembly of Israel, marshalled under four standards, three tribes being
   disposed under one standard, and receiving its name from the first
   tribe of its cohort. Each standard exhibited a signal, which, though
   Moses only mentions in a general manner, and does not always express
   what figure was inscribed on each standard, yet the Hebrews, from the
   ancient traditions of their elders, (in this instance not rashly to be
   despised,) proceed to the description of the whole in the following
   manner:--

   On the east was the standard of Judah, with his associate tribes, under
   the sign of a Lion.

   On the west the standard of Ephraim, under the sign of an Ox.

   On the south that of Reuben, under the sign of a Man.

   On the north that of Dan, under the sign of an Eagle.

   Aben Ezra observes on Numbers ii. 'tdr qkvnykr. Our ancestors have
   said, that there was the figure of a man on the standard of Reuben, on
   account of the mandrakes which he found, (but this is a foolish
   observation). On the standard of Judah the figure of a lion, because
   Jacob compared him to one. On the standard of Ephraim the figure of an
   ox, with reference to what is said, Deut. c. xxxiii. v. 17. "The
   firstling of his bullock." And lastly, on the standard of Dan the
   figure of an eagle. Bar Nachman, and Chuzkuni in his third chapter,
   have the same observations on this subject.

   If any one should be very curious to inquire on what account the
   figures of these animals were selected for this purpose, besides what
   may be deduced, not improperly, from the blessing of Judah and Ephraim,
   the writers on the Talmud seem to intimate a reason of this nature.
   There are four proud ones, (say they,) or those who bear pre-eminence
   in the world; the lion among the wild beasts, the ox among cattle, the
   eagle among birds, and man, upon whom God bestowed super-eminent
   beauty, that he might rule over all. Whatever the reason may be, this
   tradition of the Jews may be confirmed by the quadruple face of the
   cherubim, in Ezekiel, (for do not imagine there were so many heads,) by
   which was signified, that he who was carried by them was the Lord and
   King of the four cohorts, or camps of Israel. For as the chariots of
   princes are emblazoned with the ensigns of their lords, so are the
   cherubim with the signs of Jehovah, King of the Tetrarchs of Israel.

   Nor would it be very difficult to collect, from the position of
   Ezekiel, and the cherubim in that vision, with respect to each other,
   to which quarter of the world each face of the cherubim was directed:
   For when Ezekiel, with his countenance turned to the north, saw the
   cherubim, as it were, coming forth to meet him, undoubtedly that which
   then appeared before him was the anterior and direct face of the
   cherubim, namely, that of a man, and consequently the face of the man
   looked towards the south: Whence it follows, that what is said to have
   been on the right hand of Ezekiel, the face of the lion, looked towards
   the east, that of the ox, which was on his left hand, looked towards
   the west; and lastly, that of the eagle towards the north.

   And the same reason induces us to believe that those cherubim which
   overshadowed the ark of God, in the recess of the temple, were of a
   similar, that is, of a quadriform face, especially, since it may be
   proved, that this was the fact with regard to those which were engraven
   on the walls of the temple; because in the same prophet, c. xli. v. 19,
   we read of half their sculpture, when two faces, as must have been the
   case in bas-relief of this kind, being buried in the plane of the wait,
   the two remaining ones, those of the man and the lion, are represented
   as having stood forward, in opposite directions, towards the palms
   embossed on each side. And permit me to ask, why should the cherubim
   have been sculptured in any other form than that in which they were
   exhibited? We may add, that some understand of the four animals, as so
   many ensigns of the cohorts of Israel, a passage of Psalm lxviii. v.
   10, which, indeed, Jerome, in that version which has its reputation
   from its conformity with the Hebrew verity, has thus translated: "Thy
   animals have dwelt therein;" that is to say, according to what precedes
   it, "in thy inheritance;" i. e. the camp of thy people, whom thou
   leddest through the wilderness. In like manner, the Septuagint, and the
   Vulgate, which is translated from it, have ta zoa sou, animalia tua;
   and, in truth, that this passage refers to that time, plainly appears
   from what is antecedent to this and the preceding verse. "O God! when
   thou wentest out before thy people; when thou wentest through the
   wilderness; the earth trembled and the heavens dropped at the presence
   of God," &c. And also what is subjoined of "the gracious rain," the
   rain of manna, if I am not mistaken, and therefore it may be rendered,
   "A gracious or liberal rain hast thou shed, O God! with which thou hast
   comforted thy labouring inheritance." Not to say, besides, that the
   beginning of this psalm is borrowed from that form of prayer which
   Moses used at the going out of the people of Israel, "Rise, O Jehovah!
   and let thy enemies be scattered!"

   We have seen the Israelitish encampment of God: Now let us see how the
   Apocalyptic Assembly conforms to it in every respect. c. iv. v. 2. "And
   I was (says John) in the Spirit, and behold a throne was set in heaven;
   and there was One sitting on the throne. And He that sat thereon was to
   look at like a jasper and a sardine stone, like the appearance of an
   emerald; and around the throne were four-and-twenty seats, and upon the
   seats I saw four-and-twenty elders sitting, clothed in white garments,
   and they had on their heads golden crowns. And out of the throne
   proceeded lightnings, and thunderings, and voices; and there were seven
   lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of
   God. And before the throne was a sea of glass, like unto chrystal, and
   in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four
   animals, full of eyes before and behind; and the first animal was like
   a lion, and the second animal like a calf, and the third animal had a
   lace as a man, and the fourth animal was like a flying eagle. And the
   four animals had each of them six wings round about him, and were full
   of eyes within, and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy,
   holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and which is, and which is to come!
   And when those animals give glory and honour and thanks to Him who is
   sitting on the throne, and who liveth for ever and ever, the
   four-and-twenty elders fall down before Him who sitteth on the throne,
   and worship Him who liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns
   before the throne, saying, Worthy art thou, O Lord, to receive glory,
   and honour, and power, for thou hast created all things, and through
   thy will they are, and were created!"

   Do not these particulars answer exactly to each other? First, as to the
   tabernacle: That the throne here placed in the midst, on which God was
   sitting, was no other than the temple, or tabernacle, (for it must be
   observed, that the description is applicable to the history of both,)
   appears both from the seven lamps burning before it, and from the
   glassy sea, like chrystal, of which the former represent the
   candlestick with its seven lights, likewise burning before the sacred
   place; the latter that immense laver in the Temple of Solomon, called
   the sea; but with this difference, that that of Solomon was brass, but
   ours of glassy or pellucid substance.

   I know not, however, whether we may not be allowed to conjecture that
   an allusion is here made to that more ancient laver of the Mosaic
   tabernacle, since that also is reported to have been constructed of
   looking-glass, of I know not what substance; viz. of the
   looking-glasses of the women assembling at the door of the tabernacle.
   But you may see the temple remarkably described under the title of the
   throne of God. Is. vi. 1. "I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, lofty
   and elevated, and its skirts filled the temple." So also Jerem. xvii.
   12. "A throne of glory from the beginning is the place of our
   sanctuary." And Ezekiel, xliii. 7. "The place of my throne, and the
   place of my footsteps, where I dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel
   for ever."

   And that it was a throne of this kind, which John saw placed in the
   midst of the elders and living creatures, the Apocalypse has every
   where taken for granted. For where did he see the altar openly, "and
   under it the souls of those who were slain for the Word of God," except
   in the temple? How could the golden altar of incense be before the
   throne, unless that throne were a temple or a tabernacle? What else
   will "the four horns of the golden altar" imply, which is in the sight
   of God? What is meant by the temple, the courts of the temple, and the
   altar, as well those which were to be measured by the reed of the
   angel, as those which were to be left out? What the temple of God
   opened in heaven, and therein the ark of the testimony exposed to view?
   What the angels coming forth from the temple, and that also in heaven?
   What is meant by the harpers standing on the brink of the sea, or
   glassy laver, and singing the song of victory, and that likewise in
   heaven? What in the fifth verse of the same chapter, of the temple of
   the tabernacle of testimony opened in heaven? and of the same temple
   "filled with smoke from the glory of God?" But what places the matter
   beyond all chance of contradiction is, "And there came forth a great
   voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne."

   Moreover, in this throne or temple, lest any doubt should remain, the
   place of God's seat, (or, as the Greek interpreters speak of the throne
   of Solomon,) a ho thronos tes kathedras, the throne of his
   resting-place, was that interior and most holy part of the temple,
   where the ark of the covenant was enclosed with the mercy-seat. For
   there God was said to dwell, and sit between the cherubim of glory: For
   which reason, indeed, both the seven lamps in this place, and the
   golden altar of incense afterwards, are said to have been "before the
   throne;" that is, before the inmost recess of the temple; for that is
   plainly said of both in so many words, 2 Chron. iv. and 1 Kings vi. 20,
   in the former of which the Septuagint has, "tous luchnous kata to
   prosopon tou dabeir;" i. e. the lamps before the face of the Dabir [4]
   , (for so the inmost recess is called in Hebrew;) in the other place,
   "Thusiasterion kedrinon, kata prosopon tou dabeir," "the cedar altar of
   incense before the face of the Dabir;" nearly in the same sense as in
   the Apocalypse, "before the throne and before God." So the remaining
   parts, both of the temple and tabernacle, will consist partly of props,
   partly of steps, and partly of a footstool to the throne properly so
   called, of which kind that august throne of Solomon is said to have had
   parts or appendages. Thus far respecting the throne.

   2. Four-and-twenty elders, in the next place, surround the throne, who
   represent the bishops and prelates of the churches, and answer in place
   and order to the Levites and priests in the camp of Israel, and their
   number twenty-four corresponds with the daily courses of the priests
   and Levites, or, what comes to the same result, with the chiefs of the
   daily courses. Whence beside that they are next to God, they have
   likewise their thrones there: Moreover, they wear crowns, which are
   marks of dignity and power bestowed by God.

   3. At a proper distance behind the elders, where lines drawn through
   the middle of the throne bisect its sides on every part of the
   circumference, towards the four cardinal points of heaven, four living
   creatures were seen; the first in the figure of a lion, the second of
   an ox, (for moschos is an ox with the Hellenists,) the third in the
   likeness of a man, the fourth of a flying eagle, representing doubtless
   the Christian churches towards the four parts of the world, and
   answering to the four Israelitish camps, which bore standards of the
   same animals. For what is called in the Apocalyptic text, a little
   obscurely, "in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne,"
   may be explained by the figure hen dia duoin; i. e. one through two;
   familiar to the Hebrews, as if it had been said, in the midst of the
   circuit or circumference of the throne; and in this sense, if you were
   to draw round the throne, as a square, a quadrangular parallel figure
   at a proper distance from the throne, and the elders surrounding it, in
   the midst, or at the middle of every one of the sides of the
   quadrangle, (for en meso, in the midst, is to be taken distributively,)
   the four animals exhibited themselves, namely, one in the middle of
   each side.

   Figure of the Throne

   Moreover, those animals are described as "full of eyes before and
   behind," having six wings around them, and those full of eyes within.
   So many eyes denote a multitude of very well-sighted persons, and full
   of the knowledge of the mysteries of God, of which kind there are many
   in the animals, that is, in the churches which the animals represent.
   The wings denote agility and alacrity in executing the commands of God.
   Wings with eyes denote zeal combined with knowledge and faith. Lastly,
   six wings around them, denote that they are ready to fly every way,
   that is, fully prepared to fulfil the commands of God universally and
   entirely. In addition we are told, lastly, what was the nature of their
   duty, as well that of the living creatures, as of the elders around the
   throne, namely, of this kind, that "as often as those animated beings
   were about to give glory, and honour, and thanks to Him that sat on the
   throne;" i. e. as often as the churches formed their holy
   congregations, so often "the four-and-twenty elders, in right of their
   office preceding the animated beings, are accustomed to "fall down
   before God," saying, "Worthy art Thou, O Lord, to receive glory, and
   honour, and power; for Thou hast created all things, and for thy
   pleasure they are and were created." This interpretation being
   admitted, the diction of John, which many pretend to be a solecism, as
   improperly using the futures, dosousi, pesountai, proskunesousi,
   instead of the preterites, will easily be defended; since, according to
   the Hebrews, (whose ideas the apostle every where adopts,) the future
   is used to denote an act of custom or duty, so that John is by no means
   to be supposed to relate what was there done in the vision, by the
   animated beings and elders, but what was to be done as occasion should
   arise, and what he himself saw clone by them afterwards, in the
   progress of the visions when an opportunity occurred of celebrating
   God.

   And therefore (that I may at length come to a conclusion) I think I
   have clearly shown, that the throne in this august session answers to
   the tabernacle or temple; the elders answer to the Levites; the four
   animals to the four Israelitish camps; that is, that the whole
   assemblage is the image of that ancient castrametation in the
   wilderness. Which subject has indeed been more diffusively treated of
   by me, because I have observed that the reason of many types in the
   Apocalypse depends chiefly on the knowledge of this, which I doubt not
   but every one who has thoroughly investigated the matter, will perceive
   as well as myself.

   The theatre being thus prepared, He who sat on the throne stretches
   forth a book in his right hand, written upon, both in the inside and
   the out, and fastened with seven seals, and an angel at the same time
   coming forth on the scene, proclaims, with a loud voice, that if to any
   one were given the power of opening it, so that the things which were
   written therein might be seen and read, he should take it into his
   hands and apply himself to the task; and in so doing, would perform an
   office very acceptable to all who were ardent in the study of
   mysteries.

   And the book was in truth most worthy of the effort; in the unsealing
   of which, any one would exert all the powers of his understanding and
   industry, inasmuch as the volume was predictive of the counsels of God,
   in which was interwoven the series and order of events, to be
   transacted up to the second and glorious advent of Christ.

   For, of this nature evidently appears to be the double prophecy of the
   future, which the volume contained. Which is the reason, unless I am
   mistaken, why John, when he was preparing to expound the visions,
   prefixed to the beginning of his history the descriptive outline of his
   glorious advent, as the boundary of the Apocalyptic course. "Behold
   (says he) he cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they
   also that pierced him, and all the tribes of the earth shall lament
   because of him." As much as to say, this is the scope, this the
   boundary of the visions which I shall relate.

   But when "no one of those who were in heaven, or in the earth, or under
   the earth, was able to unseal the book," and the object seemed to be
   given up for lost, so that John, overcome with grief, burst into tears,
   lo, "a Lamb in appearance, as if it had been slain," that is, bearing
   the marks and wounds of one that had undergone death, arose in the
   midst of the elders and animated beings, and took the book, for the
   purpose of unsealing and opening it, as he alone had worthily obtained
   the power of doing it.

   At the sight of this a chorus of the animated beings and elders,
   together with the surrounding angels, and all the creatures in the
   universe, filled with gratitude, immediately sing a hymn to the Lamb
   and to the Father. On which subject I desire only to remark at present,
   that they manifestly refer the power of unsealing the book as obtained
   by the merit of the passion of the Lamb. "Worthy art thou (they say) to
   open the book and its seals, for thou wert slain, and hast redeemed us
   to God by thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and
   nation." By which, perhaps, light may be thrown on that saying of our
   Saviour before he had suffered and been glorified: "But of that day and
   hour (alluding to his second coming, whether it would be sooner or
   later) knoweth no one, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but
   the Father only;" because the Apocalypse was not yet given to Christ by
   the Father, nor the order of events relating to his advent yet made
   known. I assert nothing rashly; let the reader weigh the matter with
   himself.

   While the Lamb is thus unsealing the book at each of the seals,
   particular images of future things are exhibited, of which the system
   runs through the whole Apocalyptical course, and thus constitutes the
   first universal prophecy. The interpretation of which, by the favour of
   Him who sitteth on the throne and of the Lamb, we will now attempt.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Of the two Apocalyptical Prophecies.

   The first prophecy, that of the seals, comprehends the fates of the
   empire: The other, that of the little book, the fates of the Church, or
   of the Christian Religion, until at length both shall coalesce in the
   reign of the Church triumphant, "when the kingdoms of this world have
   become the kingdoms of the Lord and his Christ." For as Daniel in the
   Old Testament, according to the succession of empires, both
   presignified the coming of Christ, and explained in order the fates of
   the Jewish Church; so is the Apocalypse to be understood as measuring
   out the Christian system by the proceedings of the Roman empire, which
   was still remaining after Christ. Nor does the event contradict this
   supposition. The interpretation of the first prophecy thus proceeds
   upon this general hypothesis.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Of the first Prophecy, which is that of the Seals; and in the first
   place, of the events signified by the six first Seals.

   The scope of the seven seals in general is this, that the periods of
   time, as it continues to flow, being distinguished by the characters of
   events, it may be shown, that when the succession of occurrences of
   every kind relative to the Roman empire has been contemplated, it would
   come to pass that Christ would vanquish the powers of the world with
   which he was waging war. In the sixth succession, or sixth seal, the
   gods of the heathen Roman empire; and in the seventh, when the series
   of the trumpets shall have arrived at the last trump, whatever, even
   after that time, might have arisen anew, or yet remain in any part of
   the world, was to be destroyed and abolished. "For he must reign until
   he bath put all enemies under his feet:" That is, till he has abolished
   all hostile principality, and power, and authority.

   We will treat of the former period, as the order requires, in the first
   place.

   The six first seals then, in their sixfold character of events, (not
   much unlike those which our Saviour had prescribed for pointing out the
   time of the ruin of Jerusalem,) distinguish so many periods of the
   Roman empire, while it was yet subsisting and flourishing, until, at
   length, in the sixth, Christ should utterly demolish the power of idols
   and heathen deities in that part of the globe. Now I call characters
   the very signal events of the Roman empire, by which occurrences, as in
   a symbol, the periods may be distinguished, and those in this first
   period, not brought on from without by the barbarous nations, (of which
   kind will be those of the empire afterwards falling to decay under the
   plagues of. the seven trumpets,) but intestine misfortunes, arising
   within the empire itself: Which destruction, indeed, was introduced by
   the Holy Spirit for this purpose, that the different times of the Roman
   commonwealth,--the former of its flourishing, the latter of its
   declining state,--may be described by different marks.

   It is here likewise to be observed, that since the characters of the
   occurrences, of which I have spoken, scarce ever or rarely pervade the
   whole period of the seal, and consequently may not be sufficient of
   themselves to circumscribe these periods within a certain beginning and
   end; therefore, in the four first seals, the Holy Spirit (where that
   may be most necessary, as well for the cause above mentioned as on
   account of the inequality of the periods) has had recourse to the four
   animated beings for that purpose, each of which might indicate the
   epoch of the seal according to his point of the compass. How this is
   done we shall presently see. It is sufficient at present to have given
   a hint of it. C. vi. "And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals,
   and I heard one of the four animated beings saying, as with a voice of
   thunder, Come and see. And I saw, and behold a white horse, and he that
   sat thereon held a bow, and a crown was given unto him, and he went
   forth conquering, and to conquer. And when he opened the second seal, I
   heard the second animated being saying, Come and see. And there went
   out another horse that was red [5] , and it was given to him that sat
   thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they might slay one
   another; and a great sword was given him. And when he opened the third
   seal, I heard the third animated being say, Come and see. And I beheld,
   and lo a black horse, and he that sat thereon had a balance in his
   hand: And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures,
   saying, A daily measure [6] of wheat for a penny, and three daily
   measures of barley for a penny; and hurt not the oil and the wine. And
   when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth
   animated being saying, Come and see. And I saw, and behold a pale [7]
   horse, and the name of him that sat thereon was Death, and Hades
   followed in his company; and power was given them to kill the fourth
   part of the earth with sword, and with famine, and with death, and by
   the wild beasts of the earth."

   Of the First Seal.

   The first occurrence of the Roman empire, and that a most illustrious
   one, is the commencement of the victory of Christ, by which the Roman
   gods began to be vanquished, and their worshippers to be transfixed
   with the arrows of the Gospel, to fail on every side, and to submit
   their necks to Christ the conqueror. "He went out (says he) conquering,
   and to conquer;" that is, he hath not yet completely conquered, but
   laid the foundations of victory, to he hereafter more and more
   fulfilled.

   The index of the first seal is the first animal in the likeness of a
   lion, in station towards the East, and it shows that the rider, viz.
   the emperor, is to go forth from that quarter of the compass, from the
   mounting of whom on his horse for the purpose of riding,--that is, from
   the beginning of his government,--the period of the first seal was to
   commence, namely, from the glorious exaltation of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, under the guidance and auspices of which emperor from the East,
   this battle is waged, and this victory obtained. The beginning of the
   following seals is pointed out by the Roman emperors; but where the act
   of Christ is described, he is accounted as the sole emperor [8] .

   Now indeed, when this seal had run its course, the oracles of the gods,
   through the whole Roman world, became mute, and John, the last of the
   twelve apostles of Christ, having received the wages of his warfare,
   departed from this life, to receive an undecaying crown in the heavens,
   together with his brethren and co-apostles, ibr a conduct bravely and
   happily performed.

   That riding on horseback is a symbol of power, and of those who hold
   the reins of government, may be seen even from the interpretation of
   the Greek translators, Psalm xlv. v. 5, according to whom, prosper and
   ride on, is rendered, kateuodou kai basileue, Go forth prosperously and
   reign. Nor does the Chaldee dissent from this sense, which translates,
   "as horsemen on the throne of the kingdom. So the woman riding on the
   beast is explained by the angel to be a city having dominion, and the
   expression of riding is applied in the same sense in other parts of
   Scripture.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [8] Here I must hesitate in agreeing with our learned author. After
   declaring, as he had just before done, that the seals related to the
   events connected with the Roman empire, he surely departs from his
   interpretation when he represents the object of the first seal as
   descriptive of Christ. Does not this destroy the consistency of the
   explanation? May it not refer to Vespasian or Titus? the former of whom
   was proclaimed emperor of Judea, and under whose auspices, Jerusalem
   was taken and destroyed, and the Jewish nation subdued. Tacitus, in
   recounting the general persuasion that had gone forth that the East
   should prevail, considers the prediction verified in Vespasian and
   Titus. The first illustrious rider was doubtless the conqueror of the
   Jews.--R. B. C. This was the opinion of our author at a later period,
   (V. p. 918.) and it has been the general exposition of subsequent
   commentators.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Of the Second Seal.

   The second memorable event of the Roman empire, the picture of the
   second seal, is slaughter and intestine butchery; to which there was
   scarcely any similar in the whole Roman history. "And it was given,"
   says he, "to him who sat on the horse to take away peace from the
   earth, and that men should massacre one another;" which last part of
   the sentence confirms the explanation of the former: For in what sense
   should the words be taken, "It was given to him that men should kill
   one another," unless it were given, or came to pass, that while he sat
   thereon, men should fiercely contend in mutual slaughters and
   butcheries? The index of this seal is the second animal, in the figure
   of an ox, situated to the west, and which bids them in the vision look
   towards himself: He thereby informs us, that this seal begins when
   Trajan, the Spaniard, had taken the reins of government, an emperor
   from the west. Dion says, Trajan, a Spaniard, was not an Italian, not
   belonging to Italy: Before him, no one of any other nation had obtained
   the Roman empire. But from him thenceforward the dominion continued in
   a descent from the same family down to Commodus, when the interval of
   this seal terminates.

   Beginning, then, from this emperor, let us seek for that memorable
   event of mutual slaughter. This took place when Trajan and his
   successor, Hadrian, held the ensigns of imperial sway, among the
   Gentiles and Jews who then dwelt together throughout the Roman world.
   What was done under Trajan, take not in my words, but in the joint
   expressions of Dion and Orosius. "The Jews," says Orosius, "were
   inflamed with an incredible agitation at one time, as if maddened by
   rage, through all parts of the earth: For they waged the most atrocious
   wars throughout the whole of Lybia, against the inhabitants; which was
   then so desolated, in consequence of the cultivators being killed, that
   it would have remained wholly void, every inhabitant being cut off, if
   Hadrian, the emperor, had not afterwards introduced colonies there,
   collected from other places."

   "Those who dwelt about Cyrene, (it is Dion who speaks,) under a certain
   leader of the name of Andrew, slew Romans as well as Greeks, fed upon
   their flesh, and ate their entrails [9] . They then smeared themselves
   with their blood, and put on their skins. They divided many from head
   to foot with saws, they cast many to the wild beasts, they compelled
   many to fight together; so that there perished about two hundred and
   twenty thousand souls." He proceeds: "Besides, a similar slaughter took
   place in Egypt and in Cyprus, under the direction of Artemion, where
   there perished also two hundred and forty thousand. They utterly
   destroyed Salamis, a city of Cyprus, having slain all the inhabitants.
   (Oros. Eus.) In Alexandria also, having stirred up a warfare, they were
   conquered and reduced. At length they were subdued by others, and
   principally by Lysias, whom Trajan sent against them. In Mesopotamia
   also, when they had rebelled, war was undertaken against them by the
   command of the emperor; and by these means, many thousands of them were
   destroyed with a very great slaughter."

   Thus far as to what passed under Trajan. But you will ask if there was
   any thing under Hadrian to be compared to these facts? Let the reader
   judge if they were not of a similar kind. I dare to affirm, not much
   inferior. For we have not yet related any thing of that famous
   rebellion under Barchoshebar, the pseudo Messiah. Listen to that, then,
   likewise in the words of Dion. "When Hadrian," says he, "had brought a
   colony into the city of Jerusalem, and in the same place in which the
   temple of God had been, had ordered another to be erected to Jupiter
   Capitolinus, all the Jews, wherever they were, began to mutiny, to
   inflict many injuries, secretly and openly, on the Romans, and many
   other nations were joined with them, from the desire of plunder; and by
   this means, almost the whole world was thrown into commotion." He goes
   on: "Then at length, Hadrian, after he had sent some of his best
   generals against them, (as their great number and desperation were well
   known,) not daring to attack them except singly, at length, after a
   long time, he overpowered and vanquished them, and there were slain, in
   these excursions and battles, not less than five hundred and eighty
   thousand persons. But so great was the multitude of those who died by
   famine, disease, and fire, that the number could not be ascertained."
   But was this victory easy and bloodless to the Romans? By no means. For
   he adds: "So many of the Romans perished in that war, that Hadrian,
   when he wrote to the Senate, did not use that exordium which the
   emperors were accustomed to adopt: Si vos liberique vestri valetis,
   bene est; Ego quidem et exercitus meus valemus.'"

   These are his observations concerning the commotion among the Jews,
   under that son of the Star, as they called him, or if you will, the son
   of Stellio, whom Eusebius also reports to have slain the Christians
   with all sorts of torments, who were unwilling to render him assistance
   against the Roman soldiers. But if any one is desirous of hearing how
   the Jews themselves estimate the slaughter of their nation, the author
   of the book Juchasin writes, that Hadrian butchered twice as many Jews
   in this war as went out of Egypt. Another, in the book which is
   intituled tlvydvvvy, which Drusius quotes in his History of Past
   Events, has said, that neither Nebuchadnezzar nor Titus had afflicted
   them so sorely as the emperor Hadrian.

   Therefore this destruction seems to have been the most grievous
   paroxysm of that unheard of tribulation, which our Saviour had
   predicted should befall the Jews, and, by consequence, not undeservedly
   selected by the Holy Spirit for marking this second period, beyond all
   the events of that time, since it exceeded them all, as well in the
   renown of the nation, as in this illustrious completion of prophecy.

   [9] Query.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Of the Third Seal.

   The third animated being is the index of the third seal, in a human
   form, his station being towards the south, and consequently shows that
   this seal begins with an emperor proceeding from that cardinal point of
   the compass; probably with Septimius Severus, the African, an emperor
   from the south, of whom Eutropius writes in the following manner:
   "Deriving his origin from Africa, from the province of Tripolis, from
   the town of Leptis, the only emperor from Africa within all
   remembrance, before or since."

   Many will have famine or dearness of provisions the subject of this
   seal, deducing their proof rather from the black colour of the horse,
   and from the mention of grain, a measure [10] of wheat for a penny, to
   which likewise they think the balance in the hands of the rider refers;
   as if the allowance of corn was not only to be measured, but weighed,
   in consequence of very great penury. And, in truth, I should never have
   called this interpretation in question, (which appears so suitable at
   first sight,) if the event had corresponded with it. But I find nothing
   particular in this age, and in this course of the seals concerning
   famine, and deserving the adoption of such a character: For what is
   reported from Tertullian, according to Scapula, is, I think, by no
   means to be considered as of much importance; for if, as he relates,
   the harvest failed once in Africa, when Hilarion was prefect, it was
   not on that account general through the Roman world, nor was it in the
   age of Severus. Hence, it comes to pass, that while I examine the
   meaning of the symbol a little more closely, I seem to myself to
   collect, and not altogether from uncertain signs, that it is to be
   regarded in a different light. For it does not appear, as that
   interpretation requires, that the balance can be aptly compared with
   the choenix, since the libra or scale is used in weighing, but choenix
   is the name of a measure. Besides, when the condition of the animal
   indicated agrees so well with the signification of the other
   seals,--that of the lion with victory, that of the ox with slaughter,
   that of the eagle with the carcases of the following seal,--here there
   would be no ground for the association. For what agreement is there
   between man and famine? The colour of black, neither in its nature nor
   in the use of the ancient prophets, is coupled with famine only, but
   serves equally to describe sorrow, misery, and terror.

   The subject of this seal, therefore, may be not famine, nor the
   dearness of provisions, but an administration of justice throughout the
   Roman world, and a severity more illustrious and more remarkable than
   in any of the former or subsequent periods of the seals. For as relates
   to the figure, the colour of the horse agrees with the severity of
   justice. That the scales are the symbol of Justice, is a fact handed
   down to us, as at this day no one is ignorant that Justice is painted
   with a balance. But what is subjoined by way of explanation, will
   appear, if attention is paid to it, to imply the same. "Take not away
   wheat or barley from any without a just price being paid for it.
   Observe a similar rule of justice also with regard to the oil and the
   wine;" as if he wished to caution them against plunderers, and had
   said, Do not steal. A denary, or penny, was the ordinary wages for a
   day's work, which is obvious from the Gospel; it was also the daily
   stipend of the soldiers. The choenix signifies the diurnal allowance,
   the hemerotrophida, the food for the day, but of a very uncertain
   measure, for it varied according to the custom of nations, places, and
   men. The military choenix (to omit the minor choenices of shepherds,
   husbandmen, and vintagers) was four quarts; but in an ancient
   lexicographer in Greek and Latin, choinix is half a bushel, i. e.
   double the military: And in the Septuagint, Ezek. xlv. 10, 11, choinix
   is a bath, the largest measure of the Hebrews. From so uncertain a
   measure as the chænix, how is it possible that any thing should be
   extorted concerning famine and the dearness of provisions? A chcenix,
   therefore, I take here for any diurnal allowance, and a denary for any
   price of such allowance. In this manner the mode of interpretation
   which I have adopted will be established.

   Now it is wonderful how much the event favours the interpretation,
   while Severus and Alexander were in power, those very distinguished
   riders on the black horse. Of Severus, what you may read at large in
   Aurelius, I will collect together, retaining the author's words, and I
   will do the same afterwards from Lamprideus concerning Alexander. "No
   one was more illustrious in the republic," says Aurelius, "than
   Severus, the founder of very equitable laws. Implacable to faults, he
   exalted every active person by rewards. He permitted honours to be sold
   to no one within his dominions. Nor did he suffer the smallest theft to
   go unpunished; animadverting more particularly on his own dependants,
   because, though difficult of proof, he understood that they took place
   through the fault of his generals, or even of his prefects." Spartianus
   agrees with Aurelius when he calls him "both implacable to faults and
   the enemy to thieves, whenever they were found." But these assertions
   were in no respect inferior to those which Lampridius relates of
   Alexander, the son of Mammea, on which, therefore, the chief part of
   the character of the seal appears to be founded. "He enacted," says he,
   "moderate and innumerable laws on the right of the people and the
   revenue, nor did he ever sanction any constitution without twenty
   lawyers. He was a most severe judge against thieves, accusing them as
   guilty of daily crimes, and condemning them with the greatest acrimony,
   and calling them the only foes and enemies of the republic, (hut he
   speaks, if I mistake not, of judges who were thieves,) he commanded
   them never to appear in the cities, and if they were seen, to be
   banished by the governors of provinces. "Eucolpius," says he, "relates,
   (with whom he was on the most familiar terms,) that if ever he saw a
   judge who was a thief; he had his finger ready to pluck out his eye.
   Septimius adds, who was no stranger to his mode of life, that Alexander
   had so much animosity against those judges, who had a bad reputation
   from their successors, that if he saw them by any accident from the
   penetration of his mind, he blurted out the fervour of his indignation,
   his whole countenance glowing with wrath, so that he could not
   articulate. Nay, he caused it to be proclaimed by a herald, that no one
   should salute the prince who knew himself to be a thief, but if he
   should ever be detected, he should become liable to capital punishment.
   He proceeds: "If any of the soldiers turned out of their way into the
   property of any one, according to the nature of the place, he was
   subjected in his presence, either to be beaten with clubs or rods, or
   to be condemned; or if the dignity of the person secured him from these
   punishments, he was visited with the severest reproaches, since he
   addressed him thus: `Will you have that done on your own land which you
   do on another's?' and he very often exclaimed what he had heard and
   remembered, either from certain Jews or Christians, What you would not
   wish to have done to yourself, do not to another:' With which sentence
   he was so much in love, that he ordered it to be inscribed on his
   palace and on public buildings."

   Behold, O Reader, the rider on the black horse, magnificently holding
   that golden heaven-descended balance of justice on the theatre of the
   world! Which was so remarkable a circumstance in a Pagan emperor, that
   it ought not to be deemed wonderful that the Holy Spirit should have
   made an allusion to it in this place.

   Another mode of interpreting the symbol of Wheat and Barley.

   It is possible that these allusions to wheat and barley may be
   understood of the remarkable supply of corn which took place in these
   times. For it may seem that this meaning also is included in those
   words: So it may have a reference to the abundance of grain, that
   provisions should be sold at a just price. "A measure of wheat for a
   penny:" i. e. Sell the daily allowance of wheat according to the daily
   price of labour, or the wages or rent, that they might not furnish to
   any one who required assistance, more daily food than was sufficient
   for his daily supply. So likewise, "three measures of barley for a
   penny," may seem to relate to an equation of price, according to the
   quality of the commodity. If an interpretation of this sort should be
   satisfactory, the event will here also correspond exactly with it.
   Spartian says of Severus, "Though he found very little grain, he took
   such care, that when he departed this life, he left a seven years'
   regular allowance to the Roman people, so that 70,000 bushels a day
   might be expended. He first bestowed on the people of Rome a gratuitous
   diurnal allowance of oil, but he left so much of it, that there was
   sufficient for five years, not only for the uses of the city, but of
   all Italy, which was in want of oil." As if indeed he had intended to
   fulfil what is here added, kai to elaion kai ton oinon me adikeses,
   "And be not unjust as to the oil and wine."

   Lamprideus has similar remarks respecting Alexander. "He so assisted,"
   says he, "the provision of the Roman people, that when Heliogabalus had
   destroyed the grain, he in his turn replaced it out of his own revenue.
   The oil likewise," said he, "which Severus had given to the people, and
   which Heliogabalus had diminished, he fully restored, and added oil for
   the lights of the baths [11] ."

   Of the Fourth Seal.

   The index of the fourth seal is the fourth animal, in the likeness of
   an eagle, its station to the North; by which is shown, that the
   beginning of the seal is to be deduced from an emperor sprung from that
   quarter, namely, from Maximin the Thracian, a nursling of the North.
   Julius Capitolinus says, "Maximin, of a village of Thrace, near the
   Barbarians, born also of a Barbarian father and mother." The character
   of this seal is an assemblage of sword, famine, and pestilence, raging
   together in such a manner as was never known before. Whence, to him who
   sat on the horse, the name of Death is said to be given; that is, in
   the acceptation of the notion of the Hebrews, who use abstracts for
   concretes, meaning deadly or death-bearing, because he brought in so
   many deaths with him into the world. For among the Hebrews, to be
   called by a name, sometimes signifies the same as to be, or exist, but
   in a certain particular manner, so that to have the name of Death in
   this place, means nothing else than to be, in an especial manner,
   deadly, or the cause of death; to which purpose likewise is that which
   follows, namely, that Hell accompanies him, as an attendant on
   funerals.

   Now let us look to the event. And never, in truth, from the beginning
   of the seals, have these three plagues raged conjointly in so singular
   a manner. I will begin with slaughter, and omit what this age underwent
   from an external enemy, though that was very severe, the Barbarians
   laying waste almost the whole of the empire under the emperors Gallus
   and Volusianus, with rapines and slaughters. These things are not taken
   into the account. We are inquiring into intestine and domestic affairs.
   Ten emperors and Cesars then, or thereabouts, who were accounted
   legitimate, within the interval of this seal, i. e. within the space of
   thirty-three years, or a little more, did the sword, not of enemies,
   but of their own subjects, take off. Throughout the same interval,
   under the government of Gallienus alone, those thirty tyrants of whom
   Polio speaks, (though there might be fewer by one or two,) sprung up in
   different parts of the Roman world; and almost all these were slain,
   either by their own people or by one another, or were butchered by
   legitimate emperors; so that Orosius has said not undeservedly of this
   plague, that it was signalised, not by the slaughter of the common
   people, but by the wounds and deaths of princes.

   Lastly, those emperors, beginning with Maxi-min and ending with
   Gallienus, with what savage cruelty were they endued! Maximin, as
   Julius Capitolinus testifies, was so cruel, "that some denominated him
   Cyclops, others Busiris, others Sciro, some Phalaris, and many Typho
   and Gyges. The senate feared him so much, that even their wives and
   children offered up prayers in the temples, publicly and privately,
   that he might never see the city of Rome. For they heard that some were
   lifted up on crosses, some enclosed in animals lately killed, some
   thrown to wild beasts, sonic beaten with clubs, and all without respect
   to dignity of situation." He proceeds: "In order to hide his ignoble
   birth, he killed all who were acquainted with his family, and also
   sonic friends who had often given him many donations from motives of
   pity and piety, for there was not a more cruel animal on the face of
   the earth." Lastly, says he, "Without judgment, without accusation,
   without an informer, without defence, he slew all of the faction of one
   Magnus, a consular man, took away all their goods, and could not
   satisfy himself with the slaughter of more than 4000 persons. Hear also
   what Trebellius Pollio says of Gallienus, in his Book of the Thirty
   Tyrants. "Ingenuus being slain, who was called Emperor by the legion in
   Mæsia, he was bitterly enraged against the soldiers as well as the
   citizens, nor did he leave any one without some mark of his cruelty. He
   was so fierce and blood-thirsty, that he left most of the cities void
   of the male sex." The same writer, in the Life of Gallienus, says: "The
   Scythians, having invaded Cappadocia, the soldiers had again
   entertained thoughts of making a new emperor, all of whom Gallienus
   slew according to his custom." He adds, in conclusion: "He acted with
   excessive cruelty towards the soldiers; for he slew three or four
   thousand every day." Pollio likewise relates, in the same Life of
   Gallienus, the very memorable example of the Byzantine butchery,
   exhibited by the soldiers, and by Gallienus himself: "Lest any evil,"
   says he, should be wanting in the time of Gallienus, the city of the
   Byzantines, illustrious for naval battles, and the key of the Pontic
   sea, was so wholly laid waste by the soldiers of Gallienus, that
   scarcely any remained alive; for vengeance on whose slaughter, when
   Gallienus was admitted into Byzantium, he killed all the soldiers,
   while unarmed, and crowned with the warrior's crown, having broken the
   engagement which he had made with them."

   Thus far you have an account of slaughter: I come now to pestilence,
   which here, according to the Oriental custom, is called death. So the
   Chaldee paraphrast for the Hebrew rvdy, pestilence, is fond of using
   mzh', death; and the Hellenists generally translate it thanaton, and,
   with a similar meaning, it is usually called mortality by
   ecclesiastical writers, which expression has now passed over into many
   of our vernacular tongues. With regard to the pestilence, the fact is
   so notorious and manifest, that there is no need of heaping together
   many proofs to establish the credit of the oracle. I shall dispatch it
   in a word. Tonaras is my author, (nor are others silent on the
   subject,) that under the emperors Gallus and Volusianus, a pestilence,
   arising from Ethiopia pervaded all the Roman provinces, and for fifteen
   successive years incredibly exhausted them. "Nor was there ever a
   greater plague read of by me," (says a celebrated man in our own days,)
   "within the same space of time or territory."

   Famine still remains of that trio of calamities; which indeed, any one
   may collect, could not possibly be absent in this age, although none of
   the ancient writers had informed us of it, from this circumstance, that
   almost all the empire was so despoiled and trodden down by the
   Scythians, during these times, with rapines and devastations, that if
   we trust to Zosimus, no nation under the Roman dominion remained free
   from them; almost all the towns were destitute of walls; and the
   greater part of those which were destitute were taken by them. How was
   it possible that the fields should not be deserted in devastations of
   this kind, that tillage should not be neglected, and that whatever was
   laid up for food should not be destroyed? And that so indeed it really
   happened, appears from the epistle of Dionysius of Alexandria, who was
   then living, to his brothers, in which he bears testimony to that dire
   pestilence of which we are treating, as having succeeded war and
   famine. "After these things," says he, that is, after the persecution
   which took place under Decius, (for lie means that which preceded the
   pestilence,) "both war and famine followed, which we sustained together
   with the heathen." And after the introduction of a few words, he adds:
   "But when both we and they had breathed a little, that pestilence came
   on--a thing more terrific to them than any other species of terror,
   more lamentable than any kind of calamity, and to us indeed an exercise
   and a trial inferior to none of the rest." Cyprian agrees with him in
   his apology to Demetrian: "When you say," he observes, "that a great
   many complain, it is to be imputed to us, that wars more frequently
   arise, that pestilence and famine rage, and that showers and rains
   interrupt the continuance of serene weather; we ought not any longer to
   be silent."

   Moreover, there is something added in the text respecting wild beasts;
   if indeed it be a calamity of a different kind from the former ones,
   and does not imply that the tyrants, who like wild beasts raged in
   those times through the Roman world, were to be assigned as the causes
   of those calamities; it will in this case point out an evil common to
   the eastern and southern regions; that when famine and pestilence are
   raging, wild beasts would grow too powerful for man, and would destroy
   them, as you may see, Lev. c. xxvi. Ezek. c. xiv. v. 15, 21. But the
   change of the syntax rather favours the former opinion, if you render
   kai hupo ton therion tes ges, "and that by the beasts of the earth."

   The fourth part of the earth, to tetarton tes ges, within which the
   power of exercising their ravages is said to have been committed to
   hell and death, (unless any one should think that the common
   interpretation may be here defended to which the tetarton tes ges is
   the tetradion, that is, the quaternion, or four parts of the earth,) I
   explain of the most powerful and much the greater part of the Roman
   world: For since the third part of the earth, (as will be observed in
   its place,) points out the amplitude of the Roman world, it follows
   that the fourth part of the earth is the same Roman dominion, less by a
   fourth part, and therefore that triple or quadruple connexion of
   calamities pervaded three-fourths of the Roman world [12] ; and
   certainly Orosius seems to add, that the pestilence did not extend
   itself farther than (to use his own words) the edicts of Decius ran to
   destroy the churches. I have nothing more to say. And thus far of the
   fourth seal.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [12] The author means, I believe, that if a third of the earth is the
   Roman world, a fourth of the earth would be less than its full extent;
   i. e. supposing the earth to be 12, a third would be 4, and a fourth 3,
   that is, less than 4.

   Of the Fifth Seal.

   The two seals which follow receive no explanation, as to the time of
   their beginning, from the animated beings, and therefore no riders on
   horses are any longer here to be seen, upon which that index of the
   animals depended. The period of each, then, is to be sought from the
   time when the event of the preceding seal ceased; which indeed is very
   easy, when the events, as here, are of such a nature that their
   termination cannot be concealed, in consequence of their manifest
   perspicuity.

   The fifth seal, therefore, will begin with the emperor Aurelian, in the
   year 268, at which time the longest of the calamities of the former
   seal, the pestilence of fifteen years' duration, was extinct.

   Now, the most signal event of the Roman state, under this seal, and
   which surpassed all other events of that time, is that persecution of
   the Christians which begun with Diocletian, was continued by others,
   and was far the most severe of all.

   Former ages saw nothing to compare with it. "It was longer, and more
   cruel," (these are the words of Orosius,) "than all that went before.
   For it was incessantly carried on for ten years, with the burnings of
   churches, the proscription of the innocent, the slaughter of martyrs.
   Immediately on the beginning of the tenth, within thirty days, about
   seventeen thousand men are said to have been sacrificed; nor did the
   fury of the persecutors abate with the progress of time. In Egypt
   alone, (what a small particle of the Roman empire!) if faith is to be
   given to St. Ignatius, patriarch of Antioch, according to Scaliger, "a
   hundred and forty-four thousand men were sacrificed, seven hundred
   (thousand) were driven into exile;" whence the Diocletian era derived
   its name among the Egyptians, so that it is called, even at this day,
   the era of martyrs. What now should you suppose was done throughout the
   other provinces of the Roman empire? "Almost all the world was stained
   with the sacred blood of martyrs," says Sulpitius Severus. "The world
   was never more drained of blood by any wars, nor did the Church" (the
   words are those of the same author) "ever conquer with a greater
   triumph, than when it could not be overcome with the slaughters of ten
   years."

   This butchery is represented by the vision of "souls slain for the word
   of God, and for his testimony which they maintained, lying under the
   altar," that is, on the ground, at the foot of the altar, like victims
   recently slaughtered. For martyrdom is a certain species of sacrifice;
   whence that assertion of the apostle to Timothy, when his own martyrdom
   was near approaching: "I am now about to be offered, and the time of my
   departure is at hand." 2 Tim. c. iv. 6. To which also applies that
   expression of the same apostle to the Philippians: "If I am offered for
   the sacrifice and service of your faith," &c.

   Further, as they are said to have cried with a loud voice to God,
   requiring vengeance for their blood, this is a periphrasis for a
   cruelty so extreme, and ripe for judgment, that it might for its
   barbarity solicit even the long suffering of God to vengeance. "How
   long," say they, "O Lord Holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge
   our blood on those who dwell on the earth?" In the mean time, white
   garments were given to each of them, that is, they were adopted into
   the order of the blessed. The parable is taken from the custom of the
   Jews, in approving and admitting priests. Those whom they had judged
   worthy, from their genealogy and perfect form of body, they received
   into the hall of priests, "clothed in white garments," and so adopted
   them into the sacerdotal order. Maimonides in Mishne, b. viii. c. vi.
   s. 11. Which is plainly expressed in c. vii. vv. 13, 14, 15, where it
   is said of those who are clothed in white garments, "that they are
   before the throne of God, and worship him (as priests) day and night in
   his temple."

   The answer to this cry of blood is, "That they should rest for a short
   time, until (the number of) their fellow servants and of their brethren
   who should be killed, even as they should be complete;" that is, that
   they should endure for a little, until some of their brethren, who,
   after Christianity had begun to prevail, were, under Licinius, Julian,
   and the Arians, to be butchered in like manner, should be added to the
   number; and then, on the sounding of the trumpets, a remarkable
   vengeance should be taken on the empire for the guilt of so much blood.

   Of the Sixth Seal.

   The sixth seal begins where the fifth ends; that is, from the year of
   Christ 311, in which that terrible persecution of ten years ceased.

   The event of this seal is a wonderful commotion of heaven and earth, by
   which that marvellous change of the heathen Roman state, by Constantine
   the Great and his successors, the standard-bearers of the Lamb is
   represented; that is to say, all the gods of the Gentiles, shaken from
   their heaven, their pontiffs and their priests degraded from their
   offices, unhallowed, cast down, and for ever deprived of their
   revenues; the temples, fanes, and images of demons throughout the whole
   Roman world ruined, overthrown, burnt, and demolished. In addition to
   this, emperors, kings, and rulers, who had undertaken to succour their
   gods in such extreme perils, to proclaim war against the ensign-bearers
   of Christ, to combat with immense forces, and even when subdued in
   battle, to renew the war with their utmost strength, were slain with
   unusual slaughter, routed, and dispersed; until at length, in complete
   despair, no one could be found who would bring assistance to the Roman
   religion falling with such a crash. So that within the compass of a few
   words, I think I see comprised whatever the Holy Spirit meant to
   describe by those sublime allegories under this seal. And this is the
   first completion of that victory of Christ, of which the foundation was
   laid in the first seal; to which the seals which have preceded it have
   been subservient, by pointing out in what state of the empire it should
   come to pass, by the presignified distinctions of the time which passed
   away in the interval. It now remains that we should apply the assigned
   interpretation to the several parts of the prophetic allegory, and
   should show the meaning of it.

   "And I looked when he opened the sixth seal, and behold there was a
   great earthquake, and the sun became black as a sackcloth of hair, and
   the moon became as blood, and the stars of heaven fell upon the earth,
   as a fig-tree casteth forth its unripe fruit, when it is shaken by a
   strong wind, and the heaven departed as a book, when it is rolled up;
   and every mountain and island were moved out of their places; and the
   kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief
   captains, and the mighty men, and every slave, and every free man, hid
   themselves in the caves and rocks of the mountains; and they said unto
   the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him
   that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb! for the
   great day of his wrath is come, and who can stand before him?'"

   These are accustomed images of very horrid slaughters, and (if I may so
   speak) of an entire subversion of the state of things, used by the
   prophets, after the manner of the east, as their figures and pictures
   likewise are by our poets. So Jerem. c. iv. v. 23, &c. paints the fall
   of Judea, as if every thing was about to return again into ancient
   chaos. "I beheld the earth," says he, "and behold it was without form
   and void, and the heavens, and there was no light in them. I looked at
   the mountains, and lo they were moved, and all the hills were
   disturbed." In like manner Joel, c. ii. v. 10, says of the horrid
   devastation of the same land by the army of northern locusts: "At his
   face the earth trembled; the heavens also were moved, the sun and moon
   were darkened, and the stars withdrew their splendour." But we must
   treat distinctly of every part. "Behold," says he, "there was a great
   earthquake;" in the Greek seismos, that is, a commotion of heaven and
   earth, as is manifest from what follows; for the Latin word terræmotus
   is not equal to the force of the Greek. Now, an earthquake of that
   kind, according to the testimony of the apostle, Heb. c. xii. upon the
   passage in Haggai, "Yet once more will I shake the heavens and the
   earth," denotes the removing of those things which are shaken; which
   may be confirmed by the same prophet, v. 21 and 22 of the same chapter,
   where he himself interprets this parable exegetically: "I will shake
   the heavens and the earth, and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms,
   and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen," &c. We
   therefore shall consider this commotion of earth and heaven, in this
   place as elsewhere in the Apocalypse, as the ruin of states, and as
   their entire subversion.

   Now, the object of this revolution, as of the former events under the
   seals, is the Roman empire; but not as politically governed by the
   Cæsars, (for in this form it was not yet dissolved,) but as subject to
   Satan and his angels the demons, under the name of religion. This
   demonarchy of the Roman empire, the tempest which lowers in this seal,
   will eventually overthrow, and dissipate with a mighty crash.

   "And the sun and the moon became black as sackcloth of hair, and the
   moon became as blood;" that is, by the ellipsis of an adjective, red as
   blood. This is a periphrasis of the eclipse of the luminaries, in which
   the sun is wont to appear dark, but the moon ruddy. Similar to which is
   that of Isaiah respecting the vengeance on Babylon: "The sun shall be
   obscured in his rising, and the moon shall not cause her light to
   shine." Sept. "shall not give her light." Isa. c. xiii. 10. Matt. c.
   xxiv. 29. Nor has that of the same prophet, c. xxiv. any other sense,
   according to the opinion of Aben Ezra, concerning the slaughter with
   which the Lord, when about to reign in Jerusalem, (exactly as in this
   seal,) should visit the host of heaven on high, and the kings of the
   earth on the earth. "The moon," says he, "shall blush, and. the sun
   shall be ashamed," (that is, each, as if it covered its face for shame,
   shall be clothed with darkness,) "when the Lord of Hosts shall reign in
   Mount Sion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously." But
   what have these things to do, you will say, with the Roman demonarchy?
   Attend, and I will tell you. In the prophets, (as you will find also by
   and by in the following visions,) every kingdom and body of empire
   represents the world; that the parts, likewise, the heavens, and the
   earth, and stars, may correspond with that image. To prove which, (not
   to mention any other passages,) that single place in Isaiah is
   sufficient, c. li. v. 15. "I am the Lord thy God, who divided the sea,
   (namely, the red sea,) and his waves roared; the Lord of Hosts is his
   name. And I put my words in thy mouth," (that is, I gave thee my law,)
   "and I covered thee with the shadow of my hand, that I might plant the
   heavens, and lay the foundation of the earth;" that is, that I might
   make thee a kingdom, or political world, "and I might say unto Sion,
   Thou art my people."

   The subject treated of is the emancipation by which God delivered the
   people of Israel out of Egypt, that he might, of that people, found for
   himself a kingdom or republic in the promised land. From whence it will
   not be difficult to collect what is meant in the same prophet, c. lxv.
   and lxvi. by the new heaven and the new earth, namely, a new world of
   the same kind.

   According to this image, then, heaven, agreeably to the prophetic idea,
   will denote whatever is eminent in the universality of any kingdom or
   republic; the earth, on the contrary, what is lowest; the stars, those
   who obtain and fill a place in that exalted station. By which
   construction, the sun and moon, being the principal lights of heaven,
   the former will indicate the first and chief majesty and dignity of the
   kingdom, the latter the next in order to it; which indeed is so true,
   that the Chaldee paraphrast on the prophets substitutes afterwards, for
   the sun and moon, the kingdom and glory; as Isaiah, c. lx. v. 20.
   Jerem. c. xv. v. 9.

   Let the sun, then, in the Roman kingdom of idols, in right of
   supremacy, be the dragon himself, or Satan, especially since from him
   the Holy Spirit, c. xii. denominates the whole Roman empire in the
   state in which he was treating of it--the seven-headed red dragon, as
   we shall there see.

   The moon, the second luminary of this heaven, you may call the supreme
   pontificate, annexed to the imperatorial majesty, even from its first
   origin, and, as it were, a part of it; or, if you will, the emperor, as
   the pontifex of Satan, with the whole pontifical college, who, with the
   emperor as their head, formed one body, and they presided over the
   religious rites of the gods, and over the whole of the republic, and
   were not liable to render an account to the authority of the senate, or
   of any one as superior to themselves, and therefore in this kingdom
   were not undeservedly to be considered as second to the dragon himself.
   It is not always necessary, I confess, that so accurate an explanation
   of every thing in allegories of this kind should be required; but when
   it can be done, let us apply every minute particular. The sun then of
   which we have been speaking became dark at that time, and suffered an
   eclipse, and obscuration of his baneful majesty, when the Roman
   emperors, having abjured him by baptism, with all his angels, pomps,
   and worship, dedicated themselves to Christ, the sun of righteousness.
   The sun being thus darkened and deprived of light, how could the moon,
   which borrows her light from the sun, be secure? And that very thing,
   or the office of pontifex maxims, Constantine, Constantius,
   Valentinian, Valens, immediately rejected, as it was fit they should,
   unwilling from thenceforward to work for the devil. The name, however,
   at which you may be surprised, they did not on that account despise,
   but retained for a short time inscribed among their titles. Gratian
   first refused the title, as well as the pontifical garments, when
   offered to him, according to custom, by the pontiffs, as unworthy a
   Christian man; (a good act, which deserves to be recorded.) And this
   indeed was a change of such importance, that the Holy Spirit will
   thenceforth consider the Roman Cæsar, thus divested of the pontificate,
   as a new head of the Roman beast and king, as we shall hear in c. xvii.
   But still this moon shone with some light, though melancholy and weak,
   till Theodosius the First, that destroyer of heathenism, took away at
   length the pontifical college itself, with the whole remaining crowd of
   priests, all their revenues being confiscated, by one edict, to the
   treasury. Now then was the time when Satan must seek another pontifex
   maximus for himself. But I proceed to the remaining circumstances.

   "And the stars of heaven fell on the earth, as a fig-tree casts her
   unripe figs when shaken by a great wind, and the heaven departed as a
   book when it is rolled up." Or, "the heaven vanished away," &c. That
   is, the stars of heaven disappeared, as letters vanish from a book
   rolled up in the manner of the ancients. For there is an ellipsis of
   the former substantive, on both sides common to the Hebrew language, as
   Deut. c. xx. v. 19; 2 Kings, c. xviii. v. 31; and elsewhere frequently
   to be found; so that this passage of the disappearance of the heaven,
   and that of the fall of the stars, mutually explain each other, and
   ought not to be separated from one another, as erroneously pointed, but
   ought to be included within the same comma. Indeed, the whole passage
   being from the thirty-fourth chapter of Isaiah, v. 4, where, evidently
   under the same image, though in an inverse order, the Holy Spirit
   paints the slaughter and ruin of the kingdom of Edom,--like this,--a
   kingdom of idols.

   "The heavens," (says he,) "shall be rolled up like a book, and the
   whole host of them, (that is, the stars,) shall fall as a leaf from the
   vine, and as a deciduous fruitling from the fig-tree;" which sentence
   the Apocalyptical Spirit wished to render still clearer by the double
   addition of the words, apechoristhe, "it departed," and hupo megalou
   anemou seiomene, "shaken by a great wind." Moreover, Obadiah, Jeremiah,
   c. xlix. from v. 7 to 22; Ezekiel, c. xxxv. through the whole chapter,
   and c. xxv. v. 12, treat of the same Edomitish ruin, with circumstances
   not more mild than Isaiah, which I notice on this account, lest any one
   should think that the description of Isaiah is suited only to the great
   day of universal judgment.

   But now, to return to the Apocalypse. The stars were the Roman heaven
   of deities, both the gods themselves, the chiefs of that kingdom, under
   Satan their prince, and the nobles, the priests, though of inferior
   rank; for even the stars differ from other stars in order and
   sublimity. These, therefore, are those who, in this wonderful commotion
   of the Roman state, shaken from their seats, "fell on the earth as a
   fig-tree scatters her unripe fruit, when it is shaken by a high wind."

   Nor will this interpretation of the stars as of gods and priests of the
   gods, excite so much surprise in him who remembers that the gods of the
   heathen are every where spoken of in sacred Scripture as the host of
   heaven, and by Daniel, that the priests and elders of the glorious
   land, or of the people of Israel, whom Antiochus Epiphanes had cast to
   the earth, are called by that name. "He magnified himself (says he,)
   against the host of heaven, and cast down to the earth some of the host
   and of the stars, and trampled upon them." What he impiously did
   against the people of the true God, the very same the Christian
   emperors did against the people of the dragon; with this difference,
   however, that in the former case there was only one chief of the host
   of heaven, the Lord Jehovah, who made heaven and earth, against whom,
   though Antiochus might magnify himself, he could not disturb him in
   heaven; but in the latter case, there were many chiefs or demons in the
   Roman heaven, whom all the emperors who bore the standard of Christ,
   did utterly overthrow. Add to this, that the above exposition may be
   confirmed by the Synchronism of the Dragon cast down with his
   attendants from heaven. Chap. xii. "The dragon fought and his angels,
   but they prevailed not, neither was there place found any longer in
   heaven. And the great dragon was cast out; that old Serpent called the
   Devil and Satan."--"And his angels (that is, demons worshipped under
   the name of gods,) were cast out with him." It follows,--"And every
   mountain and island were moved out of their places." Mountains and
   islands might perhaps be taken for persons of higher or lower
   conditions of life, who are enumerated in the very next verse, unless
   the word Island should be thought less favourable to such an
   interpretation. It might, therefore, seem more probable,--if, indeed,
   it has a reference to this subject,--that both point out men of higher
   condition which are eminent in each; the mountains on the earth, the
   islands in the sea. But what if we understand by islands here, not
   lands rising in the midst of waters, but edifices, of whatever kind
   they are called, which, surrounded by a public or private enclosure,
   are not used in common with neighbouring buildings? May we not then
   take both mountains and islands for the temples and shrines of idols,
   overthrown by this whirlwind, throughout the Roman world? For any one
   may see how conformable the notion of mountains is to an interpretation
   of this sort, who is not ignorant that it was customary for idolaters
   to build altars and shrines to their gods in the more lofty places.
   Whence, in every part of the Old Testament, the name of high-places is
   very frequent; nay, in Jeremiah, c. iii. v. 23, the names of hills and
   mountains for the temples of idols. "Surely, (says he,) the hills and
   multitude of the mountains were vain." Now islands for temples are not
   inconsistent with a similar interpretation, since it is very
   appropriate to temples to resemble islands, and they are not polluted
   by communion, or even a contact with the walls of other edifices.
   Supposing, however, it should not be satisfactory, that one and the
   same thing should be represented under two names, consider the
   mountains, if you will, as applicable to sacred places in the country
   and in the fields, and islands as temples of idols in the cities. But
   in such things as these, minutiæ of any sort do not seem to be
   required; so that, perhaps, in every instance, the small points of
   allegorical prophecies are not to be so anxiously suited to the event.
   It is sufficient if the sum and substance of the matter agree on both
   sides.

   The demolition of shrines and temples was effected under the authority
   of the same most pious Theodosius, the standard-bearer of the Lamb. For
   Constantine the Great only shut up the temples of the gods; he did not
   destroy them, except at Constantinople and the adjoining places. Julian
   opened them again. But this emperor ordered them to be utterly
   demolished. The history is well known to every one, nor is there any
   necessity that I should add to what has been already related by the
   ecclesiastic writers on this subject. Perhaps, however, it will not be
   unacceptable to hear Zosimus, a Pagan historian, complaining of, or
   indignant at, this severe fate of his gods. "The sacristies of the
   gods, (says he,) were overthrown through all cities and countries, and
   therefore danger threatened the heads of those who thought them gods,
   or who looked up to heaven at all, and adored what. they saw there." In
   truth, as the Lord, when he was about to conduct ancient Israel out of
   Egyptian bondage, is said to have exercised judgment on all the gods of
   the Egyptians, Exod. c. xii. v. 12, Numb. c. xxxiii. v. 4, so here,
   when he was about to deliver the Christian people from Roman tyranny,
   he exercised judgment on the gods of the Romans. But you will inquire
   when there was such a disturbance, and heaven and earth were blended,
   had those gods no Atlases who applied their shoulders to support the
   falling heavens, and oppose the standard-bearers of Christ thus
   overthrowing all things? Yes, they had; but they experienced a similar
   fate with their demons. "The kings of the earth," says the Scripture,
   "and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the
   mighty men, and every bond and every free man," that is, the emperors,
   Maximinian, Galerius, Maxentius, Maximin, with Martinian Cæsar,
   Licinius, Julian, (add also, if you please, the tyrants Eugenius and
   Arbogastes,) with all their companions in infidelity, of whatever order
   and degree, who endeavoured with force of arms to defend the religion
   of their forefathers, to support the cause of the gods, then falling
   into ruin, and to restore it when already fallen and desperate, were
   reduced at length to such straits, that "they hid themselves in caves
   and rocks of the mountains, and said to the mountains and to the rocks,
   Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him who sitteth on the throne,
   and from the wrath of the Lamb; for the great day of his wrath is come,
   and who will be able to stand?"

   This is a degrading image of persons flying and hiding themselves, and
   of those who are weary of life, from the desperate state of their
   affairs; to which you have a similar description in Luke, c. xxiii. v.
   30. of the slaughter of Jerusalem; also in Hosea, c. x. v. 8. of the
   destruction of Samaria and her idols; but the whole is contained in
   Isaiah, c. xi. v. 18.

   Here, let the reader observe in the first place, that the key to unlock
   the whole vision, is contained in those words; for the matter treated
   of here, is of some splendid victory of the Lamb, by which he subdued
   and overthrew his enemies with a universal slaughter. Moreover, since
   they, whose destruction is described, fly from the Lamb as an enemy,
   and wish to hide themselves from his wrath, it may from hence clearly
   appear, that the slaughter, although it be pointed out by no
   synchronism, can by no means be applied to Christian kings, but to
   those who were estranged from Christ; and, therefore, ought not to be
   explained of slaughters by the Goths, and other barbarous nations upon
   the empire, after it had become Christian. But lastly, what the kings,
   nobles, and chief captains, and the rest of the Gentiles in the same
   situation with themselves, say in addition, that the great day of the
   wrath of the Lamb is come, and no one would be able to stand, are the
   words of men acknowledging the power of Christ, whom up to that time
   they had despised, in comparison with their gods; and believing in
   truth, that every attempt to resist the Christians would be fruitless.
   And this, in fact, they all thought; but Galerius, Maximin, and
   Licinius, even by open confession, however unwillingly, attribute the
   glory to God.

   For Eusebius, with others, is our authority, that Galerius (with whom
   Christ begun in this judgment), being seized with a most filthy and
   horrible disease, in which his body, in consequence of worms spreading
   over it, putrified with an intolerable stench, was struck at last with
   a consciousness of the crimes which he had committed against the
   Church, and having confessed his guilt to God, abstained from
   persecution of the Christians, and by laws, and imperial edicts,
   hastened the building of their churches, and commanded the accustomed
   prayers to be offered up for him; and a short time after poured forth a
   soul guilty of such cruelty towards the Christians as had never been
   equalled. [13]

   Maximin, a most inhuman enemy of the Christians, relying on magic, on
   the divinations of idols, and the oracles of demons, in all which he
   trusted; nevertheless, being conquered by Licinius more than once,
   while he was yet defending the Christian faith with Constantine, his
   colleague, having cast away the ensigns of empire, fled and lurked for
   some time in the fields and villages in the habit of a slave; and at
   length, being shut up in Tarsus of Cilicia, and inflamed with fury, he
   butchered many priests and prophets of the gods, by whose oracles he
   had been excited to undertake the war, as fortune-tellers, impostors,
   and at length, betrayers of his safety; and then, giving glory to the
   God of the Christians, he is said to have promulgated a decree for
   their deliverance; but suddenly stricken by God, requiring punishment
   for so many crimes against the Christians, with a dreadful and mortal
   disease, and his whole flesh being by degrees eaten away, and consumed,
   and at length (as a just retribution for the punishment which he had
   meditated against the Christians), his eyes having started out, in
   consequence of the heat with which he was totally burnt up, he made his
   confession to the Lord, and breathed out his soul, acknowledging that
   he deserved to suffer those things on account of his madness and
   temerity against Christ [14] .

   Lastly, Licinius, the deserter of the Christians, whose party he had
   for some time espoused, with Constantine, and boasting proudly to his
   soldiers of the multitude of his gods in opposition to that one only
   God of Constantine, and him a novel and a foreign God (for so he called
   him), having been conquered in two great battles (in one of which, out
   of an army of 130,000 men, scarce 30,000 escaped), and being still
   unwilling to remain at rest, was at length condemned by Constantine,
   with his followers, by the laws of war, and given up to deserved
   punishment. But when they who were the authors of the war undertaken
   against God, were brought together with the tyrant to the place of
   punishment, as on the former occasion, they had insolently exulted in a
   hope placed in vain gods, so now they were brought to confess that they
   understood, in truth, how great and wonderful the God of Constantine
   was, and to acknowledge Him as the true and only God [15] .

  APPENDIX.

   From the ancient monuments of the Egyptians, Persians, and Indians,
   from the authors Tarphanes, interpreter of Pharaoh; Baramus of
   Saganessa, king of the Persians (a contemporary of Diocletian);
   Syrbachamus, interpreter of the king of the Indians; Apomasar, or,
   according to others, Achmet, F. Scirim, an Arab, collected
   Oneirokritika, or interpretations of dreams, as that people were very
   much devoted, from the earliest antiquity, to pursuits of this nature,
   as well as of other kinds, so were they, while their empire flourished,
   eager to translate the writings of all nations into Arabic. This little
   book, which was formerly in Greek, by what author is uncertain, John
   Leunclavius published in the last century, translated into Latin by
   himself, out of the library of Joseph Sambucus. The same afterwards, in
   the year 1603, Nicolas Rigaltius communicated from the library of the
   most Christian king, in his Oneirocritics, having supplied what was
   wanting in the copy of Sambucus. In this book you may see that many
   prophetic images, which create so much difficulty to our countrymen,
   were familiar to the Oriental nations, and were certainly not unusual
   in their divinations. Of the authors from whom the collection is made,
   the most ancient of all appear to be Tarphan, the Egyptian, as one who
   not only calls himself the interpreter of Pharaoh, but every where in
   his interpretations, uses the name of Pharaoh for a king.

   It would therefore appear, that he lived at a time when Egypt had still
   kings of its own, and while the same were called Pharaoh. The Persian,
   with his king Saganissa, was, as I have said, of the same age as
   Diocletian. The Indian is of a later age, as lie every where proclaims
   himself a Christian.

   But there is a wonderful agreement of both with the Egyptian.

   Since, then, we are not unwilling to learn the meaning of words and
   phrases in the sacred writings from those nations which were formerly
   the nearest to the Hebrew people, and most connected with them in
   manners, and the use of language, why should we undervalue the same
   advantages here, in the signification of figures and prophetic images?
   (for, according to the Hebrew masters, the determination of prophecy is
   that of dreams.)

   Let no one, then, impute it to me as a fault, if I annex out of this
   author those passages which appear to me to make the figures of the
   seal just explained, more intelligible.

   The same, likewise, I shall do hereafter, with the reader's good leave,
   as occasion may offer, on the trumpets, and the other visions.

   Circumstances, which throw light on the First Seal, and partly also on
   those which follow.

   Chap. ccxxxiii. Of the opinions of the Indians, Persians, and
   Egyptians.

   A noble spirited horse, which is called Pharas, refers to eminence and
   dignity, in the interpretation of dreams. Common horses are understood
   of nobility, and of some inferior rank.

   If any one in his dreams has seemed to be carried on a fleet and wanton
   horse, he shall find in the presence of the people, fame, and the
   greatest estimation, as well as eminence and honour.

   Also, if any one seemed to be riding armed on a noble horse, he will
   find power, together with good reputation, on account of his arms.

   Chap. ccxlix. According to the Interpretations of the Persians and
   Egyptians.

   If any one seemed to have held bows and arrows in his hand, he shall
   exult with joy over his enemies.

   There are more passages relating to the same subject, as chap. clii.
   from the doctrine of the Indians, concerning the large and long tail of
   a horse, signifying companions and followers of his power; of the short
   cut tail, signifying the loss of liberty, as well as sovereignty, if it
   were a prince who dreamt of riding on such a horse. In the same manner,
   chap. ccxxxiii. the dismounting from a horse, if voluntary, is
   explained of a spontaneous decrease of power; if unwillingly, of a
   successor in dignity, assuming his place.

   The following things throw light on the Third Seal.

   Chap. xv. Of the Doctrine of the Indians.

   If any one in his dreams has seen a balance, or a bell, as they call
   it, a species of balance, justly weighing in a certain place, let him
   understand it, of the person of a judge. But if he has a quarrel, and
   the things appeared to be equally balanced, he shall obtain his cause.

   If he should seem to observe an equal and a pure balance, let him know,
   that the judge of that place is just. But if he should see the scales
   broken, and turned upside down, he may conclude, that the judge of the
   place where he saw the dream, is unjust.

   Besides, weights also have the same interpretation as measures,
   according to their quantities, but they are applied to the persons of
   inferior judges.
     __________________________________________________________________

   These relate to the Sixth Seal.

   Chap. clxvii. From the Writings of the Indians, Persians, and
   Egyptians.

   The sun relates, in interpretation, to the person of the king, and the
   moon to the person of the prince, who is second to the king: Venus to
   the person of the empress, or Augusta, and also the other largest stars
   to the greatest persons about the king. While I am collecting these
   things, I am almost induced to think, that the famous title of Sapor,
   king of the Persians, in his letters delivered to the emperor
   Constantius, (Sapor, king of kings, partner of the stars, brother of
   the sun and moon, to Constantius Cesar, my brother, greeting,) which
   Ammianus Marcellinus attributes to Persian pride, was no other than the
   vernacular style of the nation, arising from images of this kind; which
   ought to appear less wonderful to any one, since we see even our own
   heralds, in publishing the arms of emperors and kings, apply to them
   the names of the sun and moon, and of the other planets. Hither,
   likewise, may be referred Jacob's interpretation of the dream of
   Joseph, his son, of the sun and moon, and eleven stars, making
   obeisance to him, which he immediately, as by no means ignorant of the
   parables of the east, applies to his own family, interpreting the sun
   and moon of himself and his wife, as king and queen; the stars, of his
   sons, as the nobles of the family, Gen. c. xxxvii. v. 10. But let us
   return to our Achmet, for be proceeds in the same chapter.

   If any one has thought that he saw the sun in the heaven deprived of
   light and rays, calamity and disgrace appertain to the person of the
   king.

   If the sun has appeared to be in eclipse, that portends affliction and
   war to the king.

   If any one has thought he saw the sun covered with a cloud, the king
   will fall into distress and diseases, by way of occultation.

   If any one has seen the sun, and moon, and stars, collected together
   without light; if he is of the number of grandees, he absolutely
   approaches to ruin, on account of that darkness; if he is king
   surrounded by all, he shall be sought out in battle, and shall fall
   into great affliction.

   Chap. clxviii. Of the Observations of the Persians and Egyptians.

   If any one has imagined he saw the stars possessed of very little
   light, cast down, scattered and obscured, this vision is to be referred
   to the calamity of the nobles, opulent men, and to the presidents of
   the king.

   The sixth seal being finished, we should proceed forthwith in order to
   the seventh, (big as it is with its sevenfold plague,) as what coheres
   with the sixth in an immediate connexion. But the Holy Spirit, by a
   sure suggestion, has led to the delay of our progress for a little
   while, until it has placed before our eyes the state of an assembly
   contemporizing with it, which was to be safe under its plagues, and was
   also to survive them.

   Let us then hold the torch of interpretation, in the first place, to
   that vision, as far as we are able, and then we will continue the order
   of the seals which we have begun.

THE VISION

   Of the Company of the Servants of God, or of the elect and faithful
   Church to be preserved under the ruins of the Seventh Seal, or of the
   Trumpets, exhibited under the type of the one hundred and forty-four
   thousand sealed out of all the tribes of Israel, at the beginning of
   the Seventh Seal.

   The vision of those who are sealed is introduced twice: First, in this
   place, in the beginning of the trumpets, in the first prophecy; again,
   as the contrast to the beast, when possessed of power, in the second
   prophecy, c. xiv.; and that with a double view;--here, for the purpose
   of preserving them under the ruins resulting from the trumpets; there,
   for the purpose of extolling them on account of their faith maintained
   to God and the Lamb, when the other inhabitants of the world, deserters
   and revolters, had received the mark of the beast. From which it
   clearly appears, that the prophecy of the beast contemporizes with the
   events of the trumpets; but to what extent, is to be decided by some
   other means, namely, not beyond the end of the sixth trumpet, in which
   the months of the beast conclude with the days of the mourning
   witnesses. c. xi. v. 14. It is our present design to hold the torch of
   interpretation to the first vision of the sealed ones, which regards
   their preservation. Hereafter, when we arrive so far, we shall treat of
   their commendation.

   "After these things," says he, (that is, when the vision of the sixth
   seal is ended, and the seventh, which is that of the trumpets, is about
   to begin,) "I saw four angels standing upon the four corners of the
   earth, restraining the four winds of the earth, that they might not
   blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree."

   The sense is, He saw angels who presided over the winds, that is, over
   the storms of war and calamities, which, from whatever part of the
   world they were about to issue forth, were to be restrained as long as
   it pleased God; but at his nod, whenever he gave the signal, were to be
   let loose on the whole world. Not indeed the same with the angels of
   the trumpets, but those who were at their sounding, to let loose those
   winds, now from one and now from another part of the world, to ravage
   and destroy the Roman state. For the parable of the winds in the
   prophets implies warlike movements, and hostile attacks and invasions;
   as Jer. c. xlix. v. 36. "I will bring upon Elam the four winds from the
   four quarters of heaven, and I will scatter them towards all those
   winds; and there shall not be a nation to which the outcasts of Elam
   shall not come." Also, c. li. v. 1, 2. "Behold I, saith the Lord, will
   raise up upon Babel, &c. a destroying wind; and I will send out upon
   Babel winnowers, and they shall winnow her, and shall make empty her
   land." And likewise, c. xviii. v. 17. "As an eastern wind will I
   scatter them, (that is, the Jews,) before the enemy," namely, the king
   of Babylon. Hither likewise, it seems, may that passage of Daniel be
   referred, c. vii. 2, 3. "Behold the four winds of heaven strove on the
   great sea, and four great beasts ascended out of the sea;" that is,
   from the conflict of nations on every side, rushing among each other
   with war and the sword, and contending for dominion and empire, four
   great kingdoms arose.

   "And I saw," says he, "another angel ascending from the rising sun,
   having the seal of the living God, (perhaps therefore Christ the Lord,)
   and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given
   to hurt the earth and the sea, (namely, by letting loose the winds
   which they had restrained,) saying, Hurt not the earth, nor the sea,
   nor the trees, till I have sealed the servants of our God in their
   foreheads;'" that is, do not let loose the winds, nor give them the
   power of going forth, and raging over the world. He names the earth,
   sea, and trees, agreeably to the image of winds, as those objects to
   which the winds are wont to do damage; to the earth, by the ruin of
   buildings; to the sea, by shipwrecks; to trees, by manifold injury and
   laceration.

   "Hold!" says he, "till we have sealed the servants of our God in their
   foreheads;" that is, until we have distinguished them by a mark
   impressed, as the elect assembly of God, on which those destroying
   winds, which were to consign to ruin the remaining society of men,
   should have no power; but over which, marked with his seal, Divine
   Providence would continually watch, lest in this ruin of the Roman
   state, which the trumpets would effect, this holy progeny should be
   extinguished. For the event was to be ordered, that they should not go
   without punishment who injured them, as having transgressed the limits
   of the right granted them by God; and farther, that the injury, if any
   should befall them, should be immediately recompensed by God. There is
   an allusion to the passage in Ezekiel, c. ix. where those who are
   sighing and exclaiming for the abominations of Jerusalem, are sealed by
   an angel for this purpose, that they might not sustain equal
   destruction with the impious and reprobate, from those who were to
   smite them. And, in truth, the event which relates to this declaration,
   (if any one will consider the state of the times of which we are
   speaking) will appear like a miracle;--that it could have been
   possible, when the Roman empire was desolated and destroyed, by so
   great a havock of cities and their inhabitants, so that its ancient
   population being nearly extinct, it was inhabited by a barbarous
   people, and by nations who were aliens to Christ; yet that the Church,
   in the very same place, in the midst of these evils, and while, as it
   were, the world was falling into ruin over its head, should still
   endure; nay, even that the beast in the same time, (as we shall hear in
   its place,) while idolatrous worship was defiling the whole of
   Christianity, should nevertheless nourish in its bosom an undefiled
   assembly such as this, and that in the name of a reverence for God. Of
   such importance was it to have been protected by the seal of God.

   "And I heard," says he, "the number of those which were sealed--a
   hundred and forty-and-four thousand were sealed of all the tribes of
   Israel;" that is, twelve times twelve thousand, being twelve thousand
   of each of the tribes.

   For as in the beginning, we saw the theatre of the visions, or the
   Apocalyptical Assembly, described according to the image and state of
   the ancient synagogue, and great part of this book of types has a
   reference to the same; so that, as false Christians in the epistles to
   the churches may on that account be spoken of as false Jews, so
   likewise here, the universal church of the Gentiles, secured by the
   seal of God, is figured under the type of Israel, the twelve apostles
   of the former aptly corresponding with the same number of the
   patriarchs in the latter.

   Nor is it thus done undeservedly; as for other causes, so chiefly
   because the church, which, from the time of the rejection of the Jews,
   was collected out of the nations, succeeded in the place of Israel, and
   became (if I may so speak) the substitute of Israel, and was to be
   accounted in that state by God, until his ancient people, having at
   length obtained mercy, "the fulness of the Gentiles should have come
   in;" that is, the "innumerable multitude out of all nations, tribes,
   peoples, and tongues," which at last, when the signature of this Israel
   was finished, John testifies that he saw singing praises to God and to
   the Lamb. This indeed is that doctrine (I speak of substitution), which
   the Apostle Paul means to teach in Romans, c. xi. when he inculcates
   that the fall of the Jews should bring salvation to the Gentiles, and
   their rejection should be the reconciliation of the world. Not that by
   other means the Gentiles were not called in their own time, since the
   whole chorus of the prophets exclaims that the Gentiles should be
   gathered together to the glory of Israel, and should be converted to
   the Lord, (which the Jews themselves, either in ancient times or at the
   present day, did or do distrust,) but that, not by this calling, which
   was made by anticipation or surrogation, and as an incitement to
   emulation, if the Jews had not renounced Christ. An intelligent person
   will understand what I mean. "It was necessary," says the apostle, Acts
   c. xiii. "that the Word of God should first have been spoken to you;
   but since ye put it from you, and consider yourselves unworthy of
   eternal life, lo! we turn to the Gentiles."

   That testimony of Amos, quoted by James in the Council of the Apostles,
   Acts, c. xv. (not to notice this likewise), seems to have been intended
   of the anticipated conversion of the Gentiles, i. e. of that which
   would precede the restoration of the Jews; and on that account, was
   then, perhaps, preferred to the other prophecies, which might have been
   otherwise understood of the adoption of the Gentiles among the people
   of God. For he intimates, not only that the name of the Lord should be
   called on the nations, (i. e. that the Gentiles should become his
   people,) but also, that this should take place partly at a time when
   the tabernacle of David should yet lie in ruins; that is, that the
   kingdom of Israel should not yet be restored by Christ. "After this,"
   says he, "I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David,
   which is fallen down, and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I
   will set it up, that the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and
   all the nations upon whom my name is called;" that is, that the rest of
   mankind, together with those nations upon whom, even before that
   period, my name would be called, should at length seek after and
   worship the true God. For instead of what is now read in the Hebrew
   text, "that they should inherit the remainder of Idumea," it seems to
   have been formerly written, that "the residue of men should seek after
   the Lord." Nay, from the Hebrew reading which now obtains, the same
   inference may he collected of the anticipated adoption of the Gentiles
   into the people of God, namely, in this sense,--that the Jews being
   brought back, when the tabernacle of David, which had fallen down,
   should at last be restored, the remains of Edom as well as the
   Gentiles, upon whom the name of God was long previously called, should
   be admitted by hereditary right. Therefore, some of the Gentiles would
   become the people of God before the restoration of the tabernacle of
   David. But of this enough.

   With respect to the number of the sealed, the number twelve is a mark
   of the apostolical family, which denotes the apostolical progeny, by
   multiplying thousands of each tribe as well as all together; a progeny,
   we may suppose, though increased to many thousands, yet by no means
   degenerate, but representing their parents in faith and sanctity. For,
   doubtless, as "to have the number of the beast" (of which we shall
   hereafter hear), signifies being of the people or followers of the
   beast,--so, to bear the number of the apostles, signifies being the
   legitimate offspring of the apostles. The analogy of the New Jerusalem
   shows this to be the truest interpretation of the multiplication by
   twelve, in the structure of which, and in the dimensions of its gates,
   of the area of its foundation, of the circuit, length, breadth, and
   height of its walls, the same number twelve, or the multiplication by
   twelve is adopted. And that we might have no farther hesitation to what
   that twelve-fold multiplication refers, lo! it is expressly said, of
   the twelve foundations of the wall, that they were inscribed with the
   names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. c. xxi. v. 14. "Of the tribe
   of Judah, of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, Aser, Naphtali, Manasses,
   Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zabulon, Joseph, and Benjamin, of each of these
   tribes were sealed twelve thousand." The tribes are in no other part of
   Scripture enumerated in this order, although in other places they are
   reckoned in various modes. For besides that Dan does not appear with
   them at all, nor is the name of Ephraim spoken of in the rest, there is
   a departure here from the rule of all the enumerations which are made
   elsewhere, and neither the order of nativity, nor dignity of family is
   preserved; but the last are blended with the intermediate, and the
   younger sons of servants are preferred more than once to the elder
   children of wives, so that it can by no means be doubted but that some
   remarkable mystery of a typical kind lies concealed under such a novel
   and unusual order. This, with God's favour on our undertaking, we think
   that we have discovered, and it is in this manner:--

   First, Dan is rejected from this type, and Ephraim is passed over, in
   silence, as the standard bearers and leaders of the Israelitish
   apostasy (Jud. c. xvii. and xviii.), and the same as were the patrons
   of the public idols in Dan and Bethel, in the time of the kingdom. They
   were therefore, altogether unfit to represent the followers of a purer
   religion.

   But that, nevertheless, the number of twelve might be complete, Levi is
   substituted in the room of Dan, and the name of Joseph with the
   omission of that of Ephraim. The number being thus constituted, the
   sons of wives and servants, independent of the accustomed dignity of
   the family, are intermingled, and the children of servants are adopted
   as those of their mistresses. "For in Christ there is neither bond nor
   free," but all are of equal estimation. Since, then, the sons of Leah,
   both natural and adoptive, are double the number of Rachel, for there
   are eight of the former, and only four of the latter, therefore such an
   order is observed in reckoning them, that the four sons of Leah might
   be compared in a double mode, alternately with the two of Rachel: But
   on both sides, those tribes are preferred as more excellent than the
   rest, which some transaction, either of their own, or of their
   offspring, related in the Holy Scriptures, respecting the true worship
   of God, and zeal towards Him, had rendered worthy of commendation.

   The family of Leah are at the head of the first troop in virtue of the
   prerogative of Christ, the Prince of the company, as sprung from that
   stock. In the following manner:

   First Quaternion of the Sons of Leah. { 1. Judah Second Quaternion of
   the Sons of Leah. { 7. Simeon
   2. Reuben 8. Levi
   3. Gad 9. Issachar
   4. Aser 10. Zabulon
   First Couple of the Sons of Rachel. { 5. Naphtali Second Couple of the
   Sons of Rachel. { 11. Joseph
   6. Manasseh 12. Benjamin
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Reason of the Order of the Sons of Leah.

   Judah, Reuben, Gad, Aser, constitute, as you see, the first quaternion
   of the sons of Leah, as superior to the rest in respect to Him of whom
   the type points out the nobility.

   Among those, the first place, as justly due, is bestowed on Judah, on
   account of Christ, the King of the faithful, descended from that tribe.
   The second on Reuben, whom that illustrious protestation concerning
   building the altar of remembrance on the banks of Jordan, ennobled, and
   which he deserved, that he might not yield the prerogative of his
   nativity (for he was the first-born) to any other than to the royal
   tribe of Judah. The third place is allotted to Gad, as the associate of
   Reuben in that celebrated protestation of retaining the true worship of
   God, and illustrious besides for Elias the prophet, and him the king,
   the destroyer of Baalism.

   Aser, in fine, assumes the fourth and last place in this quaternion,
   illustrious for the widow of Sarepta, who reverenced Elijah, (Sarepta
   lying in the lot of Aser,) and noted also for Anna the prophetess, of
   the tribe of Aser, who bore testimony to Christ, when she was remaining
   in the temple according to the law, but by no means to be compared with
   the three preceding, because each was a female.

   Simeon, Levi, Issachar, and Zabulon are deferred to the last
   quaternion, either because they were embellished with no names, or with
   fewer than the former; or if they had any, by such as were obliterated
   afterwards by some kind of wickedness. For Levi blotted out the
   remembrance of the zeal by which he approved himself in the wilderness,
   (to pass over the sedition of Korah,) by his fellowship with
   Israelitish apostates and idolaters, even from the beginning. For
   Jonathan the Levite, the grandson of Moses, gave up his services in
   introducing the worship of images to Micah the Ephraimite and the
   Danish robbers. Judg. c. xvii. v. 10, and c. xviii. v. 30. It is
   possible also, that the substitution of Levi in the place of Dan might
   have degraded him into the fourth quaternion. Moreover, since the
   brethren of this quaternion have no quality in which some excel others,
   they preserve the order of their nativity unaltered, and every one is
   enumerated in that order in which he was born.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Reason of the Order of the Sons of Rachel.

   Observe that among the posterity of Rachel, two of them paired
   together, Naphtali and Manasseh, head the family: Joseph and Benjamin
   bring up the rear. Naphtali and Manasseh are preferred, because he was
   illustrious, as well in Barak, the conqueror of Sisera the Canaanite,
   as in Hiram, a Naphtalite on his father's side, the artificer of the
   instruments and furniture of the temple of God; (1 Kings, c. vii. v.
   14. 2 Chron. c. ii. v. 14.) and in a name yet greater, of whom
   hereafter; the latter was noted for Gideon, the subverter of Baal, and
   Elisha the prophet.

   But the glory of Christ's inhabitation exalts Naphtali, though the son
   of a maid-servant, above Manasseh, as when Christ was about to enter on
   his office, he fixed his residence and seat of his preaching in the
   noblest city of the tribe of Naphtali, and the metropolis of all
   Galilee, Capernaum, whence, as from an episcopal city, he went forth
   many times over all Galilee with his apostles, into all the synagogues
   and villages, teaching the gospel of the kingdom, and shining forth
   with miracles of healing. For, Reader, I wish to remark, from the
   Evangelical History, (because it escapes many,) that our Saviour dwelt
   in Galilee during the whole time that he abode on earth; but that he
   was seen in Judea, the principal seat both of the nation and of his own
   tribe, only at the time of the festivals. And this is what Isaiah of
   old had predicted, Isa. c. ix. Matt. c. iv. v. 14.; that "the wonderful
   Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, (Sept. the Father
   of the age to come,) the Prince of Peace,"--in one word, the Messiah,
   should be a Galilean; and, as if in compensation and consolation of the
   captivity, which Galilee, first of all the regions in the Holy Land,
   had then recently undergone from the Assyrian, (2 Kings, c. xv. v. 29.)
   that the tract in question should be peculiarly enlightened by his
   presence; apparently, indeed, that public way, called "the Way of the
   Sea," which, coming out of Syria to Jordan, passes through the middle
   of Capernaum, and from thence, proceeding near the Sea of Galilee,
   leads into Egypt. Let us hear what he says, (vide Hebrew.) "As in
   former times he rendered vile the land of Zabulon and the land of
   Naphtali, (viz. as 1 have observed by Tiglathpileser,) so at the last
   he will render it glorious." For "the way of the sea (trodden by the
   Assyrian) to the passage of Jordan, (where Capernaum was situated,)
   Galilee of the Gentiles,--the people which walked in darkness, (namely,
   of afflictions,) have seen a great light; to those who dwelt in the
   region of the shadow of death, on them has the light shined," &c. Would
   you know whence and under whose influence Galilee will be so blessed,
   and within that maritime way where the passage of the Jordan was? he
   immediately subjoins, "For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is
   given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name
   shall be called Wonderful, the Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Father
   of Eternity, the Prince of Peace."

   But those words (with which our transcribers, almost treading in the
   footsteps of the Jews, who never understood this prophecy, begin the
   chapter with a great disturbance of the sense,) I annex with Jerome and
   the Royal Bibles to the last sentence of the preceding chapter; and I
   render them, "For there is no obscurity in Him who is the cause of
   their trouble," that is, in the calamitous and afflicted state of
   things into which the Israelitish republic at that time is reported to
   have fallen, according to the threatening of the law, and which is as
   it were submitted to our sight; men were driven to indignation and
   despair because they saw the enemy by which they were oppressed enjoy
   perpetual success, and that no misfortune befel him. It is of great
   importance to the Christian faith, that this oracle concerning the
   Galilean Messiah should he clearly understood, and the fidelity of
   Matthew, who alleges it, should be asserted; on which account I. was
   desirous of throwing some light upon it on this occasion, hoping that
   the Reader would not consider it as unacceptable. I return to the
   Apocalypse, and I will add one thing more before I dismiss Naphtali;
   that, as among the sons of Leah, the first place was allotted to Judah,
   on account of the generation of Christ, so among those of Rachel
   Naphtali was noticed on account of his dwelling, that the prerogative
   of Christ might be supereminent on both sides, in whose name, as that
   of Lord and Emperor, the assembly (as we shall hear in its proper
   place) is enrolled.

   Joseph and Benjamin remain, transferred to be the last pair of Rachel's
   children, and of whom the sirname of Ephraim degraded to this place,
   since it is Ephraim, in truth, who is concealed under the name of
   Joseph, having been unworthy, on his own account, (because he was the
   leader of the Israelitish idolatry introduced by Micah, and also
   because of that enormous apostasy of which Jeroboam and Ahab were the
   founders,) to have his name repeated in the catalogue. Benjamin
   likewise, beside being the youngest born, the hatred of Saul the
   Benjamite, against David, and the curses of Shimei against him who was
   the head of the family and the type of Christ, deprived of a higher
   station.
     __________________________________________________________________

  A MEMORABLE SENTENCE,

   Formed from the signification of the names by which the tribes were
   called, by which both the order of the tribes sealed, the disposition
   of the assembly itself, its contest and reward by God are declared.

   Judah. . . . confitetur Deo } The blessed Assembly confesses to God by
   looking to the Son. { Cultus purus et rite Christianus.
   Pure and truly Christian worship
   Reuben. . . . .intuendo Filium

   their obedience. { Lucta.

   Reward.
   Isachar. . . . mercedem
   Zabulon. . . . habituculi (scil. æterni)
   Joseph. . . . adjicit
   Benjamin. . . . Filio dextrræ

   The blessed assembly, the assembly of those who are sealed, confess or
   celebrate God, by looking to his Son, that is, to Christ the only
   Mediator. They contend with those who are forgetful of their obedience,
   that is, with the antichristians. Adhesion to Christ will add to the
   Son of His right hand, (that is, to him whom God highly values) the
   reward of a habitation or eternal mansion. Or otherwise, the Son of His
   right hand (that is, Christ) will add to those who adhere to God, the
   reward of a habitation, or mansion of eternal life.

   To this more contracted and afflicted state of the Church, under the
   type of those who are sealed out of the people of Israel, succeeds that
   most ample, and by far most prosperous state of the same, under the
   image of an innumerable multitude of palm-bearers, out of every nation,
   and people, and tribe, and language. "After these I beheld, and lo! a
   great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation, and of
   all tribes, and people, and tongues, standing before the Throne, and
   before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and with palms in their hands;
   and they cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God that
   sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb."

   But since this vision pertains to the seventh trumpet, and cannot be
   conveniently and clearly explained elsewhere, on account of so many
   things which require to be previously known, we will therefore postpone
   the exposition of it. At present it may be sufficient that the reader
   should remember what has been just now generally said, that both the
   visions in conjunction pervade the whole interval of the seventh seal,
   or of the trumpets; but separately, that the assembly of the sealed
   synchronizes with the first six trumpets, and the multitude of the
   palm-bearers with the seventh.

   And thus having completed the interpretation of the interposed vision,
   or visions, let us resume the discontinued series of the seals.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Meaning of the Seventh Seal, that is, of the Seven Trumpets.

   They were the six first seals, in which the state of the empire, yet
   standing and flourishing, was described, until the power of idolatry
   fell by intestine misfortunes. The seventh succeeds, the subject matter
   of which is seven trumpets, under which the fates of the declining and
   falling empire, proceeding to ruin by a sevenfold order of plagues,
   while the trumpets are sounding the alarm, are displayed under images
   suited to such an event. God, in truth, executing punishment by that
   destruction for the blood of so many martyrs, shed under Roman
   auspices. For He, whose will it is that even brute animals should not
   be spared, if they have slain man, made in His image, would He not
   require the blood of His servants of the empire which had been a
   martyricide for so many revolving years?

   Neither could the late piety of the Christian emperors, then possessed
   of the power of the state, avail to intercede with the justice of God,
   any more than the piety of Josiah, for the kingdom of Judah, guilty of
   the blood spilt by Manasseh, that it might escape the ruin decreed by
   God. This revenge, the souls of the martyrs, groaning under that
   dreadful butchery of the fifth seal, invoked earnestly with their
   prayers: This God promised, as soon as the Roman tyrant, by the
   addition of those who still remained to be slaughtered, had filled up
   the measure of iniquity, c. vi. v. 11]. This time had now arrived.

   Wherefore an angel, the priest of heaven, at the altar of incense,
   offers up those prayers (as was the custom with the prayers of the
   people made in the temple), by fumigation to the throne of God; and
   recalls them to His memory.

   In the mean time, "there was silence in heaven for the space of half an
   hour," according to the rites of the temple in performing a sacrifice
   of this nature. For it is evident, that in sacrifices, in every part of
   the world, silence was a part of religion. They said, "Attend in
   silence." That was observed by the people of God, when they offered
   incense. For, while the sacrifices were offering (which was the first
   part of their liturgy), the temple resounded with hymns, trumpets, and
   other musical instruments, 2 Chron. c. xxix. v. 25-28. But at the time
   of incense every thing was silent, and the people prayed in silence to
   themselves, Luke, c. i. v. 10. To this, then, there is an allusion,
   when it is said, that while the angel was about to offer sacrifices at
   the golden altar, "there was silence in heaven for the space of half an
   hour;" that is, during the whole time of incense. Which being at length
   finished, "an angel filled a censer with fire from the altar, and cast
   it on the earth." And he acted thus to signify by this rite, to what
   subject those prayers referred, which rising to God, had been imbued
   with grateful odour; namely, to implore vengeance on the inhabitance of
   the earth, who had injured the saints, and had even shed their blood.

   But the prayers immediately obtained an answer; for "there were," says
   he, (that is, from the Throne, or inmost recess of the temple,)
   "voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake." In which
   words is described the oracle vt qvl--Bath Kol, that is, the daughter
   of the voice, or of thunder, by which God formerly gave responses to
   his ancient people, and by the same assented here to the prayers of the
   saints. Now in the Hebrew language it is to be understood, that voices
   and thunderings have the same signification. For thunderings are called
   qvlvt, that is, voices. Kai, then, is either to be taken explanatorily,
   for that is; or as I should prefer by the figure en dia duoin, voices
   and thunderings are voices of thunder, or attended with thunder. God,
   indeed, for the most part, uttered His decrees with thunder, as he also
   delivered the law, Ex. c. xix. v. 16. Nay, it was the only oracle which
   remained to the Jews after the Babylonian captivity; of which there is
   an example in our evangelist, c. xii. 28. When the Lord had said,
   "Father, glorify thy name, there came," says he, "a voice from heaven,
   I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.'" It follows. "And
   the people which stood by and heard it, said it thundered. Others said,
   An angel spake to him;" that is, some said it was Divine thunder, or
   thunder joined with the Divine voice, namely, the daughter of thunder;
   but others, that an angel spoke. And hence it is that, in the
   Apocalypse, not only in this place, but elsewhere generally, thunder is
   connected with Oracles and Divine voices, as c. iv. v. 5, c. vi. v. 1,
   c. x. v. 3. Vide the sacred Aristarchus of the most illustrious Daniel
   Heinsius, p. 277 and 455.

   The sacrifice being thus ended, and God having assented to the prayers
   of his saints with the voice of thunder, "the seven angels who had the
   seven trumpets, prepared themselves to sound." That the works of Divine
   providence and government are carried on by the administration of
   angels, is confessed by all theologians. The angels, therefore,
   preserve their place in those visions, in the transactions to which
   they are pre-appointed by God, and what is performed by the common
   agency of angels and men, is said to be performed by the authority of
   angels, as principals and leaders. So that they appear to me to wander
   wholly from the mark, who, under the name of angels, imagine that some
   mystery lies concealed. The angel trumpeters then, who are here
   mentioned, are those who were appointed to direct the plagues of the
   trumpets, while men were employed in the performance, by whom it
   pleased God to execute his decrees. The four first of these trumpets
   are the cause of the less extensive and minor plagues, inasmuch as they
   were those during which, while they hung over the greatest part of the
   Western, or Latin world, the Roman bishop was to be healed, and from
   that time to become at least the head of that world. For rightly
   applying the images of which, here likewise let the reader observe,
   that the Roman community is secretly assimilated by the Holy Spirit
   with the other empires of the world, to a mundane system, whose parts
   are the earth, sea, rivers, heaven, and stars; in such a way that the
   system of every empire may have its earth likewise, which is like the
   ground itself, a low substance, and the basis on which the mass of the
   whole political structure rests. Also a sea, which by flowing round its
   earth, may wear altogether the similitude of a sea; (and this is the
   amplitude or extent of dominion.) Political rivers likewise, which, in
   the manner of other rivers, derive their origin from the sea, and
   return to it again; of which kind are provincial magistrates, and other
   administrators of government, together with the provinces themselves,
   the channels of those rivers. The sun lastly, and other stars in the
   heaven, of supreme power, referring to the sun, moon, and stars, in the
   mundane system. This analogy being observed, the interpretation, as it
   is completely fortified by similar figures of the ancient prophets, so
   it will be easy to be understood, and very apposite in every part to
   the event recorded.

   But what is so often repeated of the third part, as the third part of
   the trees of the earth, the third part of the sea, of the rivers, of
   the heaven, I understand of the bounds of the Roman empire, embracing
   in its circuit the third part of the world, as it was known in the time
   of John. Which appears capable of being proved from this circumstance,
   that afterwards, in chap. xii. "the seven-headed ten-horned dragon,"
   (that is, the heathen Roman empire), is said to have drawn "a third
   part of the stars of heaven with his tail, and cast them to the earth;"
   that is, to have subjected a third part of the princes and dynasties of
   the world to his dominion. These things being premised, let us come to
   the interpretation of particulars.

   C. viii. v. 7. "And the first angel sounded, and there came hail and
   fire mingled with blood, and it was cast upon the earth, and a third
   part of the trees was burnt up, and every green herb was burnt
   up."--"And the second angel sounded, and as it were, a great mountain
   burning with fire, was cast into the sea, and a third part of the sea
   became blood. And a third part of the creatures in the sea, which had
   life, died, and a third part of the ships was destroyed."--"And the
   third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star burning
   like a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon
   the fountains of waters. And the name of the star was Wormwood, and a
   third part of the waters became as wormwood, and many men died of he
   waters because they were embittered."--"And the fourth angel sounded,
   and the third part of the sun was stricken, and the third part of the
   moon, and the third part of the stars; so that the third part of them
   was darkened, and the day shone not as to a third part of it, and the
   night likewise."
     __________________________________________________________________

   The First Trumpet.

   The first trumpet of the seventh seal begins from the final disturbance
   and overthrow of the Roman idolarchy at the close of the sixth seal;
   and as it was to bring the first plague on the empire, now beginning to
   fall, it lays waste the third part of the earth, with a horrible storm
   of hail mingled with fire and blood; that is, it depopulates the
   territory and people of the Roman world, (viz. the basis and ground of
   its universal polity) with a terrible and bloody irruption of the
   northern nations, and overthrows and destroys the nobles and plebeians.
   You may see the image of hail, referring in the same manner to a
   hostile invasion in Isaiah, c. xxviii. v. 2. "Behold a strong and
   mighty one from the Lord, (he alludes to Salmanasser,) as a tempest of
   hail, and a whirlwind of destruction, as a flood of many waters,
   overflowing, he shall cast down mightily on the earth. The crown of
   pride, the drunken of Ephraim, shall be trodden under his feet." Also
   Isaiah, c. xxx. v. 30, of the slaughter to come on the Assyrians: "And
   the Lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall show the
   descent of his arm in the indignation of his anger, and in the flame of
   a consuming fire, in dispersion and tempest, and hailstones; for at the
   voice of the Lord shall the Assyrian be beaten down," &c. Here it is to
   be observed, that hail is usually accompanied with thunder, especially
   in the warmer regions. Therefore fire is joined with the mention of
   hail, both here, in St. John, and in Isaiah, and in the eighteenth
   Psalm, ver. 13, 14. Nay, in the Scripture history likewise, Exod. c.
   ix. v. 23. But John mixes blood with it likewise, that he may point out
   by this index, that the whole image relates to slaughter.--Let the
   reader likewise consult Isaiah, c. xxxii. v. 19, with regard to the
   image of hail, and the Chaldee paraphrast upon it. Moreover, the same
   paraphrast teaches us that trees, in prophetic parables, signify the
   great and rich, who for oaks of Basan (Isaiah xi. 13.) substitutes the
   princes of provinces; for cedars, (Isaiah xiv. 8.) rich men; for
   fir-trees, sometimes princes, (Isaiah xxxvii. 24.) sometimes kings,
   (Isaiah xiv. 8.) Who likewise paraphrases that passage of Zechariah xi.
   2. "Howl, fir-tree; for the cedar is fallen! because the mighty are
   spoiled. Howl, ye oaks of Basan, for the fenced forest is fallen! Howl,
   ye kings, for your princes are debased; ye who were rich in wealth are
   spoiled. Howl, satraps of provinces, for the region of your strength is
   laid waste." Whence, by analogy, it is easily collected, that herbs are
   to be taken for the common people, when, as in this place, they are
   connected with trees.

   Now, in order to collect something respecting the event from history, I
   would deduce the beginning of this trumpet (until something more
   certain shall be established) from the death of Theodosius the First;
   that is, from the year of Christ 395; because then the Christian
   religion seems to have plainly triumphed over the gods of the Gentiles;
   and at the same time, as combined in a certain common term with the end
   of the former, and with the beginning of the present seal, the
   irruptions of the Barbarians having in a small degree been attempted
   before, but been repressed in the ensuing years, when the empire was
   again at peace, began at length to take place in a horrible manner, and
   to hang over the whole Roman world, continually and cruelly wasting and
   depopulating it with fire and sword.

   For in this very year, Alaric first, with an immense army of Goths and
   other barbarians, broke into Macedonia, from Thrace, sparing neither
   towns nor inhabitants. From thence, proceeding through Thessaly, and
   having occupied the straits of Thermopylae, he descended into Greece,
   that is, into Attica, and overthrew every city except Thebes and
   Athens. He made an irruption into Peloponnesus, and laid waste Corinth,
   Argos, and Sparta. From thence he invaded Epirus, where he proceeded to
   commit the same depopulations and devastations. In the following year,
   quitting Epirus, he made an incursion into Achaia, and basted to
   despoil it shamefully, together with Epirus and the neighbouring
   provinces, by burnings and depopulations. When he had thus, for five
   years, harassed the east with his cruel ravages, he turned his
   attention to the invasion of the west, passed into Dalmatia and
   Pannonia, and laid waste those regions far and wide.

   Hear Jerome, who was then alive, deploring the very distressed state of
   this period, while the tempest was still assailing it. Epist. III.
   "Between Constantinople and the Julian Alps, Roman blood is every day
   shed. Scythia, Thrace, Macedonia, Dardania, Dacia, Thessaly, Achaia,
   Epirus, Dalmatia, and all Pannonia, the Goths, the Sarmatians, the
   Quadi, the Alans, Huns, Vandals, and Marcomani, invade and seize. How
   many matrons, how many virgins of God, and free-born and noble persons,
   are become the sport of these brute beasts! Bishops are taken captive,
   priests slain, and the functions of divers clergymen suspended!
   Churches are subverted, horses are stabled at the altars of Christ, the
   relics of martyrs are dug up. The whole Roman world falls to pieces.
   What courage do you suppose at this moment is possessed by the
   Corinthians, Athenians, Lacedemonians, Arcadians, and all Greece, over
   whom the barbarians rule?"

   In the following year, A.D. 401, the same Alaric, with Goths, Alans,
   and Huns following his footsteps, when he was preparing to carry the
   war into Italy, broke through Noricum, and entered Venetia through the
   forest of Trent, reduced those cities in a short time under his power,
   and besieged the emperor Honorius at Hasta; so that almost all men in
   Italy were beginning to think of changing their habitations. But here
   at length, Stilico, the general of Honorius, having prepared a great
   army, checked his fury, and forced him to trace back his steps into
   Pannonia, from whence he had come, after he had been more than once
   conquered and worn out by disadvantageous battles. From whence, a short
   time after, having entered into a league, and being honoured by
   Honorius with a military prefecture, he withdrew into Illyrium, a
   province of the east.

   While Alaric was quiet for a short time, that the west might not from
   thenceforth enjoy an hour of rest, immediately after, in the year 404,
   another memorable irruption of the barbarians was prepared against
   Italy, Radagaisus, a Scythian, being their leader, who with an army of
   Goths, Sarmatians, and Germans, to the amount of two hundred thousand,
   having overthrown the garrisons in the Alps, passed into the territory
   of Venetia, Emilia, and Etruria, and laid siege to Florence, where
   being conquered by Stilico with an immense slaughter, he was taken and
   beheaded. This enemy, however terrible, having been removed in a short
   space of time, and with little loss, soon after, in the year 406, the
   third, that most grievous and very destructive irruption of the Vandals
   and Alans into the west, took place, accompanied by the Marcomanni,
   Heruli, Suevi, Alemanni, Burgundiones, and a rabble of other
   barbarians, by which Gallia first, and from thence Hispania, and lastly
   Africa, were taken possession of, and afflicted with calamities of
   every kind, which destructions Jerome partly expressed and partly
   implied in his second epistle. "Innumerable and very fierce nations,"
   says he, "have occupied all the Gallias: Whatever is between the Alps
   and the Pyrenees, what is included by the ocean and the Rhone, the
   Quadian, the Vandal, the Sarmatian, the Alans, the Gipedes, the Heruli,
   Saxon, Burgundian, Allman, and Pannonian enemies have laid waste.
   Magunciacum [16] has been taken and overthrown, and in the church many
   thousand of men have been butchered. The Vangiones [17] have been
   exterminated in a long siege. The city of the Rheni [18] , though very
   strong, the Ambiani, the Atrebates [19] , Morini [20] , Tornace [21] ,
   the Nemeta [22] , and Argentorati [23] , have been translated into
   Germany. Aquitania, the country of the Nine People, the provinces of
   Lyons and Narbonne, except a few cities, have been wholly depopulated.
   I cannot make mention of Tolosa [24] without tears, which the merits of
   the holy bishop Exuperius, up to this period, contributed to preserve
   from ruin. The provinces of Spain are even now trembling, as just ready
   to perish. Rome redeems its life by gold. And this was that terrible
   cloud of hail mingled with fire and blood; an image, indeed, of so
   obvious an application, that I cannot help referring to Nicephorus of
   Gregora, in book ii. c. vii. never thinking of the Apocalypse, but
   treating of the Scythians; and yet what fell from him is so suitable to
   this subject. As,' says he, terrors from heaven are often excited in
   men by God, as lightnings, fires, and frequent rains, &c. so these
   northern and hyperborean terrors are reserved by God, that they may be
   let forth for punishment, when and by whom it may seem right to
   Providence.'"

   But let me add likewise the corollary from Achmet, for the farther
   confirmation of the Reader.

   Corollary taken out of Achmet, of the signification of Hail, Fire, and
   Trees, in the interpretation of Dreams.

   Chap. cxci. Of the Explanations of the Indians, Persians, and
   Egyptians.

   "Snow, hail, and cold portend troubles, anxieties, and torments."

   "If any one thought he saw hail fallen on any spot, let him expect a
   sudden hostile attack."

   "If he thought he saw hail that injured the stalks of wheat or barley,
   in that place, as far as the stalks are broken, will warlike slaughters
   ensue."

   To the same purpose is Chap. clxix. Of the Divination of the Indians;
   Chap. clx. Of the Explication of the Persians and the Egyptians.

   "Fire signifies death, war, battles, punishment, and affliction, if any
   thing or person had been seen to burn."

   Also in Chap. cli. The Persians, Indians, and Egyptians interpret Trees
   by Men, principally Magistrates, Noblemen, and very illustrious men.

   "If any one has seen trees watered and flourishing, a very eminent man
   and the people will be fostered."

   "If a king has seemed to himself to have planted trees, he will appoint
   new magistrates." Also,

   "If trees by length of time become injured and rotten, the nobles of
   the king will die a natural death."

   "If he has thought he saw shrubs which grew up into trees, this refers
   to the promotion of his great men."

   "If he has thought he saw the leaves of trees collected into his house,
   wealth shall be gained from the great in the manner of leaves," &c.

   The Second Trumpet.

   The second trumpet which ushers in ruin on the Roman world by a heavier
   plague, it being already laid waste as to its land, assails the sea;
   the third part of which, and what belongs to it, it renders entirely
   bloody, by the fall of a great mountain threatening it of old, but now
   set on fire, together with a great slaughter of animals or fishes
   living in it, and of the vessels navigating therein.

   That is, the destruction of Rome, the great city, captured again and
   again, spoiled and burning with hostile flames, broke forth with the
   ruin of the amplitude of the Roman dominion or jurisdiction; the
   barbarians, on account of the weakness of the capital, thus affected,
   now seizing on its provinces, and dividing them into new kingdoms, with
   an irreparable slaughter of the legions at that time remaining for its
   defence, with a loss of all aids of retaining and supporting its power,
   even by negotiation.

   The sea of the political world is, as I have observed, that amplitude
   of dominion which embraces all the inhabitants in the communion of the
   same political laws. By this image the dominion of Babylon is
   expressed, Jer. c. li. v. 36. where the Lord threatens that "He will
   dry up her sea, and make her springs dry;" which ver. 44 explains by
   the retention of the same metaphor, "The nations shall no longer flow
   together to her." The amplitude of the Assyrian kingdom likewise, is
   thus described, Ezek. c. xxxi. v. 4. "The waters have made her to
   increase;" (that is, the Assyrian cedar,) "the abyss or the sea has
   exalted her." Perhaps the dominion of Pharaoh is the sea. Isa. c. xix.
   v. 5. It is said of the destruction of his kingdom, "The waters of his
   sea should fail;" that is, his empire should be taken away. Therefore
   those great empires are seen by Daniel "ascending out of the sea;" that
   is, arising out of the circumference of dominion.

   But as "the third part of the sea," that is, of the Roman sea, is said
   to have become bloody, it is to be understood that blood is used in the
   first place for slaughter, and then for death, even without blood.
   Death is to be taken generally for destruction, even of a substance
   without life. Vide Ezek. c. xiv. v. 19. and c. iii. v. 18. 20. and c.
   xviii. v. 13. Amos, c. ii. v. 2. Rom. c. vii. v. 9. Whence blood, or to
   become bloody, is the image which has suffered destruction, as if it
   were like an animal slain or butchered, dropping with gore. When,
   therefore, it is said here that the sea is made bloody by the overthrow
   of a great mountain, it denotes nothing else than that it should suffer
   some kind of death, or violent extinction by that event. What is said
   in the vials, where there is the same image, is a little more
   clear,--"it became as the blood of a dead man." The meaning is, that
   the Roman dominion, or extent of power, suffered ruin, was mangled,
   dismembered, and destroyed.

   The like symbol of a mountain, signifying a city, is to be found of
   ancient Babylon, in Jer. c. li. v. 25, "Behold I am against thee, O
   destroying (or corrupting) mountain, saith the Lord, which destroyeth
   (or corrupteth) all the earth, and I will stretch out my hand,--and
   will make thee a burnt mountain, (or a mountain of combustion,)" where
   the Septuagint has oros empuriomenon a burning mountain, in the same
   sense in which John uses it here, oros puri kaiomenon a mountain
   burning with fire. Of the same Isaiah says, c. xiii. v. 2, "Lift ye up
   a banner on the high mountain." The Targum has it, "On the city which
   dwelleth confidently." Again, c. cxxxvii. v. 24, to Sennacherib, king
   of Assyria, "Thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the
   multitude of my chariots have I ascended to the height of the
   mountains:" The Targum, "Have I ascended into their fortified cities."
   But whether rightly, I doubt.

   Moreover, that a mountain should here be said to be cast into the sea,
   is a proper figure, because, by no other means could a mountain hurt
   the sea, than by being cast into it. And this you will remember,
   likewise, takes place in the following trumpet of the falling star.

   With relation to history, Rome was first captured in the year 410 by
   the same Alaric, king of the Goths, who in the former trumpet had
   exhibited, as it were, a prelude of its fate. But now, after the death
   of Stilico, exciting new disturbances, and setting on foot a new and
   fatal expedition against Italy, by which he reduced Honorius to such
   straits, that the barbarian himself gave to Rome a new emperor of the
   name of Attalus, with whom he besieged Honorius Augustus at Ravenna,
   who was already meditating from the desperate state of his affairs, to
   fly into the east, and to abandon the west. But the enemy, induced by
   his submission, and Attalus having abdicated the empire, restored
   Honorius to his power.

   The dismemberment of the Roman empire followed immediately the
   destruction of Rome. I call Sigonius as a witness, who says, "The
   miserable devastation of Italy, continual wars with Gaul and Spain, and
   at length, new regal governments of barbarians in both provinces,
   followed the destruction of Rome."

   For, in the first place, Honorius, in order to recover the possession
   of Rome with the empire, having made a league with Alaric, was
   compelled to grant settlements to the Goths, and a kingdom in the
   Gallias. Two years after, in the year 412, the Huns pouring into
   Pannonia, which the Goths had left, lie being destitute of sufficient
   force to make resistance, under such difficulties, entered into a
   treaty with them, giving and accepting hostages.

   Then in the year 413, Constantius, the general of the same Honorius,
   that he might not accidentally fall into any warlike difficulty,
   willingly received the Burgundians into amity, and assigned them seats
   on the Rhone, who in the preceding years had thrown themselves into
   Gaul with the Vandals.

   Lastly, in the year 415, the same Honorius, (as Procopius relates,)
   when the Goths, a little while after, had passed into the neighbouring
   part of Spain, granted to the Vandals likewise, with their king
   Gunderic, who had lately been expelled from Gaul by the Franks, the
   habitation they had occupied, under the engagement of waging war with
   the Goths.

   He who desires to know more may consult the beforenamed Sigonius on the
   western empire, books x. and xi. from whence we have quoted these
   particulars.

   And thus, from henceforth, the extent of the Roman dominion was daily
   more and more mangled and dismembered, until Rome being again taken and
   sacked in the year 455 by Genseric, the Vandal, in the year immediately
   following, or in rather less time, the whole body of the empire
   appeared to be divided into ten kingdoms in all; which, together with
   the names of the people, and kings, and the provinces over which they
   reigned, the following little table will exhibit, together with some
   illustrations from history, to throw greater light upon the subject.

   And in this manner, at length, those ten kingdoms, into which the Holy
   Spirit had predeclared, both by Daniel and St. John, that the Roman
   empire should be divided in the latter days, seem to be made out, and
   are not altogether to be estimated by the bare names of so many
   regions, or tracts of the earth, as is commonly done, but by kingdoms,
   into which the extent and dominion of the empire was to be forcibly
   torn asunder.

   In the mean time, however, we do not think that the circumscription of
   this denary is to be so rigidly interpreted, as to exclude more
   kingdoms at any one time, or dynasties of some kind or other; but that
   the empire was to be rent into ten kingdoms, at least, or into ten
   principal kingdoms. Which, from the original declaration which we have
   now represented, down even to the present age, under so many fates and
   changes of republics and kingdoms, I believe to have been always true;
   though it might be sufficient to confirm the truth of the oracle, if it
   had only been divided in the beginning into so many kingdoms, though
   afterwards, perhaps, the number had diminished.

   Now that this circumscription of the decad of kingdoms is to be
   understood in the manner which I have stated, and not otherwise, the
   similar prophecy respecting the division of the Alexandrian monarchy
   may teach us. In which, though over and above those four principal
   kingdoms of Macedonia, Asia, Syria, and Egypt, a fifth was added,
   namely, that of Thrace, by its founder Lysimachus, yet the Holy Spirit
   defined that multiplicity by a quaternion, suggesting there would be so
   many at least, or so many principal kingdoms. For the Thracian kingdom,
   though it began at the same time with the rest, and lasted forty years,
   yet had no successor, but expired with the first king, Lysimachus, and
   therefore is not to be referred to the number.

   In like manner we are to judge of this tenfold Roman division.
   Therefore, let no one be surprised, if, beside the kingdom enumerated
   in the Gallias, he should possibly find that of the Aurelian Alani, and
   also the dynasty of the Armoric States, remaining even from the reign
   of Honorius to these times. The latter, indeed, he will find to have
   been of very moderate extent, and the former to have lasted for a very
   short space of time, (or not more than ten years.) Neither, then, is to
   be reckoned in the same place and order as the rest, though otherwise
   something of the same nature may be discovered.

   but to make up correctly the No. 10, the dominion of the Ostrogoths was
   divided at that time into two kingdoms; Pannonia having been subject to
   them, being occupied by the Longobards, and Italy alone left to the
   King of the Ostrogoths.

   destroyed the kingdom of the Ostrogoths, being called forth in 567,
   they gave up their seats in Pannonia to the Huns and Avari.
   10. Greeks In the remainder of the dominion of the empire. Sinc the
   ancient empire of Rome being dissolved, that of the Greeks is to be
   enumberated among the kingdoms into which it was broken to pieces

   The Third Trumpet.

   The third trumpet wholly overthrew and extinguished that burning star,
   the Roman Hesper, or Cæsar of the West, which fell headlong from the
   time when Genseric, king of the Vandals, pillaged the captured city of
   Rome; though, for a little time, to contend with death under those
   merely nominal Cæsars,--Avitus, Majorianus, Severus, Anthemius,
   Olybrius, Glycerius, and Nepos, who perished by mutual treacheries and
   murders, at length, in the year 476, drawing its last breath under the
   fatal name of Augustulus, was entirely hurled from the heaven of his
   power by Odoacer, king of the Heruli, who had fallen upon him, with a
   very bitter calamity to the fountains and rivers, that is, to the
   cities and provincial magistrates.

   By the Hesperian Cæsar I understand him, who, from the confirmed
   division of the empire into eastern and western, even from the death of
   Theodosius the First, yet remained emperor of ancient Rome, and of the
   West, but for a very short period, as, after the year 91, he began
   secretly to fall from his heaven at the sound of this trumpet. For
   though the Roman bishop, more than 320 years after the Hesperian Cæsar
   had fallen in Augustulus, substituted the king of the Franks, (and
   afterwards of the Germans) in the same name and title, he did nothing
   else but contrive, that by this drawn-curtain of a revived Cæsar, or
   the sixth head of the beast, he himself might not be so clearly
   perceived by the less perspicacious, to be the last head, that is,
   Anti-Christ.

   The Papal Cæsar, however, does not appertain to the heads of the Roman
   beast, but to the horns or kingdoms, into which the empire of the sixth
   head, just ready to give place to the last head, were to be divided.
   For, after so long a space as 325 years [25] , there could not be a
   succession, as in continuation of the western Cæsars.

   But it is time now to throw light on the text of John, that the
   reasonableness of the interpretation may appear. "And there fell from
   heaven, (says he,) a great star, burning as a lamp." He seems to
   describe a hairy star, or comet, among whose species is enumerated by
   Pliny the Lampadias, or blazing star, especially so called. And indeed,
   the Cæsar of the West might not unaptly be designated by a star of this
   kind, on account of his brief duration. Of whom it is said, c. xviii.
   "And when he cometh, he must continue a short space." But the star was
   great, in order more aptly to figure the supreme majesty, whose
   splendour the sun, in other places, represents in prophetic parables.
   And it is very well known that there have been comets, which seemed to
   equal even the sun in magnitude, of which kind, perhaps, he will not be
   in an error, who affirms this star to have been one. But that you may
   not entertain a doubt of the application, Isaiah applies a similar
   image of a falling star, c. xiv. v. 12, to the fall of the king of
   Babylon. "How (says he) hest thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of
   the morning! How art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the
   nations [26] !" In other places likewise, as in that passage of Isaiah,
   c. xxxiv. v. 4, just now quoted, stars falling from heaven are
   understood of the ruin of princes and nobles. A star, therefore, of a
   singular and unusual magnitude, designates a prince above the common
   lot of princes, that is, great and illustrious. It follows: "And the
   name of the star is called Wormwood." It is the prophetic plan, that
   the quality or fate of the thing or person of which it treats should be
   pointed out by the imposition of a certain proper name, since there are
   other instances in the Hebrew language where rhema, dvr, is the same as
   to pragma, that is, the word signifies the thing, as Luke c. i. v. 37,
   "There is not any word impossible with God [27] ," to be called
   signifies the same as to be or exist, as Isaiah c. lvi. v. 7, "My house
   shall be called the house of prayer," for which Luke has, c. xix. v. 4,
   "My house is, (that is, shall be accounted,) the house of prayer." And
   Gen. c. xxi. v. 12, "In Isaac shall thy seed be called," that is,
   "shall be." See likewise the Septuagint Isa. c. xiv. v. 20. Ruth, c.
   iv. v. 11.

   But examples of the figure which I have noticed are every where to be
   met with. For thus says Isaiah, c. vii. v. 14, "His name shall be
   called Emmanuel [28] ;" that is, He shall be theanthropos, God-man; and
   c. ix. v. 6, "His name shall be called Wonderful, the Counsellor, the
   Mighty God, the Father of the world to come, the Prince of Peace;" that
   is, he shall be all these. Also Jerem. c. xxiii. v. 6, "And this is the
   name by which he shall be called, The Lord our Righteousness;" and
   Zech. c. vi. v. 12, "Behold a man whose name is the Branch." It
   follows, "For he shall grow up out of his place," &c. add Rev. c. xix.
   v. 13, "His name is called the Word of God." Akin to these examples are
   what we find in Jer. c. xx. v. 3, 4, "The Lord doth not call thy name
   Pashur, but Magor Missabib, (i. e. fear on every side). "For thus saith
   the Lord, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself and all thy
   friends;" and Ezek. c. xxiii. v. 4, "Their names (i. e. the names of
   Samaria and Jerusalem) are Aholah and Aholibah." Add Isa. c. viii.
   Hosea, c. i. 6, 7. By a similar figure in every respect, is this fallen
   star called Wormwood; that is, according to the Hebrew notion, (by
   which abstracts are used for concretes,) Absinthites, or the prince of
   bitterness and troubles. Of this kind in truth, if ever there was one,
   was that Hesperian Cæsar, exercised with perpetual troubles from his
   first rise to his end; during whose possession of power the Roman
   empire was ready to fall; nay, in whose appointment was given an
   occasion of falling, because in the division of empire thus introduced,
   a way was opened for the barbarians, and the Roman commonwealth was
   exposed to the most dreadful calamities. Might not he be properly
   called Wormwood, on account of a fate so bitter to himself and others?
   According to that saying of Naomi, "Call me not Naomi, call me Marah;
   for the Almighty has afflicted me with bitterness," Ruth c. i. v. 20.

   But before I quit this subject, something must be said of the state of
   the city and the Roman commonwealth, that the way may be prepared for
   the interpretation of the following trumpet.

   The Cæsar of the West, then, being thus overthrown and extinct, in the
   mean time Odoacer, king of the Heruli, held Rome for sixteen years
   under the name of king, who, after two years restored, and from that
   time preserved, the consulate to Rome and the West, which in his anger
   he had at first taken away. Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths,
   succeeded him, and that, as Paul the Deacon relates, by Zeno, the
   emperor of the East, delivering Italy to him in a formal manner, and
   confirming it by the imposition of the second veil on his head. He,
   after Odoacer was conquered and slain, besides Dalmatia and Rhetia,
   which were provinces of Odoacer, added Sicily also to his kingdom,
   rebuilt the walls, and some of the edifices of the city of Rome, having
   collected a large sum of money for that purpose; so that nothing seemed
   to be wanted to its attainment of its former state, except the infamy
   of a city plundered and burned. He regulated the kingdom most wisely;
   he changed no Roman institution, but retained the senate and consuls,
   the patricians, prefects of the prætorium, prefect of the city,
   questor, commissary of the sacred largesses, offices of the privates,
   and of the military, masters of the foot and horse, and the other
   magistrates, who were then in the empire, and entrusted the offices
   only to Romans. Which regulations were for some time continued by his
   successors also, Athalaric, Theodostratus, and Vitiges, Ostrogoth kings
   of Italy.--Vide Sigonius on the Western Empire, Lib. xv. Anno, 479,
   Lib. xvi. Annis, 493, 494, 500.

   The Fourth Trumpet.

   The fourth trumpet having advanced a little farther, proceeded to take
   away entirely the light of Roman majesty in the city -of Rome, with
   which it had hitherto shone under the Ostrogoth kings, after the
   consulate of Rome had failed;- namely, from the year 452, in that
   Ostrogothic war, waged first by Belisarius, and then by Narses, general
   of Justinian, for the purpose of recovering Italy: And then the city
   itself, having been repeatedly taken by Totila, burnt, and a third of
   it demolished, deprived, moreover, of all its inhabitants, (a memorable
   sport of fortune!) being recovered at length by Narses, after so many
   deaths and so much slaughter, was thrown down -a short time after by a
   whirlwind and thunderbolts. Once the queen of cities, but now at length
   deprived of the consular power, of the authority of the senate, and of
   the other magistrates, with which, as stars, she had hitherto
   irradiated the globe, she fell from such splendour of glory into I know
   not what ignoble Duchy of Ravenna, over which she had formerly ruled,
   and was afterwards compelled (what obscurity!) to be subject to the
   Exarchy, and to pay tribute.

   And this was that percussion of "the third part of the sun, and of the
   moon, and of the stars," by which it came to pass that "a third part of
   the day did not shine, and likewise a third part of the night." Where
   the diurnal light, which is that of the sun, is called by the name of
   day, and the nocturnal light of the moon and stars, by that of night.
   Like that in Jerem. c. xxxi. v. 35, "Who giveth the sun for the light
   of the day, and the ordinances of the moon and the stars for a light by
   night."

   The sun shone at Rome as long as the consular dignity and the kingdom
   was possessed of authority over other cities and provinces. The moon
   and the stars shone there, as long as the ancient power of the senate,
   and of the other magistrates, remained. But these being all taken away,
   (which was done by this trumpet,) what was there but darkness, and a
   universal failure of light, both diurnal and nocturnal? namely, what
   belonged to that city, to which a third part of the light of heaven was
   attributed.

   The image of the sun, moon, and stars, in this sense, is very frequent
   with the prophets. As Isaiah, c. xiii. v. 10, also c. lx. v. 20, where,
   instead of "Thy sun shall no more set, and thy moon shall not be
   diminished," the Targum has, "Thy kingdom (it is addressed to
   Jerusalem) shall no more cease, and thy glory shall not be withdrawn."
   Also, Jerem. c. xv. v. 9, where of Jerusalem he says, "Her sun is set,
   while it is yet day," the Targum translates it, "Their glory has
   departed during their lives." And Ezek. c. xxxii. v. 7, the same
   paraphrast turns that passage concerning Pharaoh--"And when I shall
   extinguish thee, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof
   dark"--"Tribulation shall cover thee, when I shall extinguish the
   splendour of the glory of thy kingdom." The reader may transfer hither
   also the observations I have made above from Achmet, in order to throw
   light on the sixth seal. It is wonderful how they agree.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Of the Three Woe Trumpets.

   There still remain three trumpets, the greatest and most grievous of
   all, and therefore discriminated from the former by the appellation of
   Woes. For after the conclusion of the fourth trumpet, "I saw and
   heard," says he, "an angel flying in the midst of heaven, and saying
   with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabitants of the earth, by
   reason of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels, which
   are yet to sound." Also, c. ix. v. 12, and c. xi. v. 14.

   Doubtless, since the Christian inhabitants of the Roman world, whilst
   the other trumpets were sounding, had contaminated themselves with the
   worship of new idols, the trumpets which remained were made more
   important for the purpose of punishing the double sin. For, it is
   apparent, that this sin, likewise, of the Roman world, together with
   the former one, of the slaughter of the martyrs, was reckoned in the
   account of the crime to be avenged, because this enunciation is
   subjoined to the second woe; namely, "The rest of the men which were
   not killed by these plagues, repented not of the works of their hands,
   that they should not worship demons, and idols of gold and silver, and
   brass and stone, and wood, which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk,"
   c. ix. v. 20.

   The First Woe Trumpet, or Trumpet the Fifth.

   The first woe trumpet is long since passed. It sent forth those horrid
   troops of locusts, issuing from the smoke of the Tartarean abyss, now
   opened by the work of Satan, to devastate the globe; that is, the
   Saracens, or Arabs, (a nation as populous and numerous as locusts,)
   were excited to the destruction of so many nations, by the astonishing
   false prophecy of Mohammed.

   For the smoke ascending from the infernal pit is Mohammedism, which the
   Mohammedan knaves call Islamism. This covered the whole earth with a
   new obscurity, long since illuminated by the empire and discipline of
   Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, after the darkness of the Gentiles
   had been dispersed. And the type of locusts is the more exact, because
   the Egyptian locusts likewise , came from the same Arabia, bordering on
   Egypt to the east. For thus says Exodus, c. x. vv. 13, 14, "The Lord
   brought an east wind on the land, and it brought the locusts; and the
   locusts went up upon all the land Of Egypt, and settled in all the
   coasts of Egypt." The Arabs, besides, on account of the remarkable
   multitude of the nation, are compared to locusts. Judges, c. vii. v.
   12, "The Midianites and Amalekites, and all the sons of Kedem, or of
   the east, lay in the valley as locusts [29] in multitude. Their camels
   were without number, as the sand by the sea shore for multitude." Where
   it is to be observed, that the Arabs are peculiarly denominated the
   sons of the east, as Arabia itself is kdm Kedem, or the east; namely,
   with respect to Egypt, where the Israelites had learned to speak thus.
   You may see, Gen. c. x. v. 30, and c. xxv. v. 6. 1 Kings, c. iv. v. 30.
   Isa. c. xi. v. 14. Jer. c. xlix. v. 28, and perhaps Matt. c. ii. v. 1.
   Plainly for the same reason as Asia Minor is at this day called
   Natolia, [30] and Arabia Felix is called by the rest of the Arabians,
   Ayaman, or south, whence the queen of the south, Matt. c. xii. v. 42.
   But this by the way.

   A similar image of locusts is to be seen in Joel, in the two first
   chapters, speaking of the Assyrians and Babylonians, who were about to
   lay waste Judea, from whence he who hath compared the description of
   both, will not deny that the type was borrowed.

   Achmet shows from the use of the east, that the interpretation is to be
   referred to hostile forces; whose words I have thought proper to insert
   in this place. It is thus he writes in chap. ccc. from the sciences of
   the Indians, Persians, and Egyptians: "The locust, no doubt, is
   generally to be referred to a multitude of enemies: For so it is
   recorded in the sacred writings, that locusts by Divine command go
   forth like an army to the devastation of countries." This allusion to
   sacred writings, applies to those of the Indians alone, as well as
   every thing in this book, which seems to imply a knowledge of the
   Christian religion, as will be apparent to the reader. He
   proceeds,--"If any king or person endued with power has dreamed that he
   saw locusts going forth towards a particular region, he may expect in
   that place, a multitude of enemies with great power; and as much injury
   as the locusts have done, so much damage will they occasion."

   Having now then established the image, we will look to the remainder of
   the description.

   "And to them was given power," says ver. 3, "even as the scorpions of
   the earth have power;" "for they had tails like scorpions, and in them
   stings with which they hurt; and their torment was as the torment of a
   scorpion when it striketh a man." That is, they had not only the power
   proper to locusts of eating up and depopulating the countries through
   which they passed, but, what was a kind of prodigy, they had tails like
   scorpions, with the stroke of which, likewise, they diffused poison.
   Wonderful A locust scorpion. But the nature of the evil which it
   implies, the symbol of a serpentine species seems to point out; for the
   scorpion is of the serpent kind. In that resemblance, in which the
   devil first deceived mankind, and turned him away from God, the Holy
   Spirit loves still to introduce him when he is about to deceive men.
   Whence that expression--"The old serpent, which deceiveth the world,"
   c. xii. v. 9, and c. xx. v. 2. The tail, therefore, of a scorpion, with
   the sting, denotes the propagation of that diabolical false prophecy of
   Mohammed, with its whole apparatus, on which the Arabian locusts
   relying, not less than on warlike force, inflicted hurt, alas! wherever
   they went. Nay, this train of foulest errors, the Saracens first, from
   the creation of man, drew after them; and, I believe, no nation before
   them, relying on a similar imposture, in religion, and under the
   pretext of destroying the worship of idols, ever contended for the
   empire of the world.

   But it was said to them, "that they should not hurt the grass of the
   earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only those men who had
   not the seal of God upon their foreheads."

   As to the signification of the particle ei me but only, the sense is
   either exceptive, "that they should not hurt any herb, (for this is the
   meaning ofchortos with the Hellenists,) nor any thing green, nor any
   tree, unless those herbs, trees, and green things only, which were not
   inscribed by the seal of God;" so that men and herbs, and green things,
   mutually explain one another. Or it may be explained not exceptively,
   but in opposition, according to the use of the particle ei me in sacred
   Hellenism, for alla, Matt. c. xii. v. 4, Rom. xiv. v. 14, and
   elsewhere; namely, that it might be said to them, that they were not to
   feed altogether after the manner of common locusts, on herbs or trees,
   nor on any thing green, but above those things to which they were
   accustomed, they were to harass men alone; of the number of those whom
   the seal of the angel, at the beginning of the trumpet, had not
   exempted from those plagues. In whichever mode it be taken, we might
   trouble ourselves in vain about the signification and difference of
   green grass and trees, since those things belong only to the propriety
   of the figure in which a mystery is not to be sought for. For thus it
   is said of the Egyptian locusts, Exod. c. x. v. 15, "They covered the
   face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they
   consumed every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees, and
   there remained not any green thing in any tree or herb of the field
   through all the land of Egypt." But our locusts afflicted the very men,
   and from hence it is apparent that they were not of the genus of
   insects, that is, not natural, but symbolical locusts. On which
   occasion, it will be worth while, once for all, to lay down this
   rule:--Whenever any thing is attributed to the prophetic type, which is
   not agreeable to the nature of the same, that will lead us to the
   understanding of the thing signified by the type, and teach us that the
   interpretation is to be made according to the condition of the thing so
   signified; and this, you will observe, is to be done four times, at
   least, in this vision; as when there is given to locusts not only the
   power of attacking men, but also a human face, feminine hair, golden
   crowns, and iron breast-plates; by all which it is intimated that men
   and not insects are designated; and they, indeed, by no means hooded as
   some suppose [31] , but in all respects such as go forth in arms, for
   the destruction of others. Of which locusts it is said, "And to them it
   was given, that they should not kill men, but that they should torment
   them for five months;" that is, in this respect the Arabian locusts
   differ from the Euphratean horsemen, of whom mention is made in the
   following trumpet. It was given to the Saracens to torment for a long
   time, and in a cruel manner, the nations of the Roman name; but it was
   by no means given to them to despoil of life that Roman triental, if I
   may so call it, on any side. For since, while the former trumpets were
   sounding, out of the ruins of its political state, a new pontifical
   kingdom of ancient Rome had grown up, with a progress equal, as it
   were, to the ruin of the other, the Saracens could not destroy this,
   nor the kingdom of Constantinople, the new Rome. On the other hand, the
   Turks, after the capture of the royal city, entirely took away the
   Constantinopolitan dominion, as we shall hear in the following trumpet.
   Of the five months to which the torment of the locusts is limited, we
   shall speak with more propriety when we come to the repetition of the
   same.

   "In those days men shall seek death, and shall not find it. And they
   shall desire to die,. and death shall flee from them." That is, such
   shall be the calamity of those times, that men shall be weary of their
   lives. For you are not to imagine that this was done by mere
   persuasion, or tricks of delusion. The business was effected by arms,
   and that by the institution of Mohammed himself; the apparatus of
   which, indeed, and it is sufficiently terrible, together with the
   amplitude of the dominion to be acquired, and the dress of the nation
   waging war, is depicted in a lively image. The warlike apparatus is
   thus described: "And the figures of the locusts were like horses (i. e.
   cavalry) prepared for battle;" "their teeth were like those of lions,"
   i. e. strong to devour. Joel, c. i. v. 6. Dan. c. vii. v. 7. 23. "And
   they had breast-plates like breast-plates of iron, and the sound of
   their wings was as the sound of chariots with many horses rushing to
   battle." The whole description is taken from Joel, from whence, as I
   observed, is borrowed the very image of locusts. Vide c. ii. v. 4. c.
   i. v. 6. c. ii. v. 5.

   The crowns, like crowns of gold, placed on their heads, indicate the
   success and extent of dominion to be acquired nor indeed undeservedly.
   No nation ever reigned so extensively, nor in so short a space of time
   were so many kingdoms, so many regions, brought under the yoke of
   domination. Incredible is it to be told, yet it is most true, that in
   the short space of eighty, or not many more years, they subjugated and
   acquired to the diabolical kingdom of Mohammed, Palestine, Syria, both
   the Armenias, almost the whole of Asia Minor, Persia, India, Egypt,
   Numidia, all Barbary, as far as the river Niger, Lusitania, and
   Hispania. Nor did their good fortune or ambition stop here, till they
   had added great part of Italy, even to the gates of Rome, besides
   Sicily, Candia, Cyprus, and the other islands of the Mediterranean Sea.

   Good God! what a vast tract of land! How many crowns are here! Whence
   it is worthy of observation, that no mention is here made, as under the
   other trumpets, of the trient, or third part; since the plague fell not
   less beyond the bounds of the Roman empire, than within it; stretching
   even to the extremest parts of India.

   The dress of this warlike nation remains to be considered. "And their
   faces," says he, "were as the faces of men." They were locusts with a
   human countenance; that is, truly men, (lest any one should suppose
   that insects were spoken of,) "having hair as the hair of women;" that
   is, they were Arabs by nation, who, according to Pliny, wear their hair
   uncut, and in the manner of women, having turbans on their heads.
   Pliny, lib. vi. c. 28. Whose custom it is at the present day, as
   travellers affirm, when they are going into battle, to braid their hair
   into horns and curls. Camerar. operum subciss. Tom. i. c. 93. Whence it
   appears manifest that a passage quoted from Herodotus in Thalia, as
   implying the tonsure of the Arabs, is not to be understood as of the
   shaving of the head, but either of that of the beard, in some mode used
   by the Arabs, in imitation of Bacchus, (of which Pliny also mentions
   something, when he says, "the beard was wont to be shaved by them,
   except upon the upper lip,") or of the roundness of the ends of their
   hair, beyond the entire tonsure of the head both of which modes
   perhaps, because it was the mark of the worshippers of Bacchus, a
   Heathen deity near them, God forbad to his people. Levit. c. xix. v.
   27. c. xxi. v. 5. However it might be, I doubt not but Pliny had seen
   Arabians at Rome.

   It follows, with regard to the duration of the plague, that it is to be
   actually terminated in five months, according to the type of locusts,
   who last for so many months namely, from the rising of the pleiades,
   (called by the ancients the end of spring, being about one month from
   the vernal equinox,) when, from the eggs left in the earth, during
   winter, they come forth to the light, until the beginning of autumn,
   when, having deposited other eggs in the earth for the stock of the
   next year, they immediately die. See Pliny, lib. xi. c. 29.

   God, however, intended to suit this notation of time, not only to the
   type, but also to the antitype, since he delivered up Italy, the chief
   state of the earth, and of the sin which drew down the foremost plague,
   to be infested by the Saracenic locusts, from the year 830 to the year
   980, that is, 150 years, or five months of years.

   In other parts of the world indeed, but in a certain order, and for
   different periods of time, the plague remained longer; chiefly in the
   oriental regions of Syria, Egypt, and of Asia Minor, which being
   conterminous to the head of that empire, which was first at Damascus,
   and afterwards at Bagdad, fell, as it were, into the anterior parts of
   the Saracenic body for many ages.

   Here I would observe, that though, in whatever lands they occupied,
   they wounded the inhabitants with the envenomed stroke of that
   scorpion-tail of which I have spoken, yet the Italians seem to have
   felt the stroke in some different, unknown, and singular manner. The
   whole swarm being assimilated to a body, and the anterior parts
   assigned, as they ought to be, to the east, what will those African
   troops be, stretched out at so loose a distance from the head towards
   the west, but the tail? And from thence arose all the calamity of
   Italy, which they repeatedly struck by an oblique stroke (see the
   nature of scorpions) through the Mediterranean sea, as well as its.
   islands of Sardinia and Sicily. As if the Holy Spirit expressly pointed
   hither when it said, with the reiterated mention of months, "And they
   had tails like scorpions, and stings, and they had power in their tails
   to hurt men five months." For so reads the Cornplutensian Codex,
   according to the testimony of Syrus, Primasius, Andreas, and Aretas.
   Though an interpretation of this kind be not unsuitable to the
   designation of the time, yet I do not change my opinion that there is
   another signification of that serpentine train, and much more widely
   diffusing itself, as I have said above. If any one will suffer himself
   to be persuaded of a secondary sense, (which I am not accustomed easily
   to admit,) he is at liberty to adopt it with my consent.

   Now, this is one way by which the five months of the type of locusts
   may be adapted to the event. There is also another, provided those
   months are doubled in consequence of those five months being twice
   mentioned, as if indeed the Holy Spirit meant to apply the number Five
   according to the analogy and propriety of the type; but to double it
   that it might answer by another period, to a more illustrious antitype.
   For why otherwise should he repeat the notation of those months nearly
   in the same words? Is there not a mystery under this repetition? I do
   not remember a similar circumstance elsewhere, in the continued
   description of the same type. If this, then, should be satisfactory,
   three hundred years, as many as twice five months of years amount to,
   will comprehend that noted period of the Saracenic kingdom, which, from
   the beginning of the Caliphate of the Abasides, (who first fixed the
   seat of empire at Bagdad,) extends to the capture of the same city by
   Togrulbec, king of the Turks, (who is called by us Tangrophilix); that
   is, from the year of Christ 750 to the year 1055. This, indeed, is a
   longer space by about five years; but when the calculation is made by
   months, no more notice is to be taken of some days, than, when the
   computation is by days, it is customary to take of hours. It may be
   added, that this interval will begin commodiously from the removal of
   the yoke of the exarchate from the city of Rome, with which the
   calamity of the preceding trumpet ended. It happened at the same time,
   perhaps even in the same year. If you should still inquire why the Holy
   Spirit did not comprehend the whole duration of the Saracenic plague
   within these numbers, since, before this principality of the Abasides,
   namely, from the year 630, the Saracens had extended their empire by
   continued successes; so that it had thus then arisen to its acme? It
   may be answered, that the number of five months has more to do with the
   type of locusts than with the antitype of Saracens, and therefore it
   was sufficient, if what properly suits the former was exhibited in some
   more remarkable kind of period, though it should not measure the whole.
   I assert nothing, however, on this point, but leave it to others to
   whom more has been given by God, to search into it farther. (N.B.) This
   difficulty, notwithstanding, is by no means prejudicial to the
   interpretation respecting the Saracens; for whichever interpretation
   you follow, the same difficulty will pursue you.

   There yet remains to treat of the king, and his name. "And they had,"
   says he, "a king over them, the angel of the abyss." His name in Hebrew
   is Abaddon, and in Greek he has the name of Apollyon, that is, the
   Destroyer.

   The Holy Spirit seems to insinuate, as he calls their king the angel of
   the abyss, that these locusts were not a Christian, but an infidel
   nation, which had not given their name to Christ. For the children of
   infidelity, or Pagans, are said by St. Paul to be subject to the prince
   who had the power "of the air," who is no other than the angel of the
   abyss; on the contrary, those who become Christians are said "to be
   delivered from the power of Satan, and to be converted to God."

   Whatever the reason may be, the matter is worthy discussion, why he
   should call this prince of the abyss by a name evidently new and
   unheard of, and not as he commonly is, the Devil, Satan, the Serpent,
   or Dragon: or if he had given him one from the notion of destroying,
   why not rather Asmodeus, from the name Isodunamounti, by which the Jews
   used to call him, but Abaddon never? Is it not because,

   when the Mohammedans boasted that they worshipped and adored no other
   God than the one and only God, the Creator of all things, or the Maker
   of the Universe, who is denominated Abuda by the Chaldeans and Syrians,
   and is distinguished also by the Arabians themselves by the epithet
   'vdy Abdi, that is, Eternal; the Holy Spirit designed to oppose them
   with a word of a contrary sense, but of similar sound? By which, in
   truth, he intimated, that they were so far from venerating (whatever
   they might assert) Abuda, or Abdi, the Eternal Maker of the World, that
   in the estimation of God himself, whom they will have to be of one
   Person, and not to be approached through Christ, they had, in the place
   of king or deity, not Him, but the evil angel Abaddon, that is, not the
   Maker, but the Destroyer of the world.

   Thus, when the followers of Jeroboam thought that they worshipped the
   God of Israel in their calves, the Scripture says that they sacrificed
   to demons. 2 Chron. c. xi. v. 15. Or shall we say that there is here an
   allusion to the common name of the kings of that portion of Arabia
   whence Mohammed, in the first place, had issued forth with the locusts;
   who from an ancient king, Oboda, referred by them into the number of
   their gods, and from whose sepulchre the name of Oboda remained in a
   region of the Nabatheans, they were thence called Obodæ, by a name of
   power, as the kings of Egypt, Pharaohs and Ptolemies, those of the
   Romans Cæsars, of the Parthians Arsacæ, and the neighbouring kings of
   the Arabs of Petræa, Aretæ? For Stephen of Byzantium, out of the fourth
   book of Urani us, a writer on Arabian affairs, says, "Obodas is a
   country of the Nabatheans, where Obodas the king, whom they made a god,
   was buried. Now, from this circumstance, Strabo and Josephus induce me
   to believe that the kings of that country were from thenceforward
   called by the common name Obodas, the latter of whom commemorates two
   of this name, the one warlike, and too well known to the Jews by the
   slaughter of their king Alexander Jamnenus; whom, in fact, Obodas the
   Arab compelled to fly from Jerusalem, his whole army being slain in the
   region of Galaad, about ninety years before Christ, whom the Jews, not
   undeservedly, by a slight alteration, might have called Abaddon, that
   is, the Destroyer.

   The other king was dull and heavy, the contemporary of Herod the Great,
   whose procurator Syllæus (who administered his affairs according to his
   pleasure) demanded Salome, the sister of Herod, in marriage; but being
   deprived of his wish, and rendered the enemy of Herod, brought him into
   no small dispute with Augustus by his calumnies. Of this Obodas, Strabo
   makes mention more than once in the expedition of Ælius Gallus into
   Arabia, and that with the same mark of dulness, and says he was
   connected by affinity with the neighbouring king Aretas, (and this, as
   I said, was the common name of the kings bordering on Petræa.) From the
   same author it is to be collected, that the more southern kingdom of
   Obodas reached to the Red Sea, which tract of land, I believe, the
   Ismaelites and Saracens inhabited; for certainly it appears that the
   Nabatheans, whose country, by the testimony of Uranius, embraced the
   region of Obodas, were Ismaelites, having obtained that name from
   Nabaioth, the first-born son of Ismael. Josephus adds, that Obodas
   having departed this life, Aretas, by the favour of Augustus, annexed
   his kingdom to his own. If any one being much struck with such a
   coincidence and congruity, shall think that the Holy Spirit applied
   this name Abaddon designedly, that by a certain paranomasia of the
   royal name he might point out that nation whose custom it was to
   designate their kings, and even their gods, by a similar appellation, I
   should think him deserving pardon, especially since both words seem to
   come from the same root, common to the Hebrews and Arabians, although,
   as is also the case in other instances, with a contrary signification,
   and since in the ancient prophets, examples of allusions, not
   altogether dissimilar, sometimes occur. Thus as Isaiah had called
   Christ in ntsr, that is, a branch, St. Matthew transfers to Jesus the
   name of Nazarene, c. ii. ver. ult. You may see likewise Jerem. c. i. v.
   11, 12. Schaked, an almond; Schoked, I watch; Amos, c. viii. v. 2.
   Kajits, a basket of summer fruits, because it comes from Ketz, which
   means the end, &c. And that the Jews of the latter age were not averse
   to agnomina of such a kind, may be proved from this, that just before
   our Saviour's Advent, because Acheron, the river of the infernal
   regions, did not differ in sound from Accaron, a city of Palestine,
   (for so was Ekron anciently pronounced,) from Beelzebub, its god, they
   made a name of Satan, prince of that place, that is, of the infernal
   regions. For hence, as I conjecture, Beelzebub is called in the Gospel
   the Prince of the Demons.

   The Second Woe Trumpet, or Trumpet the Sixth.

   Another woe productive of plagues (which, lamentable to be reflected
   on, still broods over us), calls forth the tetrarchs of the Turks with
   a most numerous body of cavalry, from Euphrates, (where they had long
   rested) to invade the Roman world.

   "Loose," says the voice from the four horns of the altar of incense,
   "the four angels who are bound upon the great river Euphrates." The
   angels are used for the nations over which they were thought to
   preside, by a metonymy not unusual in this book. It appears to be so
   from the circumstance that those who are loosed, immediately, according
   to the direction of the Oracle, are Equestrian armies, sent forth to
   slay men. It commands the angels who had been bound, to be loosed, as
   those who, during the continuance of the former plague, when they burst
   forth on the Roman regions, had been restrained to the Euphrates for so
   many ages, that they might not proceed at will. In the beginning,
   indeed, they advanced a little farther, even to Nice, in Bithynia; but
   Solyman being conquered in the expedition from Jerusalem by the
   Argonautic Christians, they were at length confined to the Euphrates.
   Moreover, the four angels signify so many sultanies, or kingdoms, into
   which the Turks were divided, when, after crossing the Euphrates, they
   poured themselves on the neighbouring tracts of Asia and Syria. These,
   Christopher Richer, from Scilex, a Greek author, thus enumerates:--The
   Asian, the Aleppian, the Damascene, and the Antiochian. The first of
   which, the Asian, or that of Asia Minor, owed its original to
   Cutlumusus, (called, if I am not mistaken, by Elmachinus, by another
   name, that of Sedijduddaula,) a neighbour of that Tangrophilix who
   first took Bagdad. He, on the same authority, when Cesarea in
   Cappadocia was taken and destroyed by the Romans, about the year of
   Christ, 1080, gave birth to the kingdom in the parts of Asia
   conterminous to the Euphrates; the bounds of which, his successor,
   Solyman, enlarged to Nice in Bithynia; but being, conquered by our
   forces in that well-known expedition from Jerusalem, he was compelled
   to give up the whole region which he had acquired, and to retreat to
   the Euphrates. And the seat of this tetrarchy, though elsewhere in the
   beginning, was still, as to its principal part, in the same Cappadocia
   of Iconium.

   The second tetrarchy was the Aleppian, from its metropolis Aleppo,
   which is washed by a branch of the Euphrates, and therefore derived
   from one of the sultans. Its first king (on the authority of
   Elmachinus) Sjarfuddamlas, who was possessed of Aleppo in the year
   1079; to whom succeeded Roduwan Salghucides, in 1095.

   The third tetrarchy, with its metropolis Damascus, had for its founder,
   on the same authority, Tagjuddaulas Nisus, the grandson of Togrulbec,
   or Tangrophilix, who subjugated Damascus in the same year 1079. His
   successor was Ducathes, or Decacus, the brother of Rochewan, the sultan
   of Aleppo, in the year 1095. To whom, says Scilix, the whole region of
   Decapolis was subject. This bordered on the Euphrates. With these
   Scilix numbers the fourth, the Antiochian, contained within narrow
   bounds. For, says he, the caliph of Egypt, of the Saracenic race,
   possessed Laodicea, even to the regions of Syria. But as that kingdom
   of Antioch was not only a little too remote from the Euphrates, but
   lasted only fourteen years, Antioch being taken by our people under
   their leader, Bohemond, it will be better, perhaps, having expunged
   that, to add the Bagdadian, or Persian empire, from the other bank of
   the Euphrates, (for Scilix only took account of the Turks who had
   passed the Euphrates,) in order to complete the quaternion, that so the
   whole Turkish empire, both beyond and on this side of that river,
   should he understood as divided into those four sultanies, which with
   the series for some time of kings and sultans, may be contemplated by
   the reader more distinctly in the following

   DIAGRAM

   Of the Turkish Empire, near the Euphrates, divided into Four Parts,
   from the year 1080, and thenceforward, taken out of Elmachinus, an
   Arab, and Scilix, a Greek Author.

   And that was the state of the Turkish affairs when they had first
   passed the Euphrates; and having given a specimen of their irruption
   into the Roman dominions, were restrained by the appointed chains to
   the Euphrates. However, that quaternion of sultanies did not remain
   entire to the time of relaxation, but underwent several vicissitudes.
   Notwithstanding, the Holy Spirit estimates the nation from the state of
   its first irruption, in which, when they had passed the Euphrates, they
   were bound for an appointed time.

   "And the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour, and a
   day, and a month, and a year, that they might kill a third part of
   men."

   This loosing of the Turks happened a little before the year 1300, the
   caliphate of Bagdad (with which the first woe wholly expired) being now
   extinguished by the Tartars in the year 1258, and the remnant of the
   Turks, who had been possessed of the realms from the other bank of the
   river, even to Persis, being ejected by the same people, as from a
   sling, in the year 1289, on the Roman countries on this side the
   Euphrates. For, things being thus prepared, it happened likewise, at
   the same time, that the Latins, who had now, for almost two hundred
   years, imposed curbs and fetters on the first irruption of the Turks,
   were expelled from Syria and Palestine, about the year 1291. In the
   mean time the Turks, though as yet divided into various satrapies,
   began to make incursions into almost the whole of Asia Minor, to divide
   it among themselves, to be possessed by hereditary right, and at
   length, uniting under the empire of Othman alone, to advance
   astonishingly, and wholly without restraint, to pass over into Europe;
   nor could they longer be resisted by any force, until they had
   destroyed the whole Constantinopolitan empire with miserable
   devastations. But the Oracle (unless I am deceived) points out the time
   of this Constantinopolitan destruction, namely, that it should be after
   a day, a month, and a year; that is, 396 years after the Turks, by the
   gift of the Saracenic empire to them, had began to be prepared by God;
   that is, from the time of Bagdad being captured by them.

   This was the beginning of the Turkish irruption, by which the Saracenic
   empire began to be demolished, and the dominion of the Romans to be
   afflicted; in such a manner, however, that the force of the mischief
   was to be restrained to the time prescribed for the relaxation. The
   interval of time certainly agrees exactly; for Elmachinus, the Arabian
   historian whom I have so often quoted,--than whom, no one marks the
   successive periods of time more accurately,--relates that Togrulbec
   Saglucides, the prince of the Turks, (who is called by our writers
   Tangrolipix, of the Zelzucian family,) having taken the rout of Bagdad,
   was invested by the caliph Cajim Biamrilla with the imperial garment,
   and was inaugurated into the kingdom in the year of the Hegira 449,
   that is, of Christ 1057. "Then," says he, "was the empire confirmed to
   him."

   From this time, then, the stronghold of the Saracenic empire being
   given to them with the whole Trans-Euphratean dominion, the Turks were
   prepared, that after a prophetic day, and a month, and a year, they
   should kill a third part of men; that is, in the year of Christ 1453,
   they should utterly destroy the remnant of the Roman empire in the
   East, by the capture of the royal city of Constantinople. For the
   interval from 1057 to the year 1453, when Constantinople was taken, is
   precisely 396 years, of which a day forms one, a month thirty, and a
   year three hundred and sixty-five. Such is here the accuracy of the
   calculation, that any one may easily be led to suspect the hour
   likewise, (which, according to the mode of reckoning the other parts of
   time, would produce fifteen days, would equally correspond with the
   event, if the month of the inauguration of Togrulbey was handed down to
   us as well as the year. In the mean time, till that be established, the
   hour may here be taken for a seasonable time, and the conjunction kai
   may be explained exegetically, as if they were prepared against a
   seasonable time, namely, for a day, a month, and a year, that they
   might kill a third part of men.

   How many years should thence run on to the destruction of the Turkish
   dominion, is no where explained; only it is said that it should be
   about the end of the times of the beast; that is, that the second woe
   should then be on the point of concluding, when the third woe should
   threaten the abolition of the kingdom of the beast, c. xi. v. 14, 15.

   But, before I quit this subject, I will, not unwillingly, confess, that
   if the exact correspondence of the prophecy with the event did not, as
   it were, force conviction upon me, another interpretation of the
   following kind would have been by no means unpleasing,--that those
   angels were prepared and appointed for every occasion, whether it were
   for an hour, or a day, or a month, or even for a year, for performing
   the work of which there was need. But whether it is likely that so
   accurate an answer as to time, as the event here exhibits, could have
   happened by chance, let others judge. It will be for him to form an
   opinion with whom there is a doubt.

   The next point is of the quality and number of the forces. "And the
   number, (says he,) of the army of horsemen was two myriads of myriads,"
   i. e. two hundred thousand, or two hundred million. He names the
   horsemen, and not any other kind of force, in the whole description of
   the plague, as if this enemy from the Euphrates was wholly composed of
   cavalry. Is it because, in the Turkish army, the cavalry so far exceeds
   the infantry, that the latter, in comparison with the former, is of no
   consequence? Yes, (and that, I believe, was principally regarded by the
   Holy Spirit,) because this is the character of the nation Magog, long
   ago, consecrated by Ezekiel, from which the Turks were descended. For
   thus, in that most celebrated prophecy of Gog, which was a common name
   of the kings of Magog [32] , as Pharaoh of the Egyptians, he describes
   that nation from its equestrian army, c. xxxviii. v. 4. "And I will
   bring thee forth and all thy army, horse and horsemen, all clothed with
   breast-plates." Again, v. 15. "And thou shalt come from thy place, from
   the sides of the North, thou, and many people with thee, all riding on
   horses," &c. Moreover, Gog himself is called the chief Prince of
   Mesech, and Tubal; that is, he, who, coming forth from his bounds,
   ruled in both the Armenias, on this, and on the farther side of the
   Euphrates. Here, in the name of the hither Armenia, I comprehend the
   Cappadocians, anciently denominated Meschini, or Moschi, where both the
   chief town Mazacha, afterwards called Cesarea, and the Moschic
   mountains in the same tract, are no obscure marks of the inhabitants
   being sprung from Mesech.

   The farther, or greater Armenia, is what is called at this day
   Turcomania, from the inhabitation of the Turks; in which was formerly
   the city Thelbalana, the Tibaunian and Balbitenian people, the river
   Teleboas, and other vestiges of the name of Tubal. The war, however,
   which Ezekiel relates, is not to be understood of that undertaken in
   this irruption of the Turks, which John describes, (this he seems only
   to allude to,) but of another, the last after the return of the Jews;
   and, if it be lawful to conjecture, when the power which now occupies
   the country shall have first in some degree receded from it.

   But on the type of cavalry, there is something else I would add with
   the leave of the reader, provided no one will. think me too much given
   to the play of names and etymologies. Even solid and well-cooked food
   is apt to be more palatable with sauce. Let not the reader, then, be
   disgusted, if I subjoin something of this kind. The Turks, in truth,
   before they were set loose, had become, by long inhabitation, Persians,
   and were every where called by that name in the Byzantine historians.
   Nicetas, certainly, who embraces in his history the greatest part of
   the time when they were restrained to the Euphrates, almost always
   calls them Persians,--very rarely, Turks. But the Persians, you will
   observe, are horsemen, even from the very sound, since phrs Paras, by
   which name Persia is called in the sacred books, (and Parthia is the
   same, only with another pronunciation,) signifies in the three Oriental
   languages, the Hebrew, the Chaldee, and the Arabian, a horse or
   horseman. For this reason, then, the Turco Persians are called the
   Euphratean horsemen, that is, the inhabitants on the Euphrates, are
   called by the national name of horsemen. Nor does there appear to be
   wanting (if any one should object to the irrelevancy of this) an
   example in Daniel, c. viii., where the Macedonians, who at that time
   were called Egeades, (that is, goats,) are designated under the type of
   goats, and their king under the figure of a he-goat. "Behold," says he,
   "a male of the goats, came from the west," &c. He means Alexander the
   Great, the king of the Egeades. They are the Macedonians. For so that
   nation was called, when the first seat of the kingdom was established,
   from Caranus the founder, two hundred years, more or less, before the
   time of Daniel. Justin the epitomizer, of Thogus, relates the cause of
   the name, whose words I shall not think it troublesome to subjoin.
   "Caranus," says he, "with a great multitude of the Greeks, being
   commanded by the answer of the oracle to seek for habitations in
   Macedonia, when he came into Æmathia, occupied the city Edessa, having
   followed a herd of goats, flying from the rain, the inhabitants not
   being aware of it, in consequence of the heavy cloud and rain, and
   recalling the oracle to mind, by which he had been ordered to seek for
   empire under the guidance of goats, he made it the seat of his kingdom,
   and afterwards made it a religious observance, wherever his troops
   moved, to have the same goats before his standards, esteeming them who
   had been the authors and founders of his kingdom, as the leaders of his
   undertakings. He called the city Edessa, in memory of the benefit
   received, Ægeas, and the people Ægeades." Vide cetera.

   There is such an agreement here, that one might be tempted to suspect
   the type of a ram in the same vision, applied to the king of the
   Persians, alludes to the signification of the name Elam, one of the two
   by which that nation is called. For 'yl in the Hebrew, (whence the name
   'yl Aries, ram,) and 'lm and lm in the Chaldee, signify the same;
   namely, strong or robust. Perhaps, therefore, ylm Elam had the same
   sound as 'yl ram to these, and thence the king of Elam is described
   under this type by Daniel. However it be, when the thing itself is
   otherwise confirmed, this agreement of names with the type cannot help
   being matter of pious delight to those who are studious of these
   matters, whether it be believed to have happened from accident or
   otherwise. And this by the way.

   Now I return again to the Euphratean horse, "whose number," says he,
   "was two myriads of myriads." Others read myriads of myriads, expunging
   the two, as c. v. v. 11. It signifies an immense multitude, as Psalm
   lxviii. "The chariots of God are two myriads,'"--twenty thousand. For a
   myriad rvv' or rvvh is one of those words of number, which in Hebrew
   are words to be indefinitely taken, as among the Latins six hundred,
   and does not denote the number ten thousand, but some great number,
   especially when thus doubled, as may be seen in Daniel, c. vii. v. 10.
   But how great and how immense the forces of the Turks were in their
   expeditions, and usually are at this day, must be unknown to no one.

   "And I heard," he adds, "their number." Since it might be asked whence
   John was acquainted with the number, as what was not possible to be
   represented to him in a vision, he says, "I heard." The like is to be
   understood likewise in other visions, as often as any thing is related
   which could not be exhibited to sight; namely, that the apostle was
   informed by a voice.

   The next subject is the armour. "And thus I saw the horses in
   appearance, and those who sat on them, having breast-plates of fire,
   and hyacinth, and sulphur, and the heads of the horses were as the
   heads of lions, and out of their mouths proceeded fire, and smoke, and
   sulphur. By these three were killed the third part of men."

   No where in any part of the prophets, or elsewhere in the sacred
   writings, occurs an image of this kind, "of fire and hyacinthine smoke
   and sulphur." Where I understand it literally of that new (and previous
   to this trumpet) unheard of arms, which those Euphratean enemies made
   use of, immediately after they had been set loose. I understand it of
   cannon, vomiting fire, smoke, and sulphur. For gunpowder is ignivomous,
   with hyacinthine smoke, and sulphureous matter, which those who use in
   war, obtrude themselves on the senses of their enemies, as covered with
   breast-plates of fire, hyacinth, and sulphur, from a medium involved in
   fire, smoke, and the smell of sulphur; on which account the horses'
   heads are seen to be of a fierce and terrible appearance, like those of
   lions. Hence John says, that he saw the horses and horsemen, not
   really, but in appearance, such as he describes. In appearance, I say,
   en horasei not in reality, having breast-plates of fire, hyacinth, and
   sulphur; in appearance, having heads like lions; lastly, in appearance,
   not in reality, out of the mouths of the horses proceed fire, and
   smoke, and sulphur; since it is wont to appear so to those who behold
   it on the opposite side. This is the force of the expression en
   horasei, in semblance, which is used twice in this sense in the fourth
   chapter, v. 3, "He was in appearance like a jasper stone"--and "a
   rainbow in appearance, like an emerald." No where else, except once
   only, does that word appear in the New Testament. By this triple plague
   of fire-arms, namely, "of fire, smoke, and sulphur," he adds, "were the
   third part of men killed;" that is, those who were of that trient, or
   third part, which we called the Roman world. For it is not necessary
   here, or elsewhere, where a third is mentioned, to understand the whole
   of that third, but to take it partitively. Examples of which kind of
   ellipse of the partitive words occur elsewhere in the Scriptures, as
   well as in this book; as Jud. c. xii. v. 7, "Jephthah was buried in the
   cities of Gilead;" that is, in one of the cities. And Apo. c. xviii. v.
   16, "The ten horns hate the harlot;" that is, some of them. So, to
   triton, "the third part of men were killed," implies those of that
   third part.

   Who does not know that this was abundantly fulfilled in the destruction
   of Constantinople? Was not that most illustrious city, the chief of the
   third part of men, besieged with those fire-breathing machines, and
   given up to slaughter? Listen to Chalcocondylas! "Mechmet," says he,
   "in the expedition against Byzantium, ordered the largest cannon to be
   made, of a size which at that time we had never known to have existed.
   He dispersed them every where through the camp, that they might throw
   their balls against the Greeks. One of which was of such magnitude,
   that it was drawn by seventy yoke of oxen and two thousand men. To
   this, two others of the largest size were attached, on either side,
   each of which sent forth a stone, whose weight was equal to half a
   talent. After these, came that wonderful mortar which threw a ball
   whose weight amounted to three talents, and threw down great part of
   the wall. Whose thundering explosion is reported to have been so great
   that the neighbouring region was shaken to the distance of forty
   stadia; that is, five miles. This piece of artillery sometimes sent
   forth seven balls; one by night, which was a signal for the coming day,
   and indicated to what point in that day the balls would be directed."
   He who desires to know more, and how, even in the maritime siege,
   cannon were made use of, and how the walls, after being for forty days
   stoutly battered by cannon, fell at length; and how Longus, duke of
   Genoa, with his people, assailed by cannon balls, deserted the place,
   and opened a way into the city for the Turks, let him resort to
   Chalcocondylas himself. From the same author, moreover, he will learn
   that the Peloponnesian Isthmus, having been attacked by Amurath, the
   father of Mechmet, with the same arms, and the inhabitants compelled to
   obey his commands, were entirely subjugated by Mechmet himself, Corinth
   having been attacked likewise with a force of fire-arms, immediately
   after the capture of Constantinople.

   To this account of their arms, is added something about the nature of
   the horses and their riders. That "their power was not in their mouths"
   only, (of which we have hitherto treated,) but "in their tails; for
   they have tails like serpents, having heads with which they hurt." That
   is, the same as was said above, concerning the Saracens, holds true
   likewise of the Turks; that they effected mischief, not only by hostile
   force, but likewise by the train of the Mohammedan imposture, wherever
   they proceeded. These, therefore, not less than the Saracenic locusts,
   (whose religion they adopted,) are serpents in their tail. That one
   kind of serpentine tail may be attributed to the latter, and another to
   the former, arises from the natural shape of each, and the difference
   between locusts and horses, by which the pointed tail of scorpions is
   most suitable to the former, and tails with serpents' heads best
   adapted to the latter. But "the rest of the men who were not killed by
   these plagues, yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they
   should not worship demons, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass,
   and stone, and wood, which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk," &c.

   Now who these are, it will not be difficult to collect; since in the
   whole Roman world, or on this side the Euphrates, there are none which
   worship images, with shame and sorrow be it spoken! besides Christians.
   Does it not necessarily follow, then, that it is they who worship
   demons also? since the worship of both is ascribed to the same persons
   in this place. But what in fine you will say, are demons? Not, in
   truth, what they themselves hold to be impure spirits, and often call
   them so, (for what Christian would knowingly and willingly worship
   them?) but what were understood under this name by the theologists of
   the Gentiles--deities, consecrated under the names either of angels or
   dead men. "Every demon," says Plato, "is a being between God and
   mortals." Again, "God holds not communication with man, but through a
   demon in every conference:" In Symposis, intercourse carried on between
   the gods and men. The other Platonic philosophers, and most of the
   various sects, except the Epicureans, held the same. I will quote the
   words of Apulcius only, in which the opinion of Plato, and the rest, is
   fully and perspicuously contained: "Demons," says he, "are middle
   powers, through whom both our desires and merits pass to the gods. They
   are carriers between mortals and the heavenly inhabitants, from hence
   of prayers, from thence of gifts; who bear to and fro from hence
   petitions, and from thence supplies; or, indeed, they are interpreters
   and ushers on either side. For it would not," says he, "be suitable to
   the majesty of the celestial gods, to attend to these things."

   They had, in truth, two sorts of gods; the celestial, who, perpetually
   residing in heaven, and the stars, did not humble themselves to these
   earthly things, and were not to be defiled with their contagion. (These
   were properly and especially called gods.) The others were demons, who,
   as mediating powers, and ministers of the celestial or highest gods,
   had the management of human affairs. The former, (if I rightly
   conceive,) the Holy Scripture calls the host of heaven; the latter,
   (especially those who were made of dead men,) it calls Baalim, from
   Baal, a king of the Babylonians or Assyrians; or in the Chaldaic
   pronunciation, Bel, who was the first who was consecrated a demon after
   death by his people; from whence it came to pass afterwards, that
   powers of this kind were called Baalim or Baals, as Baal Peor,
   Baalberith, Baalzebub, Baal Moloch, Jer. c. xix., as from the first
   emperor Julius Cæsar, the rest of the Roman emperors were called
   Cæsars. Now how this theology of demons agrees with the worship of
   saints and angels among false Christians, the fact itself declares;
   only with this difference, that they had many supreme or celestial
   gods: we have only one, the Father of all. But we ought likewise to
   have only one Mediator, our Lord Jesus Christ, if false prophets had
   not introduced more in the nature of demons. Plainly, according to what
   St. Paul prophesied, 1 Tim. c. iv. vv. 1, 2, 3, "that it should come to
   pass, in the latter times through the hypocrisy of liars," inventing
   lying miracles, and through the feigned sanctity of monks abstaining by
   a vow from marriage and meats, that "the doctrine of demons," that is,
   the theology of heathen deities, should be brought back again into the
   world. The interpretation will agree with the words, if we take the
   genitive demons passively, that is, a doctrine concerning demons, as
   Heb. c. vi. v. 22, Didache bartismon, didache epitheseos cheiron, &c.
   The doctrine of baptisms, of laying on of hands, &c. For, in truth, the
   expression, "through the hypocrisy of liars," and the words that
   follow, in order that the construction of the syntax may be preserved,
   is to be explained by the government of the two substantives, the
   preposition en through, denoting the instrument and cause (which is
   familiar in the Hebrew.) But I have treated more diffusively of this
   passage in a particular tract, and I have no intention to repeat it
   here.

  THE PROCLAMATION

   Of the Third Woe Trumpet, or Trumpet the Seventh.

   The vision of the sixth trumpet being finished, (for there is only one
   vision under one trumpet, as under the seals and phials,) the next
   place in order was due to the sounding of the seventh. This, however,
   is deferred, and the Holy Spirit, in the prophecy of the little book,
   to which he is now about to pass, in order that nothing might be
   wanting to the completion of the prophecy of the seals, now just
   finishing, supplies the place of that trumpet's sound which is
   deferred, by an oath, under which the effect of that trumpet is
   generally indicated. That it should surely come to pass, when that
   angel shall have sounded, that the Roman beast, in the latest times of
   the last head, having been accused, "the mystery of God should be
   finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets." For so it
   was predicted long ago to Daniel, that the fourth beast being slain,
   the, King of the Saints should come to rule over the whole world, (c.
   vii.) and at the same time, the glorious promise of the restitution of
   Israel should be completed, (c. xii.) For that this is the kingdom
   which he calls the fulfilment of the mystery of God, the acclamation
   subjoined to the sound of that trumpet will not suffer us to doubt.
   "The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of
   his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever." So that it is
   wonderful that any persons should be found who understand it in a
   different sense. The time, of which the angel here swears, that nothing
   should extend beyond it, can be no other than either the time of the
   fourth monarchy universally, (or to come more closely to the point,
   though it is the same thing,) of the last kingdom, that is, the Roman;
   the last period "of time, and times, and half a time." Since the same
   which is said by John to come to pass "when time shall be no more; is
   pointed out by Daniel to come. to pass when the period of the last
   times shall be finished.

   And this consummation of the mystery of God, is the subject matter of
   the seventh trumpet; to which seven thunders are added as
   accompaniments, for they are not the very subject which the trumpet
   exhibits as contemporary with it.

   While the angel is making his proclamation about the mystery of the
   trumpet, seven thunders utter their voices. "He cried," says he, "with
   a loud voice, as when a lion roareth, and when he cried, seven thunders
   uttered their voices." That is, when he had begun his proclamation,
   seven thunders began to speak. And they cannot but contemporize with
   the seventh trumpet, since what follows the sixth trumpet necessarily
   falls within the seventh [33] . But what is the voice of thunder? Is it
   not Bath Kol? If so, the seven thunders will be as many oracles by
   which the period of the seventh trumpet will be distinguished as by
   certain dates, but on a subject wholly unknown, and not to be
   understood until its own times. And this the prohibition given from
   heaven to St. John, when he was about to write down the words of the
   seven thunders, seems to intimate: "Seal up those things which the
   seven thunders have spoken, and write them not." In vain, therefore,
   will it be for us to inquire, what God wished to have concealed and
   reserved to its own times. And in this manner sufficient use is made of
   the seventh trumpet in its place and order, though the explanation of
   its sound, by which the whole mystery would be fully disclosed, is
   referred to another time; on the design of which reference, and the
   whole art of the contrivance, it will not be superfluous or
   unprofitable to dwell afresh and a little more diffusively, though
   notice was taken of it in the Apocalyptical Key, since the reason of it
   escapes most of the interpreters. The diligent contemplation of the
   system of the Apocalyptical visions, constructed on the characters of
   the synchronisms, first enlightened me on this subject, and will also,
   O Reader, if I am not deceived, enlighten you.

   The fact then is, (for I would unfold it with as much perspicuity and
   brevity of expression as possible,) both prophecies, as well that of
   the seals, as of the Biblaridion, are concluded by the same issue of
   events, by that in truth, which the seventh trumpet exhibits. To
   indicate which, the Holy Spirit having slightly, but as much as was
   necessary, there presignified the mystery of the seventh trumpet in its
   own place, in the series of trumpets, deferred the fuller explanation
   of its sound, until he had made a transition to the new prophecy of the
   little book, (ch. x. from v. 8 to the end.) and carried forward the
   first vision of it, having completed in like manner its Apocalyptical
   course to the same issue of things, (c. xi. v. 14.) and then that
   mystery of the seventh trumpet, the common catastrophe of both
   prophecies, and the former (that of the seals) only promulgated in a
   general manner, is here at length, on the uttering of the sound, fully
   unfolded; and that, indeed, in a most commodious manner, since
   otherwise, and without the previous knowledge of both prophecies, what
   depended upon each could not have been understood. And hence it is,
   that the business of this transition was not brought about by any angel
   of the trumpets, but by that great and illustrious angel who held in
   his hand the Biblaridion, the symbol of the second prophecy, which was
   soon to be devoured by St. John.

   It belonged to him who revealed the second prophecy, that the
   manifestation of the trumpets' sound, which contained the catastrophe
   of both prophecies, should be so far defined. Nay, if that angel, as
   may seem capable of being collected from his more august clothing and
   whole apparatus, was Christ the Lord [34] ; to no one more properly
   belonged this right of suspending the last sound for the sake of
   another prophecy, than to Him who was the author of both.--Hitherto,
   indeed, he had appeared in the form of a lamb, but now he seems to have
   taken to him the person of an angel [35] , since he was about to reveal
   to John the same mystery of consummation, which he had formerly
   revealed to Daniel under the same appearance of an angel [36] , and
   with the same formality and words of an oath. You may compare Dan. c.
   xii. v. 6, 7, with ver. 5 of the xth chapter.

THE INTERPRETATION

   Of the Little Book, or, of the other System of Apocalyptical Visions,
   according to the Rule of the Apocalyptical Key.

   The course of the seals being finished, in which the affairs of the
   empire were described, we come now to the other prophecy, much more
   noble in its kind, as containing the Fates of the Church, or of
   Religion. John is introduced to it by the delivery and eating up of the
   open book, being endued as it were with a degree of the prophetic
   faculty. "And the voice (says he) which I had heard from heaven, spake
   again unto me saying," (viz. that voice, as of a trumpet, talking with
   him, ch. iv.) "and said, Go, take the little book which is open in the
   hand of the angel, standing upon the sea, and upon the earth; and I
   went to the angel, saying unto him, Give me the little book. And he
   said unto me, Take and eat it up," &c. Moreover, as the prophecy now to
   be revealed, as the knowledge of Divine things and secrets, especially
   those to come, usually is, was to be sweet and pleasant in its
   foretaste; but, on account of the calamitous state of the Church, or
   perhaps, of the obscurity of those allegories and types with which it
   was covered, it would, like aloes taken into the stomach, greatly wound
   the mind of him who should unfold and penetrate into its sense.
   Therefore it is said, that the book to be eaten by the apostle would
   indeed be sweet in the mouth,--that is, in first appearance and first
   flavour, delightful to the mind,--but when received into the stomach
   and digested, would bring on bitterness. "And it shall," says he,
   "render thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey."
   The whole image is taken from Ezekiel, except that, though there is
   mention of sweetness in the mouth, yet there is no reference, or but an
   obscure one, to bitterness in the belly.

   The book, being thus taken and swallowed, the meaning of the symbol is
   explained in the clearest and most express words; namely, that on St.
   John was imposed the gift of another and still more noble prophecy,
   which should retrace the path of the former, to be received from
   Christ, and to be brought to the knowledge of the Church. "And I took,"
   says he, "the little book from the hands of the angel, and ate it up,
   and it was in my mouth sweet as honey, but when I had eaten it, my
   stomach was embittered."--"And he said unto me;" (this is the meaning
   of the symbol,) "Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and
   nations, and tongues, and kings [37] ."

   Such was the inauguration of St. John. Then follows the prophecy, which
   begins with an act of his, relative to the temple of God. And
   therefore, by the image of a double court, one measured, and the other
   rejected on account of the profanation of the Gentiles, demonstrates
   that there would be in order a double state of the Church.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE MEANING

   Of the Interior Court measured by the Reed of God.

   The inner court of the temple, with those who worship therein, to be
   measured by the Divine reed, denotes the primeval state of the Church,
   examined, and accurately proved to be holy, according to the rule of
   the Divine word.--Not yet in truth, as it was afterwards, (when we
   arrive at the times of the outer court,) varying from measure, without
   symmetry, from the contagion of idolatrous worship, but serving God for
   some ages, regularly, through one only Mediator, Jesus Christ.

   For it appears to me that a measure of this kind was intended, even
   under the type of the angelical dimension in Ezekiel; because it is
   said to him, c. xliii. from v. 7 to 10, and in the following verses,
   "But thou, O son of man, show the temple to the house of Israel, that
   they may be ashamed for their iniquities, and let them measure the
   pattern." See the passage. But if any one should think differently, and
   had rather refer the type of dimension to the signification of
   building, as what is displayed in architectural engravings, or
   graphically, may be the measurement by God, according to the prophets,
   that will still correspond to the same sense. For what then will this
   court denote, measured by the Divine reed, but the state of the Church
   so represented to be the workmanship of God, built on the foundation of
   the apostles and prophets, Christ himself being the chief corner-stone?
   opposed to the following court, which God did not acknowledge for his
   building, and therefore John is prohibited from measuring. Whether you
   interpret it in the latter or the former manner, the substance, as you
   see, will be the same. But he that shall interpret it in a different
   sense, unless I am mistaken, can bring no example of his interpretation
   from Scripture.

   How appositely indeed the situation of the altar in this court may
   adumbrate the frequent sacrifices of martyrs, under that state of the
   Church, will appear, both from the circumstance itself, and from the
   contemporary vision of the red dragon fighting with Michael for the
   offspring of the woman, when we come to the interpretation thereof.

  THE MEANING

   Of the Outer Court with the Holy City trodden under foot by the
   Gentiles, and on that account to be omitted and rejected from
   measurement.

   The outer court trodden under foot by the nations, and rejected from
   the divine measurement, designates the holy city of God, or the
   Christian Church, soon after the end of the times of the regular court,
   (to which it immediately succeeds) to be given up to new idolatries,
   and its affairs having been confirmed by the entire demolition of the
   Gentile worship under the first court, it was now to be profaned by the
   contagion of renewed idolatry, as of revived ethnicism; in one word,
   the anti-christian apostasy which was to flourish in the Church for
   forty-two months of years [38] . Concerning which, in the history of
   the Beast, in a vision of a like nature contemporizing with this court,
   we shall fully and particularly treat.

   But let us consider the words of the text in the interpretation of
   which we are now engaged. "And there was given me, says he, a reed like
   a rod; and the angel stood, saying, Arise, and measure the temple of
   God, and the altar, and those that worship therein. But the court,
   which is without the temple, leave out, and do not measure it, for it
   is given up to the Gentiles, and the holy city shall they tread under
   foot forty-two months."

   In order that we may rightly understand the meaning of these words, it
   is to be understood that TO HiERON (by which name I embrace the whole
   edifice of the temple,) was distinguished by a double court, the one
   interior, in which the Nah, or temple itself, together with the altar
   of burnt-offering before its doors was situated, and was open to the
   Priests and Levites only; the other exterior, which is called (2 Chron.
   c. iv. v. 9.) the great court, and by Ezekiel, more than twelve times,
   the court without, or the outer court. This was the court of the
   Israelites, or of the Israelitish people, and therefore not improperly
   called the court of Israel, though that part belonging to the men, was
   more especially called so by the Jews. The first court was known by the
   names of the temple and the altar of sacrifice. "Rise, said he, and
   measure the temple of God (Naon) and the altar of sacrifice." Where the
   thusiasterion does not mean the altar of burnt-offerings only which was
   there situated, but the space which surrounded it, that is, the whole
   space of the altar and sacrifice; as is to be collected from the words
   immediately connected with it, "and those who worship therein;" that
   is, in the place of sacrifice. How, likewise, Thusiasterion is taken c.
   xiv. v. 18, and c. xvi. v. 7, vide Beza. Whence the old lexicon in
   Greek and Latin interprets Thusiasterion altarium, sacrarium, altar,
   sacred place, and vice versâ, the glossary of Philoxenus, sacrarium
   Heroon Thusiasterion. Temple of a hero, place of the altar. But this
   Thusiasterion, together with the area of the temple (i. e. tou Naou) I
   learn to be rightly comprehended within the name of the interior court,
   from the description of the tabernacle, where, in like manner, the
   whole enclosure which surrounded the dwelling-place, and altar of
   burnt-offering is reckoned under the denomination of one court, as
   appears Ex. c. xl. v. 33. So much of the first court which John is
   ordered to measure; but the latter court is designated clearly enough
   by its name--"The court which is without the temple, that is, by an
   ellipsis of the former substantive,--the court which is exterior to the
   enclosure of the temple and altar, and since the Gentiles admitted
   without right and justice were stabled in this, it is ordered by no
   means to be measured, but to be cast forth, and considered as profane.
   But you will say, it is not the outer court, but the holy city which is
   to be trodden down by the Gentiles. I answer, that the outer court and
   the holy city mutually explain each other, since the outer court was
   the place for the holy city or people of Israel to meet in for divine
   purposes: Nay, in the wilderness, the tabernacle having only one court,
   (which it was not lawful to enter ordinarily, unless for the Priests
   and Levites), there was no outer court, beside the camp of Israel, or
   the holy city. Therefore the sense is the same as if it were said, "The
   court which is without the temple cast out, and do not measure it, for
   it is given up to the Gentiles, and they shall tread it under forty-two
   months. For the relative it, a substantive is substituted, and that of
   the same kind, so as to point out the subject intended by the
   antecedent. "The holy city, says he, shall they tread under forty-two
   months." The change of the substantive for the relative often occurs
   both in this book and elsewhere, namely, when either the substantive
   which precedes, is repeated in the place of the relative, or its
   synonyme is substituted instead of the relative. An example of the
   latter kind you have here, and Acts c. xxv. v. 21. And indeed what else
   shall we say could be given to the Gentiles to have the power of
   occupying, so as to trample under foot? And what could the Gentiles
   trample on, but that which was given them? so that these words, not
   less than the court and holy city, seem mutually to explain one
   another.

  THE MYSTERY

   Of the Two Witnesses prophesying in Sackcloth.

   Two witnesses or prophets sent by God, clothed in sackcloth, are to
   preach, while the Gentiles are treading under foot the court of the
   people of God, or the holy city. These are the interpreters and
   assertors of Divine truth, who should deplore that foul and lamentable
   contamination of the Church of Christ, by continual complaints, and
   whom God would raise up as unceasing monitors to the Christian world,
   committing whoredom with the Gentiles, and as guides to his saints
   preserving the faith. After the example of those illustrious pairs,
   under the Old Testament, Moses and Aaron in the Wilderness, Elijah and
   Elisha under the Baalitical apostasy, Zorobabel and Jeshua under the
   Babylonian captivity. From their number, condition, power and actions,
   these Apocalyptical witnesses seem to be manifestly described, as
   likewise the state of the church in which they prophesied, agreeably
   with that of Israel, under the images of Babylon, the Wilderness and
   Gentilism, or Baalism. Let the reader examine with his own eyes what I
   have said of the description of the witnesses in the following table:

   Moses and Aaron. Elias and Elisha. Zorobabe1 & Jeshua.

   "Having power over the waters, to turn them into blood. and to smite
   the earth with every plague."

   "Having power to shut heaven, that it should not rain."

   "These are the two olive-trees, and two candlesticks, which stand
   before the Lord of the earth."

   "Whoever would hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and
   devoureth their adversaries."
   Numbers xvi. 2 Kings i. Zech. iv.

   Now let us come to the text. "And I will give power, (says he,) to my
   two witnesses, and they shall prophesy 1260 days, clothed in
   sackcloth." Where it is first to be remarked, that the whole prophecy
   which follows, from this comma to the sounding of the seventh trumpet,
   as the nature of the subject demands, was not exhibited to sight in a
   vision, but dictated to John by the angel sustaining the person of
   Christ, the observation of which renders the genius of the allegory or
   type much more easy to be perceived. "To my two witnesses." He calls
   them two with reference to the type, which is, as I have observed, of
   pairs; as if he had said I will give to my Zorobabel, and Jeshua, to my
   Elijah and Elisha, to my Moses and Aaron:--To which is to be added,
   that he calls them witnesses: Now witnesses by the law ought to be two,
   to establish every word. Add that they may be called two on account of
   the number of the tables of God, which the witnesses of the Old and New
   Testament, as of two Testaments, might apply in their prophecy [39] .

   "That they should prophesy clothed in sackcloth," that is, by woefully
   lamenting the trampling down of the Holy City, in consequence of the
   introduction of Gentile worship, by affording testimony to the truth of
   God, and by exhorting to repentance, "For 1260 days"--which indeed Are
   contained in forty-two months, and these it is plain are not days of
   hours; both from those three days and a half, part of those days a
   little after, assigned to the death of the witnesses, and which the
   things predicted to be done in them, prove, cannot be taken for days of
   hours; and because the beast (whose duration is the same), is
   contemporary with the company of 144,000 sealed: the company of the
   sealed is contemporary with the six first trumpets, and the affairs of
   the trumpets cannot possibly be run through in so very short a time as
   1260 horary days, or three years and a half. But why, you will say,
   should the profanation of the Gentiles be measured by months, and the
   prophecy of the witnesses asserting the pure worship of God in days?
   Namely, because the worship of idols and every sin and error is under
   the power of darkness and night, over which the moon presides; on the
   other hand, true religion may be compared to the light and the day, the
   presidency over which belongs to the sun. Therefore (Acts c. xxvi. v.
   18.) the mission of Paul to convert the Gentiles from idols, is said to
   be, "to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan
   unto God." With the same meaning also it is said "what fellowship has
   light with darkness?" Now months are directed by the motion of the moon
   the queen of darkness, but days and years by that of the sun who
   presides over light. For the same cause, as we shall see hereafter, the
   blasphemy of the beast will be reckoned in like manner according to the
   motion of the moon, by months, but the residence of the woman in the
   wilderness by days and years with reference to the motion of the sun.
   "These are the two olive-trees and the two candlesticks, standing
   before the Lord of the earth." That is, they are like Zorobabel and
   Jeshua [40] whom the Lord anciently anointed over the Jewish church,
   ruined under the Babylonian captivity, at length to be restored and
   superintended by these witnesses in a similar manner, under the bondage
   of the Gentiles. For the allusion is to "those two olive-trees," which
   Zacharias saw growing on each side of the golden candlestick, and
   supplying oil to its lamps, (Zach. c. iv.) of which the angel being
   asked what they meant, "these, said he, are the two sons of oil, or the
   anointed ones, which stand before the Lord of the whole earth, pointing
   out the two heads of the church, then in subjection to the
   Gentiles.--Zorobabel, the general, and Jeshua, the high priest, of whom
   he had prophesied a little before. For the candle then with its seven
   lights, designated the temple, and by its type the church of that time,
   whose instauration and conservation, the two holy ones were to take
   charge of, not by force, not by strength, not by any human aid, but by
   the power of God alone, operating in a certain invisible and wonderful
   manner, as those olive-trees, standing on each side of the candlestick,
   supplied oil to its lights in a very extraordinary and imperceptible
   way. But why, you will say, is mention here made by John, not of one as
   in Zacharias, but of two candlesticks, to which likewise and not to the
   anointed ones, the two prophets seem to be compared? I confess that I
   am here at a stand, nor have I yet found a sufficiently prompt and
   clear reason for this difference. In the mean time I think there lurks
   a Hebraism in the words, and it is as if he had said:--These are the
   two olive-trees, at or near the two candlesticks, standing before the
   Lord of the earth; so that the comparison of the witnesses may be only
   with the olive-trees, but the addition of the candlesticks may be
   judged only to pertain to the description of those olive-trees. For the
   copulative in the Hebrew has sometimes the force of the preposition m,
   that is, with, near by; as (1 Sam. c. xiv. v. 18.) "Because the ark of
   God was at that time, and the children of Israel;" e. with the children
   of Israel. Vide Lex. Schindleri. But there will still remain a
   difficulty about the two candlesticks. May it be said, that the one
   only in Zacharias may here be reckoned for a double candlestick on
   account of the double rank of lights on each side of the stem; and the
   two olive-trees pouring in oil secretly on each side? There is,
   likewise, in Zacharias the mention of seven and seven and twice seven
   infusers, but what the meaning is does not sufficiently appear. But may
   we not suppose that this duplicate alludes to the private designation
   of the Christian church? as being compounded of two people, of Jews and
   Gentiles; or what, perhaps, is nearer the truth, because, at the time,
   in which the witnesses clothed in sack-cloth, were uttering their
   lamentation, it was to be divided together with the Roman empire into
   that of the east and west.

   However it may be, it is certain that the candlesticks signify not the
   prophets or presidents of the churches, but the churches themselves,
   because in chapter i. the angel interprets the seven candlesticks, as
   so many Churches. "The seven candlesticks, (says he,) which thou
   sawest, are the seven Churches. [41] "

   "If any one wish to hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and
   devoureth their enemies, and if any one wish to hurt them, so must he
   be killed." The witnesses do not revenge themselves by the sword or
   daggers, if they are ever injured by their enemies, but out of their
   mouth proceedeth the vengeance; that is, they transfix their enemies
   with the shafts of the Word; whilst they are denouncing the wrath of
   God impending over the violators of his ministers, or imploring
   vengeance with their prayers and groans. For the fire which is here
   reported as proceeding out of the mouth of the witnesses is the word of
   vengeance; agreeably to that saying of the Lord to Jeremiah (v. 15.).
   "Behold I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood,
   and it shall devour them." Moses, indeed, and Aaron, and afterwards
   Elijah, the former against the conspirators in the sedition of Korah,
   the latter against the ministers of Ahaziah the King, the worshipper of
   Baal, literally called down fire from heaven, but the fire of our
   witnesses is to be interpreted mystically, since by the instruction of
   the holy spirit, our Egypt, and consequently the wilderness, is to be
   understood spiritually. Moreover, what the prophets denounce in the
   name of God, they are said to execute, as what the Lord says to the
   same Jeremiah, (c. i. v. 10.) "I have set thee over the nations and
   kingdoms, to root out and to pull down, and to destroy, to build, and
   to plant." Let not any one now be surprised that fire or the divine
   vengeance is said to be poured out of the mouth of the witnesses, with
   whom however the only power is that of denouncing or imploring it from
   God. It is thus the witnesses revenge their own injuries. That which
   follows shows by what means also they revenge the reproach brought upon
   the temple of God.

   "These have power to shut heaven that it rain not;" (viz. that mystical
   rain fall not) "in the days of their prophecy. That is, they are endued
   with the power of the keys, by which they can shut heaven on those new
   Gentiles, contaminators of the Christian worship, that the grace of
   Christ's blood, sealed to them by baptism may not distil upon them for
   the remission of sins, so long as they shall persevere in being the
   cause of the mournful prophecy of the witnesses by their idolatries and
   superstitions. I will speak more plainly. They expel by the word of God
   those new idolaters from the hope of eternal life promised to the pure
   worshippers of God alone; until, mindful of the stipulation in their
   baptism, and having rejected the services of Satan, they shall have
   returned to the worship of the one God, through the only Mediator Jesus
   Christ, and thus put an end to the mournful prophecy of the witnesses.
   In the same manner also, Elijah did not bring rain again upon the
   Israelites, when they were already almost half dead with drought, until
   the worship of Baal and his prophets were exterminated.

   Of this power of the witnesses we have an example hereafter, (c. xiv.
   9.) "If any one say they shall worship the beast and his image, and
   shall receive the mark on his forehead, or his hand, he shall drink of
   the wine of the wrath of God; of unmixed wine poured out into the cup
   of his indignation, and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in
   the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up
   for ever and ever."

   Lastly, "they have power over the waters, to convert them into blood,
   and to smite the earth with every plague as often as they will." Moses
   and Aaron exercised a power of this kind when they were about to
   conduct Israel out of Egyptian slavery. Whence I collect, that the
   power of the witnesses, represented by this type, does not refer to all
   the days of the prophecy in sackcloth, but to the end of them, or the
   time of the phials; when indeed, under the auspices of the witnesses or
   prophets, as of Moses and Aaron, the Christian people, by plagues
   described under the image of those of Egypt, are in like manner to be
   led forth out of the tyranny and slavery of the beast. For the first
   plague of the phials smites the earth with a sore; by the second and
   third, the waters are turned into blood; the rest afflict with other
   and heavier plagues the adherents of the beast, or the Gentiles abiding
   in the court of the temple. The interpretation of all which we reserve
   for the proper place. Here it may be sufficient to have referred this
   last power to the effusion of the phials.

   "But when they are about to finish their testimony, the beast which
   ascendeth out of the abyss, shall make war upon them, and shall
   overcome them, and shall slay them.'"

   We have hitherto treated of the office and power of the witnesses; the
   fate now follows which they shall experience at the end of their
   prophecy, the description of which is wholly taken from the history of
   our Lord's passion. For the Lord Jesus, in like manner, when he was
   finishing his preaching, which lasted about as many days as the
   prophecy of the witnesses, was killed by the Roman president, a legate
   of that beast, which warred with the witnesses, (but in the shape of
   its sixth head.) The third day after, when there was a great earthquake
   also, he rose again; and a little after, namely, on the fortieth day,
   being received up in a cloud, he ascended into heaven. All which things
   God wished to represent in this slaughter of the witnesses or prophets;
   that as in the nature of their office they had borne a resemblance, as
   was stated before, to those illustrious pairs; so in suffering and
   death they should become conformable to Christ their Lord, that
   faithful Witness; which ought to be their consolation and their glory
   in the midst of their troubles.

   But let us throw light on the text. "When," says he, "they shall be
   finishing their testimony," (for so hotan telesosi should be
   translated, not by the preterite, when they have finished,) "the beast
   who ascends out of the abyss, shall make war upon them and shall kill
   them." That is, when at length, a part of the Holy City, or of the
   Christian world, having acknowledged the impurity of Gentilism,
   repenting, and cleansing the temple of God among them, and the
   witnesses rejoicing, shall begin to put off their sackcloth, and to be
   discharged from their daily lamentation, though they shall not be yet
   fully discharged from it, the seven-headed Roman beast in his last
   state, (of whom see ch. xiii.) indignant that the preaching of those
   hitherto-mourning persons should have prevailed, will make war upon
   them, conquer, and kill them: Of which, the first symptom of the
   lamentation of the witnesses beginning to come to an end, took place at
   the commencement of the Reformed Church, and has been continually
   repeated up to this present time. The other, respecting the war and
   slaughter, I suspect to be yet future. Our Brightman, indeed, supposed
   that it had been long ago fulfilled in the war of Smalcalde, under
   Charles the Fifth. Others accommodate it to the recent destruction of
   the German Churches. And who would not much rather wish that so sad a
   misfortune for the Church had already passed, than that it should
   remain to be apprehended? But the interpretation is not to be governed
   according to our wish; nay, the error will be greater on this side than
   the other; since the expectation of future calamity is more conducive
   to piety, than too credulous a security respecting it, as if already
   past. Two things persuade me that this last slaughter is .yet to be
   dreaded. The first is, that those sorrowful times, of the Gentiles
   treading under foot the Holy City, or the Christian Religion,--that is,
   the forty-two months, as long as the beast shall be reigning,--cannot
   be said to have completed their period; nor, therefore, the days of the
   witnesses lamenting in sack or hair cloth, contemporary and coeval with
   those months. The other is, that this destruction of the witnesses (as
   we shall in a short time see), is immediately antecedent to the
   overthrow and ruin of the great city, that is, of Rome, which the
   series of the phials will not permit to be at so short a distance, as
   we are not yet carried beyond the fourth of them, (though, in the
   present agitation of affairs, it is to be hoped, that is now passing,)
   as we shall then be instructed. But we will show, by-and-by, that the
   ruin of the city relates to the fifth, of which it is very probable
   that this slaughter of which we treat, will be the forerunner;
   especially since it is usual for our general Christ to contend with his
   enemies, and to bestow a victory upon his followers, only by the method
   of the cross. It does not follow, however, that because this should be
   the last slaughter, and even yet future, that any thing can certainly
   be determined of its severity, above all which preceded it. For perhaps
   it deserved a singular mention and description, not so much on account
   of its severity, (certainly, not of its duration,) as because it was a
   sign that the sorrows of the witnesses were then about to be
   immediately concluded, and of the impending ruin of the Roman city, and
   therefore alone was selected out of all the slaughters by which the
   beast would wear out the saints. In like manner, for instance, as the
   surrounding of Jerusalem by the army of Cestius Gallus, a little before
   the fatal siege of Titus, was predicted as a sign of its ruin then
   impending before the doors. For as our Saviour said to his apostles,
   inquiring about the signs of the time of its destruction, "When ye
   shall see Jerusalem encompassed with armies, then know that its
   desolation draweth near." So here it should seem to be intimated by the
   overthrow of Babylon; when you shall see that slaughter of the
   witnesses for three years and a half, then know that the desolation of
   the great city approacheth.

   But the destruction by which the witnesses are predicted to be
   overthrown, must I think be understood in a very general sense, in
   which it may comprehend death, metaphorically or analogically so
   called. In this notion, that is said to die, which in whatever state it
   was constituted, either political or ecclesiastical, or in any other,
   ceases to be what it was. Whence likewise he kills, who inflicts on any
   one such a death. For as in the sacred style, to live is oftentimes to
   be, to die, is not to be. In which sense, we are said to die to Satan
   and sin, when we cease to be any longer their servants; and to live to
   Christ, when we begin to be his.

   And the mode of opposition seems to require that as the resurrection of
   the witnesses to life, after the slaughter was perpetrated, should be
   of this kind, so the slaughter itself should be. But that is clearly
   analogical, because no resurrection properly so called, will take place
   before the advent of Christ, under the seventh trumpet; but this takes
   place while the sixth is still running on. [42]

   The death of the witnesses then in war, if we explain it according to
   this rule of interpretation, will appear to he their overthrow and
   dejection from that office and station in the Church, reformed by the
   force of their preaching, which they had obtained for a while, whether
   that may be joined with corporeal death or otherwise; so that the
   prophetic life which they had lived till that time, should from thence
   continue no longer, and that they should no more exercise their
   offices. By which, at the same time, it necessarily follows, that the
   columns being withdrawn, and the false prophets of the beast
   substituted in the place of the prophets of Christ, the whole polity of
   the reformed Church, as widely as this may happen, should fall to the
   ground. Which, whether it will come to pass sooner or later, He only
   knows, in whose hands are the times and seasons.

   In the mean time, lest any one should possibly be deceived, there is
   one thing to be accurately attended to, that this last war of the beast
   is not of the same kind with that which he had hitherto waged against
   the assembly of the saints, (of which indeed we shall speak in the
   history of the beast, c. xiii.) "that it was given him to make war upon
   the saints, and to overcome them;" but altogether of a different
   character. For why should that be related as peculiar to the last times
   of the beast, which if not from his first rise, at least from his acme,
   had been common to him? The war which the beast waged against the
   saints universally, is one; that which he wages in his last state, is
   another; namely, with the prophets who had begun to lay aside their
   prophetic lamentations with their sackcloth; that is, with the heads of
   the Church, reformed from his party. This is still more manifest from
   the different event of one war from the other; the former, indeed,
   prosperous, the latter very unfortunate. By the former, the beast
   obtained power over every tribe and tongue, and nation, &c.; by the
   latter he draws down upon himself a sudden and fatal destruction, as we
   shall see in the text. "And their dead bodies shall lie in the street
   of the great city, which is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where
   also our Lord was crucified." That city surnamed great, is Rome, so
   called, not so much with a view to its size, as because it was the
   queen of other cities, according to that saying of the angel, c. xvii.,
   "The woman which thou sawest is that great city which hath dominion
   over the kings of the earth." In like manner, by the name of the great
   king, (by which God is called, Ps. xlviii. v. 3, and Matt. c. v. v. 25,
   and which title was of old peculiarly suited to the kings of the
   Assyrians and Persians,) is intimated the king of kings, who has power
   over other kings. For which reason, throughout the whole Apocalypse, by
   whatever name Rome is otherwise called, whether of Babylon, or of the
   harlot, she is always distinguished by this title, great; as that great
   Babylon, that great harlot. Add that in the whole Apocalypse, this
   title is bestowed on no city besides, unless at last, after its fall,
   to the new Jerusalem, descending from heaven, in whose light from
   thenceforth the Gentiles should walk. Which whoever could suppose was
   intended here must have need of hellebore. But neither Jerusalem in the
   time of St. John, nor any other Jerusalem, except that, is ever to
   become "the great city," or the head or queen of the other cities of
   the world. It is added, "which is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt:"
   Egypt, on account of its tyranny; Sodom, on account of its fornication;
   that is, spiritual fornication. But here (as the reader should
   diligently observe) is a key to the allegory, (of which kind many occur
   in this book,) by which, in truth, the Holy Spirit means to intimate
   once for all, that whatever is any where exhibited in these visions of
   Egyptian plagues, or of the destruction of the Sodomites, is wholly to
   be interpreted pneumarikos, that is, mystically; since Rome, or the
   state of the Roman commonweal, the subject of all those plagues, was a
   mystical Sodom and Egypt. Then all references, too, to Egyptian plagues
   in the description of the trumpets and phials, as well as in this
   history of the witnesses; and of the destruction of the Sodomites in
   the judgment of the beast, c. xix. v. 20, and c. xx. v. 10; of all
   which the sense is to be opened by this key. Hence it may even be
   demonstrated, that the subject of the trumpets is the Roman empire;
   because of those plagues some are Egyptian. Now to what can Egyptian
   plagues be applied, but to Egypt? and this by the authority of the Holy
   Spirit is Rome.

   Respecting the great city, then, the meaning is plain, but what the
   plateia of the city may he, of which mention is here made, is not so
   easily to be known. For it seems, it cannot be taken for a street, or
   for what we call in Latin platea, or forum, or for any other place
   within a city, for the following reasons: In the first place, Christ
   our Lord, who is said to have been crucified in this plateia, was not
   crucified either in any street or forum of the city of Rome, or
   Jerusalem, but without the gate of the latter, (Heb. c. xiii. v. 12,)
   in a province thereof only, by Pilate the governor. Therefore the
   plateia of the great city is not any street or broadway within the
   walls of either of the cities, but a place without the city. Plateia,
   secondly, being put in the singular number, it is very probable that it
   designates a thing of that kind, of which a city has one only, and not
   many. But there are many streets in every city; at least in every one
   of consequence. Thirdly, it is supposed, that the bodies of the
   witnesses lie where they were conquered in battle; but it is not usual
   for troops to be gathered together within the walls of a city; but if
   not in the enemy's land, at least in the region and provinces subject
   to the city. Fourthly, "the people, tribes, tongues, and nations,"
   might see "the dead bodies of those who were slain for three days and a
   half," and not suffer them to be buried. It seems, therefore, that they
   did not lie in any way or street of the great city, but were either
   dispersed or spread abroad throughout the provinces, to which,
   consequently, the signification of tes plateias ought to be
   accommodated. [43] And if any one should say, that the army of the
   beast, by which the witnesses were routed and slain, might be composed
   of various people and tongues, and therefore might easily see the
   carcases of those whom they had slain, we must recur to the former; it
   is not customary for such armies to be gathered together within the
   walls of a city. For, undoubtedly, the subject is so to be explained,
   especially where no appearance of allegory can be pretended, that there
   should not be any absurdity in the literal sense. What else, then, can
   we say of this passage, but that by the expression of plateia, the
   whole region and territory, subject to the dominion of the city, was
   pointed out, and that such a signification may be drawn either from the
   Hebrew chvts, to which it often corresponds in the version of the
   Septuagint? namely, according to the custom and use of the Hellenistic
   language, which is wont to apply a Greek word answering in one
   signification according to its original use, to a Hebrew word
   signifying many things, in some other signification; as might be proved
   by many examples, if there were a question of this custom. chvts
   signifies with the Hebrews whatever is altogether external, either
   without the house, as streets and ways in cities; or without the city,
   as the circumjacent country or land. Job c. v. v. 10, where in the
   Hebrew it is tsl phny chvtsvt, the Chaldee renders it, "Who giveth rain
   on the face of the earth, and sendeth waters on the surface of the
   province, or on the region of the people." Or from a notion of width,
   that it may be the same as platos tes ges Is. c. viii. v. 8, "And the
   stretching out of his wings (that is, of the Assyrian) shall fill the
   breadth of thy land, O Immanuel!" and Apoc. c. xxix. v. 9, of Gog and
   Magog: "They came up upon the breadth of the earth, (epi platos tes
   ges,) and encompassed the beloved city." Now it makes for this
   interpretation, that rchv another word which the Septuagint translate
   plateian, and rchv which signifies breadth, or platos, has exactly the
   same letters, and each is called by the same word in the Chaldee, pht'h
   Or lastly, by the notion of breadth, which is the original meaning of
   the word plateian, the Holy Spirit meant to intimate the amplitude of
   the dominion of that great city, by which it surpassed all cities, and
   even at this day surpasses them, as if epi tes plateias was used for
   epi choras tes plateias, on the extensive country, &c. The word plateia
   is an adjective, used substantively, and therefore something ought to
   be understood, and it may be either one thing or another, to explain
   the interpretation, nor do I know whether that signification of street
   is often found among the ancient Greek writers.

   But now it can no longer be obscure to one by whom this interpretation
   is approved, either in what manner Christ may be said to have been
   crucified in the plateia of the Roman city, or when the carcases of the
   slain witnesses were to be cast out; namely, not in the city of Rome,
   but in the Roman domain. I know, indeed, that many of our writers, in
   order to arrive at the same conclusion, understand here, under the name
   of the city, the whole dominion of the city. But what then, I pray,
   will be the meaning of plateia? For of those two, of which it seems
   almost necessary it should be one, it can be neither; not dominion, as
   that is designated under the name of the city; not any province, though
   a great city has many; for plateia means something unique and singular,
   as it is put in the singular number. And this may suffice for our
   remarks on the plateia tes poleos tes megales. Let us now proceed to
   the remainder.

   "And (some) of the peoples, and tribes, and tongues, and nations, shall
   see their dead bodies for three days and a half, and shall not suffer
   their dead bodies to be put into monuments."--Whether this is to be
   taken in the sense of inhumanity or of kindness, is doubtful, and not
   to be decided except by the fulfilment of the prophecy. For it may be
   taken either as done by enemies, adding this for the sake of ignominy,
   to the slaughter which they had perpetrated, that they would deny
   sepulture to the bodies of the dead: Or by friends and favourers of the
   witnesses by this means consulting the interests of those who were soon
   to revive. For, however it may be held on other considerations, an act
   of the greatest cruelty, not to bury the dead, and to cast them out
   unburied, and especially among the Jews, as the greatest ignominy; yet
   to prohibit those who were so dead, as not to create a despair but they
   might again be restored to life, from being immured for a short time in
   the cloisters of the sepulchre, ought to be placed to the account of
   kindness. If the first is to be understood, some marks of infamy or
   ignominy seem to be intimated by this type by which the followers of
   the beast, not content with having made away with the witnesses, would
   inflict on them in addition. But if the latter, it may be some
   assistance from the reformed nations, out of fear of whom, as of a
   multitude, much the largest

   and therefore, while the wound was yet recent, and their affairs not
   yet confirmed, not to be provoked with impunity to desperation, or at
   least, by exertion and secret favour, it should come to pass, that they
   should not deal with the witnesses as if there were no hope of their
   revival.--Achmet, from the doctrine of the Indians, (Apotelesma, 130,)
   "If any one in dreams should seem to be buried, the sepulchre refers to
   the full certainty of his death. If he should seem to observe some
   deficiency of those things which pertain to sepultures, that deficiency
   must be placed to the account of hope. If now you should be disposed to
   inquire what appears in the text which would lead rather to one
   interpretation than the other, I would introduce this observation into
   the argument on the subject, that since he announces what is here
   suggested in a different mode, and in different words, and since he
   treats of enemies in the following verse, he wishes them to be
   understood, in this and the latter instance, not as the same, but as
   different persons. In the one case, indeed, as the enemies, in the
   other as the friends of the witnesses. For of the enemies, in the
   following verse, exulting and sending presents to one another, he says,
   "They that dwell on the earth," but of those who would not suffer the
   dead bodies of the witnesses to be put into graves, "they of the
   tribes, and people, and tongues," partitively, as if it would note
   certain persons different from the others in disposition. Let the
   reader judge.

   "For three days and a half." That is, as it appears for three years and
   a half, for the things which are there foretold, as to be performed,
   prove that it cannot be understood of horary days. For who can believe
   that the short space of three days and a half are sufficient either for
   disseminating the report of the slaughter of the witnesses through the
   world, or for sending messengers with gifts backwards and forwards
   among the nations. It is obvious that it would not be sufficient even
   for preparing them. To this must be added, that half a day, or twelve
   hours, is wholly inadequate for measuring acts of this kind. For these
   sort of things are accustomed to be marked, not by hours, but rather by
   months, or at least, by entire days. In the meanwhile it is to be
   observed, that the time is here to be computed, not from the date of
   the witnesses being killed, but from that in which they shall lie dead
   and inanimate, after they have been slain. But how long that war shall
   last, and how much time will be given to killing the prophets, the
   fulfilment of the prophecy only will explain. "And they that dwell on
   the earth shall rejoice over them, and be merry, and shall send gifts
   to one another, because these two prophets tormented them who dwelt on
   the earth." Of the custom of sending gifts in cases of public joy or of
   great rejoicings, vide Esther, c. ix. v. 22. "And after three days and
   a half, the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood
   upon their feet, and fear fell on those who beheld them."

   Such as the death of the witnesses was, such will be their awakening or
   resurrection from the dead; namely, their restitution to their former
   state; and that, not so much by any exertion or human assistance, as by
   the finger of God, who is wonderful in his works. For this is implied
   in the words, "The Spirit of life from God entered into them." Achmet
   says, (Apotelesm. vi. and vii. of the Doctrine of the Egyptians and
   Persians,) "If any one in dreams thinks he sees the resuscitation of
   the dead, it signifies the liberation of the conquered and the
   termination of wars." Apot. vi. Deliverance from Calamities. Vide Ezek.
   ch. xxxvii.

   "And they heard a great voice from heaven, saying to them, Come up
   hither. And they went up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies beheld
   them." Not only will the witnesses be restored to their former place
   and station, but they will be even elevated to a higher degree of
   honour and power. For that is the signification of being carried up in
   a cloud, and ascending to heaven. Vide Dan. c. vii. v. 13, and c. xix.
   v. 1. Whence in the interpretation of dreams which the Arabian I have
   so often quoted, Apomasar or Achmet, has collected from the ancient
   records of the Egyptians and Persians, we read, "If a king seem to
   himself to be seated in the clouds, and to be carried wherever he will,
   his barbarian enemies shall be reduced into subjection to him, over
   whom he shall preside with supreme command." Also, "If a king should
   seem to himself to have flown, as it were, to heaven, where the stars
   are, he shall possess eminence and distinction above other kings."
   Also, "If a king should seem to be carried upward to be seated in
   heaven, he shall reduce under his authority a larger region than that
   which he possesses." Apot. 162. 164.

   These I bring forward for the purpose of showing, that the parable I
   speak of is applied in that signification by the prophets, in which it
   is understood according to the use of the East. The ministry of the
   witnesses, then, will not be despised as before, nor they themselves
   treated as men of an abject and contemptible kind. So that what our
   Saviour said of himself, Luke, ch. xxiv. v. 26, "Ought not Christ to
   have suffered these things, and then to enter into his glory?" may
   acquire its force and truth in the example of the prophets likewise.
   And who knows whether the reformed Church may not undergo the reproach
   brought upon Christ on this behalf by the subduction of the witnesses
   for a time, because they had not treated them according to the dignity
   of their embassy, while they enjoyed it. It is too well known what is
   the sin of the reformed Churches in this case; and as, while the
   prophets of Christ were strenuously engaged in purifying the temple of
   God, some in the mean time contaminated that most holy work by
   pillaging its treasures, and embezzling its oblations, not having left
   a maintenance in some places, to the great disgrace of true religion,
   by which its ministers might be sustained honourably, and according to
   the dignity of their order, much less, a superabundance, that they
   might lay aside for the improvement of the reformed affairs, the
   necessities of a saored war, the aid of afflicted brethren, and for
   other pious uses: Was not this the kind of prevarication for which
   anciently the Jewish temple was profaned by Antiochus Epiphanes, and
   the religion of the true God given up to be trodden under foot, in like
   manner, for three years? "A host," says Daniel, "shall be given to him
   against the daily sacrifice, on account of prevarication, and it shall
   cast down the truth to the ground, and it shall practise and prosper,"
   ch. viii. v. 12. See the history, second Book of Maccabees, from the
   beginning of the third chapter to the fifth, and judge. But I will not
   press the matter any farther. This only will I add,--perhaps this
   increase of honour and power to the witnesses by their resurrection,
   will be brought about by the command of the Supreme magistrate, (which,
   perhaps, may be that voice from heaven,) as a compensation for the
   infamy and ignominy with which the followers of the beast had disgraced
   them when dead, supposing that to be signified by the prohibition of
   sepulture.

   "And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth part of the
   city fell, and there were slain in the earthquake (the names of) seven
   thousand men." At the time at which the witnesses or prophets returned
   to life, and ascended into heaven, there was a great earthquake, that
   is, a great commotion of the nations, and revolution of political
   affairs, by which, in fact, a way was opened to the witnesses, and a
   facility given them of returning to life, with such an increase of
   dignity and power. By that commotion of the nations, "a tenth of the
   city fell, and there were slain seven thousand names of men." That we
   may attain as nearly as possible in a future event to the meaning of
   these words, two things are to be pre-established and proved. First,
   since there is no misfortune attending the fall of the beast, but what
   is contained in some one of the phials, the same overthrow of the beast
   is here described as at the effusion of the fifth phial. The proof is,
   that the subject is the same in both plagues; in the former, the seat
   or throne of the beast; in the latter, the great city. That the great
   city is Rome, the seat of the beast, is so plain that it need not be
   proved. It is still farther confirmed, because the slaughter which is
   here described, so nearly precedes the full abolition of the beast at
   the seventh trumpet, that nothing is related to have intervened but the
   conclusion of the second woe; but now, at all events, the total
   destruction of the beast is the work of the last phial, the conclusion
   of the second woe, or of the plague from the Euphrates, of the sixth
   phial. Therefore the destruction of the great city, which immediately
   precedes that conclusion, agrees with the fifth phial. Another thing to
   be previously established by us is, that the ruin of the great city is
   that very destruction of Babylon, which is celebrated in the eighteenth
   chapter. This is proved, because it is certain from that same chapter,
   that the destruction of Babylon, or the Roman city, goes before the
   complete demolition of the beast and the august reign of Christ,
   beginning with the seventh trumpet. Now the destruction of the same
   city, which is here related, so nearly precedes that kingdom, that the
   Spirit, with the mention of no destruction beside, as intervening,
   passes at once to that kingdom, and the description of the seventh
   trumpet. It necessarily follows, that the same destruction of the city
   is described in both places. For who can bring his mind to believe that
   the Holy Spirit would have altogether passed over that very great
   desolation, and have introduced the mention of some smaller overthrow,
   by no means to be compared with it?

   This being the state of the case, it follows, that the interpretation
   of the passage is to be guided by the above rule, and is to be proved,
   as it were, by a touchstone; and therefore a meaning of these words is
   to be sought for, of such a nature as may agree with the description of
   that Babylonian destruction. Let us now see by what means this may be
   done. Philip Nicolai, a theologian of the Augustan confession, [44] a
   learned and acute man, thinks that by the Dekaton tes poleos is to be
   understood the decarchy of the city, or the ten kingdoms, subdued to
   its dominion, which indeed, in this concussion of the nations, revolted
   from Rome, to whose government they had been subject for so many years;
   and from thenceforward its commands were not to be obeyed. This, in
   truth, is what is said in another place. That "the ten kings who had
   delivered up their power to the beast, when the words of God were
   fulfilled, should hate the whore, and make her desolate, and naked,
   should eat her flesh, and burn her with fire." But this notion of the
   word Dekaton, however it had in the first place presented itself to me,
   while reflecting on the meaning of this passage, and though it pleased
   me very much from the appositeness of the event, yet afterwards, when I
   examined the matter more closely, appeared a little strained, and
   unusual; so that I fear it will not easily be approved by those who
   would desire a simple and unforced interpretation. I seek, therefore,
   for another. And first it suggested itself to my mind, that the tenth,
   perhaps, was the name of a tribute, either that which the high priest
   receives from the whole kingdom of the beast, or that which the city
   itself receives from its estates by the right of dominion. This tenth
   of the city, in that commotion of affairs, was to fall, that is, to
   fail, and therefore I inferred, that the principality of the city would
   be wholly extinguished; namely, despoiled of the territory bestowed on
   it for a patrimony, and its high priest driven from thence by force;
   that it would lose the prerogative and dominion which it was accustomed
   to exercise, to so great an extent over cities and people; since it
   would no longer be that which had procured for it prerogative and
   dominion, the metropolis of the kingdom of the beast, nor the seat of
   the false prophet. For it is well known, that tribute is the symbol of
   dominion, and that in this name, most of the provinces under the empire
   of ancient Rome paid the tenth part of their products every year. Which
   likewise may be proved to have been customary in the kingdoms of the
   east, both from the first of Maccabees, c. x. v. 31, and c. xi. v. 35,
   and from that summary of royal right, 1 Sam. c. viii. (for observe,
   what is said of tenths is not to be taken of sacred tenths or tithes:
   They were royal, accustomed to be paid to kings as viceroys of the
   gods,) which Aristotle also confirms in the second book of his
   OEconomics. It ought not, then, to appear strange, if any one should
   here affirm that under the name of a tenth, a representation so common,
   might be signified some kind of tribute belonging to the city. But
   there is no need to go back so far, since in Italy that mode of tribute
   has not yet been abolished, and besides, the Roman pontiff has long
   since renewed the image of -it in his ecclesiastical empire, by
   annually requiring a tenth part of ecclesiastical benefices. But to
   this interpretation it is an objection, that it seems it ought then
   rather to be called Dekate than Dekaton. Besides the word epese, it
   fell, by which some effect consistent with an earthquake must be
   designed, is not sufficiently suited to an interpretation of this sort.
   Nay, if it could be established, yet it would seem to express the fall
   of Babylon, with which we presuppose it to be identified too obscurely
   and faintly, and not in a suitable manner.

   At last, then, until any one shall suggest something more certain, and
   consonant to the text, I am brought to this conclusion, that I conceive
   by the tenth of the city, a part of the city is indeed to be
   understood, but not a part of the present city, but the whole of it,
   which is the tenth part of the ancient one. That this is the fact, and
   that not more than the tenth part of the ancient city of Rome, as it
   existed in the age of St. John, remains at this day, may appear from
   the: following reasoning. For Lypsius affirms, that ancient Rome, such
   as it was in the age of John, with respect to form, was nearly round,
   but not however exactly so. Its semi-diameter, from the golden
   milestone placed at the top of the Roman forum, to the extremity of the
   building, was about 7000 paces, that is, 7 miles, its circuit at length
   was 42 miles. Since then it was not exactly round, let us diminish its
   semi-diameter, in order to measure its area by one mile (as much as in
   a hexangular figure, according to a perpendicular to the side, it ought
   to be diminished). It will then be 6, which multiplied by 21, the half
   of the periphery, will give 126 for the area of the city.

   But modern, or pontifical Rome has only 13 or 15 miles for its circuit,
   as they know, says Lypsius, who have measured it. Its form, as may be
   seen from its ichnography, is an oblong, nearly quadrangular, in a
   proportion almost double. To measure which, let a rectangular
   parallelogram be constituted, whose perimeter may be 15, its length
   double the breadth; of which form, in fact, the sides will be 22 and 5,
   which multiplied into each other, will give an area of 121. Now the
   number 126 contains 10 times the number 121. The latter area, then, is
   the tenth part of the former, and consequently, modern Rome the tenth
   part of ancient. Q. E. D. Any one who is not much accustomed to
   reasonings of this sort, may apply the judgment of his eyes to the
   following diagram.

   Diagram comparing Ancient and Modern Rome

   We cannot, indeed, examine every thing here according to line and rule,
   but it is wonderful how near we can approach to it. I define the
   circumference of the present city by the walls by which it is
   surrounded, for beyond them, contrary to what was formerly the case, it
   is not at this day inhabited; but the whole contents, whatever they may
   be, are included within the walls; those walls which Hadrian the First,
   and Leo the Fourth, pontiff, erected, as it were, by a fatal instinct,
   as the boundary to that which had just been made the seat of the
   pontifical kingdom. For so Blondus relates, that the walls which now
   exist were built by Hadrian I. for 100,000 pieces of gold, collected
   from Tuscany. Those, as is remarked by others, Leo IV. afterwards,
   about the year of our Lord 850, either repaired or finished; and having
   added the Transtiberian or Leontine city to it, completed the city in
   the form and circuit in which it is now seen. And though it has much of
   the space included within the walls void and desert, yet since the
   walls are reckoned among the principal works of the city, the city
   itself cannot be considered as less extensive than its walls. Ampler,
   indeed, it might be, if, as the old one formerly was, it were extended
   every way beyond the walls by contiguous buildings.

   That I may at length draw to a conclusion, the sum of what I have said
   reverts to this; that the Holy Spirit means to say, or to intimate,
   that so much of the Great City as remained at this earthquake, should
   become a ruin at the time, viz. a tenth of the city; for there was to
   be no more remaining up to that period. Nine parts were to fall many
   ages before; and we in truth have seen them fall, partly by the
   destructions and devastations which the barbarians brought upon it at
   so many different times, partly by decay from great age, and partly
   overthrown by lightning, as we have pointed out under the fourth
   trumpet. The tenth part was reserved for the pontifical Roman fate,
   being constituted the head of a new empire, and the mother of Christian
   harlots. This part the earthquake, which is connected with the
   resurrection of the witnesses, will entirely demolish.

   Nor was it perhaps necessary that we should interpret the Holy Spirit
   as having spoken so rigidly as we have done, of the tenth part of the
   city, according to geometrical miles. It would have been sufficient,
   if, as formerly, he had spoken by his influence on Isaiah, c. vi. v.
   13. of the destruction of the Jewish people, "A tenth of it shall be
   preserved, and be brought back into the land." So here we may
   understand, not so strictly a tenth, as some very small part, about a
   tenth of the ancient amplitude of the Roman city, which should remain
   as the seat of the beast for the last destruction.

   It is added, "And there were slain in the earthquake seven thousand
   names of men." Here, if by names of men we understand heads of men, or
   individual men, the number seems too trifling, and not consistent with
   the magnitude of the slaughter, which the Holy Spirit elsewhere
   intimates. For in the destruction of Babylon, will there not be a far
   greater number slain than seven thousand men? And is it likely that the
   effusion of the fifth phial on the throne of the beast should terminate
   by so very small a massacre of men? In order to satisfy this doubt by
   some other means: First, it is to be observed, that by the name of the
   city is here to be understood, not the citizens and inhabitants, but
   the buildings and walls, that is, the royal seat of the beast; and so a
   double destruction of Babylon is described in these prophecies; first,
   of Babylon as the royal city of the beast, that is to say, of the Roman
   city at the fifth phial; afterwards of Babylon, as to the citizens or
   Roman state, which consists of the Pope, with the senate of empurpled
   Cardinals, and the other crowd of citizens, especially of
   ecclesiastics, who, after Rome has been destroyed and burnt, betook
   themselves to a habitation in some other place, and who are to be
   reserved for the last phial: at whose effusion it is said, over and
   above other destructions of nations and states in every part of the
   world, in that earthquake which was far the greatest of all that had
   ever taken place, even "that great Babylon came in memory before God,
   to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath,"
   c. xvi. v. 19; which, notwithstanding the burning and destruction of
   Babylon, described in the xviiith and xixth chapters, certainly precede
   the full extermination of the beast, and false prophet, as is there
   manifest from the text. I know some unravel this knot in a different
   manner, by saying, that Babylon, of which mention is made in the last
   phial, is Constantinople, the metropolis of the Turks; but they will
   never persuade me, that the Holy Spirit, in the first and principal
   image of all, has used so remarkable a synonyme, and that we are to
   understand two Babylons, and not one only, and the same, though with a
   double reference. To come, then, to the point. It may perhaps come to
   pass, that the first destruction of Babylon, that is, the devastation
   and ruin of the city of Rome, may be effected without any immense or
   total slaughter of the citizens. And though "her smoke was to ascend
   for ever and ever," that is, she should be wholly converted into ashes,
   and levelled with the ground, never again to be inhabited, yet a great
   part of the citizens might escape from the overthrow of the city,
   either because they would in time consult their safety by flight, or
   from some other cause, which the event will make manifest.

   And this is one mode by which the doubt may be satisfied about the too
   trifling number .of those who were slain. Another is, if we should say
   that by "names of men" are possibly intended men of name, or renown.
   For a hypallage of this kind is not unfrequent in the Scriptures, that
   in the order of the nouns, that which precedes is used in the place of
   an epithet. As for example, "The silver of the shekels," Lev. c. v. for
   shekels of silver; the uncleanness of man, for a man of uncleanness,
   that is, an unclean man, (ib. c. vii.) the law of justice, for the
   justice of the law; Rom. c. ix. the riches of grace, for rich and
   abundant grace, and the like. A name, besides, is familiar for
   celebrity in almost all languages, especially the sacred, in which men
   of name are illustrious men; sons without a name, (Job c. xxx.)
   ignoble; in Chaldee, vulgar persons. Whence Beza, in his Annotations on
   the Ephesians, c. i. v. 21, and Philipp. c. ii. v. 9, speaking of the
   exaltation of Christ above every name; as also Heb. c. i. v. 4,
   understands name in the signification of dignity and worth.

   If we follow an interpretation of this kind, (nor do I see what can be
   opposed to it,) the names of men will be dignities of men, onomastoi,
   men of name, illustrious men and excelling in dignity, of whom about
   7000 (and what if they should be of the order of the false prophet,
   which they call ecclesiastics?) should fall in this concussion of
   things and nations. The number, however, of 7000, I conceive to be so
   intended that a few more or less may be understood, according to the
   manner of Scripture. How great a number of the Plebeians are to fall in
   this war it does not belong to the subject to declare, since that may
   be conjectured from the slaughter of the nobles, nor did the Holy
   Spirit wish to descend so far as to reduce the dregs of the slain to a
   calculation.

   But still another interpretation may be given, which would not render
   it necessary to come to an enumeration of particular men; for instance,
   if we may interpret names of men as companies and societies of men, men
   accustomed to be called by their proper names no less than individuals,
   as are states, municipalities, parishes, villages, abbeys, and similar
   titles of human communities. For what are these things else, if we are
   desirous of forming the hypothesis, than names of men? for so is the
   political state of the Thebans called by Eschines Thebaion onoma, and
   the Roman name is used for the Roman people [45] .

   What, then, if out of these titles of human communities, whatever they
   may be, and whether at Rome, or in what they call the state of the
   Church, about 7000 are to be slain in this concussion of the nations;
   that is, they are to sink under adverse power, which Scripture,
   according to its usual style, has called death.

   But nothing is to be rashly pronounced concerning a future event, since
   the issue of things predicted is a commentary on the prophecy. These
   observations I have adduced that it may appear more clearly, as far as
   relates to words, that the interpretation may he more liberal than is
   commonly supposed, since the use of Scripture does not bind down the
   word name to any uniform and certain signification. For names of men
   are not to be found conjunctively any where else, than in the place now
   under consideration; nor are names to be found, singly of individuals,
   unless twice only, c. i. v. 15, Apo. c. iii. v. 4. The word is
   otherwise applied in a different signification. There remains, "And the
   rest were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven." That is, by
   their consternation; by which, even unwillingly and ungratefully, they
   acknowledged the finger of God. For to acknowledge, by whatever mark,
   the wisdom, goodness, or power of God, is to give him glory. As they
   who detected by God confess their sins, are said to give glory to God,
   as Achan. Then follows, "The second woe is past, the third woe cometh
   quickly." The meaning is, that the great earthquake should be continued
   till the end of the second woe, or sixth trumpet; and the mournful
   prophecy of the witnesses was at length to finish with it; since after
   such a victory over the followers of the beast, and their ascent into
   the heaven of power and honour, they would no longer be clothed in
   sackcloth. If the second woe, or the plague of the sixth trumpet, be
   the overflow of the Turks from the Euphrates in ancient time on the
   Roman world, as we then interpreted it, it can scarely be denied, but
   that the passing away of this plague, must be the drying up of the
   waters of the Euphrates at the effusion of the sixth phial, by which
   "the way of the kings from the east might be prepared," c. xvi. v. 12.
   From which coming of the kings of the east, (lest any interval should
   otherwise be left between the two trumpets,) the seventh trumpet seems
   to begin, and therefore that wonderful preparation of the dragon, the
   beast, and the false prophet, for the war to be waged at Armageddon, c.
   xvi. vv. 13, 14, together with its event at the last phial, v. 17, must
   be referred to the beginning of the same seventh trumpet. And indeed,
   it appears very probable, that the preparation for war belongs to the
   same trumpet as the war itself. But here a doubt arises, which requires
   solution, and therefore must not be passed over in silence. For since
   there is the same termination to the forty-two months of the beast as
   there is to the 1260 days of the mourning of the witnesses, and those
   days finish at the conclusion of the plague of the sixth trumpet, or of
   the second woe, it may not improperly be asked, why the months of the
   beast should not be extended farther, since, after this time, no small
   portion of the beast remains which is not to be put an end to, until
   the beginning of the seventh trumpet.

   It may be answered, that this takes place because at that time the
   conversion of Israel, and the new kingdom begin, (for they are called
   kings from the East,) or because, in the duration of the beast, the
   empire of the Roman city is chiefly attended to. But that great city,
   the royal residence of the beast, is taken and overthrown in that
   earthquake; so far that the beast from thenceforth will have in some
   degree changed his form, since his metropolis being thus demolished, it
   can no longer be considered as the kingdom of the seven mountains,
   (which is the other signification of the seven heads.) There still
   remains in the text the sounding of the seventh trumpet, and the august
   kingdom of Christ in the great day of judgment. The interpretation of
   which we will defer to the end of the book, that we may exhibit all the
   prophecies relating to it in that place, at the same time and in one
   point of view.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [39] Why should not the two witnesses be considered as the Old and New
   Testament, which during the apostasy of 1260 years were to be neglected
   and vilified as we see they are in Popish countries; but in the hands
   of sincere believers, properly applied, would produce the effects
   described?--R. B. C.

   [40] As these witnesses prophecy for 1260 years, (the whole time of the
   apostasy) to whom can the allusion be made, but to two testimonies,
   which might be constantly produced by the faithful against the
   corruption of the times; and I know not where we are to look for them,
   but in the books of the Old and New Testament, combined in the
   Bible?--R. B. C.

   [41] If this was a difficulty to Mede, it is almost presumptuous in any
   other to attempt an explanation. But there have been two revelations of
   light from God, under two dispensations, and preserved by two Churches
   or holy societies--the Jewish and the Christian. In the time of
   Zachariah, there was only one revelation, one church, one candlestick,
   and if we may be allowed to apply the two olive-trees to two figurative
   infusers, rather than to two persons, we may suppose them in the first
   instance to have designated the law and the prophets. But in the time
   of St. John there were two revelations, two churches, two candlesticks,
   the one illuminated by means of the Old Testament, now combining the
   law and the prophets, the other by the New Testament comprising the
   doctrines of Christ and his apostles. Reference is made to Zachariah,
   because be described the one and prefigured the other. May not then the
   two witnesses be summarily intended for the law and the gospel, or
   rather for the Old and New Testament?-- R. B. C.

   [42] If these observations be just, (and there is every reason to
   believe that they are,) what are we to think of the witnesses? They
   cannot be living persons in succession throughout the period of 1260
   years, because they die and revive metaphorically. Are they not, then,
   as I before observed, the twin parts of the true religion; that is, the
   law and the Gospel, contained in the Old and New Testament? Their
   death, therefore, will be the temporary dissolution of their
   acknowledged authority in some part of the world, by the success of
   infidelity for a short time; and their resurrection will be the
   reinstatement of their influence over the nations, in consequence of
   some signal revolution, which will carry conviction to the minds of
   men, and bow their necks to the yoke of Christ. Thus explained, the
   whole parable becomes consistent and intelligible.--R. B. C.

   [43] From hence, again, it appears obvious that the witnesses could not
   be two persons existing together at any one time, or in succession,
   because after death, such a description could not be applicable to
   their dead bodies; but rather two combined systems or modes of
   religious instruction, which might metaphorically be said to die and
   revive; that is, to be discarded for a while, and afterwards restored
   to just influence and authority.--R. B. C.

   [44] Confession of Augsburg.

   [45] This is much the most probable supposition as applicable to the
   numerous titles of ecclesiastics under the Roman Catholic hierachy.--R.

  THE MEANING

   Of the Red Dragon with Seven Heads fighting with Michael about the
   new-born Child.

   The first vision of the little book, of which we treated in the
   eleventh chapter, ran through the whole Apocalyptical course, from the
   beginning to the end, and that, as we elsewhere observed, to point out
   its connexion with the seals and trumpets. Now to that vision the
   remaining prophecies of the same interval, and of the affairs of the
   Church are to be accommodated, in order to complete the system of the
   little book. Of which, "the war of the red seven-headed dragon with
   Michael," comprises the same period as the measured court of the
   ecclesiastical state, in which the dragon, inhabiting the Roman empire,
   raged with dire persecutions against the Church with child, and
   travailing to bring forth Christ [46] as king over the Roman world, and
   for nearly three hundred years waged war against the Spirit of Christ,
   powerfully operating in his servants. But the woman at length, after
   throes in delivery, spoliations, and butcheries, gave birth to such a
   Christ [47] , brought forth a King "who was to rule all nations with a
   rod of iron," and the dragon, being dispossessed of the Roman throne,
   "there was" in that world "salvation and power, and the kingdom of our
   God, and the power of his Christ."

   This summary of the whole matter being premised, for the sake of
   clearness, let us come to the particular explanation of the text.

   "And a great sign (he says) was seen in heaven," whither John was
   called in the beginning to behold, and where he had seen all the
   foregoing visions. I do not think any other sense of this circumstance
   is to be sought for. For it is manifest even from the end of the
   preceding chapter, that John had hitherto beheld what passed in heaven.
   "A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her
   head a crown of twelve stars." A sign, and a very beautiful image of
   the primitive Church in a state of pregnancy, resplendent on all sides
   with the faith of Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, and treading under
   her feet the elements of the world, (whether the shadows of the Law, or
   the darkness of Gentile superstition;) glittering, lastly, with the
   insignia of apostolical origin. Many are inclined to consider the moon
   as a symbol of terrestrial and mutable things, which the Church of
   Christ looks down upon as beneath her. Though this may be true, yet
   never, I believe, in the whole Scripture, is the moon celebrated under
   this allusion. But the interpretation of prophetic symbols is not
   readily to be sought for elsewhere, but in those properties, by which,
   in some place or other, Scripture bears testimony to it. Now it is
   certain that most of the feasts on which they performed their holy
   rites, in typical worship, were described according to the changes of
   the moon; as the new moons, the passover, pentecost, the feast of
   tabernacles; nay, that the calculation of the whole ecclesiastical
   year, depended on its revolution. To which, perhaps, that passage in
   the 104th Psalm, v. 19, may refer: "He appointed the moon for seasons,"
   ltvdym that is, for feasts. Why, then, may not the symbol of the moon
   be referred to the Mosaic worship? which the Church, in truth, by the
   revelation of Christ, beholds as prostrate, and placed under her feet;
   according to that observation of the apostle to the Colossians, ch. ii.
   v. 14, in which he asserts that "Christ had blotted out the
   hand-writing of ordinances which was against us, and had taken it away,
   having nailed it to his cross." Moreover, as God may be said to have
   created the sun as the greater luminary, for the dominion of the day,
   and the moon, the lesser luminary, for the dominion of the night, why
   should not the symbol of the moon, appointed to the presidency over the
   night, signify what is the display of the power of darkness, or
   blindness, that is, the worship of Satan and his demons in idols? So
   that indeed the whole matter may be transferred to baptism, in which
   the Church, illuminated, and from thenceforth to be clothed with
   Christ, tramples under foot the worship of idols, with a renunciation
   of Satan and his angels, his service, and his pomps. For all these
   things the ancient formula of renunciation expressly contained; and
   besides, the abjurors turned to the West, as to that part of heaven
   from whence the night arises, as, on the contrary, the professors of
   faith in Christ, and in the true Triune God, turned to the East, as the
   quarter from whence the sun, after the night has passed away, brings
   back the day. (Dionys. Arcop. de Hierarch Eccles. ch. ii. Cyril
   Hierosol. Catech. i. Mystagog.--Greg. Nazian. Orat. xl.--Hieron. to ch.
   vi.--Amos. Ambrosius. Of those who are initiated into Mysteries, ch.
   ii.) Moreover, with a regard to the same figure (as was also observed
   above), the duration of the apostasy, or of Christianity defiled by
   idols, is described by months, according to the motion of the moon, but
   that of the woman and the witnesses persevering in the faith of Christ,
   by years and days, with reference to the motion of the sun. To which
   interpretation I should in preference accede, I am somewhat in doubt,
   and whether to one only, or to both. In truth, the apostle to the
   Galatians, ch. iv. seems to call both, as well the Mosaic tutorship as
   the worship of Gentile idols, promiscuously the elements of the world,
   and the Church of Christ rejoices that both are subdued under her feet.
   Let the reader use his own judgment.

   "And being with child, she cried out in pain, and labouring to be
   delivered." The Church, whenever she is regarded universally and
   abstractedly as an imaginary person, is a mother, but when with respect
   to individuals, who are produced in her continually, she has offspring
   which she is said to bring forth to God. This is so obvious in the
   prophets, that it is unnecessary to add a word more respecting it. Vide
   Ezekiel, ch. xvi. to v. 21, also ch. xxiii. v. 4, Isa. ch. liv. Hosea,
   ch. ii. v. 4, 5. The allegory, then, is not to be disturbed by the
   unreasonableness of any one, because he would distinguish the mother
   from her offspring, which, however, in another sense, coalesce in one
   and the same Church. Kimschi on Hosea, ch. ii. v. 2, 3, "The synagogue
   or congregation is compared to a mother by way of universality, but the
   several individuals to children."

   Those pains and torments on account of which the woman in childbirth
   cried out, were those severe persecutions which the primitive Church
   endured at the time of her delivery. For it is well known that
   tribulations and distresses are compared to the pangs of childbirth.
   Whence those words of Isaiah, ch. lxvi. v. 7, "Before she travailed she
   brought forth; before her pain came she was delivered of a male child."
   The Chaldee has this paraphrase: "Before tribulation come upon her, she
   shall be redeemed; before trembling come upon her as the pains of a
   woman in labour, her King shall be revealed, that is, the Messiah." But
   Jeremiah himself interprets this image, ch. xxx. v. 6, 7, "Ask now and
   see, if a man do travail with child? Wherefore do I see every man with
   his hand on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned
   into paleness? Alas! because that day is great, and there is none like
   it. It is even the time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out
   of it." See also what our Saviour calls hodinas, Matt. ch. xxiv. v. 8,
   9, Mark, ch. xiii. v. 9, "These are the beginning of sorrows," odinon,
   &c.

   "And there appeared another sign in heaven, and, behold, a great red
   dragon, having seven heads and ten horns; and upon his heads seven
   crowns. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and
   cast them upon the earth." This is the sign or image of the heathen
   Roman empire worshipping the dragon; inasmuch as his emblems
   universally are seven heads and ten horns; seven heads both on account
   of the seven hills on which the city was built, and on account of the
   seven orders of kings or dynasties which would successively rule the
   empire of that city; but the ten horns are so called on account of the
   ten kingdoms, which were to rise in the time of its last head (upon
   which they grew,) which interpretation is not mine, but that of the
   angel, ch. xvii. where there will be a more convenient opportunity of
   treating on these matters, if any thing requires to be added. In the
   mean time, another character of the Roman empire is here subjoined, for
   it is said to have drawn "a third part of the stars of heaven with its
   tail, and cast them on the earth;" that is, to have subjected a third
   part of the princes and dynasties of the world to its empire. For so
   much, namely a third part of the globe known in the age of John, the
   Roman dominion circumscribed within its boundaries,

   Now the tail, according to the doctrine of the Indians in Achmet,
   generally signifies attendants and followers of power, Apot. 152; but
   what more the tail of the serpent may imply, will be seen *by-and-by.
   And these, indeed, were the characters of the Roman empire universally;
   but the representation of a dragon determines the worshipper of the
   dragon and the enemies of the woman's seed specifically, that is, as
   heathen, and the adversary of the Christian name; and since he is red
   likewise, it points him out as cruel, and crimson with the blood of the
   saints. Add that, under the type of a dragon, reference seems to be had
   to Pharaoh, the dire and malignant enemy of the ancient synagogue,
   travelling in Egypt, as the Roman of the Christian Church in
   childbirth. For he also, in a similar manner, and on the same account,
   is clothed with the image of a dragon, Psalm lxxiv. v. 13, 14, "Thou
   hast divided the sea by thy strength. Thou hast broken the heads of the
   dragons, (that is, of the Egyptians) in the waters. Thou hast broken
   the heads of Leviathan (Chaldee, of Pharaoh). Thou hast given him to be
   meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness." Isaiah, ch. li. v. 9,
   "Awake, awake! put on strength, O arm of the Lord! Awake, as in the
   ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not he that hath cut
   Rahab, and wounded the dragon?" Ezek. c. xxix. v. 3, "I am against
   thee, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the great dragon." In all these passages
   the Hebrew word is r which the Septuagint, Symmachus, and Jerome,
   interpret the dragon; and, indeed, the Syrian interpreter always calls
   the dragon in the Apocalypse by the same word. For the confirmation of
   which, Drusius says, that it is the Arabic language in which the dragon
   is called Thennin. And Exod. ch. vii. "Aaron threw down his rod before
   Pharaoh, and it became ltphyn a serpent, or dragon:" It signifies,
   indeed, elsewhere, a whale or grampus, but then as a marine dragon,
   whose form in some respects it resembles. But why, you will say, is so
   much stress laid upon this word? Why, in order to show that in the
   resemblance which Satan first abused, in subverting Adam, it is the
   custom of the Holy Spirit, under the type of that disgraced and
   accursed animal, to designate the kingdoms infested by the devil, and
   hostile to his church, the seed of the woman.

   "And the dragon stood before the woman, who was about to be delivered,
   that when she should bring forth, he might devour her child." That is,
   as Pharaoh did to the ancient Israel springing up in Egypt, and as
   afterwards Herod did to Christ, the Son of Mary, our Lord, so the Roman
   dragon laid wait for the mystic Christ, whom the Church was about to
   bring forth, that he might oppress him immediately after his birth.

   "And she brought forth a male child, who was to rule all nations with a
   rod of iron" (or an iron sceptre). That is, she brought forth a mystic
   Christ, or Christ formed in his members, not the Son of Mary, but of
   the Church, according to that of the Apostle to the Galatians, c. iv.
   v. 19. "My little children, of whom I travail in pain again, till
   Christ be formed in you." For since the words are a periphrasis of
   Christ, it is necessary that some Christ should be intended by them, as
   in the prophetic types is frequently the case, not truly, but
   analogically spoken; "who," says he, "was to rule all nations with an
   iron sceptre," that is, with power produced by the force of iron, or
   war, as he was about to have dominion over those who were not
   originally his citizens, but either enemies, or foreigners, whom it
   would be necessary to subjugate before he governed. The words are taken
   from Ps. ii. v. 9. not according to the present Masoretic reading, but
   the ancient one of the Septuagint, and of the apostles. Of which
   authors, I think I can collect, that this is the meaning, from c. xix.
   v. 15. where in like manner as in the Psalm, they are applied to Christ
   our Lord, to whom they primarily belong. "Out of his mouth," says he,
   "went a sharp sword, that with it he might smite the nations; and he
   shall rule them with a rod of iron." Here the words are applied to the
   mystic Christ, or the Christian man, the offspring of the church among
   the Gentiles, who is represented under the type of Christ his Head, and
   to whom the Lord promises that he would sometime give a power of a
   similar nature with his own, under the name of the Church of Thyatira.
   "He that overcometh," says he, "and keepeth my works unto the end, to
   him will 1 give power over the nations, and he shall rule them with a
   rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to pieces;
   as I also have received of my Father." It will be some assistance here,
   to attend to the words of Andrew, in which, according to the opinion of
   Methodius, he comments upon this place. "The Church," says he, "without
   intermission, by those who are initiated in baptism, generates Christ,
   as to be formed in them, to the complete fulness of spiritual growth.
   The male child is the people of the church, by whom Christ, as God, by
   the hands of the Romans, strong as iron, rules the nations." He alludes
   to the type of the fourth kingdom in Daniel, in which I do not agree
   with him, (for how could David have alluded to that?) otherwise he is
   not wide of the mark, as will soon appear.

   "And her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne." A hendiadys
   [48] for the throne of God. The son of the woman was caught up to the
   throne of God, that is, was elevated to the Roman throne, where, with
   that power with which it was declared that he was about to rule, he did
   rule the nations. Christ, the Son of Mary, was indeed truly raised to
   the throne of God; but the mystical, or supposed Christ, whom the
   apostolical Church brought forth analogically, since the throne of the
   higher powers is, as the apostle calls them, Rom. c. xiii. the throne
   of God, the terrestrial heaven. "For there is no power," says he, "but
   of God." Whence, in the divination of dreams, "If any one should appear
   in a dream to be carried up into heaven," they interpret it of a royal
   exaltation. It is well known, likewise, in the sacred language, that
   magistrates are called 'lhym, that is, gods. "God standeth in the
   congregation of the mighty, he is a Judge among gods." Ps. lxxxii. 1.
   "I have said ye are gods, and ye are all the children of the Most
   High." v. 6. As those then are said to sit in the seat of Moses, who
   teach the doctrine delivered by Moses; so those may be said to sit on
   the throne of God, who exercise his functions in the earth. When,
   therefore, the offspring of the apostolical Church is said to be caught
   up, or taken to the throne of God, it is the same thing as to be
   elevated to such a height, as to sit as it were next to God, which, I
   say, is true of royal eminence. Now this was fulfilled, when the
   Christians under Constantine the Great, and his successors, became
   possessed of power, after the Dragon was cast out.

   But you will say, since the mystic Christ is said to be appointed to
   rule the nations over which he presided, in the same manner as Christ
   the Lord, with an iron sceptre, in what warfare, or by what battles (if
   this be the signification of the iron sceptre), did the offspring of
   the apostolic Church subjugate to himself the Roman world? I answer, by
   a double warfare. The first, spiritual, wonderful, and divine, against
   demons, the princes and gods of this world, which, indeed, with an army
   of celestial angels fighting with him against his enemies, he manfully
   waged, of which we shall treat in the sequel; the second, strictly
   corporal, when he had just attained the throne, which so many
   illustrious victories prove partly of Constantine over Maxentius,
   Maximinian, and Licinius; partly of Theodosius the Great against
   others, as well as Eugenius and Arbogastes, the standard-bearers of
   demons, before the contumacy and pride of the Gentile worshippers of
   the Dragon, rebelling against Christian government, was fully broken,
   subdued, and laid to rest.

   But before we leave this subject, one thing still remains to be
   observed, namely, that not immediately as the offspring of the woman
   was brought forth, was he raised to the throne of God, but as soon as
   he came to maturity in the kingdom. Therefore she is said to have
   brought forth a son, who was to rule, that is, not immediately, but
   when he came of age. As Christ, the Son of Mary, our Lord, (to whose
   image this mystic Christ, the offspring of the Church, is in all things
   conformed), was in like manner, not as soon as he was born, but when he
   had arrived to a proper age, raised to the throne of God, and took
   possession of the kingdom, there to sit till he had reduced his enemies
   under his footstool.

   "And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she bath a place
   prepared for her by God, that they should nourish her there, one
   thousand two hundred and sixty days;" of which, as it is afterwards
   repeated, and somewhat more fully described, we will defer the
   explanation to that place.

   "And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the
   dragon, and the dragon fought, and his angels: And they prevailed not,
   neither was their place found any more in heaven." It was said, that
   the mother having brought forth, as soon as her child was safe, escaped
   the snares of the dragon. But how it came to pass, that he who had so
   diligently watched her, should yet have failed in his attempt, now at
   length begins to be related. We learn that this happened by the aid,
   and under the auspices of Michael, who went strenuously to oppose the
   dragon, as he lay in wait; and when at length he became his superior,
   threw him down from heaven to earth. Thence the son of the woman not
   only escaped unhurt, but was raised to the throne of God, and she
   withdrew into a secure place from the fury of the dragon. "And there
   was war in heaven." Namely, while the woman was bringing forth, not
   after she had brought forth, as many suppose. For it is certain from v.
   14. that this war was carried on before the flight of the woman into
   the wilderness. But the woman did not flee into the wilderness before
   she had brought forth, and before her son was caught up to the throne
   of majesty, v. 5 and 6. "Michael and his angels fought with the
   dragon," not alone, but with the assistance of the martyrs and
   confessors of Christ their King, by whose grace they fought; of whom,
   therefore, it will soon be sung in the hymn of victory, that "they
   overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and for the word of his
   testimony, and they loved not their lives unto the end;" which cannot
   be said of angels only. "And the Dragon fought, and his angels," that
   is, demons, with the assistance likewise of their worshippers, the
   Roman tyrants and their ministers.

   But who, you will ask, is Michael? Not, I think, Christ himself, but,
   as it appears from Daniel, unless I am mistaken, one of the chief
   princes, or seven archangels, nay, the first, c. x. namely, that great
   angel, who is said by the same author, to stand up on the part of the
   people of God, c. xii.; and whom, therefore, Christ, the great General
   in chief, and the King alike of angels and men, employed in opposition
   to the fury of Satan and his followers against his people. For the
   angels are sent forth for the salvation of those who are the heirs of
   God," Heb. c. 1. [49] and who protect and defend them according to a
   mode of acting secret and unseen, against evil spirits, who operate on
   such men as are enemies of God, and his Christ, although they do not
   appear in a visible shape. So in this war, in which we are treating of
   the primitive Church of Christ against the Roman worshippers of the
   dragon, the angels took part under Michael their leader, either by
   confirming the holy martyrs and confessors of Christ against the
   threats and power of tortures, and in diminishing their pains in their
   last agonies, and sometimes taking away entirely even the sense of
   pain; or by breaking and debilitating the attacks of their spiritual
   adversaries, and by throwing in the way of their persecutors, who acted
   under their influence, sometimes obstacles, and impediments, arising on
   a sudden, and so stifling their attempts; sometimes by infusing terrors
   and other alienations of mind, so that suddenly desisting from their
   undertakings, they even unwillingly granted to the Church a truce, and
   breathing time; until at length, after a war of three hundred years,
   when Christ saw that his people were sufficiently tried, and he
   determined to give a full victory to his angels, when the offspring of
   the woman was placed on the imperial throne, and the Christians were
   possessed of power, the kingdom of the devil being vanquished, fell
   with a wonderful ruin. For this is what he says,--"The devil prevailed
   not, neither was a place found for him any longer in heaven;" that is,
   routed and chased with all his forces, he was cast out of heaven,
   ("Prevailed not," is a Hebraism, of which hereafter.) "And the great
   dragon was cast out, that old serpent which is called the devil, and
   Satan, who deceived) the whole habitable world;" (that is, impels it to
   idolatry, and had hitherto been seated in the Roman empire;) "he was
   cast out to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him." That is,
   he, with all his demons, hitherto worshipped as gods, were hurled down
   from the summit of divinity in which they gloried, to the depth of
   execration and contempt. As what we read to have been done formerly in
   the liberation of Israel from the tyranny of the Egyptian Pharaoh, to
   whom the dragon bears a resemblance, that "God executed judgment on all
   the gods of the Egyptians," (Ex. c. xii. v. 12; Num. c. xxxiii. v. 4,)
   the same found a place here likewise, at least, according to the words.
   The Jews have a tradition, that it took place there likewise. Vide both
   Targums, R. Salomon, R. Aben Ezra, with R. Moses, Ben Nachman, &c. Nor
   is there ground for any one to pervert the clear words of Scripture to
   any other sense, especially since Isaiah appears to allude to it, c.
   xix. v. 1.

   "Prevailed not," for was conquered, is a Hebrew figure, as I observed;
   by which adverbs of denying signify the contrary of that to which they
   are applied. As in this very vision it is said a little farther, "They
   loved not their lives unto the end;" that is, they reckoned their lives
   of no account, or they gave them up for Christ. For this mode of
   speaking among the Hebrews is not diminution, but augmentation. So
   Prov. c. xii. v. 3, "A man shall not be established by wickedness;"
   that is, he shall be utterly removed and eradicated. Id. c. x. v. 2,
   "The treasures of wickedness profit not;" that is, they are hurtful,
   they are destructive. Id. c. xvii. v. 21, "The father of a fool shall
   not rejoice;" that is, he shall be affected with sorrow. And 1 Cor. c.
   xvi. v. 22, "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be
   anathema;" that is, whoever hates and curses him. Vide Burtorf Thesaur.
   Gramm. lib. 2, c. xix. So here,--the dragon and his angels prevailed
   not, is the same as they were completely overcome.

   But I have already given a fuller history of this victory in the
   interpretation of the sixth seal. with which this fall of the dragon
   contemporises; nay, it is the subject of that seal, as far as it
   regards the remarkable change of the Roman empire. But what 1 have said
   of the offspring of the woman placed on the imperial throne, and of the
   Christians then possessed of power, is clear and manifest from the song
   of triumph which is subjoined--"And I heard a loud voice in heaven
   saying, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our
   God, and the power of his Christ, for the accuser of our brethren is
   cast down, who accused them before our God day and night."--"And they
   overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their
   testimony, and they loved not their life unto the death." Which words,
   as they are very clear, and delivered without any veil of allegory, so
   they are a key to the interpretation of the whole vision. For, from
   hence it may be clearly perceived, in the first place, what the
   elevation of the offspring of the woman to the throne of God would be,
   namely, the introduction of "salvation and might, and the kingdom of
   God, and the power of his Christ," to the Roman throne; and likewise by
   the conquest of what enemy, he should come to the kingdom; namely, by
   the overthrow of that accuser, who calumniates and traduces the
   brethren clay and night before God; and lastly, what kind of forces
   Michael and his angels should employ in this battle against the dragon
   and his satellites, namely, the holy martyrs and confessors, "who
   overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of his
   testimony, because they loved not" (that is, they gave up) "their lives
   unto the death." And, indeed, it is utterly impossible that the
   elevation of the offspring of the woman, the overthrow of the dragon,
   and the introduction of the kingdom of God, and of his Christ, should
   not correspond with one and the same event, since the flight of the
   woman into the wilderness begins from all as from one termination of
   affairs. But why is Satan here called by the name of Kategoros, or
   Accuser? It is to be understood that this arose from the usage of the
   Hebrews, by whom he was anciently called by the same name, which they
   made their own. For they call him qtgvr, Kategor. R. Juda, in the book
   Musar, as cited by Drusius, says, Kategor is Satan, the wicked
   adversary or calumniator, who is an adversary to man, and calumniates
   him before the blessed Creator. Maimonides in Pirke Avoth, (where in a
   sentence of R. Eliazar, both this, and the word Paraclit of a contrary
   signification, likewise derived from the Greek, occur,) says, He is
   called Paraclit, Parakletos, or the Intercessor, who intercedes with
   the King, for a good blessing for man; the opposite to whom is Kategor;
   for he it is who traduces man to the king, and endeavours to destroy
   him. And, indeed, if ever Satan deserved the name of accuser or
   calumniator on any other occasion, strictly deserved it during the time
   of this childbirth, and the war attending it. Witness the many
   calumnies and reproaches with which the dragon-worshippers overwhelmed
   the Christians, during this whole time, objecting to them Thyestoean
   feasts, Edipodian incests, adultery, promiscuous concubinage,
   homicides, conspiracies against princes, pestilence, famine, fires, and
   whatever public calamity took place. But there rather appears here to
   be a reference to the book of Job, where Satan, by calumniating and
   accusing him, was the cause of Job's being permitted by God to be
   proved by him with temptations and tribulations. Which here, likewise,
   the Holy Spirit intimates, was done by him after his accustomed manner.
   The intelligent reader will understand what I mean. Then follows in a
   song of triumph--"Wherefore rejoice, ye heavens! and those who dwell
   therein," (that is, holy angels, and blessed spirits, by whose
   exertions this victory has been obtained.) "Woe to the inhabitants of
   the earth and of the sea," (that is, to the terrene world,) "for the
   devil is come down to you, having great wrath, (and therefore prepared
   to contrive some new mischief,) knowing that he hath but a short time."

   For though from the time when he was cast down by Constantine the
   Great, from the Roman throne, the worship of the dragon continued for a
   short space among the people; yet when he foresaw that not long after
   he should be expelled likewise, and that the whole Roman world would be
   sprinkled with the baptism of Christ, in the progress of events; being
   wholly inflamed with anger and fury, he took counsel how he might bring
   the victory of the Church into hazard, by whatever means he could
   employ; and if lie should fail in the attempt, even when cast out, he
   might subvert it by some new contrivance. In both of which designs we
   shall see that the most wicked spirit was not wanting to himself.

  THE MYSTERY

   Of the Woman dwelling in the Wilderness.

   The woman delivered of a child, when the dragon was overcome, from
   thenceforth dwelt in the wilderness, by which is figured the state of
   the Church, liberated from Pagan tyranny, to the time of the seventh
   trumpet, and the second Advent of Christ, by the type, not of a latent,
   invisible, but, as it were, an intermediate condition, like that of the
   lsraelitish Church journeying in the wilderness, from its departure
   from Egypt, to its entrance into the land of Canaan; a state,
   therefore, safe from the fury of that red dragon, who resembled
   Pharaoh, but not yet arrived at that pitch of glory, to which it should
   finally arrive, when the rest of her enemies should be subdued, as by
   the possession of Canaan. A state, indeed, which was externally better
   than the servitude of that heathen tyranny, (out of which, as from
   Egyptian slavery, the Christian people emerged by the power of Christ,)
   as from thenceforth endued with a power, under the auspices of
   Christian emperors and kings, of worshipping Christ freely, as the
   Israelites in the wilderness of worshipping Jehovah; with temples,
   likewise, as the tabernacles of Christian worship, magnificently built,
   with an ecclesiastical polity, constituted by kings, with sacred
   revenues, tithes, and oblations, but unhappy by its apostasy of various
   kinds, not less than Israel in the wilderness, with the calf,
   Baal-peor, Balaam, Korah, &c. Nor, perhaps, should that circumstance be
   passed over, that the forty-two months of the Christian woman's
   residence in the wilderness answers to the number of resting-places of
   Israel in the wilderness. Vide Numbers, c. xxxiii.

   The reason and tendency of the type being thus explained, let us
   illustrate the text particularly, and apply it to the event.

   "And when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth, he
   persecuted the woman who brought forth the male child. And there was
   given to the woman two wings of a great eagle, that she might flee into
   the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and
   times, and a half, from the face of the serpent. And the serpent cast
   forth water out of his mouth after the woman, like a river, that he
   might cause her to be carried away by the flood."

   This was the first attempt of Satan, when he was cast down, but not yet
   entirely cast out, remaining, on the contrary, a short time below. That
   he might, if it were possible by any means to do so, overwhelm the
   woman, who, when her offspring was possessed of power, was departing to
   a station in the wilderness, before she should retreat thither wholly
   secure from his fury. For she did not immediately, as she began to
   escape, arrive in the wilderness, but after some space of time and
   delay had intervened; as Israel consumed some time in the journey which
   he had undertaken from Egypt. But the words here used are so to be
   understood, that they may appear in some way to be referred to what was
   said above of the same flight of the woman into the wilderness, either
   in this, or in a similar sense. "When the dragon saw that he was cast
   down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who had brought forth the
   male child." For since (as was observed above) "there was given to the
   woman," after the birth and exaltation of her offspring to the throne,
   (by two wings of a great eagle furnished to her, as if for flight) "to
   depart into the wilderness, where she was to be nourished for a time,
   and times, and half a time; he cast out of his mouth after her a flood
   of water, that he might cause her to be carried away with the flood."
   So, likewise, Pharaoh persecuted the people of Israel, departing into
   the wilderness out of his dominion, by a flood of another kind.

   The great eagle is the Roman empire. Its two wings, the two Cæsars of
   the now divided empire of the West and East, under whose protection and
   authority the church departed into its eremitical state. For it is well
   known, that the Roman empire, as soon as it had received the Christian
   faith, became bipartite, and was borne up as it were on the two wings
   of the Cæsars. The eagle being the ensign of the Roman empire, renders
   this interpretation obvious to any one. But what forbids us from
   confirming the interpretation of the prophetical type by an apocryphal
   writer? This is Esdras the prophet, for under this denomination does
   Clemens of Alexandria quote him, (Strom, book 3d, a little before the
   conclusion) according to whom, the type of an eagle signifies the
   fourth kingdom, the twelve feathered wings as many first Cæsars. Vide
   c. xi. and xii. But tell me, Reader, would you not also say, that here
   is a reference also to that saying of the Lord concerning the departure
   of Israel out. of Egypt. Exod. c. xix. v. 4. "Ye have seen," says he,
   "what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and
   brought you unto myself," that is, into the wilderness. But there is
   something else in this verse which requires to be expounded. Why is the
   time of the woman's inhabitation in the wilderness, which was reckoned
   a little before by days, here changed into years, or a time, and times,
   and half a time? I seek no other cause of this alternation, than that
   it might be the key to a similar notation of time in Daniel, and might
   inform us that the Church was now arrived at those very times, which he
   described by the period of a time, times, and half a time. And, indeed,
   without this index, that designation of time would have been very
   uncertain, and inexplicable. For from what source, or by what
   indication, could it have been known, that time denoted a year? or if
   so, that times did not mean more than two years? But now, from this
   communication it is clear, that the period may be resolved into 1260
   days, and therefore, signifies a year, two years, and a half.

   These difficulties having been explained in this manner, let us now
   examine what that water was which the dragon vomited out of his mouth
   like a flood, that he might. overwhelm the woman while she was
   preparing to take her journey into the wilderness. The gushing out of
   water is language and doctrine according to Prov. c. xviii. v. 23. "The
   words of a man's mouth are deep waters, the well-spring. of wisdom is a
   flowing brook." Whence the word nk, which signifies to burst forth, and
   gush out as a fountain, is applied to doctrine, as Ps. lxxviii. v. 2.
   "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter, or pour forth, things
   hidden from the foundation of the world;" which is alleged of the
   doctrine of our Saviour, Matt. c. xiii. v. 35. So Prov. c. i. v. 23.
   Wisdom is said to preach in the streets; "I will pour out my Spirit
   upon you; I will make known my words unto you." What, then, is the
   effusion from the mouth of the serpent, a venomous beast, but
   pestiferous doctrine, that is heresy? according to that verse of Prov.
   c. xv. v. 28. "The mouth of the wicked poureth forth evil things." Now
   the history of this time exhibits it as proceeding like a flood from
   the mouth of the dragon,--I speak of Arianism and its offspring. By
   this his flood the dragon had nearly caused the woman to be carried
   away. He intended it no doubt. And, in truth, it was wonderful that the
   Roman emperors, who had so recently given their names to Christ, and
   had not fully settled the Christian establishment, offended and
   alienated as they were at the horrid dissension in so primary a point
   of doctrine among Christians (only just respiring from persecution), at
   such deadly party feuds, tumults, and credulity, among the brethren,
   even equally to that of the Pagans, should not have cast off the faith.

   "But the earth succoured the woman, and the earth opened its mouth, and
   swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth." That
   is, the multitude of Christians in the councils persisting in the
   orthodox faith, exhausted the diabolical inundation, as the earth does
   water, when it has long continued in a state of drought. For if water,
   (but of a poisonous and pestiferous nature) such as proceeds out of the
   serpent, represents heresy; the mode of analogy undoubtedly required
   that the substance which should have the effect of absorbing and
   removing the same, should be figured by the earth, as that whose
   property it is to exhaust an inundation of waters by its aridity.

   Which, indeed, happens in this matter so much the more agreeably to the
   explanation of the subject, because elsewhere likewise in historical
   and simple expression, the earth is commonly used for the inhabitants
   of the earth. Vide Gen. c. xli. v. 37. 1 Sam. c. xiv. v. 25. Deut. c.
   ix. v. 28. and elsewhere at large.

   Of the Ten-horned Beast blaspheming God, and of the Two-horned Beast,
   or False Prophet, his Founder and Hierarch.

   A new scene of evils invaded the woman, as soon as she had entered the
   bounds of the wilderness; for she immediately encountered a double sort
   of beast, less formidable indeed in appearance than that of the dragon,
   or serpent; whose figure only she dreads, professing to be nothing but
   a panther, or a lamb, but being truly an agent of the dragon, who has
   been cast down, and in his stead prepared to bring troubles on the
   offspring to which she should give birth in the wilderness.

   "And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and departed to make war with
   the rest of her seed, (viz. with those which she should produce in the
   wilderness,) who keep the commandments of God, and hold the testimony
   of Jesus Christ."

   "And he stood on the sand of the sea." That is, when the dragon saw
   that he who was now expelled from the Roman empire, that he had not
   succeeded in overwhelming the woman, as she was hastening into the
   wilderness, by the inundation of Arianism, but that she nevertheless
   had arrived there in safety; and besides, that he should no longer be
   suffered to possess the sovereignty of the Roman world, as he had
   formerly done, in his own name, he now attempts it in another way, by
   tacitly substituting a kingdom dependent on himself, and for that
   purpose he stood on the sea shore, that he might form a new appearance
   of the Roman kingdom, thence to arise, subservient to him. The history
   of the double beast, prepared to transact the affairs of Rome, now
   follows; one ten-horned, and the other two-horned, connected by the
   strictest necessity with each other, and both reigning at the same
   time, and in the same part of the world. The first of which, that is,
   the ten-horned beast, you may call if you will secular; the other, or
   two-horned, ecclesiastical.

   Of the Ten-horned Beast.

   The ten-horned, or secular beast, is that university of ten kingdoms,
   more or less, (into which the empire of the Cæsars, after the expulsion
   of the dragon, had settled after the Barbaric plague,) coalescing at
   length into one Roman republic, through the renewed impiety of the
   dragon.

   "I saw," said he, "a beast ascending out of the sea, having seven
   heads, and ten horns, and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his
   heads the name of blasphemy." The same beast is here described as that
   which afterwards, c. xvii. carries the harlot; the seven-headed Roman
   beast, under the state of its last head. "I saw," says St. John, "the
   type of that last state of the Roman kingdom, in which, acting under
   its seventh head, it was divided into ten kingdoms; and yet in the same
   manner, as it had done under its former heads, he blasphemed the great
   God Almighty by the worship of idols." For the number of seven heads is
   a particular mark of the Roman kingdoms, as well as the furniture of
   ten horns. The name of blasphemy is the mark of idolatry. The diadems,
   or crowns, placed on the horns, (which are on the last head only,)
   point out that the kingdom is exhibited under the government of its
   last head, which will be amply confirmed by the remaining description
   of the beast.

   "And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet as those of
   a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion." That is, this kingdom,
   partly in respect of its regimen, and its state, partly in respect of
   its disposition, was so composed, that it represented the three
   monarchies, anciently pourtrayed by these beasts in Daniel, in a
   certain blended association. Since it was Greek in the remaining
   appearance of the body, it stood on feet in their march and action,
   like the Persian kingdom; with its mouth, like that of Babylon, it
   issued its edicts to be performed. For the leopard is the type of the
   kingdom of the Greeks, the bear of the Persians, the lion of the
   Babylonians. First, then, that kingdom was plainly like the Grecian in
   its body, for instance, a kingdom like that divided into many parts,
   Dan. c. vii. v. 6. and c. viii. v. 8. 22. For the Greek was divided
   into four parts; this last Roman kingdom was separated into ten
   kingdoms, to which type is referred the bearing ten horns on the last
   head of the beast, which the angel afterwards interprets, c. xvii. are
   ten kings, or kingdoms, into which the Roman empire of the sixth head,
   having been dilacerated, coalesced into a new kingdom, under the
   seventh, for the purpose of carrying the harlot. That the ten horns
   were upon the last head only, that is, the seventh, and not, as
   commonly supposed, promiscuously on all, I thus demonstrate. While the
   head flourishes, the horns flourish, and when it falls, the horns also
   arising from it must necessarily fall. On the first five heads, then,
   there could not be horns, because those five heads, as the angel says
   in c. xvii. were already fallen; neither could there be on the sixth,
   because while that was reigning in the age of John, (as the angel
   expressly affirms,) the time of horns was not yet come, for says he,
   "The ten horns are ten kings, which have not yet received their
   kingdom." They are reserved, therefore, for the last head. Away, then,
   with such painters as distribute the ten horns according to their
   fancy, on seven heads, giving single ones to some, and two to others,
   out of their liberality, which, how inconsistent it is, and remote from
   the groundwork of the text, yea, and plainly repugnant to the
   interpretation of the angel, there is no one, who, having been already
   informed on the subject, shall seriously weigh it in his mind, that
   will not be induced to confess. Therefore, it is to be taken as true
   and certain, that the seventh head alone in the scale of heads, raising
   themselves one after another, towered over the rest, the highest in
   situation, the last in place.

   Now then I proceed to explain the remaining appearance of this last
   beast. By the feet on which the body rests, and on which it is moved,
   and walks, and of which those before answer the purpose of hands and
   arms to beasts, in holding, seizing, and fighting; by the feet, I say,
   it alludes closely to the Persian empire; since, as they relied on the
   councils of their Magi in the management of their affairs, so the Roman
   kingdom in its last state is governed by the authority of idolatrous
   monks and clergy, like those Magi. To which that future saying refers
   of the other falsely prophetic beast, "that it exercises all the power
   of the ten-horned beast before him." For the feet are to be considered
   here, not as the lowest and most dishonourable parts of the body, but
   of the same kind as they are in beasts; not merely the instruments of
   walking, but also of fighting, and seizing their prey, in which, and in
   bears especially (I speak of the fore feet), the chief strength of the
   body consists. Nor are the feet to be here understood as that part only
   which makes an impression on the ground, but that which comprehends the
   thighs also, and arms, as well as the smaller part commonly called the
   foot.

   Lastly, the ten-horned beast issues edicts to be observed with a
   Babylonian mouth, by commanding the worship of deities and idols, with
   pain of death, and burning alive, denounced against those who refuse
   it, in the same manner as Nebuchadnezzar did to those Jews, who would
   not adore the golden image which he had set up, sixty cubits high, to
   his god Bel. Dan. c. iii. At the same time, I do not wish, by this
   interpretation of mine, to excite a prejudice against that of others;
   namely, of those who may think that regard should be had rather to the
   natural disposition of those beasts, whose qualities or fierceness the
   ten-horned beast might express. Let every one judge for himself. "And
   the dragon (who had been cast down, and stood on the sea-shore,) gave
   him his power, (that is, his strength or forces,) and his throne, and
   great authority."

   Power, Dunamis, signifies, with the Hellenists, forces or army,
   according to the use, as it appears to me, of the Hebrew chyl, by which
   is denoted both strength and bravery, and an army likewise. The Seventy
   say, in Exod. c. xiv. v. 28. of the army of Pharaoh overwhelmed in the
   sea, "The waters covered, pasan ten dunamin, all the host of Pharaoh,"
   and c. xv. v. 4, "he hath cast, ten dunamin autou, his host into the
   sea." And so in various passages, not only in these, but in profane
   writers. From this notion spring those expressions, Kurios dunameon,
   the Lord of hosts, and Matt. c. xxiv. v. 29. dunameis ton ouranon, the
   powers of the heavens, or the celestial hosts, shall be shaken. So, in
   the next verse, the Son of man is said to be about to come in the
   clouds of heaven, meta dunameos kai doxes polles, with power and great
   glory, which is explained in the following chapter, us "coming in his
   glory, and all the holy angels with him." So in this place, the dragon
   or Satan delivered to the ten-horned beast, ten dunamin autou, that is,
   his forces, or his army. But the forces of Satan are his angels or
   demons, and idols, the receptacles of demons. These forces he delivered
   over to this last beast, to be worshipped and reverenced, together with
   his throne, and great authority; that is, in one word, all that power
   from which he had lately fallen, when conquered and overthrown by
   Michael, and the holy martyrs and confessors of Christ. So that,
   indeed, the dragon, or Satan, in this beast of the last state of the
   empire, recovered in some measure the ancient dominion which he had
   exercised in the red one; but in a form so dissimilar from the former
   one, that the seed of the woman in the wilderness did not immediately
   perceive it. For the dragon did not now make his advances as before, in
   the form of a dragon, that is, did not profess himself to be what he
   was, the sworn enemy of the Christian name. For if he had done this,
   the seed of the woman would have known him immediately, and been upon
   his guard against him, as his deadliest foe, from that innate antipathy
   which God had denounced from the beginning of the world should subsist
   between them. "I will put enmity between thy seed and her seed." But,
   in truth, when he had assumed the form of another beast, having no
   affinity with the serpent, it was not so difficult for him to impose
   upon the seed of the woman, that is, the Christian Church, rejoicing in
   its late victory, and now secure from the dragon, and to allure it to
   adopt his customs. Which, indeed, the arch impostor so covertly and
   deceitfully did, under the mask of a beast not friendly to him, that
   the Church did not acknowledge till late, that she had been deceived by
   her ancient enemy, and led to venerate the dragon under this mask. For
   who would have suspected that the dragon lay hid under the figure of a
   leopard, or (what is the same) of a panther [50] , that is, under the
   appearance of an animal, which, while other beasts, attracted either by
   the beauty of his skin, or the sweetness of his smell, love to approach
   and behold, the dragon alone is said to abhor and avoid? Or, to explain
   the matter a little more clearly, who would have supposed, that under
   the empire of the Christian religion, the destroyer of idols assuming
   worship for herself, heinous idolatry, and long since exploded
   heathenism, would be restored with the utmost labour, and promoted by
   laws and edicts?

   "And I saw one of its heads, (namely, the sixth,) as it were, wounded
   to death, (which was done in the battle with Michael and the holy
   martyrs [51] ,) and his deadly wound was healed," by the medicine of
   this vicarious power. That this seven-headed dragon, (or the Roman
   empire, possessed by the ancient serpent, that is, the heathen empire,)
   was the beast with the sixth head, may be shown by what is afterwards
   said of these heads. Five in the age of John had fallen, one (which is
   the sixth) then ruled the Roman states, and chiefly because this beast
   of the last dynasty immediately succeeded the fifth, on the same
   throne. The dragon, I assert, is here said to have given up his throne
   to the beast of the last dynasty, or the seventh head. Therefore he was
   the immediate successor, or the beast of the last head. Nor let any one
   be disturbed, that during the continuance of the sixth head, it appears
   seven-headed in the vision. For though the heads performed their parts,
   not at the same time, but in order, and successively, yet the beast is
   exhibited with all its apparatus of heads and horns, under every state,
   that it may every where designate the same Roman kingdom, though under
   different successions of dynasties.

   But to return to the text, in which, in the Complutensian edition,
   according to the testimony of Irenæus, Aretas, the Syrian paraphrast
   lately published, and among the Latin authors, Primasius does not
   acknowledge the words "I saw," but joins the words, "one of the heads,"
   with the word "gave," as in this sentence, "The dragon delivered unto
   him his power and throne and great authority, and one of its heads
   mortally wounded, that it might be cured." I suspect also that the
   Latin Vulgate read it so formerly, on account of the words "de
   capitibus suis," instead of "ejus." But whether this reading is to be
   preferred to the other, I will not hastily affirm, but only that it
   appears to be very ancient, so that I wonder it was not noticed by R.
   Stephen. But whichever it may be, the received reading, if rightly
   interpreted, and as the subject actually requires we should interpret
   it, evidently gives the same sense. "I saw (says he) one of the heads,
   as it had been wounded to death ," namely, not at the time the apostle
   saw it, but before it emerged in this form from the sea,
   hupersuntelikos, or in the

   preter-pluperfect tense, as in ch. v. ver. 6, he had said, he "saw in
   the midst of the elders and of the animals a Lamb standing, as if it
   had been slain," not slain at the time he saw it. What is added,
   however, about the healing of the wound, that he saw done, either while
   the beast was just emerging from the sea, or as soon as it had arisen
   from thence? For that healing was not, (as is still believed by many,)
   some subsequent fate, but the very nativity of the last beast. From
   each of the remaining heads, it had passed to the turn of the successor
   without a wound; but in the transition from the sixth to the last, the
   beast sunk under a deadly wound; from the cure of which I say, and not
   before or sooner, the ten-horned beast, or that of the last state, took
   its beginning, and did not deduce its origin any higher. That this is
   the case, the whole series of the following narration evinces. For
   whatever evil the beast is related to have perpetrated, whatever
   worship and adoration was paid to him by the inhabitants of the earth,
   all is said to have been done after the cure of his wound. "I saw (says
   he) one of his heads as if it had been wounded to death, and the wound
   of death, or the deadly wound, was healed, and all the world followed,
   wondering after the beast,"--namely, that just healed," and they
   worshipped the dragon," &c. Then likewise "was given to him a mouth
   speaking great things, and blasphemies," &c. And "he opened his mouth
   against God," &c. All those things were done after his cure; but before
   that, no evil deeds are predicated of the beast, no mention of
   subjection or honour paid to him by the nations. Whatever is
   commemorated before, partly relates to the form of the beast, partly to
   the occasion and manner of his rise. And why, I beseech you, should we
   represent to ourselves an antichristian beast, of whom for some time,
   no facts are related, no persecution recorded? Nay, if we follow the
   reading of Irenæus and the Complutensian version, by expunging "I saw,"
   there will be no longer a place for such an interpretation. "And all
   the earth wondered after the beast;" that is, with the utmost
   approbation and consent, they went over to the party of the beast. "And
   they worshipped the dragon, which gave power to the beast, and they
   worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able
   to make war with him?" That is, they did not simply worship the beast
   as a beast, but also as a vicegerent of the dragon. Therefore they did
   not venerate the beast alone, but the dragon himself likewise, under
   the mask of the beast. For to worship the beast, unless so far as
   idolatry discharged the functions of the dragon, in the sense in which
   it is here used, would not have been more impious than to obey any kind
   of mundane power.

   The beast, in truth, denotes a kingdom. To adore the beast, then,
   according to the usage of the Hebrew and Oriental languages, is the
   same thing as to be subject to him, which the explanation subjoined to
   the word worship, not obscurely points out. "They adored (says he) the
   beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is capable of contending
   with him?" As if he had said, They devoted themselves willingly to the
   obedience of the beast, as to one who so far excelled others in power,
   that there was no one that would resist or make war with him. In which
   also, ver. 12, the earth itself, not merely its inhabitants, is said to
   have worshipped the beast; that is, to have yielded to his dominion.
   "And he caused (says he) the earth, and those that dwell therein, to
   worship," &c. So in the benediction of Jacob, Gen. c. xxvii. v. 29,
   "Let the people serve thee, and nations worship (or bow down to) thee.
   Be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee."
   For this meaning of the words tou proskunein, vide Gen. c. xxxvii. v.
   7, and c. xlix. v. 8, in the benediction of Judah; so also Isa. c. xlv.
   v. 11. But to be subject to the beast according to his religious
   constitution, as it refers to the seven-headed dragon, is blasphemous,
   and impious towards God. Whence, they who so adore the beast, are said
   to adore the dragon in adoring the beast.

   "And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and
   blasphemies, and there was given him power to continue forty-two
   months."

   Hitherto of the constitution and state of the beast. It is afterwards
   explained in what things he exercised the power committed to him by the
   dragon; viz. in two,--in blasphemy towards God, and the persecution of
   the saints. The whole description is taken from the prophecy of Daniel,
   ch. vii. where he treats of the same subject, as here, that is, the
   Roman beast in the last state. But the circumstances which are there
   related to Daniel by the angel, rather succinctly, are here more
   diffusively laid open, as in an interjected explanation.

   "There was given to him (says be) a mouth speaking great things." The
   mouth speaking great things is Daniel's; but here the great words are
   explained by "blasphemies;" under which name, it will presently be
   asserted, idolatrous worship was designated, as a matter of the highest
   affront to God.

   Moreover, he says, that the beast should so blaspheme for forty-two
   months; that is, of years, throughout the same space of time, as the
   Gentiles should trample down the outer court of the temple, or the holy
   city. And not undeservedly, since that profanation of the Gentiles runs
   in a parallel line with the same impiety as this blasphemy of the
   beast, and both point out a subject of the power of darkness and of
   night, and therefore to be measured, not by years or days, but months,
   according to that of the moon, which presides over the night. And,
   indeed, unless the Holy Spirit had intended the designation of time to
   be referred to the blasphemy, why has he inserted it in this place,
   immediately after the mention of blasphemy? The months are not to be
   reckoned from the beginning of his cruelty, or warfare with the saints,
   but of his blasphemy. As if the word poiesai signified some certain
   act, or state of the power of the beast, (of which kind some suppose
   that to be, which is here called the power of acting or doing.) it must
   then altogether be referred to the act of blasphemy. But to poiesai
   seems rather to be applied in the senses of lasting or remaining, as it
   is elsewhere used with words of time. For thus, Acts, ch. xv. v. 33,
   ?poiesantes de chronon tina, "when he had spent some time;" and ch. xx.
   v. 3, ?poiesas te menas treis, "and there abode three months." 2 Cor.
   ch. xi. v. 25, nuchthemeron en to butho pepoieka, "a night and a day I
   have been in the deep." Add James, ch. iv. 13, "to-day or to-morrow we
   will go into such a city," kai poiesomen ekei eniauton hena?, "and
   continue there a year." Drusius remarks that sh is thus used, Eccles.
   ch. vi. v. 13, and "facere" in Latin, Seneca, Epist. lxvii. "Quamvis
   paucissimos unà fecerimus dies."-- "Though we have passed very few days
   together." In the marble tablet, "cum qua fecit annos ix." "Where, when
   he had continued nine days." In Alfenus, i. e. "Is servus fugerat et
   annum in fugâ fecerat." "That slave had fled, and passed a year in
   flight;" that is, spent, continued, finished, transacted.

   According to these examples, why should not "poiesai menas 42," signify
   lived so long, remained, continued blaspheming? The force of which
   expression, those who did not understand, seem to have inserted in the
   text the word "polemon war," which is extant in some of the copies.
   Now, as I said before, that by the name of blasphemy in this place, was
   designated, as by way of eminence, idolatry, or spiritual fornica. don,
   may be evinced by a twofold, or even a threefold argument. First,
   because Babylon, the metropolis of this beast, means the mother of
   harlots, and with her the kings and inhabitants of the earth are said
   to commit whoredom. But the beast of which we treat, is nothing else
   than the community of those kings and inhabitants. Secondly, it must be
   a blasphemy of the same kind, which should suit with the state of the
   head, immediately preceding nay, of all the other heads for on all
   "were written the name of blasphemy," ver. 1. Add that this beast of
   the last state, was born and composed from the renewal of the impiety
   of his predecessor of the sixth head. But what blasphemy could be
   ascribed as common to them all, except idolatry alone? Assuredly none
   [52] .

   The use of Scripture adds force to these observations, by expressing
   the idolatry of God's ancient people by this name. To understand which
   it must be known that there are three words in Hebrew, translated by
   the Greek interpreters and the Latin Vulgate in the acceptation of
   blasphemy, n'ts, and chrph, in none of which you may not discover the
   sign of idolatry. In the word ndph, Ezek. c. xx. v. 27, "Yet in this
   your fathers have blasphemed me. When I had brought them into the land,
   for which I lifted up my hand to give it them, then they saw every high
   hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered their sacrifices," &c.
   In the word chrph, Isa. c. lxv. v. 7, "Which have burned incense on the
   mountains, and blasphemed me on the hills." And certainly chrph answers
   precisely to the Greek blasphemein , for both signify to treat with
   contumely, or to reproach. Whence, 2 Kings, c. xix. v. 22, "Whom hast
   thou reproached and blasphemed?" it is joined with ndph, as synonymous;
   as also Ps. xliv. v.16. The Seventy are in the habit of rendering both
   by oneidizo, p9aroxuno, and the Chaldee also by its own chrm. Moreover,
   let me add this likewise, that it was usual with the Jews, not only of
   the age of Isaiah, but also of a lower age, to understand the worship
   of idols by the nomenclature of reproach or blasphemy. This may even be
   collected from the paraphrases of the Hagiographists, where, Ps. lxix.
   v. 10, instead of the words, "The reproaches of them that reproached
   thee are fallen upon me," the Chaldee has, "The rebukes of the impious
   who rebuke thee, while they make their idols partakers of thy glory,
   are fallen upon me."

   With respect to the word n'ts, which is another of the two, to which
   blasphemein answers, according to the Seventy; in Forster it is, to
   attack with contumacy, reproaches, and reviling words. Jerome always
   translates it in the Psalms, as often as it occurs, (and it occurs five
   times,) according to the true interpretation of the Hebrew,
   blasphemare. With others it is, to despise, or to irritate by contempt,
   so that the most accurate signification of it seems to be, to provoke
   to anger by reproaches and contumelies. By this expression, I say it
   may be shown from Deut. c. xxxi. v. 20, that idolatry is designated, as
   well as by the former. "When they shall have eaten and filled
   themselves, they will turn to other gods, and will serve them vn'tsvny,
   and will provoke me." So, indeed, the Vulgate uses the sense of
   blaspheming, though not the word. For what else is Deo detrahere, to
   detract from God, than to blaspheme him? But in other places it does
   express the word, as Jer. c. xxiii. v. 15-17, "From the prophets of
   Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land."--"They say
   lmn'tsy unto those that blaspheme me, (the discourse is about
   idolaters,) the Lord hath spoken, There shall be peace to you, and to
   every one who walketh after the imagination of his heart," &c.

   To these quotations may be added, if you please, by way of
   illustration, that the profanations of Antiochus, by which he polluted
   the temple of God, and his sacrifices, are called blasphemies, 1 Macc.
   c. ii. v. 6, and 2 Macc. c. viii. v. 4. Also, that Kimchias interprets
   that of Gen. c. iv. v. 26, "Then was the name of the Lord profaned by
   invocation [53] ." Then men turned away after idols, and the invocation
   of the divine name was polluted and profaned. Whether he has translated
   rightly or not I do not inquire, but so he has rendered and understood
   it. Hence according to the scholastic doctors there are three species
   of blasphemy; one, when something is attributed to God which does not
   belong to him; another, where something is taken from him which does
   belong to him; a third, when what is appropriated to God, is attributed
   to a creature, as in idolatry. For as an adulterous wife brings a
   reproach upon her husband, so the Church, prostituting herself to
   idols, does upon God; since idolatry is spiritual adultery.

   "And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his
   name, and his tabernacle, and those that dwell in heaven."

   What he had before said generally about blasphemy, he here pursues in
   detail, and distinguishes a triple idolatry of the beast: For first, he
   blasphemes the name of God; that is, in the worship of images. "By
   giving the incommunicable name to stocks and stones." Wisdom, c. xiv.
   v. 21. Or the name of God means the person of God, (may we be permitted
   thus to speak,) which is then blasphemed, when any thing besides God is
   worshipped with divine honour. Secondly, his "tabernacle;" that is, the
   human nature of Christ, in which the Deity hypostatically dwells. Ho
   gar logos sarx egeneto kai eskenosen en hemin, John, c. i. v. 14. And
   according to the same Evangelist, c. ii. v. 19, "Destroy this temple,
   and in three days I will raise it up. But he spake of the temple of his
   body." Has not that passage in the Hebrews, c. ix. v. 11, a reference
   to this "In a greater or more perfect tabernacle." This tabernacle, I
   say, the beast blasphemes, when he believes the body of Christ to be
   made every day out of bread, by the transubstantiation of the mass, and
   therefore worships the bread instead of Christ, the tabernacle of God;
   nay, looks up to the propitiatory sacrifice offered for the living, and
   the dead, as crucifying Christ anew. He blasphemes the celestial
   inhabitants likewise, that is, the angels and saints, who dwell in
   heaven, whilst in their names he invokes the demons and idols which he
   worships [54] .

   What a reproach is this to the blessed spirits! nay, an affront to
   Christ their Lord: In derogation of whose prerogative and glory they
   are constituted, even against their will, mediators and intercessors
   with God, patrons and presidents of mortals in the manner of the
   heathen. See what we have already said, at the end of the sixth
   trumpet, out of the theology of the Gentiles on demons and their
   offices. And the beast, not content with this alone, degrades the
   blessed spirits besides, with his disgraceful and wicked fables and
   miracles; so that you may doubt whether he offends more by the worship
   which he wishes to display, as addressed to them, or by the injurious
   nature of his fables.

   Thus far of blasphemy, then follows the other part of the impiety of
   the beast, by which he exhibited himself as the vicegerent of the red
   dragon,---the persecution of the saints. For in addition, "it was given
   to him to make war upon the saints, and to overcome them." So Daniel,
   "He made war with the saints, and prevailed against them." With the
   saints, that is, with the seed which proceeded from the woman in the
   wilderness. Now, though the whole domination of the beast may be a kind
   of warfare against the saints, (according to what was said at the
   beginning, "that the dragon went away enraged," under the mask of this
   beast, "to make war with the rest of the woman's seed, who keep the
   commandments of God, and retain the testimony of Jesus Christ,") yet a
   war of another kind is here to be understood, as appears from v. 10,
   where something is said of retaliation to be at some future time
   rendered to the beast. "If any one lead into captivity," &c., and "If
   any one kill with the sword, he must be killed with the sword." The
   war, therefore, is one which is waged with slaughter and blood. Add
   that we are at present engaged in the description, not of the
   ecclesiastical, but of the secular beast, with which war of any kind
   can scarcely agree.

   But the beast did not carry on this war immediately from his
   commencement; but after he had arrived at his acme, during the twelfth
   age from the birth of Christ. His first expedition threatened the
   Albigenses and Waldenses, and by whatever other name the true
   worshippers of Christ were called; of whom so great a destruction was
   made, that throughout France alone, if P. Perronius, in his history of
   the war, has made a right calculation, there were slain about a million
   of men. For not only was this war carried on by burnings alive, by the
   loss of goods, by exile, and other kinds of punishment, but that
   nothing might be wanting to the true appellation of war, in such an
   inhuman persecution, whole armies were raised against them, and those
   crusading expeditions, first undertaken against the Saracens, being now
   turned against the Christians, of that chaste and pure religion which
   refused to adore the beast, it raged cruelly for about seventy years,
   with incredible fury and inhumanity.

   The histories of this butchery are to be met with, to which I refer the
   reader. I choose to subjoin the words of Thuanus, a most illustrious
   historian, but of the opposite party. He says, in the Preface to the
   History of his own Time, "Since exquisite punishments were of little
   avail against the Waldenses, and what was unseasonably applied as a
   remedy aggravated the evil, and their number every day increased, a
   regular army was at length raised, and a war of no less magnitude than
   that which our people had formerly waged against the Saracens, was
   resolved upon against them; of which the issue was, that they were
   brought to their senses, rather by being slain, routed, every where
   despoiled of their goods and dignities, and dispersed on every side,
   than by being convinced of their error. Therefore, they who had
   defended themselves in the beginning by arms, being at last conquered
   by arms, fled into Provence, and the Alps bordering on the French
   domain, and there found retreats for their life and doctrine. Some
   departed into Calabria, and remained there for a long time, and even to
   the pontificate of Pius the Fourth; part passed over into Germany, and
   fixed their habitations among the Bohemians, in Poland and Livonia;
   others turning to the West, found refuge in Britain."

   Now in this war the memorable fact happened, that those Albigenses who
   were conquered at Morell with a great slaughter by Simon Montfort, the
   leader of those who were signed with the cross, seem to have seized on
   this prophecy of the saints conquered by the beast, as an argument for
   consolation and constancy. [55] For when the Bishop of Toulouse,
   interposing to prevent the slaughter, admonished the remnant, who
   remained in tents, by sending to them a religious person, that,
   convicted by such a scourge, of God's being angry with, and pronouncing
   a judgment upon them, they might at length, (having laid by their
   hard-heartedness) be converted to the faith which they call Catholic;
   but they, on the contrary, retorting that the conquered were the people
   of Christ, by this kind of shield frustrated the attack of temptation,
   and all to a man fell bravely, being slain by a band of soldiers
   rushing in upon them.

   After this war against the Waldenses and the Albigenses, there was a
   cruel conflict carried on in various ways against different portions of
   their remains in different places, as well as against other associates
   of the same pure religion in every part of the world, until at length,
   notwithstanding all this, after the year 1500, whole kingdoms,
   principalities, and republics, with their reformed churches, seceded
   from the dominion of the beast to the party of the saints; against whom
   war was afterwards carried on, and continues to this day, nor will it
   finish until the beast shall come to an end.

   Now if any one would diligently measure in his mind the whole series of
   this butchery, comprehended in little more than 450 years, and would
   refer the number of the slain to calculation, I am either deceived, or
   it will appear marvellous, that the persecution of the beast not only
   equalled, but surpassed the ten heathen persecutions.

   We just now observed, that the number of the Albigenses and Waldenses
   who were slain, was estimated at a million of men. From that time to
   the Reformation of the Church, no one has undertaken the calculation of
   those who were taken off, partly by the flames, partly by the sword,
   partly by other tortures, though the number is known not to have been
   small. From the origin of the Jesuits to the year 1480, that is, in
   little more than thirty years, Baldwin on Antichrist remarks, that
   nearly nine hundred thousand were destroyed. In Belgium alone, and that
   only by the hand of the executioner, the Duke of Alva, that cruel
   champion of the Roman see, boasted, that under his authority about
   thirty-six thousand souls, by his orders, had been taken off in a few
   years. Vergerius testifies, who well knew the fact, that the
   Inquisition, as they call it, of heretical depravity, in the space of
   hardly thirty years, made away with a hundred and fifty thousand
   Christians, by divers kinds of afflictions. Sanders confesses, that an
   infinite number of Lollards, and Sacramentarians, were delivered to the
   flames through the whole of Europe; who, however, he says, were not
   given up to slaughter by the pope and bishops, but by political
   magistrates. So, indeed, in consistency with the prophecy, the fact
   ought to be; for of the secular beast it is said, "that he made war
   with the saints, and overcame them;" and of the ten kings, c. xvii.
   that "they should carry on war with the Lamb, and the elect, and
   faithful;" but of the ecclesiastical beast, not indeed that he himself
   killed with the sword, "but caused that whoever would not worship the
   image of the beast, should (by that image) be killed with the sword,"
   as we shall see a little below. Then follows, "And power was given him
   over every tribe, and tongue, and nation."

   Now what was this power, but that of waging war with the saints? as if
   it would extend itself as widely as the Roman domain, for the subject
   of discourse is not perhaps of dominion, but of the amplitude of
   persecution. If any one prefer the other interpretation, the sense will
   be, that such was the authority of the beast, that no tribe, tongue,
   nor nation, resisted his impiety. But we must not understand this of
   individuals, (many of whom were found in every age who preserved their
   faith to the Lamb) but of whole tribes, tongues, and nations, that is,
   of the political governments of mankind. Of which it is very true, that
   none is to be found which the beast had not detained for many ages in
   servile obedience to his impiety; so that those who dwelt dispersed
   here and there, through the provinces of the beast, and were in reality
   Christians, constituted alone at that time the undefiled and virgin
   Church, as that which had, alas! no state, republic, principality, nor
   kingdom, of its confession of faith. But here it is to be kept in mind,
   that the form of the beast was that impiety which supplied the place of
   the dragon, in whose communion those many kingdoms of the Roman
   dominion, as we have observed, coalesced to form one beast. Those,
   therefore, who embraced this are said to yield to the power of the
   beast, as all tribes, languages, and nations, did.

   "And all they that dwell on the earth shall worship him, whose names
   are not written in the book of life of the Lamb, slain from the
   foundation of the world."

   Now, lest any one, fascinated by so universal and catholic an assent to
   the laws of the beast, should presume that it was done piously and
   rightly, and that the example of so many nations and people might be
   followed by them without danger, or even when broken down and
   debilitated by the cruelty of persecution, he might violate his faith
   given to the Lamb, and yield to the worship of the beast; the Holy
   Spirit denounces, in a declaration plainly to be feared, in what
   situation and number they are to be esteemed by God, who exhibit
   themselves as complying with this monster of impiety; that they are not
   to be considered as in the roll of the Lamb who was slain, but to
   perish eternally as exiles from the kingdom of God. To this formidable
   admonition is subjoined an apostrophe, in order to excite attention.
   "If any one," says he, "has ears to hear, let him hear." As if he said,
   O pious worshippers of Christ, incline your ears, and retain in your
   inmost souls what is now proclaimed beforehand of the very unhappy lot
   of those who follow the beast; and it is not a thing of small moment,
   but the hinge upon which your salvation turns. Those words, therefore,
   ought to be referred to what precedes, and not to what follows, in the
   same manner as it is clear, the same address is more than once to be
   referred in the epistles to the churches. Vide c. ii. v. ult. c. iii.
   v. 6. 13. 22.

   "If any one leadeth into captivity, he shall go into captivity; if any
   one killeth with the sword, he shall be killed with the sword."

   A consolatory reflection for the pious, against whom the beast, when
   they refused to obey him, proceeded with war, imprisonment, and the
   most inhuman punishments. The time will come, when God, the just
   avenger of his people, may demand retribution for so many butcheries,
   suchenormous cruelties, and may execute vengeance on the raging beast.

   And "here," says he, "is the patience and faith of the saints." That
   is, let not the saints, relying on this equity of the Divine Power, and
   on his justice in ordering human events, be disturbed at what they are
   about to suffer, or faint in their minds, but courageously contending
   against the beast, firmly and patiently wait for the vengeance which
   will certainly, and in an accumulated degree, proceed from God.

   Hitherto we have treated of the secular beast. Now the apostle proceeds
   to the description of the other beast seen by him, namely, the
   ecclesiastical beast, or rather the false prophet, who exercises the
   lieutenancy of the former beast, and of his blasphemies.

   Of the other Two-horned Beast, or False Prophet.

   The two-horned beast, or pseudo-prophet, is the Roman pontiff, with his
   clergy, having indeed two horns like the Lamb, of whose power of
   binding and loosing on the earth he boasts himself the vicar, but
   uttering idolatries and butcheries of the saints like a dragon. For
   this beast was the author and founder of that ten-horned beast, which
   supplied the place of the dragon in tyranny and blasphemies, under the
   mark of the Christian profession. Of whom, therefore, as he exercises
   the power in the office of hierarch, so likewise is he the pontiff of
   the same, no less than of his clergy, (with whom he privately
   constitutes the pseudo-prophetic beast,) he conducts himself as head
   and monarch, exhibiting that seventh and last head of the Roman
   commonwealth, in the city on seven hills; who, indeed, by signs and
   miracles, which it was given to him and his clergy to do, or pretend to
   do, by the thunder of excommunication, as of celestial vengeance,
   brought in by degrees the kings, lately risen in the Roman world, out
   of the dissipated empire of the Cæsars, to submit their necks
   unanimously to him and to the government of Rome, now otherwise
   subdued, so as to introduce an image of the ancient, and now demolished
   heathen empire. Which went on so favourably for him, that not only the
   Roman beast, wounded in his Caesarean head, evidently revived in that
   image, but the image itself likewise, at the nod of the false prophet,
   fell upon those who exclaimed against his appearance, and chastised
   them with the secular sword, as the false prophet did with the
   spiritual.

   "And I saw (says he) another beast ascending out of the earth, and it
   had two horns like a lamb, and it spake as a dragon."

   He saw another beast, namely, the pseudo-prophetical or
   pseudo-ecclesiastical beast, which consisted, as we have said, of the
   Roman pontiff with his clergy. For the pontiff alone, and by himself,
   though he may be called the false prophet, does not, however,
   constitute the beast, unless with the addition of his clergy, since the
   beast denotes an assembly of men, delighting, like an animal, in a
   certain order of its members, and not a single person. But he saw him
   ascending from the earth; that is, not like the former, risen from the
   sea, or the dominions of the world; that is, from a more noble kind of
   origin, but sprung from the lowest condition of human affairs; or
   rather, not born as the secular one, during a tumultuous conflict of
   armies and people contending with each other, but growing up quietly,
   and without noise, like herbs and plants springing from the earth. For
   the sea, though it signifies a conflux of people into one dominion,
   signifies also an army in war. "And it had two horns like a lamb," that
   is, the bipartite power of binding and loosing, delegated by Christ to
   Peter, and so far, indeed, similar to that of the Lamb, inasmuch as lie
   said, "As my Father sent me, so send I you." This power, in fact, the
   beast assumes, and says that he acts therein as the vicar of Christ,
   hut he speaks as a dragon; even as the red dragon, whom Michael had a
   little before overthrown, and expelled from the Roman empire; whilst in
   truth, like him, he patronizes the worship of deities and idols, by his
   authority, and, in a similar manner, causes the true and pure
   worshippers of the Lamb that was slain to be exterminated by
   persecution and butcheries. For "he exercises all the power of the
   first beast before him." The two-horned beast executes that delegated
   power of the dragon committed to the first beast, and consisting in
   idolatrous worship; as a hierarch, whose office it is to preside in
   offering sacrifices. "Before the beast, or in his sight," is the same
   as with him, or for his sake; as if one should say, this two-horned
   beast belongs to the ten-horned beast, for the purpose of sacrifice, so
   that it ought not to appear wonderful if he speaks as a dragon. For
   thus the lphny of the Hebrews; to which enopion, in the sight of or
   before answers, is sometimes equivalent to the dative of the person to
   whom something is given, or in whose favour it is done, as, instead of
   that which is said 1 Sam. ii. 18, "Samuel was worshipping before the
   Lord," it is in ch. iii. "worshipping the Lord." But the Roman pontiff,
   in an especial manner the head of the latter beast, exercises the
   supreme administration likewise of the former beast: "And causet4 the
   earth, and those that dwell therein, to worship the first beast, whose
   deadly wound was healed." That is, in general, whatever the first beast
   is, whatever obedience is offered by the nations to his impiety, is
   wholly to be referred to this hierarch as its parent, by whose
   exertion, in fact, it should come to pass, that the earth and its
   inhabitants should worship the first beast, which arose out of the sea,
   and whose deadly wound was healed. In what manner, and by what means
   and contrivances he effected this, he particularly explains in the
   sequel. "For (says he) he doth great wonders, so that he maketh fire to
   descend from heaven on the earth, in the sight of men."--"And he
   deceiveth those that dwell on the earth, by the miracles which it was
   given him to do, in the presence of the beast, saying to those that
   dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast which
   had the wound by the sword, and yet lived." For he doth, kai poiei, the
   Vau of the Hebrews; and, therefore, kai in Scripture is not only a
   conjunction copulative, but also disjunctive, rational, causal, or
   dinal, or explanatory, as the sense requires; and this it may be
   sufficient to observe once for all. The pseudo-prophetic, or pontifical
   beast, is the occasion of constituting for the nations that ten-horned
   beast, by which the power of the dragon revived. For he persuaded him,
   by the same signs and miracles, to agree with him in fabricating an
   image of the beast slain in its sixth head; which at length, being
   formed at his suggestion, that wound, received in its dragon state,
   appeared by the introduction of a new idolatry and tyranny, according
   to the similitude of the former, to be cured; and the beast who
   worshipped the dragon, to be renewed; for the Roman beast is the image
   of the last head of the beast slain in its sixth head. He said to the
   inhabitants of the earth, that they should make an image of the beast
   which had received the wound from a sword; that is, the image of him in
   the condition in which he was when he received the wound; "and he
   lived;" that is, thus at length the beast revived, or was restored. For
   those words do not refer to the description of the beast whose image
   was to be fabricated, as the words of the false prophet who was
   speaking; but they are those of the angel relating or exhibiting the
   consequence of that advice; namely, that in this manner the slain beast
   revived. As if he had spoken more fully as follows: "Saying to the
   inhabitants of the earth, that they should make an image to the beast
   which had the wound from a sword. They did so, and he revived." As 2
   Kings ch. xx. v. 7, Isaiah said, "Take a lump of figs;" and they took
   them and laid them on the ulcer, and he recovered, viz. Hezekiah, or
   the ulcer. Now this is what was said in the description of the secular
   beast, that the dragon delivered to him his forces, and great
   authority, and therefore his deadly wound was healed. That is, the
   dragon impressed the form of his worship and power on the beast of a
   different religion; whilst he substituted his angels or demons, not,
   indeed, as formerly, to he worshipped under those titles in which they
   proclaimed themselves enemies to Christ our Lord, but under the shelter
   of the Christian religion, in the names of saints and good
   angels,--and, shame on the blasphemy!--even of Christ himself. For he
   who worships idols, under whatever name he may invoke them, worships
   demons.

   Nay, that nothing might be wanting to the complete image of the beast
   that was slain, that is, of the dragon, what some of the emperors who
   worshipped the dragon had done before, the pontiff himself took care
   should be offered to him; even divine honours, and an authority
   peculiar to God; so that "he sits in the temple of God," as St. Paul
   says, "exhibiting himself as God." Which though John, or the angel
   unfolding the history to him, does not here specially treat of, yet he
   means to have comprehended under the general name of an image, as a
   part of that similitude under which he is compared to the slain beast.

   And thus far of the fabrication of the image; now we proceed to the
   wonders applied in favour of his party. "He doth great wonders, so that
   he even causes fire to descend from heaven on the earth." Not
   unwillingly here should I accede to the opinion of Graser, if it could
   by any means be confirmed from the writings of the Hebrews, that this
   assertion of drawing down fire from heaven is used as a proverbial
   hyperbole, to the exaggeration of that which preceded it, as if one had
   said, he does great wonders, nay, of such a kind and so great, that
   they appear to be not far removed from the miracles of Elias himself,
   by which he maintained the worship of the true God. For the Jews, says
   Graser, commonly attribute so much to that miracle of Elijah, that they
   use it proverbially for all stupendous facts, by which the dignity of
   God is elucidated. But whoever is not pleased with this exposition, let
   him follow the Complutensian reading confirmed likewise by other
   copies. "He does great wonders kai pur ina tatabaine, and that fire
   should descend from heaven on the earth;" and so, as the summary of
   those things which are afterwards more diffusively explained, may be
   proposed in these words; the sentence may be interpreted of a two-fold
   species of means, which the false prophet should employ, to induce the
   inhabitants of the Christian world to form anew the image of the beast,
   which was slain in his sixth head; that is, by the display of miracles,
   and by the thunder of excommunication, by one of which he seduced the
   minds of the nations into error, by the other he subdued the contumacy
   and pride of the disobedient. Now each of these, whichever way they are
   regarded, is treated of in the following words in order. Of the wonders
   in these words,--"And he seduces the inhabitants of the earth by the
   wonders which it was given him to perform, saying to the inhabitants of
   the earth, that they should make an image of the beast, which was
   wounded by the sword," and those which follow to ver. 16. Of
   excommunication in these words,--"He causeth all to receive a mark in
   their right hands, or in their foreheads, that no one might buy or
   sell, but he who had the mark, or name of the beast, or the number of
   his name."

   A mode of speaking by synecdoche, by which, from the interdiction of
   commerce with others, the censure of ecclesiastical anathema is
   intimated. Nor is that assimilated improperly to celestial fire or
   lightning; for what, I beseech you, is to devote any one to the eternal
   fire in the name of God, but to call down fire from heaven? especially
   since the punishment to proceed from God in the lake of fire and
   sulphur, or Asphaltites, in which Sodom and Gomorrha were burned by
   fire rained down, is more than once represented in this book. Nay, the
   apostle Peter speaks of that conflagration, 2 Pet. c. ii. v. 6, that
   "God had set it forth as an ensample to those who should hereafter live
   ungodly; that is, by an ellipsis of the former substantive, common in
   the Hebrew, an ensample of the punishment of those who should be
   ungodly hereafter. And Jude, here expressing more clearly the intention
   of Peter, says, "puros aioniou diken hupechein;" that is, "to bear the
   similitude or type of eternal fire." For so, in a sense similar to
   this, the collation of the words of the two apostles with each other,
   and the nature of the thing itself, will persuade an attentive reader,
   that the words of Jude ought to be interpreted. And on this occasion
   likewise, permit me to add, that it was a memorable and melancholy omen
   to the Jews, then rejected by God, which Josephus relates to have
   befallen them in the very beginning of that fatal war, the defeat
   sustained by them at the passage of Jordan from the country of Jericho;
   namely, while some were thrown into the river by the enemy, others not
   being able to bear up against their force, voluntarily leaped into it;
   so that the lake Asphaltites was filled with carcases rolled down by
   the descending flood; in which case, says he, the plague, though very
   great in itself, yet appeared still greater in its nature to the Jews.

   But to proceed to the event of the prophecy. As to the wonders, it is a
   notorious circumstance, that a universal idolatry has prevailed in the
   kingdom of the beast for about twelve ages, to the present time, as
   well as the primary species, consisting in the worship of dead saints,
   of relics, and angels, as the next in order, the worship of images, and
   afterwards that latest blasphemy of a god in bread, by a great
   assemblage of wonders, by supposed cures, and miraculous visions, by
   the coercion of demons in appearance only, and by other surprising
   effects of different kinds, was first recommended, as it were, to
   unhappy Christians, and afterwards enforced and confirmed. All which
   things, indeed, the two-horned beast, or Roman pontiff, with his
   pseudo-prophetic attendant, is said to have done; inasmuch as they
   either contrived them or approved them by their authority when
   contrived by others; or they obtruded what were really the operations
   and tricks of evil demons, for true and divine miracles, in order to
   seduce the Christian world. For this is the very thing which the
   apostle Paul predicted to the Thessalonians, "that the appearance of
   the man of sin should be according to the working of Satan, with all
   power, and signs, and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of
   unrighteousness."

   The examples of thunder, or the pontifical anathema, by which he
   maintained his authority in decreeing and commanding, are in truth so
   obvious to every one, that I may be wholly spared the labour of
   introducing them here from the annals of the Church. One I wish to
   notice as very remarkable, and which so nearly relates to the image of
   the fabrication of which we are treating, that it may alone be
   sufficient to establish the truth of this prophecy. In that controversy
   or war about images, which arose among the Greeks about the year 720,
   and which was agitated for 120 years with great fervour, and
   persecution of idolatry, it can hardly be described into what peril
   that image of the slain dragon, then rude and imperfect, and not having
   received the finishing hand of the artificer, was brought. Nor in that
   controversy, as is commonly supposed, was the worship of images alone,
   but also that of dead saints and relics strenuously opposed. Leo
   Isaurius (says Theophanes, Hist. Miscell. Lib. xxi. ch. 23) not only
   erred with the impious concerning the affectionate adoration of
   venerable images, but also concerning intercessions of the most chaste
   mother of God, and of all the saints, whose relics, likewise, that most
   wicked man abominated, like his teachers the Arabians, (that is, the
   Mahometans.) The same writer says of Constantine, whom, as a term of
   reproach, the patrons of idols called Copronymus, (same chapter,) "This
   most mischievous, unmannerly, savage man, &c. first departed from God,
   and his undefiled mother, and all the saints." So this paltry Greek
   idolater blasphemes the pious emperor. Again, Lib. xxii. c. 42, "He
   every where opposed the intercession of the holy virgin, and mother of
   God, and of all the saints, as useless, both in his writings, and
   unwritten declarations, through whom every favour flows down upon us,
   rejecting their holy relics, and rendering them hateful. If at any time
   he was told of any extraordinary thing to be applied to the health of
   souls and bodies, or according to custom to be honoured by those who
   live piously, he immediately threatened death against those who did
   thus, as acting impiously; or, at all events, proscription, exile,
   torments. And that scrap most acceptable to God, as it was accounted a
   kind of treasure to the possessors, was taken away to he rendered
   hateful from thenceforth." Let the reader see likewise, c. 54. So also
   in c. 48, "As often as any one who fell down, or was sick, uttered the
   usual outcry of Christians,--Help, mother of God or was apprehended
   keeping vigils, &c. he was condemned as an enemy to the emperor, and
   was denominated immemorable." Nay, still under Theophilus, the last of
   five emperors who contended against images, it appears that the worship
   of saints was opposed by that hymn of Theodorus, in which the
   Constantinopolitan Church was accustomed every year, (O sin and
   sorrow,) to cherish again the memory of idolatry, at length victorious.
   For there the eighth ode says, "The sacred relics of the saints, and
   their images, that savage Lezius, together with John, (who was
   patriarch of Constantinople under Theophilus,) those deserters of piety
   nu-piously asserted were on no account to be venerated." What, then,
   did the Roman pontiff do in this case? He succours the image of the
   beast, in the greatest danger of being broken, and when he cannot
   succeed by letters and threats, he has recourse to fulminating arts. He
   strikes Leo the Isaurian, the leader of the Iconoclastes, with an
   anathema; he absolves his subjects in Italy from the oath of obedience,
   and deprives him of the Exarchate of Ravenna, and the rest of his
   dominion, as far as he is able. By which act, as he gave courage to the
   idolatrous faction in the east, so he opportunely terrified the kings
   of the west, from attempting any thing of a similar kind. By the same
   thunder, the Lateran Synod of 280 bishops, under Alexander the Third,
   ordained that the Albigenses, and their defenders, and supporters,
   should be blasted, and actually did blast them. The same thunder
   likewise, the great Lateran Council decreed, should be called down on
   the temporal lords, who, when required and admonished by the Church to
   purge their territories of them, neglected to do it; that is, that they
   should be bound by their metropolitans, and other provincial bishops,
   under the bond of excommunication, and if they contemptuously neglected
   to discharge this duty, their vassals should be denounced by the Roman
   pontiff, absolved from their allegiance, and their lands given up to be
   occupied by Catholics."

   "And it was permitted him to give life to the image of the beast, that
   the image of the beast might both speak, and cause as many as would not
   worship the image of the beast to be killed."

   If the image had not been endued with a vital power, the slain beast
   would not have revived by its fabrication. For the dragon-worshipping
   beast, which it was to resemble, was not an inactive beast, but was
   accustomed to exert himself very strenuously, and to attack those who
   opposed his inclination. Of the same kind, therefore, must that image
   be, in which he afterwards revived. Hence it is said to be given to the
   false prophet, not only that he should entice the Christian people to
   make an image of the beast, but that he should bestow life on it, by
   which, and by edicts of a similar nature, he might order what was
   necessary for the maintenance of his dignity, and might punish those
   who were disobedient, and who refused to submit to his religious
   constitution, by the sword, or by a secular death. And indeed the whole
   power which the image has, as a secular idolatrous beast, of warring
   with the saints, he exercises only as delivered to him by the
   pseudo-prophetic beast. For the matter is so managed, that those whom
   the pseudo-prophetic beast has condemned for heresy, (as they call it)
   or for dishonouring the image, he gives at last to the secular beast
   the power of killing; of which he possesses none himself, but that
   dependent upon ecclesiastical judgment. And this is what they call
   delivering over to the secular power, every where to be met with in the
   histories of the bestial executions. The pseudo-prophetic beast,
   indeed, as he would wish it to appear, does not himself kill, but yet
   he delivers those condemned by his sentence to the secular power, as to
   an executioner, to be killed.

   "And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, and free and
   bond (that is, of whatever rank, state, and condition) to receive from
   him [56] a mark upon their right hand, or upon their foreheads. And
   that no one might buy or sell, but he that had the mark or the name of
   the beast, or the number of his name." What is meant by the
   interdiction of buying and selling, (to begin with the last in order,)
   I have just now shown, namely, to denote the papal excommunication,
   under which those who fall are excluded from the custom and commerce of
   citizens. So the canon of the Lateran Council under Alexander, of which
   mention was made a little above, issued against the Waldenses and
   Albigenses, prohibits expressly under an anathema, "That any one should
   presume to receive, or maintain them in their houses, or to carry on
   any business with them." And the Synod of Tours, in France, prohibits
   under a similar denunciation, "Where the followers of that heresy, (as
   they call it) were known, that any one should presume to grant them a
   place of refuge in their territory, or to afford them protection; but
   prescribes that no communication should be held with them in buying and
   selling."

   And what? Does not the false prophet here likewise speak like a dragon?
   For the dragon Diocletian published a similar edict. That no one should
   sell or supply any thing to the Christians, unless they had first
   offered incense to the gods, of which Beda thus sings in the Hymn of
   Justin Martyr:


   Non illis emendi quidquam

   Aut vendendi copia;

   Nec ipsam haurire aquam

   Dabatur licentia,

   Antequam thuriticarent

   Detestandis idolis.


   No power to buy or sell,

   Not even water from the well,

   Could wretched Christians have;

   Unless to idols dire,

   With frankincense and fire,

   They hateful glory gave.

   This synechdochical mode of speaking perhaps the Holy Spirit used, to
   intimate that the papal anathema, though it boast of an abscission from
   the internal and invisible communion of Christ, has not really any
   power beyond that of excluding the person from the internal and visible
   commerce with other citizens.

   Now, as to what is said of the mark or character. The mark of the beast
   is not properly any thing but the name; therefore it is called the mark
   or name of the beast, and in the following chapter, the mark of his
   name. Now there is an allusion here to the ancient custom, by which
   slaves were wont to be marked with the names of their masters, and
   soldiers with that of their general; (the former chiefly on the
   forehead, the latter on the hand;) therefore, in a like manner, the
   followers of the Lamb, in a subsequent chapter, who form a contrast to
   the attendants on the beast, are inscribed on the forehead with the
   names of the Lamb and the Father. In the same sense, .in both examples,
   to indicate to what lord each assembly belonged, and for whom it
   fought; that the former professed themselves the servants of the beast
   and his image, the latter of Christ and his Father.

   What relates to number, is to be understood rather as an appendix of
   the name or mark of the beast, than the mark itself; and, indeed, it is
   the number, not so strictly of the name of the beast, as of the beast
   itself, as it is also immediately after called. But it is only called
   the number of the name on this account, because it would be contained
   in the letters of the name of the beast, referring to numbers, God so
   disposing it. And yet it does not follow, because the number agrees so
   intimately with the name, that therefore the number of the beast is to
   be confounded with the name. For the method of opposition (or contrast)
   requires, that, as in the assembly of the Lamb, the character of the
   name is distinguished from the number of the assembly, so likewise it
   should be in the bestial assembly. Add, that the character of the name
   and the number are altogether of a different kind, I say, as to
   signification, if we direct our interpretation according to the analogy
   of other places. For the character of the name is one thing as to the
   Lord, to whom those who bear it devote themselves, and the number is
   another, which points out from what ancestry or origin those who are
   celebrated by it derive their race. As the number twelve, and that
   formed from the multiplication of twelve, exhibited as well in the
   virgin assembly as in the structure and dimensions of the New
   Jerusalem, is a symbol of its apostolical origin and character.

   But not to dwell longer on these generalities, let us see at length
   what is that name of the beast in which his number, also marked by the
   Holy Spirit, is contained. It is, in truth, what some suspected, while
   the Apocalypse had been recently written, that word so often repeated,
   Lateinos. For it was by this name [57] , after the division of the
   empire, and the ten kings had arisen in its provinces, and not before,
   that the Roman false prophet, with the rest of the inhabitants of the
   West, was called by way of distinction, and that by those to whom the
   Apocalypse was addressed,--the seven Churches of Asia. For the Greeks,
   and the rest of the Orientals, with whom, in the dilaceration of the
   empire, the name had remained, wished themselves only to be called
   Romans; but us, with our pontiff, and under him, his bishops, kings,
   and dynasties, by a kind of fatal instinct they called Latins. And this
   very name, with its letters cast up in the manner of the Greeks and
   Hebrews, completes the number noted by the Holy Spirit; but it is a
   mystical number;--by which is indicated of what lineage the beast is,
   and how falsely he boasts himself the successor of the apostolic choir,
   when he is really that of the dragon.

   "The number of the name of the beast is 666;" which, if you endeavour
   to deduce from the compounds of 12, the symbol of the apostolic race,
   you will labour in vain, for you will never from thence be enabled to
   make 666, by whatever mode you may multiply: But on the contrary, from
   the power of 6, which is the number of the red dragon, that is, the
   beast of the sixth head, you will do it very easily, since the whole
   may be made up from sixes, how great soever it may be of units, tens,
   and hundreds; as if the seed of the dragon had pervaded the whole body
   of this last beast, and all its limbs. "Here is wisdom," says the
   Spirit. "He who bath understanding, let him compute the number of the
   beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666."

   That this ought to be computed according to the mode which I have
   described, I seem to myself to collect from the analogy of the virgin
   company, whose number 144, in contradiction to that of the beast, is
   wholly apostolical, arising from 12 multiplied into itself. The rule of
   contraries is contrary. And there, indeed, the Holy Spirit has
   expressed both, as well as the name inscribed, as the number of the
   company inscribed, but here he has left the name to be conjectured from
   the number. To settle the matter in few words. To receive the mark of
   the name of the beast then, is to devote oneself to his power, and to
   confess his dominion; but to be of his number, is to embrace his
   impiety, derived from the dragon, namely, the Latin idolatry. Whence it
   will not perhaps be unworthy consideration, that though no one can
   receive the mark of the beast's name, or be subject to his power, but
   he must of necessity receive his number also, at the same time, that
   is, partake of his impiety; it is possible that a person may admit the
   number or impiety of the beast, but may reject his mark or name.

   This is what has taken place among the Greeks for a long time past,
   who, although they embrace the same form of impiety, engrafted from the
   dragon, or the Latin idolatry, and that originally confirmed among
   themselves, under the auspices of the Latin pontiff, in the second
   Council of Nice, who was labouring there likewise to erect the image of
   the slain dragon, yet they have refused now for 700 years to be subject
   to the Latin pontiff, or to bear his name, as before they seceded in
   consequence of a schism, they had been accustomed to do.

   Of the Virgin Assembly, or one hundred and forty-four thousand of the
   Sealed of the Lamb.

   The virgin assembly of the followers of the Lamb of Sion, and the same
   selected company of Israel, adopted from the Gentiles, of which mention
   was made at the beginning of the seventh seal, (for it is described by
   a double vision, as we there observed, in order to connect the prophecy
   of the seals with that of the little book) signifies the Church
   faithful to the Lamb, a virgin under Babylon, in the midst of a world
   of nominal Christians, who followed the beast; the kindred and
   undegenerate progeny of the twelve apostles, apostolically multiplied;
   as alone according to the example of the heavenly choir, instructed to
   celebrate the Lamb and the Father with an evangelical song, in a chaste
   and holy manner; which by a sad fatality, not one of the beast's party
   was able to learn. Yet a people not addicted to any one seat, as the
   people of the beast, but accompanying the Lamb wherever he went,
   warning finally the worshippers of the beast frequently and sharply of
   the duty of evangelical worship, and of the manifest severity of God
   against idolaters; and at length denouncing to all, if they would not
   perish eternally, to withdraw themselves as quickly as possible from
   all connexion with it. This is a summary of the vision. Let us now
   elucidate the text according to this rule.

   "And I looked, and lo, a Lamb stood upon mount Sion, and with him a
   hundred and forty-four thousand." From the number 144, or twelve times
   twelve thousand, it appears that the same assembly is here described as
   was sealed at the introduction of the seventh seal; viz. that
   legitimate and undegenerate offspring of the apostles, bearing this
   number twelve as a mark of its origin. Let the reader reconsider what
   we there remarked.

   Now, mount Sion was the throne of the kingdom of David, and the same as
   what is called the city of David, because he built it, when taken from
   the Jebusites, externally with new walls, and internally with a royal
   citadel, streets, and squares. Therefore here it is parabolically
   applied, and it will designate that place on the earth which Christ,
   having conquered the dragon, made the dwelling-place of his kingdom, or
   his Church, that is, the world denominated Christian. In this world the
   virgin Church has its mansion, and therein still preserves its faith
   and chastity undefiled, when the beast appeared to have contaminated,
   and trodden down all things, with his adulteries and slaughters, and to
   have left nothing sound and uninjured.

   "Having (the name of the Lamb and) his Father's name written on their
   foreheads."

   The name of the Lamb is improperly omitted from some copies, as the
   Vulgate, Primasius, Andrew, Aretas, the Complutensian edition, and the
   Syriac translator allow. That it was the true reading is not to be
   doubted, but that the subject itself requires it to be so read, will
   clearly appear in the progress of the interpretation. For here is an
   allusion (as we also noticed in the history of the beast) to the
   ancient custom, by which both the slaves of masters, and the soldiers
   of the emperor, were distinguished, being anciently inscribed with
   their name or mark; and the slaves, indeed, principally on their
   foreheads, (witness Rhodigian's Book, v. 33.) but the soldiers on their
   hands. Vegetius, lib. ii. 5, says, "The soldiers, inscribed with
   permanent marks on the skin, and inserted in the rolls, were accustomed
   to take an oath." But Ætius says, lib. viii. 12, "They call them
   brands, which are inscribed on the face, or some part of the body, as
   those of soldiers are on the hands. But of the inscription of soldiers,
   Lypsius will give us more ample information, lib. i. de Mil. Rom. dial.
   9. "Under the princes," says he, "they punctured with a sharp
   instrument youths just taken, and branded them on the skin." These were
   real stigmas, and impressed on the hands of soldiers. They were
   inscribed with the name of the emperor. Hence Augustin calls it the
   royal mark, and Chrysostom sphragida, the seal. This is to be derived
   from the circumstance, that anciently the name of the emperor used to
   be inscribed on the shields, spears, and standards, and in imitation of
   that on the skin; or else from sacred rites, for those whom they
   consecrated to God, or initiated, they branded with marks or stigmas."

   Now then to the point. They bear the name of the Lamb, and his Father,
   on their foreheads, who do not break the faith by which they gave
   themselves up to the Lamb, as their emperor and Lord, and to his Father
   in baptism, and who do not relapse to the worship and pomps of Satan,
   and his angels, which they had once abjured. For thus in ancient times,
   (in order to throw a greater light on what has been here said) was the
   form of renunciation in baptism couched in most Churches. "I renounce
   Satan and all his works, and his pomps, and all his worship." In many,
   and those, the most ancient liturgies, was added, "and his angels." In
   others, "and all his inventions, and all who are under him." In others,
   in the same sense, "and his world." All which things may be expressed
   readily in the apocalyptical sense,--"I renounce the dragon, and all
   his forces;" that is, as Cyril of Alexandria explains the form of
   baptism, "I bid farewell to the multitude of demons, and I reject all
   their pomp and worship."

   The Roman Church was here a little more terse than others: for in it
   there is mention made only of Satan, his pomps, and his works; where,
   under the name of Satan as chief, it understands his angels also; of
   pomps and works, the idolatrous worship, and all its apparatus.

   That the sacrament of baptism, by which we solemnly profess faith to
   the Lamb, and the Father, and by which we receive their name, and are
   called Christians, is the Lord's seal, the fathers every where declare,
   and that from the highest antiquity of the Church. Hence that of
   Origen, "We bear the immortal laver on our foreheads; when the demons
   see it they tremble." Augustine also calls it, "the royal mark, the
   mark of the Emperor, the mark of the Redeemer." They also maintain that
   this seal may be cancelled, and as it were, obliterated by idolatry and
   superstition. Tertullian on Spectacles, c. 4, treating of baptism under
   the name of a seal, says, "When, upon our entering into the water, we
   profess the Christian faith in the words of his law, we call God to
   witness by our declaration, that we have renounced the devil, and his
   pomps, and his angels. What will be the chief and principal instance in
   which the devil, and his pomps, and his angels, arc to be understood,
   but idolatry?" and c. 24, "Do we not abjure and break the seal in
   breaking his testimony?" Of the same kind also is that in the Book of
   Idolatry, c. 19, "There is no agreement between the sign of Christ, and
   the sign of the Devil." In like manner Augustine Tract. 7 on John, "He
   has lost the sign of Christ, he assumes the sign of the devil." Christ
   will not have such a communion. He will possess solely what he has
   purchased. With these Isidore agrees, Origin b. 18. c. 59. On the
   execration of spectacles, "He denies God, who undertakes such things,
   and has become a prevaricator to the Christian faith, who desires that
   afterwards, which he renounced long ago, at his baptism, that is, the
   devil, his pomps, and his works. All therefore who have received the
   mark of the beast, have denied, abjured, rendered of no avail, and
   accounted, as if they had never received, the mark of Christ, and of
   the Father. Only those, a hundred and forty-four thousand, who had not
   gone over to the camp of the beast, but adhered firmly to the Lamb,
   show the Lord's mark on their foreheads.

   One thing still remains to be noticed; viz. that though the sealed in
   both instances, namely, here as well as in c. vii. are the. same, yet
   the reason for the sealing is not the same in both; and that in
   consequence of the different intent of the sealing. For there the
   subject of protection is treated of; here, of service and fidelity. But
   there is no necessity on that account to seek any other sign absolutely
   different from that of baptism; for baptism answers to both, since,
   over and above that which is the sign of our profession, God superadds
   another, namely, that of his grace, by which he acknowledges those who
   are washed, as his own, and receives them into his protection.

   The latter, then, is treated of in the first vision of the sealed ones,
   the former in the present, if I am not deceived. And it favours this
   construction, that Clemens Alexandrinus, according to Eusebius, lib.
   iii. c. 17, calls baptism teleion phulakterion, perfect guardianship.
   Also that Nazianzen, Orat. on Holy Baptism, affirms, that it is called
   a seal, as sunteresin, because it is conservation. Lastly, that of
   Basil, Exhort. to Baptism, "Unless the face of the Lord be sealed upon
   thee, unless the angel acknowledges the mark upon thee, how shall he
   fight for thee, or defend thee from thine enemies?" Now let us proceed
   to what follows.

   "And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as
   the voice of great thunder, and I heard the voice of harpers harping on
   their harps. And they were singing as it were a new song before the
   throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders," &c. This
   indicates the voice and song of the heavenly angels, glorifying the
   Father, and the Lamb, as they are reported to have done, when first the
   Lamb took the book of fates to be unclosed. With regard to these
   angels, therefore, he says by and by in the 5th verse, "And I saw
   another angel flying in the midst of heaven;" that is, a different one
   from those precentors. For there is no mention made of an angel before
   this, unless we call those who sung together a chorus of angels. Now
   the voice like the sound of many waters, and of thunder, signifies
   nothing but the voice of a numerous and crowded multitude, of which
   kind was that frequently heard in the temple, while it was still
   flourishing, of the Levite choristers, sounding forth the praises of
   God with the voice, and with musical instruments, on account of the
   multitude of whom, and of the people joining with them, a sound was
   produced resembling the waves of the sea, and the noise of thunder.
   This is not conjecture, but a plain matter of fact, as is directly
   expressed in the Song of Victory, c. xix. where the metaphor is the
   same. "I heard, as it were, the voice of a vast multitude, and as the
   voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunders, saying,
   Hallelujah!" Hence, in Ezek. c. xliii. v. 2, where it is simply in the
   Hebrew, "His voice, (that is, the voice of the glory of the God of
   Israel) was like the voice of many waters;" the Septuagint render it by
   a paraphrase, Phone tes paremboles, hos phone diplaion ton pollon, "The
   voice of his camp, as the voice of many redoubling the sound." The
   Chaldee has it in like manner, "The voice of those who bless his name,
   as the voice of many waters." And that passage from the same prophet,
   respecting the cherubim, c. i. v. 24, "I heard," says he, "the noise of
   their wings, like the noise of many waters, as the voice of the
   Almighty, the voice of speech as the voice of a host." Lastly, in this
   acceptation is what is said in the description of the person of the Son
   of God in the beginning of the Apocalypse, taken from Daniel; for what,
   according to Daniel, is "the voice of a multitude," is substituted by
   St. John "the voice of many waters;" what Daniel has, "His feet were
   like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words as the
   voice of a multitude," John expresses, "His feet were like fine brass,
   as if glowing in a furnace, and his voice as the sound of many waters."

   Moreover, the song is new which is sung to God, after the appearance of
   Christ in the world, in which, to Him that sitteth on the throne, and
   to the Lamb together, and to them alone, redemption, and power, and
   riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing,
   are religiously and evangelically offered. The formula of this song is
   to be found, c. v. v. 12, 13, and that under the title of a new song.
   So that it is scarcely to be doubted but that reference is made to it
   here, since mention is no where else made of a new song in this book.
   "Worthy," say they, "is the Lamb that was slain;" that is, as it is
   before a little more explicitly said by the elders and living
   creatures, because he was slain, "to receive power, and riches, and
   wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing." "To Him,
   therefore, that sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb, be blessing,
   and honour, and glory, and strength, for ever and ever.--Amen." This is
   the formula of the new song, which, if God should ever enable me more
   thoroughly to understand, I shall, perhaps, more diffusively detail by
   an explanation; for it is deeply imprinted on my mind, that the whole
   mystery of the evangelical worship is therein contained.

   As to the reason of the term applied to it, it seems to be called new,
   either as different and distinguished from that which was sung before
   the mission of Christ, (for under this, according to the saying of the
   apostle, "Old things are passed away, behold all things are become
   new,") or, for the new benefit resulting from his advent, granted to
   none of the former ages of the world, but only to the last times; for
   which benefit, God was from thenceforth to be glorified, as well by
   angels as by men. And this reason for the expression will be confirmed
   both by that passage of Isaiah, c. xlii. vv. 9, 10, "New things do I
   declare--Sing unto the Lord a new. song," and that appellation which
   occurs so often in the Psalms, of a new song, not to be understood, as
   it appears, in any other sense than either such a one by which the
   Divine power is celebrated for some new blessing, especially that of
   deliverance; (as in Psalm xl. "He brought me out of the miry clay; and
   He hath put a new song into my mouth;") or, at least, one which is sung
   according to the manner of such songs, with no common joy and delight.
   That either of which would agree with the evangelical hymn is so plain,
   that there is no reason why I should endeavour to prove it.

   "And no one could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four
   thousand, who were redeemed from the earth." In the whole Christian
   world, as long as the beast was possessed of power, no one knew how to
   sing the song of angels, except those who were of the number of that
   141,000 attendants of the Lamb. Since these alone, without any spot of
   idolatry, glorify the Father and the Lamb on earth, as the blessed
   angels in heaven, and they do that very thing which the Church in the
   Lord's Prayer incessantly asks of the Father that it may be done by
   all: "May thy will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth." The idea,
   therefore, or perfect example, of worshipping the Divine Power lawfully
   and duly, cannot be sought from any other source than from the
   celestial inhabitants.--"These are they who have not been defiled with
   women, for they are virgins." That is, who have not associated with
   immodest women, or harlots. But who are these women? Certainly not
   those who are commonly so called, but in the language of the prophets,
   states, and those indeed nominally Christian, but devoted. to idols, of
   which the queen is Babylon the Great, called the Mother of Harlots,
   with whom the kings and inhabitants of the earth commit fornication.
   With such, those who are of the company of the Lamb have not consorted;
   that is, they have not contaminated themselves with idolatrous incest.
   "For they are virgins;" that is, free from all stain of idolatry. For
   the mode of analogy fully requires that these should be called virgins
   in the same sense in which the others, whether kings or people, are
   said to commit fornication with Babylon. Besides, since Babylon herself
   is spoken of as the mother of harlots, it follows that her daughters,
   the other states, must likewise be young harlots, with whom the
   inhabitants subject to them are polluted by spiritual fornication.

   "These are they that follow the Lamb wheresoever he goeth." That is,
   most faithfully adhere to him, and do not desert him on any occasion;
   the metaphor being taken from those who never recede from a person's
   side, but accompany him in every place. Or thus: In whatever city,
   region, or territory, the Lamb has pitched his tent, there they attend
   upon Him; not like the rest of those who are called Christians, but
   will not seek for and follow the Lamb any where, unless he dwell at
   Rome, in the seat of St. Peter. "These were redeemed from among men,
   being the first-fruits unto God and the Lamb." That is, they were
   redeemed from the remaining profane crowd, that they might become a
   sacred property to God and the Lamb, like the first-fruits. For the
   Ap9ar9che, or Primitiæ, do not, as is commonly. believed, denote merely
   the first-fruits, but also, whatever in general is consecrated to God,
   as exempt from profane uses; for that expression in the Hebrew is
   trvmh, under which name the Scripture comprehends, as well tithes, as
   whatever were the object of oblations, except burnt offerings. Whence
   Chrysostom calls the tithes which Abraham paid to Melchisedeck,
   first-fruits. And Irenæus also contends that the first-fruits, which he
   asserts that God even still requires of his creatures for himself in
   his Church, ought not to be less than a tenth, since Christ says he did
   not abolish the natural precepts of the Law, but extended them; and, in
   truth, Christians have not an inferior, but a greater hope than the
   Jews. (Iren. adv. Heres. lib. iv. c. 27 and 34, juxta Feverardent. ed.)
   Why, even Callimachus, in his Hymn on Delos, calls the tenths,
   accustomed to be sent to Apollo, aparchas dekatephorous, first-fruits
   producing tithes. From all which circumstances it appears, that the
   word aparche, not only denotes an oblation of first productions, which
   in Hebrew is r'syt or bbvrym but also any other; and the reason of the
   name arises from this, that his own portion was to be given to God,
   before any thing was consumed for own purposes. Moreover, since the
   word does not include the definition of what part of the first-fruits
   was to be given, it came to pass that the ancient Christians chose to
   call their productions of the earth, or oblations of fruits, (though
   they thought they ought not to be less than the tenth part,) aparchas,
   or first-fruits, rather than tenths, as a voluntary, not a forced
   donation.

   These observations, though not much conducing to my object, I
   nevertheless wished to introduce, that I might make it palateable, if
   possible, to those among us, who sometimes employ themselves in
   searching out the antiquity and right of tithes in the Christian
   Church, from the Fathers and the Councils. In the mean time, (to return
   to the subject from which I have made a little digression,) it must be
   confessed, that the more strict signification of first-fruits is not
   ill-suited to the place before us,--namely, that the virgin company may
   be called the first-fruits in respect to the multitude of palm-bearers
   who are afterwards to receive him in a much larger number. Let the
   reader's judgment be free.

   "And in their mouth was found no guile," (pseudos, mendacium, lie: So
   the Vulgate, Syriac, Complutensian, Aretas, and Andrew in the Palatine
   copy; in others dolos;) "for they are blameless."

   "There is found no lie." Of the kind of which there is found in the
   mouth of the beast's company, and of all idolaters, who profess that
   they worship the Lamb and the Father, yet really bestow the honour due
   to the Divine power on created things. For in truth, all idolatry is
   lying, since it worships for God what is not God. To which refers that
   passage of the apostle to the Romans, ch. i. 25, "They have changed the
   truth of God into a lie, and served the creature instead of the
   Creator," para ton ktisanta. Whence idols are called lies, as Amos ch.
   ii. v. 4, "Their lies (idols in the Vulgate) have caused them to err,
   after which their fathers walked." In the same manner, Isaiah ch.
   xxviii. v. 15, "We have made lies our refuge." So also Jerem. ch. xvi.
   v. 19, 20, "The Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the
   earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, (Chaldee,
   phlchv have worshipped vanity); and things wherein there is no profit.
   "Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?" Hence, too,
   the Apocalypse, ch. xxi. v. 8, "Idolaters and liars;" and also ver. 27,
   "that worketh abomination and maketh a lie," seem to be placed on a
   level, or as synonymes. Moreover, since the idolatry of men of any
   description is a lie, then truly that of those, who at the same time
   pretend that they are the worshippers of the true Deity, is most
   properly deceit, or a fraudulent lie; so that if we attend to the
   hypocrisy of those followers of the beast, in opposition to whom the
   company of the sealed attendants of the Lamb is described, the reading
   which has "guile," will appear preferable to the other, which has "a
   lie;" though it makes no great difference in the matter itself. In the
   mean time, for a fuller explanation of this pas. sage, let the reader
   compare that of Zephaniah iii. 13, which is indeed very similar to it.
   "The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither
   shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth."

   "And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven (en
   mesouranemati), having the everlasting Gospel to preach to those who
   dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and
   people."

   The description of the assembly being finished, the history of events
   in that state of the Church follows, which were to be transacted, as
   well by the assembly under the auspices of the Lamb, their leader, as
   by the Lamb himself, against revolters and rebels. Of those events the
   order is double. First, of a three-fold admonition to the followers of
   the beast, exhibited as the shout of so many angels; secondly, of
   judgments in the Parable of the Harvest and Vintage. The first of the
   admonitory angels is he who is called another; but another, as I
   observed with reference to the chorus of angels, a little before
   described, in the number of whom that evangelist was not included. And
   here it must be remembered, (what I have already noticed above,) that
   the angels, in visions of this kind, represent the rule of those over
   whose government they preside; and what is transacted by the joint
   operations of both, is said to be done by the authority of angels, as
   the leaders or directors of the action. Hence, therefore, there is room
   to suppose, that the flying so sublimely, (provided that also ought to
   be considered as within the purview of the parable) is the president,
   not of every rank of men, but of those of a higher condition, and of
   such men lie is about to make use in publishing the Gospel. Besides,
   that Gospel is called aionion, or eternal, and that, I think, not so
   much with respect to the future as the past, as that which was
   promised, ap' aionos, that is, from the foundation of the age, or the
   beginning of the world, namely, "that the seed of the woman should
   hereafter bruise the serpent's head;" that is, by the coming of Christ,
   the kingdom of the devil should be destroyed, and the kingdom of God
   established. In which sense also, the apostle says, that it was
   "promised by God, pro chronon aionion, before the world began," Titus,
   ch. i. v. 2. So then aionion will be here the same as ap' aionos, and
   the everlasting Gospel mean the same as in the Hebrew, any vsrh slm the
   ancient Gospel, as eremoi aionioi, Isa. ch. lviii. triboi aionioi, Jer.
   ch. vi. v. 16, and Bounoi aennaoi, Deut. ch. xxxiii. v. 15, are
   rendered, the "old waste places, the old paths, and the ancient
   mountains."

   "Saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to him, for the hour
   of his judgment is come, and worship him who made heaven and earth, and
   the sea, and the fountains of waters."

   The first angel, announcing that the time of the kingdom of God was now
   at hand, in which his judgment would be exercised on idols and
   idolaters, and therefore it began to be exercised as soon as the demons
   were thrown down, and cast out from the Roman throne; on which account
   he exhorts the nations, and tribes, and tongues, and people, who had
   from that time submitted to the power of Christ, that mindful of what
   they had done, they should worship the one only true God, the Creator,
   as it is announced in the Gospel,--and keep themselves from idols.
   "Fear God," says he; that is, reverence him, and give him the
   glory,--the glory of adoration and religious worship, as is explained
   in the following words: "For the time of his judgment is come;" that
   is, the time when Christ by his cross spoiled principalities and
   powers, and announced, by his apostles and evangelists, to the nations
   whom he had suffered so long to walk in their own ways, that they must
   be converted from idols, or otherwise they would be punished with
   eternal death, at his return from heaven. Why, then, did Christians,
   who profess their faith in Jesus Christ, this judge and conqueror of
   demons, return again to the worship of idols and demons?

   It is perhaps possible, that the time of judgment might be understood
   more strictly of the judgment of God, some time before displayed
   against the dragon and his followers, by which Paganism fell; but I
   would rather extend it more widely, and take it universally of the
   kingdom of Christ begun and promulgated in the last times, in which
   idols are no longer to be endured; namely, according to that saying of
   our Saviour, in the Gospel by St. John, ch. xii. v. 31,--"Now is the
   judgment of this world, now shall the prince of this world be cast
   out." See also ch. xvi. v. 11. From which judgment, indeed, the apostle
   Paul also (in the same manner as the angel here) drew an argument for
   dissuading the Athenian pagans from the worship of idols, Acts, ch.
   xvii. v. 30, 31, "The times of this ignorance God overlooked, but now
   commandeth all men every where to repent, because he hath appointed a
   day in which he will judge the world in righteousness, by that man whom
   he hath ordained; having given assurance thereof to all men, in that he
   hath raised him from the dead." Similar to which is his admonition to
   the Lycaonians, ch. xiv. 15, "We preach unto you, that ye should turn
   from these vanities to the living God, who made heaven and earth, and
   the sea, and all things therein; who, in the generations that are
   passed, suffered all nations to walk in their own ways;" that is,
   before his judgment was manifested to them. We must supply: But now he
   promulgates his judgment to all; which the angel here expresses by
   saying, "The time of his judgment is come." But when? you will ask; and
   where, and with what ministers, did this angel perform his preaching?
   Certain preludes were issued as soon as superstition began to attach
   itself to the memories, and to hang round the relics of the martyrs in
   the Church, as appears by the history of Vigilantius, with whom, when
   opposing a superstition of this kind, many others, even some of the
   bishops of that time, agreed, as his adversary Jerome witnesses, who
   improperly attacks him on that account.

   But this preaching most manifestly appears to have been fulfilled from
   the year of our Lord 720, in the Greek and Oriental Churches, where the
   evangelical angel indeed was flying, en mesouranemati, in the midst of
   heaven, that is, in a lofty and sublime place; for he employed one who
   was of the administrators of the Gospel, not a man of low and vulgar
   rank, but of the highest powers in the Christian world; for instance,
   the Constantinopolitan emperors, Leo Isauricus, Constantine
   Iconomachus, Leo the Arminian, Michael Balbus, and Theophilus; who all,
   but especially the first, protested most strenuously by their edicts
   and decrees in favour of a religious worship addressed to God alone,
   the Creator, in contradiction to the worship of the creature, not only
   that which was exercised in the veneration of images, but in reference
   to the saints, and their relics. Let the reader look back to the
   testimonies which I quoted upon this subject from Theopanes, when 1 was
   treating of the two-horned beast. But besides this, under the auspices
   of the second emperor, a council of bishops was convoked at
   Constantinople, in 338, and the adoration of images was charged with
   impiety, and condemned. You will acknowledge, Reader, if you are not
   tired of referring to it, that the very declaration of the Synod is the
   address of the angel, and grounded on the same foundation as his,
   according to our interpretation. But since it happened there, by the
   fraud of some who had indeed assented with the rest to the condemnation
   of images, yet favoured the invocation of saints, (for the votes were
   not equal against the latter and former superstitions,) that two
   canons, one relative to the worship of the blessed Mary, the mother of
   God, the other to the addressing the rest of the heavenly saints with
   religious invocation, were intermixed in the beginning with the decrees
   of the Council. As soon as the Emperor Constantine, with the Fathers of
   the sounder opinion, had remarked them, they immediately adjudged them
   to be erroneous, and took care, in testimony of their judgment, that
   they should be cancelled, and blotted out of the book. Of this fact I
   have a witness, if any one should doubt it; in the first place, the
   author of the refutation of that Constantinopolitan declaration,
   inserted in the Acts of the second Council of Nice; which, while it
   assumed that the first publication of it refuted itself, thus refers to
   those canons: "After this their publication," says he, "they rejected
   even the offer of intercessions acceptable to God, blotting it out from
   this their rescript." Then the acts of Stephen the monk and
   pseudo-martyr, according to whom, when the bishops, who were sent by
   the emperor to convince him, began to recite the decree of the Council,
   he immediately proceeded to object to the title of the Council as Holy,
   that it ought not to be called holy which proscribed holy things. "Have
   you not," says he, "torn in pieces the sacred shrine adorned with
   images? Have you not discarded this adjective Agios, Saint, from all
   the just, from all apostles, from prophets, from martyrs, and pious
   men? For it is established by you, O generous men! that when any one
   should approach one of these persons, and he should be asked by him
   whither he was going, he should answer, To the apostles, to the forty
   martyrs; or, whence he came, From the temple of the martyr Theodorus,
   from the temple of the martyr George. Are not these your doctrines?
   With what consistency then have you, who have proscribed holy things,
   convened a holy council?" These are the words of Stephen himself. Let
   us hear besides the describer of his acts (who lived at the same time),
   tragically exclaiming against the same persons, for undervaluing the
   worship of the mother of God. "To what a degree, O Christ, do I admire
   thy lenity, which cannot be expressed in words! In what manner may I
   explain the depth of your benignity, which surpasses all the power of
   words! Still do those audacious tongues continue to burst forth in such
   a manner, that they do not hesitate to utter that great and wicked
   saying, namely, that the virgin mother of God herself is a being of no
   utility after death, and destitute of all advantage, and cannot be an
   aid, or a patroness to any one." I add to these the testimony of
   Cedrenus. He relates, that Constantine issued an universal law,
   (without doubt, from the opinion of a council, whose Acts are not
   extant at this day, except the declaration only) "That no one whatever
   of the servants of the Lord should be called Saint, but that their
   relics when found should be despised, (that they might not be
   superstitiously venerated, O Cedrenus, even though they were real; and
   if false, be cast out of the temple;) nor their intercession invoked,
   for it was of no value." "The wretch added," says he, "that no one
   should implore the intercession of Mary."

   Now the reader may agree with me, whether he does not think it clear
   from these testimonies, that there was something transacted in that
   council against the worship of saints and relics. I have dwelt so much
   the longer on the proof of this, because it is not so well known to
   every one as that against images. But we have not yet discharged our
   duty; that calumny about the epithet of Saint being denied to the just,
   as if in degradation and contumely, must first be wiped away. For it is
   evident from the declaration of the Synod, (which is extant at this
   clay in the Acts of the second Nicene Council) that the apostles and
   the just are every where honoured by those fathers with the title of
   sanctity. They are not therefore to be supposed to have absolutely
   prohibited that which they themselves have often done. But we may be
   allowed to conjecture, that, in the opinion of that age, the word
   hagios (for of this word only are we disputing,) appeared to infer the
   honour of intercession; and therefore, that superstition might by all
   means be opposed, the use of it in common discourse about the temples,
   especially when they went there to pray, was interdicted. For hagios
   seems to he derived from hagos, by which word is signified veneration,
   or a being worthy of veneration. Whence are hagioi, sebasmioi, and both
   from hazo, to venerate, to worship. Nay, that it manifestly refers to
   the worship of the dead, it is of common origin with enagizein, to
   offer sacrifices to the dead, to perform funeral rites to deceased
   relatives; and with enagismos, the performance of such rites,
   sacrifices to the dead. Besides, (with the reader's good leave, and
   without a charge of trifling annotation,) it might be the case, that
   the word hagios, among the Greeks, (as the examples of similar blunders
   on the part of the vulgar may sometimes be observed among us,) might
   seem to imply, though falsely, by whom our prayers are offered to God;
   that is, prosagogia, an usher and mediator with God; in the same manner
   as Gregory Nazianzen gives the title to our Lord Christ, according to
   the apostle to the Ephesians, c. ii. v. 18. Di autou echomen prosagogen
   pros ton Patera. "Through him we have access to the Father." However it
   may be, it appears by the testimonies adduced, it was at the time
   supposed, that by the use of this word the superstitious feeling
   towards the saints who had departed this life, was supported and
   cherished. To resist which, by every means and effort, its use was
   interdicted, not, indeed, absolutely and universally, as their
   adversaries calumniously represent, but in giving that title to the
   temples only, which were named in memory of the apostles and martyrs.

   This was done, as it appears, to do away the error of supposing, that
   either the places themselves, where God was approached through the
   intercession of martyrs, or of those whose names they bore, were
   entitled to veneration. Therefore, instead of the name of Saints, they
   thought fit to substitute that of apostles and martyrs, certainly not
   less honourable. It was indeed the province of him to judge on this
   subject considerately and advisedly, who had all the circumstances of
   the time, and the facts of the case, before him, openly and fully
   displayed. In the mean time, it does not detract at all from the
   virginity and purity of the Church, if she has sometimes judged with
   less wisdom in such cases as refer to the reason and mode of performing
   any act. It does not necessarily follow, that she who is chaste should
   always act or speak prudently. From nearly a similar cause, the word
   sacerdos, priest, as applied to evangelical presbyters; and
   sacrificium, a sacrifice, as applied to the sacrament of the eucharist;
   (not to name other words of this kind,) were ordered to be disused
   among many of the reformed churches. And that indeed not altogether
   rashly, if they had not substituted (in the opinion of some,) the word
   ministri, ministers, not a very appropriate term; by which all who
   discharge the sacred office are properly called according to the use of
   Scripture, but by which, however, priests are not distinguished from
   deacons. Should we not rather have called them by the apostolical name
   of presbyteri, presbyters, if we dislike sacerdoti, priests? But these
   are matters which belong to another place.

   Moreover, not only in the East, but in the West also, though the Roman
   pontiff was enraged, the proclamation of this angel resounded, not
   indeed, as there, with the full blast of the trumpet, but still with a
   public and solemn denunciation. First in the year 790, in the Synod of
   Frankfort, under Charlemagne, composed of nearly 300 bishops, besides
   abbots, and others; where the worship and adoration of images were
   condemned, together with the second Nicene Council, which had
   established them, and which Pope Hadrian had by his legates managed and
   approved. And again in the Synod of Paris, in the year 825, assembled
   by the command of Louis, in which it is shown at length, both from
   Divine authority and from the opinions of the Fathers, that the
   adoration of images was a wicked and impious practice, and the Nicene
   Synod was reprobated, as guilty of this kind of superstition. Add to
   this, the commentary sent by Charlemagne to the pontiff Hadrian, the
   champion of idols, after the Frankfort Council; and here likewise you
   may acknowledge the angel flying in the midst of heaven. Hitherto we
   have attended to the exhortation of the first angel: now let us listen
   to the preaching of the second.

   The second angel denounces Rome for its filthiness, and the multitude
   of its idolatries; by which, in despite of the exhortations of the
   first angel, she had not only contaminated herself, but also had
   exhibited herself as the leader and chief of all the nations of the
   world, that they with her might do the same, and by which she was now
   converted from the city of God into Babylon; on this account become at
   length wholly obnoxious through her impenitence to the Divine sentence
   delivered against all idolaters, as no longer to be endured, but to be
   destroyed, and cut off by an irrevocable decree; and the preparation
   for that ruin was ordained to be continually and assiduously prosecuted
   from this proclamation.

   And the assembly of the Waldenses and Albigenses were the attendants of
   this proclamation, partly in word, and partly in deed, as those who
   first of all mortal beings openly denounced the Roman Church for its
   idolatry, or mystic whoredom, to be the apocalyptical Babylon; and they
   likewise took the first step towards its ruin; since thus detected,
   immediately a great multitude of men began to abominate her, and
   privately to make a defection throughout all the provinces of her
   dominion; and, in addition, her authority from thenceforth, day by day,
   began to fall more and more into decay, and her ruin then to commence,
   which was not to stand still, till it should at length come down to the
   burning of the city. I will say in a word, from the preaching of this
   angel, a select force of holy soldiers began to be formed for the
   uninterrupted destruction of Babylon.

   "Babylon has fallen. It has fallen." As if he had said, Now are the
   foundations laid for the ruin of Babylon; from this time shall the
   preparations for waging war against her be undertaken. It is an
   imitation of Isaiah, c. xxi. who expressly, in the same words, and on
   an occasion not different in kind, related the ruin of the ancient
   Babylon, not yet accomplished, but pre-announced, as here by the
   foundations being laid, it should most surely come to pass. For as
   chronology teaches, Isaiah uttered his prophecy at the very time when
   the Medes, who were hereafter to lay waste Babylon, having shaken off
   the yoke of the Assyrians, asserted their own liberty; and having built
   Ecbatana, under their new king, Dejoces, laid the foundations of that
   kingdom, which was to be fatal both to Nineveh .and Babylon.

   "Because she made all nations drink of the wine of the excess of her
   fornication."

   That is to say, she has deceived them with philtres, with medicated
   wine; thumos here does not mean wrath or violent anger, but according
   to the Hellenistic use of the word, poison [58] ; for they conceive it
   to be synonymous with the Hebrew chmh, which signifies sometimes wrath,
   sometimes poison. Hence, Deut. c. xxxii. v. 33. Sept. "Thumos drakonton
   ho oinos auton, kai thumos aspidon aniatos." "Their wine is the poison
   of dragons, and the incurable venom of asps." Also Job, c. xx. v. 16.
   "Thumon drakonton thelaseien, aneloi de auton glossa opheos;" that is,
   "he shall suck the poison of asps, the viper's tongue shall slay him."
   Add Psalm lviii. v. 4. "Thumos autois kata ten homoiosin tou opheos,"
   "Their poison is like the poison of a serpent." Vide also, if you will,
   Deut. c. xxxii. v. 24; Job, c. vi. v. 4. Nay, wherever the
   signification of poison occurs in the Old Testament, you will not see
   it expressed more than once in any other way than this, or by the word
   choles [59] . Now mention is twice made in the Apocalypse of oinos tou
   thumou, or poisoned wine of this kind; of oinos tou thumou tes
   porneias, the poisoned wine of fornication, in which, as I said, an
   amatory virus or philtre is meant, (according to which the same c.
   xviii. v. 23. pharmakeia, sorcery, a word suited to that meaning) and
   oinos tou thumou tes orges, the poisoned wine of indignation, which is
   the potion of those who undergo punishment; since by the former the
   Holy Spirit expressed the enticement to spiritual fornication from the
   custom of harlots conciliating love by philtres; by the latter, he
   alluded to the manner of the Jews, who were accustomed to offer to
   those who were to suffer death, a cup of wine, in which myrrh or some
   kind of aromatic bitter was mixed, for the purpose of bringing on a
   torpor. A potion of which kind, for this reason, is related to have
   been offered to our Saviour just after be had been affixed on the
   cross, but he refused to drink it. Matt. c. xxviii. v. 34. "They gave
   him wine mingled with gall," meta choles memigmenon, that is, wine of
   wrath, for chole and thumos mean the same. Now, by the word chole, the
   evangelist meant something bitter in general, according to the use of
   the Greeks, (by whom wormwood is also called chole). This St. Mark
   shows to have been myrrh, "And they gave him wine mingled with myrrh."
   But myrrh in Hebrew mvr, Syriac mvr', took its name from its excessive
   bitterness. And hence it seems to follow, that the prophets in
   depicting destructions, so often make use of the parable of the cup; as
   that which according to national custom it was usual to present to
   those who were about to die.

   Such was the proclamation of the second angel, whom the third soon
   succeeded. Whatever new admonition he superadds, let us listen to with
   submissive attention.

   The third angel, going beyond the two former, admonishes the
   worshippers of the beast how horrible a danger impended over them, if
   they still persisted in being his followers; and therefore persuades
   them, renouncing all delay, immediately to withdraw themselves from his
   society; that by this means they might consult their own safety, for
   those who adhered to him afterwards could not possibly be safe. Which
   preaching, indeed, being the most remarkable of all, was fulfilled in
   the labour of Luther, and his associates and successors; the
   consequence of which was the illustrious Reformation of the Churches,
   which we now behold, not by individual men, as was done at the voice of
   the preceding angel, but by provinces and tribes, to the assertion and
   purification of religion, every where shaking off the yoke of the
   beast. "And a third angel followed them (that is, the two former),
   saying with a loud voice, If any one worship the beast and his image,
   and receive the mark on his forehead, or on his hand, he also shall
   drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without
   mixture into the cup of his indignation, and he shall be tormented with
   fire and brimstone before the holy angels, and before the Lamb. And the
   smoke of their torment ascendeth for ever and ever, and they have no
   rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever
   receiveth the mark of his name."

   A terrible description of a terrible judgment, to which scarcely any
   thing similar occurs within the compass of the whole canon of
   Scripture. "The wine of the wrath of his indignation," is the potion of
   punishment accustomed to be given to those who are about to die, as we
   observed on ver. 8. Pure wine, that is, wine not diluted with water,
   strongly inebriates, and still more, if different kinds of wine are
   mingled together; of which kind, therefore, some would understand to be
   meant here, by those words kekerasmenou akratou, that is, mixed wine;
   since he would otherwise speak of things that oppose each other. But I
   am inclined to think, that akraton kekerasmenon may be the same with
   pure wine mixed with myrrh, gall, frankincense, or a similar drug of
   bitter flavour, which was used to be put into a cup, called by the Jews
   the cup of malediction, after the manner of the nation; and that there
   is an allusion to it in the lxxvth Psalm, v. 9. according to the
   Septuagint. "Poterion en cheiri Kuriou, oinou akratou pleres
   kerasmatos," "A cup in the hand of the Lord of pure wine full of
   mixture." When the Chaldee has, "There is a cup of malediction in the
   hand of the Lord, of strong wine full of a mixture of bitterness, so as
   to take away the use of reason from the wicked." For we said, that the
   potion was given to take away the use of reason from the dying person.
   But instead of what the Sept. has, pure wine, in the Hebrew it is
   yyvtmd, red wine, which had not lost its colour by admixture with
   water. For there: were red wines in the Holy Land. The remaining part
   of the description is obvious.

   It will be useful here, to observe the progress of this triple
   proclamation, and how the latter exceeds the former in importance. The
   first angel admonished only of one duty, that of worshipping God duly,
   according to the directions of the Gospel, and did not reprove the
   fault committed on this head. The second proceeding farther points at
   the crime of spiritual fornication, and that to be inevitably punished
   by death and destruction, but which it threatens at the time to Babylon
   alone, the chief leader and contriver of the crime, and not yet to the
   participators in it. But the third, the full measure of heinousness
   being fulfilled, denounces to the whole army of the beast, and to all
   who should continue in obedience to him, the most horrible and
   unspeakable torments, and that they would have neither end nor
   remission. Then follows, "Here is the patience of the saints, here are
   they who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." As if
   he should say, This preaching will be the touchstone, to prove both the
   patience and obedience of the saints. Their patience indeed, if,
   acquiescing in the expectation of so terrible a punishment, of such as
   will compensate for all delay, they should by no means be disturbed at
   the daily successes of the beast; nor fall away in their minds in any
   degree to him by the rage of persecutions, with which he will assail
   the refractory, and those who are disobedient to his command; their
   obedience, truly "to the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus,"
   if, after having heard this threat, they without delay forthwith
   withdraw themselves from communion with the beast, and renounce his
   image, and mark. These are they "who keep the commandments of God, and
   the faith of Jesus;" that is, who rightly and evangelically worship God
   in the faith of Jesus Christ, and on that account are called, not
   undeservedly, by the name of evangelical.

   The virgin church having thus discharged her triple admonition, the
   sanction of it succeeds against her enemies, under the type of the
   harvest and the vintage; which, when once finished, the blessed
   remuneration of the just is no longer delayed, as is proved by that
   denunciation from Heaven delivered before the description of both. "I
   heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead
   which die in the Lord from henceforth. Yea, saith the Spirit, that they
   may rest from their labours, and their works do follow them."

   I know that most refer this celestial declaration to former events, as
   for the purpose of consoling the saints, who are now about to suffer
   very grievous injuries from the beast, irritated by the preceding shout
   of exhortation. In which opinion I also concurred some time ago. But
   now, having weighed the matter more accurately, I incline to think,
   that it is to be referred rather to subsequent events, as an admonition
   of the near approaching resurrection and judgment under the seventh
   trumpet; the preparation for which would begin to take place in the
   following visions; so that the word aparti, from this time, may be used
   not in respect of the subject exhibited in the preceding vision, but of
   that to be exhibited in the following one, which, without doubt,
   immediately precedes the resurrection of the dead and judgment. As if
   he had said, Now we are come to that state of things, that only one
   thing remains to be fulfilled, before the time in which the dead in the
   Lord shall rise to a blessed life. For so in the Gospel of St. Matthew,
   c. xxiii. ver. the last, our Lord says to the Jews, "Ye shall not see
   me aparti, from thenceforth, until ye shall say, Blessed is he that
   cometh in the name of the Lord." That is, not from the moment of time
   in which he was speaking these words, but from the time of the
   Passover, which he was then about to celebrate; after which he no
   longer presented himself openly in the sight of the Jews. Now my reason
   for thinking this to be the case is threefold: First, that I do not
   remember any where in the sacred Scripture, that the day of death is
   pointed out as the day of recompense, but only the day of resurrection
   and judgment. Secondly, the denunciation from heaven, with a command to
   write, does not seem applicable, except to point out some remarkable
   turn of events. Undoubtedly a command of this kind is nowhere else to
   be found, except in the beginning of this entire prophecy. Lastly,
   there is an agreement in sense, if well-attended to, between this
   proclamation, and that at the sound of the seventh trumpet, ch. xi.,
   where the time is said to be come, when "the cause of the dead,"
   (namely, those who died for the sake of Christ) "should be judged, and
   God should give reward to his servants the prophets, and to the saints,
   and to those who fear his name, both small and great, and should
   destroy those who destroy the earth." So here, "Blessed are the dead
   from henceforth, who die in the Lord, that they may rest from their
   labours;" that is, they may henceforth lead a life secure from their
   ancient evils and calamities; (by which is intimated the extermination
   of enemies and tyrants;) "and their works do follow them;" that is,
   they shall obtain a most blessed reward for all their sufferings and
   all their good works.

   Meanwhile, if this interpretation is admitted, I alter not the sense of
   the words, "those that die in the Lord," by understanding those with
   the last words of the foregoing sentence, "not of any who sleep in the
   faith of Christ, but especially of the martyrs, who poured out their
   lives for Christ," (for to such belongs the first resurrection,) so
   that I think with Beza, it may be rendered, who die on account of the
   Lord, or for the Lord's sake. As in the Epistle to the Ephesians, c.
   iv. v. 1, "A prisoner in the Lord," is a prisoner for the sake of the
   Lord, the same indeed as "the prisoner of Christ," c. iii. v. 1.

   In which sense the ancients (as we may conjecture from Tertullian)
   understood 1 Thess. c. iv. v. 16, "The dead in Christ shall rise
   first;" that is, the martyrs, who were delivered up to death for
   confessing Christ. See Tert. de Animâ, c. lv. Moreover, it is to be
   noted, that the ablative in the Latin, and so likewise the dative in
   the Greek, which signifies in some places the instrument, and mode of
   acting, denotes also the cause for which, or on account of which, a
   thing is done. "He strikes in anger; he is impelled by envy," or the
   like. But since the Hebrews express this ablative or dative by the
   preposition v, and in imitation of them the Greek Scriptures express it
   by en, it follows from thence, that iv also signifies in the same
   place, the cause, on account of which a thing is done. Such a
   signification, indeed, with this particle, is not very frequent, but I
   have no doubt but diligent observation would supply more examples than
   occur to me at present. So much with reference to the heavenly
   proclamation. Now let us investigate the sense of this pair of visions,
   to which we observed it was a forerunner; and let us do this, as far as
   is allowable, in a future event, with the sobriety and modesty which
   become us. And first of the harvest, by which the primary step is taken
   towards consummation.

   "And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sitting
   like the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand
   a sharp sickle. And another angel went out of the temple, crying with a
   loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Put forth thy sickle and reap;
   for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is
   ripe. And he who sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth,
   and the earth was reaped."

   The word harvest embraces three things,--the mowing down, the gathering
   in, and the threshing of the corn. Whence it follows, that it
   constitutes a two-fold parable in the sacred writings, and of a
   contrary meaning. Sometimes in that of slaughter and destruction, as of
   reaping and threshing; sometimes in that of restitution and salvation,
   in the sense of gathering in. An example of the former is to be met
   with in Jeremiah, ch. li. 33, where he thus speaks of the destruction
   of Babylon. "The daughter of Babylon is as a threshing-floor, the time
   of her threshing is come; yet a little while, and the time of her
   harvest will come." Also Isaiah, ch. xvii. 5, &c. of the fall of
   Damascus, and the slaughter of Israel by Tiglathpileser. "And it shall
   be, as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and his arm reapeth the
   ears." But an example of the latter is scarcely any where else to be
   found than in the New Testament. "The harvest," says our Saviour, "is
   great, but the labourers are few." There are not wanting some, however,
   who interpret in this sense that complaint of Israel in Jeremiah, ch.
   viii. 20, "The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not
   saved." The time is past in which we thought ourselves safe, and we are
   not saved. Let us search out, if possible, which of the figures the
   harvest sustains in the present passage from the order of those
   transactions, which the Holy Spirit has elsewhere represented to us
   concerning the same times of the Church. That the treading of the
   winepress, by which the vintage succeeding the harvest is accomplished,
   is the same with that bloody slaughter executed by him who sits on the
   white horse, ch. xix. 15, is manifest from what is inserted in the
   description of the rider. "He it is who treadeth the winepress of the
   fierceness of the wrath of God Almighty." Now this being an
   acknowledged datum, it follows of course, that the prophetical
   parables, which equally and immediately precede each, and without any
   other vision intervening, must either denote the same thing, or if they
   are different events, yet by some means connected and interwoven with
   each other. Since, therefore, here. the harvest immediately precedes
   the vintage, and there the preparation of the nuptials of the Lamb,
   together with the fall of Babylon precede that fierce slaughter, it
   follows indisputably, that either that preparation or destruction is
   the harvest of which we are in search, and that they relate to the same
   circumstance as the harvest does, or the harvest to the same as they
   do. If we were to say that the devastation of Babylon was the harvest,
   it would sufficiently agree both with the character of the type, which
   implies reaping and threshing, and particularly it would favour a
   little the example of Jeremiah, predicting the fall of the ancient
   Babylon, under the same figure. The passage is the same which I just
   now quoted. To this likewise must be added, that since both the harvest
   and the vintage, as they finish the year, denote the end and
   consummation of all things; but the harvest would precede the vintage
   in time; therefore, if it were certainly known that either were applied
   to signify the consummation of the Roman tyranny, the harvest would
   very appositely designate the destruction of the city, as the
   first-fruits of this full destruction; the vintage succeeding that
   harvest would point out the extinction of the whole kingdom of the
   beast, to follow the former at no long interval of time. Nor is there
   any thing to oppose this accommodation but that one circumstance, that
   the laying waste of Babylon, as we have hitherto presupposed, is not
   found to take place immediately before that dreadful slaughter,
   expressed likewise by the image of the vintage, ch. xix., but another
   event, subsequent, as it appears, to the laying waste of Babylon,
   namely, the preparation for the nuptials of the Lamb, or the
   embellishment of his bride. Will not then the harvest be a
   signification of that preparation? or (it that be unsuitable) of some
   other event to be transacted at the same time

   But what, you will ask, is that preparation of the bride? What is it
   which is to be transacted at the same time with this? In truth, I do
   not see how that preparation of the bride can be any thing else than
   the conversion and collection of Israel, expected for so many ages; of
   her, who formerly, (according to our Saviour's parable,) when invited
   to the nuptials of the king's son, refused to come, but now hastens to
   meet him, promptly and prepared. For the Gentiles, as it appears,
   cannot possibly be called that bride, because they have been long ago,
   and for many ages, espoused to Christ. The Jews, therefore, are those
   who are yet expected to become the spouse of the Lamb.

   But with this conversion and restoration of Israel, (by which she will
   be adopted into the virgin company of the Lamb, and will become a part
   of it,) will be joined the reaping or destruction of the Turkish
   empire, according to what we read at the sixth phial, but under another
   figure, that "the water of the great river Euphrates should be dried
   up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared." For the
   time of this phial manifestly agrees with the time of the preparation
   of the bride, since, as that was introduced between the destruction of
   Babylon and the last slaughter of the enemies of the Church, so this
   phial intervenes between that which is poured out on the throne of the
   beast, and the last phial. That is, the Church of Christ, as it was
   about to become double by the conversion of Israel; so each part
   appears to have, at that time, its own peculiar enemy; the former the
   Roman beast, with its uncircumcised origin; the latter, the Mohammedan
   empire, over a circumcised people, and of an Ismaelitish origin,
   ominous to the descendants of Isaac. Of the extermination of both of
   which, to be accomplished at the coming of Christ, why should not the
   harvest represent the one, and the vintage the other?

   Moreover, to this interpretation of the harvest, the prophecy of Joel
   will afford, if not absolutely confirmation, yet at least some
   appearance of probability; from which both the image of the harvest and
   the vintage was taken. For it is manifest, that he is there treating of
   the time of the conversion of Israel, even from the first words of the
   Oracle, (Joel, ch. iii. v. 2.) "In those days, and in that time, when I
   shall bring back again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem; I will
   gather all nations in the valley of Jehosaphat, and will plead with
   them there for my people, and for my heritage Israel, whom they have
   scattered among the nations, and divided my land." Then follows, in the
   suggested type of a warlike array, "Put ye in the sickles, for the
   harvest is ripe. Come, get ye down, for the winepress is full, the fats
   overflow, for their wickedness is great."

   Since, then, we may observe in this accommodation of the figure of the
   harvest, that the event transacted may be so compared, that either
   notion of the harvest, that of reaping and threshing as well as that of
   gathering in, may be adapted to it, the latter with reference to Israel
   gathered together into the garner of the Church; the former to the
   slaughter of enemies in conjunction with that event; yet as the matter
   here treated of is the last effort of the Church against its foes, I
   think that the notion of reaping and threshing is altogether to be
   preferred.

   But whatever the harvest may be, the description proves that Christ
   himself as king will assuredly be the Lord of it, and the director of
   the work of reaping the corn. For to what other king than him is that
   title of the Son of man coming in the chariot of a cloud, attributed
   through the whole course of Scripture? So that, in my opinion, it is by
   no means safe to wrest it to any other meaning. It is rather to be
   collected, that the power of the Divinity in discharging the duties of
   that harvest, as well as in the vintage next to come, will be more
   conspicuous and illustrious than in any of those works, which were
   performed only in the names of angels.

   Hitherto we have formed conjectures respecting the harvest. Let us now
   proceed to the vintage; which, as it usually does in the order of
   events, it is agreeable to reason that it should succeed the harvest.

   "And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also
   having a sharp sickle. And another angel came out from the altar,
   having power over fire, and he cried with a great cry to him that had
   the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the
   clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe. And
   the angel put in his sickle upon the earth, and gathered the produce of
   the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the
   wrath of God. And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood
   came out of the winepress up to the bridles of the horses, for the
   space of a thousand six hundred furlongs."

   This is the description of the vintage; to the interpretation of which
   we shall with more certainty direct our aim, because the signification
   of the parable is less ambiguous, and the meaning of treading the
   clusters is more express, since the treading of the vintage in
   parabolical Scripture constantly denotes a fierce, deadly, and cruel
   slaughter. This is our first observation. And then those words about
   treading the winepress of the wrath of God, inserted in that
   description, show that this is the same with that great slaughter in
   ch. xix. as I have just now observed. Therefore also, it will be the
   same with "the battle of the great day of the Lord God Almighty," at
   the last phial; for that the deadly slaughter in ch. xix. is the same
   as that, we cannot doubt, since both arc the last destruction of the
   same enemy; for both ultimately impend over the beast, the false
   prophet, and their confederates. But it is impossible there should be
   more than one last slaughter of the same persons. Now, if our vintage
   signifies the same destruction with those, it must also impend over the
   same enemies, and therefore over the beast, and the false prophet. The
   vine, therefore, or vineyard of the earth, of which mention is here
   made, is the dominion of the beast. The grapes ripe for gathering are
   the followers of the beast, swelling with the guilt of blood, ripe for
   judgment. The lake, in the last place, or winepress, is the place of
   slaughter, the same in truth as in the seventh phial, interpreted
   according to the Hebrew, is called Armageddon; perhaps because there
   the troops or forces of the beast will be extirpated by a deadly
   destruction. For arma means chdvv', destruction; gedon, or geddon,
   gdvn, troop, army, or their army. "He gathered them together," says he,
   "in a place called in the Hebrew language Armageddon. (the books
   published by Plautinus have only the single D, Armagedon.) And the
   seventh angel poured out his phial in the air, and a great voice came
   out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done." But
   where the winepress, or place for treading the grapes will be, is yet
   hid among the secret things of God; nor is it on that account to be too
   curiously investigated by us, nor to be pointed out, until either the
   event shall disclose it, or a state of things more nearly advanced to
   it, shall perhaps afford some indication of it. It will be allowable
   however to observe, without any charge of temerity, that from so
   accurate a measurement of the space, for which the slaughter should
   extend, it may seem that the Holy Spirit directs our attention to some
   region, which stretches one thousand six hundred furlongs in length,
   for he shows us that the carnage shall take place without the city, for
   so many furlongs; that is, if I am not mistaken, in the region or
   dominion of the city. Hence it follows, that some have thought the Holy
   Land was marked out by that circuit, as what accurately contains so
   many furlongs in its length, that is, 200 Italian miles, though not
   more than 160 Greek, which Jerome reports in his epistle to Dardanus
   was the length of the Holy Land. For the Greeks, they say, measured
   their mile by ten furlongs, each of which were a hundred paces; but the
   pace (which they call orgya) was six Roman feet; so that in the whole a
   Greek mile contained 6000 Roman feet. The Romans, on the contrary,
   define the pace by five feet, the furlong by 125 paces, the mile by
   eight furlongs, that is, only 5000 feet. Whence it comes to pass, that
   the Greek mile, though it agrees with the Roman in the number of 1000
   paces, is yet greater than the Roman by a fifth part. So that 200 Roman
   miles make no more than 160 Greek.

   This is the sum of the argument. Besides, it is not altogether
   unimportant, in addition to this conjecture, that the name of the place
   is called in the Hebrew language Armageddon, as if it were to be in the
   land of the Hebrews. But after all, by what means could this possibly
   take place? Indeed, to those who imagine Antichrist is to come from the
   East, this opinion is very natural and easy; but not so to us, unless
   some one perhaps should think it probable, that the false prophet,
   after the overthrow of Rome, should migrate into the East, and there
   fix his seat; which there are not wanting some among the followers of
   the beast who maintain, that is, that before the last day of judgment,
   the Roman pontiff shall have his habitation at Jerusalem. For
   certainly, that the beast with his affairs at home, placed in such a
   state, and in such jeopardy in the West, as is supposed, should again
   (as formerly in the expedition to Jerusalem) lead an army into
   Palestine, leaving many enemies behind him, and there at length be
   entirely put an end to, cannot be affirmed with any show of
   probability. But farther, that we who assert a Western Antichrist may
   not be inferior on this side to those who suppose an Eastern one, there
   is also a place in the neighbourhood, with which the assigned number of
   furlongs agrees; for instance, the Stato della Chiesa, or the
   possessions of the Roman Church, which, from the city of Rome to the
   mouth of the Po, and the marshes of Verona, extend to the space of 200
   Italian miles, that is, 1600 furlongs.

   But whither am I digressing? Let us at length impose a restraint on
   curiosity, in which perhaps we have hitherto too much indulged. Let us
   come to other matters which will be more worth our consideration. And
   therefore, in the first place, that the gatherer of the grapes, and the
   treader of the winepress, are not the same person; but, as the offices
   of the vintager and the winepresser are different, so likewise they
   have different agents; the vintage or gathering in, an angel furnished
   with a vine-hook the treading, Christ himself, as King, accompanied
   with heavenly horsemen, which may clearly appear from the vision of the
   xixth chapter (for I have often quoted it). For there St. John saw
   "heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat upon it was
   called faithful, and true, and in righteousness does he judge, and make
   war,"" and he was clothed with a garment dipped in blood, and he was
   called by name, The Word of God."--"And the armies that were in heaven
   followed him on white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and
   clean."--"And out of his mouth proceeded a sharp sword, that with it he
   should smite the nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of iron,
   and he treadeth the winepress of the indignation and wrath of God
   Almighty." Can any thing be said more clearly? And therefore, in the
   context on which we are throwing light to the utmost of our ability, it
   is by no means said that the angel who gathered or cut off the
   clusters, was the same as trod the winepress, but only, that he cast
   the gathered clusters into the winepress, which being done, "the
   winepress was trodden without the city;" by whom, unless by Christ the
   King, proceeding from heaven, with his celestial troop? That doubtless
   is what the Holy Spirit would signify by the mention of horses
   immediately subjoined; "And the blood came out of the winepress, even
   to the horses' bridles." For why is that allusion to horses inserted,
   unless to admonish us by this token, that the winepress was trodden by
   him to whom that equestrian force belonged? To circumscribe the matter
   then in few words, this is the sum of the vision respecting the
   vintage. An angel vintager, with the assistance of the saints, the
   presidency over whom was committed to him for this purpose, will prune
   and cut off the clusters of the beast, and, during his pruning, will
   cause them to be gathered together at Armageddon, and those who are
   gathered, the Lord Jesus Christ will at length tread under at his
   coming; according to what St. Paul says of the "man of sin," (who is
   this very beast,) that he shall be destroyed by the Lord "with the
   brightness of his coming."

   Now the harvest, as well as the vintage, is supplicated by prayers; the
   former, as it appears, by those of the Church universal; whence the
   angel who there sustains the person of the suppliants, is said
   generally to come out of the temple. But the latter is rather enforced
   by martyrs and confessors, against whom the wicked had raged with
   butcheries and torments, and had made them victims to Christ. On which
   account, the angel who proclaims to this effect, goes out of the
   thysiasterium, or enclosure of the altar, and is said to have power
   over fire, even the fire of martyrdom. It is very commonly observed,
   that the blood of the martyrs cries to God for vengeance. For, indeed,
   the Scripture every where testifies, that the Divine Power will bestow
   on the Church neither a state of prosperity, nor vengeance on their
   enemies, without the prayers of its members. So the Babylonian
   captivity was put an end to at the prayers of Daniel; and in the
   parable of the widow fatiguing the unjust judge by her clamorous
   entreaties, the application is, that God would be aroused in like
   manner by the prayers of his elect, to come at length at some fit time
   to avenge them. You may add, that when the trumpets were sounded for
   the demolition of the Roman empire, the prayers of the martyrs by
   incense offered up, are first recalled to the memory of God.

   Hear then, O Christ our King! and recall to the memory of thy Father,
   so many suppliant prayers of thy people, for thy kingdom, so many
   groans of the afflicted, and of those who were slain for thy name; and
   when the time shall come which will appear seasonable to thee, arise,
   reap, and gather in the vintage!

   [37] By those words, "Thou must prophesy again," (by which the type of
   the eaten book is explained,) it is intimated that the following system
   of visions goes over again the Apocalyptical time from the very
   beginning. But if any vision of that prophetic system is to be sought
   for from the commencement of the period or Apocalyptical time, it is
   certainly agreeable to reason, that the first vision of the system

   because it is the sum and compendium of all that follow.

NOTE.

   Thus far, O Reader, I have been able to proceed in a detailed species
   of interpretation. But I can carry it no farther. In the prophecies
   which remain I only give instances; a part of those, in truth, which
   three or four years ago, I had privately communicated to my friends, on
   most of the apocalyptical visions. Those, whatever they are, I commend,
   O Reader, to thy candour, and beseech thee to interpret favourably;
   until Almighty God bestow upon me strength and leisure, and the power
   (unless the judgment of learned and pious men should deter me) of
   unfolding these prophecies, by a clew similar to that by which I
   expounded the former. Besides, you may see, that in these I cannot
   preserve the order of the chapter so exactly, since I placed the
   mystery of Babylon before the vision of the phials, which, however, St.
   John postponed; whether it was because one of the angels of the phials
   showed it to him, or whether he wished to subjoin a key, as it were,
   for unlocking all the preceding visions. Both seem to have been in
   view. But the same order is not always convenient to the interpreter
   and the historian.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Of the Metropolis of Christian Apostasy, the mystic Babylon.

   The metropolis of the apostasy, Babylon the mystery, or the mystic
   Babylon, is the city Rome, or, as we now say, the Roman see; from the
   spouse of Christ in former times, become not only the harlot, but also
   the mother of harlots. The metropolis of prostitutes, that is, the head
   of cities, nominally Christian, committing fornication with
   her.--Where, Reader, I would wish you, even in the commencement, to
   observe, (because we are now in the very citadel of the Apocalypse),
   that the great and catholic apostasy of the visible Christian Church,
   is defined and marked by the Holy Spirit, not for any other heresies or
   errors than that spiritual adultery, so earnestly reprobated also in
   ancient Israel. This then alone ought to be regarded as a Cynosure by
   him who would wish to investigate the beginning, progress, state, and
   decline of the apostasy of Christianity, from the records of
   ecclesiastical affairs. If he attend to it in this view, he may even
   feel what is sought for; but if otherwise, he will be disappointed or
   uncertain. For though Babylon herself be guilty of other errors, nay,
   of heresies, (for it is not a novel case for harlots and adulteresses
   to be infamous for other vices and crimes), yet, since the Holy Spirit
   has pointed out that great apostasy of the visible Church by none of
   those, therefore, they are to be accounted either as symptoms only of
   that apostasy, or as adventitious errors, equally common to other times
   and sects; or if the heresy were possibly of great importance, yet it
   was of such a kind (as that of justification and salvation being to be
   hoped for from the merit of works), as was late, and when the harlot
   was far advanced in age, admitted into the Church by the just judgment
   of God; lest they, who had so long and so obstinately despised the
   long-suffering of God, and the preaching of the witnesses, should
   afterwards (as we read to have been prohibited to our first parents)
   "stretch out their hands, and take the fruit of the tree of life, and
   eat, and live for ever."

   Moreover, Reader, it is singular in this place, and not to be passed
   over with a slight remark, (of which, therefore, I have reminded thee
   in the Apocalyptical Key,) that this vision of the great harlot, and of
   the beast which carried her, is disclosed in an unusual manner to St.
   John, and to us, by the clearest interpretation; and undoubtedly for
   this end, that by the help of this interpretation, as of the chief of
   all the visions, the other Apocalyptical mysteries likewise,--hitherto
   closed, but depending upon that, by an admirable contrivance,--might be
   laid open. Let this reflection, then, be present to your minds, and
   that the angel, as far as relates to you, may not have undertaken his
   labours in vain, duly and rightly remember, that the interpretation of
   an allegory or parable (of which kind is this of the angel) is not a
   new parable or allegory. For what an inconsistency would this be, or
   more truly, insanity, on the part of an interpreter! Do not therefore
   listen here to I know not what ages of the world, or similar
   suppositions, but understand the intention of the prophesying angel as
   no longer allegorizing, but interpreting according to the expression,
   knowing that to you remains the duty, not of unfolding the meaning of
   an allegory, but of applying the interpretation of it now given, to the
   events themselves.

   To which application, as far as God has revealed it to me, I will thus
   lead the way.

   First. The woman whom John saw sitting on the beast, "is that great
   city which reigneth over the kings of the earth."

   Application.--What city is this but Rome [60] ?

   Second. The beast which bore her who was now become a harlot, is the
   same beast which, even before the vision exhibited to John, existed in
   another form of its own, but not yet in that in which it carried the
   harlot. But it was afterwards to rise again from the abyss, in such a
   form, and in that, at length, utterly to perish. That is, the form in
   which it carried the harlot would be the last form of the beast, beyond
   which it would not prolong its existence. It follows in the same verse,
   (in order that you might recognise this to be the very same beast which
   was shown in ch. xiii.) "And the inhabitants of the earth wondered,
   whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of
   the world, when they beheld the beast which was, and is not, and yet is
   to be [61] ."--for so I read with the Complutensian edition, according
   to the interpretation of Primasius and Syrus, that it may agree in
   sense with the preceding description. "The beast which was, and is not,
   and shall ascend out of the abyss." In what form he was first a beast,
   in what he was hereafter to ascend from the abyss, we may discover from
   those words which the angel afterwards subjoins.

   Application.--But if the woman be Rome, what can this many-formed beast
   be on which she rides, (that is, over which she rules,) but the Roman
   kingdom or empire [62] ?"

   Third. The seven heads of the beast are a double type. First, there are
   seven mountains or hills on which the city, which was the metropolis of
   the beast, was situated; and besides also, seven orders of kings, or
   successive dynasties, and that on the same hills, (which the unity of
   the type denotes.)

   "Hoc teneas vultus mutantem Protea node."

   By this knot you may detain Proteus when he changes his appearance.
   Five of them, indeed, kings, consuls, tribunes, decemvirs, dictators,
   were even then passed away in the age of John. One (that of the Cæsars)
   yet remained; but that likewise was so to be changed under the
   Christian Cæsars, that it would appear as another dynasty, but for a
   very short time, yet, in truth, not be another. The last, indeed, and
   the eighth, as I have just said, with respect to the changed
   Ciesareate, but in reality only the seventh,--for there are only seven
   heads on the beast,--is that under which the beast was ropi4opoc, the
   carrier of a harlot; that is, the bearer of the mystical harlot; and in
   that state and appearance it was seen by John in the present vision; in
   whose time, indeed, it might be said it was formerly, and still was not
   yet come. For formerly it was a beast under the rule of the five former
   heads, and partly of the sixth, but it was not come in that of the last
   head, to wit, that of the pontificate, in which, in fine, it carried
   the harlot.

   Application.--Now, then, Reader, attend! If the sixth head of the Roman
   beast, which was reigning in the age of John over the seven-hilled
   city, has now ceased to reign on the same for almost twelve centuries,
   it necessarily follows that he who now possesses the authority (since
   it can by no means be called a kind of seventh, and a head of a very
   short date) must be that last, long-lived, and real seventh dynasty of
   the seven hills; and, therefore, that state or republic of the nations,
   over which Rome now watches, and has long watched,--that dynasty which
   John foresaw, as to carry the harlot.

   Fourth. The ten horns of the beast, the insignia of the last head, are
   ten kingdoms, which were not yet arisen in the age of John, but into
   which the body of the Roman beast was to be dilacerated in its last
   form, by the wound of its Cæsarean head; and which would unanimously
   confer all their power on the beast, renewed and re-established under
   the government of its last head.

   Application.--Now, unless from the time in which the Cæsars ceased to
   reign in Rome, the Roman empire was divided and dilacerated into ten or
   more kingdoms, (even of nations which were foreigners and barbarians to
   the empire in the age of John,) when, I beseech you, or in what manner,
   shall we ever expect it to be divided??

   Fifth. But these ten kingdoms which so coalesced under the auspices of
   their head, the false prophet, shall fight with the Lamb. The victory,
   however, will finally belong to the Lamb our Lord.

   Application.--The former has been long since done, and even takes
   place, at the present day. The latter is now done, in some respects,
   but we hope will be completed at some future time, by a much more
   glorious victory; since, out of those ten horns, or kings, there will
   be some, who at length will hate the harlot, whom they have so long
   servilely assisted in supporting, (which, we perceive, partly
   fulfilled,) "will render her desolate and naked, will eat her flesh,
   and burn her with fire." For God, by whose providence it came to pass,
   that they agreed with so marvellous a consent in supporting this beast
   of the last head, even to the time appointed, will, at some future
   time, put it into their hearts to execute his will on their metropolis,
   the harlot. Thus far the angel.

   As to what remains in the description of the allegory, that this harlot
   "had a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations, and filthiness of
   her fornication;" and also, that "she bore in her forehead her name
   written;" did not require the interpretation of the angel, since there
   is an allusion in both to the ancient custom of harlots and of the
   stews, where they used to drink philtres out of a golden cup to their
   lovers. In those places the cells were inscribed with the name of the
   harlots, as Tertullian shows in his book on Modesty, &c. &c. Besides,
   if the harlot were famous, it appears that, not only on the cell, but
   on her forehead, she bore her name and eulogy written, &c. &c.

THE FALL OF ANTICHRIST,

   Or the meaning of the Seven Phials, as far as we are yet permitted to
   understand it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   And first, Of the Phials generally.

   The Holy Spirit propounds the history of the phials, and of the angels
   who pour them out, in a two-fold manner. First, generally, from the
   beginning of chapter xv. to the end of the fifth verse, where the
   vision of the seven angels holding the seven phials being related to
   the conclusion, before he comes to the particular description either of
   the angels or the phials, the narration of another vision exhibited
   together with them, is introduced, by which the state of the Church is
   described while the effusion is going on, cleansed from defilements,
   and the filthiness of idolatry, in that sacred laver of the temple or
   sea, not made as Solomon's, of brazen materials, but of crystal, and
   singing, during the whole time of the effusion, the Epinikion, or song
   of victory over the vanquished beast [63] , and that while she was but
   just coming forth from the bath in which she was purified, and while
   she yet remained on the margin of the laver. He then goes on to the
   clothing and apparatus of the angels, and to the phials specially, from
   those words of the 5th verse.

   "And the seven angels, having the seven last plagues, came out of the
   temple, clothed in linen, pure and splendid, and girt round the breast
   with golden girdles;" that is, adorned with the sacerdotal habit and
   girdle. Ezekiel c. xliv. v. 17, 18.

   Take care not to join the words which we have quoted with those of the
   preceding verse; for what is there said of the temple of the tabernacle
   of testimony in heaven being opened, relates mot to the beginning, but
   to the end of the phials; for the temple, which, while the phials were
   pouring out, "was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his
   power, so that no man could enter therein," (and here there is an
   allusion both to the dedication of the tabernacle, Exod. c. xl. v. 34,
   35, and also to the twice seven days' dedication of the temple, 1
   Kings, c. viii. v. 10. 2 Chron. c. v. 13,) will be rendered so dear
   when the phials are completely exhausted, that the Ark of the testimony
   (Christ) will become conspicuous, as is the case at the sound of the
   seventh trumpet, ch. xi. with which it has been shown in the third
   Synchronism, Part 2d, the last of the phials is contemporary.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [63] It is called the Song of Moses and of the Lamb, because the Lord
   alone is to be worshipped and glorified as God. Which signification of
   this song, as equally proceeding from Moses and the Lamb, was now
   promulgated to men.
     __________________________________________________________________

  HYPOTHESIS

   Concerning the Phials, one by one.

   First, The effusion of the phials signifies the ruin of the
   antichristian beast.

   This is apparent from the text, concerning which see Synchronism vii.
   part 1st. For as the former, and more ancient polity of the Roman
   empire was subverted by the plagues of the trumpets, so the last is to
   be subverted by the plagues of the phials. This is the cause of so
   great a similarity between them, since the last bears the image of the
   former Roman polity.

   Secondly, The seven phials -are so many gradations of its ruin; for as
   the beast rose by degrees, so likewise will he be abolished by degrees.

   Thirdly, Whatever that may be on which each of the phials is poured
   out, it suffers loss and injury by the phials; since the effusion of
   the phials is the effusion of the wrath of God. No interpretation,
   therefore, can possibly stand, by which the effusion of a phial would
   contribute to the good of that on which it is poured out.

   Fourthly, The earth, the sea, the rivers, the sun, are something
   relative to the antichristian beast, which resemble the earth, the sea,
   the rivers, and the sun. For all the phials are poured upon the beast,
   and therefore each relates to something connected with the beast, or at
   least affecting his interest.

   Fifthly, The whole body of the beast, or the antichristian universe, is
   tacitly compared by the Holy Spirit, in the same manner as in the
   trumpets, to the mundane system, of which the different parts are the
   earth, the sea, the rivers, heaven, and the luminaries, so that the
   earth in the pontificate universe would be so called from its
   resemblance to the earth, the sea from the same likeness to the sea,
   the rivers to the rivers, and the sun to the sun in the natural world.

   Sixthly, Lastly (as we have observed more than once), because God
   employs angels as ministers of his providence, in exciting and
   directing the movements and revolutions of human affairs; therefore,
   those things which are performed by the hands of many, are yet
   attributed to an angel, as the president and director of the event to
   be transacted, according to a common mode of speaking.
     __________________________________________________________________

  AN EXPOSITION

   Of the Phials, according to the Rule of these Hypotheses.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Phial the First. On the Earth, the Universe connected with the Beast.

   The earth, in the antichristian universe, signifies the people at
   large, or the Christian vulgar; the footstool (to its shame be it
   spoken,) of Antichrist, constructed on which, as on a base, the
   hierarchal papal edifice, like the tower of Babylon, lifts its head to
   the ethereal regions,--"Vertice ad auras ætherias tendit." On this
   earth of the beast, the first phial being poured out, it contracted an
   ailment from the effusion, so as to fill the followers of the beast
   with fury and violence as with ulcers, and those so fierce and
   malignant, that they could not be cured, nay, even a tendency to
   healing could not be brought on without being broken again, and thereby
   renewed.

   This was fulfilled, when the lower orders of Christians, whether known
   by the names of the Waldensians, Albigensians, Wicliffites, Hussites,
   or by any other names, began every where to renounce the authority of
   the beast, crying out, that Rome was the apocalyptical Babylon, and
   that the pope was Antichrist. By which vapour on the earth, now glowing
   with the wrath of God, the followers of the beast being affected, grew
   all very hot with the sores of grief and indignation, by which, excited
   to rage, they dealt most cruelly with fire and flame against their
   opponents, in a wonderful manner for many years; but in vain, for they
   were disquieted by a bad and incurable ulcer, which the more they
   agitated themselves, became so much the worse from day to day. So
   formerly the land of Egypt, sprinkled by the Divine command with ashes
   of the furnace, rendered all the servants of Pharaoh, and their cattle,
   full of ulcers.

   Now the world of the beast is in ch. xi. spiritually called Egypt, and
   therefore this plague of the ulcers is to be spiritually interpreted,
   that is, mystically, and by analogy, and this likewise in the
   figurative representation of the two following plagues, is to be
   diligently observed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Phial the Second, On the Sea of the Bestial World.

   The sea, in the antichristian world, is the compass of the pontifical
   communion; by which not only individual Christians, but whole nations,
   peoples, kingdoms, provinces, dioceses, otherwise disjoined and
   separated from each other, are collected into one. Or, the
   antichristian sea is the circumference of the pontifical jurisdiction
   or dominion, enclosing and enfolding Christian nations, as the sea does
   the earth.

   The second phial being poured out on this sea, it becomes thereupon "as
   the blood of a corpse," or cold and coagulated blood, as that of dead
   and slain persons, or of a member cut off, when the connexion with the
   fountain of life being dissolved, it is deprived of the influx of
   spirit and warmth. The sense is, the pontifical sea was made a
   sacrifice of by death, dismemberment, and butchery.

   Now this was fulfilled, when by the labour of Luther, and other
   illustrious reformers of that acre while God in a wonderful manner
   favoured their undertakings, no longer some individuals only of the
   Christian community, but whole provinces, dioceses, kingdoms, nations,
   and cities, renounced communion with the beast; and having made a great
   mutilation of his ancient most extensive empire, forcibly wrested from
   the body of the beast, withdrew from it. By which event, the sea of the
   pontifical dominion became in great measure dead, and like the blood of
   a dead man, in which the pontifical animals could no longer breathe and
   live.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Phial the Third, On the Rivers and Fountains of Waters of the Bestial
   World.

   The rivers and fountains of waters in the world of the beast, are the
   ministers and defenders of the antichristian jurisdiction; whether
   ecclesiastical, as the jesuits, and other emissary priests, or even
   seculars and laymen, as the Spanish champions; to each of whom an
   office is committed by that jurisdiction, of managing and promoting the
   cause, which they call Catholic. Since, as rivers derive their origin
   from the sea, so likewise they apply their service and assistance to
   increase and maintain the same, in like manner as the rivers return
   into the sea.

   Now these rivers, while they rashly pursue their courses, where it was
   no longer safe fur them to go on, become tinged with blood by the
   effusion of the third phial, as they likewise had formerly imbrued with
   blood the saints of God, and his prophets. In fact, from this phial,
   the affairs of the beast were to fall into such a state, that his
   ministers and defenders, having changed places with those whom they
   persecuted, were compelled to undergo the same death, by which they had
   been accustomed to sacrifice the saints and prophets of God, while
   their dominion flourished; as is clearly explained in v. 5 and 6, being
   the key for unlocking the parable. And this I am inclined to think was
   then completed with regard to ecclesiastical emissaries, and their
   attendants, when in our kingdom of England, during the reign of
   Elizabeth, of glorious memory, and even afterwards, those sanguinary
   managers of the authority of the beast, even by laws published for that
   purpose, expiated their administration by their blood, (a circumstance
   which had never befallen them before.) And not they only, but those who
   were much more formidable than them, the Spanish champions of the cause
   of the beast, in the endeavour to recover his dominion for the Roman
   Church by arms, while they thirsted for blood, drank blood in large
   draughts, especially in that memorable slaughter of the year 1588, and
   the following years, the English and Belgians, by sea and land, pouring
   out copiously the cup from the powerful hand of God. So that there was
   a wonderful cry of applause to the just and true judgments of God, not
   only from those islanders who were now revenging the blood of their own
   people formerly shed, but also from the neighbouring French, who were
   still groaning under the cross, and the altar; nay, in the recent
   butchery of the year 1572.

   And thus far the phials seem to have proceeded; the rest yet remain to
   be poured out.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Phial the Fourth, On the Sun of the Bestial Heaven.

   That we may discover what the sun is in the world of the beast, we must
   first see what the heaven is in that world, lest otherwise, destitute
   of the clew of analogy, we wander too much from the mark. For the sun
   is not to be placed, or conceived to exist, but in a heaven suitable to
   it. The heaven, then, of the antichristian world is the supreme and
   universal pontifical power itself, or, in short, whatever exists of
   more sublime and regal authority in any part of the bestial world; that
   is, in the whole community of provinces acknowledging the Roman pontiff
   as their head. For so, in the natural world, all that is on high, and
   above the earth and waters, is called heaven, in the acceptation of the
   Hebrews, and of the Holy Spirit.

   Now in this antichristian heaven (according to the type of the natural
   heaven) there are many stars, and of different magnitudes,--princes,
   governors, presidents, rulers, kings. There are likewise great
   luminaries like the sun and moon, which all appear to move round with
   the motion of heaven itself, and undergo their vicissitudes, from the
   law which governs it. Of this, indeed, the most splendid, and by far
   the greatest luminary which shines in the Papal firmament, is the
   German empire, which has been the possession of the house of Austria
   for about two hundred years. Is not this the sun of that heaven [64] ?
   Now on this sun is the fourth phial forthwith to be poured out; so that
   he, driven out of his usual course in the heaven of the beast, and
   shining in a different manner, may scorch and torment with heat and
   fervour, even to blasphemy, the inhabitants of the antichristian world,
   whom he was formerly accustomed greatly to cheer with his warmth and
   radiance. And lo! while I am publishing these remarks, on which I had
   long ago written a Commentary, a report has filled the whole Christian
   world, while the pious are offering up their gratulations, that an
   avenger from God has come from. the North, to succour afflicted and
   depressed Germany--a king pious and fortunate, and a conqueror wherever
   he has come, whose successes surpass the flight of the eagle. Is not
   this he whom the Lord of Hosts has destined, to execute the work of
   this phial? So I hope and pray from my soul,--"Gird thee then with thy
   sword, O great King I proceed prosperously and reign, for the sake of
   truth, of meekness, and of righteousness; for thy right hand shall
   teach thee terrible things [65] ."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [64] With all due deference to the foresight of the venerable author,
   but with greater facilities of judging from the lapse of time since
   this conjecture was formed, may we not suppose France to be the country
   more peculiarly designated? Of this kingdom, which assumed the emblem
   of the sun as the mark of its dignity, Clovis or Louis was the first
   Christian king. In the reign of the XVIth Louis did this kingdom
   undergo the most stupendous revolution which has taken place for many
   centuries; overturning the throne and the altar, setting on fire, as we
   may say, the Papal world, destroying vast, armies by the valour of its
   troops and the force of its artillery, devastating other countries, and
   at length exciting the most violent opposition to its progress in
   surrounding nations. It was this kingdom which in Charlemagne gave the
   first emperor to the Papal Roman empire, though the seat of his
   dominion was afterwards transferred to Germany. It was in a soi-disant
   emperor, who copied his example, that the Pope was enthralled, and
   compelled to adopt the suggestions of this temporary ruler. The author
   of this note cannot help adding, as a remarkable circumstance, that on
   the 19th of January, 1793, picture of the sun the day on which the king
   of France was condemned, he saw, without the help of a glass, through a
   thin fog, large spots on the sun's surface, one of which appeared as a
   fissure of many digits in extent; such as he understood from Mr. Vince,
   Plumian Professor of Astronomy at Cambridge, were never recorded to
   have been seen before by the naked eye.--Vide Ann. Reg. 1793.--R. B. C.

   [65] This relates, I suppose, to the king of Sweden, and is surely a
   proof how careful we should be in the interpretation of prophetical
   scripture, when we see so enlightened and cautious a commentator as
   Mede led to apply an important part of the great scheme of prophecy to
   passing events.-- R. B. C.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Phial the Fifth, On the Throne of the Beast.

   The fifth phial is to be poured out on the throne or seat of the beast;
   that is, on Rome itself: And now the Holy Spirit no longer conceals the
   subject under the veil of figures or allegories, perhaps on account of
   the great light then to arise on those prophecies; when this sort of
   Mercurial sign being seen, it will no longer be ambiguous how much
   progress the phials have made, and how much yet remains to be completed
   by them.

   By this destruction of the Roman city, (which I think to be the very
   same as is said ch. xi. 13, to follow the resurrection and ascension of
   the witnesses,) the name of the pontificate will not utterly perish,
   but will then be despoiled of its glory and splendour, so that "they
   shall gnaw their tongues for pain." In the meanwhile, however, still
   persevering in their impenitence, with obstinate minds, they will abuse
   their sufferings by additional blasphemy.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Phial the Sixth, On Euphrates.

   The sixth phial will be poured out on the great river Euphrates; so
   that, being dried up, a passage may be prepared for the new enemies of
   the beast to come from the East, that is, for the Israelites,
   wonderfully converted to the pure faith and worship of Christ, and now
   become candidates for the kingdom promised for so many ages. Whom the
   followers of the beast, perhaps, may be inclined to consider as the
   army of their fictitious antichrist, to arise from the Jews, of whom
   they do not hesitate to assert, that even we of this day are the
   forerunners. God thus avenging their obstinacy in error.

   Now two things induce me to understand "the kings, to come (as it is
   said) from the rising of the sun," as spoken of the Jews. First, that
   it is the last phial but one, during which, therefore, if the Jews are
   not converted, it must necessarily come to pass, that they would be
   destroyed with the other enemies of Christ, in the number of whom they
   would still be included, in that great day of universal vengeance and
   judgment, which the next and last phial introduces. Besides the passage
   in Isaiah referring to the same event, brings me to this conclusion,
   from which, in all probability, this part of the Apocalypse is
   borrowed. "And the Lord," says he, ch. xi. 15, 16, "shall destroy (I
   should prefer, As the Lord has destroyed) the tongue of the Egyptian
   sea, and (I should prefer So) he shall lift up his hand upon the river,
   (Targum, the river Euphrates) with his mighty wind, (or Spirit) and
   shall smite it in the seven streams, so that men shall go over it
   dryshod." "And there shall be a highway for the remnant of my people
   which shall be from Assyria, (therefore the Euphrates is meant) as it
   was in the day when he came up from the laud of Egypt." Let the reader
   see Zach. x. 10, 11, and the Chaldee paraphrast thereon.

   But what then, shall we say, is this Euphrates, whose waters shall be
   dried up? Whether it is to be taken according to the letter, especially
   in that passage of Isaiah, I somewhat doubt. In the mean time, I rather
   think that something of parable and allegory is sprinkled through this
   part of the Apocalypse, but not much; so that the analogy of the other
   phials may remain here likewise, well adapted to the object of the
   effusion. For it seems we are to understand in the same manner as the
   old Euphrates had, the mystical one has its Babylon also. I think the
   Ottoman empire will be the only obstacle to those new enemies from the
   East, and a defence on the part of the beast. Nor will there be wanting
   an example from Isaiah himself, of Euphrates thus to be understood,
   who, ch. viii. v. 7, has described the Assyrian army, then a borderer
   on that river, under the similar allegory of the Euphrates. "The Lord
   will cause to come up against them (that is, the Syrians and the
   Israelites) the waters of the river, (so the Euphrates is accustomed to
   be called, kat' exochen,) strong and many, the king of Assyria, and all
   his glory," (Targum, his army.) Why should not the Euphrates of the
   phials be taken, by a parity of reason, for the Turks, not less than
   the Assyrians, borderers on the Euphrates, before its desication, nay,
   inhabitants of the same tract?

   . It contributes not a little to the establishment of this
   interpretation, that we explained the letting loose of that vast
   equestrian army, long bound on the great river Euphrates, at the
   sounding of the sixth trumpet, ch. ix. 15, as intended for the Turks,
   thence to be poured forth on the Roman world, while we were following
   the series of the trumpets, and the probable truth of the
   subject-matter. By the sixth phial, then, will this Euphratean flood be
   dried up. Evidently, according to what is said ch. xi. next after that
   destruction of the city to take place in the great earthquake, (which
   we have applied to the former phial,) the second woe, that is, the
   plague of the sixth phial, is to pass away. But we shall labour in vain
   in our conjectures concerning a thing which is wholly future, as to the
   means by which, or the authors by whom, it is to be effected; whether
   by the Jews themselves, (as Ezekiel, perhaps, intimates, ch. xxxviii.
   and xxxix.) taking possession of the Holy Land by restoration to their
   former state, or by some intestine dissension, opportunely preceding
   their return; or by both, perhaps, in successive order, or by some
   other cause.

   Whatever it may be, their obstruction being removed, the way of
   approach is by some means said to be prepared for these new Christians
   from the East, and that, as it appears, for the purpose of undertaking
   an expedition against the beast, to whose destruction all the phials
   are subservient. For whence otherwise, and for what reason, should such
   a trepidation and panic seize upon the followers of the beast, and even
   the demons themselves, from the time of the drying up of the. river, as
   to occasion such a horrible and unheard-of preparation for war as is
   here described; unless they, with the whole diabolical cohort, feared
   every extremity from the accession of the new kings of the East?
     __________________________________________________________________

   Phial the Seventh, in the Air.

   The seventh and last phial is poured out in the air; that is, on the
   power of the air, or Satan, comprehending and animating in its bosom,
   not only the dominions of the beast, but of all the enemies of Christ
   our Lord, in every part of the world.

   Now, as the beast drew from him spirit and life, even from his
   beginning, so the last fortunes of the bestial party will rely chiefly
   on their power and auspices, which may consist both in the array of so
   many confederates and auxiliaries, in the war of this last phial,
   collected together, as is related, by diabolical arts; and also from
   this circumstance, that the dragon, now Satan, not only intermeddles in
   their affairs by his vicars, the beast and false prophet, in levying
   this army of the habitable world, but that he by himself, in the last
   struggle of his reign, may appear to exercise his own proper and
   peculiar part; especially in calling forth those to a share in this
   war, upon whom otherwise the beast and false prophet could by no means
   have prevailed, either by authority or influence, or even perhaps by a
   representation of common danger.

   Against so many enemies, thus gathered together under the auspices of
   the power of the air, and enclosed as in a cage at Armageddon, the
   seventh phial will be discharged, no longer by a human hand, but with a
   celestial and fulminating vengeance; (for "it is the battle of the
   great day, and of God Almighty.") By this the ruin of the beast will be
   fully consummated; not of the seat only, or the city of Babylon, as
   before, under the fifth trumpet, but of the state itself; that is, of
   the Babylonian senate and people, wherever they shall be surviving
   after the destruction of the city, until the extermination of all the
   kings and states, who had hitherto committed fornication with idols and
   false deities, and of the rest of the tyrants, who opposed together the
   holy Church of Christ, shall be completely effected.

     __________________________________________________________________

  OF THE THOUSAND YEARS

   Of the Seventh Trumpet, and of the other Prophecies of wonderful Events
   contemporary with it.

   Here, Reader, I shall in a few words explain what my opinions are, nor
   will I much extend my observations on a subject, which was for a long
   time deemed incredible, on account of inveterate prejudices, and
   because it is one of the most abstruse and most remarkable of all the
   parts of prophetic Scripture. In so great a mystery, it will be
   sufficient to maintain the thing in a general manner, and not to
   inquire too curiously into the reasons of each particular part; lest
   while expatiating more freely than perhaps we ought, the saying of
   Solomon should ring in our ears,--"In the multitude of words there
   wanteth not sin."

   But with relation to this subject, it relies on the irrefragable chain
   of apocalyptical order, which I have demonstrated above; and the
   agreement of the other Scriptures, especially of the prophetical ones,
   wonderfully confirms the same. It was so looked forward to by
   Christians of the age next after the apostles, that Justin Martyr
   attests, not only that he himself believed it, but that it was believed
   with the fullest assent by those, who were at that time Christians of
   the orthodox persuasion, in all things. Which opinion of the first
   Christians, whether deformed by certain additions afterwards, or
   improperly or erroneously understood, (as I am inclined to believe,)
   their posterity after one or two ages rejected. To such a degree,
   however, was this carried by a progressive ardour of contention, (which
   you will justly be surprised at, and lament,) before the matter could
   be proved, that those who could not otherwise get rid of the force of
   the opposite opinion, built on the foundation of the Apocalypse, chose
   rather to call in question that most divine prophecy, signed and sealed
   by all the disciples of the apostles, and their immediate successors,
   nay, openly and audaciously to undervalue its authority on that subject
   by their invented presumptions, than to submit and yield themselves up
   to the force of conviction. Until at length, having contrived a
   commodious interpretation of that Millennium, (as they then imagined,)
   leaving the authority of the Apocalypse untouched, they desisted from
   an undertaking, not easily to be exempted from the crime of impiety,
   and to be dreaded by their posterity.

   But I, Reader, (no longer to detain you in the vestibule,) so explain
   the whole matter, as to show that I depart as little as possible from
   the received opinion of the day of Christ's advent, immediately to
   follow the ruin of Antichrist: Do thou, then, laying aside all
   prejudice, weigh the matter in the fear of God, and pardon me, if I
   fall into any error, with a charitable judgment. Thus, then, understand
   it.

   The seventh trumpet, with the whole thousand days, and the other
   oracles referring to the same, designate that great day of judgment,
   yvm dyn' rv', of the ancient Jewish Church, celebrated by Christ, and
   his apostles; not some short space of a few hours, (as is commonly
   believed,) but according to the custom of the Hebrews, using a day for
   time indefinitely, a continued space of many years, and circumscribed
   by two resurrections, as termini. A day, I say, beginning from that
   first partial, and as it may be termed, morning judgment of Antichrist,
   and of the other living enemies of the Church, by the glorious
   appearance of our Lord in a flame of fire, and finishing at length
   after the reign of a thousand years, granted to the new Jerusalem, his
   most holy spouse on this earth, and the total destruction of new
   enemies hereafter to arise, _when the great day is declining, and Satan
   again loosed, by the universal resurrect. tion and judgment of all the
   dead.. Which things being finished, the impious will be transferred to
   Gehenna, to be for ever tormented, but the saints to live eternally
   with Christ in heaven.

   This, in truth, is that time of the wrath of God against the nations,
   and of judging the cause of those who died for Christ's sake; at which,
   on the sound .of the seventh trumpet, the elders rejoice with triumph,
   because by that God would surely "give reward unto his servants the
   prophets, and to the saints, and to them that fear his name, both small
   and great, and would destroy them that destroy the earth."

   This is "that day of judgment, and perdition of ungodly men," of which
   St. Peter having spoken in his 2d Epistle, c. iii. v. 7. immediately
   subjoins, "But beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day
   is with the Lord as a thou sand years, and a thousand years as one
   day." in which same day, indeed, the apostle with his brethren and
   fellow-countrymen, looks for that new appearance of things to come, of
   which he afterwards says, "But we, according to his promise, look for
   new heavens, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness." Mark!
   "according to his promise." But when and where was this promise to be
   found of new heavens and a new earth, (before John had yet seen the
   Apocalypse) unless in Isaiah, ch. lxv. 17, and lxvi. 22? Which promise,
   I should certainly be surprised, if he who had read, could imagine was
   to be fulfilled any where else than in the present world.

   This is that kingdom also, conjoined with the appearance of Christ to
   judge the world, to which St. Paul alludes in his second Epistle to
   Timothy, ch. iv. v. 1, "I adjure thee before God, and our Lord Jesus
   Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and
   kingdom." For after the last, and universal resurrection, from the same
   authority, 1 Corinthians, c. xv. Christ, after death, the last enemy,
   has been destroyed, will deliver up the kingdom to the Father, that he
   may be subject to him who put all things under him. But it is not said
   that any new kingdom is to commence at that time. The kingdom, then,
   which is to come, which is neither before the appearance of our Lord
   nor after the last resurrection, must necessarily be included between
   both. This is that kingdom which Daniel saw, of the Son of man, when
   the times of the antichristian horn being completed, or "the times of
   the Gentiles being fulfilled," (Luke, ch. xxi. 24,) he should appear in
   the clouds of heaven, when there shall be given to him power, and
   glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and tongues, should
   serve him, or when (as the angel soon after explains it,) "The kingdom,
   power, and greatness of the kingdom, under the whole heaven, shall be
   given to the people of the saints of the Most High." Dan. ch. vii. 13,
   14, also 18, 22, 26, 27. For, as I have just now observed, this kingdom
   is not to be after the last resurrection, since at that time the
   kingdom is not to be entered upon by the Son of Man, but, as St. Paul
   testifies, to be laid down, and delivered up to the Father. Now as
   that, the same kingdom, is treated of in both places, as well by John
   as by Daniel, may be proved from these two arguments. That both begin
   from the same terminus, namely, from the extermination of the fourth,
   or Roman beast. That of Daniel, when the beast who acts under the last
   government of "the horn with eyes," was given to be slain, and "his
   body delivered to the burning flame," Dan. ch. vii. v. 11, 12. 26. That
   of the Apocalypse, when the beast and false prophet, (that wicked horn
   of Daniel, having a mouth and eyes like a man) "were taken, and both
   cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone." Secondly, it
   may be proved from the same session of judgment preceding both. For
   that the one is borrowed from the other, and that both, altogether,
   refer to the same event, will appear from the collation of the words in
   the description of each.

   DANIEL, CH. VII. APOCALYPSE, CH. XX. 4.
   Ver. 9. I beheld till thrones were set [66] , And I saw thrones,
   Ver. 10. And the judgment was set [67] , And they sat on them,

   Ver. 22. And judgment was given to the saints of the Most High [68] ;

   And judgment was given to them.

   And the saints possessed the kingdom [69] .

   And the saints lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.

   Moreover, I wish to give the reader this admonition: Whatever sound
   doctrine, generally speaking, is delivered by the Jews, whatever by our
   Lord in the Gospel, or in any part of the New Testament by the
   apostles, relative to the day of the great judgment, is drawn from this
   vision of Daniel, namely, the judgment to be perfected by
   fire--Christ's coming in the clouds of heaven,--coming in the glory of
   the Father, with a multitude of angels,--the saints, who are to judge
   the world, with him,--Antichrist to be destroyed at the brightness of
   his appearance, &c. So that they who endeavour to throw down the column
   of evangelical faith, concerning the glorious advent of Christ,
   neglecting the ancient tradition of the Church, must labour to transfer
   that prophecy to some other event.

   Lastly, that I may come to a conclusion:--This is that most ample
   kingdom, which, according to Daniel's interpretation, was foreshown to
   Nebuchadnezzar in the statue, predictive of four kingdoms. Not that of
   the stone cut out of the mountain, while the series of the monarchies
   was still subsisting; (for that is the present state of Christ's
   kingdom;) but of the stone when the same monarchies were utterly broken
   in pieces and destroyed, which became a great mountain, and filled the
   whole world.

   On these subjects, Reader, I have treated, but not asserted any thing
   rashly. I humbly refer the whole matter to be judged of by the Church,
   from the word of God,--to whose judgment, as it is fit, I willingly
   submit my opinion concerning this mystery.

  A REMARKABLE PASSAGE

   From a Dialogue between Justin Martyr, and Trypho, a Jew, respecting
   the Millennium, or the Thousand Years of the kingdom of Christ,
   corrected and illustrated by Notes.

  TRYPHO.

   Now tell me the truth. Do you expect and confess, that this place,
   Jerusalem, is at length to be re-established, and your people to be
   collected together, and brought out with joy, together with Christ, and
   the patriarchs, and the prophets, and with these who are of our race,
   or even some of those who were proselytes before the coming of Christ?
   Or do you go to such a length, as to confess these things, that you may
   appear to exceed us in doubtful questions?

  JUSTIN.

   I am not reduced to such straits, O Trypho, as to speak differently
   from what I think. I have already confessed to you, and before also,
   that I, and indeed many others with me, believe that it will come to
   pass, as you fully know. But on the contrary, I have signified to thee,
   that many who are [not [70] ] of the pure and pious sentiment of
   Christians do not acknowledge this; for I pointed out to thee those who
   are called Christians, but are atheists, and impious heretics, because
   they teach all manner of blasphemous, impious, and foolish doctrines.
   But that you may know that I say this not only among you, I shall
   compose a work, as soon as I can, of these our disputations; wherein I
   shall insert, that I profess this very doctrine, which I acknowledge in
   your presence. For I am determined to follow, not men and human
   doctrines, but God, and the instruction delivered by him. For although
   you have had a verbal communication with some who are called
   Christians, and do not confess this, but dare to speak evil of the God
   of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and who say
   that there is no resurrection of the dead, but that as soon as they
   die, their souls are received into heaven, do not suppose that these
   are Christians; since, if any one think rightly, he would not say that
   the Sadducees were Jews, nor similar heretics of the Genistæ, and
   Meristæ, and Galileans, and Hellenists, and baptised Pharisees (not to
   tire you with hearing all I think); but those who were indeed called
   Jews, and sons of Abraham, and who confessed God with their lips, but
   their hearts (as God himself exclaims,) were far from him.

   "Ego de kai ei tines eisin orthegemones kata panta Christianoi."

   "But I and all Christians, who are of the orthodox opinion," both
   acknowledge that there will be a resurrection of the flesh, and a
   thousand years' (reign) in Jerusalem, renewed, and adorned, and
   enlarged, as the prophets Ezekiel and Isaiah and others declare [71] .

   For thus .Esaias speaks of the time of those thousand years, (Isa. c.
   lxv. v. 17, &c.) "For there shall be a new heaven, and a new earth, and
   the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. They shall find
   joy and exultation in .that which I create. For, behold, I make [for]
   Jerusalem an exultation, and [for] my people a joy," &c. to the end of
   the chapter.

   But, as to that expression, "For according to the days of the tree of
   life [72] , are the days of my people," he subjoins, "In these words we
   understand the thousand years to be mysteriously signified." For as it
   was said to Adam, in the day in which he should eat of the tree, he
   should die, we know that he did not complete a thousand years. We know
   likewise (he proceeds,) that saying, that "the day of the Lord is as a
   thousand years," relates to this subject.

   And a certain man among us, whose name is John, one of the twelve
   apostles of Christ, in that Revelation which was exhibited to him,
   prophesied that those of us who were faithful followers of Christ,
   should pass a thousand years in Jerusalem, and afterwards should be the
   universal, and (to say it at once) the eternal resurrection of all
   together, and the judgment, in which our Lord also said, that "they
   should neither marry nor be given in marriage, but be equal to the
   angels,--being the children of God, as of the resurrection." For we
   have prophetic gifts still existing among us up to the present time,
   &c.

   Another Passage referring to the same subject.

   After a Discourse on the great Day of Judgment, (which he calls ten
   megalen hemeran tes kriseos,) when the Jews should have mourned for
   Christ, whom they pierced, and when Christ himself, inaugurated after
   the order of Melchisedech, should have become the judge of quick and,
   dead, he immediately subjoins, "At whose second coming, do not imagine
   that Esaias, or the other prophets inform us, that sacrifices of blood
   or of libations were to be offered upon the altar, but true and
   spiritual praises and, thanksgivings.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [70] Mede has a note to allow that the negative ought here to be

   [71] Note by Mede.] If you except the principal articles of faith, I
   know not whether a similar testimony can be found to any Christian
   dogma. It is a great previous argument in its favour, that all the
   orthodox thought the same in the age next to the apostles. Justin
   became a Christian about thirty years after the death of St. John, in
   which time it is very probable many were alive who had heard the
   apostles teach.

   [72] In the Hebrew it is simply hts, but the Septuagint has tou xulou
   tes zoes, to which the Chaldee paraphrase assents. Justin seems to have
   thought that the life resulting from the tree of life, or of man in the
   state of Paradise, would have been a thousand years, then to have been
   translated into a happier state and condition. But in consequence of
   Adam's sin, neither he nor any of his posterity attained that number of
   years, but died within that great day.--Mede.

THE OPINIONS

   Of the Hebrew Doctors on the great Day of Judgment, and of the Reign of
   the Messiah then to come.

   Carpentarius, in his Commentary on the Alcinous of Plato, p. 322,
   asserts, that "the seventh millenary was called, by the whole school of
   the Cabalists, the great day of judgment, because then they think that
   God will judge the souls of all."

   He means, by the name of Cabalists, (if I am not mistaken,) the
   Talmudic doctors, according to whom, in more than one author, that
   tradition is found to be recorded. For thus it is read in the Gemara
   Sanhedrim, Perek Chelek--R. Ketina has said, "The world subsists for
   six thousand years, and will be destroyed in one, of which it is said,
   And the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.' "But he understands
   the destruction which is to come, will be by fire, by which the world
   being refined, will be purified like gold, and will be delivered from
   subjection to the curse under which it now groans on account of man,
   into the glorious liberty of the sons of God, Rom. ch. viii. It follows
   a little after, in conformity with the tradition of R. Ketina, "As out
   of seven years, every seventh year is the year of remission, so out of
   the seven thousand years of the world, the seventh millenary will be
   the millenary of remission, as it is said, And the Lord alone shall be
   exalted, in that day.' It is said also in the 92d Psalm, a Psalm or
   Song for the Sabbath-day, that is, of the day of perfect rest. It is
   also said, Psalm xc. For a thousand years in thy sight are but as
   yesterday.'"

   Here the Reader may remark two things:--First, that the ancient Jews
   understood that prophecy of Isaiah, ch. ii. where these words, "And the
   Lord alone shall be exalted in that day," occur twice,--of the day of
   the great judgment, and of the reign of Christ, from whose footsteps
   the succeeding Rabbins do not depart. "In that day,' that is, the day
   of judgment," says R. Schelomo. Also, "When he shall have risen to
   consume the earth, that is," says he, "in the day of judgment, in which
   the Lord shall consume the wicked of the earth," R. David Kimschi says,
   "In that day, that is, in the days of the Messiah, when God shall
   execute judgment on the wicked." And again, "And the Lord alone shall
   be exalted in that day, is the same as if he had said, The Lord shall
   be King over all the earth." Another thing to be remarked is, that the
   title of the 92d Psalm was thought by those Hebrew masters to have
   respect to the subject of the Psalm, and that it ought to be understood
   of the Sabbatism of a thousand years.

   Now, from these premises I am decidedly of opinion, that the ancient
   Jews explained the day which they denominated the day of judgment as
   the MILLENNIUM; which is more fully confirmed from Misdrachtchillim,
   upon that passage of the 90th Psalm, "Comfort us now, for the days for
   which thou hast afflicted us," viz. says he, "in Babylon, in Greece,
   and under the Romans, and that in the days of the Messiah." And how
   many are the days of the Messiah? Jehosuah said that they are two
   thousand years, as it is written according to the days; that is,
   according to, or during, two days; for one day of the holy and blessed
   God is a thousand years, according to that saying, For a thousand years
   are in thy sight but as yesterday.'" The masters also say, that the age
   to come (en oikoumene te mellouse Heb. ch. ii. 5.) will be one day of
   the Messiah. For the holy and blessed God, in the age to come, will
   make for himself one day, of which it is said in Zechariah, ch. xiv.
   "And there shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord, not day
   nor night [73] . And it shall come to pass that at even time it shall
   be light." This day is the age to come, and the revival of the dead:
   But in what millenary that was to come, they did not agree among
   themselves, and neither did that opinion of the seventh satisfy all.
   There were some, and not of inferior authority, who understood it of
   the sixth, as the house of Elias, whose tradition respecting the
   millennium of the great judgment is extant in these words: "The just,
   whom God will raise again, (namely, at the first resurrection [74] ,)
   will not again be reduced to dust. But if you inquire of those thousand
   years in which the blessed God will renew the world, of which it is
   said, And the Lord alone will be exalted in that day,' what will become
   of the just? Be it known, that the holy and blessed God will give them
   wings like eagles, that they may fly upon the face of the waters whence
   it is said, Psalm xlvi. 3, Therefore will we not fear when the earth
   shall be changed.' Perhaps you will say, it must be an affliction to
   them. But then occurs that passage in Isaiah, ch. xl. 31, They that
   wait on the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with
   wings as eagles.'" The same tradition, however, asserts, that the world
   shall not last more than six thousand years. For thus runs the
   tradition: "The world endures six thousand years; two thousand
   emptiness, two thousand years the Law; and lastly, two thousand years
   the day of Christ." One of which millenaries, therefore, according to
   this opinion, would be that great day of which it is said, "And the
   Lord alone shall be exalted in that day." The same was the opinion of
   Rabbi Asche, the son of R. Abbas, as it is there expressly said,
   namely, from the opinion of Chanan, son of Thahaliphas, that the holy
   and blessed God would not renew his world till the seventh millenary.
   But R. Asche had said, that it would be after the fifth millenary.

   What, moreover, in addition, the Jewish masters thought concerning the
   reign of the Messiah in that great day to come, may be known in some
   measure from what I now subjoin. In the summaries of the great Rabbi
   Eleazar, (who lived a little after the second temple,) it is said, "As
   I live, saith the Lord, I will raise you up in time to come, in the
   resurrection of the dead, and I will gather you together with all
   Israel in the land of Israel." Petrus Galat. lib. xii. c. 1.

   So likewise the paraphrast Jonathan, (who lived before Christ,) on the
   xivth of Hosea, 4 to 9, "They shall be gathered out of the midst of
   their captivity; they shall dwell under the shadow of their Christ; and
   the dead shall live, and good things shall grow up out of the earth,
   and there shall be a memorial of their goodness bearing fruit, and
   never failing, just as the remembrance of the sound of trumpets over
   the old wine, which used to be poured out in libation on the
   sanctuary."

   Targum on Ps. 1. v. 3. The just shall say in the day of the great
   judgment, "Our God shall come and shall not keep silence, to execute
   vengeance for his people."

   R. Saadas (one of those doctors whom they call eminent,) on that
   passage of Daniel, c. vii. v. 10, "And the judgment was set, and the
   books were opened," says, "That is the day of judgment, as it is
   written, Mal. c. iv. 1, Behold, the day cometh burning as a
   furnace.'--And the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment,' Isa. c.
   v. ver. 16.--and also, Wherefore wait ye for me, saith the Lord.' That
   is the great day when the Lord shall arise to judgment." And a little
   after he says, "Know that with relation to what I quoted, The judgment
   sat, and the books were opened,' I expounded it above of the day of
   judgment, and the day of visitation; (Wisdom c. vii. v. 7 and 13.) that
   is, the day to come, when inquiry shall be made into every work of the
   sons of men, as well the living as the dead." The same observes on v.
   18, "And the saints of the most high God shall take the kingdom."
   Because the Israelites rebelled against the Lord, their kingdom shall
   be taken from them, and shall be given to those four monarchies, which
   shall possess the kingdom in that age, and shall lead them captive, and
   shall subdue Israel to themselves, until the age to come, when the
   Messiah shall reign.

   Compare Luke c. xxi. v. 24, &c. The Jews shall be led captive into all
   nations, and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles, until the
   time of the Gentiles be fulfilled. "Then shall they see the Son of man
   coming in a cloud," &c. And that of Tertullian against Marcion, lib. v.
   c. 10. "Christ, the High Priest of the circumcised priesthood, when at
   length it shall come to pass, that the circumcision and the people of
   Abraham acknowledge him, shall be deemed worthy of acceptance and
   benediction." To this agrees what is contained in the book of
   Berachoth, lib. xi. c. 1. on the faith of Peter the Galatian, and is
   thus read: "Ben Zuma said, It will come to pass, that Israel will not
   mention of the coming up out of the land of Egypt in the age to come,
   and in the days of the Messiah. And what is the proof of this? Because
   it is written, Jer. c. xxiii. "Behold, the days come, when they shall
   no longer say, The Lord lived], who caused the children of Israel to
   conic up out of the land of Egypt," &c. The wise men have said, not
   that the name of Egypt should be extirpated from its place, but that
   the wonderful things which shall come to pass in the days of those
   kingdoms, that is, when the Messiah shall destroy the kingdoms of the
   world, will be the chief in their estimation, and Egypt will be but
   secondary. From these and similar sayings, the reader may learn "why
   Jerome so often reproaches Judaism for its millenaries which indeed he
   does so studiously, that this may appear to have been the triumphant
   argument by which he would prove the error of that dogma. But however
   it may be with the dogma, and whether these fathers judged advisedly or
   not, to think with the Jews is not always to be imputed as a fault. .
   Otherwise, why do we not likewise explode the age to come, Gehenna,
   Paradise? For do not we Christians hold these in common with the Jews?
   Why should we not then receive those expressions of the kingdom of the
   heavens, and the day of judgment, delivered down from the Jewish
   masters? For where can they find those in the canon of the Old
   Testament, which however are very common among the doctors of the Jews?
   Besides, who now, after having heard the opinion of the ancient Hebrews
   concerning the thousand years of the day of judgment, would not
   immediately find himself induced to believe that the apostle Peter in
   his dissertation about the day of judgment, with the same people, (for
   both his Epistles were addressed to the Jews,) and immediately
   subjoining to it, "Be not ignorant of this, that one day is with the
   Lord as a thousand years," meant to confirm the tradition of the rabbis
   upon this very point? Especially since those words seem not to be
   borrowed from the Psalms, (as is generally supposed,) but from the
   common formula of the Jews, when speaking of that day. Nay, he will
   moreover reflect, that unless Christ our Lord and his apostles had made
   such frequent use of the expression of the day of judgment, derived
   from the Jewish masters, in the same sense as themselves, why do they
   never point it out by a single word? For is it not a very dangerous
   thing, nay, a mode liable to deceive, to apply the words and phrases of
   those who are in error in the course of doctrine, without any caution
   or remark that they are used in a different sense?

   Such being the case, I leave to those who are able to judge of
   mysteries of this kind in theology, to consider whether this would be
   the best and easiest method of acting with the Jews; not that those
   very clear prophecies of events in the second and glorious advent of
   Christ, should be wrested by application to the first, but that they
   should be persuaded that no other Messiah is to be expected by them,
   who will fulfil all those things; mutatis mutandis however, (for the
   Christian is not here to be precisely of .the same opinion with the
   Jews, but to be guided by the measure of Christian faith,) no other
   than Jesus of Nazareth, whom their ancestors crucified, as the
   Apocalypse every where so earnestly inculcates. "Behold," says its
   author, just after its commencement, "Jesus Christ, the first born from
   the dead, who loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,
   behold, he cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him, even they
   who pierced him, and all the kindreds of the earth shall wail because
   of him. I am A and O, the First and the Last, saith the Lord, which is,
   and which was, and which is to come." Also he attributes that august
   kingdom every where to the Lamb, that is, to Jesus Christ who was
   slain; as ch. vii. of the multitude bearing palms, "The Lamb shall feed
   them," &c.; c. xvii. v. 14, "The Lamb shall subdue them, because he is
   King of kings, and Lord of lords;" c. xix. v: 7. "The marriage of the
   Lamb is come;" c. xxi. v. 9. of the New Jerusalem, "I will show you the
   spouse of the Lamb;" and v. 23. "The Lamb is the light thereof," &c.
   For while we wrest those very clear prophecies of events relative to
   the second coming of Christ, and apply them to the first, the Jews hold
   us in derision, and are more confirmed in their infidelity. This method
   of converting the Jews, unless I am much deceived, the apostle Peter
   pursued, Acts c. iii. v. 19. "Repent ye," says he, "and be converted,
   that your sins may be blotted out, and that [75] the times of
   refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord; and that he may send
   Jesus Christ, who was before preached unto you, whom the heavens must
   receive till the time of the restitution of all things, which God has
   spoken by the mouths of all his holy prophets, since the world began."

   "Prove all things. Hold fast that which is good." 1 Thess. c. v. ver.
   21.

   "To our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, be glory both now and to the day
   of the age. Amen [76] ." 2 Peter c. iii. last verse.
