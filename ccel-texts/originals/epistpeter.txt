THE POSSIBILITIES AND DYNAMICS OF THE REGENERATE LIFE

  1 Peter i. 3-5

   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according
   to His great mercy begat us again unto a living hope by the
   resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, unto an inheritance
   incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in
   heaven for you, who by the power of God are guarded through faith unto
   a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.

   How easily these early disciples break into doxology! Whenever some
   winding in the way of their thought brings the grace of God into view,
   the song leaps to their lips. The glory of grace strikes the chords of
   their hearts into music, and life resounds with exuberant praise. It is
   a stimulating research to study the birthplaces of doxologies in the
   apostolic writings. Sometimes the march of an argument is stayed while
   the doxology is sung. Sometimes the Te Deum is heard in the midst of a
   procession of moral maxims. The environment of the doxology varies, but
   the operative cause which gives it birth is ever the same. From the
   height of some ascending argument, or through the lens of some ethical
   maxim, the soul catches a glimpse of the "riches of His grace," and the
   wonderful vision moves it to inevitable and immediate praise. I am not
   surprised, therefore, to find the doxology forming the accompaniment of
   a passage which contemplates the glory and the privileges of the
   re-created life. It is a Te Deum sung during the unveiling of the
   splendours of redeeming grace. Let us turn our eyes to the vision which
   has aroused the grateful song.

   "Blessed be the God and Father . . . who begat us again." [Verse 3]
   "Begat again." That is one of the unique phrases of the Christian
   vocabulary. It is not to be found in systems of thought which are alien
   from the Christian religion. It is not to be found in the vocabulary of
   any of the modern schools which are severed from the facts and forces
   of the Christian faith. The emphasis of their teaching gathers round
   about terms of quite a different order, such as culture, training,
   discipline, education, evolution. The Christian religion has also much
   to say about the process of evolution. It dwells at length upon the
   ministries of "growth," "training," "increasing," "putting on,"
   "perfecting." But while it emphasises "growth," it directs our
   attention to "birth." While it magnifies the necessity of wise culture,
   it proclaims the necessity of good seed. So while the Bible lags behind
   no school in urging the importance of liberal culture, it stands alone
   in proclaiming the necessity of right germs. You cannot by culture
   develop the thorn-bush into a ladened vine. You cannot by the most
   exquisite discipline evolve "the natural man" into the "measure of the
   stature of the fulness of Christ." If we had merely to do with
   perverted growths, then the trainer and pruner might twist the crooked
   straight. But we are confronted with more than perverted growths; we
   have to do with corrupt and rotting seed. If all we needed was the
   purification of our conditions, then the City Health Department might
   lead us into holiness. But we need more than the enrichment of the
   soil; we need the revitalising of the seed. And so the Christian
   religion raises the previous question. It begins its ministry at a
   stage prior to the process of evolution. It discourses on births and
   generation, on seeds and germs, and proclaims as its primary postulate,
   "Except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."

   Now, man is not enamoured of that dogmatic postulate. It smites his
   pride in the forehead. It lays himself and his counsels in the dust. It
   expresses itself in an alien speech. Men are familiar with the word
   "educate"; the alien word is "regenerate." Political controversy has
   familiarised them with the word "reform"; the alien word is
   "transfigure." They have made a commonplace of the word "organise"; the
   alien word is "vitalise." They have made almost a fetish of the phrase
   "moral growth"; the alien word is "new birth." And so we do not like
   the strange and humbling postulate; but whether we like it or not, the
   heart of every man bears witness to the truth and necessity of its
   imperative demand. Man be comes incredulous of the necessity of the new
   birth when he surveys the lives of others, but not when he contemplates
   his own. We gaze upon the conduct and behaviour of some man who is
   dissociated from the Christian Church, or who indeed is hostile or
   indifferent to the Christian faith. "We mark the integrity of his walk,
   the seemliness of his behaviour, the purity of all his relationships,
   the evident loftiness of his ideals, and we then project the sceptical
   inquiry, Does this man need to be begotten again? I do not accept one
   man's judgment as to the necessity of another man's regeneration. I
   wish to hear a man's judgment concerning himself. I would like a man to
   be brought face to face with the life of Jesus, with all its searching
   and piercing demands, and with all its marvellous ideals, so
   marvellously attained, and I would like the man's own judgment as to
   what would be required before he himself, in the most secret parts of
   his life, is clothed in the same superlative glory. I think it is
   impossible to meet with a single unconverted man who does not know
   that, if ever he is to wear the glory of the Son of God, and to be
   chaste and illumined in his most hidden thoughts and dispositions,
   there will have to take place some marvellous and inconceivable
   transformation. Let any man gaze long on "the unsearchable riches of
   Christ," and then let him slowly and deliberately take the inventory of
   his own life, and I am persuaded he will come to regard the vaunted
   panaceas of the world as altogether secondary, he will relegate its
   vocabulary to the secondary, and he will welcome as the only pertinent
   and adequate speech, "Ye must be born again."

   Into what manner of life are we begotten again? What is the range of
   its possibilities, and the spaciousness of its prospects? The apostolic
   doxology winds its way among a wealth of unveiled glories.

   "Blessed be the God . . . who begat us again unto a living hope."
   [Verse 3] It is a hope affluent in life, It is a vivifying hope. There
   are hopes that are inoperative, ineffective, uninfluential. They
   generate no energy. They impart no power to work the mill. But the
   spiritual hope of the redeemed is living and life-creating, operating
   as a vital stimulus upon the consecrated race. How the Bible exults in
   the use of this great characteristic word: "Living Bread!" "Living
   Water!" "Living Fountains!" "The Living God!" The word conveys the
   suggestion of superabundant life, exuberant energy, an over flowing
   vitality. It quickens the sentiments. "We rejoice in hope." The
   dispositions dance in the radiant light! It vitalises the thought. The
   mind which is inspired by the glorious expectation is grandly secure
   against the encroachment of the evil one. Hope-inspired thought is its
   own defence. It energises the will. The great hope feeds the will,
   vivifies it, makes it steadfast and unmovable. Into all this powerful
   hope are we begotten again by the abundant mercy of God.

   "Begat us again . . . unto an inheritance." [Verse 4] With our
   regeneration we become heirs to a glorious spiritual estate, with all
   its inexhaustible possessions and treasures. How the apostles roll out
   the New Testament music by ringing the changes upon this eagerly
   welcomed word! "Heirs of salvation!" "Heirs of the kingdom!" "Heirs
   together of the grace of life!" "Heirs according to the hope of eternal
   life!" The apostles survey their estate from different angles, that
   they may comprehend the wealth of the vast inheritance. With what
   fruitful words does the Apostle Peter characterise the nature of these
   possessions! It is an inheritance "incorruptible." It is beyond the
   reach of death. No grave is ever dug on this estate. It is an
   inheritance "undefiled." It is beyond the taint of sin. No
   contamination ever stains its driven snow. The robes of the glorified
   are whiter than snow. It is an inheritance "that fadeth not away." It
   is beyond the blight of change. The leaf never turns. "Time does not
   breathe on its fadeless bloom." Into this glorious inheritance are we
   begotten again by the abundant mercy of God.

   "Begat us again . . . unto a salvation ready to be revealed in the last
   time." [Verse 5] Here conies in the graciousness of spiritual
   evolution. All the steps on the work of salvation are "ready," right
   away to the ultimate consummation. There has been no caprice in the
   arrangements. There need be no uncertainty in the expectations. There
   has been no defect in the preparations. There is no lack in the
   resources. What is needed for the ripening of the redeemed character
   has been provided. At every step of the way "all things are ready." The
   glorious possibilities range from the seed to the "full corn in the
   ear"; from the new birth to the "salvation ready to be revealed in the
   last time." Such is the inspiring prospect, and such are some of the
   glorious possibilities of the redeemed and re-created life.

   "We have searched this glowing doxology for glimpses of the
   new-begotten life. We have gazed upon its fascinating range of
   possibilities. Has it any suggestion to offer of the dynamics by which
   these alluring possibilities may be achieved? I have already dwelt upon
   the vitalising energy which flows from its living hope. Are there other
   suggestions of empowering dynamics by which even the loftiest spiritual
   height may be scaled? Let us glance at some of these suggested powers.

   "According to His great mercy." [Verse 3] I am glad and grateful that
   the pregnant passage is prefaced by this word. The regenerated soul is
   just enveloped in "great mercy." Now mercy implies sympathy. "We cannot
   have mercy without sympathy. "Without mercy we cannot have leniency;
   but leniency is only thin, pinched fruit compared with the fat, juicy
   fruit of mercy. "Without sympathy we may have giving, but unsympathetic
   giving is like the cold, outer threshold, while mercy is like a glowing
   hearthstone. Mercy implies sympathy. Go a step further. Sympathy
   suggests the choicest companionship, the rarest of all fellowships.
   Where there is true sympathy, there is the most exquisite
   companionship. If, then, our God and Father enswathes us in "great
   mercy," He visits in the sweetest fellowships. Therefore in the
   redeemed life there can be no loneliness, for in the Father's presence
   all possible loneliness is destroyed. The mercy which implies
   companionship accompanies me as a dynamic from my faintest breathing as
   a babe-Christian on to the consummation when I shall have become a
   full-grown man in Christ.

   "Begat us again . . . by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
   dead." [Verse 3] His resurrection opens to me the doors of the immortal
   life. If He had not risen, my hope had never been born. The breaking up
   of His grave means the breaking up of man's winter, and the soft
   approach of the eternal spring. Because He has risen, death no longer
   counts! That Life, which in death defeated death, and converted "the
   place of a skull" into the altar of the people's hope, is the dynamic
   of the regenerate soul, and makes the life invulnerable.

   "By the power of God guarded unto salvation." [Verse 5] Here is another
   aspect of the gracious energy which enables me to convert possibilities
   into achievements. I am "guarded." The "power of God" defends me, hems
   me in, and secures me from every assault. My Father's power is my
   garrison. He engirdles me, like a defensive army occupying a city wall,
   and makes me invincible against the menace and attacks of the devil.
   "As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about
   His people." Such are the adequate resources, and such the wonderful
   equipments of the regenerate life. The land that stretches before us is
   glorious. The power to possess it is equally glorious. They may both be
   ours "by faith."

SORROWFUL, YET ALWAYS REJOICING

   1 Peter i. 6, 7

   Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be,
   ye have been put to grief in manifold trials, that the proof of your
   faith, being more precious than gold that perisheth though it is proved
   by fire, might be found unto praise and glory and honour at the
   revelation of Jesus Christ.

   "WHEREIN ye greatly rejoice!" These fountains of spiritual joy shoot
   into the light at most startling and unexpected places. Their favourite
   haunt seems to be the heart of the desert. They are commonly associated
   with a land of drought. In these Scriptural records I so often find the
   fountain bursting through the sand, the song lifting its pæan out of
   the night. If the text is a well of cool and delicious water, the
   context is frequently and waste. "Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though
   now . . . ye have been put to grief." [verse 6] A present rejoicing set
   in the midst of an environing grief! A profound and refreshing
   satisfaction, even when the surface of the life is possessed by
   drought! I never expected to find a fountain in so unpromising a waste.
   "Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall
   say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice!" Who
   ever expected to find a well in that Sahara? As I trod the hot burning
   sands of "reviling" and "persecuting" and false accusing, little did I
   anticipate en countering a fountain of spiritual delight. Let us once
   again contemplate the strange conjunction. "Woe unto thee, Bethsaida!
   Woe unto thee, Chorazin! Woe unto thee, Capernaum!" This on the one
   hand. And on the other hand, "A certain lawyer stood up, and tempted
   Him." And between the two, "Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit." Again, I
   say, I am amazed at the setting. If life were a prolonged
   marriage-feast, one might anticipate hearing the happy bells at every
   corner of the way; but to hear the joyous peal in the hour of grievous
   midnight and eclipse arrests the heart in keen and strained surprise.
   "These things have I said unto you, that My joy may be in you." "My
   joy!" And yet Calvary loomed only a hand's-breadth off, just
   twenty-four hours away! I thought the joy bells might have been heard
   away back in Nazareth, in the beauty and serenity of a secluded village
   life, or on some quiet evening, with His friends on the Galilean lake;
   but I never anticipated hearing them at Calvary's base, in full view of
   shame and crucifixion. "My joy!" "One of you shall betray Me." It is a
   marvellous conjunction, but one which is almost a commonplace in the
   Christian Scriptures. "They received the word in much affliction, with
   joy in the Holy Ghost." It is a mysterious, yet glorious wedlock.
   "Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now . . . ye have been put to
   grief." What is the suggestion of this apparently forced and
   incongruous union? The suggestion is this, that the spiritual joy of
   the redeemed life is continuous, and is not conditioned by the changing
   moods of the transient day. Spiritual delights are not dried up when I
   pass into the seasons of material drought. When the shadows settle down
   upon my life, and my experiences darken into night, the night is not to
   be without its cheery and illuminating presence. The place of the
   midnight is to be as "the land of the midnight sun." There shall be
   light enough to enable me to read the promises, to see my way, and to
   perceive the gracious presence of my Lord. "He that followeth Me shall
   not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life." Therefore the
   shadow need not annihilate my joy. My temporary grief need not expunge
   my spiritual delights. The funeral knell of bereavement may be tolling
   in the outer rooms of the life, while in the most secret places may be
   heard the joy bells of trustful communion with God. "Wherein ye greatly
   rejoice, though now . . . ye have been put to grief."

   "Wherein ye greatly rejoice." [Verse 6] If our spiritual joy is to be
   continuous and persuasive, sending its pure vitalising ray even through
   the season of grief, we shall have to see to it that it is adequately
   nourished and sustained. Now, the nutriment of joy is to be found in
   appropriate thought. Happiness is usually the resultant of sensations,
   the ephemeral product of sensationalisms, having the uncertain life of
   the things on which it depends. Joy is the product of deep, quiet,
   steady, appropriate thought. Thought provides the oxygen in which the
   bright, cheery flame of love is sustained. What kind of thought is
   required? "Wherein ye rejoice"! In what? The rejoicing emerges from an
   atmosphere of thought--the thought which is contained in the previous
   verses, and which formed the basis of our last exposition. It is a
   contemplation of the possibilities and dynamics of the redeemed life.
   The possibilities stretch away in a most glorious and alluring
   panorama: "a living hope"; "an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled,
   and that fadeth not away"; "a salvation ready to be revealed in the
   last time." The dynamics are no less wealthy than the prospects: the
   "great mercy" of the Father; "the resurrection of Jesus from the dead";
   "the power" of the Holy Ghost! These constitute the oxygenating thought
   of the Christian redemption. If the soul be immersed in it, faint
   sparks will be kindled into fervent flames, and timid desires will be
   strengthened into confident rejoicing. "As I mused, the fire burnt."
   Let mind and heart make their home in the spacious thoughts of God, and
   there will be born in the life a moral and spiritual glow which will
   not be chilled by any transient cloud, nor extinguished by the storms
   of the most tempestuous night. "Wherein ye greatly rejoice."

   "Though now for a little while, if need be, ye have been put to grief
   in manifold trials." [Verse 6] The "manifold trials" "will come.
   Antagonisms may rush down upon us from north, south, east, and west,
   and may twist and wrench our lives into strange bewilderments, and yet
   the continuous thread of spiritual rejoicing need never be broken. Our
   affairs may be tossed into incredible complications, and yet "the joy
   of the Lord may be our strength." The pleasing air of music, which in
   its simplicity a child might hum, may appear to be lost as it passes
   into the maze of tortuous variations and complications, but an expert
   ear can detect the continuity of the primal air beneath all the
   accretions of the voluminous sound. The air of simple spiritual
   rejoicing, which may be clearly heard when life is plain and serene,
   may be continued when life becomes complex and burdened, torn and
   harassed by "manifold trials." We may still hear the sweet primitive
   air of Christian rejoicing. I am not surprised to hear the sounds of
   rejoicing from Paul's life, when he was holding precious and sanctified
   intercourse with such beloved friends as Prisca and Aquila. But when
   the apostle is "put to grief through manifold trials," and life becomes
   dark, heavy, and complicated, how will it fare with him then? "The
   gaoler thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in
   the stocks. And it came to pass that at the midnight"--that is what I
   want to know about--"at the midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang
   praises unto God." It is the old air, rising through the pains and
   burden of a harassed and sorely tried life. "As sorrowful, yet always
   rejoicing."

   Now, these "manifold trials" assume many guises and employ varied
   weapons of painful inquisition. Some of them may be found in the
   antagonism of men. Loyalty to truth may be confronted with persecution.
   A beautiful ministry may be given an evil interpretation. Our
   beneficence may be maligned. Our very leniency may be vituperated and
   proclaimed as a device of the devil. This may be one of the guises of
   "the manifold trials." Or our antagonism may be found in the apparent
   hostility of our circumstances. Success is denied us. Every way we take
   seems to bristle with difficulties. Every street we enter proves to be
   a cul de sac. We never emerge into an airy and spacious prosperity. We
   pass our days in material straits. Such may be another of the guises of
   "the manifold trials." Or it may be that our antagonist dwells in the
   realm of our own flesh. We suffer incessant pain. We are just a bundle
   of exquisite nerves. The streets of the city are instruments of
   torture. The bang of a door shakes the frail house to its base. We are
   the easy victims of physical depression. Who knows but that this may
   have been Paul's "thorn in the flesh"? At any rate, it is one of "the
   manifold trials" by which many of our brethren are put to grief. I will
   go no further with the enumeration, because I am almost impatient to
   once again declare the evangel which proclaims that be hind all these
   apparent antagonisms we may have the unceasing benediction of the joy
   of our Lord. It is possible--I declare it, not as my personal
   attainment, but as a glorious possibility which is both yours and
   mine--it is possible to get so deep into the thought and purpose of
   God, and to dwell so near His very heart, as to "count it all joy" when
   we "fall into manifold trials," because of that mystic spiritual
   alchemy by which trials are changed into blessings and our antagonists
   transformed into our slaves.

   Can we just now nestle a little more closely into the loving purpose of
   God? Why are antagonisms allowed to range themselves across our way?
   Why are there any blind streets which bar our progress? Why does not
   labour always issue in success? Why are "manifold trials" permitted? We
   may find a partial response in the words of my text. They are permitted
   for "the proof" [Verse 7] of our faith. That is the purposed ministry
   of the sharp antagonism and the cloudy day--"the proof of your faith."
   Now, to "prove" the faith means much more than to test it. First of
   all, it means to reveal it. To prove the faith is to prove it to
   others. God wants to reveal and emphasise your faith, and so He sends
   the cloud. May we not say that the loveliness of the moonlight is
   revealed and emphasised by the ministry of the cloud? It is when there
   are a few clouds about, and the moonlight transfiguring them, that the
   glory of the moon herself is declared. And it is when the cloud is in
   the life that the radiance of our faith is proved and proclaimed. How
   conspicuously the calm, steady faith of our glorified Queen was proved
   by the clouds which so frequently gathered about her life! The
   "manifold trials" set out in grand relief that which might have
   remained a commonplace. Light which fringes the cloud is light which is
   beautified. Faith which gleams from behind the trial is faith which is
   glorified. It is the hard circumstance which sets in relief the quality
   of our devotion. As I listened to a thrush singing in the cold dawn of
   a winter's morning, I thought its song seemed sweeter and richer than
   when heard in the advanced days of spring. The wintry setting
   emphasised the quality of the strain. Perhaps if we heard the
   nightingale in the glare of the noontide, the song would not arrest us
   as when it proceeds from the depths of the night. The shades and
   loneliness add something to the sweetness. "And at midnight Paul and
   Silas sang." That is the song which is heard by the fellow-prisoners
   and startles them into wonder. The trial came and your faith was
   "proved." You lost your money, and men discovered your devotion. Your
   gold, the finest of your gold, the most rare and exquisite among your
   treasures, was destroyed and perished; but in the hour of your calamity
   your faith was proved, and men bowed in spiritual wonder before the
   mystery of the Divine. Your trial was your triumph; the place of
   apparent defeat became the hallowed shrine of a glorious conquest. "Now
   are ye in grief through manifold trials," that in the midst of the
   cloud the Lord might "prove" and reveal your faith.

   But "the manifold trials" do more than reveal the faith. There is
   another ministry wrapped up in this suggestive word "prove." The trial
   that reveals the faith also strengthens and confirms it. [Verse 7] The
   faith that is "proved" is more richly endowed. The strong wind and rain
   which try the tree are also the ministers of its invigoration. The
   round of the varying seasons makes the tree "well seasoned," and
   solidifies and enriches its fibre. It is the negative which develops
   the strength of the affirmative. It is antagonism which cultivates the
   wrestler. It is the trial which makes the saint. The man who sustains
   his hold upon God through one trial will find it easier to confront the
   next trial and exploit it for eternal good. And so these "manifold
   trials" prove our faith. They reveal and they enrich our resources.
   They strengthen and refine our spiritual apprehension. They may strip
   us of our material possessions, "the gold that perisheth" but they
   endow us with the wealth of that "inheritance" which is "in corruptible
   and undefiled, and that fadeth not away."

   And, finally, there is one other radiant glimpse of the resplendent
   issues of a "proved" and invigorated faith: "That the proof of your
   faith . . . might be found unto praise and glory and honour at the
   revelation of Jesus Christ." [Verse 7]

   Our "proved" faith is to come to its crown in a manifestation of praise
   and glory and honour. When Jesus appears, these things are to appear
   with Him. The trial of our faith is to issue in "praise." And what
   shall be the praise? On that great day of unveiling, when all things
   are made clear, I shall discover what my trials have accomplished. I
   shall perceive that they were all the time the instruments of a
   gracious ministry, strengthening me even when I thought I was being
   impoverished. The wonderful discovery will urge my soul into song, and
   praise will break upon my lips. "Found unto praise and glory." And
   whose shall be the glory? When the Lord appears, many other things will
   become apparent. What I thought hard will now appear as gracious. What
   I recoiled from as severe I shall find to be merciful. What I esteemed
   as forgetfulness will reveal itself as faith fulness. He was nearest
   when I thought Him farthest away. He was faithful even when I was
   faithless. At His appearing I shall apprehend and appreciate my Lord.
   "The glory of the Lord shall be revealed." "Found unto praise and glory
   and honour." And whence shall flow the honour? I shall find that when
   the Lord sent a trial, and by the trial revealed my faith, many a
   fainting heart took courage, and by the beauty of my devotion many a
   shy soul was secretly wooed into the kingdom of God. I never knew it,
   but at His appearing this shall also appear. This discovery shall be my
   coronation. The supreme honours of heaven are reserved for those who
   have brought others there. "They that turn many to righteousness shall
   shine as the stars for ever and ever." And so by the cloud of manifold
   trials God leads me into the spacious sovereignty of glory, praise, and
   honour.


   God moves in a mysterious way

   His wonders to perform;

   He plants His footsteps in the sea,

   And rides upon the storm.


   Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;

   The clouds ye so much dread

   Are big with mercy, and shall break

   With blessings on your head.

A TWOFOLD RELATIONSHIP AND ITS FRUITS.

   1 Peter i. 8, 9

   Whom not having seen ye love; on whom, though now ye see Him not, yet
   believing, ye rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory.

   "Whom not having seen ye love." [Verse 8] We some times speak of "love
   at first sight." Two lives are brought together, and there is a
   recognition pregnant with far-off destinies. "Deep calleth unto deep."
   The affinities leap into spiritual wedlock. Each knows the other as
   life's complement, and the hearts embrace in hallowed union. It was
   only a look, and love was born:


   Entering then,

   Right o'er a mount of newly fallen stones,

   The dusky-raftered, many-cobwebbed hall,

   He found an ancient dame in dim brocade;

   And near her, like a blossom vermeil-white

   That lightly breaks a faded flower sheath,

   Moved the fair Enid all in faded silk,

   Her daughter. In a moment thought Geraint,

   "Here by God's rood is the one maid for me."

   The fair vision came, and its gentle impression awoke the sleeping love
   and stirred it into fervent and vigilant life. It was "love at first
   sight."

   But love is not always aroused by the first eight. The "first sight"
   may not stir the heart to even a languid interest. The vision may be as
   uninfluential as a cipher. Or the "first sight" may create a repulsion.
   It may excite my dislike. It may rather rouse the critic than wake the
   lover. But love that remains sleeping at the "first sight" may be
   aroused by more intimate communion. The ministries of the spirit may
   triumph where the allurements of the countenance failed. Love may be
   born, not of sight, but of fellowship. It may spring into being amid
   the intimacies of a deepening companionship. You remember the story of
   Othello and Desdemona, and how their hearts were drawn into
   affectionate communion. It Was not love at "first sight," but love at
   heart sight. He told her the story of his chequered life, of "battles,
   sieges, fortunes" he had passed, of disastrous chances, of moving
   accidents by flood and field. "This to hear would Desdemona seriously
   incline."


   My story being done

   She gave me for my pains a world of sighs;

   She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange;

   'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.

   * * * * * *


   She loved me for the dangers I had passed,

   And I loved her that she did pity them.

   It was the communion of spirit with spirit which unsealed the springs
   of their affection. We recognise the principle in common life. A number
   of young people are thrown together in frequent fellowship. For months,
   and perhaps for years, their association does not pass beyond the
   sphere of friendship. But one day the fellowship of two of them opened
   into intimacy, and the sober servant, friendship, made way for the
   master passion, love. They had seen each other's faces for years, and
   they remained companions; they caught a glimpse of each other's hearts,
   and they were trans formed into lovers. So love may be the child of
   spiritual intimacy. It may wait on knowledge. It may wake into being
   through the ministry of a deep communion.

   "Whom not having seen ye love." Theirs was not the love born of gazing
   upon Christ's face, but the love begotten by communion with His heart.
   Love may be born of spiritual fellowship. If only we can get into
   intimacy with the Master's spirit, love may wake into being and song.
   It is just for this opportunity of individual communion that the Master
   is craving. He has little fear of our not falling in love with Him, if
   we will only listen to His story. He wants to visit the heart and
   whisper His evangel in the secret place. Do I debase the sublime quest
   when I say He yearns to "court" the soul, to woo and to win it? "If any
   man will open the door, I will come in and sup with him." That is what
   He asks--an open door. He asks to be allowed to visit the soul, to pay
   His attentions, to declare His aims and purposes, and to whisper the
   Gospel of His own unsearchable love. He wants to talk to us separately
   in individual wooings. He wants us to find a little time to listen to
   Him while He talks about the Father and Sonship, and life and its
   resources, and heaven and its rest and glory. He wants to talk to us
   about the burden of sin and guilt, and the exhaustion of weakness. He
   wants to whisper something to us about our newly born child and about
   our newly made grave. He would like to come very near to us and tell us
   what He knows about sorrow and death, and the morrow which begins at
   the shadow we fear. I say He wants to tell it all to thee and to me--to
   thee, my brother, as though there were no other soul to woo beneath
   God's heaven. The winsome story shall wind its wonderful way around
   Christ and Bethlehem and thee, around Christ and Gethsemane and thee,
   around Christ and Calvary and thee, around Christ and heaven and thee!
   He will tell thee of His agonies and tears, and He will show thee the
   scars He received in the quest of thy redemption.


   Hath He marks to lead me to Him

   If He be my guide?

   In His hands and feet are wound-prints,

   And His side.

   He will tell thee all His story. And the sublime purpose of the
   communion shall be to woo thee, that in His tender fellowship the
   springs of thine own love may be unsealed and thou mayest become
   engaged, by the bonds of an eternal covenant, to the Lord of life and
   glory. "We love him because he first" wooed us The early love may be
   timid and shy, half afraid of itself, and trembling in some un
   certainty, but it shall put on strength and sweetness in the deeper and
   riper fellowships of your wedded life. Wedded to the King, you shall
   come to realise more and more the freedom of His forgiveness, the
   triumph of His power, the sweet pressure of His presence, the alluring
   glory of the living hope, and with this enrichment of your intimacies
   your heart will become possessed by a more intense and fervent
   affection for Him "whom not having seen ye love."

   "On whom . . . believing." [Verse 8] Here is a second expression of the
   Christian's relationship to Christ. "On whom . . . believing." The
   figure is suggestive of a leaning posture, an attitude of dependence, a
   confident resting of one's weight upon the Christ we love. It is the
   acceptance of His reasonings as sound. It is the assumption that His
   judgments are dependable. It is the usage of His weapons as adequate
   for our strife. It is the assurance that His promises are the
   expression of spiritual laws, and that there is no more caprice in
   their ministry than there is in the operation of laws in the physical
   world. "On Him believing." But it is more than assent to a conclusion,
   more than a confidence in His word. It is repose upon a person, a
   resting upon a presence, a trusting in a companionship. If the
   Christian evangel is worth anything at all it means this that the
   Christ of God, the "Lover of the soul," is by the loved one's side in
   inseparable and all-sufficient fellowship. In the moment of
   extraordinary crisis and strain, "on" Him I can depend for immediate
   equipment. In the long-drawn-out day of wearying and monotonous
   commonplace, "on" Him I can lean for unfailing supplies. In the dark
   and cloudy day, and amid the gathering terrors of the advancing night,
   "on" Him I can depend for inspiring light and life. That is the very
   music of the Christian evangel. The words which indicate the Master's
   presence suggest the all-significant closeness of His Spirit.
   "Companion!" "Comforter!" "Fellowship!" "Partaker!" The phraseology
   varies; the significance is one. The Lord is imminent and immediate:
   "Closer is He than breathing, and nearer than hands and feet"; upon Him
   we may trustfully rest our weight in all the changing circumstances of
   our ever-changing way.

   "Whom not having seen ye love; on whom . . . believing, ye rejoice."
   [Verse 8] Is there anything surprising in the issue? Won by His love,
   wedded to the Lord, confident in His fellowship--is it any wonder that
   out of such wealthy conditions there should arise a fountain of joy?
   Surely we have the very ingredients of spiritual delight. If we take
   spiritual affection--"whom not having seen ye love"--and combine it
   with spiritual confidence--"on whom . . . believing"--I do not see how
   we can escape the crown of rejoicing. If either of the elements be
   annihilated, our joy is destroyed. All the bird-music that rings
   through the countryside at the dawn can be hushed by the appearance of
   the hawk. Let your little child come into a presence in whom she has
   not gained confidence, and the light of joy departs, and her face
   becomes like a blown-out lamp. It is the co-operative ministry of love
   and confidence which awakes the genius of joy. It is the love and
   confidence of wedded life which make the clear, calm joy of the
   hurrying years. The thought of the loved one is a baptism of light. A
   letter from the loved one redeems any day from commonplace. The
   presence of the loved one is a full and perpetual feast. It is not
   other wise in the highest relationships. If the soul and the Lord are
   lovers, and there is a mutual confidence, the soul will drink at the
   river of rare and exquisite delights. To think of Him will set the
   bells a-ringing.


   Jesus, the very thought of Thee

   With sweetness fills my breast.

   How unlike that other soul of whom we read in the Sacred Word, "I
   remembered God, and was troubled." A thought that rang an alarm-bell.


   Jesus, the very thought of Thee

   With sweetness fills my breast.

   A remembrance that rang anew the wedding-bells. "Whom not having seen
   ye love." Then it is daytime in the soul. "On whom . . . believing."
   Then there is no cloud over the communion. Daytime and no cloud! Then
   there must be sunshine in the soul. "Ye rejoice greatly with joy
   unspeakable and full of glory."

   "With joy unspeakable." [Verse 8] All the deepest and richest things
   are unspeakable. A mother's love! Who has discovered a symbol by which
   to express it? It is unspeakable. A profound grief! Where is the speech
   in which it can be enshrined?


   In words like weeds I'll wrap me o'er,

   Like coarsest clothes against the cold;

   But that large grief which these enfold

   Is given in outline and no more.

   It is unspeakable. A bleeding sympathy! Has it not just to remain dumb?
   "We stand or sit with interlocked hands, bereft of all adequate
   expression! It is unspeakable. A spiritual joy! How shall we tell it?
   Where is the mould of speech which can catch and hold the ethereal
   presence? It is unspeakable.


   But what to those who find? Ah! this

   Nor tongue nor pen can show:

   The love of Jesus, what it is

   None but His loved ones know.

   "With joy unspeakable and full of glory." [Verse 8] It is a joy which
   is glorious and glorifying. There are joys that weaken and impair the
   soul. The happiness of the world is a corroding atmosphere that blunts
   and destroys the fine perception and discernments of the life. But "joy
   in the Lord" is light which glorifies life. It is like sunshine on the
   landscape. It adds warmth, and beauty, and tenderness, and grace. This
   joy is never productive of weakness; it is synonymous with power. "The
   joy of the Lord is your strength."

   "Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls."
   [Verse 9] Wedded to the Lord in consecrated love, leaning upon Him in
   confident dependence, rejoicing in joy unspeakable--surely this will
   mean a ripening personality maturing day by day, shedding not only its
   disease but also its impotence. We "receive" the salvation of our
   souls. Moment by moment we "receive" it. Our salvation is a gradual but
   assured ascension into the strength and beauty of the King. We are in
   the currents of the everlasting life. Moment by moment we receive the
   end of our faith. Each moment deposits its own contribution to my
   spiritual heritage. Moment by moment I enter more deeply into my
   inheritance in Christ, into "the unsearchable riches of grace."

BEING FASHIONED

  1 Peter i. 13-16

   Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind, be sober and set your hope
   perfectly on the grace that is being brought unto you at the revelation
   of Jesus Christ; as children of obedience, not fashioning yourselves
   according to your former lusts in the time of your ignorance: but like
   as He which called you is holy, be ye yourselves also holy in all
   manner of living; because it is written, Ye shall be holy; for I am
   holy.

   "Wherefore!" [Verse 13] The word gathers up all the wealthy results of
   the previous reasonings. The present appeal is based on the
   introductory evangel. The inspiration of tasks is found in the recesses
   of profound truths. Spiritual impulse is created by the momentum of
   superlative facts. The dynamic of duty is born in the heart of the
   Gospel. "Wherefore," says the apostle, if these be your prospects and
   dynamics, if you have been "begotten again into a living hope," if you
   are heirs to "an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled," if even
   apparent hostilities may be converted into wealthy helpmeets, and
   "manifold trials" into the ministers of salvation, "girding up the
   loins of your mind, be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace
   that is being brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ."

   The "wherefore" is thus suggestive of the bases of this urgent and
   practical appeal. Our life is purposed to shine in Divine dignity. Our
   prospects are glorious. Our resources are abounding. We should
   therefore lay aside our laxity. Life should not be spent in idle
   reverie. Our movement should not be a careless sauntering. Our rest
   should not be a thought less lounging. Life should be characterised by
   clear sight, definite thought, eager purpose, and decided ends.

   "Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind." [Verse 13] The figure of
   the passage is taken from the flowing garments of the Oriental dress.
   The flapping robes catch the wind and wrap themselves about the legs,
   and become serious hindrances to easy and progressive movement. The
   wearer therefore lays hold of the entangling garments and tucks them
   into a girdle, which discharges the ministry of a belt. He gathers
   together the disorderly robes and binds them into a compact and
   serviceable vesture. Now, the apostle declares that a similar disorder
   may prevail in the realm of thought and affection. Our life may be
   characterised by mental slovenliness. Our thoughts may trail in loose
   disorder. We may give little or no care to the beauty and firmness of
   the mind. How much loose thinking there is concerning the profoundest
   and most vital concerns of our life! And the loose thinking does not
   end with itself. A loose garment may trip a man up and cause him to
   stumble. Loose thinking is equally perilous, and may lead to moral
   entanglement and perdition. Loose thinking is creative of loose living;
   mental slovenliness issues in moral disorder. Therefore "gird up the
   loins of your mind." Put some strenuousness into your thinking. Do not
   let your thought drift along on the stream of reverie. Steer your
   thought and strongly guide it into wealthy havens. How do I think about
   God? Loosely and unworthily, or with firm and fruitful conception? "God
   is great," and greatly to be thought about; and if I think about Him
   loosely my sonship will be a stumbling and an offence. How do I think
   about grace? Is my thinking sluggish and unworthy, and so do I "despise
   the riches of his goodness"? How do I think about my spiritual call and
   prospects and destiny? Am I stumbling over my own thinking? Are my own
   garments my most immediate snares? Is my spiritual confusion the result
   of my mental indolence? "My people do not consider." In my want of
   strong and strenuous thinking may be found some explanation of my moral
   and spiritual disasters.

   As it is with the element of thought, so it is with the power of
   affection; for perhaps in the spiritual term "mind" both thought and
   affection are included. We speak of "wandering affections," and truly
   affection may become an appalling vagrant. Affection is easily allured,
   easily entangled, easily snared by the worldly glitter which gleams by
   the side of the common way. Or, if we recur to the apostle's figure,
   our loose affections, like flowing garments that are blown about by the
   wind, entangle our faculties and make havoc of our moral and spiritual
   progress. We must "gird up the loins" of our affection. It will not be
   child's play, but he who wants a religion of child's play must not seek
   the companionship of Christ. The Master spake of cutting off the right
   hand and plucking out the right eye, and the bleeding figure has
   reference to the severing of relationships and the disentangling of
   well-established affections. To free a flowing garment which has been
   caught in a thorn hedge may necessitate rents, and to disentangle an
   unworthy affection may necessitate pain, but even at the cost of rent
   and pain the deliverance must be effected. We must gird up the loins of
   our trailing affections. We must not hold them so cheaply. We must not
   permit them to sweep the broad road and to expose themselves to the
   entanglement of every obtruding thorn. We must "set" our "affections
   upon things above," and for that sublime purpose we must gather them
   together in strenuous concentration. This exhortation is therefore an
   appeal for collectedness both of thought and of feeling. It is a
   warning against mental and affectional looseness, and with loving
   urgency the apostle pleads with his readers to pull themselves
   together, to gird up their loins, and with full energy of thought and
   feeling devote themselves to the worship and service of God.

   "Be sober." [Verse 13] This is more than an injunction against
   intemperance in diet. Intemperance is productive of stupor. It is the
   enemy of a refined sensitiveness. It is creative of heaviness and
   sleep. And it is this closing of the senses, by whatever agency it may
   be induced, against which the apostle raises his voice in clamant
   warning. "Be sober." Be on your guard against everything which is
   creative of heaviness, and which may put your senses into a perilous
   sleep. At all costs keep awake and vigilant! Just as excessive drinking
   drugs the flesh and sinks the body into a heavy sleep, so there are
   other conditions which create a similar stupor in the soul and by which
   the moral and spiritual senses are burdened and benumbed. There are
   opiates and narcotics which may make us spiritually drunk, and render
   us unconscious of the Divine voices that peal from the heights. "Not a
   few sleep." The sleep is induced by opiates. There is the opiate of
   pleasure; there is the opiate of prosperity; there is the opiate of
   self-satisfaction; there is the depressing drug of disappointment.
   Against all these we are to be on our guard. "Be sober," and amid all
   the narcotising atmospheres of enchanted grounds preserve a wakeful
   spirit by a ceaseless fellowship with God.

   "And set your hope perfectly on the grace that is being brought unto
   you in the revelation of Jesus Christ." [Verse 13] Here is the
   spiritual attitude by which the girded and sober life may be attained.
   My resources are to be found in the grace that is brought unto me in
   Christ. In Christ is my reservoir of power. The grace of the Lord Jesus
   is my dynamic. The resource will never fail me. The supply is never
   exhausted. It is "being brought" unto me continually--a "river of water
   of life." Grace is just a full river of heavenly favour, carrying all
   needful equipment and rich with the potencies of eternal life. Upon
   this grace I am to find the basis of my hope. I am to "set my hope
   perfectly" upon this as the all-sufficient energy for lifting me to the
   unveiled heights and enabling me to dwell there in undisturbed
   serenity. I am to release my thought from hindering entanglements, and
   I am to deliver my affection from enslaving fellowships, and I am to
   preserve a vigilant sobriety amid all the sleep-inducing atmospheres of
   the world; and for the accomplishment of this glorious emancipation I
   am bidden to "set my hope perfectly on the grace that is being brought
   unto me at the revelation of Jesus Christ."

   The apostle now probes more deeply into the mode of godly living, and
   unveils a little more clearly the principle by which the holy life is
   fashioned. Life is formed by conformity. There is always a something
   towards which we tend and approximate, and "we take hue from that to
   which we cling." There is always a something "according to" which we
   are being shaped. "According to Thy word," "according to this world,"
   "according to the former lusts." We are for ever coming into accord
   with some thing, and that something determines the fashion of our
   lives. Now, this principle of "forming by conforming" is proclaimed by
   the apostle in the succeeding words of this great passage; and as
   "children of obedience" we are called to a manner of life which at once
   demands a stern nonconformity and a strong and fervent conformity.

   "Not fashioning yourselves according to your former lusts in the time
   of your ignorance." [Verse 14] "Not fashioning . . . according to
   lusts." That conformity must be broken. That "accordance" must be
   destroyed. Our lusts must not be our formatives, giving shape and
   fashion to our lives. If our lust raise its feverish and imperious
   demand, we must be stern and relentless nonconformists. Are we
   imagining that the imperiousness of lust moves in very circumscribed
   ways, and that perhaps we escape from its fierce and burning tyranny?
   The New Testament conception of lust covers a very spacious area, and
   includes elements to which perhaps we should not give the appalling
   name. You may have the same element in different guises, now appearing
   as a solid, and now as a liquid, and now as a gas. And you may have the
   same essential vice in some tangible loathsomeness and in some hidden
   and impalpable temper. The Master told us that we have the same
   essential thing in anger and in murder, only one is gross and solid,
   while the other is gaseous and comparatively refined. But the trouble
   is that, when vice is gaseous, we conceive it as proportionately
   harmless; when it solidifies into open crime, it ensures our
   reprobation. Now, when the Master speaks of lust, He speaks of it in
   its gaseous state, as a condition of thought, as a state of temper, as
   a mode of spirit; and in this interpretation "lust" is just the
   essentially carnal, the itching after the world, the feverish desire
   for selfish pleasure, to the utter ignoring of the supremacy of the
   truth.

   In many lives this lust is the determining and formative force;
   everything is made to bow to it; all the affairs of life are fashioned
   by it. It occupies the throne and moulds all life's concerns into its
   own accord. The apostle vehemently counsels his readers against this
   conformity. He pleads that the children of liberty should not retain
   the governing powers of their servitude. The night should not provide
   the patterns for the day. The season of "ignorance" should not create
   the ruling powers for the season of knowledge and revelation. He urges
   them to revolt against the old forces, to become spiritual
   nonconformists, not fashioning themselves after their former lusts.

   "But like as He which called you is holy, be ye yourselves also holy in
   all manner of living." [Verse 15] The holy God is to be the formative
   force in our life, and to Him are we to be devoted in close and
   intimate conformity. "As He which called you." The call is a Divine
   pledge. The acceptance of the call implies a human obligation. There is
   the pledge on the side of God, and the obligation on the side of man.
   The call, given and received, creates an intimate fellowship. The One
   who calls is holy, and by the mighty ministry of the Spirit he who
   shares the fellowship is transformed into the same holiness. AH
   fellowship with God is productive of spiritual likeness. If we gaze
   into His face, we shall be illumined with the light of His countenance.
   "Beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, we are transformed
   into the same image." We absorb the glory of the Lord. We become
   transfigured by it. Let us mark the breadth of the transforming
   process. We are to be holy "in all manner of living." The pervasive
   power of the Spirit is to influence every walk of life and every part
   of the walk. The transfiguring energy is to inhabit even trifles, and
   the commonplaces of life are to be illumined by the indwelling of the
   eternal light. We shall grow in grace, putting on more and more of the
   beauty of Him in whose fellowship we dwell.

   "Because it is written, Ye shall be holy; for I am holy." [Verse 16]
   That is more than an imperative; it is an evangel. It is a command
   which en shrines a promise. Because God is holy we have the promise of
   holiness. Therefore we may sing with the psalmist, in words which at
   the first hearing may appear strange, "We give thanks at the
   remembrance of His holiness." Wherefore, with this glorious provision
   for our life, with resources more than adequate for our tasks, with
   power that even surpasses the grandeur of our calling, let us "gird up
   the loins of our mind, be sober, and set our hope perfectly on the
   grace that is being brought unto us at the revelation of Jesus Christ."

THE HOLINESS OF THE FATHER

  1 Peter i. 17-21

   And if ye call on Him as Father, who without respect of persons judgeth
   according to each man's work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear:
   knowing that ye were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver
   or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers;
   but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot,
   even the blood of Christ: who was foreknown indeed before the
   foundation of the world, but was manifested at the end of the times for
   your sake, who through Him are believers in God, which raised Him from
   the dead, and gave Him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in
   God.

   "If ye call on Him as Father, who . . . judgeth." [Verse 17] That is an
   extraordinary conjunction of terms. It is a daring and surprising
   companionship to associate, in immediate union, the function of the
   judge with the personality of Father. I had anticipated that the term
   "Father" would have suggested quite other relationships, and would have
   emphasised functions of an altogether different type. I did not
   anticipate the intimate wedlock of "Father" and "judge." I had thought
   that the glad succession would have proceeded somewhat on this wise:
   "If ye call on Him as Father, who loveth!" "If ye call on Him as
   Father, who pitieth!" "If ye call on Him as Father, who forgiveth!" I
   had interpreted the word "father" as being suggestive of the free and
   kindly intimacies of the fireside; but here it stands indicative of the
   august prerogatives of a throne. "If ye call on Him as Father, who
   judgeth." The element which I had forgotten is made conspicuous and
   primary, and determines the shape and colour of man's relationship to
   God.

   "If ye call on Him as Father, who judgeth." Then the element of holy
   sovereignty must be a cardinal content in our conception of the
   Fatherhood of God. What does the term "Father" immediately suggest to
   me? Good nature or holiness; laxity or righteousness; a hearthstone or
   a great white throne? The primary element in my conception will
   determine the quality of my religious life. If the holiness of
   Fatherhood be minimised or obscured, every other attribute will be
   impoverished. Denude your conception of holiness, and it is like
   withdrawing the ozone from the invigorating air, or detracting the
   freshening salt from the healthy sea. Suppress or ignore the element of
   holiness, and think of the Father as affectionate, and the love that
   you attribute to Him will be only as a close and enervating air. Love
   without holiness is deoxygenated, and its ministry is that of an opiate
   or narcotic. Pity without holiness is a bloodless sentiment destitute
   of all healing efficiency. Forgiveness without holiness is the granting
   of a cheap and superficial excuse, in which there is nothing of the
   saving strength of sacrifice. Begin with pity or forgiveness, or
   forbearance or gentleness, and you have dispositions without dynamics,
   poor limp things, which afford no resource for the uplifting and
   salvation of the race. But begin with holiness, and you put a dynamic
   into every disposition which makes it an engine of spiritual health.
   Forgiveness with holiness behind it is a medicated sentiment, fraught
   with healing and bracing ministry. Gentleness with holiness behind it
   touches the aches and sores of the world with the firm and delicate
   hand of a discerning and experienced nurse. Exalt the element of
   holiness, and you enrich your entire conception of the Fatherhood of
   God. The "river of water of life" flows "out of the throne." "The
   Father who judgeth." "Our Father, hallowed be Thy name."

   And now the apostle proceeds to tell us how his conception of the
   holiness of God is fostered and enriched. Wherever he turns it is God's
   holiness, and not God's pity, which smites and arrests his attention.
   He is never permitted to become irreverent, for lie is never out of
   sight of "the great white throne." He moves in fruitful wonder, ever
   contemplating the glory of the burning holiness of God. If he meditates
   upon the character of the Father's judgments, it is their holiness by
   which he is possessed. If he moves with breathless steps amid the
   mysteries of redemption, even beneath the blackness of the cross he
   discovers the whiteness of the throne. If he dwells upon the purposes
   of the Divine yearning, it is the holiness of the Father's ambition for
   His children which holds him entranced. The holiness of the Father
   emerges everywhere. It is expressed and placarded in all His doings.
   Everywhere could the apostle take upon his lips the words of another
   wondering spirit who gazed and worshipped in a far-off day: "I saw the
   Lord, high and lifted up! Holy, holy, holy is the LORD."

   "The Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to each
   man's work." [Verse 17] The apostle finds the holiness of the Father
   expressed in the character of His judgments. The elements which so
   commonly shape the judgments of men do not count in the judgments of
   God. He judgeth "without respect of persons." Fine feathers do not
   count as refinement. Faces may be masks. The "persona" may be an actor.
   The Father pays no respect to the mere show of things. All masks become
   transparent. All veils become trans lucent. The material show, with all
   ephemeral titles, and nobilities, and dignities, and degrees, are not
   accepted as evidence, but are put down, and only spiritual
   characteristics and moral essentials are permitted as testimony of
   personal worth. "The Father, without respect of persons, judgeth
   according to each man's work." [Verse 17] And what is the bulk and
   quality of my work? If the Father judge me by my output in the shape of
   finished and realised achievement, then I shrink from the wretched
   unveiling! I have laboured for the salvation of men; how will He judge
   my "work"? Will He tabulate the results? Will He count my converts? Is
   that how James Gilmour will be judged, who after long years of labour
   in Mongolia could not record a single regenerated soul? If "work" means
   finished results, how few of us will be crowned! "This is the work,
   that ye believe." That is the basis of judgment. How much of holy
   energy is expressed in our relationship to God? What is the strength of
   our fellowship with the Divine? That is the primal energy of character,
   and that is the criterion of the Divine judgment. Out of that energy of
   belief there is born the magnificent force which expresses itself in
   prolonged labours in Mongolia, in fearless pioneering in New Guinea, in
   unromantic, educational ministry in India, in plucky, unyielding
   struggle with great evils in England, in tiring, unapplauded toil among
   the poor, in dry and heart-breaking service among the rich, in steady,
   persistent battle with "the world, the flesh, and the devil." All these
   toils are the offspring of belief. In the energy of belief they find
   their life and the secret of their dauntless perseverance. And so James
   Gilmour will not be judged by his "results," but by his "bloody sweat."
   He will be judged, and so shall we all, by the supplicating wrestle of
   the heart, by the quality of our aspiration, by the depth and fervour
   of our belief. In this type and character of judgment the apostle sees
   the mark of the holiness of God. "I saw the dead, small and great,
   stand before God," and the Father judged them "according to each man's
   work." "I remember thy work of faith."

   The apostle now turns to another expression of the holiness of the
   Father, and he finds it in the character of our redemption. "Knowing
   that," reflecting that, "ye were redeemed, not with corruptible things
   . . . but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without
   spot, even the blood of Christ." [Verses 18, 19] Now, link to this a
   previous word which forms a vital part of the apostle's reasoning. "I
   am holy." He immediately unites the conception of holiness with the
   ministry of redemption. To keep that holiness in mind I am to reflect
   upon the character of redemption. I am to gaze into the mysterious
   depths of redemption, and I shall behold the holiness of my Father.
   Now, that is not our common inclination. We look into redemption for
   mercy, forgiveness, condescension, love. We look for the genial flame
   of affection; have we been blind to the dazzling blaze of holiness? We
   have felt the warm, yearning intimacy of love, inclining towards the
   sinner; have we felt the fierce, burning heat where holiness touches
   sin?

   Redemption is more than the search of Father for child; it is a
   tremendous wrestle of holiness with sin. Have we felt only the
   tenderness of the search, and partially over looked the terribleness of
   the conflict? The fear is that we may feel the geniality of the one
   without experiencing the consuming heat of the other. I proclaim it as
   a modern peril. We do not open our eyes to the holiness that battles in
   our redemption, and so we gain only an enervated conception of
   redemptive love. Is not this a characteristic of many of the popular
   hymns which gather round about the facts of redemption? They are sweet,
   sentimental, almost gushing; the light, lilting songs of a thoughtless
   courtship: deep in their depths I discern no sense of bloody conflict,
   nor do I taste any tang of the bitter cup which made our Saviour
   shrink. And so, because we do not discern the majestic crusade of
   holiness, we do not realise the enormity of sin. If we look into the
   mystery of redemption, and do not see the august holiness of God, we
   can never see the blackness of the sovereignty of sin. Dim your sense
   of holiness, and you lighten the colour of sin. Now see what follows.
   Obscure the holiness and you relieve the blackness of sin. Relieve the
   blackness of sin and you impoverish the glory of redemption. The more
   we lighten sin the more we uncrown our Redeemer. If sin be a light
   thing, the Redeemer was superfluous. And so, with holiness hidden and
   sin relieved, we come to hold a cheap redemption, and it is against the
   conception of a cheap redemption that the apostle raises an eager and
   urgent warning--"There was nothing cheap about your redemption. It was
   not a light ministry which cost a mere trifle. Ye were redeemed, not
   with corruptible things, as silver and gold, but with precious blood,
   even the blood of Christ." Reason from the cost of redemption to the
   nature of the conflict; reason from the nature of the conflict to the
   black enormity of sin; reason from the enormity of sin to the glory of
   holiness! A lax God could have given us licence and so redeemed us
   cheaply! A cheap redemption might have made us feel easy; it would
   never have made us good. A cheap forgiveness would only have confirmed
   the sin it forgave. If we are to see sin we must behold holiness,
   unveiled for us as in a "lamb without blemish and without spot." [Verse
   19 ] And so in the sacrifice of Christ, the apostle discerns something
   of the holiness of the Father, and thus apprehends the unspeakable
   antagonism of holiness and sin. To him redemption is more than a
   search; it is a conflict. It is more than a tender yearning; it is the
   mighty bearing of an appalling load. Between the Incarnation, when
   Christ was manifested, and the Resurrection, when God raised Him from
   the dead, the powers of holiness and sin met face to face in mighty
   combat, and in the appalling darkness of Gethsemane and Calvary sin was
   overthrown and holiness was glorified. When I move amid the mysteries
   of redemption, I never want to become deaf to my Saviour's words, "If
   it be possible, let this cup pass from Me." I never want His cry to go
   out of my life, "My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?" So long as
   that cry sounds through the rooms of my life I can never have a cheap
   Redeemer, and I shall be kept from the enervating influence of a cheap
   redemption. In redemption I behold an unspeakable conflict which keeps
   me ever in mind of the holiness of the Father hood of God. In my
   conception of redemption there shall be "no curse," nothing withering
   and destructive, for "the throne of God and the Lamb shall be in it."
   In the sacrifice of love I shall behold the holiness of God.

   Out of this large conception of a holy Father hood there will arise a
   worthy conception of sonship. If God be holy, expressing His holiness
   in all His dealings, and "if ye call on Him as Father," what manner of
   children ought ye to be? If I call the holy God "my Father," the
   assumption of kinship implies obligation to holiness. If I say
   "Father," I may not ignore holiness. "If God were your father," ye
   would bear His likeness. "Ye shall be holy; for I am holy." If then ye
   call on Him as "Father," put yourselves in the way of appropriating His
   glory, and of becoming radiant with the beauty of His holiness: "pass
   the time of your sojourning in fear." [Verse 17] There is no suggestion
   in the counsel of any enslaving timidity. We are not to cringe like
   slaves, or to move as though we expected that at any moment an abyss
   might open at our feet. The Christian's walk is a fine swinging step,
   born of hope and happy confidence. To "pass the time in fear "is not to
   move in paralysing dread. Nor is it to be the victim of a paralysing
   particularity which converts every trifle into a thorn, and makes the
   way of life a via dolorosa of countless irritations. The Christian is
   neither a faddist nor a slave. To "pass the time in fear "is just to be
   fearful of sleep, to watch against indifference, to be alert against an
   insidious thoughtlessness, to be spiritually awake and to miss no
   chance of heightening the purity of our souls by all the ministries of
   holy fellowships, and by a ready obedience to the Master's will. "If ye
   call on Him as Father," let the majestic claim inspire you to a
   spacious ambition: "pass your time "in a fervent aspiration after His
   likeness, "perfecting holiness in the fear of the Lord."

THE CREATION OF CULTURE AND AFFECTION

  1 Peter i. 22-25

   Seeing ye have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth unto
   unfeigned love of the brethren, love one another from a clean heart
   fervently: having been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but of
   incorruptible, through the word of God, which liveth and abideth. For,
   All flesh is as grass, and all the glory thereof as the flower of
   grass. The grass withereth, and the flower falleth: but the word of
   the, Lord abideth for ever.

   IN the very heart of this passage there lies a fair and exquisite
   flower--the flower of an in tense and fervent affection. Its
   surroundings reveal to us the means of its production. The earlier
   clauses of the passage describe the mode of its growth; the later
   clauses describe the cause of its growth. The first part is descriptive
   of the rootage and the preliminary life of the flower of love; the
   second part proclaims the all-enswathing atmosphere in which growth is
   rendered possible and sure. On the one hand, there are revealed to us
   the successive and progressive stages of spiritual culture; on the
   other hand, we are introduced to the all-pervading power which
   determines their evolution. The earlier part centres round about
   "obedience"; the latter part gathers round about "the word of God." The
   first half emphasises the human; the second half emphasises the Divine.
   The human and the Divine combine and co-operate, and in their mingled
   ministry create the sweet and unpolluted flower of love.

   "Love one another from a clean heart fervently." [Verse 22] How can I
   grow this sweet, white flower of love? Its creation is not the
   immediate result of volition; it is the issue of a process. We cannot
   command it; we can grow it. It is not an "alpha "but an "omega," the
   "amen" in a spiritual succession. If I want the flower, I must begin at
   the root. If I want the love, I must begin with obedience. The first
   stage towards a fervent affection is "obedience to the truth" If a soul
   yearns to be crowned and beautified by the grace of a delicate love, it
   must put itself in the posture of "obedience to the truth." Ay, but
   what is this truth to which we are to pay obeisance? Just as I penned
   the question, the sun, which had been concealed behind a cloud, broke
   from its hiding, and a broad, wealthy tide of light flowed over the
   garden, and revealed the young leaves in resplendent glory. The word
   "tree" obtains a new significance when you see the branches swaying in
   the golden light. It is even so with the familiar word "truth." To one
   man the word is suggestive of a dim, dull, cloudy quantity, having
   little or nothing of arresting radiance or beauty. To another man
   "truth "is a gloriously unclouded light, suggesting the hallowed beauty
   of the eternal God. What do we mean by the term "hill"? That depends
   upon where we have lived. The word "hill" has one significance at
   Snowdon, another at Ben Nevis, another at Mont Blanc, and another amid
   the gigantic heights of Northern India. What do we mean by "the truth"?
   Where have we lived? The apostle has not used the word "truth" before.
   He seems to have kept it in abeyance until by some preliminary thought
   he has prepared our minds to give it adequate content. He has been
   leading us through a pilgrimage of contemplation, and at the end of the
   journey he utters the word "truth," and if we would enter into his
   conception we must pack the word with the experiences of the previous
   way. We have been peering into the Fatherhood of God. The apostle has
   been pointing out to us elements which we were inclined to forget. We
   looked into the Father hood for sweetness; He pointed out whiteness. We
   looked for gentleness; He pointed out holiness. We looked for tender
   yearnings towards the sinner; He would not permit us to overlook the
   Divine hostility to sin. Wherever the apostle turns in the
   contemplation of the Father hood, it is the "whiteness" that arrests
   him. He looks into the Father's judgments, and he beholds the whiteness
   of holiness. He glances behind the veil into the mysteries of
   redemption, and even amid the sacrifices of love he beholds the glory
   of "the great white throne." Wherever he turns his wondering gaze, it
   is the perception of a character "without blemish and without spot"
   that brings him to his knees. When, therefore, we emerge from the
   solemn sight-seeing, as we do in the twenty-second verse, and I hear
   the apostle use the word "truth," I know that he inserts into the word
   the content of superlative whiteness, and that while he uses it he bows
   before the holiness of the Fatherhood of God. Here, then, we must begin
   the culture of affection. We must begin with the contemplation of
   whiteness, with a steady, steadfast gazing upon the holiness of the
   Fatherhood of God. We must let holiness tower in our conception of God,
   as the dazzling snow abides on the lifted heights of the Alps. The
   "truth" is the unveiled face of the Holy Father. The first step in the
   creation of pure affection is the contemplation of a Holy God.

   The apostle uses a very graphic word to further describe the healthy
   pose of a soul in reference to "the truth." We are to be in "obedience
   to the truth." There is a stoop in the word. It is a kneeling at
   attention. It is an eager inclining of the ear to catch the whisper of
   the Holy God. But it is more than that. It is the attention of a soul
   that is girt and ready for service. The wings are plumed for
   ministering flight. It is a listening, for the purpose of a doing.
   "Whosoever heareth these sayings of Mine and doeth them." It is a soul
   waiting consciously and eagerly upon the Holy Father with the intent of
   hearing and doing His will. This is "obedience to the truth," and this
   is the preliminary step in the creation and culture of God.

   Now, let us pass to the vital succession described in the text. We
   enter a second stage of this progressive gradation. "Ye have purified
   your souls in your obedience to the truth." [Verse 22] While ye were
   doing the one, ye were accomplishing the other. Obedience to truth is
   the agent of spiritual perfection. Homage to holiness is the minister
   of refinement. To bow to the august is to enlarge the life. "He that
   humbleth himself shall be exalted." To listen in waiting attention for
   the expression of the will of holiness is to fill the life with
   cleansing and refining ministry. We bleach our fabrics by exposing them
   to the light. We whiten our spiritual garments by dwelling in the
   hallowed glory of the Light of Life. We "purify our souls" by our
   "obedience to the truth." We purify them. We make them chaste in all
   the varied meaning of that wealthy word. We rid them of secret
   defilements, washing quite out of the grain the soaking filth of
   selfishness and of impure ambition. We free them of all the
   uncouthness, the rudeness, and the rough discourtesies of the
   unhallowed life. We deliver them from the meretricious, the tawdry
   graces that are made to do duty for the fair realities of the
   sanctified life. The soul is made grandly simple, endowed with the
   winsome naturalness and grace of an unaffected child. This is the way
   of the eternal. When we dwell in the light, the powers of the soul are
   being rarefied, touched, and moulded into ever finer discernments. The
   organic quality of the life is enriched, and possibilities awakened of
   which we hardly dreamed. We transform our spiritual sub stance when we
   change our spiritual posture. We "purify our souls by our obedience to
   the truth."

   Now, mark the next stage in this brightening sequence. "Ye have
   purified your souls . . . unto unfeigned love." [Verse 22] We are
   rising into finer issues. We have passed from hallowed obedience to
   purified spirit, and now we go on to unfeigned affection! The rarest
   issue of the rose-tree is the perfume of the rose. From root to perfume
   you ascend a gradation of increasing refinements until you come to its
   subtle and bewitching breath. And here in my text we have arrived at
   the sphere of fragrance, the realm of sentiment, the haunt of
   affection. "Ye have purified your souls . . . unto unfeigned love."
   Mark the directive force of the preposition--"purified unto love"; as
   though the purification of the soul made straight, as by a gracious
   destiny, for the birth and revelation of love. The spirit can be so
   chastened, so refined by "obedience to the truth," that love will
   emerge from it as naturally and spontaneously as perfume distils from a
   rose. "He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that
   loveth!" He cannot help loving; his love is a spontaneous affluence,
   and he can no more restrain it than the rose can imprison her fragrance
   when she is tossed by the playful breeze. A fine sentiment is the
   offspring of a fine spirit. The posture of the soul determines the
   quality of the disposition. If the soul; "live and move and have her
   being" in the presence of the Holy Father, revealed in Christ our
   Saviour, and shape her course in "obedience to the truth," she will be
   sublimed, and all her ministries will be attended by a gracious
   affection, diffusing itself as fragrance about the common ways of men.
   "Ye have purified your soul unto unfeigned love of the brethren."

   But now it may occasion a little surprise that, having reached this
   apparent climax in the thought, the affluence of a spontaneous
   affection, the apostle should add the injunction, "love one another
   from a clean heart fervently!" [Verse 22] What is the purpose of the
   apparently needless addition? We have watched the ascending stages in
   the spiritual processes that issue in love; what if there are ascending
   stages in the refinement of love itself? There may be degrees of riches
   even in perfumes. Even love itself may be refined into more and more
   exquisite .quality. That, I think, is the meaning of the apostle's
   counsel. He urges them to seek for the superlative in the sweet kingdom
   of love, ever to set their minds on "the things above," and to fix
   their yearnings upon still finer issues. We get a clear glimpse into
   the apostle's mind through the vivid word in which he urges the
   counsel, "love one another . . . fervently." There is a suggestion of
   increased tension in the word, as when the string of a violin has been
   stretched to a tighter pitch that it might yield a higher note. That is
   the apostle's figure--a little more tension, that you may reach a
   little higher note. There are heights of love unreached. Tighten the
   strings of your devotion, that your soul may yield the entrancing
   strains. Be vigilant against all laxity, and stretch yourselves to the
   uttermost in the endeavour to compass the manifold music of the
   marvellous scales of love. When, there fore, the apostle enjoins a more
   fervent love, I feel that he drives me back to the first preliminary
   stage of spiritual growth. When he appeals for higher notes of love, he
   is really counselling a deeper holiness. If my love is to be more
   intense, I must seek a "closer walk with God." I must tighten my
   holiness if I would enrich my music. There will come a more discerning
   love when there is a more devoted obedience. I shall pass from finer
   homage to rarer spiritual purity, and from rarer spiritual purity to
   increasing exquisiteness in love. "Seeing you have purified your souls
   in your obedience to the truth unto unfeigned love of the brethren,
   love one another from a clean heart fervently."

   How can we depend upon this succession in the processes? How can we be
   assured that one stage will lead to another in inevitable spiritual
   gradation? What is the nature of the bond and the quality of the
   guarantee? What is our assurance that "obedience to truth" will issue
   in chaste refinement of spirit, and that spiritual refinement will be
   crowned by a rare and fervent affection? The basis of our reliance is
   "the word of God." [Verse 23] It was through the word of God there was
   given to us the seed of a regenerated life. We were "begotten again,
   not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of
   God." That word, through which there came the first, faint seminal
   beginnings of a holy life, remaineth sure through all the stages of
   subsequent growth. We may rely upon "the word of God." It "liveth and
   abideth," an energising all-enveloping atmosphere, in which the
   beautiful young growth will be matured. If the centre of love depended
   upon the power of any human ministry, the issue would assuredly fail.
   Our dependence would then be built upon a thing enduring only through a
   transient season. Human aid is but "as the grass"; and the best of
   human aid, the very glory of it, only as "the flower of grass" [Verse
   24 ] In the fierce, scorching noontide, the time of feverish strain,
   when we are most in need of enriching rest, "the grass withereth, and
   the flower falleth," and there is barrenness where we yearned to find a
   soft and healing peace. No; not upon flesh must we depend for the
   evolution of the spiritual life. "Our hope is in God." The Lord Himself
   pervades the processes and determines the line of ascending growth.
   "The word of the Lord abideth for ever." [Verse 25]

THE LIVING STONES AND THE SPIRITUAL HOUSE

   1 Peter ii. 1-10

   Putting away therefore all wickedness, and all guile, and hypocrisies,
   and envies, and all evil speakings, as newborn babes, long for the
   spiritual milk which is without guile, that ye may grow thereby unto
   salvation; if ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious: unto whom
   coming, a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but with God elect,
   precious, ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, to
   be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to
   God through Jesus Christ. Because it is contained in scripture, Behold,
   I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that
   believeth on Him shall not be put to shame. For you therefore which
   believe is the preciousness: but for such as disbelieve, The stone
   which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner;
   and, A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence; for they stumble at
   the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed. But ye
   are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for
   God's own possession, that ye may shew forth the excellencies of Him
   who called you out of darkness into His marvellous light: which in time
   past were no people, but now are the people of God: which had not
   obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.

   THERE is a wonderful ascending gradation in the earlier portions of
   this great chapter. It begins in the darkness, amid "wickedness" and
   "guile" and "hypocrisies," and it winds its way through the wealthy,
   refining processes of grace, until it issues in the "marvellous light"
   of perfected redemption. It begins with individuals, who are possessed
   by uncleanness, holding aloof from one another in the bondage of "guile
   "and "envies "and "evil speakings"; it ends in the creation of glorious
   families, sanctified communities, elect races, "showing forth the
   excellencies" of the redeeming Lord. We pass from the corrupt and
   isolated individual to a redeemed and perfected fellowship. We begin
   with an indiscriminate heap of unclean and undressed stones; we find
   their consummation in a "spiritual house," standing consistent and
   majestic in the light of the glory of God. We begin with scattered
   units; we end with co-operative communions. The subject of the passage
   is therefore clearly defined. It is concerned with the making of true
   society, the creation of spiritual fellowship, the realisation of the
   family, the welding of antagonistic units into a pure and lovely
   communion.

   Where must we begin in the creation of this communion? The building of
   the house, says the apostle, must begin in the preparation of the
   stones. If the family is to be glorified, the individual must be
   purified. A choir is no richer than its individual voices, and if we
   wish to enrich the harmony we must refine the constituent notes. The
   basis of all social reformation is individual redemption. And so I am
   not surprised that the apostle, who is contemplating the creation of
   beautified brotherhoods, should primarily concern himself with the
   preparation of the individual. But how are the stones to be cleaned and
   shaped and dressed for the house? How is the individual to be prepared?
   By what spiritual processes is he to be fitted for larger fellowships
   and family communion? I think the apostle gives us a threefold answer.

   "If ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious." [Verse 3] That is the
   basal clause of the entire chapter. Everything begins here. It is no
   use our dreaming of perfected human relationships until the individual
   has deliberately tasted the things that are Divine. A chastened palate
   in the individual is a primary element in the consolidation of the
   race. There must be a personal experimenting with God. There must be a
   willingness to try the spiritual hygiene enjoined in the Gospel of
   Christ. We must "taste and see" what the grace is like that is so
   freely offered to us of God. We must taste it, and find out for
   ourselves its healthy and refreshing flavour. What is implied in the
   apostle's figure? In the merely physical realm, when we taste a thing,
   what are the implications of the act? When we take a thing up
   critically for the purpose of discerning its flavour, there are at any
   rate two elements contained in the method of our approach. There is an
   application of a sense, and there is the exercise of the judgment. We
   bring an alertness of palate that we may register sensitive
   perceptions, and we bring an alertness of mind that we may exercise a
   discriminating judgment. Well, these two elements are only symbolic of
   the equipment that is required if we would "taste and see how gracious
   the Lord is." We need to present to the Lord a sensitive sense and a
   vigilant mind. There is no word which is read so drowsily as the Word
   of God. There is no business so sluggishly executed as the business of
   prayer. If men would discern the secret flavours of the Gospel, they
   must come to it wide awake, and sensitively search for the conditions
   by which its hidden wealth may be disclosed. "Son of man, eat that thou
   findest. . . . Then did I eat it, and it was in my mouth as honey for
   sweetness." He had tasted and seen. "Eat that thou findest!" Well, the
   only way in which we can eat a message is to obey it. Obedience is
   spiritual consumption; and in the act of obedience, in the act of
   consumption, we discern the wondrous flavours of grace. We are, there
   fore, to approach the Gospel of our Lord. We are to patiently and
   sensitively realise its conditions. We are to put ourselves in the
   attitude of obedience, and, retaining a bright and wakeful mind, we
   shall begin to discern the glories of our redemption. We shall taste
   the flavour of reconciliation, the fine grace of forgiveness, and the
   exquisite quality of peace. This is the primary step in the creation of
   the family; the individual is to taste and appreciate the things of
   God.

   All delights imply repulsions. All likes necessitate dislikes. A strong
   taste for God implies a strong distaste for the ungodly. The more
   refined my taste, the more exacting becomes my standard. The more I
   appreciate God, the more shall I depreciate the godless. I do not
   wonder, therefore, that in the chapter before us the "tasting" of grace
   is accompanied by a "putting away" [ Verse 1] of sin. If I welcome the
   one, I shall "therefore" repel the other. The finer my taste, the more
   scrupulous will be my repulsions. Mark the ascending refinement in this
   black catalogue of expulsions: "wickedness, guile, hypocrisies, envies,
   evil speakings!" The list ranges from thick, soddened, compact
   wickedness up to un kindly speech, and I am so to grow in my Divine
   appreciation that I just as strongly repel the gilded forms of sin as I
   do those that savour of the exposed and noisome sewer. The taste of
   grace implies the "putting away" of sin; and therefore the second step
   in the creation of the family is the cleansing of the individual. Is
   the cleansing essential? Let us lay this down as a primary axiom in the
   science of life--there can be no vital communion between the unclean.
   Why, we cannot do a bit of successful soldering unless the surfaces we
   wish to solder are vigorously scraped of all their filth. I suppose
   that, in the domain of surgery, one of the greatest discoveries of the
   last fifty years has been the discovery of dirt, and the influence
   which it has exercised as the minister of severance and alienation. It
   has been found to be the secret cause of inflammation, the hidden agent
   in retarded healing, the subtle worker in embittered wounds; and now
   surgical science insists that all its operations be performed in the
   most scrupulous cleanliness, and its intensified vigilance has been
   rewarded by pure and speedy healings and communions. It is not
   otherwise in the larger science of life. Every bit of uncleanness in
   the individual is a barrier to family communion. All dirt is the
   servant of alienation. It is essential, if we would have strong and
   intimate fellowships, that every member be sweet and clean. "Therefore
   put away all wickedness, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies and
   all evil speakings," and by purified surfaces let us prepare ourselves
   for spiritual communion.

   "As newborn babes, long for the spiritual milk." [Verse 2] Having
   tasted of the grace of the Lord, and freeing yourselves from the
   embittering presence of sin, adopt an exacting diet--"long for the
   spiritual milk which is without guile." Feed upon the loftiest ideals.
   Suffer nothing of adulterating compromise to enter into your spiritual
   food. Nourish yourselves upon aspirations undefiled. Do not let your
   wine be mingled with water. Do not permit any dilution from the
   suggestions of the world. "Long for the spiritual milk which is without
   guile, that ye may grow thereby unto salvation." [Verse 2] It is the
   unadulterated food that ministers to growth. It is the high ideal which
   lifts men to the heights. The loftiness of one's aim determines the
   degree of one's growth. In these matters my spiritual gravitation is
   governed by my personal aspirations, my spirit pursues the path and
   gradient of my desires.

   Here, then, is the threefold preparation of the individual for a family
   life of intimate and fruitful fellowship--a personal experience of
   grace, the expulsion from the life of all uncleanness, and the adoption
   of a rigorous and uncompromising ideal. The whole preparatory process
   is begun, continued, and ended in Christ. In Christ the individual is
   lodged, and in His grace, which is all-sufficient, he finds an abundant
   equipment for the spacious purpose of his perfected redemption.

   Now, let us assume that the individual is ready for the fellowship. We
   have got the unit of the family. We have got the "living stone."
   cleansed, shaped, dressed, ready to be built into the "spiritual
   house." How, now, shall the society be formed? What shall be its
   cement? What shall be its binding medium, and the secret of its
   consistency? Here are the "living stones"; what shall we do with them?
   "Unto whom coming . . . as living stones ye are built up a spiritual
   house." [ Verses 4, 5] "Unto whom coming!" The living stones are to
   find their bond of union in the living Christ. The alpha of all
   enduring communion is Christ. We cannot prepare the individual stones
   without Christ. We cannot build the individual stones into a house
   without Christ. He is the "corner stone," and the pervading strength of
   every enduring structure. What is the implication of all this? It is
   this. We cannot have society without piety. We may have juxtapositions,
   connections, clubs, fleeting and superficial relationships, but the
   only enduring brotherhood is the brotherhood which is built upon faith.
   Apart from the Christ there can be no social cohesion. The "Word of God
   proclaims it, and history confirms it. Every preposition seems to have
   been exhausted by the Word of God in emphasising the necessity of a
   fundamental relationship with Christ--"in Christ," "through Christ,"
   "by Christ," "with Christ," "unto Christ." In every conceivable way
   Christ is proclaimed as the all-essential. In seeking to create
   societies we have therefore got to reckon with the Christ. We cannot
   ignore Him. He will not be ignored. We either use Him or we fall over
   Him. We use Him and rise into strength, or we neglect Him and stumble
   into ruin. We either make Him the "head of the corner," [Verses 7, 8]
   or He becomes our "stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence."
   Societies and families and nations, which are not built upon the
   Christ, fall to pieces, thrown into ruin by the very "law of the spirit
   of life." But have not societies been built upon the Christ, and yet
   been far from manifesting the glory of a radiant, family communion?
   Look at the sects! Is not Christ the corner stone, and yet where is the
   sweet communion? Ah! it is when the different communities have got away
   from the Christ that their communion has been destroyed. It is when the
   sects get away from the spirit of the Christ, when they become
   wranglers about a letter, when they are heated by the fever of personal
   vanity, and lust for the spoils of sectarian triumph--it is then that
   the spiritual house collapses, and lies scattered in a heap of
   inhospitable fragments. But when we build upon Him, when He, and He
   only, is "the preciousness," when all our personal aims are merged in
   line with His, when we have the Spirit of Christ, then are we bound
   into a gracious communion, into a vital and fundamental unity. And into
   what is He prepared to build us? This chapter is overflowing in the
   wealth of the figures by which it seeks to express the glorious
   mission. He will build us into a "spiritual house," [ Verse 5] a
   spacious home, enclosing but one tenant, the gracious Spirit of God. He
   will distinguish us as "an elect race," [Verse 9] moving in the world,
   yet not of it, standing out in strong relief from the discordant and
   fragmentary life by which it is surrounded. He will endow us with all
   the dignities of "a royal priesthood," having kingly and priestly
   prerogatives, reigning with Christ in the realm of the spirit and
   exercising a powerful ministry of intercession in the most holy
   presence of God. He will constitute us "a holy nation," a people whose
   policies shall be purities, and whose state craft shall just be the
   enlightened administration of large and unselfish minds. This is what
   our God is prepared to make of us. It is a great ideal, but then we
   have a great Father and a great Saviour and a mighty Spirit, and vast
   ideals are native to the very spirit of our redemption. It is a grand
   house which the Lord would build, and if only He had the stones the
   majestic edifice would speedily be reared.

   And what is to be the mission of the glorified fellowship? If even two
   or three are gathered together, by common possession of the Spirit of
   Christ, into a sanctified society, what purpose is to be achieved by
   their communion? They are to "shew forth the excellencies of Him who
   called them out of darkness into His marvellous light." [Verse 9] The
   "elect race" will be distinguished by its cheeriness, its geniality,
   its radiant sympathies, its abounding optimism. It will be of little
   use our professing that we are "called into marvellous light "if our
   society is only the home of controversy, or the abode of a brooding
   melancholy and depression. The redeemed society is composed of
   "children of light." We are to prove that "now we are the people of
   God," [Verse 10] that we have been naturalised--or shall I say
   supernaturalised?--into the kingdom of God, and we are to prove it by
   bringing into common affairs the air of a better country, a loftier
   tone, a finer temper, a nobler spirit. "Our citizenship" is to be "in
   heaven," and we are to "shew forth the excellencies of God" in the
   lightsomeness and spirituality of His people. Such is to be the
   ministry of the spiritual society which our Father will create out of
   His reconciled and sanctified children. Such is to be the "spiritual
   house," built up of "living stones," and having as its one and only
   foundation Jesus Christ, our Lord.

THE MINISTRY OF SEEMLY BEHAVIOUR

  1 Peter ii. 11-17

   Beloved, I beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from
   fleshly lusts which war against the soul; having your behaviour seemly
   among the Gentiles; that, wherein they speak against you as evil-doers,
   they may by your good works, which they behold, glorify God in the day
   of visitation. Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lord's
   sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; or unto governors, as sent
   by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to them that do well.
   For so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye should put to silence
   the ignorance of foolish men: as free, and not using your freedom for a
   cloke of wickedness, but as bondservants of God. Honour all men. Love
   the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.

   THIS is an appeal for the evangelising influences of a chaste and
   winsome character. It is an apostolic entreaty to consider the
   immeasurable momentum of a beautiful life. It is a glorification of the
   silent witness of saintliness. It is not given to all men to have the
   faculty and function of the prophet, his clear sight, and his power of
   fruitful interpretation, The persuasive, wooing speech, of the
   evangelist is not an element in the common endowment. The evangelist
   and the prophet may be only infrequent creations, and their gifts may
   have only a limited distribution. But we may all exercise the ministry
   of beauty. Every man may be an ambassador of life, discharging his
   office through the medium of holiness. Every man may be an evangelist
   in the domain of character, distributing his influence through the
   odour of sanctity, in seemliness of behaviour, in exquisite fitness of
   speech, in finely finished and well-proportioned life. This is a
   ministry for every body, the apostleship of spiritual beauty. And so in
   the passage before us the apostle is engaged in delineating the
   features of the character that tells. He is depicting a forceful life.
   He is exhibiting the behaviour which is influential in leading men to
   reverent thought and religious inquiry and spiritual conviction. What
   are these public aspects of the sanctified life? By what kind of living
   can we best arouse the interest of the world in the claims and kingdom
   of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ? How may we become powerful
   evangelists, even though we have been denied the gift of tongues? How
   may we arrest the world in fruitful wonder? Let us seek the answer in
   the apostolic word.

   "Abstain from fleshly lusts." [ Verse 11] That is the first note in the
   forceful life. Do not let us so narrow its interpretation that the
   majority of us escape the grip of the apostle's injunction. Let us
   attribute a comprehensive content to the unwelcome word "lust." Lust
   includes the entire army of unclean forces which are antagonistic to
   the exalted realm of the spirit. It includes not only the carnal
   desire, but the jealous eye and the itching palm. It comprehends every
   form of heated and feverish motion which is destructive of spiritual
   treasure. Fleshly lust is anything in the life which steams the windows
   of the spirit. Fleshly lust is therefore inclusive of envy, jealousy,
   avarice, insatiable selfishness, and immoderate ambition. "Abstain from
   fleshly lusts," from any excessive heat which maintains its fire by
   consuming the furniture of the soul.

   Now, what is this but a plea for the ascendency of spirit? It is a plea
   for the magnificent passion of moderation, and for the imposing grace
   of a noble self-restraint. "Abstain from fleshly lusts." Do not let any
   fire get outside the bars. Do not let the flames reach the furniture.
   Hold everything in its place. Suffer no usurpation. Do not let the
   lower supplant the higher. Rigidly observe the distinction of subject
   and sovereign, and preserve the purity of the throne. Such is the
   all-inclusive meaning of the apostolic counsel. In the constitution of
   man there is a Divine order. His powers are arranged in ranks and
   gradations. The science of life is the doctrine of gradation; the art
   of living is the recognition of gradation. I suppose that George Combe
   did a great service to the cause of practical thinking when, seventy
   years ago, he wrote his work on The Constitution of Man. I am not aware
   that there was anything new in the philosophy of the book. It only
   confirmed the teaching of the entire range of philosophy stretching
   back from his own day to the days of Socrates and Plato. And what was
   the teaching? That the powers of the human personality are arranged in
   heightening gradation, and that the secret of beautiful living consists
   in awarding to each rank its own precise and peculiar value. The
   service rendered by George Combe consisted in the attempt to make this
   philosophy a plain, practical rule for common life. I find in the
   resources of my personality regiments of diverse, powers. I find vital
   forces, affectional forces, social forces, moral forces, spiritual
   forces. I find elements whose kinship is with the swine, and I find
   elements which have the lustre and the preciousness of pearls. "What is
   the art of successful and forceful living. "Give not that which, is
   holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine." Do not
   treat swine and pearls as though they were of equal value. Recognise an
   aristocracy among the powers, and to them give the preference and the
   sovereignty. When there are two calls in the life, the bark of the dog
   and a voice from the sanctuary, "give not that which is holy unto the
   dogs," but ever keep the lowest under the severe jurisdiction of the
   highest. "Abstain from fleshly lusts." Do not allow any lower power to
   prowl about in loose licentiousness. Keep the chain on. "Let your
   moderation be known unto all men." Exercise the ministry of a
   well-ordered life. Let all the powers in the life be well drilled, well
   disciplined, healthily ranked, each one in its place, from the private
   soldier up to the commander-in-chief. "Abstain from fleshly lusts." The
   primary characteristic of forceful, influential character is the
   ascendency of the spirit.

   [Verses 13, 14] "Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lord's
   sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; or unto governors, as sent
   by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to them that do
   well." That is the second element that tells--"Be subject to every
   ordinance . . . to the king . . . or unto governors!" Is there any
   suggestion of forcefulness in the counsel? It appears to indicate the
   .cringing obedience of boneless weaklings. I thought that the
   influential character was conspicuous for its beauty. Is there anything
   of beauty in this apparent servility? John Ruskin has told us that one
   of the primary elements of beauty is the element of repose. But he is
   careful to explain that by repose he does not mean the weak passivity
   of a pebble lying upon the highway, but the repose of a mountain, with
   its protruding rocks revealing themselves like gigantic muscles. It is
   repose suggestive of might, hinting of splendid power in reserve. May
   we translate the axiom into our interpretation of spiritual beauty?
   Spiritual beauty must not have the repose and passivity of a pebble: it
   must display muscle, and be suggestive of irresistible strength.
   Character that tells must be the ally of power. Its very sub missions
   must be indicative of strong nobility. Its bendings must not be the
   bendings of the invertebrate, but the voluntary, reasonable homage of a
   splendid will. What, then, is all this about, this submitting to
   ordinances and kings and governors? Whatever else it may mean, it is
   not the bending of reeds, but the devotion of giants. Here, I think, is
   the secret. A Christian man is one who clearly recognises the necessity
   of social order. The sanctity of society is a cardinal element in his
   faith. The hallowing of human relationship is not one whit behind the
   hallowing of himself. The ultimate purpose of redemption is to make an
   orderly family out of a disorderly race. The Christian will not stand
   aloof from his fellows. He will not walk the lonely way of isolation,
   or assume an attitude of selfish aggression. He will not maintain a
   stern individualism, in which the claims and rights of others are
   ignored. He will recognise the hallowedness of social fellowships, and
   he will strongly accept his social obligations. He will bend himself to
   the discharge of civic duties, and put his shoulder beneath the
   responsible burden of national life. He will fit himself into the
   social order, into the body corporate, and he will willingly share his
   blood in the common life.

   If this be evangelistic character, the character that tells upon "the
   Gentiles," then Christian life is not perfected and beautified where
   the hallowing of the social order is ignored. When civic duty is
   neglected, and national obligation is overlooked, the fair circle of
   spiritual devotion is broken. "Be subject to every ordinance of man for
   the Lord's sake . . . to the king . . . or unto governors." Bend your
   strength into an intelligent obedience which will be creative of a
   larger and more fruitful corporate life. I have no personal doubt as to
   what we should do with kings and governors if their rule minister to
   moral chaos and disorder. The sovereignty is only hallowed when it
   works to hallowed ends. If this predominant purpose is violated by the
   supreme king or governor, a man's very reverence for social sanctities
   will transform him into a rebel. It was because our fathers were
   possessed by hallowed civic instincts, and by a burning eagerness for
   pure and righteous corporate life, that they hurled Charles I. from the
   throne, and in his rejection and dethronement pledged their souls to a
   deepened devotion to the sovereignty of God. A primary characteristic
   of forceful, evangelistic character is the serious recognition of the
   sanctity of corporate life.

   "As free, and not using your freedom for a cloke of wickedness, but as
   bondservants of God." [Verse 16] Here is another aspect of the
   influential life--"Using your freedom . . . as bondservants." All
   privilege is used with a sense of responsibility. All exercise is taken
   "as ever in the great Task master's eye." No freedom is permitted to
   become licence. Every liberty is under the dominion of a fine
   restraint. "Why, a sense of responsibility and restraint is essential
   even to the appreciation of freedom itself. Restraint is always
   creative of refined perceptions, The ascetic can discern finer flavours
   than the glutton. The man who puts reins upon his appetite has a more
   delightful appreciation of his food. He must be a bondslave to
   appreciate his freedom. It is even so with every manner of freedom. It
   is only responsible exercise that discovers their luxurious essence.
   Licence, in any kind of freedom, works to coarseness, to injury, and to
   waste. Is this word altogether inopportune for our own day? Are there
   no alluring freedoms which may entice us into licence? Freedom of
   thought! "Use your freedom as the bondservants of God." No man has a
   right to think as he likes. No man has a right to think about the
   unworthy, or to contemplate the unclean. In the domain of the mind, it
   is the man who angles in narrow waters who has the wealthiest haul.
   Freedom of speech! "Use your freedom as the bondservants of God."
   Exercise it with severe restrictions. "Let no communication proceed out
   of your mouth but what is edifying." In all these freedoms the element
   of responsibility is the saving salt, and sometimes the element of
   responsibility will cause the freedom to be unused. If a man resign his
   freedom to take intoxicating drink that he may the better minister to
   an imperilled brother, I cannot but think that in reality he is no
   bondslave, but the Lord's freeman, and that his deed will not appear
   unworthy when it is placed in the searching rays of the Eternal Light.
   In the character that tells, the responsible use of freedom is a great
   and influential factor.

   "Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king."
   [Verse 17] "Honour all men!" The injunction includes the entire circle
   of human relationships. "Honour!" "Fear!" "Love!" What do the counsels
   mean except this--that our entire life is to be passed in the exercise
   of an all-inclusive reverence. We are to move about in the spirit of
   homage, expecting that at any time, and anywhere, we may come upon
   crowned sovereignties before which it will be well for us to bow in
   serious and grateful regard. If we are irreverent, monarchs will be
   continually passing us, but they will not be known. They will pass
   "like ships in the night." Reverence is the very spirit of perception.
   Frivolity has no eyes, and so it bestows no honour. Censoriousness is
   blind, and so is never aroused into love. Pride walks with a heavy
   veil. The cocksure never rest in the deep quietness of the Divine
   certainties. It is the man who walks in reverence, the man who feels
   the mystery of all things, whether he be contemplating common men or
   kings or God, who enters into the secret treasure-house, and discovers
   unsuspected wealth. We should see more in one another if the angel of
   reverence dwelt near the springs of our life. It is the man who stands
   in reverence before flowers, and little children, and his own loved
   ones, and his leaders, and his God, to whom are revealed the secret
   essences which turn life into a garden of unspeakable delights.

   These, then, are some of the characteristics of the "seemly behaviour,"
   which, working through the medium of holiness, proclaim the glory of
   God the ascendency of spirit, the aspiration after social sanctity, the
   responsible use of freedom, and the ceaseless exercise of reverence.
   These are the primary aspects of the forceful life which works mightily
   in the evangelisation of the world. As to what would be the issues of
   such a life the apostle proclaims a triumphant hope. "The Gentiles," [
   Verse 12] the great unleavened mass of men, "by your good works, which
   they behold," shall "glorify God in the day of visitation." The
   beautiful life is to raise their thoughts in homage to the glorious
   God. When they behold the Divine realised in the human, they too are to
   be wooed into heavenly fellowships. They are to be wooed, not by the
   eloquence of our speech, but by the radiance of our behaviour. By the
   imposing grace of noble living we are to "put to silence the ignorance
   of foolish men," [ Verse 15] and that silence will be for them the
   first stage in a life of aspiring consecration.

THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST

    1 Peter ii. 21-25

   For hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for you,
   leaving you an example, that ye should follow His steps: who did no
   sin, neither was guile found in His mouth: who, when He was reviled,
   reviled not again; when He suffered, threatened not; but committed
   Himself to Him that judgeth righteously: who His own self bare our sins
   in His body upon the tree, that we, having died unto sins, might live
   unto righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed. For ye were going
   astray like sheep; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of
   your souls.

   "Christ also suffered . . . who did no sin." [Verses 21, 22] The two
   phrases must be conjoined if either is to receive an adequate
   interpretation. The earlier term discloses its significance by the
   light of the later term. If we would know the content and intensity of
   the suffering, we must know the character of the sufferer. "Christ also
   suffered." [Verse 21] The word is indeterminate until I know the
   quality of His life. Suffering is a relative term. The measure of its
   acuteness is determined by the degree of our refinement. The same
   burden weighs unequally on different men. Lower organisation implies
   diminished sensitiveness The higher the organisation the finer becomes
   the nerve, and the finer the nerve the more delicate becomes the
   exposure to pain. The more exquisite the refinement, the more exquisite
   is the pang.

   I do not limit the principle to the domain of the flesh. It is a matter
   of familiar knowledge that in the body it is regnant. There are bodies
   in which the nerves seem atrophied or still-born, and there are bodies
   in which the nerves abound like masses of exquisitely sensitive pulp.
   But the diversity runs up into the higher endowments of the life, into
   the aesthetic and affectional and spiritual domains of the being. The
   man of little aesthetic refinement knows nothing of the aches and pains
   created by ugliness and discord. The rarer organisation is pierced and
   wounded by every jar and obliquity. It is even so in the realm of the
   affections. Where affection burns low, neglect and inattention are
   unnoticed; where love burns fervently, neglect is a martyrdom. If we
   rise still higher into the coronal dominions of the life, into the
   domain of moral and spiritual sentiments, we shall find that the degree
   of rectitude and holiness determines the area of exposure to the
   wounding, crucifying ministry of vulgarity and sin.

   "Christ also suffered . . . who did no sin." We must interpret the
   rarity and refinement of His spirit if we would even faintly realise
   the intensity of His sufferings. "Who did no sin, [Verse 22] neither
   was guile found in His mouth." "No sin!" The fine, sensitive membrane
   of the soul had in nowise been scorched by the fire of iniquity. "No
   sin!" He was perfectly pure and healthy. No power had been blasted by
   the lightning of passion. No nerve had been atrophied by the wasting
   blight of criminal neglect. The entire surface of His life was as
   finely sensitive as the fair, healthy skin of a little child. "Neither
   was guile found in His mouth." [Verse 22] There was no duplicity. There
   were no secret folds or convolutions in His life concealing ulterior
   motives. There was nothing underhand. His life lay exposed in perfect
   truthfulness and candour. The real, inner meaning of His life was
   presented upon a plain surface of undisturbed simplicity. "No sin!"
   Therefore nothing blunted or benumbed. "No guile!" Therefore nothing
   hardened by the effrontery of deceit. I ask you to try to imagine the
   immense area which such a life laid open to the wounding implements of
   un faithfulness and sin.

   Now, it is a Scriptural principle that all sin is creative of
   insensitiveness. "The wages of sin is death," deadened faculty,
   impaired perception. "His leaf shall wither!" Sin is a blasting
   presence, and every fine power shrinks and withers in the destructive
   heat. Every spiritual delicacy succumbs to its malignant touch. I
   suppose that Scripture has drawn upon every sense for analogies in
   which to express the ravages of sin in the region of perception. Sin
   impairs the sight, and works towards blindness. Sin benumbs the hearing
   and tends to make men deaf. Sin perverts the taste, causing men to
   confound the sweet with the bitter, and the bitter with the sweet. Sin
   hardens the touch, and eventually renders a man "past feeling." All
   these are Scriptural analogies, and their common significance appears
   to be this--sin blocks and chokes the fine senses of the spirit; by sin
   we are desensitised, rendered imperceptive, and the range of our
   correspondence is diminished. Sin creates callosity. It hoofs the
   spirit, and so reduces the area of our exposure to pain.

   "Who did no sin!" No part of His being had been rendered insensitive.
   No perception had been benumbed by any callous overgrowth. Put the
   slightest pressure upon the Master's life, and you awoke an exquisite
   nerve. "And they disputed one with another who should be greatest."
   . . . "And Jesus perceiving their thoughts!" How sensitive the
   perception! The touch of a selfish thought crushed upon the nerve, and
   stirred it into agony. Such is the sensitiveness of sinlessness, and in
   this vulgar, selfish, and sinful world it could not be but that the
   Sinless One should be "a Man of Sorrows," and that He should pass
   through pangs and martyrdoms long before He reached the appalling
   midnight of Gethsemane and Calvary. "Christ also suffered . . . who did
   no sin."

   Now, let us watch this sensitive Sufferer, so quick and apprehensive in
   every nerve, and let us contemplate the nature of some of the
   sufferings He endured. "He was reviled." [Verse 23] Give the word its
   requisite intensity. He was vilified, vituperated, slandered!" What was
   the shape of the reviling? He was denounced as a liar! "He deceiveth
   the people." Why, even with our blunt and benumbed consciousness, there
   is no charge like falsehood for tearing us with poignant pain. There is
   no word which pierces to the quick and stabs the very marrow, like the
   awful word "liar!" But to the Pure One, with His unimpaired perception,
   and in whose life the truth lay as fair and white as newly fallen snow,
   the charge of falsehood would create unutterable pain. "Christ also
   suffered," being reviled. What was the shape of the revilings? "This
   man blasphemeth!" This meek and lowly Being, walking ever in the stoop
   of reverence, seeking ever to be well pleasing to His Father, now
   charged, by those He came to save, with irreverent and sacrilegious
   speech. His sacred ministry belied as profanity! "He hath a devil, and
   is mad!" "He casteth out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of the
   devils!" This holy and sensitive Christ, whose one evangel was to tell
   men of His own sweet companionship with the Father, and whose one
   mission was to raise them into the delights of the same eternal
   fellowship, now charged with living in league with the devil, the evil
   despotism from which He sought to deliver them! It is the proof of our
   own benumbment if we do not feel that such accusations resulted in
   spiritual crucifixion. "He was reviled . . . He suffered." [Verse 23]
   The suffering covers the whole scope of the Passion, from the dull
   pangs of the physical crucifixion to the sharper and more terrible
   pangs of the crucifixion of the spirit. Now, I say, take this Man of
   the sinless, guileless life; let Him move amid the chaos of
   selfishness, the riot of lustfulness, the cruelty of thoughtlessness,
   the chilling insults of studied neglect and contempt; let Him be made
   the victim of incivility; let there be withheld from Him the common
   courtesies; let Him be denied the hospitable kiss, and the kindly gift
   of water for His tired feet; let rough men roughly handle Him; let them
   mock Him and deride Him; and as the very consummation of coarse
   vulgarity, let them go up to this Man of exquisite refinement, and spit
   in His face, and then let them subject Him to all the howling, laughing
   brutality of the crucifixion,--I say, watch all this, gaze steadily
   upon it, look long upon all its repellent offensiveness, and while you
   keep in mind the exquisite sensitiveness of the Sufferer, you will
   enter with a little more power of interpretation into that familiar
   cry, "Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto My sorrow!" "His
   visage was so marred more than any man." "He was a Man of Sorrows, and
   acquainted with grief."


   We may not know, we cannot tell,

   What pains He had to bear.

   How did the Lord endure His sufferings? "When He was reviled, He
   reviled not again." [Verse 23] The bitter attack was not creative of
   bitter retaliation. The hurled venom did not poison His springs. Amid
   the environing bitterness the Man of Nazareth remained sweet. I have
   sometimes heard bitter retaliation justified on the plea that even the
   sweetest milk will turn sour under the influence of a prolonged storm.
   I am doubtful of the accuracy of the physical analogy, but I am
   confident of the inaccuracy of the spiritual inference. It is possible
   for "the milk of human kindness" to be kept sweet in the most
   tempestuous weather. "When He was reviled, He reviled not again." Is
   the example too remote? Come down, then, from the high, cool altitudes
   of the Master's abode, and let us see if the milk can be kept sweet in
   the presumably more sultry vales of common men. Here is a man with a
   stormy, tempestuous life,--"in stripes above measure, in prisons more
   frequent. . . . Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save
   one. . . . Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned . . . in
   weariness, in painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in
   fastings often, in cold and nakedness!" Did the milk keep sweet? All
   these things he suffered of the Jews. When he was reviled, did he
   revile again? "I could wish myself accursed from Christ for my
   brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh!" "My heart's desire and
   prayer to God for Israel is, that they may be saved!" I thought that
   out of the heart of the tempest I might hear the angry shout of
   retaliation; instead of which I hear a sweet and self-forgetful prayer,
   sounding like silvery village bells in a night of storm. The spirit was
   not embittered. The milk was not soured. The apostle was just the
   Master over again. "When He suffered, He threatened not." [Verse 23]
   There was no violent menace in the Master's life. There was no dark,
   fateful hinting of a day of vengeance. There was no sullen, angry
   biding of His time for the season of retaliation. He remained quiet,
   unembittered, sweet, and "committed Himself," in happy confidence, and
   with ever-increasing assurance, "to Him that judgeth righteously."

   Such was the Sufferer, such were His sufferings, and such the way in
   which He endured them. What were the fruits of this transcendent
   endurance? If I were even to attempt to give an exhaustive reply to the
   great inquiry, I should have to quote the New Testament record from end
   to end. On every page one can find the enumeration and catalogue of the
   gracious fruits. Their proclamation is the New Testament glory. But
   just look at the pregnant summary given by the apostle Peter in the
   passage of our text. "Christ also suffered . . . that we might live."
   [Verse 24] What is the significance of the word? Out of His sufferings
   there issues a vital energy for the reviving and enlivening of the
   race. It is evidence whose testimony cannot be ignored that when the
   heart is crushed with sin, and is sinking under the burden, it turns
   its eyes to those scenes in the Saviour's life where His sufferings are
   most abounding. Men in whose vitals the poison of the devil is
   dwelling, and whose spiritual force is ebbing away, do not tarry at
   Bethlehem, or even upon the great Mount where the great teaching was
   given. They make their way to Gethsemane and Calvary. It is when we are
   feeling respectable that Calvary has no allurement. But when the heart
   is bleeding in unclean tragedy, when life ceases to be a debating
   society topic, a light subject of controversy for a quiet summer's eve,
   when the burden of sin weighs down upon us with heavy and intolerable
   load, it is then we follow the pilgrim band along the well-trodden way
   to Gethsemane and Calvary, that in the fellowship of the august
   Sufferer we might discover the vital energy of a restored and
   reinvigorated life. "Christ also suffered . . . that we might live."
   "By whose stripes ye were healed." [Verse 24] Do not let us overlook
   the experience because we cannot find an explanation. Do not let us
   reject the fact because we cannot contrive a theory. The sorest places
   in human life, the raw, festering wounds of indwelling sin, can only be
   remedially touched by the healing influence of His stripes. The miracle
   is repeated every day. The sufferer from sin turns for release to the
   suffering Christ. There is a strange allurement about "the Man of
   Sorrows " to which the common heart bears witness. "I, if I be lifted
   up, will draw all men unto Me!" The word proclaims the magnetic
   influence of the uplifted, suffering Christ. "Ye were going astray like
   sheep; but are now returned"; [Verse 25] ye have come home again, wooed
   and allured by the wondrous spectacle of a suffering God! Such are the
   issues of the calm endurance of this sensitive Sufferer--vital
   energies, full of reviving and healing ministry, wooing us back to God.

   And now this unspeakable ministry of suffering is proclaimed as an
   example to all men. "Christ also suffered, leaving you an example, that
   ye should follow His steps." [Verse 21] Do not let us shrink from the
   tremendous sequence. If the calm, strong endurance of the Master has
   been creative of transcendently blessed ministry, so our endurance will
   be productive of vital powers which will work for the enrichment of
   Verses the race. "Do well." [Verse 19-21] Have "conscience toward God."
   "Follow His steps." Let no revilings make thee desist, let no
   sufferings turn thee sour, and thy very endurance shall make thee a
   large contributor to the co-operative forces of the kingdom of God. To
   remain sweet under coarse reviling is to be a fountain of healing
   energy. To remain unselfishly prayerful in the presence of menace is to
   bring currents of heavenly air into the atmosphere of common life. All
   fine endurance is a force of renewal, which contributes its quota of
   energy to the ultimate emancipation of the race. I am glad that this
   superlative passage springs out of counsel to a slave. I am glad that
   these stupendous heights are connected by a well-made road with this
   very lowly estate. I am glad that the endurance of Jesus is placarded
   before a slave. The apostle tells the slave that he too may be an
   element and factor in the universal emancipation and redemption. The
   slave may accomplish more by calm endurance than by hasty, precipitate
   revolt. Fine, noble endurance is energy--an energy which raises the
   common temperature, and to raise the temperature will more effectively
   remove the burden of icy bondage than the hasty attacks of ten thousand
   men armed with the pickaxe of premature revolt. Let us do well; let us
   have conscience towards God; let us endure, if need be, the
   contradiction of sinners; let us persist even through sufferings, and,
   by the very nobility of our endurance, we shall be leavening the world
   with the emancipating forces of the Christian redemption. "Christ also
   suffered, leaving you an example." "The things which happened unto me
   have turned out rather unto the furtherance of the Gospel." "If we
   suffer we shall also reign with Him."

WIVES AND HUSBANDS

  1 Peter iii. 1-8

   In like manner, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that,
   even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be gained by
   the behaviour of their wives; beholding your chaste behaviour coupled
   with fear. Whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of
   plaiting the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on
   apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in the
   incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight
   of God of great price. For after this manner aforetime the holy women
   also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to
   their own husbands: as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose
   children ye now are, if ye do well, and are not put in fear by any
   terror. Ye husbands, in like manner, dwell with your wives according to
   knowledge, giving honour unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as
   being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your
   prayers be not hindered. Finally, be ye all likeminded, compassionate,
   loving as brethren, tenderhearted, humbleminded.

   WHERE shall we begin our interpretation of this influential passage?
   The starting-place of the exposition has much to do with the character
   and quality of its issues. Everybody knows the starting-place of a
   superficial and short-sighted curiosity. It fastens its primary
   attention upon the words "subjection," "fear," "obedience." These are
   the words which are regarded as the points of emphasis. Around these
   words the interest gathers and culminates. The rest of the broad
   passage is secondary, and takes its colour from their determination. I
   propose to reverse the order. We will begin with the broad significance
   of the passage, and then reason backwards to the content of the
   individual words. We will gaze upon the entire face, and then take up
   the interpretation of single features. If we begin with the words
   "subjection," "fear," "obedience," with no helpful clue of
   interpretation, we shall have a perverted and destructive conception of
   the dignity of womanhood. But if we begin with the broad, general
   portraiture of the wife and the husband, their mutual relationships
   will stand revealed as in the clear light of a radiant noon. In the
   passage for exposition the apostle delineates some of the spiritual
   characteristics of the ideal husband and the ideal wife. Let us quietly
   gaze at the portraiture, if perchance some of its beauty may steal into
   our spirits, and hallow common life with the light and glory of the
   blessed God.

   Where does the apostle begin in his portraiture of the ideal wife?
   "Chaste behaviour." [Verse 2] The first element in worthy womanhood is
   the wearing of the white robe. The spirit is perfectly clean. "The
   King's daughter is all glorious within." All her powers consort
   together like a white-robed angel-band. In every room of her life one
   can find the fair linen, "clean and white." In the realm of the
   imagination her thoughts hover and brood like white doves. In the abode
   of motive her aspirations are as sweet and pure as the breathings of a
   little child. In the home of feeling, her affections are as
   incorruptible as rays of light. If you move among the powers of her
   speech, on the threshold of her lips you will find no stain, no
   footprint of "anything that defileth or worketh abomination, or maketh
   a lie." In the inner life of the ideal woman, no unclean garment can be
   found, for everything wears the white robe. The spirit is "chaste." But
   chasteness is more than cleanliness. The stone is not only white, it is
   chiselled into delicacy. Character is not left in the rough; it is
   refined into thoughtful finish. The substance is not only pure, it is
   worked into beauty. It is not only true in matter, it is consummated in
   exquisite manner. If the analogy of purified womanhood is to be found
   in the whiteness of the snow, its finish is to be found in the graceful
   curves and forms of the snowdrift. "Chaste behaviour" is just the
   refined purity of all the activities of the inner life.

   Refined purity is therefore the primary element in the ideal wife, and
   it is the first essential in human communion. There can be no vital
   communion where both the communicants are not clean. "When dirt
   intrudes, fellowship is destroyed. Corruption is the antagonist of
   cohesion. "The wicked shall not stand." Their very uncleanness eats up
   the consistency and brings the structure to ruin. "When uncleanness
   breaks out in the family circle, the family cannot "stand." If envy
   take up its abode, or jealousy, or any type of carnal desire, the fair
   and beautiful circle is broken. The great family of the redeemed, "the
   multitude whom no man can number," are one in the wearing of the "white
   robe." Their consistency and solidarity are found in their purity, and
   in the absence of all the alienating forces of uncleanness and
   defilement. It is not otherwise in the relationship of husband and
   wife. The wearing of the white robe is the primary essential to their
   communion. "Keep thy garments always white"! Does the ideal appear
   insuperable? Then let me proclaim another word: "They shall walk with
   Me in white!" That is not a command; the words enshrine a promise.
   "Walking with Me, they shall be white." The whiteness is the result of
   the companionship. "I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall
   be clean." The sprinkling is not a transitory act; it is a permanent
   shower. The forces of the cleansing Spirit are sprayed upon our powers
   just as the antiseptic is sprayed upon the exposed wound to ward off
   and destroy the subtle forces of contamination and defilement. To be a
   companion of the Lord is to have the assurance of purity. "The fear of
   the Lord is clean."

   What is the second element in the portraiture Verse 4 of the ideal
   wife? "A meek and quiet spirit." [Verse 4] There is nothing cringing or
   servile in the disposition. It is infinitely removed from the
   saddening, paralysing obeisance of the slave. "I am meek," cries the
   Master; and can we detect anything fawning or fearful about the Son of
   Man? In the interpretation of the great word, let us eliminate from our
   minds every suggestion of servility and servitude. Meekness is just the
   opposite to self-aggressiveness and violent self-assertion. Meekness is
   just self-suppression issuing in beneficent service. Meekness does not
   tread the narrow path of a selfish ambition, tending only to some
   self-enriching end. Meekness takes broad, inclusive ways to large and
   unselfish ends. Meekness seeks the enrichment of life through the
   comprehension of the many. Self-assertion may appear to succeed, but it
   never really wins. It may gain a telescope, but it loses an eye. It may
   win an estate, but it loses the sense of the landscape. It may gain in
   goods what it loses in power. "It may gain the whole world, and lose
   its own soul." The meek are the only true "heirs." They gain an ever
   finer perceptiveness, and life reveals itself in richer perfumes and
   flavours and essences with every passing day. "The meek shall inherit
   the earth."

   "A meek and quiet spirit." A quiet spirit! The opposite to that which
   we describe as "loud." The "loud" woman is the ostentatious woman,
   moving about in broad sensations. "He shall not cry"; there was nothing
   loud about Him, quite an absence of the scream: "neither shall any man
   hear His voice in the streets"; there shall be nothing about Him of the
   artifice of self-advertisement. The Master was never "loud," and so He
   was a most winsome and welcome companion. The "loud" woman is never
   companionable. The difference between a "loud" woman and a woman of
   "quiet spirit" is the difference between fireworks and sunshine,
   between a quiet, genial glow and a crackling bonfire. The apostle
   contrasts the "quiet spirit" with the love of sensational attire and
   loud adornments, the disposition to arrest attention by vulgar dazzle
   and display. The disposition is a fatal foe to real communion. After
   all, we cannot bask in the glare of fireworks; we rejoice in the quiet
   sunlight. Home is made of quiet materials, and one of the elements in
   the constitution of beautiful wedded fellowship is "a meek and quiet
   spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price."

   What is the third element in the portraiture of the ideal wife? "Not
   put in fear by any terror" How shall I describe the disposition? Let me
   call it the grace of repose. "Not put in fear by any terror." [Verse 6]
   They are not the victims of "sudden, wild alarms." They are not easily
   aroused into the fearfulness which is so often the parent of
   thoughtlessness. They have reposefulness of spirit. Now, if I may be
   allowed to say it, I think this fearfulness is more characteristic of
   women than of men. There are larger enemies inside the gates of men's
   gardens; but in the garden of woman's life, I think that the heat of
   fearfulness and the slugs of worry and fretfulness will be found to be
   more abounding. Fearfulness is destructive of the deeper delights of
   human fellowship. Restfulness is essential to deep and fruitful
   communion.

   What are the lineaments of the ideal husband? "Dwell with your wives
   according to knowledge." [Verse 7] How shall we describe the
   characteristic? Let us call it the atmosphere of reasonableness.
   "According to knowledge." We may grasp its content by proclaiming its
   opposite: "Dwell with your wives according to ignorance. Just walk in
   blindness. Don't look beyond your own desires. Let your vision be
   entirely introspective and microscopic. Never exercise your eyes in
   clear and comprehensive outlook. Dwell in ignorance!" No, says the
   apostle, "dwell according to knowledge." Keep your eyes open. Let
   reason be alert and active. Let all your behaviour be governed by a
   sweet reasonableness. Don't let appetite determine a doing. Don't let
   thy personal wish have the first and last word. Exalt thy reason! Give
   sovereignty to thy reason! Be thoughtful and unceasingly considerate.
   It is the absence of this prevailing spirit of reasonableness which has
   marred and murdered many a bright and fair-promising communion. "He is
   not really bad at heart, but he doesn't think!" That is the fatal
   defect. He does not think! He dwells according to ignorance; his reason
   is asleep, and the beautiful, delicate tie of wedded fellowship is
   smitten, wounded, and eventually destroyed.

   "Giving honour unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel." [Verse 7]
   Giving honour, paying homage, bowing down in the spirit in the posture
   of serious and religious regard. To the atmosphere of reasonableness we
   are to add the temper of reverence. Now, see the wealthy suggestiveness
   of this. Reverence implies at least two things--perception and homage.
   "We must first see a thing before we can pay it regard. We must first
   behold a dignity before we can pay homage to it. Homage implies
   perception: perception implies eyes. How are the seeing eyes obtained?
   Let us lay this down as an axiom: it is only the lofty in character
   that can discern the spiritual dignities in life. Men of little nature
   cannot apprehend spiritual magnitudes. John Ruskin has told his
   countrymen that they are incapable of depicting and portraying the
   sublime, because they cannot see it! You know his explanation. He says
   there is in the Englishman's character an element of burlesque which
   has shortened and dimmed his sight, and rendered him in capable of
   discerning the superlative glories of far-off spiritual heights.
   Whatever may be the quality of the inference, the basal principle is
   true. Perception implies elevation, and we cannot see the enduring
   dignities of life unless we ourselves are dignified. To truly revere a
   woman, a man himself must be good. He must dwell on high. He must abide
   in the heavenly places in Christ. He must bathe his eyes in heaven, and
   he will acquire a power of perception which will discern in his wife,
   and in all womankind, spiritual dignities which will preserve his soul
   in the abiding posture of lowly and reverent regard. The husband will
   see in his wife a "joint-heir of the grace of life," [Verse 7] and in
   that perception every relationship is hallowed and enriched. The master
   who sees in his servant a "joint-heir of the grace of life," and the
   servant who perceives in his master a similarly enthroned dignity, will
   create between themselves a relationship which will be the channel of
   "the river of the water of life." "Give honour unto the woman," and to
   preserve that sense of reverent perceptiveness, a man must dwell in
   "the secret place of the most High."

   "What is the last lineament in this ideal portraiture? How else must
   the husband live? "That your payers be not hindered." [Verse 7] His
   conduct has to be the helpmeet of his prayers. There has to be no
   discord between the one and the other. The spirit of his supplications
   is to be found in his behaviour. When he has been into the garden of
   the Lord in lonely communion, the fragrance of the flowers has to cling
   to his garments when he moves about in the common life of the home.
   Here is a man, living out his own prayers, taking the spirit of his
   communion into ordinary conduct, so demeaning himself that his highest
   aspirations may receive fulfilment. "Whatever he prays for he seeks to
   be, finding a pertinent duty in every supplication. "Who would not
   covet such a companionship? The character of the ideal husband is just
   a beautiful commingling of reasonableness and reverence, manifesting
   itself in conduct which is in harmony with the range and aspirations of
   his prayers.

   Here, then, are the spiritual portraitures of the wife and the husband:
   on the one hand, the robe of purity, the ornament of modesty, the grace
   of repose; on the other hand, an atmosphere of reasonableness, the
   temper of reverence, and the conformity of conduct and prayer. What,
   now, in the light of such relationships, can be the content of such
   terms as "subjection," "obedience," "fear"? The partners are a wife,
   clothed in purity, walking in modesty, with a reposefulness of spirit
   which reflects the very glory of God; and a husband, walking with his
   wife according to knowledge, bowing before her in reverence, and
   pervading all his behaviour with the temper of his secret communion
   with the Lord. There is no room for lordship, there is no room for
   servility. The subjection of the one is paralleled by the reverence of
   the other. I say there is no lordship, only eager helpfulness; there is
   no subjection, only the delightful ministry of fervent affection. The
   relationship is a mutual ministry of honour, each willing to be lost in
   the good and happiness of the other. Wherefore, "subject yourselves one
   to the other in the fear of Christ," that in the communion of
   sanctified affection you may help one another into the light and joy
   and blessedness of the Christian.

BE PITIFUL

  1 Peter iii. 8

   Finally, be ye all likeminded, compassionate, loving as brethren,
   tenderhearted, humbleminded.

   "BE PITIFUL!" Here the standard of authority is set up in the realm of
   sentiment, and obedience is demanded in the domain of feeling! I did
   not anticipate that the Christian imperative would intrude into the
   kingdom of the feelings. I thought that feelings would lie quite
   outside the sphere of authority. I thought that feelings could not be
   made to order, and yet here is an order in which their creation is
   commanded! "Be pitiful!" I could have understood a commandment which
   dealt with the external incidents and manifestations of life. I should
   not have been surprised had there been laid upon me the obligation of
   hospitality--hospitality may be commanded. But then, hospitality need
   not touch the border lands of feeling. Hospitality may be generous and
   plentiful, and yet noble and worthy feeling may be absent. Hospitality
   may be a matter of form, and therefore it can be done to order. I
   should not have been surprised had I been commanded to show
   beneficence. Beneficence may be exercised while sentiment is numb. It
   is possible to have such a combination as callous prodigality.
   Beneficence may therefore be created by authority. But here in my text
   the imperative command enters the secret sanctuary of feeling. It is
   not concerned with external acts: it is concerned with internal
   disposition. It is not primarily a service which is commanded, but a
   feeling. But can feelings be made to order? Charity can: can pity?
   Labour can: can love? "This is My commandment, that ye love one
   another." "Love one another with a pure heart fervently." "Be kindly
   affectioned one to another." "Be pitiful." The order is clear and
   imperative: can I obey it? Authority commands me to be pitiful: then
   can pity be created by an immediate personal fiat? Can I say to my
   soul, "Soul, the great King commands thee to be arrayed in pity; bring
   out, therefore, the tender sentiment and adorn thyself with it as with
   a robe"? Or can a man say to himself, "Go to; this day I will array
   myself in love, and I will distribute influences of sweet and pure
   affection! I will unseal my springs of pity, and the gentle waters
   shall flow softly through all my common affairs"? Such mechanicalised
   affection would have no vitality, and such pity would be merely
   theatrical--of no more reality or efficacy than the acted pity of the
   stage. Feelings cannot rise matured at the mere command of the will.

   But, now, while I may not be able to produce the sentiment of pity by
   an act of immediate creation, can I rear it by a thoughtful and
   reasonable process? I cannot create an apple, but I can plant an
   apple-tree. I cannot create a flower, but I can create the requisite
   conditions. I can sow the seed, I can give the water, I can even
   arrange the light. I can devote to the culture thoughtful and ceaseless
   care; and he who sows and plants and waters and tends is a
   fellow-labourer with the Eternal in the creation of floral beauty. What
   we cannot create by a fiat we may produce by a process. It is even so
   with the sentiments. Feelings cannot be effected at a stroke; they
   emerge from prepared conditions. Pity is not the summary creation of
   the stage; it is the long-sought product of the school. It is not the
   offspring of a spasm; it is the child of discipline. Pity is the
   culmination of a process; it is not stamped as with a die, it is grown
   as a fruit. The obligation therefore centres round about the process;
   the issues belong to my Lord. Mine is the planting, mine the watering,
   mine the tending; God giveth the increase. When, therefore, I hear the
   apostolic imperative, "Be pitiful!" I do not think of a stage, I think
   of a garden; I do not think of a manufactory, I think of a school.

   Let us now consider the process. "Be pitiful!" That is the expression
   of a fine feeling; and if life is to be touched to such exquisite
   issues, life itself must be of fine material. Fine characteristics
   imply fine character. You will not get fine porcelain out of
   pudding-stone. The exquisiteness of the result must be hidden in the
   original substance. If you want rare issues, you must have fine organic
   quality. Some things are naturally coarser than others, and there are
   varying scales of refinement in their products. The timber that would
   make a good railway sleeper would not be of the requisite texture for
   the making of violins. I saw, only a little while ago, the exposed
   hearts of many varieties of Canadian timber. In some the grain was
   coarse and rough; in others the grain was indescribably close and
   compact, presenting a surface almost as fine as the rarest marble.
   Their organic qualities were manifold, and their destinations were as
   manifold as their grain. Some passed to rough-and-tumble usage; others
   passed to the ministry and expression of the finest art. These organic
   distinctions are equally pronounced when we ascend to the plane of
   animal life. The differing grains of timber find their analogy in the
   differing constitutions of an ordinary dray-horse and an Arab steed.
   You cannot harness the two beasts to the same burden and work. The
   sensitive responsiveness of the one, its quivering, trembling
   alertness, makes it fitted for ministries in which the other would find
   no place. It is again the repetition of the chaste porcelain and the
   common mug. It is not otherwise when we reach the plane of man. There
   is the same difference in grain. Our organic qualities are manifold.
   Look at the difference in our bodies. Some have bodies that are coarse
   and rough, dull and heavy, with little or no fine apprehension of the
   beauty and perfume and essences of the material world. Others have
   bodies of the finest qualities, alert and sensitive, responding readily
   to the coming and going of the exquisite visitors who move in sky or
   earth, on land and sea. In our bodies we appear to differ as widely as
   Caliban and Ariel--the thing of the ditch, and the light and buoyant
   creature of the air. Now, dare we push our investigation further? Do
   these organic differences appertain to the realm of the soul? Are there
   not souls which seem to be rough-grained, organically and spiritually
   coarse? The very substance of their being, the basis of motive and
   thought and feeling and ambition, is inherently vulgar, and they seem
   incapable of these finer issues of tender pity and chaste affection.
   Now, where character is rough-grained fine sentiments are impossible.
   You can no more elicit pity from vulgarity than you can elicit
   Beethoven's Sonatas from undressed cat-gut. If we would have fine
   issues, we must have rare character. If we would have rare pity, we
   must become refined men.

   "What, then, can be done? Can we do anything in the way of culture? Can
   the organic quality be changed? Can we make coarseness retire before
   the genius of refinement? It is surprising how much we can do in the
   kingdom of nature. By assiduous care we can transform the harsh and
   rasping crab-apple into the mild and genial fruit of the table; and we
   can, by persistent neglect, drive it back again into the coarseness of
   the wilderness. It is amazing how you can bring a grass-plot under
   discipline, until even the rank grass seems to seek conformity with the
   gentler turf; and it is equally amazing how by neglect and indifference
   you can degrade a lawn into a common field. In the realm of garden and
   field organic qualities can be changed. Does the possible
   transformation cease when we reach the kingdom of man? Can dull and
   heavy bodies be refined? Is it possible to alter the organic quality of
   a man's flesh? It is much more possible than the majority of people
   assume. By thoughtful exercise, by reasonable diet, by firm restraint,
   by "plain living and high thinking," it is possible to drive the
   heaviness out of our bodies, and to endow them with that organic
   refinement which will be the revealing minister of a new world. Can the
   transformation proceed further? Let me propound the question which is
   perhaps one of the greatest questions that can come from human lips: Is
   it possible to go into the roots and springs of character, into the
   primary spiritual substance which lies behind thought and feeling, and
   change the organic quality of the soul? If this can be done, the
   creation of pity is assured! If the coarse fibres of the soul can be
   transformed into delicate harp-strings, we shall soon have the sweet
   and responsive music of sympathy and affection! Can it be done? Why,
   this transformation is the very glory of the Christian evangel! What do
   we want accomplishing? We want the secret substance of the life
   chastened and refined, that it may become vibratory to the lives of our
   fellows. What think you then of this evangel? "He sits as a refiner."
   And what is the purpose of the Refiner? Let the Apostle Paul supply the
   answer, "We are renewed by His Spirit in the inner man." The Refiner
   renews our basal spiritual sub stance, takes away our drossy
   coarseness, and makes our spirits the ministers of refinement. And what
   are the conditions of obtaining refinement? The conditions are found in
   communion: "His Spirit in the inner man": it is fellowship between man
   and his Maker; it is the companionship of the soul and God. All lofty
   communion is refining! All elevated companionships tend to make me
   chaste! What, then, must be the transforming influence of the
   companionship of the Highest? We can see its ministry in the lives of
   the saints. Lay your hand upon any one, man or woman, who walks in
   closest fellowship with the risen Lord, and you will find that the
   texture of their life is as the choicest porcelain, compared with which
   all irreligious lives are as coarse and common clay. By communion with
   the Divine we become "partakers of the Divine nature." In fellowship we
   find the secret of spiritual refinement, and in spiritual refinement
   are found the springs of sympathy. To be pitiful we must become good.
   Our pity is born of our piety.

   But there is a second step in the process to which I must briefly
   direct your thought. It is not enough to be organically refined.
   Refined faculties must be exercised. A man may have a brain of very
   rare organic quality, and yet the particular function of the brain may
   be allowed to remain inactive and immature. It is not enough for me to
   become spiritually refined; I must exercise my refined spirit in the
   ministry of a large discernment. Now, for the creation of a wise and
   ready sympathy, there is no power which needs more continuous use than
   the power of the Imagination. I sometimes think, looking over the wide
   breadths of common life, that there is no faculty which is more
   persistently denied its appropriate work. "Look not every man on his
   own things, but every man also on the things of others." Such vision
   calls for the exercise of the imagination. "Put yourself in his place."
   Such transposition demands the ministry of the imagination. If the
   imagination be not exercised, we offer hospitality to the shrieking
   sisterhood of bigotry and intolerance. If a pure and refined
   imagination had been at work, how could an Anglican clergyman have
   declared that the Nonconformists are "in mad alliance with Anarchists"?
   And if a refined imagination had been in exercise, how could a
   Nonconformist have spoken of the Bishops as "caring little for the
   cause of Christ so long as they could suffocate Dissenters"? How much a
   refined imagination would have helped in the mutually sympathetic
   understanding of Pro-Boers and Anti-Boers? When this faculty is
   sleeping, evil things are very much awake! But for my immediate purpose
   I am asking for the exercise of the imagination in respect to things
   which would be otherwise insignificant. Imagination is second sight.
   Imagination is the eye which sees the unseen. Imagination does for the
   absent what the eye does for the present. Imagination does for the
   distant what the eye does for the near. The eye is concerned with
   surfaces; imagination is busied with depths. The dominion of the eye
   terminates at the horizon; at the horizon, imagination begins.
   Imagination is the faculty of realisation; it takes a surface and
   constructs a cube; it takes statistics, and fashions a life. Here is a
   surface fact: "Total of patients treated in the Queen's Hospital during
   1901, 31,064." The eye observes the surface fact and passes on, and
   pity is unstirred. The imagination pauses at the surface, lingers long,
   if perchance she may comprehend something of its saddening
   significance. Imagination turns the figures over; 31,064! Then these
   afflicted folk would fill twenty buildings, each of them the size of
   the chapel at Carrs Lane. Says Imagination, "I will marshal the
   pain-ridden, bruised crowd in procession, and they shall pass my window
   and door, one a minute, one a minute, one a minute! How long will it
   take the procession to pass? Twenty-one days!" But what of the units of
   the dark and tearful procession? Imagination gets to work again. Have
   you a child down? They are like him. Have you a brother falling, or a
   sister faint and spent? They are like them. Have you known a mother
   torn and agonised with pain, or a father crushed and broken in his
   prime? They are like him. Have you gone down the steep way to the
   death-brink, and left a loved one there? Some of these, too, have been
   left at the brink, and their near ones are climbing up the steep way
   again alone! This is how refined imagination works, and, while she
   works, her sister, Pity, awakes and weeps! But if pity is not to be
   smothered again, the aroused impulse must be gratified and fed. I know
   that pity can give "ere charity begins," but charity confirms pity, and
   strengthens and enriches it. Feelings of pity, which do not receive
   fulfilment in charity or service, may become ministers of petrifaction.
   Let our piety be the basis of our pity; let our imagination extend our
   vision; and from this area of hallowed out look there will arise rivers
   of gracious sympathy, abundantly succouring the children of pain and
   grief.

CHRIST SANCTIFIED AS LORD

  1 Peter iii. 8-15

   Finally, be ye all likeminded, compassionate, loving as brethren,
   tenderhearted, humbleminded: not rendering evil for evil, or reviling
   for reviling; but contrariwise blessing; for hereunto were ye called,
   that ye should inherit a blessing. For, He that would love life, and
   see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that
   they speak no guile: and let him turn away from evil, and do good; let
   him seek peace, and pursue it. For the eyes of the Lord are upon the
   righteous, and his ears unto their supplication: but the face of the
   Lord is upon them that do evil. And who is he that will harm you, if ye
   be zealous of that which is good? But and if ye should suffer for
   righteousness sake, blessed are ye: and fear not their fear, neither be
   troubled; but sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord: being ready
   always to give answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning
   the hope that is in you, yet with meekness and fear.

   "Sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord." [Verse 15] The heart is a
   sanctuary. It is a place of worship. Worship is always proceeding.
   There is a large congregation. Who are the worshippers? Let me name a
   few. There are our wishes, our ambitions, our motives, our willings.
   All these are worshippers, bowing in the heart before some enthroned
   and sovereign Lord. Our dispositions are also among the crowd. All the
   forces of thought and feeling are mingled in the varied congregation!
   Go into the sanctuary of any heart, and you will find, kneeling side by
   side in homage and obeisance, wishes, motives, sentiments, purposes,
   dispositions, all bowing before some central shrine. "Who is the Lord
   of the temple? In some temples it is Mammon! He is sanctified as Lord,
   and round him are kneeling the congregated thoughts, passions, and
   ambitions, offering him incense, supplication, and praise. Who is the
   Lord? In some temples it is the Lord of Misrule. He is sanctified as
   Lord! Chaos reigns, and in riotous disorder the mob of tumultuous
   thoughts and feelings offer him noisy acclamation. Who is the Lord of
   the temple? In some temples indifference is en throned. Indifference is
   sanctified as Lord! The atmosphere is opiated; life is a lounge;
   everything comes and goes in carelessness; all the worshippers are
   narcotised in thoughtlessness, or sunk in profound and perilous sleep.
   Who is the Lord of the temple? In some temples it is the devil. Every
   worshipper bends in adoration of vice, reciting the liturgy of
   uncleanness, and every member of the congregation, every thought, every
   feeling, every ambition, bears upon its forehead the mark of the beast.
   Who is the Lord of the temple? In some temples it is the Christ. All
   the assembled forces and powers of the life willingly prostrate
   themselves in fervent and lowly worship. Every hour of the day there is
   a worshipper in the radiant temple! Now it is a wish, now a shaping
   plan, now a completed purpose, now a penitent feeling, now a gay
   delight--these all stoop in reverent homage before the exalted Christ,
   and as we always appropriate the worth of the object we worship, the
   bending congregation of thoughts and sentiments acquire the beauty of
   the Lord. The worshipping motive is chastened and refined; the kneeling
   wish is etherealised; the stooping sorrow is transfigured; all the
   reverent forces of the personality are transformed into children of
   light. Who is the Lord in the temple? That is the all-determining
   question. "Sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord." In your temple let
   the Christ be enthroned. Let everything in the life be made to kneel in
   that sanctuary. Bring ye everything to the foot of the great white
   throne. Let the Lord be King!" Little children, keep yourselves from
   idols."

   "Sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord." [Verse 15] That is the
   creative centre of the passage. All the surrounding context is
   resultant and consequent. This is the all-originating fountain! Around
   it are stretches of land, threaded with rivers which are the children
   of its creative springs. Let us pass from the springs to the rivers. If
   Christ be sanctified in the heart as Lord, if everything in the deep,
   secret places of the life bow before His throne, if at Matins and
   Evensong, and through all the intervening hours of the day, the endless
   procession of mystic forces in the soul reverently bend to His
   dominion, what will be the quality of the issues, what will be the
   striking characteristics of the life?

   Are you surprised that the apostle's answer begins with an enumeration
   of the softer graces: "compassionate, tenderhearted, humbleminded"?
   [Verse 8] Did you anticipate that he would begin with attributes more
   majestic, more manly and commanding? Is it disappointing that the
   apostle should give emphasis to graces which we commonly associate with
   women rather than with men? I have called them the softer graces;
   perhaps I ought to have called them the riper fruit. The ultimate
   expression of the strongest tree is its sweetest and ripest fruit. The
   tender, exquisite colour of a ripening acorn is the finest expression
   of the oak. Hearts of oak reach their finished achievement in the
   softest hues of their ripest fruit. Manliness is never perfected until
   it issues in tenderest grace. Therefore I am not surprised to find the
   apostle giving prominence to the finished and ripened attainments in
   sanctified life. What, again, are their names?

   "Compassion" [Verse 8] The range of a man's life is just the range of
   his compassions, which is only another name for the range of his
   correspondences. Death is just the destruction of all correspondence.
   The dying lose correspondence after correspondence; nerve after nerve
   and sense after sense collapse; communications are slowly broken; and
   by gradual paralysis and benumbment all correspondences end. The
   measure of my life is determined by the quality and quantity of my
   correspondences. This is true of the life of the flesh. It is true in
   the realm of the mind. How much am I in touch with? What is the range
   of my interests? What are my correspondences? It is true in the domains
   of the soul. How much do I live? That depends upon my compassion, my
   responsiveness, my "correspondence." What is the extent of my
   fellow-feeling? What is my power of apprehending and realising my
   brother, and by the ministry of an unveiling imagination planting
   myself in the heart of his interests and estate? That is one of the
   rarest attainments in the sanctified life. The Lord refines His
   disciples into compassionateness. He indefinitely enlarges their
   correspondences. He endows them with sensitive passion, with profundity
   of feeling. "Deep calleth unto deep," and they maintain fruitful
   fellowship with the joys and sorrows of their fellow-men.

   "Tenderheartedness." [Verse 8] That carries one a step further than
   compassion. Tenderheartedness is more than correspondence; it is gentle
   ministry. It includes the service of the tender hand, it not only feels
   the pains of others; it touches the wounds with exquisite delicacy.
   Even the pitiful man can be clumsy. Six men may have the sympathy, but
   only one of the six may be able to touch the wound so as to heal it.
   The Lord will add a gentle hand to our compassion. He will take away
   all brusqueness, all spiritual clumsiness, so that in the very ministry
   of pity we may not "break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking
   flax."

   "Humblemindedness" [Verse 8] Surely that adds a still richer bloom to
   the heavenly grace! The Lord will not only give us a heart of
   compassion; it shall be compassion rid of all brusqueness; it shall
   also be purged of all superciliousness and pride! It shall be
   "humbleminded." Even pity may wear some of the garments of pride! There
   is something bitter and offensive in all compassion which moves in
   patronage. The Man whose "compassions failed not" was "meek and lowly
   in heart!" Pity is petrifying when it comes from pride; it is soothing
   and healing when it flows from the humble mind, and this is the
   perfected grace of the sanctified life.

   "Not Tendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but
   contrariwise blessing." [Verse 9] Surely that is the perfection of
   compassion! Compassion may go out on chivalrous errands with sensitive
   hands and lowly mind, and may meet with ingratitude and angry rebuff
   from those whom she seeks to serve. When the one we have been
   compassionately nursing turns and reviles us, and treats our ministry
   with contempt, how easy it is to become sour and hard, to return
   reviling for reviling, and to throw up the knightly service with
   disgust! But the Lord will so perfect the compassion that even in the
   midst of reviling it will continue in "blessing," and in atmospheres of
   ingratitude and contempt will toil on in the ministry of "healing them
   that are bruised." What say you now to these softer graces, these riper
   fruits of the sanctified life? Are they not a resplendent issue? He who
   continually, in his heart, sanctifies Christ as Lord, becomes possessed
   by a compassion which moves in delicate sensitiveness, and in
   humblemindedness, and which remains sweet and persistent in hostile
   atmospheres of murmuring and contempt.

   Now let us turn to the sterner products of the sanctified life. Let us
   turn to the hearts-of-oak of which the softer graces are the perfected
   fruit. Let us contemplate the severer virtues, the more commanding
   strength.

   "Zealous of that which is good." [Verse 13] That sounds suggestive of
   strength! "Clarify your conception of duty! Get it clearly in your eye!
   Set the good firmly before you! Then be zealous!" Such is the strong,
   definite virtue which is the fruit of the sanctified life. "Zealous of
   the good!" You will get the native energy of the word "zealous" if you
   recall its kinsman "jealous." It is significant of consuming eagerness
   and ceaseless vigilance. It is suggestive of burning passion. There
   towers the "good!" The "zealous" soul confronts it, not with faint and
   timid aspiration, but possessed by a blazing and driving ambition! The
   strength of his passion is the measure of his defence. You may play
   tricks with a candle-flame; you must give margin to a bonfire. You may
   trifle with the lukewarm; who would try it on with the zealot? You may
   carry an evil suggestion to one man, and quite unembarrassed you may
   lay it across the threshold of his mind. You may take the suggestion to
   another man, and before you have got out of the preface you are
   scorched and consumed. There are lives so sanctified by the indwelling
   Christ that they blight all evil approaches, and cause them to wither
   away. Their fire is their defence. That is a wonderful figure employed
   by the prophet--"clad with zeal as a cloak." The man wears a protective
   garment of fire! He is secured in his own enthusiasms! He is preserved
   in the spirit of burning. Now, that burning passion for "that which is
   good "is one of the strengths of the sanctified life. "Why, our very
   word "enthusiasm," which is now suggestive of ardour, passion, fire,
   had no such significance in its earliest day. It literally signifies
   "in God," and it is because men have found that souls which are united
   with God are characterised by zeal and fire, that the word has lost its
   causal content, and is now limited to the description of the effect.
   The enthusiastic is the fiery, but fiery because in fellowship with
   God. "He shall baptize . . . with fire." One of the resultant virtues
   of sanctification is spiritual enthusiasm, a zeal for "that which is
   good."

   "Suffering for righteousness sake." [Verse 14] That sounds like a
   masculine virtue! It is a phrase which unveils a little more of the
   firm strength of this spiritual ambition! The zealot goes right on,
   with "the good" as his goal, suffering loss, if need be, of ease and
   comfort and wealth and fame, and counting the loss as "blessed" if only
   it help him in the way of spiritual attainment, This is the character
   of spiritual enthusiasts! We may reserve for such character whatever
   criticism we please, we cannot deny it the eulogium of "strength." At
   any rate it is not weak and effeminate. There is something about it
   granitic and majestic! Christ Jesus makes men and women who despise
   ease, who are "ready to be offered," who will plod through toils and
   pains and martyrdom if these lie in the way of duty and truth. Only a
   few months ago our little chapels outside Pekin were destroyed by the
   Boxers, and the majority of the native Christians foully murdered. The
   chapels are being erected again. I have read the account of the opening
   of one of these restored sanctuaries. And who took part in the
   reopening? The remnant of the decimated church! Men stood there whose
   wives and children had been butchered in the awful carnival; there they
   stood, their love undimmed, their faith unshaken, themselves "ready to
   be offered" in their devotion to the Lord! I say, give to it any
   criticism you please, you cannot deprive it of the glory of superlative
   strength! "They rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer shame
   for His name." That is the product of the sanctified life. The Lord
   lifts us above the common fear. See how the passage proceeds: "And fear
   not their fear, neither be troubled." [Verse 14] That is the
   characteristic which is even now shining resplendently in the lives of
   the native Christians in China. They have been gloriously delivered
   from common fear and distraction. They are fearless and collected,
   quietly prepared to "suffer for righteousness sake," and strongly
   holding on the way of life, "zealous of that which is good." "Unto them
   it is given on the behalf of Christ, not only to believe in His name,
   but also to suffer for His sake."

   Now, let me sum up my exposition. The fruits of the sanctified life are
   to be found in the tender graces and in commanding virtues, in
   compassion, sensitive and humbleminded, and in moral and spiritual
   enthusiasm which is perfectly devoid of fear. Now, do you not think
   that where these soft compassions flow and these sterner virtues
   dwell--river and rock--a man will be able to "give answer to every man
   that asketh a reason concerning the hope that is in him"? [Verse 15]
   The finest reason a man can give for a spiritual hope is a spiritual
   experience. What have I seen, and heard, and felt, and known? In these
   experiences I shall find invincible reasons in days of inquiry and
   controversy. If a man has sanctified in his heart Christ as Lord, and
   discovers that his hardness has been softened into gracious sympathies,
   that his coldness towards the right has been changed into passionate
   enthusiasm, and that his trembling timidities have given place to firm
   and fruitful fearlessness, has he not a splendid answer to give to
   every man who asketh him a reason concerning the hope that is in him?
   The answer does not peep out in an apologetic "perhaps" or a trembling
   "if"; it is a masculine "verily," a confident "I know." As to the
   issues of such an answer the apostle is clear. A vital testimony is
   invincible. Fine living is not only a fine argument, it is the only
   effective silencer of bad men. "They will be put to shame who revile
   your good manner of life in "Christ." Men may more than match you in
   subtlety of argument. In intellectual controversy you may suffer an
   easy defeat. But the argument of a redeemed life is unassailable.
   "Seeing the man that was healed standing with them, they could say
   nothing against it."

BRINGING US TO GOD

  1 Peter iii. 18-22

   Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous,
   that He might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but
   quickened in the spirit; in which also He went and preached unto the
   spirits in prison, which aforetime were disobedient, when the long
   suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a
   preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:
   which also after a true likeness doth now save you, even baptism, not
   the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the interrogation of a
   good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ;
   who is on the right hand of God, having gone into heaven; angels and
   authorities and powers being made subject unto Him.

   THE concluding passage of this great chapter is like a landscape in the
   uncertain light of the early morning. Here and there the black shadows
   still linger and prolong the night. The hollows are filled with mist. A
   prevailing dimness possesses the scene. From only a few things has the
   veil dropped, and their lineaments are seen in suggestive outline. On
   the whole, we are dealing with obscure hints, with partial unveilings,
   which awaken wonder, rather than convey enlightenment. Perhaps, in the
   present stage of our pilgrimage, an open-eyed wonder is more fruitful
   than an assurance begotten of broader light. Assurance may nourish
   sluggishness; an expectant wonder disciplines the powers to a rare
   perceptiveness. But amid all the indefiniteness of the revelation,
   there are two or three visions which are sufficiently clear to enrich
   our thought and life. We have glimpses of the Lord in a threefold
   activity. We see Him engaged in His redemptive work among men upon
   earth: "Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the
   unrighteous, that He might bring us to God." [Verse 18] We behold Him
   ministering to spirits who have left the sphere of earth, but who are
   not yet in reconciled fellowship with their God. "He went and preached
   unto the spirits in prison." [Verse 19] And we see Him again on the
   throne of His glory receiving the willing and jubilant homage of the
   mystic powers who surround the sovereignty of God. "He is on the right
   hand of God . . . angels and authorities and powers being made subject
   unto Him." [Verse 22] Let us contemplate these three relationships.

   "Christ also suffered for sins ONCE." [Verse 18] There is a reference
   to some distinct and definite historical event. To the apostle there
   was a certain nameable season when our redemption was achieved. The
   sufferings of the Master were infinitely more than momentary incidents,
   reflecting the permanent mood of God. Christ's sufferings were
   altogether unique. They were paralleled by no previous happenings, and
   they would never be repeated. "Christ suffered for sins once";
   something was done, done "once," and done for ever. Therefore,
   Gethsemane and Calvary are gravely and uniquely significant. They are
   more than the tempestuous ending of a noble and laborious life. Behind
   their appalling externalities there are more appalling conditions.
   Behind the loneliness of the garden there is the more awful loneliness
   of the soul. Behind the blackness of Calvary there is the deeper
   darkness of the spirit. The real movements of redemptive ministry are
   not to be witnessed in the material setting of the Crucifixion. The
   human and material environment of the Master's death has dominated our
   thought too much. I do not think that the material incidents of
   Gethsemane and Calvary were essential to our redemption. I believe that
   if Christ had never been betrayed by one of the twelve, He would still
   have died for our sins. I believe that if He had never suffered the
   brutal accompaniments of mockery and blasphemy, and the loathsome
   coarseness of contemptible men, He would still have died for our sins.
   I believe that if He had never been crucified, He would still have died
   for our sins. I believe that if He had finished His ministry in public
   acclamation, instead of public contempt, He would still have passed
   into outer darkness, into an un thinkable loneliness, into a terrible
   midnight of spiritual forsakenness and abandonment. He came to die,
   came to pass into the night which is "the wages of sin," and what we
   men did was to add to His death the pangs of contempt and crucifixion.

   "Christ suffered for sins once." But could not sin have been forgiven
   without the sufferings? Could not sin have been forgiven without
   abandonment? Might we not have had our forgiveness without that cry of
   "forsaken"? I ask these questions not because I can answer them, but in
   order to awake a reverent wonder and a fruitful awe. This I know, that
   cheap forgiveness always lightens sin. Flippant forgiveness gilds the
   sin it forgives, and the sorest injury we can do to any man is to
   lighten his conception of the enormity of sin. The only really healthy
   forgiveness is the forgiveness which pardons sin while at the same time
   it reveals it. This, at any rate, is one of the commanding glories of
   evangelical religion--it never makes light of sin. Nowhere does
   forgiveness shine more resplendently, and nowhere does sin gloom more
   repulsively, than in the redemptive love of Christ. In that love we
   behold both the horrors of the midnight and the quiet, sunny glories of
   the noontide. "Christ suffered for sins once," in order that sin might
   never be glozed and veneered. In obtaining our forgiveness by His
   death, the Lord Christ revealed His love and unveiled our sin.

   "Christ suffered for sins . . . that He might bring us to God." [Verse
   18] By the power of His redemption we can make our way home. He is "the
   way"; the road has been opened for us by the ministry of His grace. He
   is the "truth"; in His redemption truth was not dimmed but glorified.
   He is "the life"; in His grace are to be found all the resources for
   raising the dead into the renewed and glorified estate of children of
   God. He suffered, "that He might bring us to God." All that need be
   said about that gracious "bringing" is just this, that in Jesus,
   answering the call of His redeeming grace, men and women in countless
   numbers have turned their faces home, and are making their way out of
   the deadening bondage of sin into the "glorious liberty of the children
   of God."


   Far, far away, like bells at evening pealing,

   The voice of Jesus sounds o'er land and sea;

   And laden souls, by thousands meekly stealing,

   Kind Shepherd, turn their weary steps to Thee.

   And now the sphere of our vision is changed. Our minds are turned to
   another aspect of the saving ministry of Christ. The Saviour has died.
   "The great transaction's done." He has suffered for sins "once."
   Forgiveness is offered to all. What of those who have departed this
   life, and have never heard the news of the great redemption? Men have
   sinned against their light, they have revolted against the Master. But
   they have lacked the unspeakable advantage of hearing the story of
   redemptive love. Are they to have no chance? The souls "which aforetime
   were disobedient . . . in the days of Noah," [Verse 20] are they to
   suffer for their disobedience, deprived al together of the ministry of
   Christ's redemption? Let the question be stated with perfect
   frankness--are the sinful, who have never heard of Jesus, to pass into
   the darkness of a final destiny, a darkness which will never be
   illumined by the gospel and ministry of redemption? Here is the
   scriptural answer to that painful quest: "He went and preached unto the
   spirits in prison." [Verse 19] I know we are dealing with dim hints,
   and not with bright revelations, but from those words one thing is
   clear to me, that final judgment is not to be pronounced on any until
   they have heard of the redemptive love of Jesus, and have had the offer
   and opportunity of accepting it. No man's destiny is to be fixed until
   he has heard of Christ. The "spirits in prison," who have not heard the
   gospel of redemption, are to hear it in their prison-house and are to
   have the gracious offer which is made to you and me to-day. I know the
   objection which is taken to this interpretation. It is said to weaken
   the urgency of foreign missions, to make men sluggish in the labour of
   taking the gospel of light to unillumined tribes and peoples. If the
   offer of salvation is to be made to the ignorant on the other side of
   death, what special urgency is there for strenuous labour in the
   present? That is how many men have reasoned, and how many reason
   to-day. If the unenlightened heathen are not swept into hell, the
   burden of the situation is lightened, and the strain is relaxed. It is
   a terrific motive to conceive that the unillumined multitudes are
   dropping over the precipice of death into ever lasting torment. And
   that has been the conception of many devoted followers of Christ. I was
   reading a book the other day in which the writer made the terrible
   declaration that three millions of the heathen and Mohammedans are
   dying every month, dropping over the precipice into the awful night,
   swept into eternity! Swept into what? If they go out with unlit minds
   and hearts, are they never to see the gracious countenance of the Light
   of Life? "He went and preached unto the spirits in prison." Again I
   ask, does this destroy the urgency of foreign missions, and will it
   lull the heart of the Church to sleep? Where are we if the motive of
   our missions and ministry is to save people from the fires of hell?
   Apart altogether from salvation from torment, is the Master Himself
   worth knowing? Sup posing we could now be assured that every soul in
   the heathen world would be here after rescued from the torments of
   hell, is there nothing in our Gospel which shapes itself into an urgent
   and all-constraining evangel? Seek out some ripe old saint, who has
   deep and intimate intercourse with the Lord; let her open her heart to
   you about the glories of her faith; and you will discover that the word
   "hell" has dropped out of her vocabulary. She is so absorbed in the
   glories of her Lord, so possessed by the delights of daily
   companionship, so engaged in carrying her own God-given comfort to the
   sorrows of others, that the house of torments has no place in her
   heart. If you ask her the nature of the evangel she carries about with
   her, this will be her reply:


   God only knows the love of God,

   Oh that it now were shed abroad

   In every human heart!

   The real missionary motive is not to save from hell, but to reveal the
   Christ; not to save from a peril, but to proclaim and create a glorious
   companionship. Here is the marrow of the controversy, concentrated into
   one pressing question: Is it of infinite moment to know Christ now?
   Assume that there are now men and women in the heathen world who are to
   remain upon the earth for the next twenty years, and it is in our power
   to make those twenty years a season of hallowed fellowship with the
   Lord, is it worth the doing? Even further assuming that if they pass
   through death unenlightened, they will hear the message of
   reconciliation in the beyond, is it worth our while to light up those
   twenty years with the gracious light of redemptive grace? What is the
   money-value of an hour with the Lord? I do not address my question to
   the unredeemed, for the unredeemed have no answer, and in them the
   missionary-motive has no place. I speak to those who have accepted the
   offer of reconciling love, and who know the power of the Lord's
   salvation, and of them I ask--What is the money-value of an hour with
   the Lord? "Beyond all knowledge and all thought." Carry your values
   across to the regions of ignorance and night. To be able to give one
   "day of the Son of Man" to some poor old soul in heathendom: to lighten
   one day's load; to transfigure one day's sorrow; to lift the burden of
   his passion; to create a river of kindliness; to light his lamp in the
   evening-time, and to send him through the shadows in the assurance of
   immortal hope,--is it worth the doing? "A day in Thy courts is better
   than a thousand." Such is the value of a day with the Lord. "We are
   stewards of the mysteries of grace. Because we have them we owe them.
   Woe be to us if through our thoughtlessness we leave our fellowmen in
   days of burdensome terror and night, when by our ministry we might have
   led them into the peace and liberty of the children of light.

   And now the sphere of the Lord's activity is again changed. The apostle
   next turns our minds to the Lord's enthronement and dominion. He "is on
   the right hand of God, having gone Verse into heaven; angels and
   authorities and powers being made subject unto Him." [Verse 22] I need
   that conception of the Christ! I know Him as a Sufferer, despised and
   lonely, sharing our frailties, and hastening on to death. I know Him as
   "a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief." I need to know Him as the
   risen and glorified King, moving in supreme exaltations, receiving the
   glad and reverent homage of "the spirits that surround the throne." I
   have seen Him weep; I have seen Him wearied at the well; I have heard
   Him cry "I thirst"; I have heard the still more awful cry "Forsaken!"
   Now I would see Him, "with a name above every name," "highly exalted,"
   "angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto Him." We are
   timid, and nerveless, and hope less, lacking in spiritual energy and
   persistence, crawling in reluctance when we ought to speed like
   conquerors, and all because we do not realise the majestic lordship of
   our King. "All power is given unto Me in heaven and on earth." What
   kind of followers ought that to create? Surely it ought to be creative
   of disciples who can "strongly live and nobly strive." Soldiers will
   dare anything when they have confidence in the strength and wisdom of
   their general. His commands are their possibilities, and they are eager
   to turn them into sure achievements. We have a brave Captain, seated
   upon the throne, and exercising universal sovereignty. Surely we ought
   to march in the spirit of assured conquest. We ought to attack every
   stronghold of sin with confidence, as though the dark citadel were
   already falling into ruin. The Lord wishes His disciples to begin all
   enterprises in the knowledge that victory is secured. "Believe that ye
   receive them and ye shall have them." That is the spirit of victory.

   All this redemptive power may become ours by baptism, but not the
   baptism that consists in any outward sprinkling of external cleansing.
   "Not by the putting away of the filth of the flesh." We need to be
   lifted above the filth of the spirit, and so the baptism must be an
   inspiration. There must be poured into our life rivers of energy from
   the risen Lord.

   That cleansing flood will create within us moral soundness. We shall
   attain unto "a good conscience." Our lives will be set in
   "interrogation toward God." Our souls will be possessed by a reverent
   inquisitiveness, and they will be ever searching among the deep things
   of God.

THE SUFFERING WHICH MEANS TRIUMPH

  1 Peter iv. 1-6

   Forasmuch then as Christ suffered in the flesh, arm ye yourselves also
   with the same mind; for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased
   from sin; that ye no longer should live the rest of your time in the
   flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. For the time past
   may suffice to have wrought the desire of the Gentiles, and to have
   walked in lasciviousness, lusts, winebibbings, revellings, carousings,
   and abominable idolatries: wherein they think it strange that ye run
   not with them into the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you: who
   shall give account to Him that is ready to fudge the quick and the
   dead. For unto this end was the gospel preached even to the dead, that
   they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according
   to God in the spirit.

   "Forasmuch then as Christ suffered in the flesh." [Verse 1] Do not let
   us so think of the sufferings of Christ as to relegate them to the last
   few days of His earthly ministry. It is well to confine the great term,
   "the passion," to the awful events of Gethsemane and Calvary. In the
   midnight of the latter days the happenings are unspeakable. On Calvary
   the sufferings not only culminate; they become unique. They detach
   themselves from the common lot, and pass into the pangs of a lonely and
   terrible isolation whose supreme bitterness cannot be shared.


   We may not know, we cannot tell

   What pains He had to bear.

   It is well to mark these appalling hours by the distinctive term, "the
   passion." But we must not allow "the passion" to eclipse the sufferings
   of the earlier days. Christ always "suffered in the flesh." The streak
   of blood lay like a red track across the years. The marks of sacrifice
   were everywhere pronounced. What occasioned the common sufferings? Here
   is the explanation. His life was dominated by a supreme thought; it was
   controlled by an all-commanding purpose. What was the purpose? What was
   the prevailing characteristic of His mind? "I do always those things
   that please Him." He has translated that purpose of obedience into
   counsel for His disciples: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His
   righteousness." That was the mind of the Master. He made his abode in
   the unseen. He sought His gratifications in the eternal. He rejected
   the sovereignty of the flesh. He subordinated the temporal. He
   uncrowned the body, making it a common subject, and compelling it into
   obeisance to high commands. In all the competing alternatives that
   presented themselves, priority was given to the spiritual. The
   allurements of ease, the piquant flavours of pleasurable sensations,
   the feverish delights of passion, the delicious thrill of popular
   acclamation, the sweetness of immediate triumph: all these many and
   varied offspring of the temporal were not permitted to be regnant; they
   were not allowed to usurp the place of executive and determining
   forces; they were muzzled and restrained, and kept to the rear of the
   life. Christ looked "not at the things which are seen, but at the
   things which are not seen." Such was the mind of the Master.

   Now, emphasis of this kind inevitably necessitates suffering. No man
   can give pre-eminence to the unseen without the shedding of blood. When
   the immediate contends with the apparently remote, the immediate is so
   urgently obtrusive that to hold it down entails a crucifixion. When
   carnality contends with conscience, the healthy settling of the
   contention necessitates suffering. When ease opposes duty, the putting
   down of the fascinating enemy necessitates suffering. When mere
   sharpness comes into conflict with truth, when money seeks to usurp the
   throne of righteousness, when the glitter of immediate success ranges
   itself against the fixed and glorious constellation of holiness, the
   controversies will not be settled in bloodless reveries and in
   unexhausting dreams. To put down the immediate and to prefer the
   remote, to subject the temporal and to choose the eternal, demands a
   continual crucifixion. Christ also suffered, being tempted!
   Alternatives were presented to Him, and the preference occasioned the
   shedding of blood. Christ suffered, being tempted! The temptations were
   not bloodless probings of the invulnerable air. They were searching
   appeals to vital susceptibilities, and resistance was pain. "Christ
   also suffered in the flesh." All through the years He had been
   exercising the higher choice. Before He emerged into the public gaze,
   in the obscure years at Nazareth, in His early youth in the village, in
   the social life of the community, in the little affairs of the
   carpenter's shop, He had been denying Himself and taking up His cross.
   He had preferred the eternal to the temporal, and His clear, commanding
   conscience had dominated the clamours of the flesh. This was the
   emphasis of the Master's life; He "suffered in the flesh." Now such
   emphasis spells sinlessness. When the eternal rules the temporal, when
   the remotely glorious is preferred before the immediately bewitching,
   when suffering is chosen before the violation of the moral and
   spiritual ideal, the soul is already wearing the crown of the sinless
   life.

   "He that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin." [Verse 1]
   And now the apostle takes up the example of the Master and makes it a
   motive in the life of the disciple. "Forasmuch then as Christ suffered
   in the flesh, arm ye yourselves also with the same mind." What was His
   mind? The preference and the predominance of the eternal. "Arm
   yourselves with the same mind." Let the same governing purpose
   determine the choices in your life. In every moment of the little day
   let the eternal rule. "No longer live the rest of your time in the
   flesh." [Verse 2] Don't let the flesh constitute the entire circle of
   your movement! Don't let the temporal define the boundaries of your
   journeyings! Launch out upon larger waters! Live no longer "to the
   lusts of men." Don't follow the feverish will-o'-the-wisps that flit
   about the swamps! But live "to the will of God." Follow the eternal
   star! Let the spiritual control all the events in your life, both great
   and small, just as the force of gravitation dominates alike the
   swinging planet and the mote that sports in the sunbeam. Such a
   sovereign purpose will necessitate suffering, but the purpose will of
   itself provide the necessary defence. "Arm ye yourselves also with the
   same mind." [Verse 1] The exalted purpose will be our armour, our
   assurance against destruction. If we are wounded, in the wounds there
   shall be no poison. If we suffer, in the sufferings there shall be no
   disease. In the combat there shall be no fatality. We are "armed"
   against destructive hurt. "What shall harm us if we be followers of
   that which is good?" "As dying, yet shall we live." "Our light
   affliction . . . worketh for us a weight of glory." "Forasmuch then as
   Christ suffered in the flesh, arm ye yourselves also with the same
   mind."

   From the contemplation of the Master's "sufferings in the flesh" the
   apostle now turns the minds of his readers to the contemplation of
   their own yesterdays, if perchance they may find in the retrospect an
   added force to constrain them to a life of triumphant suffering. He has
   sought to allure them to exalted, spiritual living by the example of
   the Lord; now he will seek to drive them into the same lofty tendency
   by causing them to dwell upon their own loathsome and appalling past.
   The repulsion obtained from our yesterdays will give impetus to the
   inclination to live "to the will of God" to-day. "For the time past may
   suffice to have wrought the desire of the Gentiles, and to have walked
   in lasciviousness, lusts, winebibbings, revellings, carousings, and
   abominable idolatries." [Verse 3] What an appalling list! And how
   plainly worded! Surely a list like that will add the force of recoil to
   the newly-born inclination towards God! It is a fruitful exercise to go
   into our yesterdays, and quietly meditate upon "our times past." It is
   a humbling and painful ministry to trace the face of the past, bit by
   bit, feature by feature, giving to each characteristic its own plain
   and legitimate name. The Apostle Paul frequently employed this ministry
   when writing to his converts. He would never allow them to forget their
   yesterdays, lest they should lose the impetus that comes from the
   retrospect. "And such were some of you." There you have a retrospective
   glance. What had they been? "Fornicators, adulterers, effeminate,
   thieves, covetous, drunkards, revilers, extortioners." How black the
   catalogue!" And such were some of you." I think the reminder would send
   the converts to their knees in intenser supplication. Hear the apostle
   again in his letter to the Ephesians: "In time past ye walked according
   to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of
   the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience."
   I say he will not suffer the past to be eclipsed and forgotten. He
   lifts the veil, and pointedly describes the terrible scene. And here is
   the Apostle Peter seeking to confirm his readers devotion by the power
   of a repulsion, and he turns their minds to "the times past." It is a
   rare ministry for the creation of sincere and agonising prayer! A man
   may pray, "Lead, kindly Light," and in in the utterance there may be
   "no agony and bloody sweat." If he turn his face to the past, the
   burden of his yesterdays may crush out of his heart a prayer which is
   more a moaning cry than an articulate speech.


   I was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou

   Shouldst lead me on.

   I loved to choose and see my path, but now

   Lead Thou me on!

   I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears

   Pride ruled my will: remember not past years.

   That last prayer is just the cry of an aching and broken heart! The
   retrospect made him a humble and wrestling suppliant. That is the
   motive of the apostle in reminding his readers of "the times past" in
   their lives. He longed to corroborate their new-born spirituality by
   the rebound acquired from the contemplation of their own past. "I
   thought over my ways, and turned my feet unto Thy testimonies."

   Now, let us assume that a man has become "armed with the mind" of
   Christ, that his own wasted past gives impetus to his renewed present,
   that he will pay homage to the eternal even at the cost of immediate
   suffering what will be the influence of such a life upon the world?
   Assume that the "unseen and eternal" receives the emphasis, that the
   temporal is denied at all costs if it conflict with the eternal, how
   will such a life of mingled restraint and loftiness affect the world?
   Here is the answer. "They think it strange that ye run not with them
   into the same excess of riot." [Verse 4] "They think it strange!" They
   are arrested in wonder! What is the significance of this? That we shall
   startle the world by our Puritanism. We "run not with them into the
   same excess of riot." They are astounded! Puritanism is arresting. Do
   not let us be ashamed of the old word. Puritanism is most vigorously
   denounced where it is least under stood. We need to get back the
   commanding characteristics of its life. We need to recover its broad
   principles, but not its particular and detailed application. I speak
   not now of the counterfeit Puritanism which expressed itself in loud
   and eccentric externalisms, and in much-flaunted and self-advertised
   piety and self-denial. There is the Puritan described by Lord Macaulay,
   who was distinguished from other men by "his gait, his garb, his lank
   hair, the sour solemnity of his face, the upturned white of his eyes,
   his nasal twang, and his peculiar dialect." That is a Puritanism for
   which no sane and healthy man desires a resurrection. But there is the
   Puritanism which Longfellow portrays in Miles Standish; there is the
   Puritanism of John Milton, in whose poetry we touch the very heart and
   spirit of the great awakening. "What, then, is the characteristic ideal
   of true Puritanism? It is life whose secret springs are governed by the
   eternal. It is choice of duty before ease, of ideas before sensations,
   of truth before popularity, of a good conscience before a full purse,
   of the holy God before dazzling and bewitching Mammon! That is the true
   Puritanism, and that is the life whose glorious passion arrests the un
   restrained and riotous world in sharp and inquisitive wonder. "They
   think it strange that ye run not with them into the same excess of
   riot." That sense of wonder may ripen into reverence and may issue in
   prayer. The contemplation of a fine restraint and an unspotted
   integrity has often created an uneasiness which has eventually led its
   victim into the very rest and peace of God. But the world's wonder does
   not always mature into reverence. Some times it sours into resentment,
   and results in a malignity which demands the Puritan's crucifixion. I
   cannot forget that the men of old wondered at the Master, and then
   proceeded to His crucifixion. "They think it strange . . . speaking
   evil of you." [Verse 4] They will attribute your restraint to evil
   motives. The hiding of your benevolence will be interpreted as
   stinginess; its expression will be regarded as self-advertisement. Your
   self-denial will be explained as a cloak that conceals a deeper
   covetousness; your entire walk will be denounced as inspired by
   Beelzebub, the prince of the devils. In the face of such resentment and
   reviling what shall the Puritan do? What says the apostle? Just go on!
   In the face of it all, just calmly persist. Do not return reviling for
   reviling. Leave them and yourselves to the arbitrament of God. He knows
   all! We must all "give account to Him that is ready to judge the quick
   and the dead." Maintain the emphasis! Proclaim and exalt the Eternal!
   Live "not to the lusts of the flesh," but "to the will of God." The
   path of suffering is "the way to glory." And "wisdom shall be justified
   of her children."

GETTING READY FOR THE END

  1 Peter iv. 7-11

   The end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore of sound mind, and be
   sober unto prayer: above all things being fervent in your love among
   yourselves; for love covereth a multitude of sins: using hospitality
   one to another without murmuring: according as each hath received a
   gift, ministering it among yourselves, as good stewards of the manifold
   grace of God; if any man speaketh, speaking as it were oracles of God;
   if any man ministereth, ministering as of the strength which God
   supplieth: that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus
   Christ, whose is the glory and the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

   THAT is a most momentous conviction which is expressed in these words:
   "The end of all things is at hand." [Verse 7] What kind of conduct will
   it determine, and to what kind of counsel will it lead? Here is an
   apostle, deeply possessed by the solemn conviction that the great
   Consummation is approaching, that the glorified Christ is returning,
   that the judgment is impending, and that the "end of all things is at
   hand." In the looming presence of so urgent and so commanding an event,
   how will the apostle shape his message? What kind of counsel will he
   give to his readers? What manner of preparation will he constrain them
   to make? It matters little or nothing to my purpose that the apostle's
   anticipations of the second advent were premature, and that the
   stupendous consummation was delayed. For you and for me the instructive
   and all-absorbing conjunction remains the same. Here is the Apostle
   Peter sharing with his fellow-Christians the expectation of an
   immediate end. The Judge is at the door! What will be the manner of
   their behaviour? If we knew that within a year or two the Master will
   reappear as the august and, sovereign Judge, how ought we to pass the
   intervening days? We know, from the letters of the Apostle Paul, how
   the urgent expectancy influenced many of the early Christians. Some
   were thrown into panic. Others were despoiled of their spiritual
   collectedness by the invasion of unreasonable excitement. Others
   abandoned their ordinary employment, and lapsed into an indolence in
   which they might find more leisure to wait and watch for the King's
   appearing. And we know with what severity the apostle denounced these
   perilous and irrational excesses. "Study to be quiet and to do your own
   business." "Be not shaken in mind." "We command that with quietness ye
   work and eat your own bread." "Let us watch and be sober." All this
   dangerous sensationalism was combatted and subdued by the cool
   self-possession of this man's healthy and imperial mind.

   And now here is the Apostle Peter confronted by the same prevailing and
   insidious inclinations. What will be the character of his message? Let
   us make the matter directly pertinent to our own condition that we may
   appreciate the strong, cooling, controlling influence of the apostle's
   counsel. For us, too, "the end" may be at hand. Death looms on the
   not-distant horizon. The King is at the gate! What shall be the nature
   of our preparations, and the character of our behaviour? "The end of
   all things is at hand: be ye therefore of sound mind," [Verse 7] Sound
   mind! Life is to be characterised by reasonableness and sanity. There
   is to be nothing morbid about our mental state, nothing melancholy or
   diseased. We are to be mentally "sound," emancipated from distraction
   and panic. We may enter into the content of the descriptive word by
   watching its usage in our common speech. We are familiar with the
   phrase "as sound as a bell," and the usage will act as part-interpreter
   of the apostle's thought. "Sound as a bell!" There is no break in the
   metal, no severance in the elements; it holds together in compact and
   undivided unity. "Sound mind"; as sound as a bell; no break in the
   mind, no division, no distraction, but a wonderful collectedness,
   issuing in the definite tone of clear and decisive purpose. "We are
   also familiar with another application of the word, as in the usage,
   "sound" and "unsound" meat, where the significance is indicative of
   health and disease. And this, too, may guide us into the content of the
   apostle's thought, for when he counsels "sound-mindedness" he
   unquestionably refers to a mental condition which is freed from all
   morbidity, defilement, taint, and disease. "The end of all things is at
   hand: be ye therefore of sound mind," delivered on the one hand from
   the mental distraction that destroys life's music, and on the other
   hand from the morbid depression which so frequently opens the gate for
   the invasion of death. "And be sober" [Verse 7] That is the second note
   of the apostle's counsel. "And be sober." It is a warning against all
   kinds of intoxication, but especially against the intoxication of
   excited and tumultuous emotion. There are stimulants other than those
   of intoxicating drinks; and there is a sensationalism to be found
   elsewhere than in carnal gratification. Excessive stimulants may be
   found in the revival meeting, and men may revel in intoxicated
   emotionalism even in the sanctuary. Men may "lose their heads "in many
   more ways than by the excessive imbibing of strong drink. "Be sober."
   Don't give way to any excitement which will make life grotesque and
   foolish! Beware of the sensationalism which is often the minister of
   sin. "Be sober." It is an appeal for the culture and discipline of
   emotion. "Be sober unto prayer"; [Verse 7] preserve that calmness of
   life which is consistent with steady aspiration and fruitful
   supplication; maintain a quiet "watching unto prayer." Here, then, are
   two of the features which characterised a life possessed by a healthy
   expectancy of the Lord's appearing: soundmindedness and sobriety. "We
   are to wait the coming of the King with mind and heart delivered from
   the distractions of panic, from the taint of corruption, and from a
   feverish sensationalism which is destructive of the higher ministries
   of fellowship and prayer.

   And now the apostle proceeds to add a third element to those already
   mentioned. "Above all things being fervent in your love among
   yourselves." [Verse 8] To "sound-mindedness "and "sobriety" he adds the
   ministry of "love." Now the apostle is at some pains to make it clear
   to us what is the quality of this love which should characterise the
   life which expects the King's appearing. In the first place, it is to
   be "fervent." Now the significance of our English word "fervour"
   scarcely unveils to us the contents of the apostle's mind. He did not
   so much suggest a love that is ardent as a love that is tense. This
   very word "tense" is almost the original word. The love has to be
   "tense," stretched out, extended to the utmost limit of a grand
   comprehensiveness. The New Testament recognises different types and
   qualities of love, and there is no counsel in which it is more
   abounding than just in this counsel to push back the boundaries of a
   circumscribed affection so that it be characterised by a more spacious
   inclusiveness. There is love whose measure is that of an umbrella.
   There is love whose inclusiveness is that of a great marquee. And there
   is love whose comprehension is that of the immeasurable sky. The aim of
   the New Testament is the conversion of the umbrella into a tent, and
   the merging of the tent into the glorious canopy of the all-enfolding
   heavens. Therefore does the writer of this very letter, in a second
   letter which he has written, give this very suggestive counsel, "add to
   brotherly love, love." Which just means this: make your love more
   tense; push back the walls of family love until they include the
   neighbour; again push back the walls until they include the stranger;
   again push back the walls until they comprehend the foe. The quality of
   our love is determined by its inclusiveness. At the one extreme there
   is self-love; at the other extreme there is philanthropy! What is the
   "tense," the stretch of my love? What is its covering power? I do not
   wonder that the apostle proceeds to indicate the magnificent "cover
   "afforded by a magnificent love. "Love covereth a multitude of sins."
   [Verse 8] Not the sins of the lover, but the sins of the loved! Love is
   willing to forget as well as to forgive! Love does not keep hinting at
   past failures and past revolts. Love is willing to hide them in a
   nameless grave. When a man, whose life has been stained and blackened
   by "a multitude of sins," turns over a new leaf, love will never hint
   at the old leaf, but will rather seek to cover it in deep and healing
   oblivion. Love is so busy unveiling the promises and allurements of the
   morrow, that she has little time, and still less desire to stir up the
   choking dust on the blasted and desolate fields of yesterday. "Then
   drew near unto Him all the publicans and sinners." There's a "cover"
   for you! "And behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she
   knew . . . stood at His feet behind Him weeping!" There's a cover for
   you! "The Son of Man is come to seek that which is lost." There's a
   cover for you! I do not wonder that the great evangelical prophet of
   the Old Testament, in heralding the advent of the Saviour, should
   proclaim Him as "a hiding-place from the wind, a covert from the
   tempest, as rivers of water in a dry place, and as the shadow of a
   great rock in a weary land." "Love covereth all things."

   But we have not yet done with the apostle's characterisation of the
   qualities of love. He adds a third word which confirms and enriches the
   other two. True love, "stretched-out" love, all-sheltering love, "uses
   hospitality without murmuring." [Verse 9] True love is a splendid host,
   a veritable Gaius in the lavish entertainment which it offers to weary
   and footsore pilgrims. In the primitive Christian day, the apostolic
   days, love opened the door and gave hospitality to the itinerant
   preachers as they went from place to place proclaiming the message of
   the Cross. Love opened the door to the persecuted refugees, driven from
   their homesteads because of their devotion to the Lord. There were many
   of them about, and the love-children were to keep an open door and a
   sharp look-out, and offer the welcome entertainment. Love is the very
   genius of hospitality; it opens the "hospice" in the stormy and
   perilous heights, and provides a travellers rest. Wherever love is, the
   hospice may be found! "Love never faileth." And the gracious ministry
   is all discharged so graciously; "without murmuring!" There is no frown
   upon the face, no sense of "put-outness" in the attention. It is all
   done, as Matthew Henry says, "in a kind, easy, hand some manner," as
   though the host had been almost impatiently waiting for the privilege,
   and yearning for its speedy approach.

   Now, brethren, the King is at the gate! Soon His hand will be upon the
   latch! How shall we prepare for Him? In sound-mindedness, in spiritual
   sobriety, and in a love which is ever straining after more and more
   spacious breadth of gracious and generous hospitality. How shall these
   dispositions express themselves? What shall be the medium of affection?
   What shall be the line of our ministry? The apostle provides the
   answer: "According as each hath received a gift." [Verse 10] We must
   work through what we have received. "What hast thou that thou hast not
   received?" Our members, our senses, our mental aptitudes, our spiritual
   endowments! They are all the gifts of the King! We must use them all in
   the ministry of love. But beyond all these there is the mysterious and
   indescribable gift of our own individuality. We are each as unique in
   personality as we are each distinctive in face. Individuality is a
   unique gift, and is divinely purposed for unique service. We must
   reverently consecrate our individuality to the King's use, that it may
   become the minister of His own "manifold grace" [Verses 10, 11] and
   "strength" In this subordination the individuality is preserved intact
   and unimpaired. Working through us, the Holy Ghost will, shall I say,
   impinge upon the world in a somewhat different form than from the life
   of any of our fellows. If an electric current be led through a series
   of several different materials, its appearance in the outer world will
   vary with each wire. "In a platinum wire it may appear as light, in an
   iron one as heat, round a bar of soft iron as magnetic energy, led into
   a solution as a power that decomposes and recombines." So in many
   individualities are there "diversities of operations, but the one
   Spirit." What we have to do is to take our individuality, "according as
   each hath received the gift," and so reverently consecrate it that "the
   manifold grace" may work a unique ministry, and by "the strength which
   God supplieth" we may manifest a daily salvation which shall be to the
   glory of God.

   Here then, I conclude. I think that no one can be made to stumble by
   any narrowness and irrelevancy in the apostle's counsel. His
   commandment is exceeding broad. How shall we prepare for the coming of
   the King? What can be more reasonable than the response I have
   attempted to expound? In sound-mindedness, in spiritual sobriety, in an
   affection which is ever seeking greater inclusiveness, and working
   through the distinctive gifts of the consecrated individual life. I
   tell you, if this be my condition, I shall not be afraid "at His
   coming." He may come in a moment, and very suddenly, in the noontide,
   or the midnight, or at the cock-crow; come when He may, I shall "love
   His appearing." Living calmly, in the atmosphere of affection, and in
   the mystic strength of consecration, I shall know Him as my friend. The
   present Bishop of Durham has told us of a beloved friend of his who
   narrated to him a strangely vivid dream which he had long, long years
   ago. Let me tell it in the Bishop's words. "Through the bed-chamber
   window seemed to shine on a sudden an indescribable light; the dreamer
   seemed to run, to look; and there, in the depths above, were beheld
   three forms. One was unknown, one the Archangel, One the Lord Jesus
   Christ. And at this most sudden sight that soul, the soul of one over
   whom, to my knowledge, the unutterable solemnities of the unseen are
   wont to brood with almost painful power, was instantaneously thrilled
   with a rapturous joy . . . unspeakable and full of glory: My Saviour,
   my Saviour!'"

   I pray that when that light breaks upon us, not in the ministry of a
   dream, but in the veritable coming of the Lord; when for you and for me
   "the end of all things is at hand," may we have so brooded on "the
   solemnities," and so laboured in the gracious ministry of affection,
   that we too, "when He cometh," shall be "instantaneously thrilled with
   raptuous joy, unspeakable and full of glory: My Saviour, my Saviour!'"

THE FIERY TRIAL,

  1 Peter iv. 12-19

   Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial among you,
   which cometh upon you to prove you, as though a strange thing happened
   unto you: but insomuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings,
   rejoice; that at the revelation of His glory also ye may rejoice with
   exceeding joy. If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are
   ye; because the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God resteth upon you.
   For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief , or an evil-doer,
   or as a meddler in other men's matters: but if a man suffer as a
   Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this
   name. For the time is come for judgement to begin at the house of God:
   and if it begin first at us, what shall be the end of them that obey
   not the gospel of God? And if the righteous is scarcely saved, where
   shall the ungodly and sinner appear? Wherefore let them also that
   suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing
   unto a faithful Creator.

   "The fiery trial among you, which cometh upon you to prove you." [Verse
   12] But is it not one of the perquisites of sainthood to be delivered
   from suffering? One would have anticipated that part of the inheritance
   of grace would be freedom from the fiery trial. The flames would never
   reach us. The enemy would be stayed, and we should sit down in happy
   quietness at the King's feast! But this is not the programme of
   Christianity. Christianity is almost alarmingly daring in the obtrusive
   emphasis which it gives to the darker elements in its programme. There
   is no attempt to hide or obscure them. No effort is made to engage our
   attention to the "green pastures" and "still waters," and to distract
   us from the affrighting valley of shadow and gloom. "Whom the Lord
   loveth He chasteneth." "In the world ye shall have tribulation."
   "Perfected through sufferings." "Let him take up his cross daily and
   follow me." "The fiery trial which is to try you." These are not words
   which are addressed to "murderers" or "thieves," or "evil-doers," or
   "busybodies"; they are quietly spoken to the saints, to men and women
   whose lives are pledged to virtue, and who are aspiring after the
   holiness of the perfected life in Christ.

   Then let us just note this: our sufferings do not prove our religion
   counterfeit. Our many temptations do not throw suspicion on our
   sonship. Our trials are not the marks of our alienation. Do not let us
   think that we are strangers because our robes are sometimes stained
   with our blood. "Think it not strange," says this much-schooled
   apostle, "Think it not strange!" Don't think you have never been
   naturalised--super-naturalised--that you are still a foreigner, an
   outcast from the home of redemptive grace! These are the happenings of
   the home-country! They are not the marks of foreign rule. They are the
   signs of paternal government. You are in your Father's house! God will
   convert the apparent antagonism into a minister of heavenly grace. The
   oppressive harrow, as well as the genial sunshine, is part of the
   equipment needed for the maturing and perfecting of the fruits of the
   earth.

   "What, then, is the purpose of "the fiery trial"? What is the meaning
   of this permitted ministry of suffering? Well, in the first place, it
   tests character. It discharges the purpose of an examination. An
   examination, rightly regarded, is a vital part of our schooling. It is
   a minister of revelation. It unfolds our strengths and our weaknesses.
   And so it is in the larger examination afforded by the discipline of
   life. Our crises are productive of self-disclosures. They reveal us to
   ourselves, and I think the revelations are usually creative of grateful
   surprise. In the midst of the fiery trial we are filled with amazement
   at the fulness and strength of our resources. When the trial is looming
   we shrink from it in fear. "We say one to another, "I don't know how I
   shall bear it!" And then the crisis comes, and in the midst of the fire
   we are calm and strong; and when it is past, how frequently we are
   heard to say, "I never thought I could have gone through it!" And so
   "probation worketh hope"; the heavy discipline is creative of
   assurance; the terror becomes the nutriment of our confidence.

   But the fiery trial not only tests by revealing character, it also
   strengthens and confirms it. Hard trial makes hard and much-enduring
   muscle. The water that is too soft makes flabby limbs; it is not
   creative of bone. And circum stances which are too soft make no bone:
   they are productive of character without backbone. Luxuriousness is
   rarely the cradle of giants. It is not unsuggestive that the soft and
   bountiful tropics are not the home of the strong, indomitable, and
   progressive peoples. The pioneering and progressive races have dwelt in
   sterner and harder climes. The lap of luxury does not afford the
   elementary iron for the upbringing of strong and enduring life.
   Hardness hardens; antagonism solidifies; trials inure and confirm. How
   commonly it has happened that men who, in soft circumstances, have been
   weak and irresolute, were hardened into fruitful decision by the
   ministry of antagonism and pain. "Thou art Simon"--a hearer, a man of
   loose hearsays and happenings; "Thou shalt be called Peter"--a rock, a
   man of hard, compact, and resolute convictions. But "Simon" became
   "Peter" through the ministry of the fiery trial. The man of "soft
   clothing" is in the luxury of kings houses; the hard man with the
   camels hair and the leathern girdle is away out in the hardships of the
   desert. "We must through much tribulation enter into the Kingdom of
   God."

   But the fiery trial not only reveals and hardens the character, it also
   develops it by bringing out its hidden beauties. I am using the word
   develop as the photographer uses it. You know how he brings out the
   lines of his pictures. The picture is laid in the vessel, and the
   liquid is moved and moved across it; it passes over the face of the
   picture, and little by little the hidden graces are disclosed. "All Thy
   billows are gone over me." That is the Lord's developer; it brings out
   the soft lines in the character. Under its ministry we pass "from
   strength to strength, "from grace to grace," "from glory to glory."

   And so the fiery trial tests and confirms and develops the character. I
   do not wonder that with conceptions such as these, and with such
   outlooks, the apostle calls upon his Christian readers to lift up their
   heads, to walk not as children of shame, but as children of rejoicing.
   And look at the motives he adduces to create the spirit of rejoicing.
   "Look at your companionship," he seems to say. "Ye are partakers of
   Christ's sufferings." [Verse 13] In the furnace with you is "one like
   unto the Son of Man." We have scarcely touched the fringe of life if we
   have not discovered what that conviction means to men. "Yet I do
   persuade myself," says Samuel Rutherford to one of his correspondents,
   "ye know that the weightiest end of the cross of Christ that is laid
   upon you lieth upon your strong Saviour; for Isaiah saith, In all your
   afflictions he is afflicted.' O blessed Second, who suffereth with you!
   And glad may your soul be even to walk in the fiery furnace with one
   like unto the Son of Man, who is also the Son of God. Courage! Up with
   your heart! When ye do tire He will bear both you and your burden." And
   writing to Lady Forrest the same saintly writer gives this comfort: "I
   hear that Christ hath been so kind as to visit you with sickness. He
   would have more service of you. He is your loving husband, and would
   draw you into the bonds of a sweeter love." Look at your companionship!
   "Rejoice," inasmuch as the Lord is with you in unceasing fellowship.

   And look at the character of the Operator. "The Spirit of glory resteth
   upon you." [Verse 14] In the fiery trial the Operator is the
   Glory-spirit, the Maker of glory. As though He were controlling the
   hardships and trials and converting them into ministers of beauty and
   grace. The immeasurable waters of Niagara generate electrical power
   which a man may use to engrave a name upon a jewel; and the Spirit of
   Glory can so employ these waters of sorrow as to write our Father's
   name upon our foreheads. In some hands the trial would be an agent of
   indiscriminate destruction. In some hands the implements in a surgery
   would be implements of mutilation and murder; in the hands of a wise
   and confident surgeon they are the ministers of sanity and health. "The
   Spirit of Glory resteth upon you," and He has control of the
   implements! He sits by the fire. Look at the character of the Operator,
   and you will be filled with rejoicing.

   And look at the splendid issues of it all. "At the revelation of His
   glory ye may rejoice with exceeding joy." [Verse 13] Why this jubilant
   rejoicing? Because this shall be the ultimate issue: when the Lord is
   revealed in His glory it will be disclosed that we are sharers of the
   glory. The Spirit of Glory, which has rested upon us, will have wrought
   upon us, and brought us into the Master's likeness. We "shall be
   manifested with Him in glory."

   Well, now, if this be the ministry of trial, surely the fiery trial is
   a solemn necessity. Luxurious ease would destroy us. If the winds
   remained asleep we should remain weak and enervated. Life would drowse
   along in effeminate dreams. The glory of the perfected life would never
   be ours. And so life must have its crises. Judgments are necessities.
   Judgment must "begin at the House of God." Even the consecrated folk
   need the testing, the strengthening, the confirming discipline of
   suffering and pain. Even Paul must be thrown into the fiery furnace!
   Even John must feel the bite of the stinging flame! And if that be so
   with Paul and Peter and John, how much more for you and me! "If the
   righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner
   appear?" What a work is our salvation! These wills, these desires,
   these yearnings, these bodies!" What work God has with us, to lift us
   into His own glory!

TENDING THE FLOCK

  1 Peter v. 1-7

   The elders therefore among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a
   witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the
   glory that shall be revealed: Shepherd the flock of God which is among
   you, exercising the oversight, not of constraint, but willingly,
   according unto God; nor yet for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
   neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you, but making
   yourselves ensamples to the flock. And when the chief Shepherd shall be
   manifested, ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away.
   Likewise, ye younger, be subject unto the elder. Yea, all of you gird
   yourselves with humility, to serve one another: for God resisteth the
   proud, but giveth grace to the humble. Humble yourselves therefore
   under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time;
   casting all your anxiety upon Him, because He careth for you.

   "I exhort." [Verse 1] Let me fix your eyes upon the counsellor. There
   is an evangel in the speaker, altogether apart from the inspiration of
   his message. "We are contemplating Simon Peter in the ripe, assured
   strength of his evening-time. "I exhort." Shall we pause a moment that
   we may invite the ministry of reminiscence? By what chequered way has
   he reached this bourn of clear and quiet assurance? Let me recall some
   of the prominent landmarks. "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of
   men." . . . "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." . . .
   "Even if I must die with Thee, yet will I not deny Thee." . . . "Then
   began he to curse and swear, saying, I know not the man." . . . "Lord,
   Thou knowest all things; Thou knowest that I love Thee." . . . "Now
   when they saw the boldness of Peter, they marvelled." . . . "I, a
   fellow elder, a witness of the sufferings of Christ, a partaker of the
   glory that shall be revealed." It is a wonderful evolution! From the
   call of the spring-time to the ripe, confident testimony of the
   autumn-time! And between the two extremes what a medley of sharp and
   changeful experience! The rough, untutored, impulsive character-force
   has been washed and disciplined into discerning and fruitful strength.
   And now I picture Simon Peter as an old saint, bearing the marks of the
   stern fight; sealed with the brands of the Lord Jesus; his face lit up
   with the sober light of chastening memory and glorious hope. "I am a
   witness of the sufferings." Think of the content of the phrase when it
   falls from the lips of Simon Peter! How much he had seen which he now
   recalled in tears! "Could ye not watch with Me one hour?" He had seen
   that lonely and grief-filled Presence. "And the Lord turned and looked
   upon Peter." He had caught a glimpse of that betrayed face, and the
   features were burnt into his soul in lines of remorseful fire. "I am a
   witness of the sufferings." All the black and heart-rending events of
   Gethsemane and Calvary crowd the witnessing, for they were never absent
   for an hour from the Apostle's so penitent and regretful heart. But
   Calvary did not eclipse Olivet. The terrors of the Crucifixion were
   looked at in the soft light of the Resurrection dawn and in the
   startling wonders of the Ascension. And so yesterday became linked with
   the morrow. Memory was transfigured into hope. The witness became a
   herald. The denier became the heir. "I am a witness of the sufferings
   of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed."

   And now let us listen to the scarred old warrior's counsel. He is
   giving fatherly instruction to the officers of the Church. He is
   speaking to the elders, the overseers, the appointed leaders of these
   hallowed primitive assemblies. I wish to give the counsel the widest
   application, that it may include the outermost circle of Christian
   service. If we limited the counsel to bishops, then we should all
   listen to the tremendous charge as critical or unconcerned spectators.
   If we included all pastors and deacons, still the unconcerned majority
   might listen with perilous relish to the implied indictment. The
   counsel applies to every kind of Christian leadership. Wherever man or
   woman assumes the post of leader of souls, guide to the home of
   God--whether it be among children or adults, in visiting the hospitals
   or in going from house to house, in the pastorate or in the class, in
   the obscure mission or in the conspicuous phases of cathedral
   labours--the Apostle's counsel is pertinent, and unfolds the primary
   dispositions which are the secrets of prosperous service.

   Mark, then, the opening word of the counsel. "Shepherd the flock of God
   which is among you." [Verse 2] It is a very wealthy and suggestive word
   which forms the initial note of the Apostle's instructions. The
   Authorised Version translates it "feed," the Revised Version translates
   it "tend." Each element is significant of the shepherd, and both are
   essential to the full interpretation of the apostle's mind. It is a
   wonderful sphere of service which is disclosed to me. I am told that I
   can be the nourisher of my brother; I am told that I can also be his
   defence. I can "feed" him; I can stand between him and his hunger. I
   can tend him; I can stand between him and his perils. That is a
   beautiful ministry which God entrusts to me. I can get in among my
   brother's wants and take him bread. I can feed his faith, his hope, his
   love. I can lead him into "green pastures and by still waters," and
   discover to him the means of growth and refreshment. I can get in among
   my brother's perils and erect extra safeguards and defences. It is
   possible to love my way in between my brother and his appetites,
   between his spirit and his snares. That is our ministry, whatever be
   the precise character of the leadership we have assumed. It matters
   little or nothing whether we be called bishops, pastors, teachers,
   visitors; our mission is to feed and to fend, to take nourishing bread,
   and to offer protective shelter. If a man stand between his brother and
   spiritual necessity, or between his brother and spiritual peril, he is
   discharging the office of a day s-man, a mediator, a faithful
   under-shepherd, working loyally under the leadership of the "chief
   Bishop and Shepherd of our souls."

   How, then, is this ministry of feeder and fender to be successfully
   discharged? How is it to be saved from offence and impertinence? How
   shall we gain admission to move among the needs and perils of our
   brother's soul? How shall we gain an entrance into his secret place?
   "What dispositions are required in order to back the ministry and make
   it spiritually effective? The apostle acts as our counsellor, and gives
   us detailed instruction in all these things.

   First of all, it must be the service of willingness. "Not of
   constraint, but willingly." [Verse 2] One volunteer is worth two
   pressed men. I am not quite sure whether the proverbial saying is
   pertinent. I am doubtful if an equation can be established. On the high
   planes of spiritual service no number of pressed men can take the place
   of a volunteer. But can men be pressed into unfruitful spiritual
   service? Yes, men are sometimes constrained by what they call "the
   pressure of circumstances." They say that they "could not very well get
   out of it." They had been importuned so frequently that for very shame
   they could decline no longer. If they could have found another excuse,
   another excuse would have been offered. But their inventiveness failed
   them. Their excuse-chamber was empty. They simply had to do it! Their
   wills had no part in the hallowed service. They were just pressed into
   the ministry by circumstantial constraint which they could no longer
   comfortably resist. What shall we say about it? Just this--that people
   whose wills are not in the service, are really not in the service at
   all. Where there is no spontaneity the fervour is fictional, and we
   shall never thaw the wintry bondage of men by painted and theatrical
   fires.

   But there is a loftier constraint than the pressure of importunity and
   the failure of the supply of excuse. There is the constraint of
   conscience, which sends men into service impelled by the sense of duty.
   But even the conscience-labourer may toil and toil away in a fruitless
   task. Men may do their duty unwillingly, and the absence of the will
   deprives their service of the very atmosphere which would render it
   efficient. Duty, without the inclination of the will, is cold and
   freezing, and never makes a warm and genial way into the hidden
   precincts of another's soul. If I were stretched in pain and sickness I
   would not care to be nursed by duty. All the attentions might be
   regular and methodical, and yet I should mourn the absence of the
   something which makes the ministry winsome and alive. "I just love to
   have her near my bed," said a hospital patient to me the other day,
   speaking of her Christly and consecrated nurse. That is duty with an
   atmosphere. It is duty transfigured. Duty may make people righteous;
   alone it will not make them good. "And scarcely for a righteous man,
   will one die; yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to
   die." I do not think that duty will carry us far into the deep hungers
   and weaknesses of our fellow-men. We need the "plus," the gracious
   inclination of the will, the leaning of the entire being in the line of
   service. We need to be swayed, not by the compulsion of external
   pressure, not even by the lonely sovereignty of the moral sense, but by
   an inward constraint, "warm, sweet, tender," the unfailing impulse of
   grace, abiding in us as "a well, springing up into eternal life." "Not
   of constraint, but willingly."

   Secondly, our service must be the service of affection. "Nor yet for
   filthy lucre, but of a ready mind." [Verse 2] We are not to be moved in
   our service by any hunger for external reward, and do not let us think
   that external rewards are exhausted under the single category of money.
   Men may take up Christian service to enrich their purse, to enlarge
   their business, and in many ways to advance a transient interest, But
   we may also labour in the hunger for recognition and applause, and I am
   not sure which of the two occupies the lower sphere, he who hungers for
   money, or he who thirsts for applause. A preacher may dress and smooth
   his message to court the public cheers, and labourers in other spheres
   may bid for prominence, for imposing print, for grateful recognition.
   All this unfits us for our task. It destroys the fine sense of the
   shepherd. It destroys his perception of the needs and perils of the
   sheep. It despoils us of our bread, and robs us of our staff, and we
   have neither food nor protection to offer to our hungering and
   endangered fellow-man. "Not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind." Do
   thy service, not for the praises and rewards of men, but as Martin
   Luther says, "from the very bottom of the heart, out of love to the
   thing itself, out of joyous devotion to the work which the Lord thy God
   gives thee."

   The service of willingness! The service of affection! It must also be
   the service of humility! "Neither as lording it over the flock . . .
   gird yourselves with humility, to serve one another." [Verses 3-5] That
   is most subtle and needed counsel. Who would have expected that
   spiritual pastors would be warned against lordliness and pride? Who
   would have imagined that men who are ministering the gospel of
   lowliness should themselves be exalted in pride! It is one of the most
   insidious temptations which beset the working disciple of Christ. Pride
   ever lurks just at the heels of power. Even a little authority is prone
   to turn the seemly walk into a most offensive strut. But the peril is
   subtler still. While I assume to feed my brother, my own soul may be
   a-hungered. While I am helping his defence, the enemy may be ravaging
   my own land. The peril is subtler still. Some how we come to find a
   virtue in preaching and teaching, and our preaching and teaching become
   our doing. Teachers and preachers are somehow allured outside their own
   message--its evangel and its warnings--and we are solaced and soothed
   by the lonely fact that we have shared in its proclamation. It is a
   terrible temptation, and if we yield to it, it swells the heart with
   lordliness and pride. What is our security? "All of you gird yourselves
   with humility." Put on the apron of the slave! Go into the awful
   presence of the Lord, and contemplate His glory until the vision brings
   you wonderingly to your knees! "Go, stand on the mount before the
   Lord." That is the place where we discover our size! No man speaks of
   his greatness who has been closeted with God. Lordliness changes into
   holy fear, and pride bows down in reverent supplication. Oh, we must
   come from the Presence-chamber into the pulpit! Nay, the pulpit itself
   must be the Presence-chamber, and the man must preach in the
   consciously realised presence of the Almighty and Eternal God. The Lord
   will have no proud men in His service. Such men are self-appointed. "I
   never knew you." Their names are not to be found in the Lamb's Book of
   Life. "God resisteth the proud." He stands in the way and fights them!
   "The angel of the Lord stood in the way for an adversary." It is an
   appalling thought; our strongest antagonist may be the Lord whom we are
   professing to serve. "God resisteth the proud." Let us hasten to add
   the complementary evangel. "And giveth grace to the humble." It is the
   humble, kneeling soul that receives ineffable outpourings of Divine
   grace. Grace ever seeks out the lowliest.


   It streams from the hills,

   It descends to the plain.

   To the humble soul God gives the very dynamics of fruitful service. In
   all spiritual ministry it is only grace that tells. Nothing else
   counts! Other gifts may amuse, may interest, may allure, but grace
   alone can engage in the labour of spiritual redemption. The servants of
   the Lord are to be filled with grace, and their overflow will
   constitute their influence upon their fellows. Out of them shall flow
   "rivers of water of life." " God giveth grace to the humble."

   Lastly, it must be the service of trustfulness. "Casting all your
   anxiety upon Him, because He careth for you." [Verse 7] Take your
   alarms to Him. Talk out your fears with him. Lay them upon Him in quiet
   assurance. And this must be done in the interests of spiritual economy.
   Terrible is the waste of spiritual energy which results from anxiety
   and fear. To allow anxiety to rear itself in the soul is like
   permitting rank weeds to grow in the flower-bed; and the worthier
   growths, being deprived of nutriment, grow faint and droop away. "He
   careth for you." In these high matters the Lord is doing the thinking.


   Oh, could we but relinquish all

   Our earthly props, and simply fall

   On Thine almighty arms!

   And what is to be the reward of such services? "When the chief Shepherd
   shall be manifested . . ." [Verse 4] Some day we are to see Him face to
   face. What then? "Ye shall receive the crown of glory." The victory
   crown will be composed of leaves and flowers which will never fade
   away; of leaves which are the tokens of abiding spring; of flowers
   which are the tokens of ever-enriching glory.

THROUGH ANTAGONISMS TO PERFECTNESS

  1 Peter v. 8-10

   Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion,
   walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: whom withstand stedfast in
   the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your
   brethren who are in the world. And the God of all grace, who called you
   unto His eternal glory in Christ, after that ye have suffered a little
   while, shall Himself perfect, stablish, strengthen you.

   "The devil . . . walketh about, seeking whom he may devour." [Verse 8]
   Peter's memory is here helping Peter's message. [Reminiscence is
   shaping his counsel. It does seem as though at times this apostle dips
   his pen in his own blood. At any rate, the living crimson of his own
   experience abundantly colours the page. The epistle is hortatory: it is
   also biographical. The document is alive. It unfolds a faith; it also
   records a pilgrimage. In the passage which is immediately before us one
   feels how the life emerges as the commentary upon the message. Let me
   for a moment identify portions of this dim background, and set them in
   relation to the text. Here is the foreground, "God . . . who called
   you." Here is the background, "And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after
   Me." Here is the text, "Be watchful." Here is the context, "Simon,
   Simon, sleepest thou? Couldst thou not watch one hour?" Here is the
   warning, "Your adversary, the devil . . . walketh about, seeking whom
   he may devour." Here is the reminiscence, "Simon, Simon, Satan hath
   desired to have thee." Here is the evangel, "The God of all grace . . .
   will make you perfect." Here is the experience, "Thou art Simon
   [hearer]; thou shalt be Peter" [a rock]. I say that this man's
   life-blood stains his speech. His words are life, not the expression of
   speculation, but the utterance of a travail, the ripe judgments of a
   man who has "known and felt." And now he lays down his pen for a moment
   and surveys his chequered days. He notes the innumerable allurements
   which have beset his path. He recalls the gay fascinations, the
   incentives to pride, the lure of power, the bewitchment of personal
   ambition. He marks the violence of vice, the tempestuous charge of
   passion, the terrific onrush of the blind and brutal forces of
   persecution. And all these confront the lonely wayfarer as he picks his
   way towards God. Life abounds in moral antagonisms. The empire of
   devilry runs right up to our gates. The destructive mouth is open on
   every side. The flesh lusts against the spirit. Life is filled with
   moral menace! All this the apostle sees as he contemplates his own
   pilgrimage, and so he takes up his pen again and writes this warning to
   his young, inexperienced, and somewhat wilful readers, "Your adversary
   the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may
   devour."

   I think there is something very suggestive in the figures employed by
   the Bible to describe the approaches of the powers of evil and night.
   The devil has a fairly extensive wardrobe, but his common and more
   familiar guises are of three types--a serpent, an angel of light, and a
   roaring lion. It is in one or other of these three shapes that the
   forces of sin most frequently assail us. They come in the guise of the
   serpent. They beguile our senses. They pervert our judgment. They
   enchant our imaginations. We are fascinated, bewitched, paralysed by
   the influence of some illicit and unclean spell. The love of money
   becomes a fascination. It holds a man as under a wizard's spell.
   Gambling becomes a bewitchment, a kind of spiritual bondage, in which
   the poor soul, in mesmerised inclinations, is slowly drawn towards its
   own destruction. The devil approaches as a serpent, and like fixed and
   stupefied birds we are in peril of dropping into his devouring jaws. He
   comes also in the guise of an angel of light. He poses as an
   evangelist. He plays the rôle of one whose ministry it is to deepen our
   conception of the love and graciousness of God. He tells us that we do
   not think highly enough of God. He loves us too much to be pained by
   our small neglects. In fact, we best show our confidence in God by
   disregarding these neglects. Our trust is altogether too elementary and
   straight. We should cast ourselves down from a few pinnacles, and
   display to all men what a wonderful confidence we have in the out
   stretched everlasting arms of God! Such is the devil as an angel of
   light. Such is the devil as the preacher of the exceeding breadth of
   our Father's love. Such is the devil intent on easing the strain of our
   religious life, relaxing its severities, and putting our feet into the
   way of a more spacious providence and peace. He would turn religion
   into thin refinements; he would convert a deep devotion into a glozing
   plausibility; and he would transform a hallowed trust into light and
   flippant presumption. And the devil also comes as a roaring lion. The
   subtlety of the serpent is laid aside; he discards the sheen of the
   angel of light; he appears as sheer brutal force, an antagonist of
   terrific and naked violence, bearing down his victims under the heavy
   paws of relentless persecution. "When the apostle wrote this letter,
   the lion was about; Nero was at work; the Christians were being hunted
   unto death, in the vain attempt at stamping out their faith and
   devotion to the Man of Nazareth, their Saviour and their Lord. He comes
   as a serpent, as an angel of light, as a roaring lion. He came to the
   Master as a serpent when he offered Him worldly power. He came as an
   angel of light when he sought to deepen and enrich His trust. He came
   to Him as a roaring lion in the blows and blasphemies of the
   bloodthirsty multitude. This antagonism we have got to meet. How can we
   meet it in the hope of certain triumph? Let us turn to the apostle's
   counsel.

   "Be sober." [Verse 8] The culture of sobriety! See to Verse 8 it that
   you are not intoxicated, drugged into any kind of perilous stupor. Keep
   your head clear. Be collected. "Be sober." Now, the apostle is writing
   to men and women who are professedly the followers of Jesus Christ, and
   I think there are two perils in the religious life, both of which have
   their issue in moral stupor. We can lose our senses in excitement, and
   we can lose them in sleep. There are perils in sensationalism, and
   there are perils in encroaching drowsiness. There is the stupor which
   accompanies exaggeration, and there is the stupor of indifference.
   There is an excessive emotionalism which offers no barriers against the
   incursions of the devil. That is the peril of all revivals. Men may
   "lose their heads," and their very excitement fosters a moral
   drowsiness which gives hospitality to the besetting forces of
   temptation and sin. It is among the highly emotional races that we find
   the profoundest moral sleep. "Be sober." If your spirit be fervent, at
   all pains let it be clear. "The spirits of the prophets are subject to
   the prophets." And on the other side there is the moral stupor which is
   the issue of a growing indifference, frequently initiated by small
   neglects. A man neglects the pointing of his house; damp enters; chills
   are born; disease is invited; death reigns. Relaxation in trifles is
   often the beginning of moral benumbment. Or it may be that a Christian
   man begins to take his pleasures in injurious measure. He used to
   sojourn in them; now he lives in them. "He that liveth in pleasure is
   dead." The helpful potion has become an illicit drug. Taken in
   homoeopathic doses the pleasure was a tonic and restorative; taken in
   larger measure it became an opiate, and sank the life in perilous
   sleep. "Whether our stupor be occasioned by excitement, or by neglect,
   or by dram-drinking, whether of alcoholic liquor or of drugging
   delights, such stupor gives the devil his opportunity, and offers him
   an open field in which his triumph is inevitable. "Be sober."

   "Be watchful." [Verse 8] The culture of perceptiveness! Not only be
   sober, but thoroughly awake, exercising your perceptions to the rarest
   and most fruitful refinement. We know the large possibilities which
   allure us in the cultivation of the physical senses; equally large
   possibilities glow before us in the culture of the soul. Every exercise
   of watchfulness ensures us stronger sight. In the quest of the Divine
   we come to self-possession. In this line of culture the progress is
   from the greater to the less. The moral senses perceive ever finer and
   finer essences of good and evil. Moral progress is in the direction of
   the scruple. The finest scholar in the school of Christ is he who has
   the rarest perception of the moral trifle. "He that doeth the least of
   these commandments is greatest in the kingdom of heaven." Therefore,
   exercise thy moral senses, lest the hordes of evil should enter through
   the gates of unperceived neglects. "Be watchful."

   "Stedfast in the faith." [Verse 9] The culture of faith! Our faith has
   to be "stedfast," firm, solid, impenetrable like a wall. Our faith has
   to be "stedfast," a rampart of assurance, close, compact, and
   invulnerable. I have spoken of the cultivation of the moral sense, and
   of its progress in the detection of the trine. Here we are taken to a
   plane of still higher education, the culture of the spiritual sense,
   the apprehension of God, proceeding toward the goal of calm and
   invincible assurance. To be stedfast in faith is to be sure of God. The
   grand attainment necessitates continual exercise, the "practice of the
   presence of God." We must exercise our spiritual muscles in the
   ministry of communion with God, in praise and prayer and supplication
   and intercession; the exercise must be a wrestling, determined and
   continuous, until there steals into our life an awed sense of the
   Divine presence, and in the calmness of assurance we can confidently
   say, "I know that my Redeemer liveth." How, then, shall we resist the
   devil, in whatsoever guise he may appear to us? By the culture of
   sobriety; by the culture of moral perceptiveness; and by that culture
   of spiritual apprehension which will lead us into the peace which is
   strength--"the peace of God which passeth all understanding."

   Now, let me carry your minds forward a moment to the contemplation of
   the all-sufficient dynamic, which may be ours in this inevitable
   conflict with the powers of evil and night. The culture of sobriety,
   the culture of perceptiveness, the culture of faith will open out our
   lives to Him whom the apostle calls "the God of all grace," [Verse 10]
   and by His presence we shall be energised. "The God of all grace!" It
   is a beautiful and wealthy phrase, suggestive of varied endowment for
   varied and changing need. My need is manifold; the grace of God is also
   "manifold." It will fit itself to my need as light or heat, as water or
   bread. My God is "the God of all grace," now like sweet sunshine, now
   like burning flame, now like refreshing dew, now like the falling,
   softening rain. "The God of all grace," a tower and a sword, my refuge
   and my shield. "My grace is sufficient for thee"; sufficient amid the
   beguilements and fascinations of the serpents; sufficient amid the
   plausible refinements of the angel of light; sufficient amid the
   apparently destructive forces of the lion of violence and persecution.
   The whole personality, in every faculty and power, shall be pervaded
   with Divine forces, and in thy God thou shalt find an exuberant
   fountain of mercy, goodness, and compassion. "My God shall make all
   grace to abound towards you."

   And what is to be the ultimate glory? "The God of all grace . . . shall
   Himself perfect, stablish, strengthen you." [Verse 10] Perfected!
   Established! Strengthened! Settled! They are all architectural
   metaphors, and are massed together to suggest the fine wholeness,
   consistency, finish and security of the grace-blessed character as it
   will appear upon the glorious fields of light! "Established," every
   layer firmly and securely based! "Strengthened," splendidly seasoned,
   with no danger of splitting or of warping! "Settled," the entire
   structure resting evenly, comfortably, upon the best and surest
   foundation! These are the metaphors, and they unveil before me future
   attainments of blessedness, when the grace-filled character shall
   appear before God like a firm, well-finished, and gloriously
   proportioned building; all the manifold faculties co-operating in rare
   association; every power firm, decisive, and sanctified, and the entire
   life settled in holy calm and comfort on "the one foundation, Jesus
   Christ our Lord."

   Now, see the glorious range of the entire passage. "The God of all
   grace, who called you unto His eternal glory." [Verse 10] That glory is
   not altogether remote. Even now we are beginning to share it. The
   spring is not yet here, but the lark is up! Glory awaits us in
   Emmanuel's land; but we are finding heavenly tokens by the way.


   The man of grace hath found

   Glory begun below.

THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER
     __________________________________________________________________

LIBERTY! EQUALITY! FRATERNITY!

  2 Peter i. 1, 2

   Simon Peter, a bondservant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that
   have obtained an equally precious faith with us in the righteousness of
   our God and Saviour Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied
   in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.

   WHEN I had read this passage through many times in my effort to
   discover the inwardness and sequence of the apostle's thought, there
   leapt into my mind the great watchword of the French Revolution,
   "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity!" My text seemed to accept the proffered
   ministry of the watchword, and deigned to express itself through the
   heightened and glorified clarion of the Revolution. Here is the secret
   of liberty: "A bondservant and apostle of Jesus Christ." [Verse 1] And
   here is the basis of equality: "They that have obtained an equally
   precious faith with us." And here is the very genius of fraternity:
   "Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of
   Jesus our Lord," [Verse 2] Here, then, we have the apostolic evangel of
   liberty, equality, and fraternity.

   Here is the secret of liberty: "A bondslave of Jesus." [Verse 1] At the
   heart of all true freedom there is a certain bondage. Liberty without
   restraint is always self-destructive. The man who will not be bound to
   anything or anybody is always the most enslaved. Even anarchist
   societies are compelled to have some rules, and the making of a rule
   always implies the forging of a chain. Liberty must be limited if it is
   to be possessed. Every type of freedom has its chains. That is true of
   intellectual freedom. A man who would be intellectually free must pay
   obeisance to certain laws of thought. Mental disorder is a dark
   enslavement. The movement that springs from obedience to the laws of
   thought is a fruitful freedom. Free thought begins in wearing a chain;
   the mental freeman is at heart a slave. That is true also of political
   freedom. Political freedom consists in the recognition of individual
   rights. To assert my brother's rights is to state a limit to my own.
   Here again we start with a chain. We recognise limitations. The real
   political freeman is at heart a slave. And this is true also of moral
   freedom; no man is morally free who does not pay homage to his
   conscience. Moral freedom springs from the sense of obligation. Apart
   from that ligament, that bond, the whole body of the moral life falls
   limb from limb in inextricable chaos and confusion.

   Now let us lift the argument up to the highest type of freedom, the
   glorious freedom of the spirit. A great writer has denned the French
   notion of liberty as political economy and the English notion of
   liberty as personal independence. The Christian conception of liberty
   is inclusive of these, but infinitely greater. The most spacious of all
   liberties is liberation from self, and this kind of freedom springs
   from initial bondage. True freedom in the spirit begins in bondage to
   the Lord of Life. I am not surprised, there fore, that the; Apostle
   Peter and the Apostle Paul, men who sing so loudly and so triumphantly
   of the wealth and plenteousness of their freedom, should begin by
   proclaiming themselves the Master's slaves. "Paul, a bondslave of
   Jesus." "Peter, a bondslave and apostle of Jesus Christ." Bondage is
   the secret of freedom.

   "Peter, a bondslave." Let us see what is implied in this suggestive
   word. First, the term "bondslave" implies the acknowledgment of a fact.
   He is a slave. He has been bought. He is the Lord's property. A great
   price has been paid for him. The apostle thought of his Master's weary
   days and nights, of the tears and agonies of Gethsemane, of the shame
   and darkness and abandonment of Calvary. By all this expenditure on the
   part of the Saviour the apostle had been bought. He acknowledged his
   Master's rights; he was his Master's slave. Secondly, the term
   "bondslave" implies the assumption of an attitude. The apostle puts
   himself in the posture of homage and obedience. His eye was ever
   watching the Master, his ear was ever listening. He was a slave, but
   not servile. I do not know what word just expresses it; I have been
   unable to find one. But this I know, that if we would learn what
   "slave" means in my text we must go to the love-sphere and seek the
   interpretation there. We must go where the lover slaves for the loved,
   and yet calls her slavery exquisite freedom. A real loving mother,
   slaving for her child, would not change her slavery for mines of
   priceless wealth or for unbroken years of cushioned ease. "Thy willing
   bondslave I." And thirdly, to be a slave implies the discharge of a
   mission. "Peter, a bondslave and apostle." He is sent forth to do the
   Master's will. The Master bids; he goes. Anywhere! Through the long,
   dusty, tiring highways of righteousness, or to the valley of gloom;
   "through the thirsty desert or the dewy mead."


   His not to reason why,

   His not to make reply,

   His but to do and die!

   But in that bondage the apostle finds a perfect freedom. All the powers
   of his being are emancipated and sing together in glorious liberty.
   Life that is fundamentally bound be comes like an orchestra, every
   faculty constituting a well-tuned instrument, and all of them
   co-operating in the production of a harmony which is well-pleasing in
   the ears of God.

   And here we have the basis of equality: "To them that have obtained an
   equally precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God." [Verse
   1] Let us rearrange the words a little. This I think is the meaning: in
   the righteousness of God, the absolute justice and fairness of God, you
   have obtained an equally precious faith with us. God in His
   righteousness has, in this consummate gift of faith, made us gloriously
   equal. Now look at that. Where does the apostle begin his reasoning
   about our primary equality? He begins with the righteousness of God.
   God is perfectly fair. He is no respecter of persons. I know this faith
   is troubled and disturbed by the material inequalities we see around
   us. Here is my little one safe at home in bed, and here is another
   little one, not much older, out upon the streets in the late night
   hungry and cold. Is God fair? Here is a good man in chronic pain; here
   is a bad man in health and wealth and honour. Yet God is righteous in
   His purpose! He does not treat us like puppets and marionettes. He has
   endowed us with brain and conscience and heart and will, and He has
   committed to us the power by which many of these gross in justices can
   be rectified. If the Church of the living God were to awake from her
   sleep to day you and I know how much could be done to rearrange
   material comforts, and to crush and destroy many things which make for
   misery, disease, and death. While our sword is rusting, and our couch
   has almost become our tomb, do not let us raise a mere debating-society
   topic and ask the question: Is God fair? It is for our own dignity, and
   for the disciplining and perfecting of the race, that our God has
   committed unto us the power by which many of these burdensome
   iniquities may be removed. But, leaving all these, let it be said that
   in the great primary things, the things out of which all other
   equalities take their spring, we may be grandly equal. We may all
   obtain an equally precious faith, the faith-dynamic which can remove
   mountains. Faith itself is a gift of God, and in this all men may be
   equal. You and Paul! The Salvation Army Captain and Martin Luther!
   "Precious faith," the apostle calls it, precious because of the wealth
   which through it comes into the life. "Faith buys wine and milk," says
   an old commentator. Faith goes| into the country of God among His
   vineyards, and out among His fields, and eats and drinks the rare and
   sweet and toothsome things. I say that in this great primary matter we
   may all be equal, and in this fundamental equality all other healthy
   equalities will find their impulse and resource.

   And lastly, we have here the genius of fraternity. "Grace to you and
   peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus." [Verse 2]
   How deep and exquisite is the spirit of fraternity!" What do these
   people seek for one another? Knowledge! "Knowledge of the Lord." And
   this means the advanced stages of a science, the most perfect learning,
   the riper unfoldings of the glory of God. They are ambitious for one
   another, that spiritual obscurities may be clarified, and that the
   partial may be perfected. A little while ago, at the dawning of the
   day, I looked out over a great stretch of country from the vantage
   ground of a lofty summit. I could only see things dimly, in vague and
   imperfect outline. There beneath me lay stretched out into the far
   distance a long, white streak of dull silver; and there rested a grey
   cloud; and yonder loomed a dark botch which seemed to be a remnant of
   the departing night. But the light came on apace, and my knowledge was
   advanced and perfected. The thin white streak turned out to be a river!
   The bank of grey mist revealed itself as a lake! The dark botch, which
   seemed like the belated baggage of the night, revealed itself as a
   forest! "The glory of the Lord shall be revealed." "Now I know in part,
   but then. . .!" "Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge
   of God." Out of this advanced and advancing knowledge there is to come
   a multiplication of grace and peace. Grace is to be multiplied; the
   single drops are to become showers; the solitary rays are to glow like
   the noon. And peace is to be multiplied, deepened, heightened, and
   enriched! Is not this the very genius of fraternity? What thing more
   beautiful can brotherhood grow than wishes and intercessions like
   these?
     __________________________________________________________________

THE CHRISTIAN'S RESOURCES

  2 Peter i. 1-4

   Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have
   obtained an equally precious faith with us in the righteousness of our
   God and Saviour Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied in
   the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord; seeing that His Divine
   power hath granted unto us all things that pertain unto life and
   godliness, through the knowledge of Him that called us by His own glory
   and virtue; whereby He hath granted unto us His precious and exceeding
   great promises; that through these ye may become partakers of the
   Divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world
   by lust.

   HERE is the apostle reckoning up his resources in the spirit. What has
   he got in the bank? Divine power, glory, virtue. [Verse 3] How is the
   wealth of the bank given out to him? In "exceeding great and precious
   promises"; in "all things that pertain to life and godliness." And what
   is accomplished by this abundant and lavishly distributed wealth? "That
   through these ye may become partakers of the Divine nature, having
   escaped from, the corruption that is in the world by lust." [Verse 4]
   Where had the apostle gained the knowledge of his resources? He had
   found them in the fellowship of the Lord Jesus, and he was never weary
   of reciting his discovery to others. We may be sure that when the
   Apostle Paul went up to Jerusalem, and tarried with Peter, it would be
   of these marvellous riches that the saintly fisherman would speak. "I
   went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days."
   This well-trained and expert student, who had sat at the feet of
   Gamaliel, and who had proved to be one of his most alert and
   progressive disciples, goes up to Jerusalem to sit at the feet of
   another teacher, the fisherman Peter from the Galilean lake! "I went up
   to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days." The pupil
   of Gamaliel wanted to hear from the lips of the fisherman all that his
   memory could recall and all that tongue could tell of those three
   eventful years! Long into the night they would sit and talk; long after
   the last wayfarer had gone home, and the sounds in the streets were
   stilled! The pupil could never get enough of the story, and the teller
   of the story never grew tired in its recital, and many times, in those
   crowded fifteen days, the dawn looked in through the lattice and found
   these sleepless men still busied in the story of their Lord. Peter
   would lead the eager and reverent steps of his new kinsman all the way
   across the years--the call on the beach that made him a disciple, the
   strange revealing miracle on the lake, the sermon on the hill, the
   private communions with the twelve when the crowd had gone away, the
   awful and overwhelming splendour of the transfigured Presence on the
   Mount: then in hushed and broken voice Peter would tell of Gethsemane,
   of the betrayal, of the scene among the servants in the hall, of his
   own denial, of his Master's broken-hearted look, of the scourge and the
   crown of thorns, and the ribaldry and agonies of Calvary; and then the
   fisherman-teacher would recover his tone and feelings again as he
   related the wonders of the Resurrection, and all the gracious surprises
   of those altogether surprising forty days, until this pupil of
   Gamaliel, this once-while persecutor of the Saviour, could scarcely
   tell whether he was in the body or out of it! Depend upon it, those
   fifteen days with Peter left uneffaceable marks upon the mind and soul
   of Paul.

   Well, now, ours is not the privilege of hearing that story from the
   lips of the fisherman-saint; but if I look at my text aright I think
   that here Peter puts his finger upon what he conceived to be the three
   great characteristics of his Master's life. It is something to have the
   words this man employs when his eyes sweep across the marvellous
   experiences which he had been privileged to share. What does he think
   about it all? What are the things which stand out in predominant
   distinction? If there are hills and mountains in a life altogether
   superlative, what are the mountains? And here, I think, is the
   apostle's answer, given in three of the great words which lie like the
   great foundations of my text--His "Divine power," His "glory," His
   "virtue."

   That is supremely interesting as coming to us from one so human, so
   altogether akin to us as the Apostle Peter. When he flings his mind
   back in the contemplation of his Master, he summarises his ever-fresh
   impressions in the words, "power," "virtue," "glory." That is what
   Peter found in the Lord: and that is what we may find in the Lord
   to-day.

   What have we in the bank? Divine power. [Verse 3] In what had Peter
   witnessed the power? He had marvelled at the Master's power over Him
   self. He had stood in silent wonder as he gazed at Jesus
   self-possession and self-control. It was all so opposed to his own
   self-distraction, his self-dissipation and indecision. He had marked
   his Master's power of patience, His refusal to be hurried into any
   precipitate action, His quiet waiting for the appointed time: "Mine
   hour is not yet come." He had witnessed the Lord's inexhaustible
   patience in the presence of His foes. How full of waiting gentleness He
   was through all those three years! How He bore with Judas, and how
   eagerly He watched for signs of his return. He knew him, He pleaded
   with him; even when Judas was intent on betrayal He held him as by a
   hair. And Peter had seen the Lord's patience with His friends. It takes
   an immense storage of power to be patient with dull people. And the
   Lord's disciples had been very dull, and they had imbibed the lessons
   very slowly. "Do ye not yet understand?" "Oh, slow of heart to
   believe!" And yet the lesson had been quietly repeated, and no sign of
   irritableness was witnessed in the Master's speech and behaviour. He
   condescended to the level of the dullest-witted disciple, and patiently
   bore with him as he learned the elements of the gospel of grace. I say
   Peter had gazed upon all this--it had been a daily phenomenon--and now
   when he looked back upon it all, and recalled his impressions of these
   marvellous years, he was re-impressed with the wealth of the "Divine
   power" of his Redeemer.

   But Peter had also witnessed the Master's power over others. He had
   seen His trans figuring influence over their souls. He had seen faces
   illumined by His touch. He had watched the lighting up of a darkened
   life. He had seen the rekindling of a Magdalene and the restoration of
   a Zaccheus. He had seen the cold, paralysing burden of guilt fall away
   at the imperative of the Lord's command: "Thy sins be forgiven thee."
   And when the once paralysed body buoyantly stepped away from the
   Master's presence, Peter detected behind the released body a quickened
   and liberated soul.

   Peter had also seen the transfiguring power of the Lord upon the minds
   of others. He had seen Him break the tyranny of mental bondage, the
   sovereignty of vicious thinking, and he had seen the oppressed stand
   clothed and in his right mind. He had finally witnessed the Lord's
   power over the bodies of men. He could command the forces of health,
   and they came at His bidding. He could marshal them as an army and
   antagonise disease and drive it away. He had seen leprosy pass out of a
   man's face like a tide retiring from the beach. He had seen the mystic
   element of life return into a vacant body, and all its functions and
   faculties were restored. Is there any wonder that, when Peter gazed
   back upon all these things, his soul should bow in holy reverence in
   the contemplation of the Master's power?

   What else did the apostle find emphasised in his retrospect? He was
   confronted by the all-predominant peak of the Lord's "virtue." [Verse
   3] The moral goodness of His Master was never away from his sight. And
   let us remember that Peter now uses words with the Saviour's contents.
   He is judging his Master by the Master's own standards. There are many
   ways of using the same word, but he employs it in the highest
   significance. A scavenger may use the word "clean" as descriptive of a
   freshly swept road; a surgeon may use the word "clean" as applied to
   the instruments prepared for an operation; but how exacting is the
   second usage as compared with the first! And here is the word "virtue."
   As employed by the world it has a very impoverished content, a kind of
   mere scavenger significance; but when employed by the Master it
   embraces absolute purity in the profoundest depths of the life. And I
   say Peter applies the Lord's own standard to the Lord's own life, and
   he pronounces it full of virtue. He had listened to His conversation,
   and never for one moment had the print of an unclean or unfair word
   crossed his Master's lips. He had seen Him in His dealings with others,
   and never had a suggestion of double-dealing appeared in His behaviour.
   He had seen Him in His public life, and marked how He had rejected the
   help of all immoral auxiliaries and of all short cuts to a coveted end.
   He had refused the ministry of fire and the support of the sword, and
   the countenance and patronage of kings. "Wilt thou that we call down
   fire from heaven?" He would have none of it. "Lord, here are swords!"
   "They that take the sword shall perish by the sword." "Then Herod
   questioned with Him in many words." "He answered him nothing." Peter
   was astounded at the austerity and holy sovereignty of his Master's
   "virtue."

   And there is one other peak on which the apostle gazed when he surveyed
   the three wonderful years--the peak of Divine "glory" [Verse 3] What is
   glory? It is the bloom of character. It is majesty issuing in grace. It
   is solar glory falling upon infirm eyes in rays of softest shining. It
   is holiness consummated in tenderness. It is truth in the radiant robes
   of mercy. It is the splendour of the Godhead shedding itself abroad in
   the delicacy of love. We must never dissociate grace from majesty; in
   reality we are unable to do it, but we are sorely tempted in thought to
   make the division. In literal truth we can no more dissociate them than
   we can separate the sun from the sunlight. "We beheld His glory, full
   of grace and truth." So that when we are contemplating the glory of the
   Lord we are among the holy tendernesses, the majestic gentlenesses, the
   incorruptible love which forgives and is never denied. Glory is the
   manifested presence of the Lord; warm and gentle as sunshine, and clean
   and pure as fire. Such are the outstanding characteristics of the
   Master's life as recalled by this fisherman-seer, the man who once
   shrank from his Master in the awful consciousness of a tremendous
   disparity, but who now longs and prays for an even closer and intimate
   communion.

   Having named these three great significant wealths in the Lord Jesus,
   the apostle now proclaims them as the possible resources of all men.
   Because these riches are in the Lord Jesus they constitute a reservoir
   of treasure from which all His disciples can draw. It is wealth in the
   bank, and to us is given the privilege and the right to draw out from
   the bank and find mercy and grace in every time of need. What, then,
   may we get from this Lord of power and virtue and glory? We may obtain
   "precious and exceeding great promises." [Verse 4] Now, what is a
   promise? In our modern usage it is rather a light-weight word. It is
   often used as synonymous with "wish," and it carries no heavy
   significance. But the word as used in the New Testament has a far wider
   and vaster content. A promise of the Lord has a threefold purpose: it
   reveals an ideal, it kindles an ambition, it inspires a hope. We may
   take any promise we please in the Word of God, and we shall find it
   enshrines the secret of this threefold ministry. Take, for instance,
   the promise "I will give you rest." Here we have the revelation of the
   ideal--the restful life, the harmonious life; not the still life of a
   mountain tarn, but the full, brimming life of the river. Rest is not
   the repose of stillness; it is the absence of friction, the music of
   co-operation. Here, then, is an ideal. As I contemplate it, it kindles
   an ambition, and my soul covets the gracious inheritance. A gospel
   promise trans forms ambition into a mighty hope, and in the strength of
   a great expectancy the promised thing becomes possessed. So it is with
   all the promises of the Lord. They are "exceeding great" the ideal
   stretches across the life and fills the firmament; and they are
   "precious," pregnant with the possibility of inconceivable enrichment.
   But all this is not enough. A promise may reveal an ideal, and it may
   kindle an ambition, and it may inspire a hope, and yet it may fail to
   confer an operative endowment. I am not surprised, therefore, to find
   that the apostle goes on to record the gift of an endowment which is as
   sure as the word of the promise. "His Divine power hath granted unto us
   all things that pertain unto life and godliness." [Verse 3] In the Lord
   the believer has not only promise, but equipment. "All things that
   pertain to life!" The life that now is! Whatever is requisite for a
   splendid life we may assuredly find in our Lord. It is not needful to
   have a strong body, but it is essential to have a fine judgment, and
   this we may find in the Lord. "The meek will He guide in judgment." "I
   will counsel thee with Mine eye upon thee." "He that followeth Me shall
   not walk in darkness, but shall be the light of life." It is not
   needful to have a heavy purse, but it is essential to have a sweet
   temper, and this we may find in the Lord. A harsh and ugly temper is
   not only destructive to one's own peace, and mars one's own work, but
   it works havoc upon the peace and ministry of others. "Love suffereth
   long"; it is a fine, chaste, gracious temper, one of the commanding
   things that pertain to life and godliness. It is not needful to have a
   great following, but it is essential to have a companionable
   conscience, and this we may find in the Lord. A man has got a splendid
   travelling companion when he is on good terms with his own conscience.
   And a man is weak, miserably weak, even with the support of a
   multitude, if his own conscience is ranked among his foes. "A good
   conscience" is one of the things that pertain to life, and we may find
   in the bank "a conscience void of offence." "The things that pertain
   unto life" are not the things that are commonly named; and "the things
   that pertain unto life and godliness" are still more rarely found upon
   the lips of men. "The things that pertain unto life and godliness" are
   such things as I have named--a good judgment, a sweet temper, a
   companionable conscience, and above all, and as the root of all, the
   gift of faith, the gift of love, the fruits of forgiveness, the grand
   sense of reconciliation with God, which form the glorious inheritance
   of every man in Jesus Christ our Lord. And all this we may take out of
   the bank, "exceeding great and precious promises," filling one's life
   with a vast ideal and with a fervent ambition and with an ardent hope;
   and "all things that pertain unto life and godliness," everything that
   is needful for the attainment of moral and spiritual strength and
   perfectness.

   And so we have looked at our wealth in the bank, the power and virtue
   and glory of the Lord. And we have looked at what we can draw out of
   the bank--"exceeding great and precious promises"; "all things that
   pertain unto life and godliness." And what is to be the end of it all?
   What is our possible destiny? "That through those ye may become
   partakers of the Divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that
   is in the world by lust." [Verse 4] So the ministry of the wealth is to
   effect a deliverance and a glorious adoption! We are to escape one
   thing and find refuge in another. Here is our deliverance, "having
   escaped the corruption that is in the world." Alas! we can be in no
   doubt as to the presence of corruption. It is everywhere about us; in
   this corruption men and women are everywhere enslaved. The enslavement
   has various guises. Dante, in the Divina Commedia, tells us that when
   he turned from the desert plain to scale the shining mount he
   encountered three beasts. And first


   A leopard, supple, lithe, exceeding fleet,

   Whose skin full many a dusky spot did stain.

   He found a leopard in the way, a beast which typified the love of
   sensual beauty, and in this beastliness many souls are enslaved. And
   then he met a lion


   Who seemed as if upon him he would leap,

   With head upraised and hunger fierce and wild.

   In the lion he typified the pride of strength, the vanity of perilous
   independence. And in this servitude how many souls are enslaved? And
   then he met a she-wolf--


   A she-wolf with all greed defiled,

   Laden with hungry leanness terrible,

   That many nations had their peace beguiled.

   And the she-wolf typified the spirit of greed, the imprisoning bondage
   in which many souls are enslaved. These three beasts are ever found in
   the way of the man who would leave the level plain and take the shining
   slope. He will meet the leopard and the lion and the wolf. But in
   Christ we have the means of deliverance. We can pass the beasts in
   safety, and "escape the corruption that is in the world through lust."
   And with the deliverance there comes the glory of adoption. From the
   company of beasts we are translated into the fellowship and family of
   God. We "become partakers of the Divine nature." We draw upon the power
   of the Lord, the virtue of the Lord, the glory of the Lord! More and
   more does the beauty of the Lord rest upon us and within us. We become
   ever more finely endowed with the unsearchable riches of Christ. "We
   are transformed into the same image from glory to glory."

DILIGENCE IN THE SPIRIT

  2 Peter i. 5-9

   Yea, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your
   faith supply virtue; and in your virtue knowledge; and in your
   knowledge temperance; and in your temperance patience; and in your
   patience godliness; and in your godliness love of the brethren; and in
   your love of the brethren love. For if these things are yours and
   abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful unto the knowledge
   of our Lord Jesus Christ. For he that lacketh these things is blind,
   seeing only what is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old
   sins.

   IN our previous meditation we were considering the vast resources which
   are the inheritance of every believer in Christ Jesus. "We gazed upon
   our bullion in the bank. We reverently contemplated the "exceeding
   great and precious promises," and we bowed in awe before the
   overwhelming ministry of God's redeeming grace. And now what shall we
   do with these stupendous resources? "We must not allow the Divine
   wealth to soothe us into slumberous and perilous impotence. If the Lord
   makes us to "lie down in green pastures," it is only that by the
   gracious renewal wo might be enabled to walk in "the paths of
   righteousness for His name's sake." Therefore "for this very cause add
   on your part all diligence." [Verse 5] It is a demand for business
   vigilance in the realm of the spirit. "We are not to close our eyes and
   allow our limbs to hang limp, in the expectancy that the Lord will
   carry us like blind logs. He made us of clay, but he formed us men, and
   as men He purposes that we shall live and move and have our being. And
   so He calls for "diligence." It is a word which elsewhere is translated
   haste, carefulness, business. It is very wonderful how commonly the New
   Testament takes its similes from the commercial world. "Trade ye
   herewith till I come." "Look therefore carefully how ye walk, buying up
   the opportunity." "The kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchantman."
   In all these varied passages there is a common emphasis upon the
   necessity of businesslike qualities in our spiritual life. We are
   called upon to manifest the same earnestness, the same intensity, the
   same strenuousness in the realm of spiritual enterprise as we do in the
   search for daily bread. And yet how frequent and glaring is the
   contrast between a man's religious life and his life in the office or
   upon the exchange. His life seems to be lived in separate compartments;
   the one is suggestive of laxity and a waiting upon happy luck; the
   other is characterised by a fiery ardour and keen sagacity. There is
   method in the office; there is disorder in the closet. But here, I say,
   is a demand that men should be as businesslike in winning holiness as
   in seeking material wealth. We must bring method into our religion. "We
   must find out the best means of kindling the spirit of praise, and of
   engaging in quick and cease less communion with God, and then we must
   steadily adhere to these as a business man adheres to well-tested
   systems in commercial life. We must bring alertness into our religion;
   we must watch with all the keenness of an open-eyed speculator, and we
   must be intent upon "buying up every opportunity for the Lord." We must
   bring promptness into our religion. When some fervent impulse is
   glowing in our spirits we must not play with the treasured moment; "we
   must strike while the iron is hot." "Now is the accepted time, now is
   the day of salvation." We must bring boldness into our religion. Timid
   men make no fine ventures. In the realm of religion it is he who
   ventures most who acquires most. Our weakness lies in our timidity.
   Great worlds are waiting for us if only we have the courage to go in
   and possess them. "Why are ye fearful, ye of little faith?" And we must
   bring persistence into our religion. We must not sit down and wail some
   doleful complaint because the seed sown in the morning did not bring
   the harvest at night. We must not encourage a spirit of pessimism
   because our difficulties appear insuperable. We must go steadily on and
   wear down every resistance in the grace-fed expectancy that we shall
   assuredly win if we faint not. Such are the characteristics of common
   diligence which we are to bring into co-operative fellowship with the
   forces of grace. "Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He shall
   stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men."

   Assuming, then, that these business qualities and aptitudes are being
   brought into the ministry of the Spirit, we must now address ourselves
   to the expansion of our spiritual traffic, to the enrichment of our
   souls, and the enlargement of our spiritual stock. "In your faith
   supply virtue; and in your virtue knowledge; and in your knowledge
   temperance; and in your temperance patience; and in your patience
   godliness; and in your godliness love of the brethren; and in your love
   of the brethren love." [Verses 5-7] It is surely the addition of ever
   new departments to the wealthy interests of the soul! But let us mark
   that the endeavour after enlargement must have precise and distinctive
   aim. It is one of the perils of the religious life that we so
   frequently lose ourselves in vague and pointless generalities. Our
   confessions of sin have no pertinence, and our aspirations after
   holiness have no shining peaks. We must define our ambitions, and let
   them glow before us as distinct and radiant goals. It was a wise old
   monk who wrote, "We must always have some fixed purpose, and especially
   against those sins which do most of all hinder us." The principle is
   equally effective and applicable in the pursuit of virtue. What do I
   lack? Let me examine myself. It will probably be found that the things
   which most displease me in others are just the things which most
   characterise myself. Am I impatient? Let me supply it. Do I lack
   self-control? Let me supply it. Is my love of the brethren wanting in
   range? Let me supply it. But can we supply these additions at will? Ah,
   but the writer of this Epistle is not beginning with ethical counsel.
   He began by taking us round the bank and showing us the mighty
   resources on which we can draw. And then, after the contemplation of
   our wealth, he assumes that we are taking possession of it by faith,
   and that in the strength of that faith we are translating our strength
   into holy attainment in common life. It is a will that is rooted in
   God, and from God is drawing the strength it needs, which is engaged in
   this active ministry of adding to its moral and spiritual treasures.
   And a will so set can attain unto anything, and can become clothed in
   the superlative beauties of the likeness of Christ.

   But here, now, is a vital principle; every added virtue strengthens and
   transfigures every other virtue. Every addition to character affects
   the colour of the entire character. In Ruskin's great work of Modern
   Painters, he devotes one chapter to what he calls "The Law of Help."
   And here is the paragraph in which he defines the law: "In true
   composition, everything else not only helps everything else a little,
   but helps it with its utmost power. Every atom is full of energy. Not a
   line, not a speck of colour, but is doing its very best, and that best
   is aid." It is even so in the composition of character. Every addition
   I make to my character adds to the general enrichment. The principle
   has its reverse application. To withdraw a single grace is to
   impoverish every element in the religious life. "For whosoever shall
   keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, is become guilty of
   all." We cannot poison the blood in one limb without endangering the
   entire circulation. But it is the positive application of the principle
   with which we are now concerned. And the graces are a co-operative
   brotherhood, they are interpervasive, and each one lends energy and
   colour to the whole. We cannot possibly supply a new grace to the life
   without bringing wealth to all our previous acquirements. For instance,
   here is "godliness." Godliness by itself may be very regular, and at
   the same time very icy and very cold. It is like a room without a fire.
   But now "in your godliness supply love." And what a difference a fire
   always makes to a well-furnished room! Love brings the fire into the
   cold chamber, and godliness becomes a genial thing with a new glow upon
   it, and a new geniality at its heart. But the love thus supplied not
   only enriches godliness, but every other grace as well. What a
   tenderness it gives to patience, and what a soft beauty it brings to
   self-control! Take love away from the circle of the graces, and they
   are like a varied landscape when the sun is hid behind the clouds. "In
   your faith supply . . . love." And so on, with never-ceasing additions,
   for ever enriching the entire life of the soul.

   Men who bring such business-like qualities into the sphere of their
   religion, and who are continually enriching their spiritual stock, make
   a lasting contribution to the common weal. "For if these things are
   yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful unto the
   knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ." [Verse 8] Such lives are "not
   idle," they are active; they are not "unfruitful," they are efficient.
   Surely one could not find two words more descriptive of a worthy and
   positive life; it is active and efficient. It is active and efficient
   on the side of reception, the whole life being gloriously open to the
   incoming of the Divine; it is active and efficient in the ministry of
   impartation, communicating itself in rich currency to the interests and
   affairs of the world. "We become the best and the most active and the
   most efficient citizens when we contribute to the common life the gift
   of sweet and perfected dispositions. A poor but sanctified life is a
   magnificent civic asset! Who can compute the value to a community of a
   character enriched by patience, by self-control, by brotherly kindness,
   and by love? Such characters are moral health centres; they bring ozone
   into the crowded thoroughfares of common life. That is the true
   efficiency, as indeed that is the true success, which makes an enduring
   contribution to the common wealth. Such things can never die.

   What then? If we are businesslike, continually adding to our spiritual
   stock, and thereby contributing to the common weal, what will be the
   issue? The apostle expresses the issue in negation. "He that lacketh
   these things is blind." [Verse 9] Then if a man possess these things he
   is consequently endowed with sight. Every supplied grace enlarges the
   spiritual vision. Every refinement of the disposition is the
   acquirement of an extra lens. And now I think of it, my text is like a
   vast drawn-out telescope, with lens after lens added, ever contributing
   to the intensity and extension of its range. See how it runs: "Add
   virtue, and knowledge, and temperance, and patience, and godliness, and
   love of the brethren, and love!" What seeing power a man will gain with
   a telescope like this! But lacking these things I should only see
   things that are near, and there will be no distant alluring vision, and
   every thought will be of the immediate day. Lacking "these things,"
   bread is bread alone; let these things be added, and our daily bread
   becomes a sacrament through which we see the very beauty of the Christ.
   Without "these things," affliction becomes a dark and a heavy deposit;
   let "these things," be added, and we can see its issue in "a far more
   exceeding and eternal weight of glory." Drop "these things," and life
   becomes a thing of purely transient import, a jostle and a squabble for
   a slice of bread. Let "these things" be added, and life becomes endowed
   with eternal significance, and every little duty becomes an open gate
   into the infinite world. And so the apostle concludes his exhortation
   by re-emphasising his kindly and urgent counsel. "Wherefore, brethren,
   give the more diligence." [Verse 10] Let every atom of energy be
   devoted to your holy cause. Never let your prayers be scrimped and
   niggardly! Do not enter into life maimed, and so escape corruption by
   the skin of your teeth! Seek to win life, and to win it well, "for thus
   shall be richly supplied unto you an entrance into the eternal kingdom
   of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."

THE SANCTIFICATION OF THE MEMORY

  2 Peter i. 12-15

   Wherefore I shall be ready always to put you in remembrance of these
   things, though ye know them, and are established in the truth which is
   with you. And I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to
   stir you up by putting you in remembrance; knowing that the putting off
   of my tabernacle cometh swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ
   signified unto me. Yea, I will give diligence that at every time ye may
   be able after my decease to call these things to remembrance.

   "I shall be ready always to put you in remembrance of these things.
   [Verse 12] And what things are these? We have seen how the earlier
   counsels of this great chapter are disposed. It is as though we had
   first a description of rare and fertile soil, and then a catalogue of
   the marvellously bountiful fruits which can be grown in it. Or to
   change our figure, it is as though the earlier verses are descriptive
   of every man's banking account, and the later verses point out the
   possible issues of vigilant and aggressive enterprise. The whole
   passage begins in the general endowment of grace and peace, and it
   finishes in the glorious possibility of an abundant entrance "into the
   eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."

   "I shall be ready always to put you in remembrance of these things." It
   is vital that we remember this connection between soil and fruits,
   between capital and labour. It is all-important that we hold the
   apostolic teaching that the Christian gospel is not a theory to be
   defended, but an inheritance to be explored and enjoyed. The Christian
   is not first an apologist, or even an evangelist, but an
   experimentalist, dealing personally with the proffered grace and power
   of his Lord. At every moment the Christian is both passive and active,
   passively receiving the redemptive power of grace, and actively working
   it out in rich and perfected character. He is both suppliant and
   ambassador; he communes with God, he intercedes with man. He is not
   separately a man of the cloisters or a man of the street; he is both in
   one. He keeps in touch with the tremendous background of grace in order
   that he may fill his foreground with the fruits of grace in Christian
   life and duty. He brings the infinite into the trifle, and he knows
   that without the powers of eternal salvation he cannot redeem the
   passing day. In a word the Christian takes knowledge of his resources
   and does not dare to seek to live his life without them. He remembers
   "these things."

   But is it not a strange thing that we should ever be inclined to forget
   them? We should surely assume that whatever other things we might be
   inclined to forget we should always remember that we are spiritual
   millionaires. Is it possible that in doing the little business of life
   we can ever forget our buried capital in the Lord, the treasure laid up
   for us in heaven, and seek to win spiritual success without it? Yes,
   all this is a grave possibility, and therefore the apostle ardently
   labours to keep our remembrance alert. Memory is such a child of
   caprice, even in purely human matters! The memory is in the habit of
   playing curious pranks. We can remember people's faces, but we forget
   their names. We remember a story, but we forget its date. We can repeat
   all the marriage relationships of the royal house, but we forget the
   steps of even a short argument. We can recall the unessential, and we
   forget the fundamental. "Memory is a capricious witch; she husbands
   bits of straw and rag, and throws her jewels out of the window." And
   certainly in higher relationships our memory gives us no better
   service. We remember a single injury and we forget a multitude of
   gracious benefits. We remember material experiences and incidents, but
   we forget the things which most profoundly concern our peace. There is
   therefore surely great need for the strenuous word of the apostle. And
   it is as urgent upon us as upon the men and women of his own day that
   we vigorously set about to exercise and sanctify the powers of our
   remembrance.

   Now, what can we say about it? Let us begin here. The intensity of our
   remembrance very largely depends upon the depth of the original
   impressions. Some incidents bite deep into the mind, like acid into
   metal; they are not printed, but graven; not written, but burned. Other
   impressions are like the writing upon the steamed window-panes of a
   railway carriage; let the outside atmosphere get a little warmer and
   they pass away in an hour. Now the depth of the impression is
   determined by the vividness of the vision. If our gaze is cursory the
   impression will be transient. How does all this bear upon our
   remembrance in the spirit? It has this most crucial bearing; our
   impressions are fleeting because we do not give sufficient time to
   receive them. The vision does not bite! What can a man know of the
   country of Uganda by careering through it in a railway train? What can
   a man know of the wealth and glory of our National Gallery if he takes
   the chambers at a gallop? If he is to retain a lasting and a vivid
   remembrance he must sit down before one of the masterpieces, and allow
   himself to steep in the contemplation of its glory. It is quite
   impossible to take a snapshot of the interior of a cathedral. If the
   exquisite tracery, and even the dim outlines of the structure, are to
   be captured, it will be done as the issue of a long exposure. And so it
   is with the vastness of our inheritance in Christ. Our visions come
   from long exposures; we have got to sit down reverently and gaze upon
   the glory of the Lord in prolonged contemplation. We sometimes sing,
   "There is life for a look at the Crucified One!" That is scarcely true
   if by look we mean a transient glance, a passing nod, a momentary
   turning of the eyes. "There is life for a gaze" and that life is
   continuous only so long as the gaze is retained. If we only glance upon
   the Master we shall forget the impression at the next turning of the
   way; the enemy will come, and will snatch away that which was sown in
   our hearts. The strength of our memory depends upon the depth of our
   impressions.

   It is equally true that the intensity of the remembrance also depends
   upon the studied preservation of the impressions. There are forces ever
   about us that minister to erasion and oblivion. I noticed the other day
   that the workmen were engaged upon a very conspicuous monument in
   London, deepening the inscriptive letters which told the heroic story.
   The corrosives of time had been at work upon the once deep impressions,
   and they were being gradually effaced. And so it is with the lines in
   our memory; time is hostile to their retention, and is ever at work
   seeking their effacement. And so the impressions need to be
   periodically deepened and revived. Have we any ministries for effecting
   this purpose? Yes, I think we have many. A place can do it. If you go
   back to the little village where you spent your early days, how the old
   life comes back to you as you tread the accustomed ways and turn the
   familiar corners! How the sight of an old well can recall an
   experience, and even a drop upon the bucket can revive feelings which
   carry you back to your youth. And a place can sometimes refresh and
   deepen a spiritual impression. I wonder if Simon Peter ever went back
   to the court of the High Priest's palace! I warrant he never passed
   near the door without the fountain of tears being unsealed, and the
   stream of penitential feelings flowing anew. There was a little place
   in a garden to which Thomas Boston used to repair whenever he wanted to
   quicken his early love for the Lord. It was his spiritual birthplace,
   and the very place seemed to abound in the ministry of regeneration. It
   would be an amazingly fruitful thing if some of my readers, whose
   spiritual fervour is growing cool, and whose early conception of the
   Lord is becoming faint, would spare a day to go to the place where
   first they knew the Lord, and I warrant that the sacred spot would
   re-deepen the lines of their early covenant, and they would find
   themselves revived. It would be a great day in many a man's life if he
   would go back to the little village church, and sit for one Sunday in
   the seat which he occupied when there broke upon his wondering eyes,
   the vision of the glory of his Lord. For a place can renew the lines of
   our remembrances.

   And a thing can do it. An apparently commonplace thing can recall a
   conspicuous history. I have known the scent of a flower unveil a day
   which seemed to have been buried in permanent obscurity. I never get
   the fragrance of the common dog-rose without my memory leaping back to
   an old-fashioned garden in the North, and peopling that garden with
   presences now gone, and awaking experiences which are pregnant with
   inspiration and peace. But the principle has higher applications still.
   A piece of broken bread can recall the broken body of the Lord, and a
   cup of wine can become the sacramental minister of the blood of the
   Lamb. Can we afford to forget these helpmeets of grace? Even the
   superlative verities of our faith sometimes grow dim to our eyes, and
   we temporarily lose our hold upon them. Let us make use of every means
   appointed by the Lord, if perchance our memory may be revived and these
   fruitful sanctities may be retained.


   When I survey the wondrous Cross

   On which the Prince of Glory died,

   My richest gain I count but loss,

   And pour contempt on all my pride.

   An incident can do it. How frequently it happens that the hands busy
   themselves in doing a thing which has not been done for many years, and
   the little action draws the curtain back from our youth. I played a
   little game the other day which I had not played since boyhood, and in
   very literal feeling I was a boy again, and all the past environments
   round about my feet. And it is even so with activity of a higher kind.
   That bit of Christian work you dropped, and the dropping of which has
   brought such a heavy penalty of spiritual degeneracy and recoil! Take
   it up again! Your Lord's grace was very real to you then! Take it up
   again, and you will find that in that God-blessed work your remembrance
   is revived, the effaced impressions have deepened again, and you have
   the old inspired vision of the glory of the Lord. Go to it again, I
   say, and your soul shall be restored. In all these ways, by a diligent
   determination to give ourselves time to receive our spiritual
   impressions, and by cherishing all the ministries by which the
   impressions can be preserved, it is possible to sanctify our memories
   and to make them temples of the living God.

   But in our text the apostle puts himself forward as a helpmeet of other
   men's remembrances. "I shall be ready always to put you in remembrance
   of these things." [Verse 12] It is a gracious prerogative that we can
   minister to one another in holy things. It is possible for one man to
   rouse another man's memory to the recollection of the things of the
   Spirit, and to revive his sense of the superlative grace and goodness
   of God. But this ministry of remembrancer is one that requires the
   utmost delicacy if its exercise is to be hallowed and fruitful. The
   phrase in my text, "to put you in remembrance," literally signifies to
   remind quietly, to mention it under one's breath, to gently suggest it!
   There are two ways of performing the function of remembrancer. We can
   approach our brother like an alarm bell, or we can bear upon him like a
   genial breathing. We can rouse some people quite easily by drawing up
   the blinds and letting in the light. There is no occasion for the
   rattle of artillery; it is quite enough to let the sunshine in. And
   there are some men who seem to be spiritually slumberous who do not
   require some angry indictment, but only a gentle hint of spiritual
   resource. Here is a man who is down; his troubles have multiplied on
   every hand; and in the depth of the depression he has forgotten
   everything but the calamity itself. Now here is an opportunity for the
   Lord's remembrancer! But how unwise it would be to come with all the
   clatter of a fire-engine, and the accompaniment of a clanging, rousing
   bell. The only effective approach would be one of exquisite delicacy.
   We must approach the man as a nurse would touch a patient who is full
   of sores, and in tones of the softest compassion we must remind him
   that he is a millionaire, and that he has untold capital in the bank of
   the Lord. But, oh, the tact of it! See that fine touch in the apostle's
   ministry: "I shall be ready always to put you in remembrance . . .
   though ye know them." [Verse 12] How delicate the courtesy!" I have
   nothing new to tell you, but you and I have both got the Lord, haven't
   we? I say the delicacy of it; it was the very inspiration of the Holy
   Ghost. "It shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak."

   And this ministry of remembrancer is one that must not be delayed. The
   man's memory is getting numb. His early spiritual impressions are being
   effaced. The glory of the Lord is waning. The distant heaven is growing
   dim. Let not the remembrancer wait; let him set about his Christlike
   work in the assurance that the King's business requireth haste. "I
   think it right . . . knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle
   cometh swiftly." [Verses 13, 14] The remembrancer himself is only here
   for a time: he has but a day at the most: let him be up and about! The
   night cometh! But how beautiful the apostle's conception of the coming
   night! Life is a pilgrimage in tents, and to-morrow he will pull up the
   tent-pegs and depart to "the city that hath foundations." But meanwhile
   he must be active, deepening the lines in the memory of his
   fellow-disciples. "Yea, I will give diligence that at every time ye may
   be able after my decease to call these things to remembrance." [Verse
   15] He will do something to ensure the continuance of his ministry,
   even when he has gone home. "After my decease!" After my exodus! When
   he has left his Egypt and found his Canaan, the far-off land across the
   Jordan, the ministry of remembrancer shall be maintained. I think that
   every time they recalled the apostle, when he had gone home, the very
   memory would act as a restorative of their own spiritual experiences,
   and the depth of their early devotion would be regained.

   Let us reverently and diligently see to the sanctification of our
   memories. Let us periodically inspect our impressions. Let us watch if
   we are in any way forgetful of our spiritual inheritance. Are we
   remembering our capital? Do we look like millionaires, or are we like
   beggars whose memories have utterly lost the significance of their
   grand estate? Lord, help us to remember what we ought never to forget!

THE TRANSFIGURED JESUS

  2 Peter i. 16-18

   For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto
   you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were
   eyewitnesses of His majesty. For He received from God the Father honour
   and glory, when there came such a voice to Him from the excellent
   glory, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: and this
   voice we ourselves heard come out of heaven, when we were with Him in
   the holy mount.

   "We were eyewitnesses of His majesty" [Verse 16] --eyewitnesses of the
   mystic glory in which the Lord was arrayed, and by which He was
   possessed upon the Mount of Transfiguration. The passage has reference
   to the superlative splendour which shone about the Lord upon what we
   call the "Mount of Transfiguration." "We were eyewitnesses of His
   majesty." When I had written that phrase upon my paper I looked up at
   my study walls, and I caught sight of Munkacsy's great picture of
   "Christ before Pilate," and the contrast between the mount of glory,
   when the majesty of the Lord was witnessed by the apostles, and the
   shame and the ignominy of the judgment hall, was to me positively
   startling. "We were eyewitnesses of His majesty." I looked at the
   picture, and there was Pilate, bullet-headed, with short-cropped hair,
   with lustreless eyes, with effeminate mouth, and a most irresolute
   chin--Pilate, clothed in the garment of a little brief authority,
   disposing of the Maker of the world. And then the crowd! Fierce men
   with clenched fists in an attitude of threatening; faces made repulsive
   by passion; Pharisees in long, tasselled garments, yelling "Crucify
   Him, crucify Him!" other Pharisees bowing before the Lord in profound
   but mock obeisance; other Pharisees, with curling lips of scorn and
   contempt, looking on with sheer disdain; two or three women, with babes
   in their arms, gazing with the fascination of terror; one woman
   fainting, supported by a man who has the only gentle face in the crowd;
   and there, hiding in the very thick of the fierce mob, Judas Iscariot,
   with a face all alert with fear, and eyes in which there is already
   visible the flame of remorse; and added to all this a ring of impassive
   Roman soldiers, and one or two wondering little children, and a stray,
   terrified dog! And before all this mass of yelling and blood-seeking
   fanatics there stands the Lord! Upon His exposed breast there are the
   weals of the scourge. The plait of thorns is crushed down upon His
   brow; His hands are manacled; they bear the reed, the mock symbol of
   sovereignty; His face is perfectly white, wearied, sorrow-stricken, and
   yet there is an upward look, as though His eyes were piercing the
   gloom. Yes, I say, I looked at that when I read Peter's words, "We were
   eyewitnesses of His majesty"; and I say the contrast was perfectly
   startling, for there seemed to be little radiance or glory as He stood
   there, bound and helpless, the victim of the tyrannous crowd. But, in
   reality, is the radiance of the transfiguration in any way dimmed by
   the ignominy and the tragedy of the later days? Has the glory which
   shone upon the mount been in any way eclipsed by what is now taking
   place before Pilate? By no means. In Pilate's judgment-hall the glory
   and majesty of the Lord had not departed; and it came to me, and I knew
   it as I gazed upon the picture in my study, that somehow that picture
   of the tragedy had to help me to explain the Transfiguration. The
   Transfiguration upon the Mount finds its explanation in the Passion.

   What preceded the journey up the mount? What had taken place before the
   disciples and the Lord took their journey away to the mount? Can we get
   at their mind? If I may use a somewhat common phrase to-day, what was
   their "psychological mood"? What was their mental content when they
   began to climb the hill? What had been the last emphasis of the
   Master's teaching? Had they any fear? Had they any special hope? How
   had they begun to climb the mount with Jesus? What were the last things
   in His private expositions which probably filled their minds? Happily
   for you and for me the matter is made perfectly clear. The very last
   thing we are told about our Lord's converse with His disciples is this:
   a , little while before, and for the first time, the shadow of the
   Lord's death was flung upon their sunlit and prosperous way. "From that
   time"--this was only just before the climb began--"From that time began
   Jesus to shew unto His disciples how that He must go unto Jerusalem and
   suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be
   killed." I want you to think of that as suddenly entering into the
   programme. It had never been whispered before, and now, when the way
   was becoming more and more sunny, and the crowds becoming more and more
   loyal and multiplied, when the day was just dawning, and the Lord's
   kingdom just appearing, He begins to talk about His own suffering and
   death. I do not wonder that the announcement from the Master's lips
   startled and staggered and paralysed them. Why, the teaching darkened
   the whole prospect!" That shall never be unto Thee, Lord," cried the
   ardent and impulsive Peter. "Get thee behind Me!" I think there is no
   preacher who can say that word in the Master's tones, "Get thee behind
   Me!" It was not said in savage severity, but in the pleadings of love.
   He felt the allurement of the disciple's words, "That shall never be
   unto Thee, Lord!" "Don't, don't, My beloved friend! Tempt Me not away
   from the gloom; thy friendship is seeking the victory of the evil one."
   And then He gathered them round about Him and began to expound unto
   them the law of life. "Whosoever will take thy way, Peter, whosoever
   will save his life shall lose it, and whosoever will lose his life
   shall find it." He began to expound unto them the law of life through
   death, fulness through sacrifice. If we would live we must die; if we
   would find ourselves we must give ourselves away. He began to say unto
   them that He would suffer and be killed! And then He laid down for them
   the great condition of fellowship: "If any man would come after Me, let
   him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me."

   Well now, that is the mental furniture, that is the psychological mood
   which possessed the disciples as they turned to climb the slopes of the
   mount. They were under the shadow! To them had just been made a
   suggestion of the coming death of their King. They had had teaching
   about crosses, and losses, and sacrifice; and yet, through it all, a
   wonderful promise woven of ultimate victory. We must go back to that
   word about the cross, and self-denial, and the law of life; and when we
   climb the mount of transfiguration we must take it as a key to the
   glory, and to all that awaits us there.

   "And then," we are told, "Jesus taketh with him Peter," with his mind
   filled with these things, "and James," and his mind filled with these
   things, "and John." "Jesus taketh!" That word "taketh" is an
   exceedingly feeble and unsuggestive English word. The word that lies
   behind it is full of pregnant significance. It is precisely the same
   word which, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, is translated "offered." "He
   taketh with him." It is not an ordinary journey. It is the solemn
   beginning of a walk which is to end at an altar, and that an altar of
   sacrifice. "He taketh with Him Peter, and James and John," and they
   begin the solemn walk leading them up to the great surrender, the place
   of glorious sacrifice. "He taketh them into a high mountain, apart,"
   and this too, in the evening time. Let us pause there for a moment.
   There is always something so solemnising about the evening.


   Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,

   And all the air a solemn stillness holds.

   Somehow in the gathering twilight God seems to come very near. And this
   experience receives emphasis when it is evening time upon the heights,
   when the clouds are coming back like tired vagrants to rest awhile upon
   the summits; when there is nobody near, and nobody can be heard,
   except, perhaps, some belated shepherd, gathering his flock together
   for the night. He led them unto a mountain apart, "and He prayed." Let
   us get the scene well fixed in our imaginations. The Master is away up
   in the mountain; the heavy dews are lying upon the grass: that breeze
   is softly blowing, the breeze which seems to be always moving upon the
   lower slopes of Hermon, perhaps cooled by the snows beyond. And there
   He kneels, the Master, the Lord, and He prays! I want us to realise
   that all prayer is more than speech with God. Prayer is infinitely more
   than pleading. I sometimes wish I say it with the utmost
   deliberateness--I sometimes wish we could drop the word "plead" quite
   out of our religious vocabulary. We so frequently pray as though we had
   got an indifferent and unwilling God with whom we have to plead. The
   cardinal necessity in prayer is not pleading, but receiving. I do not
   believe--I say it with, a full sense of responsibility--I do not
   believe we have any more need to plead with God to bless than to plead
   with the air outside to come into a building. It is not so much
   pleading that is required as the making of an inlet. God is willing.
   Prayer is simply communion; the opening up of channels of
   companionship; the opening out of mind, the opening out of will, in
   order that into the open mind and will and conscience there may flow
   the Divine energy and the Divine grace. "Jesus prayed," and I know that
   when it is said "Jesus prayed," it means that He was absolutely open to
   the infinite. Surely that is the meaning of prayer. When a man prays,
   if he prays aright, he is simply opening himself out to the incoming of
   God. God says: "Behold! I stand at the door and knock; I enshrine and
   surround you like the atmosphere." Prayer is conscious receptiveness in
   the presence of the Divine. Jesus, upon the mountain height, in the
   evening time prayed, He opened Himself to God, the Infinite, and the
   Infinite began to possess Him.

   "And as He prayed He was transfigured." I am not surprised at that.
   Even among men we have seen the ministry of transfiguration, even
   though it be in infinitely smaller degree. You remember that Moses had
   been so opened out to God, and so possessed by the Divine light, that
   when he came down from the mount his face shone with mystic radiance.
   "We are told concerning Stephen that he was so opened out to the
   Infinite that they saw his face as it had been the face of an angel. He
   was simply possessed and pervaded by the Divine power. And surely one
   may say, as I can say, that in far humbler life than that of Moses, in
   life in which there has been little of what the world calls "culture,"
   little of mental furniture, little of dialectical power, but in which
   there has been great spiritual receptiveness, in the lives of the
   illiterate there has shone "a light that never was on sea or land." But
   here with the Master, whose life was absolutely and uninterruptedly
   opened out to the glory of the God-head, the inflow of glory
   transfigured and transformed Him, and in superlative and supreme degree
   "His face did shine as the sun." The very expression of His countenance
   was altered. And then the historians go even further, for we are told
   that the glory, the energy, I scarcely know how to describe it--one
   uses an almost violent phrase in seeking to give expression to it--the
   Divine effluence which flowed into the Lord not only transfigured His
   flesh, but in some mystic way transfigured even His outer vesture. "His
   garments became white as snow." All of which just means this: that this
   man of Nazareth became so absolutely filled with God that His very
   material vesture was transfigured and transformed. "We were
   eyewitnesses of it."

   Now, I would like to pause there a moment, to offer an opinion for
   which I cannot quote Scriptural authority. "This say I, not the Lord."
   I would venture to ask: What would have happened if man had never
   sinned? I think, just what happened on the mount. I have a conviction
   that this experience on the mount was just the purposed consummation
   for every life. I have a conviction that if there had been no sin you
   and I would never have known an open grave. We should have known a
   transformation, a transfiguration; there would have been a consummation
   in which the material would have been transfigured and transformed
   through the importation of the Divine glory. The corruptible would have
   put on incorruption, but not through the ministry of decay and death;
   just by the ministry of an inflow of Divine glory. I think that was our
   purposed end, and our purposed glory. I think that from the very day of
   our birth our road would have led ever forward and ever forward into
   light. There would have come a certain moment in the temporal life of
   everybody when the glory of the Lord would have absolutely possessed
   us, when the material shrine would have been transfigured, and we
   should have reached the higher plane of the immortal life. But sin
   came, and that consummation could never be. Instead of on some quiet
   evening just being transfigured into the immortal, we have now to take
   the way to the shades, the way of the grave. But Jesus never sinned,
   and therefore I think that upon the mount His life was naturally
   consummated, and He could have entered into the permanent glory which
   then possessed Him.

   But now, mark you, I say that our Master, with a perfectly holy life,
   came there to a natural consummation, in which His life was
   transfigured, and He might, I think, then have passed into the state of
   enduring glory. But He divests Himself of the glory, lays it aside,
   turns His back, as it were, upon the natural consummation, and takes
   the way to the grave. He turns from the appointed way of glory, the
   glory of sinlessness, and He takes the way appointed of sin. That is
   what I call the great renunciation; and I sometimes think that instead
   of calling it the Mount of Transfiguration we might call it the Mount
   of Renunciation. He would not claim the natural consummation. He would
   not claim the transfiguration. He takes up the cross even upon the
   mount; He takes the way of His brethren in sin; He came to do it; He
   leaves the glory, and He comes down the mount that by coming down the
   mount He might make for you and for me a new and living way by which
   we, too, can reach the consummation. "See, He lays His glory by!" He
   turns His face towards the grave.

   Do you think there were no fears in His renunciation? I very frequently
   wish that we did not so divest our Lord of all attributes common to the
   flesh. Do you think our Master was altogether delivered from the common
   fears of man in the prospect of death? No fear of death, and that a
   death of such absolute abandonment, and of so unspeakable and un
   thinkable isolation? I think when He turned His back upon that glory,
   glory to which He had a right, and faced towards the grave, He felt a
   chill, the chill of a nameless fear. I know that on another mountain,
   when the devil came and tempted Him, and He then turned His back upon
   the offered sovereignty, "angels came and ministered unto Him." And I
   do not wonder that now, when, upon the mount of another renunciation,
   He turns His back upon the glory and contemplates death, there appeared
   unto Him two other ministers--Moses and Elijah: Moses who died no one
   knew how, and was buried no one knew where; and Elijah, who was
   transfigured that he should not see death. And then we are told in just
   one phrase, which although it does not satisfy, yet relieves our
   wonder, that they spoke together of the decease that He should
   accomplish at Jerusalem. Perhaps it is permitted us to indulge in a
   little reverent imagination? Here is the Lord turning His back upon
   glory and facing the chills of death, and there appears to Him from the
   other side of death Moses and Elijah, and surely their conversation
   about His decease would be heartening! It would be feeding speech, and
   sustaining speech, by which He would be able all the more boldly and
   all the more fearlessly to take His journey into twilight and night.
   And so, I say, our Saviour began His descent from glory to grave. It is
   not the going up the mount that cheers me, it is the coming down! Every
   step He took in that descent gives confirmation to your hope and to
   mine. Our ascent becomes possible in His descent.

   And as He turned to go, and laid His shining glory by, behold! a voice,
   "This is My beloved Son." [Verse 17] It was a great renunciation on
   Christ's part, but it was a great gift on God's part, and I think that
   on the mount of renunciation, when our Lord begins His descent, and the
   Father says, "My beloved Son," we can in all reverence and truth add
   the other great word: "God so loved the world that He let Him lay His
   glory by"; "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son."
   Down the mount He comes, on to Golgotha and the grave! Did not I say
   that the Transfiguration finds i^s explanation at the Passion? When I
   see Him coming down the mount, I can say with Paul, "He loved me and
   gave Himself for me." It is through our Lord's renunciation of glory
   that we become glorified. When I turn my face to the mountain-height,
   where the Apostle Peter was an eyewitness of the majesty of God, and
   when I think that that glory was the purposed consummation for every
   life, that I, if I had never sinned, might have been similarly trans
   figured into the immortal state, I wonder how the blest estate can be
   regained. And here is the answer:


   There is a way for man to rise

   To that sublime abode:

   An offering and a sacrifice,

   A Holy Spirit's energies,

   An advocate with God.


   These, these prepare us for the sight

   Of holiness above;

   The sons of ignorance and night

   May dwell in the eternal Light

   Through the eternal Love!

THE MYSTERY OF THE PROPHET

  2 Peter i. 19-21

   And we have the word of prophecy made more sure; whereunto ye do well
   that ye take heed, as unto a lamp shining in a squalid place, until the
   day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts: knowing this first,
   that no prophecy of Scripture is of private interpretation. For no
   prophecy ever came by the will of man: but men spake from God, being
   moved by the Holy Ghost.

   THE prophet, his prophecy, how to understand it! This passage is about
   as compact and concentrated as a crystal. It is compressed and
   solidified thinking, every sentence being as essential and as
   unwasteful as a passage of Browning. Just cast a glance at the crowded
   contents. I say it enshrines a description of the true prophet, it
   unveils the nature and significance of true prophecy, and it defines
   the only methods by which the secrets of prophecy can be disentangled
   and understood. Here is the vignette of the prophet: "No prophecy ever
   came by the will of man: but men spake from God, being moved by the
   Holy Ghost." [Verse 21] And here is the out line, the primary feature
   of prophetic ministry: "A lamp shining in a squalid place, until the
   day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts." [Verse 19] And here
   is the clue to sound and effective interpretation of prophecy: "No
   prophecy . . . is of private interpretation, for . . . men spake from
   God." [Verses 20, 21] These great guiding lines have not become
   confused by the march of time; they are as true and significant to-day
   as on the day when they were first penned, and if we would know a
   modern prophet when he appears, and be able to understand his message
   when we hear it, we shall do well to pay close and reverent heed to the
   teaching of this glorious and inspired companion of our Lord.

   "Well, now, I think it is quite as well at once, when we are speaking
   about prophets and prophecy, that we detach ourselves almost entirely
   from the modern and popular interpretation of the word. Prophecy is not
   synonymous with prediction. When we use the sentence which has almost
   become a proverbial phrase in our ordinary speech and say, "I am
   neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet," we are employing the words
   almost entirely in the sense of forecast, in the meaning of prevision,
   with the significance of unbosoming the secrets of the morrow. The
   element of prevision and of forecast is not entirely absent from the
   true equipment of the prophet, but it is not the primary element. I do
   not think any one can declare principles without forecasting issues;
   but the burden of a true prophet is not the fore casting of an event,
   but the proclamation of a principle. True prophecy is declaration, not
   anticipation; it is vision, not prevision. A prophet is a man who
   foretells, but who primarily forthtells, tells forth a message which
   God has given to him. The prophet is a forthteller of great truths, of
   dominant principles; he is a revealer of the great broad highways along
   which all the affairs of men move to inevitable destiny. I want, then,
   at once to put that primary meaning which we use in our modern
   interpretation of the word on one side, and as far as possible to leave
   aside this secondary element of prevision.

   With this introductory assumption, look at the picture of the prophet
   himself. "No prophecy ever came by the will of man." [Verse 21] Some
   things may come by human volition, but never prophecy. No man can will
   himself into the prophetic office. If he is not born there, his
   presence is an impertinent usurpation. The prophet is not the product
   of self-will, not the product of self-initiative. He is not the matured
   flower of human culture. The prophet's own will has little or no part
   in his mission or vocation. He is not a cause, he is an effect. He is
   not the wind, he is an instrument. He is not the sun, he is a
   reflector. The prophet is born, not made. No prophecy and no prophet
   ever came by the will of man. The prophet's role is not the perquisite
   of resolute purpose, or the prize of any strenuous ambition. He does
   not come by culture, but by nature. He is not made by struggle, he
   comes by birth. There is about the prophet an element which can never
   be manufactured. I think we know this deep, unnatural, unearthly,
   uncreated element in other spheres whenever a prophet appears. We can
   make rhymesters; we can easily manufacture them by the score. You can
   lay down a number of precise little rules for the making of a
   versifier; you can tell him how to measure out his little lines, how to
   regulate his metre, how to appoint his jingle. You can make a
   rhymester, but no poetry ever came by the will of man. When you are
   reading Wordsworth, you can instinctively feel when the manufacture
   begins, you can instinctively feel when the will of the poet begins to
   work, and you can instinctively feel when the manufacture ceases and
   something mysterious arrives, and the poet begins to sing. You can make
   politicians, make them by the crowd. Give a man a little programme, a
   glib tongue, a strong tincture of party loyalty, and there you are! But
   statesmanship never came by the will of man. We know the distinction
   between the political party-hack in all our political parties, and the
   man who tells forth the fundamentals, who speaks not in the mere party
   tone, but in the abiding speech of the ages. We can manufacture a
   politician; a statesman is beyond us. We can manufacture pianolas, we
   can make admirable imitations of the human fingers; we can endow the
   hammers with something of the living touch of the finger-tips, we can
   create a most elaborate and exquisite mechanism; but when we have
   finished our work we experience some nameless chill in the absence of
   mysterious life. No musician ever came by the will of man. We have to
   await his coming, and when he comes we know him by the unearthliness of
   his gifts, and the strains that breathe of another and a mysterious
   clime. And so I say we are conscious of this unmistakable element when
   ever the prophet appears, in whatsoever guise he comes. "Deep calleth
   unto deep"; there is about him a suggestion of the infinite, and we
   cannot explain him. We may not like him. It is quite probable we shall
   set about and crucify him. But there is in the prophet an element of
   mysteriousness which, though he be of our flesh and blood, links him
   with beings of quite another plane. We may not be able to define his
   distinction, but we feel it; and in these high matters of refined
   sentiment, feeling is perhaps our safest guide. Who does not feel the
   difference between Cecil Rhodes and Garibaldi? It is the unearthly
   element to which we pay our homage and our regard. Who does not feel
   the difference between John Bright and Benjamin Disraeli? What is it?
   It is the element that never came by the will of man. It is the
   difference between a spring and a cistern; it is the difference between
   glitter and glow; it is a difference unspeakable, made by the profound
   and mystic forthtelling from the Infinite. It is even so in every
   prophet, no matter what may be the garb he wears. It is so in Rudyard
   Kipling. I think his poetry is often feverish; to me, at any rate, it
   is often declamatory, sometimes inflammatory, often thoughtless. But
   again and again on the heedless page a wind springs up, and everything
   quickens, and the man is clothed in nameless inspiration, and the
   mortal puts on immortality. I say we feel it. "The wind bloweth where
   it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof," and it makes one man a
   statesman and leaves another a politician; it makes one man a poet, and
   leaves another a rhymester; it makes one man a prophet, and leaves
   another a mere speaker. "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou
   hearest the sound thereof," but thou canst not tell whence it cometh,
   nor whither it goeth." "No prophet ever came by the will of man." We
   cannot make them. What then? What suggestion does the apostle give us
   in my text as to how this indefinable and mysterious element can be
   explained? Here is the apostolic explanation: "Men spake from God,
   being moved by the Holy Ghost." [Verse 21] I like that word "moved." It
   is one of the picturesque words of the New Testament Scriptures. It is
   precisely the same word which is translated in the Acts of the Apostles
   "drive." You remember in that graphic chapter which describes the
   shipwreck of the apostle, there comes this very suggestive phrase: "And
   when the ship was caught . . . we let her drive." That is precisely the
   word which is here translated "moved." "Men spake from God, being
   moved," driven by the Holy Ghost as Paul's ship was driven by the wind.
   That is the apostolic explanation of the prophet. "Suddenly there came
   a rushing mighty wind," and they spake! It was so with Moses, it was so
   with Elijah and Micah and Amos. They were all wind-swept children of
   God, driven by mysterious currents which they could never explain. That
   is why prophets can never understand the genesis of their own mission
   and their own message--they seem to have had nothing to do with it: Why
   Thackeray, who was sometimes endowed with the prophetic calling,
   speaking about his highest work, those parts of his work which bore the
   signs of inspiration, uses these very strange words, "I have no idea
   where it all comes from; I am often astounded myself to read it after I
   have got it down on the paper." I remember a great preacher telling me
   that he often felt just in that way about some of his sermons. When he
   had preached them, or when he had prepared them, he read them over
   again with curious and devouring interest, and could not think they
   were his own. He had been moved by the Holy Ghost, and he watched with
   great inquisitiveness the discoveries revealed to him. "Men spake from
   God." [Verse 21] And that word "from"! It is in these prepositions that
   we so lack in trying to carry out the vividness of the original. It
   means right out of God, right out of the very depths of the Deity! "Men
   spake out of God!" Their speech was born in God, God-driven,
   God-controlled. That is so ever and every where, from the prophet of
   the earliest times to the last prophet who speaks to the listening ears
   of our own day. "The voice of the great Eternal speaks in their mighty
   tone." "No prophecy ever came by the will of man: but men spake from
   God, being moved by the Holy Ghost."

   So much, for the prophet. Now I turn from the prophet to the prophecy;
   and what, according to my text, is the abiding characteristic of ail
   true prophecy? Here is the guiding word: It is "as a Lamp shining in a
   squalid place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your
   hearts." [Verse 19] "As a lamp!" Then prophecy is something luminous,
   and therefore something illuminating. "A lamp shining in a squalid
   place." True prophecy always exposes the squalor of its time. When the
   prophet speaks, something shady stands revealed, something iniquitous
   stands exposed. The prophet always brings with him a light brighter
   than the twilight of accepted compromise. He comes with something of
   the light eternal; he is a lamp, and in the presence of the shining
   prophet the sins of his time come into visibility, and are named and
   declared. This is what we should expect. If we turn to the book of the
   psalmist we find these expressive words: "Our secret sins in the light
   of Thy countenance." We come into the light of the Lord's presence, and
   our secret sins leap into view, just as motes are seen in the sunbeam,
   and just as faded patches and rents are exposed in the broad light of
   the fuller day. And if a man comes from God, bearing with him something
   of this same eternal light, if he comes as a lamp, we must expect that
   the squalor and the deformity of his day will become visible before
   him. That is ever true, true of the far-off prophet Elijah. If you want
   to see the sin and the perversity and the squalor of that far-off day,
   stand near the man who has got the lamp. It is the same with the
   prophet Amos. If you want to see the rottenness of the gilded
   ceremonial religion of his day, and the injustices, and the perverted
   relationships of man to man, stand near the herdsman who has got the
   lamp. It is true of John the Baptist. If you want to see the sin of the
   times in which our Lord was born, stand near the man who has got the
   lamp. If you stand near Savonarola, you see the iniquities of Florence.
   If you stand near Thomas Carlyle, you behold the hollow shams and
   conventions of our own day. If you stand near General Booth, you will
   see the miseries and the deformities and the crookednesses of the
   submerged tenth. Until General Booth appeared we had never really seen
   them. "Darkest England and the way out." "The people who sat in
   darkness saw a great light." That is ever characteristic of prophecy.
   It reveals the squalor in the squalid place, it unveils it for the
   purpose of removing it. It reveals the darkness and corruption of the
   city by bringing into view a vision of the New Jerusalem, the city come
   down out of heaven from God. The first characteristic of true prophecy
   is that it is luminous and illuminating, exposing where exposure is
   needed. Mark the progress and sequence of my text. "A lamp shining in a
   squalid place, until the day dawn!" [Verse 19] Prophecy is not only
   luminous, it is progressive. Do you mark the increasing expansion of
   the terms? I think it is very beautiful and suggestive to notice it: "A
   lamp," "a day-star!" The dawning! and on to perfect noon! The prophet
   of to-day speaks a larger word than the prophet of the earliest time.
   Savonarola was a child of the dawning; Amos was a child of the lamp. It
   is always necessary to remember this. When I remember this, it clears
   away a thousand difficulties from the sacred page. When I go back to
   Elijah, or to Amos, or to Micah, I must not expect the large and
   comprehensive light of the dawn. I must expect lamplight, partial
   light, local light; but a lamp always shining above the current
   standard of the time. When you go back to Elijah you go from dawn to
   lamps, and the principle must guide you in your apprehension and
   appreciation of the prophet's teaching. I do not know that the electric
   light need speak altogether in such contemptuous terms of the horn
   lamp, and I do not know why the horn lamp should so fiercely and
   vehemently disparage the rush. The crucial criterion is this: Not
   whether Elijah equals Paul, and not whether Amos equals Thomas Carlyle.
   The crucial criterion is this: When Elijah held his lamp, what about
   the squalor? Was he above the current standard? Did he shine above the
   accepted compromise? Did he bring in the radiance of the ideal? When I
   go back to Amos I do not expect to see dawnlight, but lamplight. I find
   in Hosea, in Amos, many things I do not like; but I am a child of a
   richer privilege, a child of a larger day. The question is this: Had
   they a lamp which exposed the dirt? Did they bring out the squalor, and
   did they make revelations of which even we, in our own day, do well to
   take heed? The light has been progressive: a lamp for Elijah, a
   day-star for another man, the broader light of the dawning for another.
   And still the light of prophecy is progressive. We, too, are only yet
   in the early dawning; we are far away yet from the perfect noon. The
   prophet of to-day and to-morrow has still richer and deeper things to
   tell us from God. He need not be a repetition of yester day, he need
   not be a repeater of old saws and counsels, carrying precisely the same
   lamp. Still, to-day as ever, our prophet speaks from God, and in the
   utterance of these more privileged times we ought to behold a
   brightness far more radiant than the current standard, far more
   exacting in its demands--an inspiration leading us nearer to that
   glorious consummation when we shall know even as we are known.

   Arid lastly, how shall we receive a prophet and understand his message
   when he comes? Here is the guiding word: "No prophecy of Scripture is
   of private interpretation." [ Verse 20] We are not at liberty to take
   our own roads to the interpretation. Private ways of that sort will
   never lead to the truth. There is a prescribed highway by which the
   deep secrets of prophets can be gained. A just interpretation of
   prophecy will always depend upon the spirit in which we approach it.
   Thomas à Kempis has a very revealing word in, I believe, the very first
   chapter of that wonderfully helpful book The Imitation of Christ. "By
   what spirit any scripture was made, by that same spirit must it be
   interpreted." If you want to interpret a prophecy aright you must get
   into the spirit in which it was born. You cannot take a private way.
   Only in that way, the way in which it had its birth, can you get its
   secret meaning. I think that is true of literature in general. I was
   reading only the other day a book by one of the ablest literary critics
   of the last fifty years, and lie said lie never understood the drive,
   and spring, and leap of Sir "Walter Scott's Marmion until he declaimed
   it aloud on a galloping horse. But why did the secret of Marmion come
   out when it was declaimed on the back of a galloping horse? Because it
   was composed on the back of a galloping horse. And if you will turn to
   Marmion with this conception of the leap, and spring, and gallop in
   your mind and heart, you will get the very go and drive and rhythm of
   the poem. That will suffice for our purpose. We are to rearrange the
   conditions under which poetry was born if we are to discern and
   interpret its meaning. And so it is with all prophecy and all poetry,
   and all music. What is the use of bringing a commercial instinct to the
   interpretation of Wordsworth? What could you do with it? If you want to
   understand Wordsworth, you must become identified with the man, you
   must become possessed by the Wordsworthian mood. How, then, shall I
   find the secret of Isaiah, of Paul, of Savonarola, or of Luther? Not by
   any private interpretation, but by that same spirit in which their
   message and prophecy were born. Is not this the word of the Master? "He
   that receiveth a prophet in the spirit of a prophet shall receive a
   prophet's reward." He that receiveth Wordsworth in the spirit of
   Wordsworth, will enter into Wordsworth's work. He that receiveth Paul
   in the spirit of Paul will walk in the highways and byways of Paul's
   inheritance. It is no use my going to Paul or to Isaiah with mere
   implements of criticism, however delicate or however refined they may
   be I shall fail to discover the secrets of his intimacy; I shall be
   locked out from his innermost fellowship. We must come to these men
   with reverence, with humility, with sincerity of purpose, with that
   absolute frankness which offers a sensitive surface to all good things.
   To sum it all up, the Holy Spirit must interpret what the Holy Spirit
   first inspired, and it would be far better to have no critical
   apparatus at all, and to know nothing about scholarship and nothing
   about learning, and to come to the sacred page with the shoes from off
   the feet, than to go burdened with all manner of learning and
   scholarship, and tramp loudly and flippantly in the most sacred place.
   You cannot get into secrets by private and heedless ways of that kind.
   It will have to be done in the broad highway of God's Holy Spirit. We
   need the Holy Spirit. And what we need we can get. And if ye, then,
   being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much
   more shall your Father give the holy, interpreting Spirit to them that
   ask it? And so you see we can all be interpreters, and, blessed be God,
   we can all be prophets too! For if we are all filled with the Holy
   Spirit there will come into our message the prophetic significance,
   into our very singing the prophetic fervour, into our ordinary
   intercourse and converse spiritual energy and pith. The Holy Spirit
   will speak through me.


   Oh, teach me, Lord, that I may teach

   The precious things Thou dost impart;

   And wing my words that they may reach

   The hidden depths of many a heart.


   Oh, fill me with Thy fulness, Lord,

   Until my very heart o'erflow

   With kindling thought and glowing word

   Thy love to tell, Thy praise to show.

DESTRUCTIVE HERESIES

  2 Peter ii. 1

   But there arose false prophets also among the people, as among you also
   there shall be false teachers, who shall privily bring in destructive
   heresies, denying even the Master that bought them, bringing upon
   themselves swift destruction.

   THIS is a dark and appalling chapter. There is nothing quite like it
   elsewhere in the entire book. The misery and desolation of it are
   unrelieved. It is so like some wide and soddened moor, in a night of
   cold and drizzling rain, made lurid now and again by lightning-flash
   and weird with the growl of rolling thunder. Everywhere is the black
   and treacherous bog. The moral pollution is over whelming. I confess
   that I have stood before it for months, in the hope of seeing my way
   across, and even now I am by no means confident of a sure-footed
   exposition. The gutter conditions are ubiquitous. The descriptive
   language is intense, violent, terrific. There is no softening of the
   shade from end to end. It begins in the denunciation of "lascivious
   doings"; it continues through "pits of darkness," "lawless deeds,"
   "lust of defilement," "spots and blemishes," "children of cursing"; and
   it ends in the gruesome figure of "the dog turning to his own vomit and
   the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire." It is an awful
   chapter, borrowing its symbolism from "springs without water," and from
   "mists driven by a storm," and recalling the ashes of "Sodom and
   Gomorrah "to enforce the urgency and terror of its judgment.

   Is there any road across this dark and swampy moor? Has the bog a
   secret? To drop my figure, has this wide-spreading pollution an
   explanation? Amid all the cold mystery and darkness of the chapter, one
   thing becomes increasingly clear as we gaze upon it, that the depraved
   life is the creation of perverse thought, that in "destructive
   heresies" is to be found the explanation of this immoral conduct. I say
   this is one of the clear and primary emphases of the apostle's
   teaching. A man's thought determines the moral climate of his life, and
   will settle the question whether his conduct is to be poisonous marsh
   or fertile meadow, fragrant garden or barren sand. The pose of the mind
   determines the dispositions, and will settle whether a man shall soar
   with angels in the heavenlies or wallow with the sow in the mire. What
   we think about the things that are greatest will determine how we do
   the things that are least. "What are your primary thoughts about God?
   The prints of those thoughts will be found in your courtesies, in your
   intercourse, in the common relationships of life, in the government of
   commerce, in the control of the body, and in all the affairs of home
   and market and field. All the corruption of this chapter is traced up
   to unworthy conceptions of Christ, to the partial, if not entire,
   dethronement of "the Lord of life and glory." The immorality has its
   explanation in "destructive heresy."

   "What think ye of Christ?" In what was their thought defective? What
   was the essence of the heresy? The secret is here, they had no adequate
   sense of His holiness. All true and efficient thinking about God begins
   in the conception of His holiness. If you begin with His love, you
   deoxygenate the very affection you proclaim. If you begin with His
   mercy, you deprive it of the very salt which makes it a minister of
   healing and defence. If you begin with His condescension, it is a
   condescension emasculated, because you have not gazed upon His lofty
   and sublime abode. You cannot get a glimpse of the unspeakable humility
   of Calvary until your eyes are filled with the glory of the great white
   throne. If you would know the depth you must begin with the height! Our
   thinking concerning the Lord must not take its rise in His compassions
   or His love. We must begin with the pure white ray. We must begin with
   the great white throne! When the man Isaiah was refashioned for the
   prophetic life, it was not some softened glimpse of a wistful family
   circle in glory which absorbed his gaze. It was the vision of a throne,
   "high and lifted up." And those who stood about the throne were not
   moving in light and familiar liberty. "Each one had six wings; with
   twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet." How
   solemn, and how reverent, and how worshipful! And the voices which he
   heard were not the jaunty songs and liltings which are sung at the
   fireside. "And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is
   the Lord of hosts." It was in circumstances like these, and upon
   heights like these, that the prophet's thinking began! Do not think
   that grave and venerable experiences of this kind make life severe and
   hard and rob it of its juice and freedom. There is no man who has more
   to say about the throne and the awful splendours that gather about it,
   no man who tells us more about the thunders and lightnings that proceed
   out of it, than just the apostle who has given us the most exquisitely
   tender letter in the New Testament Scriptures. John Calvin is a name
   that has become almost synonymous with hardness, unbendableness,
   severity, with high and austere contemplation, but you do the man a
   grave injustice and you miss the interpretative secret of his life if
   you ignore or overlook the wells of most delicate compassion in which
   his life and writings abound. Our softest water is the water that flows
   over granitic beds. If you would know what it made of Isaiah, read
   through his message and examine his life. The rivers of tenderness and
   compassion which flow in this book are not anywhere to be surpassed
   except by "the river of water of life" which "flows from the throne of
   God and of the Lamb." When you have read the sixth chapter of Isaiah,
   when you have tremblingly gazed upon the throne, "high and lifted up,"
   when you have looked upon the veiled and stooping seraphim, and when
   you have listened to the solemn sound of holy voices "chanting by the
   crystal sea," then turn to the fortieth chapter, and hear the sound of
   running waters, the rivers of compassion "Comfort ye, comfort ye my
   people, saith the Lord. Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto
   her that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned.
   . . . He shall feed His flock like a shepherd!" The soft compassion of
   the fortieth chapter finds its explanation in the solemn severities of
   the sixth. I stood by a Swiss chalet, on the lower slopes of a lovely
   vale, and by the house there flowed a gladsome river, full and
   forceful, laughing and dancing in its liberty, and instinctively I
   prayed that my life might be as the river, full of power and full of
   song, clearing obstacles with a nimble leap, and hastening on to the
   great and eternal sea. And to my voice less prayer there came reply,
   "Follow up the stream to its birth!" And I tracked the buoyant river,
   and I reached the snow-line, and I found that in the spreading wastes
   of virgin-snow the singing minister had its birth. And then I knew that
   full and forceful Christian lives must have their source in sovereign
   holiness, that only above the snow-line, near the great white throne,
   could they find an adequate birth. "Hast thou forsaken the snows of
   Lebanon?" That is the "destructive heresy," to begin one's thinking and
   one's doing otherwhere than in the holiness of God. To begin elsewhere
   is to be sure of impoverishment, and to have a life-river which will
   lose itself in unwholesome swamp and bog, and become the parent of
   moral corruption and contagion. "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of
   hosts."

   But let me still further analyse this "destructive heresy." If we do
   not begin with the Lord's holiness, we can have no discernment of the
   Lord's atonement. Dwell below the snowline, and you want no atonement!
   And for this reason. The man who does not begin his thinking in divine
   holiness will have no keen and poignant perception of human sin. "What
   you see in a thing depends very much upon its background. John Ruskin
   has shown us how the whitest notepaper, exposed before the tribunal of
   bright sunshine, reveals its inherent grey. It all depends upon the
   back ground. If your background be gas-light, your notepaper will
   appear superlatively white; but if the background be the all-revealing
   flame of God's resplendent sun, the apparent white will darken into
   grey. I have seen a sea-gull in flight, with a black cloud for a
   background, and the bird seemed white as driven snow; I have seen the
   same bird upon the water, with a back ground of snowy foam, and the
   wings were grey. Yes, what is your background? If you do not begin with
   the holiness of God you will never see the blackness of sin. If your
   back ground be some indifferent human standard, some halting
   expediency, some easy policy, human life, and your own included, will
   appear passably clear. I think I am no pessimist, but I confess I look
   with some alarm at what I cannot but regard as the lessening sense of
   sin which seems to hold our modern thought and life. One's fears are
   difficult to express because the dark symptoms themselves are so
   difficult to disengage and define. But I feel a certain dulness, a
   certain drowsiness, in the spiritual life. I feel a certain close,
   enervating mugginess in the moral atmosphere; a want of alertness, of
   sharp and sensitive response. Our modern Churches are too indolently
   contented, too prematurely satisfied, and are much too willing to take
   easy advantage of the compromises offered of the world. We must become
   suspicious of an indulgent terminology. A violent antagonist of the
   Christian faith, a man whose method of attack is of the slap-dash kind,
   declared, only a few days ago, "There is no such thing as sin; there is
   only error." The man who begins with that diagnosis can never prescribe
   for me. But we must see to it that we do not take advantage of this
   indulgent term, and the Christian pulpit must proclaim the holiness of
   the Lord, and allow no web of wordy sophistry to hide the great white
   throne! We have frequently been told that we need to recover the word
   "grace"; we need first to recover the word "holiness"; holiness will
   recover the word sin. And if sin does not appear sin, but passes muster
   as imperfect virtue, wherein comes the need of atonement? No holiness,
   no sin; no sin, no Saviour! Redemption is a superfluity, and the
   ministry of Jesus is a wasteful toil, and His passion is a fruitless
   death. The man who has no vision of holiness has no perception of the
   Atonement, and he "denies the Lord that bought him." It is the man who
   has ascended above the snow-line, who will wail in his secret soul,
   "Woe is me, for I am unclean," and who will smite upon his breast,
   saying, "God be merciful to me a sinner!"

   Well, now, see the consequence of these things. I have been trying to
   expound the "destructive heresy "which I think is the initial cause of
   the pollution which is so terribly unfolded in this chapter. If these
   cardinal conceptions are dull or eclipsed, other precious things will
   be destroyed. Cast your eyes over this widespread corruption. There are
   some "conspicuous absences." There are many missing treasures, whose
   absence accounts for the filth. I miss the instinct of reverence! They
   tremble not "to rail at dignities." It is an ill thing in a life when a
   man has no sovereignty before which he bows in reverent awe. Take out
   the august, and life is reduced to flippancy, and levity is the master
   of the feast both day and night. A man who never reveres will find it
   impossible to be true. The man who never kneels in spirit can scarcely
   be upright in life. To bow to nothing is to be master of nothing. If we
   have no sense of the august to worship, we shall have little sense of
   sin to expel.

   I know that in using this word "august" I am using and borrowing a
   characteristic expression of my great predecessor Dr. Dale, and I hope
   I am using it with something of his own reach and loftiness of thought.
   I do not know anything which is more needed in our Free Church life and
   worship than an awed and reverent consciousness of God. I could wish
   that we moved about our very sanctuaries with a softer step, and that
   our very demeanour was that of men who are held in a subdued wonder at
   the majestic presence of God. I sometimes think that our very
   detachment from any prescribed order of service, our boundless freedom,
   our familiarity with the Lord, our easy intimacy in communion, need to
   be guarded from besetting perils. Even when we rejoice in the Gospel of
   Calvary let us "give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness."


   Before Jehovah's awful throne

   Ye nations bow with sacred joy.

   I do not think we are in danger of "railing at dignities," but I do
   think we are in danger of forgetting the supreme dignity of them. In
   one of his letters to Matthew Mowat, Samuel Rutherford uses these
   words: "Ye should give [God] all His own court-styles, His high and
   heaven-names." I think we are a little lacking in the court-style, in
   this use of the high and heaven-names. But the use of the high names
   will come back when our souls are humbly gazing upon the high things.
   "When we shall see Him as John the Evangelist saw Him, we, too, "shall
   fall at His feet as one dead." Our souls will always have the stoop of
   reverent adoration while we keep in view the vision of the holiness of
   our Lord. In all this revelling, sweltering chapter I miss the sense of
   sin.

   And amid all the movements I miss another treasure, the sense of a
   large and noble free dom. I know there is a talk of freedom, but
   freedom is not enjoyed. "Promising them liberty," and the poor fools
   are deluded into the thought that they are in possession of it. I know
   they are "doing just as they like," but of all forms of bondage that is
   the worst; for this great world, and the laws of its government, are
   not built upon the "likes "of men, but upon the rights and prerogatives
   of God. How can a man be free, even though the song of freedom be ever
   on his lips, if all the powers in grace and nature are pledged to
   overthrow him? I tell you every flower of the field is ranked against
   defilement, and all the forces of this wonderful planet are arrayed
   against the man whose only arbiter is his own "likes," instead of being
   determined by the arbitrament of the will and purpose of God. A man who
   is in sin, and assumes he is in liberty, and is satisfied with his
   position, has not risen to the contentment and liberty which are the
   glory of humankind, but is sunk to the animal bondage of the sow, which
   gloats and wallows in the mire.

   There are other missing treasures which I might name, but I will
   content myself in mentioning only one the absence of any perception of
   the drift and purpose of history. When the great things go out of life,
   when the sublime is exiled, when reverence dies and the days decline in
   triviality, men lose their sense of history, and yesterday has no
   voice. "And I heard a voice behind me, saying!" That is the voice of
   yesterday, and it is the privilege of those who are in the fellowship
   of God to know its interpretation. Sodom and Gomorrah shout through the
   centuries, and so do Nineveh and Babylon, and Greece and Rome! "If God
   spared not the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a
   preacher of righteousness, when He brought a flood upon the ungodly";
   and if God turned "the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into
   ashes. . ."--that is the voice of history, the shoutings of experience,
   and by the people in this chapter the voice is unheeded because
   unheard. All these "conspicuous absences"--the instinct of reverence,
   the feeling of sin, the sense of a noble freedom, and the recognition
   of historical witness--are accounted for by perverse thinking, by
   "destructive heresies," by the degradation of the Godhead, by the
   eclipse of the great white throne. Having no sense of holiness, they
   "denied the Lord that bought them." The lack of lofty summit explains
   the corrupt and stagnant plain.

   Now this particular species of heresy may not be prevalent to-day. I do
   not know that we could find its precise lineaments in our own time. But
   we may give the teaching wide dominion. Our primary conception of the
   Lord will determine the trend and quality of our own life, and the
   depth or shallowness of its ministry. Whatever dethrones or disparages
   Christ will impair and impoverish man. Anything that cheapens the
   Saviour will make us worthless. Any teaching which puts Him out of
   account, which removes Him from the front place, which relegates Him to
   the rear, which in any way "denies" Him, is a "destructive heresy," and
   is fraught with peril and destruction. Is there any modern peril?

   There is a prevalent teaching to-day which is usually known as the "New
   Thought." I do not speak as its antagonist, but as one who wishes to
   preserve it from becoming a minister of weakness and destruction. I
   welcome much of its teaching. I believe that in discovering and
   clarifying psychological laws it may render unspeakable help to the
   living of a Christian life. I believe that we are now standing upon the
   borderland of a marvellous country, and that mystic forces are to be
   revealed to us of which hitherto we have only dimly dreamed. I believe
   that the marvellous phenomena of telepathy and hypnotism, and all the
   discoveries we are making in this dim and impalpable world, may
   mightily help us in the fortification of pure and resolute habit. But I
   see a danger, an ominous danger, a danger real and immediate. I know
   the literature of this new teaching, the literature both of this
   country and of the United States; I speak from first hand knowledge,
   and I say that the teaching gives no adequate place and sovereignty to
   Jesus Christ our Lord. He is of little or no account; lie is
   occasionally mentioned, but only as one of a crowd, and He is not
   accorded that unique and solitary pre-eminence which He claims. In one
   of the latest, and in some respects the ablest, of these books I have
   looked in vain from end to end for even the bare mention of the
   Saviour's name. He does not count! He is a negligible and therefore
   neglected factor, and is left entirely out of the reckoning. And
   because He is absent, other things are missing. I find no mention of
   guilt. Rarely do I stumble upon the fact of sin. In the "New Thought"
   there is no confession of sin, no sob of penitence, no plea for
   forgiveness, no leaning upon mercy. The atonement is an obsolete
   device, the pardonable expedient of a primitive day. "A man must
   acquire the art," says one of the best of these teachers, "the art of
   allowing the past, with whatever errors, sins, faults, follies, or
   ignorances entangled, to slip out of sight." How easy the suggestion,
   how tremendous the achievement! For the most of us that burden slips
   away only where the pilgrim's burden rolled away, at the foot of the
   Saviour's cross, where it rolls into the Saviour's grave. I care not
   what veins of helpful ministry these men and women may strike, if they
   ignore the Saviour and the ministry of redeeming grace, they are
   dealing with essentially surface forces as compared with the mighty
   powers born of personal communion with Him. It is a teaching which
   practically "denies the Lord that bought us," and so far it is a
   "destructive heresy" which offers no adequate ministry for the
   liberation of sinful men, and for the attainment of a full and matured
   life. All thinking is initially wrong which does not begin with the
   unique holiness of the Lord, and which does not reserve for Him a
   supreme and sovereign place in man's redemption. And that, too, is the
   severest indictment of spiritualism. It has little or nothing to do
   with the Lord. It concerns itself with meaner folk, with smaller
   themes, and with trivial communion. Who ever heard of a spiritualistic
   campaign for the reclamation of the lost? That's where its sense is
   dull. "Saviour!" That's where the vision is dim. We must bring all
   teachings, and all ministries to the touchstone of our exalted Lord and
   Saviour. What do they do with Him? What think they of Christ? We must
   suspect any thing and everything which lays Him under eclipse. Do they
   deny the Lord that bought us? Do they dim His glory, and rank Him in
   the indiscriminate crowd? Then we must label them as "destructive
   heresies," whose forces can never achieve the redemption of human kind.

   What, then, shall we pray for ourselves and for others? First of all we
   will pray that we may never lose sight of the heights of the Divine
   holiness! We are told that they, who dwell beneath great domes, acquire
   a certain loftiness and stateliness of bearing which distinguishes them
   from their fellows. Let us pray that about our brethren and ourselves
   there may be a mystic significance, a breadth and height of character,
   a nobility of life, telling of the sublime abode in which we dwell. May
   we dwell in the truth, live and move in the truth, and by no perilous
   emphasis of minor themes and things deny the Lord that bought us.

WORSE THAN THE FIRST

  2 Peter ii. 20, 21

   For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through
   the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again
   entangled therein and overcome, the last state is become worse with
   them than the first. For it were better for them not to have known the
   way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn lack from the
   holy commandment delivered unto them.

   "The last state is become worse with them than the first." [Verse 20]
   Apostasy is worse than ignorance! It were better for us never to have
   come within sight of the Kingdom, and to have remained in ignorance of
   its privileges and glory, than, having entered the gate, to become
   rebels to its sovereignty, and to turn our backs upon its contemplated
   ministries of grace. To approach the Divine is an unspeakable favour;
   it is also an appalling responsibility. Light that is trifled with
   becomes lightning; the splendour of the great white throne becomes a
   "consuming fire." To have known, and then to rebel, translates our very
   knowledge into a minister of destruction. The abuse of the highest
   degrades us beneath the lowest. "The first shall be last." "The last is
   become worse with them than the first." "Lilies that fester smell far
   worse than weeds." Here, in the apostle's words, we have depicted for
   us the rise and fall of a soul. There is the realisation of moral
   deliverance: "they have escaped the defilements of the world through
   the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ." [Verse 20] There
   is the subsequent moral relapse: "they are again entangled therein and
   overcome." And there is the consequent deterioration in the moral and
   spiritual capital of the life: "the last state is become worse with
   them than the first."

   The realisation of moral deliverance. "They have escaped the
   defilements of the world." What is this "defilement" of the world in
   which these souls have been imprisoned? Who can define it? "Who can lay
   hold of this subtle and varying corruption, and give it an
   interpretative name? Its metamorphoses are extraordinary. It has a
   hundred different guises, changing its attire continually, but amid all
   its shifting appearances it remains essentially the same. You have the
   same essential elements in solid ice, in flowing water, in hissing
   steam, in wreathing vapour, in moving cloud. In all the multiplex forms
   you have the same essence: the reality abides; it is only a change of
   attire. You can have the same poison in varying preparations, mingling
   with different compounds, appearing in diverse colours, and confined
   within dissimilar flasks. The incidentals are many, the poisonous
   essence is one and the same. And so it is with this "corruption" of the
   world; it pervades different sets of circumstances; it enshrines itself
   in different compositions, but everywhere and anywhere it is the same
   destructive minister. It is the same in Whitechapel and Belgravia, in
   the House of Commons and on a racecourse, in the King's palace and the
   peasant's hut, in the Church and on the Exchange. You may have "the
   defilements of the world" palpable and gross, and you may have them
   tenuous and refined. They may be rank and offensive as "the lust of the
   flesh"; they may be rare and vain and elusive as "the pride of life."
   Yes, many forms, but one spirit! "The fashion of this world passeth
   away." The "fashion" changes; the thing itself abides.

   "The defilements of the world." Every age seems to have its own
   characteristic corruption, its own destructive, worldly form and
   colour. When St. Anthony went out into the Egyptian desert as a protest
   and safeguard against the corruption of his time, it was a different
   form of worldliness to that which encountered St. Benedict in a
   succeeding century, and which drove him to found his great Monastic
   Order; and the worldliness against which St. Benedict contended
   differed from the corruption which surrounded St. Francis when, at a
   later day, he established the Order of the Mendicant Friars. All these
   forms of monasticism fought the same essential corruption, but it
   appeared here in the shape of a decaying individualism, and there in
   the shape of social and political dissolution, and yonder in the shape
   of a proud and luxurious Church. "The fashion of this world passeth
   away." How different is the worldliness which forced the Salvation Army
   into existence from the worldliness which prevailed at the time of the
   evangelical revival! John Wesley and General Booth looked out upon
   quite different conditions, but the difference was only in the shape of
   the flask and the colour of the compound; the essential adversary was
   the same. The corruption of our own day wears a different guise from
   the corruption of twenty-five years ago. It has transferred itself to
   other spheres, and has pervaded new sets of relationships, and you have
   to look for it in new attire. The fashion changes; the pollution
   abides! Behind all the shiftings of the centuries the defilement
   persists, and it manifests itself in a mode of thinking, a mode of
   working, and a mode of living which is essentially anti-Christian. It
   is the anti-Christian drift in the life of a generation which
   constitutes its pollution, and such drift may be found with equal
   certainty in Mayfair and the Seven Dials. It is a subtle spirit, now
   enshrining itself in an individual, now in a society, now in a
   Parliament, now in literature, now in art, now in the acquisition of
   treasure, now in the apportioning of leisure, in a hundred different
   vestures, but remaining always the anti-Christian drift, and ever
   degrading its victims into Christian negations.

   Now this "defilement of the world" is an infection, and propagates
   itself like a foul contagion. It is a significant and suggestive thing
   that the word which our version translates by "defilements" is our
   English word "miasma." It is the suggestion of the process by which the
   corruption works. "The miasma of the world!" And what is a miasma?
   Medical science has a synonym for the word which gives us much
   enlightenment. "Aerial poison!" A miasma is an aerial poison, an
   emanation or effluvia rising from the ground and floating in the air.
   "The miasma of the world." It is pervasive as an aerial poison, it
   distributes itself like a destructive contagion. Let an unclean miasma,
   some foul immorality, infest one lad in a public school, and the school
   will seek its own security by his immediate expulsion. One polluted lad
   can infect a thousand. "The miasma of the world." We know the workings
   of the principle in social clubs. It is amazing how soon the miasma can
   pollute a society. It has happened before: now that one man has
   degraded a social fellowship, and has created a malaria which pure men
   have refused to breathe. What has happened in smaller communities has
   also prevailed in civic fellowships and in the larger life of the
   State. "Evil communications corrupt good manners." Sometimes we can
   withdraw ourselves from an evil contagion, and our withdrawal may tend
   to destroy it by neglect. But we cannot altogether get away from "the
   miasma of the world." We are in the world, and the air is infected, and
   we have got to breathe it. How then?

   There is a way of escape. "They have escaped the miasma of the world."
   We can be rendered immune, as medical science can make us immune in the
   presence of some particular contagion. "I pray not that Thou shouldest
   take them out of the world," but that Thou shouldest make them
   immune--"that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil." Regard it or
   disregard it as we may, this is the claim of the real Christian
   science, the promise of the Gospel of Christ: "If they drink any deadly
   thing it shall not hurt them." It is possible for a man to move amid
   the prevailing miasma of his day, to live and move and have his being
   in its very presence, and yet to remain in robust moral health. Now,
   mark you, this moral deliverance is attained through a spiritual
   fellowship. "They have escaped the defilements of the world through the
   knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ." [ Verse 20] An escape
   from the miasma by the "knowledge" of a Person! But that word
   "knowledge" implies infinitely more than mental conception. It is the
   "knowledge" which implies acquaintance, intimacy, communion, community.
   I should not be doing violence to the meaning of my text if I were to
   read it in this wise: "They have escaped the miasma of the world
   through the partnership of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ." It is a
   "knowledge" which implies a league, a covenant, a "partaking of the
   Divine nature"; and through this marvellous union there flows into
   human-kind a river of regenerating energy, reinforcing our miserable
   weakness, and endowing us with all the resistances of invincible
   health. Our Lord makes us immune to the miasma of the world by
   communicating to us His own victorious virtue, and by making us
   sublimely positive to all the assaults and negations of the devil. "He
   restoreth my soul." "Thou shalt not be afraid of the pestilence that
   walketh in darkness." "I will fear no ill." Such is the way of escape.

   But now the apostle unfolds a dark sequence. The moral deliverance may
   be followed by a moral relapse. "They are again entangled therein and
   overcome." [Verse 20] Need I say that this immoral alliance is
   occasioned by the breaking of the spiritual alliance? Our spiritual
   attachment endows us with a powerful antidote and antagonism to the
   miasma of the world. Relax the attachment and you weaken the antidote.
   Sever your spiritual communion and you impoverish your moral defence.
   It is a sequence which is illustrated every day in multitudes of lives.
   Maintain your alliance with the Lord, and you are secure in a health
   which keeps your enemy at the gate. Let your alliance become loose, and
   your moral repulsion grows faint. I offer no argument to prove it; the
   proof is found in common experience. "Demas hath forsaken me, having
   loved this present evil world." Yes, but before Demas had forsaken
   Paul, he had broken with the Lord, and then he swung back in mighty
   drift towards the world. When he had wilfully rejected the help of the
   heavenly energy, he succumbed to the gravitation of the world. He was
   no longer immune, and the miasma subdued him in the common defilement.
   How suggestive are the words in which the apostle describes the
   relapse: "They are again entangled." [Verse 20] They begin to move
   towards the world, and presently they become involved. It is a figure
   of this kind: they go too near the destructive machinery; they go in a
   prying curiosity, and they are caught by a sleeve, and are undone!
   "They are again entangled." Ah, it is by our loosenesses that we are
   caught and involved! When we leave our Lord our thought becomes loose,
   we exercise too much freedom of thinking; and some loose end becomes
   entangled, and we are "overcome." When we leave our Lord our speech
   becomes loose; we say what we like and not what we ought; and some
   loose phrase gets entangled and we are "overcome." When we leave our
   Lord our affections become loose; deserting the great Lover we flirt
   with the world: "I will go after my lovers." We become "lovers of
   pleasure more than lovers of God," and we are speedily involved and
   undone. Immediately we begin to weaken our alliance with the Lord we
   begin to re-establish our communion with the world. The
   re-establishment of the immoral alliance may begin in apparently
   trifling flirtations, but it speedily issues in a dark enslavement.
   When you wish to moor a big boat to a pier, you first throw across the
   intervening gulf a light line. Gulliver's bondage in Lilliput began in
   the binding down of a single hair! And our light flirtations with the
   defiled world, the yielding of a hair here and a hair there to its
   playful caress, will lead to an eventual entanglement which will make
   the soul the bond-slave of pollution. To trifle with the world is to
   play with the plague. "They are again entangled and overcome."

   And what is the moral status of the back slider? "The last state is
   become worse with them than the first." [Verse 20] Here is a man who
   has had intimacy with the Lord. By the strength of the holy partnership
   he has been kept inviolate, and "no plague has come nigh his dwelling."
   He dissolves the partnership; he opens up a lost communion; he turns
   like "a dog to his vomit," and "a sow to the mire," and the appalling
   issue is this, that "it were better had he never known the way of
   righteousness," and the last state of the man is worse than the first!
   How is he worse? In spiritual apprehension. His sense of God is
   tremendously abused, and he has not the same receptive organ to the
   Divine that he had when first he sought the Lord. He has not the same
   appreciation of grace, the same craving for forgiveness, the same
   hunger for holiness, the same longing for home! How is he worse? In
   moral discrimination. His moral palate is not as sensitive as when lie
   first surrendered his life to the King. His mouth is harder! He can
   swallow iniquity neat. How is he worse? In the poverty of his emotional
   force. The fundamental energies of the life are sluggish or dead, the
   love-force, the hope-force, the faith-force, the ultimate momenta which
   constitute the wealth and dignity of man. How is he worse? Because he
   does not know he is worse! "Thou sayest I am rich, and have gotten
   riches, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art the
   wretched one and miserable and poor and blind and naked!" "The last
   state of that man is worse than the first."

   Can such a man be recovered? Oh yes! Backsliders may be converted and
   recovered. "He is able to save unto the uttermost!" "I will recover
   thee of thy backsliding." "All things are possible to him that
   believeth."


   Though earth and hell the word gainsay,

   The word of God can never fail:

   The Lamb shall take my sins away,

   'Tis certain, though impossible:

   The thing impossible shall be,

   All things are possible to me.


   All things are possible to God,

   To Christ, the power of God in man,

   To men, when I am all renewed,

   When I in Christ am formed again,

   And when, from all sin set free,

   All things are possible to me.

THE LEISURELINESS OF GOD.

  2 Peter iii. 3, 4, 8, 9.

   Mockers shall come with mockery, walking after their own lusts, and
   saying, Where is the promise of His presence? . . . One day is with the
   Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is
   not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness; but is
   longsuffering to you-ward, not wishing that any should perish, but that
   all should come to repentance.

   "Where is the promise of His presence?" [Verse 4] Where are the signs
   of the King's presence and ministry? Where are the prints of His
   goings? Show us the proofs of His interposition, the evidences of His
   revolutionary and transforming work! Reveal to us the witness of His
   handiwork, or at any rate let us see and touch the hem of His garment!"
   Where is the promise of His presence? "It is the uproarious cry of the
   mockers, "walking after their own lusts." [Verse 3] They are
   proclaiming the heedlessness of the Almighty; "The Lord God is not
   moving, with attentive ministry, along the ways of men! He is far away,
   in the boundless hunting-ground of space, engaged with larger prey!"

   "Where is the promise of His presence?" It is not only the shout of the
   scoffer, it is the low, poignant cry of the devout. The voices in this
   Book are many and manifold. You can hear the loud, laughing jeer of the
   mocker, rising in the very midst of prophecy and psalm: and you can
   hear the wail of the perplexed, like a low, long moan of pain. "How
   long wilt Thou forget me, Lord?" "Lord, how long wilt Thou look on?"
   "How long, Lord, how long?" The defiant and reckless scorn, and the
   agonising doubt, concern themselves with one thing--the apparent
   heedlessness of God.

   What, then, is the problem? It is this. Men are confronted with an
   apparently undiscriminating and uncompassionating juggernaut. No hand
   seems to be busy in human affairs engaged in just and discerning
   judgment. There is no selection determined by moral worth. The vast
   movement is blind and capricious. The gigantic machine staggers along,
   like some untended traction engine, and its huge, grinding wheels
   bruise and break all things into a common mass, stones and little
   children, the wasteful and the useful, the sinner and the saint.

   Let me read to you a short passage from one of the most delicate and
   sensitive of our present-day writers, who thus expresses a part of this
   sharp and burdensome problem: "Last summer, as I walked in my garden, I
   heard a fledgeling sparrow chirruping merrily under a bush. Possibly he
   had by accident dropped out of his nest, and, by making parachutes of
   his wings, had so broken his fall as to reach ground without taking
   hurt, and was now in a flutter, between pride and fear, at his own
   daring. For a few minutes I watched him ruffling it as roguishly as a
   robin, now cocking his glossy head at a sprawling worm, now stropping
   his tiny beak, razor-wise, upon a twig, and twittering lustily
   meanwhile for very joy of his freedom and of his merry youth and of the
   summer morning. . . . I insinuated myself into my hammock, and with my
   ringers between the pages of a book, lay a-swing in the sunshine as in
   the centre of a golden globe. For a time I forgot both book and bird.
   Then suddenly my golden globe shattered into darkness at a sound--a
   mere thimbleful of sound--a scream of terror and agony, so tiny and yet
   so haunting and so horrible, that I seem to hear it even now. A tame
   rook that has the run of my garden had pinned the sparrow, breast
   upward, under his talons, and, as I looked, was stabbing the life out
   of him with iron beak. For that wee bird no happy warbling among the
   leaves: no happier rearing of his young. . . . The sight of that
   helpless nestling, done to death in the June sunshine, and by one of
   his feathered kin, turned me sick and faint with horror." "Where is the
   promise of His presence?"

   I had just written these words when an urgent letter was placed upon my
   desk. I paused in my work to open and read it, and this sentence gave
   its crimson hue to deepen the colour of my page: "We have had another
   physician to see her, and he pronounces the disease to be cancer." The
   victim is an incarnate angel, who has moved along the hard roads of
   life with all the sweetening and reviving ministry of a perfume. Her
   life has been a daily death; she has acquired only that she might give
   again, she has spent herself in order that by the energy of sacrificial
   blood others might be made alive. And now, cancer! "We have had another
   physician to see her, and he pronounces the disease to be cancer." That
   cancer should have come to her! "Where is the promise of His presence?"

   The same morning I had read these words in my daily paper: "The 6th
   Company of the 23rd Siberian Regiment reached the summit, and rushed in
   the Japanese defences. They were, however, received with fixed
   bayonets, the captain being lifted into the air by several Japanese on
   the points of their weapons. The rest of the company all perished
   before the companies following could get up. This is the tenth day such
   a butchery has been going on. The Turkish War was a joke to this! Over
   all this vast field of action, an area of thirty miles, the ground is
   strewn with the dead, and tens of thousands of human wrecks are being
   carried south and north from this unexampled battlefield." Let that
   gory record add its quota to the already deeply dyed and troubled page.
   "Where is the promise of His presence?"

   And that is not all. The difficulty is accentuated when one turns from
   the victims to some of those who apparently escape. Notoriously bad men
   are housed in comfort, and useless women are clothed in silks and
   satins, and walk the sunny side of the way. Dishonesty sweeps by in the
   carriage, while integrity creeps foot sore by the kerb. "Fools ride on
   horseback, while princes walk by their side." The sleep of the beast is
   untroubled, while the saint moans through the night in pain. The
   contrasts are apparently appalling, and fortune does not favour the
   brave! "Where is the promise of His presence?"

   What shall we say to these things? Let us say, first of all, that we
   are very ignorant, that our eyes are only endowed with short range, and
   that our knowledge has severe and almost immediate limitations. Do not
   let us regard our uncertain guessings as final judgments. Let us admit
   the mystery, and cease our bitter dogmatisms until the mist has rolled
   away. How little we know! That little fledgling, done to death by the
   rook, how little we know about him! The dropping from the nest, his
   little chirp, his material equipment, the scream and . . . we know no
   more! "If God saw fit," says our literary friend, "to set that little
   creature singing in the green groves of Paradise (and who dare say that
   God has no place in His universe for the sparrow, that God Himself has
   told us is evermore within His care!), if God saw fit, at the cost of a
   moment's pain, to take His bird--where danger shall menace never more,
   what is that to you?" Our range of vision is ineffective, and we
   haven't the evidence to justify a harsh and bitter verdict.

   My cancer-stricken friend, how little I know about her! And sometimes
   in my thinking I do not include all the little I know. I called her
   "victim"; the strange thing is that she would never use the word about
   herself, and her thoughts about herself are part of the case. I refuse
   to allow any verdict upon her which takes no account of her peace, and
   resignation, and deep and unsmitten faith. I can hold no parley with
   judges who keep their eyes glued upon the corroding disease, and pay no
   regard to her long and radiant vista of immortal hope. I say that the
   "victim's" assurance is part of the problem, and must not be ignored in
   the verdict.

   The fact of the matter is, our thoughts are moving upon an altogether
   inadequate scale. That is the teaching of this chapter to troubled and
   doubt-stricken men. "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and
   a thousand years as one day." [Verse 8] We are not thinking on a
   sufficiently adequate scale: our thoughts cannot wrap themselves about
   the entirety of the place. We know what ministry an enlarged scale
   accomplishes even for some of the smaller things which lie in the term
   of human years. A thing looked at in the scale of one day is quite a
   different matter when set in the scale of seventy years. The scale of
   one day obscures purpose and tendency, and veils "the far-off interest
   of tears." I lately read some extracts from a printed diary, and I
   would like to read you a part of them. The first is from the diary of a
   boy, and I will give it just as it appears. [1] "I cannot pretend to
   like this school, however much I try. The head is a beast, and not one
   of the under masters is a decent chap. I hate being kept in after hours
   when the other fellows are going out to games, yet, whenever I haven t
   done a lesson right they make me do it until I know it thoroughly. This
   is constantly the case with my Latin. Also I do loathe the food they
   give us; we have to eat fat and lean together, and fat is beastly.
   Also, however cold it is, we have to take long runs when it would be
   much nicer to sit by the fire and be comfortable. Also I can't
   understand my father and mother, who say they love me and all that,
   sending me to such a place."

   Just fifty years later the same hand wrote these words, when the
   writer's name was known throughout the world. "Of my many advantages in
   early life, I place easily first my parents, whose particular method of
   training me was beyond all praise. . . . In looking back upon my first
   school, I can think of it only with affection, for the manner in which
   the masters treated |my inert tendency of character was entirely
   admirable. To their insistence at that period I owe one of the keenest
   delights of my maturer years, a love for the Latin authors. . . . In
   the matter of physical soundness, also, I am certainly much indebted to
   the school runs, which were compulsory, and to the wholesome and
   sensible diet on which we were fed, without which I should not possess
   to-day the virility which has kept me free from disease to a quite
   unusual extent." Need I point the moral of the contrasts? The boy's
   entry enshrines a verdict fashioned upon the scale of a day: the man's
   entry declares a judgment fashioned to the scale of fifty years. It is
   all a matter of scale!" One day is with the Lord as a thousand years,
   and a thousand years as one day." In things of the day He has in view
   the thousand years; the thousand years being the full maturing of the
   designs that moulded the little day. "Where is the promise of His
   presence?" Think upon the scale of a thousand years.

   But in the chapter before us the mocker's scorn primarily concerns the
   heedlessness of God in the face of human sin. They are happy and
   untroubled in their lust! The jeer is this, that God is heedless of sin
   or virtue, and that there are no signs of discriminating judgment
   between the open sinner and the professed saint. Is God heedless about
   sin? "Where is the promise of His presence?" Are there any signs of His
   whereabouts? Let us ask ourselves this searching question--how do
   things trend? Is God heedless concerning sin? To what tribunal can we
   make our appeal? We can appeal to the testimony of the purest
   instincts. We can appeal to the witness of personal experience. We can
   appeal to the proclamation of the Christian Scriptures. And what is
   their united teaching? It is this that there is nothing more sure than
   "the everlasting burnings." I do not refer to some remote and unseen
   hell, the appointed destiny of an impenitent race. I refer to a present
   conflagration, the everlasting burning, in which the sinner is even now
   being inevitably consumed. I say that instinct and experience agree in
   this, that sin has to encounter an unavoidable Nemesis, and that wrong
   moves on to certain destruction. Our proverbial lore, the findings and
   expressions of the common life, gives emphatic utterance to the same
   truth. "A man's chickens come home to roost." "The whirligig of time
   brings round its revenges." "Sin doesn't pay in the long run." What the
   proverb declares, our experiences confirm. There is not a single sinner
   in this town to-day who is not, even now, in "the devouring fire," "the
   everlasting burnings." You say that some of them seem very happy in the
   fire! Yes, they do, but don't you see that their happiness is not a
   disproof, but the very proof of the conflagration. Degradation is
   penalty. Loss of fine perception is penalty. The destruction of the
   coronal powers is penalty. Is it no sign of horrible judgment that a
   man is satisfied with the pleasures of the kitchen, when the oratory of
   his life is ablaze? This is the plane of true and cogent reasoning;
   manhood maimed is manhood penalised. That men are contented to be as
   pigs in the mire is the clearest evidence that their crowns and
   dignities have been burnt away. In the early stages of their sin men
   are conscious of their loss, and they busy themselves in fashioning
   counterfeits. They employ divers kinds of religious cosmetics. They
   strive and strive to "keep up appearances" even when the internal
   treasure is destroyed! My God! no judgment in the world? No Nemesis? No
   fire? Is not this a most awful judgment, more awful than any other,
   that when the very virtues of a man are consumed away, he should move
   about in self-satisfaction, wearing a hollow and painted pretence? You
   want to see visible lightning appear and strike him! Our God uses the
   ministry of a more secret consumption. "Our God is a consuming fire."

   As it is with individuals so it is with peoples. Judgment haunts the
   footsteps of the sinful state. We can trace the decline and fall of
   Rome. We can track it step by step through increased idleness, through
   demoralising employment, through heated sensuality, through the decline
   of agricultural pursuits, through the lapse of military virtue, on
   through all to Imperial perdition. There are grave and sober-minded men
   who are beginning to think that Nemesis is revealing a visible hand in
   the Russia of to-day. As for Britain, let her remember that, whatever
   adhesion may be found in material and commercial communion, it is not
   in these things that she will find the cement of an enduring and
   indestructible empire. "Righteousness alone exalteth a nation." In men
   and in peoples we may be sure that our sin will find us out. All sin
   works towards decline, insipidity, impotence, and night. Of all sad
   spectacles, the saddest is the spectacle of the candle smouldering out
   in an ill-spent life! "Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy
   youth, ere the evil days come," the insipid, burnt-out days, "when thou
   shalt say, I have no pleasure in them."

   And yet, after all, God does appear leisurely. Why does He not hasten
   His goings? Why are not sin and perdition more closely joined? Why does
   He move at such a leisurely pace? Why is He so slack? Listen. "The Lord
   is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness; but is
   longsuffering to you-ward, not wishing that any should perish, but that
   all should come to repentance." [Verse 9] "Not slack, as some count
   slackness," not impotent, not indifferent, not unwilling to perform.
   What then? "But is longsuffering toward you." It is the leisureliness,
   not of heedlessness, but of mercy. Our God is "slow to wrath"; it is a
   slow fire, slow in order that we may have opportunity to repent. God's
   judgment on sin could have been appallingly swift and final. He might
   have ordained that one revolt should incur the paralysis of the will
   and the ruin of the life. And what would have been the effect? That we
   should have moved in a trembling terror, and though we might have been
   virtuous we should never have been free. The lowest motive would have
   operated in the soul, and the lowest motive can never produce the
   highest life. Some graces would never have ripened; we might have been
   pure, we could never have been genial and sweet. And so our Lord is
   apparently "slack"; He is "slow to wrath"; and by the very slowness He
   gives to us a gracious opportunity for reflection, a chance for the
   awaking of the affections, and room for the ministry of repentance. The
   far-off psalmist had discerned the secret of the Lord when he said:
   "Therefore will the Lord wait that He may be gracious unto you." "The
   Lord is not slack . . . as some count slackness; but is longsuffering
   to you-ward, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should
   come to repentance." Let us give thanks at the remembrance of God's
   leisureliness!


   How have I Thy Spirit grieved

   Since first with me He strove,

   Obstinately disbelieved,

   And trampled on Thy love!

   I have sinned against the light;

   I have broke from Thy embrace,

   No, I would not, when I might

   Be freely saved by grace.


   After all that I have done

   To drive Thee from my heart!

   Still Thou wilt not leave Thine own,

   Thou wilt not yet depart.

   Wilt not give the sinner o'er;

   Ready art Thou now to save,

   Bidst me come, as heretofore,

   That I Thy life may have.

PREPARING FOR THE JUDGMENT

  2 Peter iii. 10-14

   But the day of the Lord will come as a thief; in the which the heavens
   shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall be dissolved
   with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are therein shall
   be burned up. Seeing that these things are thus all to be dissolved,
   what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy living and godliness,
   looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God, by
   reason of which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the
   elements shall melt with fervent heat? But, according to His promise,
   we look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth
   righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for these
   things, give diligence that ye may be found in peace, without spot and
   blameless in His sight.

   "Seeing that ye look for these things." [Verse 14] What things? Let us
   glance back at the descriptive record of the outlook. "The day of the
   Lord will come as a thief; in the which the heavens shall pass away
   with a great noise, and the elements shall be dissolved with fervent
   heat, and the earth and the works that are therein shall be burned up."
   [Verse 10] Here is an apostle vividly anticipating an awful day of
   judgment. In that final judgment righteousness is to be triumphantly
   vindicated, and iniquity is to be irrevocably overwhelmed. The coming
   of the day is sure; the time of its dawning is uncertain. It will
   assuredly come, but it will come as a thief! The affairs of all men are
   moving forward to consummation and crisis. There are details in the
   apostle's out look, the mere drapery of the expectation, which I do not
   profess to understand, and which I shall make no attempt to explain.
   But altogether apart from the mysterious vestures in which the judgment
   is clothed, there are three outstanding characteristics of this
   stupendous crisis in the history of the soul. The anticipated judgment
   is to be a time of dissolution. "The heavens shall pass away with a
   great noise, and the elements shall be dissolved with a fervent heat,
   and the earth and the works that are therein shall be burned up." With
   the material details in this description I am not now concerned. It is
   sufficient for me to receive this cardinal impression: that the
   judgment is to be a season of convulsion, of upheaval, of exposure of
   foundations, of the dissolution and exhibition of the component parts
   of things. In that day it is to be revealed of what elementary
   substance things and characters are made. And, secondly, the
   anticipated judgment is to be a time of discrimination. This out
   standing event is to mark not merely a culmination, but a crisis.
   Things are to be analysed and tested, and judged by the pattern in the
   mount, and there is to be a separation of part from part, of character
   from character, of the healthy from the corrupt. "The wicked not stand
   in the judgment.." And, thirdly it is to be a time of transformation.
   Out of the dissolution and discrimination is to arise a changed world.
   "According to His promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth,
   wherein dwelleth righteousness." [Verse 13] Out of the crisis is to be
   born a new morning, with new light and new atmosphere, and a new home,
   and a new spirit pervading all things. Such are the pre-eminent
   characteristics of this overwhelming event in which every earthly life
   is to culminate in the judgment presence of God.

   And now with this foreground of severe and sanctified expectancy, the
   apostle proclaims the following challenge: "Seeing that these things
   are thus all to be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be?"
   [Verse 11] How ought men to live in the face of a hereafter and a sure
   and awe-inspiring judgment? With that towering possibility confronting
   us, which to the apostle was a great and solemn certainty, with what
   kind of ambition ought we to direct and control our days? Let us mark
   the coolness and sanity the apostle's reply. For there is nothing
   heated in his speech, nothing feverish, nothing sensational and
   fanatical. He does not tremble in paralysing fear; he does not maim his
   life by ascetical severities. Looking upon this superlative event, his
   life is cool and calm, full-toned and healthy. "Seeing that ye look for
   these things, give diligence that ye may be found in peace, with out
   spot and blameless in His sight." [Verse 14] That is not counsel for
   men in their decrepitude, when their evening time is come, and their
   sun is in the west, and the shout and struggle are over, and the fight
   and feast are done; it is counsel for life in its morning and its
   pride, counsel which seeks the creation of a rich and consecrated
   character, full-blooded and effective all along the changing way. If
   there be a judgment, as there will be, if there be a morrow of crisis,
   as there surely will, then in these robes we may meet it with eager and
   fearless face; "In peace, without spot and blameless in His sight."

   Now let us look a little more closely at those features of the
   character which will stand triumphant in the judgment. "Found in
   peace." [Verse 14] Let us once again rid ourselves of the common
   interpretation of peace. In the ordinary mind peace is synonymous with
   quietness and rest. We are walking up Ludgate Hill at noon, and we are
   jostled by the hurrying and perspiring crowd, and we turn from the
   hurrying multitudes into the cool quietness of St. Paul's Cathedral,
   and we are tempted to say to ourselves, How peaceful it is! Or we go
   into some little village church, hoary with the passage of many years,
   and with no sound disturbing the stillness except the occasional song
   of a bird which steals tenderly through the open window, and again we
   use the pregnant word, How peaceful! Or we go into the chamber of the
   dead, and we look at the body with the wrinkles wiped out, and the
   once-while weary limbs lying in undisturbed rest, and again we say, How
   peaceful it is! But these are not the symbols of Christian peace,
   however pertinently they may express the secret of stillness. Peace is
   not stillness, but a certain kind of movement. It is movement without
   friction: cog works into cog with perfect and noiseless harmony:
   everything moves without jar, and there is no grit in the wheels. Peace
   is not the absence of noise, but the absence of discord. "When we dig
   away to the very roots of the word we find its primary content is
   "perfect joining." Nothing works out of its place. Everything moves in
   every thing else with delightful confluence. And this is peace, and
   therefore peace is harmony; it is the absence of the rebel, the
   extinction of strife. And so if there is to be peace in my life, all
   the powers in my life must co-operate without friction and move in
   harmony under the supreme control of the sovereign will of God. Here is
   a musical instrument, the organ. It is a very complex instrument,
   containing I know not how many hundred parts. And there is a movement
   in the organ known as ciphering. And what is ciphering? It is the
   sounding of an organ-pipe, in consequence of some derangement or
   maladjustment, independently of the action of the player. Harmony is
   dependent upon the obedience of each note to the organist's authority.
   If any note breaks out of its own accord, the harmony is broken, and we
   are the victims of jarring discord. Now every man's individuality is
   like a complex organ. How manifold and varied are the component parts!
   And the harmony of the individual is dependent upon the co-operation of
   all his powers. And yet how frequently the harmony of the life is
   broken by the ciphering of a part! Some faculty is rebellious, and
   breaks away from the control of the will. How often the player upon the
   instrument has to confess, "I cannot control my temper!" or, "I cannot
   control my imagination!" or, "I cannot control my passions!" But there
   is this distinction between ourselves and the musical instrument. The
   organist at the keyboard has no control over the ciphering; it is
   independent of him, and works entirely away from his resources and his
   will. But the individual has resources at his disposal, offered to him
   by his Lord, resources found in the dynamics of grace, by which every
   faculty can be subjected to the holy purpose of our Lord. It is
   possible for the individual to be "found in peace," and for "all that
   is within me" to bless God's holy name.

   Let us investigate a little more in detail this manifold organ of the
   individual self. There are my powers of body. These are to be "found in
   peace." They are to work in harmony with one another, and under the
   control of the sovereign will of God, and they are to move as common
   subjects of the King. "Present your bodies." We must bring our basal
   energies to the Lord, and have these bodily forces subdued to the
   higher harmonies, like the profound notes of the organ that give body
   and fulness to its tender and sweetening strains. "Let the ape and
   tiger die," sings Tennyson. But there is a better way. And the better
   way is to transform them. I do not want my passions annihilating; I
   want them turning to useful force. I want the sword changed into a
   ploughshare, and the spear into a pruning-hook, and I want the beast at
   the base harnessed to the imperial and holy purpose of God. If a man
   consecrates "the ape and tiger" to the Lord, and these are brought into
   obedience under the Lord's control, the life will receive a tremendous
   driving-power, and every holy ambition will be pursued with almost
   violent zest. "I keep my body under," says the Apostle Paul. "I allow
   no ciphering!" Every bodily desire is held in the leash, and all work
   together, and are "found in peace."

   There are my powers of mind. We speak of wandering thoughts, thoughts
   that are rebellious to the general dominion, and that steal away to
   forbidden fields. "We have unrestrained imaginations, fancies that go
   off on their own charges and ask no question concerning the lands in
   which they roam. "Bring every thought into captivity to Christ." It is
   possible for all our mental powers to be "found in peace." We have more
   power over our thoughts than we frequently conceive. There is much
   reserve of authority which has not yet been exercised. We can refuse a
   thought expression, and that refusal enormously strengthens our
   self-control. "Give no unproportioned thought its act." Make every
   thought bow down to Jesus before you give it utterance! But if we still
   find that our sovereignty is ineffective we can refer our weakness to
   the Spirit. We can take these rebel thoughts and imaginings, and we can
   say to the Holy Spirit, "These thoughts, my great Companion, are beyond
   me! I have no power to deal with them! I hand them over to thee!" And
   marvellous is the efficacy of the reference! Marvellous is the
   re-arranging of this disordered world, and the subjection of the mental
   chaos into harmony and peace.

   And there are my powers of soul. There are the superlative senses in my
   life. These also must be "found in peace." Our sense of right must not
   be allowed to join the rebel forces of mere expediency. Our sense of
   the sublime must not be permitted to career after degrading
   superstitions. Our highest powers must pay obeisance in the holy place,
   and acknowledge in awed communion the holiness of the Lord. All this is
   peace, for this is harmony, the powers of body and of mind and of soul
   all co-operating in producing the music of the spheres, the melody
   which is well-pleasing unto God. And this is the character with which
   one can confidently meet the day of judgment. "Give diligence that ye
   may be found in peace."

   Now turn to the second of the characteristics of the triumphant life:
   "found . . . without spot." [Verse 14] Let us mark the significance of
   the word. It describes a life distressed by no infirmity and corrupted
   by no disease. It is neither lame nor denied. Our God desires the
   entire life, and He resents a defective offering. He wants "a lamb
   without spot." None of our powers are to be made infirm by disease, and
   none are to be rendered diseased by abuse. Is not this a sane and
   reasonable teaching? Surely this man's mind is in no degree impaired by
   the spectacle of coming judgment! His ambition is to be diligent--to
   present himself healthy, with every part of his being in working order.
   We may vary in the quality of our endowments, but there need be no
   variety in their purity. One man may have ten talents, and another man
   only one, but in both instances the life can be perfectly clean. One
   man's endowment may be as that of a cathedral organ, while another may
   be common place as an ordinary harmonium, but both can be kept in
   perfect purity, no part corrupted, and every part sounding out the
   obedient note.

   And the third characteristic of the triumphant character is described
   in the succeeding phrase, "without blame." [Verse 14] Is that possible?
   I may get my body under, and I may succeed, by the grace of God, in
   freeing every part of my being from infirmity and disease, but is it
   within the bounds of possibility that I can stand in the judgment
   "without blame"? I think of my life. I retrace its steps. I mark its
   deliberate rebellions, its sins of selfishness and desire, its
   injustices in speech and deed, its disloyalties and secret treacheries.
   How can such a life ever be found "without blame"? And yet it is
   gloriously possible. It is the .very evangel of grace that, on the day
   of judgment, men whose lives were once defiled can stand before the
   Almighty, and no word of blame or rebuke shall fall upon their ears.
   They shall come to judgment, but there shall be no condemnation. "There
   is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus." I
   saw a man a little while ago with the marks of his old rebellion still
   seated in his face; but behind that disfigured countenance there was
   the illuminating presence of the light of life, and that man shall
   stand in the judgment "without blame." But this can only be possible
   when the life is lost "in Christ." We are regarded and judged as being
   in Him. What He is we are, for as He is we shall one day assuredly
   become. "Our life is hid with Christ." It may be only poor as yet, and
   the footprints of the beast may be scarcely erased from our life, but
   one day we are to be manifested in His beauty. It fills me with
   amazement that I, once a vagrant, and bearing about with me signs of my
   degeneracy, shall one day "walk in His likeness." Yes, and those old
   days, those pitiably blighted days, are never to be named by Him in
   whose holy presence we are all to stand. "I will remember them against
   thee no more for ever."


   Rock of Ages, cleft for me,

   Let me hide myself in Thee.

   Here, then, is a great ambition--that on the awful day of unveiling we
   may thus be "found in peace, without spot, and blameless." And see with
   what intensity this apostolic ambition is to be pursued. The apostle
   uses three very strenuous figures of speech. "Be diligent." [Verse 14]
   It is again the favourite image of the business man. We are to pursue
   the riches of this finished character with all the ardour of an expert
   man of affairs. We are to be inventive and earnest and prompt, buying
   up every opportunity for moral and spiritual enrichment. "Beware!"
   [Verse 17] And secondly we are to have all the vigilance of a
   custodian. Having got a pearl, I am to guard it as one of the crown
   jewels. "Hold fast that which thou hast; let no man take thy crown."
   And thirdly, we are to "be stedfast." We are to manifest the
   unshakeable and unshrinkable loyalty of a soldier at the post of duty.
   In seeking this glorified character we are to stand faithful at our
   post, "and having done all, to stand." Go forward to the judgment,
   seeking peace and spotlessness and blamelessness with all the diligence
   of a business man, with all the vigilance of a watchman, and with all
   the daring obedience of a soldier on the field of battle.

   A life like that, hiding in Christ and always cherishing the Father's
   business, need fear nothing that the morrow may bring. For that kind of
   life the judgment will have no terrors. If we live toward God we shall
   not fear to see Him. Nay, here is the apostle bold enough to use these
   very daring and exuberant words, "earnestly desiring the coming of that
   day." It is the very music of this Epistle. "That day!" "At that day!"
   I say it is music to the apostle, as indeed it was music to the Apostle
   Paul, who gloried in "the crown of righteousness which the Lord, the
   righteous Judge, shall give me at that day, and not unto me only, but
   unto all them also that love His appearing."

GROWING IN GRACE

  2 Peter iii. 18

   Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

   IF these words, and indeed the nature and contents of all this
   wonderful chapter, were not penned by Simon Peter, they were composed
   by his "double" in the spirit. Their hearts are fashioned alike. The
   writer of this counsel has had Simon Peter's experience, and he is
   possessed by Simon Peter's penitence, and he shares Simon Peter's
   trembling confidence and hope. If some firmly authenticated and
   altogether non-suspicious letter of the great apostle were to fall into
   my hands, this is the kind of matter, and this the manner, which I
   should expect in its intense and impetuous pages. I should expect much
   about pitfalls and snares, much about finely attired and specious
   seductions, much about secret treachery, cowardly denial, and open
   revolt. I should expect strong and jubilant evangels, proclaiming the
   capacity of frail and fragile man to become the loyal and bosom friend
   of God Almighty. I should expect glorious vistas of distant
   possibility, bright and alluring, the ultimate bourn of human life in
   fellowship with the Divine. All these I should expect from the hands
   and lips and heart of this great apostle--once impulsive, and cowardly,
   and disloyal, but now recovered, emboldened, glorified in the
   recreating power of the Holy Ghost. And they are all here, messages
   full of heartening, serious with warning, kindling with inspiration,
   and all of them culminating in this cheery word of sanctified Christian
   optimism, "Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour
   Jesus Christ." Yes, it is Simon Peter, or his "double," the man who had
   the two-fold experience of weeping bitterly in the cold twilight of the
   betrayal morning, and of gazing, with hungry, loving eagerness into the
   reconciled countenance of the risen Lord.

   Well, here in my text there is suggested a marvellous dignity, the
   supreme prerogative and endowment of human-kind, our capacity to
   receive the Divine. "Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and
   Saviour Jesus Christ." Let us humanise it. To grow in a thing implies
   that I have the power to acquire it. Acquisition implies
   susceptibility, power of reception. When a man counsels me to grow, he
   suggests that I am in possession of a germinal aptitude, in the
   development of which the growth consists. "Grow in Art, and in the
   knowledge of the Masters of Art!" Such counsel implies that I possess
   initial artistic instincts, a certain elementary sensitiveness, which
   will respond to the revelations of each succeeding stage in the
   unfolding apocalypse of form and colour. If I am to grow in the grace
   and knowledge of Turner I must fundamentally possess the primal
   instincts of which the ultimate Turner is made. Growth implies a germ,
   an initial bias or tendency, an original aptitude or gift. And if I am
   to "grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ," the consoling and
   inspiring suggestion is this, that I am not passive and ungifted like a
   splint from a planet, or a mineral in the mine, but that to me has been
   given an original capability, an innate possibility of holding commerce
   with the infinite God. We are fragments of Divinity!

   Here then, I start with this glorious and marvellous implication, that
   the children of men have the power to apprehend and to growingly
   appropriate the "things" of the Spirit of God. Let us look at the
   capacity. "Grow in grace" We have the capacity to receive the Divine
   energy, to receive it more and more; to so grow in the appropriation of
   it that we are at last "filled with the fulness of God." For Grace is
   an energy; it is the Divine energy; it is the energy of the Divine
   affection rolling abundantly to the shores of human need. Oh, it is
   this, and much more than this! Its manifold wealth eludes the span of
   human speed, and refuses to be defined. Grace is indefinable. Dr. Dale,
   with his strong hands and yet most exquisite touch, endeavoured to
   express its secret in a pregnant phrase, but he laid down his pen in
   despair. "Grace," he says, "is love which passes beyond all claims to
   love. It is love which, after fulfilling the obligations imposed by
   law, has an unexhausted wealth of kindness." Yes, it is all that; but
   when we have said all that, the half hath not been told. It reminds me
   of an experience in my life a little while ago. Some minister of the
   Cross, toiling in great loneliness, among a scattered and primitive
   people, and on the very fringe of dark primeval forests, sent me a
   little sample of his vast and wealthy environment. He sent it in an
   envelope. It was a bright and gaily-coloured wing of a native bird. The
   colour and life of trackless leagues sampled within the confines of an
   envelope! And when we have made a compact little phrase to enshrine the
   secret of grace, I feel that, however fair and radiant it may be, we
   have only got a wing of a native bird, and bewildering stretches of
   wealth are untouched and unrevealed. No, we cannot define it. Who can
   define an Alp? We may describe the varying aspects of a mountain, some
   of its ever-changing moods; we can add feature to feature,
   characteristic to characteristic, but we can never say that we have
   exhausted the significance of its wealthy face. And so it is with
   grace. We may have glimpses of its features and varying moods. Even
   when we can not construe its ultimate secret, we may describe when we
   cannot define. Now that is just what the New Testament permits us to
   do. It gives us a glimpse here, and a glimpse there, and we can put bit
   to bit, feat Lire to feature, until we are overwhelmed with the glory
   of the revelation of God's redeeming grace! Let us put them together.
   Grace is energy. Grace is love-energy. Grace is a redeeming
   love-energy. Grace is a redeeming love-energy ministering to the
   unlovely, and endowing the unlovely with its own loveliness. Wherever I
   see grace at work in the Christian Scriptures it is ever a minister of
   purity, and joy, and song and peace. Cast your eyes over these! "Where
   sin abounded, grace did much more abound." Like as you have seen the
   shore littered with filth and refuse, and the infinite deep has rolled
   in, and gathered up the uncleanness into its own purifying flood! "We
   have good hope through grace." Like as the light in the lighthouse
   burns clear and steadily through the night, because of the unfailing
   and carefully administered supplies of oil, so the light of a cheery
   optimism burns strong and calmly in the night of life, because of the
   unfailing supplies of grace! "Singing with grace in your hearts unto
   the Lord." Didn't I say that grace is the mother of song? Grace makes a
   light and nimble atmosphere; the soul becomes buoyant, and breaks into
   music as instinctively as the bird sings in the soft airs of the dawn.
   All this is the work of the love-energy of the Eternal God, and the
   evangel is this, that to you and me is given the capacity to receive
   it, to grow in it, to appropriate it more and more, to more and more
   become its home. "He giveth grace for grace," until every tissue and
   function in body, mind, and soul are saturated and sanctified in its
   redeeming ministry. "Grow in grace!"

   "And in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ." Then we
   have not only capacity to receive the Divine energy, but capacity to
   perceive the Divine character. Gifts of reception are succeeded by
   gifts of perception. We are to "grow in knowledge" too. I heard a great
   Bible student say the other day--he is a man of most delicate spiritual
   insight, and has worked and walked with his Lord for many years--and he
   was speaking among a few familiar friends, and he said, "I feel as if I
   have only investigated a small garden-bed, and there's a continent
   still before me!" Have we not all shared his feelings? Is there a
   minister worth his salt who, as his experience broadens and deepens,
   does not realise that he has only touched the hem of his Master's
   garment, and that the more glorious intimacy is all before him? Yes, so
   far as the Lord Jesus is concerned we have all pottered about a little
   garden-bed, with a continent awaiting us. But do not let us be
   despondent or afraid. We must not measure ourselves by the size of the
   garden-bed, but by the possibilities of the continent. We are not
   scaled to the size of the garden-bed; we are scaled and endowed to the
   ultimate demands of the continent. "Now I know in part, but then shall
   I know even as also I am known!" The continent is to be as familiar to
   us as the garden-bed. We can "grow . . . in the knowledge of our Lord
   and Saviour Jesus Christ." Does not that sound continental, that great,
   all-comprehensive name--Lord--Saviour--Jesus--Christ? Into the secrets,
   the deep, bright mysteries of that most wonderful name we are to enter,
   little by little, and we are to apprehend and appreciate things which
   have been "hidden from the foundations of the world." Our capacity may
   at present be infantile, but infantile capacity is real, and the
   undeveloped germ carries in its heart the promise and power of its own
   prime. Caliban may be dark and imprisoned in contrast with the
   enlightened and appreciative Paul, but Caliban is a Paul in embryo, and
   even Paul himself, while he walked the ways of time, had but the
   comprehension of a babe in comparison with many a poor peasant who had
   "left his native lea" and had awakened amid the unveiled secrets of the
   Eternal day. Yes, we can grow; it is our dignity and our privilege to
   grow; we can grow "in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
   Christ." "Now are we the sons of God," aye, even now! And to what shall
   we grow? "It doth not yet appear what we shall be." What then? "We know
   that when He shall appear we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as
   He is." For what superlative glories we are made! Let us even now wear
   our crowns as kings and queens.

   How, then, can we increase our capacity for God? How may we best "grow
   in grace and knowledge," in the two-fold gifts of reception and
   perception? I only know three ways; but I think they are all-inclusive,
   and they would bring a man at length into "the measure of the fulness
   of the stature of Christ." You will not be surprised when I mention, as
   the first means of growth, the ministry of fervent prayer. That is an
   old counsel, almost threadbare by incessant reiteration, but we can no
   more ignore it than we can ignore the fresh air when we are reckoning
   up the conditions of physical health. When I speak of prayer I am
   thinking of a very active and businesslike thing. I think of something
   far more than speech; it is commerce with the Infinite. It is the
   sending out of aspiration, like the ascending angels in the patriarch's
   dream; it is the reception of inspiration, like the descending angels
   that brought to the weary pilgrim the life and light of God. When we
   pray, we must drink in, and drink deeply, quietly, consciously,
   deliberately, the very love-energy of the Eternal God. Marvellous is
   the ministry of that inspired and inspiring grace! Shall I tell you how
   I heard one man speak of another man a little while ago? The one of
   whom he spake had appeared weary and worn, and dark, tired lines were
   pencilled here and there upon his face. And this weary man knelt and
   prayed! "And," said my friend, "when he rose from his knees, I saw for
   the first time the significance of Pentecost! The weariness had gone!
   The dark care-lines were wiped out! His face was all aglow with a
   renewed flame! And I verily believe that if my own heart had been pure
   enough I should have seen a radiant nimbus enveloping his exalted
   head!" What had the weary man been doing on his knees? He had been
   growing in grace, and therefore in the knowledge of his Lord and
   Saviour Jesus Christ.

   And the second means of growth is found in the ministry of honourable
   and consecrated labour. If we could not "grow in grace and knowledge of
   our Lord Jesus Christ" while we earn our daily bread, life would be
   very largely a dark and fruitless waste. But if the hours of labour
   afford a congenial season for spiritual growth, then life presents a
   vast and glorious opportunity. It was while the Man of Nazareth was yet
   working at the carpenter's bench that we are told "He increased in
   wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man." "In favour"--our
   very present word "grace": the love-energy of the Eternal streamed into
   His soul while He engaged in the lowly toil of a humble village
   craftsman. The business of the little day was so done that at the same
   time it was commerce with the Infinite! Every business transaction was
   so scrupulously pure and honourable as to afford a dwelling-place for
   the Holy Spirit of the Eternal God! While He earned His daily bread He
   was drawing into His hungry heart the very bread of life. He and His
   Father were inseparable partners in the making of a household chair, or
   in the fashioning of a yoke for the ox of the field. Was not that, too,
   the restful boast of Stradivari?


   This is my fame--

   When any master holds,

   'Twixt chin and hand a violin of mine,

   He will be glad that Stradivari lived,

   Made violins, and made them of the best.

   The masters only know whose work is good:

   They will choose mine: and, while God gives them skill,

   I give them instruments to play upon,

   God choosing me to help Him.

   The man who goes out to his labour in the morning in that spirit, must
   and will grow in grace and knowledge, and he will find that the common
   path of duty is even now "close upon the shining tableland to which our
   God Himself is sun and moon."

   And the third means of growth is to be found in the ministry of
   unselfish service. In the sphere of the spirit, expenditure is ever the
   condition of expansion. We get while we give. We grow while we serve.
   "He that would be great among you let him be your minister." "He giveth
   grace to the humble." Aye, it is along that path that we come upon the
   crown jewels of the King of Kings. "He that loseth his life shall find
   it." The man who goes out to serve his brother shall meet his God, and
   shall be partially transfigured into the Saviour's likeness: he shall
   pass into ever richer acquisitions of grace, and he shall be taken into
   the deeper secrets of his Lord.
