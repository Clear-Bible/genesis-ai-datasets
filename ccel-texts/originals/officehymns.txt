PREFACE

   The renderings contained in this volume are chosen from a quantity of
   material, much of which had to be set aside as, for various reasons,
   unsuitable. But, as can be understood, in process of reading, thoughts
   linked themselves to the memory, and echoes of music, much of it
   surpassingly sweet, lingered, and from those echoes and thoughts the
   Centos and Suggestions have been formed. The phrases containing the
   thoughts, and the echoes repeating the music, have been woven together
   to form the fabric which is shewn here.

   This volume is presented because the author believes that the hymnody
   of the West must find much of its finest enrichment in the praise
   literature of the Church of the East. It would be presumptuous to think
   that these renderings and suggestions are at all a worthy expression of
   the noble and richly varied praise of the Eastern Church; but they
   constitute, together with those contained in two former volumes by the
   present author, perhaps one-half of all the pieces which have yet
   appeared in English verse.

   All the renderings in this collection appear for the first time. If any
   one thinks he has reason to complain of their quality, let him try to
   do better. The field lies untilled for any one who will work it.

   Euchologion, p. 35

   8,6,8,6


   I

   O destitute of all defence,

   We bow before Thee now;

   In mercy let Thy mercy come,

   For merciful art Thou.


   II

   Our trusting souls in quiet repose

   Would rest Thy love within;--

   O be not angry with us, Lord,

   Nor think upon our sin.


   III

   But from Thy high abode look down,

   With tender love the while,

   And save us from our foes who would

   Our wayward hearts beguile.


   IV

   For, verily Thou art our God,

   And we Thy people all;--

   Hear us, the creatures of Thy hand,

   When on Thy name we call.


   V

   To God the Father, God the Son,

   All praise and glory be;

   And to the Spirit, Three in One,

   To all eternity.

   I

   Within Thy courts my praise shall rise,

   O Saviour of the world, to Thee;

   And while I bow, will lift mine eyes,

   Unconquered Might, Thy face to see;

   At eve, at morn, at noon, alway,

   All blessing Lord, to Thee I'll pay.


   II

   Here in Thy courts, O Lord, we bow,

   And soul and body worship give;

   Hear us, Thy faithful servants now,

   Eternal God in Whom we live;

   And Thou the Unbeginning Son,

   And Holy Spirit Three in One.

   I

   Why do we fade?

   Who Thine own image bear,

   Who life immortal share,--

   Why do we fade?


   II

   Why did we err?

   And leave the food of life,

   To eat the bread of strife,--

   Why did we err?


   III

   Why thus deceived?

   And robbed of life divine,

   That precious gift of Thine?

   Why thus deceived?

   John the Monk

   6,6,6,6,6,6


   I

   All human things decay,

   For all is vanity,

   The silver and the gold;

   The glory of the great,

   The wealth of high estate,

   None can for ever hold.


   II

   Death with his icy hand,

   Severs each earthly band,

   And bears us all away;

   Vain are our earthly dreams,

   Shadows our substance seems,

   And nothing lasts for aye.


   III

   Immortal Christ, we cry,

   O let our prayers come nigh

   Thy throne of heavenly grace;

   Rest him whose form we miss,

   Grant him in endless bliss

   A lasting dwelling place.

   6,6,6,6,8,8


   I

   Thou, Lord, hast power to heal,

   And Thou wilt quickly aid,

   For Thou dost deeply feel

   The stripes upon us laid:--

   Thou Who wast wounded by the rod

   Uplifted in the hand of God.


   II

   Send speedy help, we pray,

   To him who ailing lies,

   That from his couch he may

   With thankful heart arise;

   Through Her, whose prayers availing find

   Thine ear, O Lover of mankind.


   III

   Oh, blinded are our eyes,

   And all are held in night;

   But like the blind who cries,

   We cry to Thee for light;

   In penitence, O Christ, we pray,

   Give us the radiant light of day.

Ode V. of Metrophanes

   (From the Midnight Service for the Sabbath)

   e ton proton ton Angelon amesos diakosmon
   Parakletike, p. 4

   Metrophanes

   7,6,8,6


   I

   The radiance of the brightness

   Of beauty shed by Thee,

   Descend on us who hymn Thy name,

   Sole ruling Trinity.


   II

   Victorious nature hymns Thee,

   Thou orb of triple ray;

   For Thou hast hallowed it through grace

   And borne its sin away.


   III

   In faith we laud the Father,

   The Spirit and the Son,

   One Nature, One Divinity,

   One God, yet Three in One.


   IV

   To Thee our God be glory,

   O Holy Trinity,

   Both now, and while the ages run

   To all eternity.

Ode VIII of Metrophanes

   (From the Midnight Service for the Sabbath)

   neumati thourgiko kurie panton
   Parakletike, p. 4

   Metrophanes

   7,6,7,6


   I

   Thy mighty word commanding,

   The heavens were settled high,

   And earth to Thee responding

   Was spread beneath the sky.


   II

   O God of power, Thy servants

   Would seek Thy power divine,

   That they their hearts to love Thee

   May evermore incline.


   III

   And gazing on the glory

   That shines in triple ray,

   Our souls shall feast with gladness

   On Thy sweet light alway.


   IV

   And of Thy glory shining,

   And of Thy ruling light,

   From age to age Thy servants

   Shall hymn both day and night.


   V

   To Thee be lasting praises,

   Immortal Three in One,--

   Thou Father, Son, and Spirit,--

   Now, and while ages run.

   6,6,6,4


   I

   The early dawn awakes,

   The morn triumphant breaks,

   See, see! the brightening sky,

   The Saviour from on high

   Is with us here.


   II

   And we who sat in night,

   Rejoicing see the Light;

   The shadows now are past,

   The Dayspring come at last

   And day is near.


   III

   For we have found the Truth;

   The Son of Virgin youth,

   The Saviour hath been born

   This glorious festal morn,

   And joys appear.

Troparia of The Sixth Hour

   ten achranton Eikona sou proskunoumen agathe
   Horologion, p. 94

   8,6,8,6


   I

   Before Thy Cross we take our place,

   With all our load of guilt,

   And plead forgiveness of Thy grace

   Because Thy blood was spilt.


   II

   For Thou, to free us from our foes,

   Didst bear that cruel Cross,

   And by its agony and woes

   Bring gain for all our loss.


   III

   Therefore we raise with one accord

   Our songs right thankfully,

   For joy and peace, O Christ our Lord,

   We owe in full to Thee.

Ode V

   (From the Canon of the Resurrection)

   ho photisas te ellampsei tes ses parousias Christe
   Parakletike, p. 8

   8,8,8,8


   I

   O Christ, Who art the peerless Light,

   Come with Thy presence ever bright,

   And from the Father's throne above

   Descend to hearts that own Thy love.


   II

   Thy Cross no shame to mortals brings;

   The world with joy its glory sings;

   And men, O Christ, before Thee bow--

   All hail! Thy Resurrection now.


   III

   Ah Thou, our Lord, the Shepherd good,

   Upon that Cross poured forth Thy blood,

   And with Thy last expiring breath

   Didst save Thy flock from endless death.


   IV

   And death of all his power is shorn,

   And men to joy and peace are born,

   For from their sins' oppressive sway

   Forgiveness bears their souls away.


   V

   Glory to Thee, O God, we bring,

   And to the Son, our Heavenly King,

   And to the Holy Ghost always,

   Now, and throughout the endless days.

   I

   All hail, life-bearing Cross,

   The trophy of the good,

   Thy bloom is fragrance on our way,

   Thy fruit our heavenly food.


   II

   Entrance to paradise,

   Strength of all faithful souls;

   The Church's fortress when the foe

   His banner grim unrolls.


   III

   By thee the curse is gone,

   And death no terror brings;

   We cast his power beneath our feet,

   And rise to heavenly things.


   IV

   O shield of our defence,

   And foe of all our foes;

   The glory of the saints of God,

   Their crown for all their woes.


   V

   Who follow Christ the Lord,

   Their beauty find in thee;

   Their harbour of salvation thou,

   Now and eternally.

   6,6,6,6


   I

   Come, mortals, come behold!

   He hangs upon the tree,

   Who made the rolling sea

   The new formed earth uphold.


   II

   See! He is crowned with thorns,

   The King of angels great,

   Who in His high estate

   A glorious crown adorns.


   III

   Derided, see Him wear

   A robe of purple dye,

   Who robes the noon-day sky

   With clouds that float on air.


   IV

   The Bridegroom of the Bride,

   The Son of Virgin born--

   With nails His hands are torn,

   With cruel spear His side.

   I

   O Christ the God, Who art our life,

   Thou from the sealèd tomb didst rise,

   And where Thy sad disciples mourned,

   Appeared to them with glad surprise.


   II

   Because Thy mercy, Lord, is great,

   And all Thy word to them is true,

   Come with its power even as of old,

   And every sinful soul renew.


   III

   All glory to the Father be,

   And to the Saviour, Christ the Son;

   All glory to the Holy Ghost,

   Now, and while endless ages run.

   I

   The Lord ascended into heaven

   That He might from above

   Send down the promised Paraclete

   On mission of His love.


   II

   And there the Father for His Son

   Had decked a glorious throne;

   And clouds, His chariots, bore Him up,

   That He might claim His own.


   III

   O strangest wonder e'er beheld,

   Since ages hoar began,

   The angels saw the highest place

   Given to a Son of Man.


   IV

   "O all ye angels praise the Lord,"

   The Holy Spirit commands,

   "Lift up your gates, ye princes high,

   Ye nations, clap your hands."


   V

   To God the Father throned on high,

   And to the Son be praise,

   And to the Spirit--Three in One,

   From age to age, always.

   I

   Blessed art Thou, O Christ, our God,

   Who to Thy followers gav'st

   The wisdom they have shed abroad

   By which the world Thou sav'st.


   II

   Thou gav'st to them the Holy Ghost

   As Thou hadst promise given,

   When came the day of Pentecost,

   As breath of God from heaven.


   III

   And now by them, Thy faithful few,

   The world Thou gatherest in,--

   As by the net those fishers drew,--

   From all the woes of sin.


   IV

   To Thee, O Father, glory be,

   To Thee, O Christ, the Son,

   And to the Spirit, One in Three,

   While endless ages run.

   O Mystery, hidden from the world

   Through all the ages past--

   Even to the angel hosts unknown--

   Is manifest at last;

   And thou, Theotokos, hast given

   Incarnate God, from highest heaven.


   II

   God in His fulness wears our flesh,

   And from our sin and loss

   Redeemed us by His pain and death

   Upon the awful Cross.

   Save us, through Him who cast away

   The bands of death, we humbly pray.

   Even as thou said'st, O Christ,

   The Holy Spirit came,

   And now our hearts possess

   The knowledge of Thy name.


   II

   For Thou hast richly poured

   Thy Spirit on our race,

   To teach the Father's will,

   And magnify Thy grace.


   III

   Forth from the Father, Thou

   Cam'st to our human needs,

   And from that Source of Life

   The Holy Ghost proceeds.

   Hail, full of grace, Virgin Theotokos,

   Harbour of all who on the billows toss;

   Refuge of those who helpless seek Thy grace,

   Hopeless and sin-stained of our fallen race.


   II

   From thee the Lord Incarnate came to free

   Those who are held in bands of misery.

   Hail! Virgin Mother, for alone thou art

   Blessèd for ever, by each human heart.


   III

   Say to the Christ that strife of sin should cease,

   That to this world should come the bliss of peace.

   Hail! full of grace, Virgin to thee be praise,

   Now and for ever through the endless days.

   6,6,8,6


   I

   Tossed on the sea of life,

   And sick and sore distressed,

   I lift my cry to Thee, O Lord,

   Who giv'st the troubled rest.


   II

   There, where the waters yawn,

   And cruel monsters grin,

   My comrades sink to depths below,

   All in a sea of sin.

   My earnest cry I raise,

   Hear Thou the prayer I make,

   And from the dark abyss of death

   My soul in mercy take.

   I

   At early dawn, with pious thought,

   The holy women spices brought--

   For Christ, their Lord, was dead;--

   But lo! the stone was rolled away:

   "Where are the seals?" they wondering say,

   "The guard, where He was laid?"


   II

   "Why with your ointments mix your tears?

   Why all this sighing, and those fears?"

   An angel near declares:

   "There lies the stone that barred the tomb,

   No longer now its solemn gloom

   Your Lord and Master shares."


   III

   "Haste, haste with joy the tidings tell,

   The Lord hath vanquished death and hell,

   For He, the Death of death,

   Hath burst asunder hades prison,

   And, first-born from the dead hath risen,

   Even as afore He saith."


   IV

   Honour to Thee, O Christ, we bring,

   Thy glorious rising now we sing,

   Victorious is Thy strife;

   Our Hope, our Trust, on Thee we call,

   Our Joy, our Strength, our God, our All,

   And our Immortal Life.

   kai strapheis ho kurios eneblepse to Petro

   8,8,8,8,8,8


   I

   I brought my darkest sin to mind,

   And called it by the vilest name,

   And thought to fill my soul with grief,

   When I had charged it with the blame;--

   I said, "Before my God I'll fall,"

   But sorrow came not at my call.


   II

   I said, "Ah, soul! the wrath of God

   Shall smite the sinner with dismay,

   The record of thy sin is kept,

   And swiftly nears the reckoning day;"--

   Methought I heard God's thunders roll,

   But sorrow came not to my soul.


   III

   "Ah, stony heart! can thought of sin

   In all its vileness bring no tears?

   And canst thou hear God's thunders speak,

   I had no weeping to control,

   For sorrow came not to my soul.


   IV

   I looked, my Saviour looked at me,

   O look of love no heart can bear!

   Like raging torrents came my tears,

   And plunged my spirit in despair;

   Vain, vain my weeping to control,

   For sorrow now hath found my soul.

   The Trisagion, or Cherubic Hymn, has been in use in the worship of the
   Eastern Church from the very earliest. No form of adoration is of such
   frequent occurrence in all the offices of the Church. Originally the
   Trisagion (Thrice Holy), was in the exact form found in Isaiah iv. 3,
   but as the years passed, additions were made to it to express doctrine
   both orthodox and heterodox. The accompanying form is the one found in
   the service books, and is in common use at the present time.

The Trisagion

   i

   Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy upon us.

   Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy upon us.

   Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy upon us.

   Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;

   Both now and ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

   All Holy Trinity, have mercy upon us. O Lord, be gracious unto our
   sins; O Master, forgive our transgressions; O Holy, look down and heal
   our infirmities, for Thy name's sake.

   Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.

   Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;

   Both now and ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

   Our Father which art in heaven: Hallowed be Thy name: Thy Kingdom come:
   Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on the earth: Give us this day our
   bread for support; and forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our
   debtors; And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from the evil
   one;

   Priest. For of Thee is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory, of
   the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, now and ever, and to
   the ages of ages.

   Choir. Amen.

   The Creed of Nicea, which is the Confession of Faith of the Eastern
   Church, was largely formulated at the Council of Nicea, 325 A.D. It was
   based upon the ancient creed of Caesarea, one phrase being added to
   combat the Arian heresy, viz., Consubstantial (homoousion) with the
   Father; and it ended with, And in the Holy Ghost. The concluding
   clauses were added at the Council of Constantinople (381 A.D.). The
   insertion by the Council of Toledo (589 A.D.), of FILIOQUE (and from
   the Son) after from the Father, and its subsequent adoption in the
   West, was made the cause of the separation of Eastern and Western
   Christianity, which has continued from the eleventh century till now.

The Creed of Nicea

   i

   The Confession of Faith of the Eastern Church

   We believe in One God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth,
   of all things visible and invisible.

   And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the only begotten, who
   was begotten of the Father before all the ages. Light of light, very
   God of very God, begotten, not made, consubstantial (humoousion) with
   the Father, by whom all things were made.

   Who for men, and for our salvation, came down from the heavens, and was
   incarnate of the Holy Ghost, and the Virgin Mary, and was made man
   (enanthropesanta).

   And was also crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and
   was buried.

   And rose again the third day, according to the scriptures.

   And ascended into the heavens, and sitteth at the right hand of the
   Father.

   And shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead, and
   of whose kingdom there shall be no end.

   And in the Holy Ghost, the Lord, the Life-Giver, who proceedeth from
   the Father, who with the Father and the Son is together worshipped and
   glorified, who spake by the prophets.

   In One Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.

   We acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins.

   We look for the Resurrection of the dead.

   And the life in the ages to come.

  PRESS NOTICES.

   "Mr. Brownlie has earned for himself the title of hymnologist, and his
   work and research are at this day of great sterling value to all
   engaged in the study or collection of hymns."--Bookman.

   "We have noticed favourably other works from his pen, and a volume
   before us entitled Hymns of the Holy Eastern Church is no less
   deserving of commendation. A long introduction describes
   sympathetically, and even enthusiastically, the doctrine of the Eastern
   Church and its worship, with which Mr. Brownlie is evidently closely
   acquainted."--Church Times.

   "Mr. Brownlie is already favourably known as a translator of hymns from
   the Greek Office-books.... The Introduction is well written, and should
   be of service in dispelling prejudice and ignorance on the subject of
   the Church of the East."--Guardian.

   "Mr. Brownlie has performed a confessedly difficult task.... The best
   part of the book is unquestionably what the author modestly calls an
   Introduction, in which he gives, in the briefest fashion, an entirely
   admirable account of the history, sacraments, and worship of the
   Eastern Church."--Saint Andrew.

   "The author has succeeded in retaining the simplicity of the originals
   while presenting a polished version accommodated to the exigencies of
   rhyme and rhythm.... His plea for a better understanding of East by
   West is well informed, enthusiastic, and persuasive. The Introduction
   is the best compendium we know in small compass of Greek rite and
   doctrine."--Glasgow Herald.

   "Mr. Brownlie is of good repute as a hymnologist, partly through his
   own hymns and translations, and partly through his connection with the
   Church Hymnary, and the companion volume which tells the story of its
   contents.... In a valuable Introduction of nearly seventy pages, he
   tells us of the history, doctrine, and worship of the Church from whose
   service books the hymns have been translated, and his essay is a
   welcome supplement to that which preludes Neale's small collection. Mr.
   Brownlie is a true catholic, and, in helping to catholicise our hymn
   books, he is furthering that unity of spirit which must precede
   ecclesiastical reunion."--Sheffield Daily Telegraph.
