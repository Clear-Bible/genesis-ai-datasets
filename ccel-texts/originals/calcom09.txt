   Psalm 36

   Almost all interpreters agree in supposing, that in this psalm David in
   general expresses his wonder and amazement at the goodness of God,
   because, in the exercise of his favor and mercy, he bears with the
   wicked, who, notwithstanding, basely contemn him. The opinion which I
   have formed is somewhat different. I think that the holy prophet, being
   grievously troubled and harassed by wicked and ungodly men, first
   complains of their depravity, and then seeks refuge in the infinite
   goodness of God, which extends not only to all men in general, but in a
   particular and special manner to his own children; and this he does in
   order to console, and, so to speak, take his breath, in the assurance
   that he shall at length be delivered since God is favorable to him.
   This is evident from the conclusion of the psalm, in which he arms and
   fortifies himself against all the assaults of the ungodly, by
   reflecting that he is safe under the protection of God.

   To the chief musician. A Psalm of David, the servant of Jehovah.

   Why the appellation, the servant of God, is ascribed to David only in
   this place and in the eighteenth psalm, rather than elsewhere, cannot
   positively be ascertained, unless that having been victorious in a
   conflict, of all others the most difficult, he proved himself to be a
   valiant warrior and an invincible champion in the sight of God. We know
   how rare and singular a virtue it is, when ungodliness is prevailing
   without restraint, and when the shade of its obscurity darkens our
   spiritual vision, to look up, notwithstanding, by the eye of faith, to
   the providence of God, which, by disposing our minds to patience, may
   keep us constantly in the fear of God.

   Psalm 36:1-4

   1. Ungodliness saith to the wicked in the midst of my heart, There is
   no fear of God before his eyes. 2. For he flattereth himself in his own
   eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful. [1] 3. The words of
   his mouth are iniquity [2] and deceit; he hath left off to understand
   that he may do good. 4. He meditates [or devises] iniquity upon his
   bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; and abhorreth not
   evil.


   1. Ungodliness saith to the wicked in the midst of my heart
   Commentators are not agreed as to the interpretation of the first
   verse. Literally it is, The saying [or speech] of transgression, or
   rather, Transgression saith to the wicked As, however, the letter l,
   lamed, is in Hebrew sometimes used for mn, min, some translate it thus,
   Ungodliness or transgression speaketh of the wicked in my heart; as if
   the prophet had said, I clearly perceive from the wickedness which the
   ungodly commit, that they are not influenced by the fear of God. But as
   there is no need to depart from the proper signification of the words,
   I rather agree with others in supposing that the language of the
   prophet is to this effect: The malice of the wicked, though seemingly
   hidden and unknown, speaks aloud in my heart, and I am a sure witness
   of what it says or suggests.

   And, first, it is to be observed, that the prophet speaks not of
   outward faults, but penetrates even to the very source; as if he had
   said, Although the wicked cloak their malice with wily dissimulation,
   yet I know it so well that I seem to hear it speaking. It is indeed
   true, that as the ungodly and profane rush headlong into every kind of
   wickedness, as if they were never to be called to render up an account
   of it, the judgment which David here expresses may be formed even from
   their life; but his language is much more emphatic when he says, that
   the servants of God openly perceive the depravity of such persons
   hidden within the heart. Now David does not speak of the wicked
   generally, but of the abandoned despisers of God. There are many who
   indulge in their vices, who, notwithstanding, are not intoxicated by
   the wretched infatuation which David here censures. But when a man
   becomes hardened in committing sin, ungodliness at length reduces him
   to such a state of insensibility, that, despising the judgment of God,
   he indulges without fear in the practice of every sin to which his
   depraved appetite impels him. A reckless assurance, therefore, in the
   commission of sin, and especially where it is associated with a
   contempt and scorn of every holy admonition, is, as it were, an
   enchantment of Satan, which indicates that the condition of such a
   person is indeed hopeless. And although true religion has the effect of
   keeping the hearts of the godly in the fear of God, and drives wicked
   thoughts far from their minds, yet this does not prevent them from
   perceiving and understanding in their hearts how the ungodly are
   agitated with horrible fury when they neither regard God nor are afraid
   of his judgments.

   There is no fear of God before his eyes David shows in these few words
   the end of all evil suggestions; and it is this, that the sense both of
   good and evil being destroyed or suppressed, men shrink from nothing,
   as if there were not seated in heaven a God, the Judge of all. The
   meaning therefore is, Ungodliness speaks in my heart to the wicked man,
   urging him to the extremity of madness, so that, laying aside all fear
   of God, he abandons himself to the practice of sin; that is to say, I
   know as well what the ungodly imagine in their hearts, as if God had
   set me as a witness or judge to unveil their hypocrisy, under the mask
   of which they think their detestable malice is hidden and deeply
   buried. When the wicked, therefore, are not restrained by the fear of
   God from committing sin, this proceeds from that secret discourse with
   themselves, to which we have referred, and by which their understanding
   is so depraved and blinded, that, like brute beasts, they run to every
   excess in rioting. Since the eyes are, as it were, the guides and
   conductors of man in this life, and by their influence move the other
   senses hither and thither, it is therefore said that men have the fear
   of God before their eyes when it regulates their lives, and by
   presenting itself to them on every side to which they may turn, serves
   like a bridle to restrain their appetites and passions. David, by using
   here a contrary form of expression, means that the ungodly run to every
   excess in licentiousness, without having any regard to God, because the
   depravity of their own hearts has completely blinded them.

   2 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes Here the Psalmist shows by
   their fruits or the marks of their character, that there is no fear of
   God among the wicked, seeing they take such pleasure in committing
   deeds of wickedness, that, although hateful in the sight of all other
   men, they still cherish the natural obstinacy of their hearts, and
   wilfully harden themselves in their evil course. First, he says that
   they nourish their vices by flatteries, [3] that they may not be
   dissatisfied with themselves in sinning. But when he adds, until their
   iniquity be found to be hateful, by these words he is to be understood
   as referring to their determined obstinacy; for the meaning is, that
   while they falsely flatter themselves, they proceed to such an extent
   in their evil course, that their iniquity becomes hateful to all men.
   Some translate the words thus: So that he himself finds his own
   iniquity to be hateful; and understand them as meaning, that the wicked
   persist in rushing headlong into sin without restraint, until, satiated
   or glutted with the indulgence of their depraved desires, they begin to
   loathe it: for even the most depraved are sometimes dissatisfied with
   themselves on account of their sinful conduct. The first interpretation
   is, however, the more natural, namely, that the wicked, though they are
   hateful to all men on account of their iniquity, which, when once
   discovered and made manifest, excites a general feeling of displeasure,
   are not affected by any displeasure against themselves, but, on the
   contrary, rather applaud themselves, whilst the people despise them,
   and abhor the wickedness of their lives. The prophet, therefore,
   condemns them for their infatuation in this, that while all others are
   offended at their disgraceful conduct, they themselves are not at all
   affected by it. As far as in them lies, they abolish all distinction
   between good and evil, and lull their conscience into a state of
   insensibility, lest it should pain them, and urge them to repentance.
   Certainly the infatuation here described ought to be the subject of our
   serious consideration, the infatuation which is manifested in this,
   that men who are given up to a reprobate mind, while they render
   themselves hateful in the sight of all other men, are notwithstanding
   destitute of all sense of their own sins.

   3. The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit. The two clauses of
   this verse may be understood as referring to the same thing, namely,
   that the wicked indulging in deceit and vanity, will not receive or
   admit the light of understanding. This, I apprehend, is the meaning of
   David. He reproves the wicked not merely for circumventing others by
   their wiles and stratagems, but especially because they are altogether
   destitute of uprightness and sincerity. We have already said that the
   Psalmist is here speaking not of sinful and wicked men, in whose hearts
   there still remains some fear of God, but of the profane despisers of
   his name, who have given themselves up entirely to the practice of sin.
   He therefore says that they have always in their mouth some frivolous
   excuses and vain pretexts, by which they encourage themselves in
   rejecting and scoffing at all sound doctrine. He then adds, that they
   purposely suppress in themselves all knowledge or understanding of the
   distinction between good and evil, because they have no desire to
   become better than they are. We know that God has given understanding
   to men to direct them to do what is good. Now David says that the
   wicked shun it, and strive to deprive themselves of it, that they may
   not be constrained to repent of their wickedness, and to amend their
   lives. We are taught from this passage, that if at any time we turn
   aside from the path of rectitude, the only remedy in such a case is to
   open the eyes of our understanding, that we may rightly distinguish
   between good and evil, and that thus we may be led back from our
   wandering. When, instead of doing this, a man refuses instruction, it
   is an indication that he is in a state of depravity altogether
   desperate.

   4. He meditates iniquity upon his bed Here the sacred writer shows that
   the wickedness of the ungodly man is of a secret and very determined
   character. It sometimes happens that many, who otherwise are not
   disposed to wickedness, err and fall into sin, because occasion
   presents itself all on a sudden; but David tells us, that the wicked,
   even when they are withdrawn from the sight of men, and in retirement,
   form schemes of mischief; and thus, although there is not presented
   before them any temptation, or the evil example of others to excite
   them to it, they, of their own accord, devise mischief, and urge
   themselves to it without being impelled by any thing else. Since he
   describes the reprobate by this distinguishing mark of character, that
   they devise mischief upon their beds, true believers should learn from
   this to exercise themselves when alone in meditations of a different
   nature, and to make their own life the subject of examination, so that
   they may exclude all evil thoughts from their minds. The Psalmist next
   refers to their stubbornness, declaring that they set themselves in a
   crooked and perverse way; that is to say, they purposely and wilfully
   harden themselves in doing evil. Finally, he adds the reason of their
   doing this: They abhor not evil Wilfully shutting their eyes, they rush
   forward in their headlong course till they spontaneously yield
   themselves the slaves of wickedness. Let us now shortly state the
   contrast between the ungodly and the people of God, contained in the
   preceding verses. The former deceive themselves by flattery; the latter
   exercise over themselves a strict control, and examine themselves with
   a rigid scrutiny: the former, throwing loose the reins, rush headlong
   into evil; the latter are restrained by the fear of God: the former
   cloak or disguise their offenses by sophistry, and turn light into
   darkness; the latter willingly acknowledge their guilt, and by a candid
   confession are brought to repentance: the former reject all sound
   judgment; the latter always desire to vindicate themselves by coming to
   the open light of day: the former upon their bed invent various ways of
   doing evil; the latter are sedulously on their guard that they may not
   devise or stir up within themselves any sinful desire: the former
   indulge a deep and fixed contempt of God; the latter willingly cherish
   a constant displeasure at their sins.

   [1] "C'est, tant que chacun commence a avoir en haine l'iniquite
   d'iceluy." -- Fr. marg. "That is, so that every one begins to hate his
   iniquity."

   [2] "Mensonge." -- Fr. "Falsehood."

   [3] The verb chlph, chalak, which is rendered flattereth, signifies to
   smooth, and means here, that the wicked man described endeavors by
   plausible arguments to put a soft, smooth, and fair gloss on his
   wickedness, as if there were nothing repulsive and hateful about it,
   nothing amiss or blame-worthy in it; and in this way he deceives
   himself. This is the sense expressed in the literal translation of
   Montanus, which seems very forcible: "Quoniam lenivit ad se in oculis
   ipsius, ad inveniendum iniquitatem suam ad odiendam." -- "For he has
   smoothed over [or set a polish] to himself in his own eyes, with
   respect to the finding out of his iniquity, [that is, so as not to find
   it out,] to hate it." Horsley reads, "For he giveth things a fair
   appearance to himself,
   In his own eyes, so that he discovers not his own
   iniquityto hate it." "He sets such a false gloss," says this critic,
   "in his own eyes, upon his worst actions, that he never finds out the
   blackness of his iniquity, which, were it perceived by him, would be
   hateful even to himself." The wicked in all ages have thus contrived to
   put a fair appearance upon the most unprincipled maxims and pernicious
   practices. It will be seen that Montanus' and Horsley's translation of
   the last clause of the verse gives a different meaning from that given
   by Calvin. The original text is somewhat obscure and ambiguous from its
   brevity; but it seems to support the sense given by these critics. The
   Hebrew is, lmts' vnvlsn', limtso avono lisno, to find, or to, for, or
   concerning the finding of, [the first word being an infinitive with the
   prefix l, lamed,] his iniquity to hate [it.] "The prefix l," says
   Walford, "cannot, I imagine, be translated with any propriety by
   until." His rendering is, "For he flattereth himself in his own sight,
   That his iniquity will not be found to be hateful:" That is, will not
   be viewed by others as the hateful thing which it really is. The
   original words will easily bear this sense as well as that given by
   Montanus and Horsley.

   Psalm 36:5-9

   5. O Jehovah! thy mercy is unto the heavens, and thy truth even unto
   the clouds. 6. Thy righteousness is as the mountains of God; [4] thy
   judgments are a great deep: [5] O Jehovah! thou preservest man and
   beast. 7. O God! how excellent [6] is thy loving-kindness! therefore,
   the children of men shall trust in the shadow of thy wings. 8. They
   shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou
   shalt make them to drink of the river of thy pleasures. 9. For with
   thee [7] is the fountain of life; and in thy light [8] shall we see
   light.


   5. O Jehovah! thy mercy is unto the heavens. Commentators think that
   David, after having described the great corruption and depravity which
   every where prevail in the world, takes occasion from thence to extol
   in rapturous praises the wonderful forbearance of God, in not ceasing
   to manifest his favor and good-will towards men, even though they are
   sunk in iniquity and crime. But, as I have already observed, I am of a
   somewhat different opinion. After having spoken of the very great
   depravity of men, the prophet, afraid lest he should become infected by
   it, or be carried away by the example of the wicked, as by a flood,
   quits the subject, and recovers himself by reflecting on a different
   theme. It usually happens, that in condemning the wicked, the contagion
   of their malice insinuates itself into our minds when we are not
   conscious of it; and there is scarcely one in a hundred who, after
   having complained of the malice of others, keeps himself in true
   godliness, pure and unpolluted. The meaning therefore is, Although we
   may see among men a sad and frightful confusion, which, like a great
   gulf, would swallow up the minds of the godly, David, nevertheless,
   maintains that the world is full of the goodness and righteousness of
   God, and that he governs heaven and earth on the strictest principles
   of equity. And certainly, whenever the corruption of the world affects
   our minds, and fills us with amazement, we must take care not to limit
   our views to the wickedness of men who overturn and confound all
   things; but in the midst of this strange confusion, it becomes us to
   elevate our thoughts in admiration and wonder, to the contemplation of
   the secret providence of God. David here enumerates four cardinal
   attributes of Deity, which, according to the figure of speech called
   synecdoche, include all the others, and by which he intimates, in
   short, that although carnal reason may suggest to us that the world
   moves at random, and is directed by chance, yet we ought to consider
   that the infinite power of God is always associated with perfect
   righteousness. In saying that the goodness of God is unto the heavens,
   David's meaning is, that in its greatness it is as high as the heavens.
   In the same sense he adds, Thy truth is even unto the clouds The term
   truth in this place may be taken either for the faithfulness which God
   manifests in accomplishing his promises, or for the just and well
   regulated character of his government, in which his rectitude is seen
   to be pure and free from all deception. But there are many other
   similar passages of Scripture which constrain me to refer it to the
   promises of God, in the keeping and fulfilling of which he is ever
   faithful.

   6. Thy righteousness is as the mountains of God In this verse there is
   a commendation of God's righteousness, which the sacred writer compares
   to the high mountains, (this being the manner of the expression -- "the
   mountains of God," for we know that the Hebrews were accustomed to
   distinguish by the appellation divine, or of God, whatever is
   excellent,) because his glory shines forth more clearly there. In the
   last place, it is said, that his judgments are like a great and
   bottomless abyss. By these words he teaches us, that to whatever side
   we turn our eyes, and whether we look upward or downward, all things
   are disposed and ordered by the just judgment of God. This passage is
   usually quoted in a sense quite different, namely, that the judgments
   of God far exceed our limited capacity, and are too mysterious for our
   being able to comprehend them; and, indeed, in this sense the
   similitude of an abyss is not inappropriate. It is, however, obvious
   from the context, that the language of the Psalmist is to be understood
   in a much more extensive sense, and as meaning, that however great the
   depth of wickedness which there is among men, and though it seems like
   a flood which breaks forth and overflows the whole earth, yet still
   greater is the depth of God's providence, by which he righteously
   disposes and governs all things. Whenever, therefore, our faith may be
   shaken by the confusion and disorder of human affairs, and when we are
   unable to explain the reasons of this disorder and confusion, let us
   remember that the judgments of God in the government of the world are
   with the highest propriety compared to a great depth which fills heaven
   and earth, that the consideration of its infinite greatness may ravish
   our minds with admiration, swallow up all our cares, and dispel all our
   sorrows. When it is added in the end of the verse, O Jehovah! thou
   preservest man and beast, the meaning is to this effect, that since God
   vouchsafes to extend his providential care even to the irrational
   creation, much more does he provide for the wants of men. And, indeed,
   whenever any doubt may arise in our minds regarding the providence of
   God, we should fortify and encourage ourselves by setting before us
   this consideration, that God, who provides food for the beasts of the
   field, and maintains them in their present state, can never cease to
   take care of the human race. The explanation which some have given of
   the term beasts, interpreting it allegorically of beastly men, I regard
   as too forced, and reject it.

   7 O God! how precious is thy loving-kindness! Some explain these words
   in this sense: That the mercy of God is precious, and that the children
   of men who put their trust in it are precious; but this is a sense too
   far removed from the words of the text. Others understand them as
   meaning, that the mercy of God is very great to the gods, that is to
   say, to the angels and the sons of men; but this is too refined. I am
   also surprised that the Jewish Rabbins have wearied and bewildered
   themselves, without any occasion, in seeking to find out new and
   subtile interpretations, since the meaning of the prophet is of itself
   perfectly evident; namely, that it is because the mercy of God is great
   and clearly manifested, that the children of men put their trust under
   the shadow of it. As David has hitherto been speaking in commendation
   of the goodness of God, which extends to every creature, the opinion of
   other commentators, who consider that David is here discoursing of the
   peculiar favor which God manifests towards his children, is in my
   judgment very correct. The language seems to refer in general to all
   the sons of men, but what follows is applicable properly to the
   faithful alone. In order to manifest more clearly the greatness of
   divine grace, he thus speaks in general terms, telling us, that God
   condescends to gather together under his wings the mortal offspring of
   Adam, as it is said in Psalm 8:4,

   "What is man, that thou art mindful of him?
   and the son of man, that thou visitest him?"

   The substance of the passage is this: The ungodly may run to every
   excess in wickedness, but this temptation does not prevent the people
   of God from trusting in his goodness, and casting themselves upon his
   fatherly care; while the ungodly, whose minds are degraded, and whose
   hearts are polluted, never taste the sweetness of his goodness so as to
   be led by it to the faith, and thus to enjoy repose under the shadow of
   his wings. The metaphorical expression of wings, as applied to God, is
   common enough in Scripture. [9] By it God teaches us that we are
   preserved in safety under his protecting care, even as the hen
   cherishes her chickens under her wings; and thus he invites us kindly
   and affectionately to return to him.

   8. They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of that house. I
   have no doubt that by the fatness of God's house the prophet means the
   abundance of good things which is not designed for all men
   indiscriminately, but is laid up in store for the children of God who
   commit themselves wholly to his protection. Some restrict the
   expression to spiritual graces; but to me it seems more likely, that
   under it are comprehended all the blessings that are necessary to the
   happiness and comfort of the present life, as well as those which
   pertain to eternal and heavenly blessedness. It ought, however, to be
   observed, that in the style of speaking which the prophet here employs,
   the use of earthly blessings is connected with the gracious experience
   of faith, in the exercise of which we can alone enjoy them rightfully
   and lawfully to our own welfare. When the ungodly glut themselves with
   the abundance of God's benefits, their bodies indeed grow fat like the
   flesh of cattle or swine, but their souls are always empty and
   famished. It is the faithful alone, as I have said, who are satisfied
   with the goodness of God towards them, because it is to them a pledge
   of his fatherly love. The expression meat and drink denotes a complete
   and perfect fullness, and the term river, [10] denotes an overflowing
   abundance.

   9. For with thee is the fountain of life The Psalmist here confirms the
   doctrine of the preceding verse, the knowledge of which is so
   profitable that no words can adequately express it. As the ungodly
   profane even the best of God's gifts by their wicked abuse of them,
   unless we observe the distinction which I have stated, it were better
   for us to perish a hundred times of hunger, than to be fed abundantly
   by the goodness of God. The ungodly do not acknowledge that it is in
   God they live, move, and have their being, but rather imagine that they
   are sustained by their own power; and, accordingly, David, on the
   contrary, here affirms from the experience of the godly, and as it were
   in their name, that the fountain of life is in God. By this he means,
   that there is not a drop of life to be found without him, or which
   flows not from his grace. The metaphor of light, in the last clause of
   the verse, is tacitly most emphatic, denoting that men are altogether
   destitute of light, except in so far as the Lord shines upon them. If
   this is true of the light; of this life, how shall we be able to behold
   the light of the heavenly world, unless the Spirit of God enlighten us?
   for we must maintain that the measure of understanding with which men
   are by nature endued is such, that

   "the light shineth in darkness,
   but the darkness comprehendeth it not," (John 1:5;)

   and that men are enlightened only by a supernatural gift. But it is the
   godly alone who perceive that they derive their light from God, and
   that, without it, they would continue, as it were, buried and smothered
   in darkness.

   [4] In the French version it is, "Comme hautes montagnes;" -- "as the
   high mountains;" and in the margin Calvin states that the Hebrew is,
   "Montagnes de Dieu;" -- "Mountains of God." The Hebrews were accustomed
   to describe things eminent, as Calvin observes in his exposition of the
   verse, by adding to them the name of God; as, "river of God;" Psalm
   65:9; "mount of God," Psalm 68:15; "cedars of God," Psalm 80:10; "the
   trees of the Lord," Psalm 104:16. "The mountains of God," therefore,
   here mean the highest mountain.

   [5] Lowth reads, "A vast abyss."

   [9] "Frequens in Psalmis figura ab alio Cherubinorum Arcae," etc. i.e.
   "A common figure in the Psalms, taken more immediately, in my opinion,
   from the wings of the Cherubim overshadowing the mercy-seat which
   covered the ark; but more remotely from birds, which defend their young
   from the solar rays by overshadowing them with their wings. See Psalm
   17:8; 57:1; 61:4; 91:4, etc., and Deuteronomy 32:11." -- Bishop Hare.

   [10] The words in the original are, nchl tyk, nachal adanecha, the
   river of thy Eden, in which there is probably an allusion to the garden
   of rn Eden, and to the river which flowed through and watered it.

   Psalm 36:10-12

   10. Prolong [11] thy mercy to them that know thee, and thy
   righteousness to the upright in heart. 11. Let not the foot of pride
   come upon me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me. 12. There
   the workers of iniquity are fallen: they are thrust down, and shall not
   be able to rise.


   10. Prolong thy mercy to them that know thee. David now sets himself to
   pray. And, first, he asks in general, that God would continue his mercy
   to all the godly, and then he pleads particularly in his own behalf,
   imploring the help of God against his enemies. Those who affirm that
   God is here said to prolong or extend his mercy because it is exalted
   above the heavens, indulge in a style of speaking too puerile. When
   David spake of it in such terms in a preceding verse, his intention was
   not, as I have already said, to represent the mercy of God as shut up
   in heaven, but simply to declare that it was diffused throughout the
   world; and here what he desires is just this, that God would continue
   to manifest, even to the end, his mercy towards his people. With the
   mercy of God he connects his righteousness, combining them as cause and
   effect. We have already said in another place, that the righteousness
   of God is manifested in his undertaking the defense of his own people,
   vindicating their innocence, avenging their wrongs, restraining their
   enemies, and in proving himself faithful in the preservation of their
   welfare and happiness against all who assail them. Now, since all this
   is done for them freely by God, David, with good reason, makes mention
   particularly of his goodness, and places it first in order, that we may
   learn to depend entirely upon his favor. We ought also to observe the
   epithets by which he describes true believers; first, he says, that
   they know God; and, secondly, that they are upright in heart. We learn
   from this that true godliness springs from the knowledge of God, and
   again, that the light of faith must necessarily dispose us to
   uprightness of heart. At the same time, we ought always to bear in
   mind, that we only know God aright when we render to him the honor to
   which he is entitled; that is, when we place entire confidence in him.

   11. Let not the foot of pride come upon me As I have observed a little
   before, the Psalmist here applies to his own circumstances the prayer
   which he had offered. But by including in his prayer in the preceding
   verse all the children of God, he designed to show that he asked
   nothing for himself apart from others, but only desired that as one of
   the godly and upright, who have their eyes directed to God, he might
   enjoy his favor. He has employed the expressions, the foot of pride,
   [12] and the hand of the wicked, in the same sense. As the wicked rush
   boldly to the destruction of good men, lifting up their feet to tread
   upon them, and having their hands ready to do them wrong, David
   entreats God to restrain their hands and their feet; and thus he
   confesses that he is in danger of being exposed to their insolence,
   abuse, and violence, unless God come speedily to his aid.

   12. There the workers of iniquity are fallen. Here he derives
   confidence from his prayer, not doubting that he has already obtained
   his request. And thus we see how the certainty of faith directs the
   saints to prayer. Besides, still farther to confirm his confidence and
   hope in God, he shows, as it were, by pointing to it with the finger,
   the certain destruction of the wicked, even though it lay as yet
   concealed in the future. In this respect, the adverb there [13] is not
   superfluous; for while the ungodly boast of their good fortune, and the
   world applaud them, David beholds by the eye of faith, as if from a
   watch-tower, their destruction, and speaks of it with as much
   confidence as if he had already seen it realised. That we also may
   attain a similar assurance, let us remember, that those who would
   hasten prematurely the time of God's vengeance upon the wicked,
   according to the ardor of their desires, do indeed err, and that we
   ought to leave it to the providence of God to fix the period when, in
   his wisdom, he shall rise up to judgment. When it is said, They are
   thrust down, the meaning is, that they are agitated with doubt, and
   totter as in a slippery place, so that in the midst of their prosperity
   they have no security. Finally, it is added, that they shall fall into
   utter destruction, so that it can never be expected that they shall
   rise again.

   PSALM 37

   This psalm, the title of which shows it to have been composed by David,
   contains most profitable instruction. Since the faithful, so long as
   they pursue their earthly pilgrimage through life, see things strangely
   confused in the world, unless they assuaged their grief with the hope
   of a better issue, their courage would soon fail them. The more boldly
   any man despises God, and runs to every excess in wickedness, so much
   the more happily he seems to live. And since prosperity appears to be a
   token of God's favor towards the ungodly, what conclusion, it may be
   said, can be drawn from this, but either that the world is governed by
   chance, and that fortune bears the sovereignty, or else that God makes
   no difference between the good and the bad? The Spirit of God
   accordingly confirms and strengthens us in this psalm against the
   assaults of such a temptation. However great the prosperity which the
   wicked enjoy for a time, he declares their felicity to be transient and
   evanescent, and that, therefore, they are miserable, while the
   happiness of which they boast is cursed; whereas the pious and devoted
   servants of God never cease to be happy, even in the midst of their
   greatest calamities, because God takes care of them, and at length
   comes to their aid in due season. This, indeed, is paradoxical, and
   wholly repugnant to human reason. For as good men often suffer extreme
   poverty, and languish long under many troubles, and are loaded with
   reproaches and wrongs, while the wicked and profligate triumph, and are
   regaled with pleasures, might we not suppose that God cares not for the
   things that are done on earth? It is on this account that, as I have
   already said, the doctrine of this psalm is so much the more
   profitable; because, withdrawing our thoughts from the present aspect
   of things, it enjoins us to confide in the providence of God, until he
   stretch forth his hand to help those who are his servants, and demand
   of the ungodly a strict account of their lives, as of thieves and
   robbers who have foully abused his bounty and paternal goodness.

   A Psalm of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 37:1-6

   1. Fret not thyself because of the wicked, and be not envious at the
   workers of iniquity: 2. For they shall soon be cut down like grass; and
   they shall wither as the green and tender herb. 3. Put thy trust in
   Jehovah, and do good; dwell in the land, and be fed in truth, [or
   faithfully. [14] ] 4. And delight thyself in Jehovah, and he will give
   thee the desires of thy heart. 5. Roll [or devolve] thy ways on
   Jehovah, and trust in him, and he will bring it to pass. 6. And he will
   bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgments [15] as
   the noon day.


   1. Fret not thyself because of the wicked. David lays down this as a
   general principle, that the prosperity of the wicked, in which they
   greatly rejoice, should on no account vex or disquiet the children of
   God, because it will soon fade away. On the other hand, although the
   people of God are afflicted for a time, yet the issue of their
   afflictions shall be such, that they have every reason to be contented
   with their lot. Now all this depends upon the providence of God; for
   unless we are persuaded that the world is governed by him in
   righteousness and truth, our minds will soon stagger, and at length
   entirely fail us. David then condemns two sinful affections of the
   mind, which are indeed closely allied, and the one of which is
   generated by the other. He first enjoins the faithful not to fret on
   account of the wicked; and, secondly, that they should not indulge an
   envious spirit towards them. For, in the first place, when they see the
   wicked enjoying prosperity, from which it might naturally be supposed
   that God regards not the affairs of men, there is a danger lest they
   should shake off the fear of God, and apostatise from the faith. Then
   another temptation follows, namely, that the influence of the example
   of the wicked excites in them a desire to involve themselves in the
   same wickedness with them. This is the natural sense. The Hebrew words,
   'l-ttchr, al-tithechar, which we have rendered, Fret not thyself, are
   by some translated, Do not mingle thyself with. [16] But this
   interpretation is too forced, and may be disproved by the context; for
   in the eighth verse, where mention is expressly made of wrath and
   anger, it would surely be absurd to interpret in another sense the same
   verb which immediately follows these two words, and which is there used
   in the same sense and for the same end as in this first verse. In the
   second place, the order which David observes is very natural; for when
   the prosperity of the wicked has irritated our minds, we very soon
   begin to envy them their happiness and ease. First, then, he exhorts us
   to be on our guard, lest a happiness which is only transitory, or
   rather imaginary, should vex or disquiet us; and, secondly, lest envy
   should lead us to commit sin. The reason by which he enforces this
   exhortation is added in the following verse: for if the wicked flourish
   to-day like the grass of the field, to-morrow they shall be cut down
   and wither. We need not wonder that this similitude is often to be met
   with in the sacred writings, since it is so very appropriate; for we
   see how soon the strength of the grass decays, and that when cast down
   by a blast of wind, or parched with the heat of the sun, even without
   being cut by the hand of man, it withers away. [17] In like manner,
   David tells us that the judgment of God, like a scythe in the hand of
   man, shall cut down the wicked, so that they shall suddenly perish.

   3. Put thy trust in Jehovah, and do good. The inspired writer now goes
   on, in the second place, to say, that every thing in the end shall be
   well with the righteous, because they are under the protection of God.
   But as there is nothing better or more desirable than to enjoy the
   fostering and protecting care of God, he exhorts them to put their
   trust in him, and at the same time to follow after goodness and truth.
   It is not without good reason that he begins with the doctrine of
   faith, or trust in God; for there is nothing more difficult for men
   than to preserve their minds in a state of peace and tranquillity,
   undisturbed by any disquieting fears, whilst they are in this world,
   which is subject to so many changes. On the other hand, while they see
   the wicked becoming rich by unjust means, extending their influence,
   and acquiring power by unrestrained indulgence in sin, it is no less
   difficult for them steadily to persevere in a life of piety and virtue.
   Nor is it sufficient merely to disregard those things that are commonly
   sought after with the greatest eagerness. Some of the philosophers of
   antiquity were so noble-minded, that they despised riches unjustly
   acquired, and abstained from fraud and robbery; nay, they held up to
   ridicule the vain pomp and splendor of the wicked, which the common
   people look upon with such high admiration. But as they were destitute
   of faith, they defrauded God of his honor, and so it happened that they
   never knew what it was to be truly happy. Now, as David places faith
   first in order, to show that God is the author of all good, and that by
   his blessing alone prosperity is to be looked for; so it ought to be
   observed that he connects this with a holy life: for the man who places
   his whole confidence in God, and gives himself up to be governed by
   him, will live uprightly and innocently, and will devote himself to
   doing good.

   Dwell in the land This language is much more expressive than if he had
   promised that the righteous should dwell securely in the land. [18] It
   is just as if he had led them to the place, and put them in possession
   of it. Moreover, by these words he declares that they shall long enjoy
   it. They are, it is true, only strangers or sojourners in this world,
   yet the hand of the Lord is stretched forth to protect them, so that
   they live in security and peace. This David again confirms by the
   following clause, Thou shalt be fed in truth Assured of the protection
   of God, he exhorts them to place entire and unsuspecting confidence in
   him. It is surprising to find how interpreters have wrested, and as it
   were mangled this clause, by the different meanings they have put upon
   it. Some take the verb to feed in an active signification; and others
   understand the expression to feed on faith as denoting to cherish
   within the heart the promises of God. Others are of opinion that David
   exhorts us to feed our brethren with faith by ministering to them the
   pure word of God, which is the spiritual food of the soul. Others
   render the term for faith in the sense of sincerity, so that the
   expression to feed on faith would signify to behave in an upright and
   honest manner among men. But the scope and connection of the passage
   necessarily require, and it is quite in accordance with the nature of
   the Hebrew language, that the verb rh, re-eh, should be taken in a
   passive signification, Be fed This, too, is the opinion of the greater
   part of commentators, who, notwithstanding, afterwards differ in
   explaining its meaning. Some of them adopt the interpretation, that we
   are fed with faith, when the promises of God suffice us, and we are
   satisfied with them. Others give this explanation, Feed thyself with
   the fruit of faith, because God will indeed show that we have not
   believed his word in vain. Others explain it in this way, Let truth be
   thy food, and let nothing give thee greater pleasure than to converse
   sincerely and frankly with thy neighbors. There is still another
   interpretation which, although in some respects different, is similar
   to the preceding, namely, Live not upon spoil, but be content with
   lawful sustenance; that is to say, with that which is lawfully
   acquired. [19] It is certainly a shameful and disgraceful thing that so
   many learned men should have erred in a matter so plain and obvious.
   [20] Had not every one been led by his own ambition to seek for
   something new, the true and natural meaning of the prophet would have
   occurred at once, which is this, Dwell in the land, that thou mayest
   enjoy it in sure and lasting repose. The Hebrew word 'mvnh, emunah, not
   only signifies truth or faith, but also secure continuance for a long
   period. And who does not see that since the possession of the land was
   given to the righteous, this latter clause was added by way of
   exposition?

   4. And delight thyself in Jehovah This delight is set in opposition to
   the vain and deceitful allurements of the world, which so intoxicate
   the ungodly, that despising the blessing of God, they dream of no other
   happiness than what presents itself for the time before their eyes.
   This contrast between the vain and fickle joys with which the world is
   deluded, and the true repose enjoyed by the godly, ought to be
   carefully observed; for whether all things smile upon us, or whether
   the Lord exercise us with adversities, we ought always to hold fast
   this principle, that as the Lord is the portion of our inheritance, our
   lot has fallen in pleasant places, [21] as we have seen in Psalm 16:5,
   6. We must therefore constantly recall to our minds this truth, that it
   can never be well with us except in so far as God is gracious to us, so
   that the joy we derive from his paternal favor towards us may surpass
   all the pleasures of the world. To this injunction a promise is added,
   that, if we are satisfied in the enjoyment of God alone, he will
   liberally bestow upon us all that we shall desire: He will give thee
   the desires of thy heart. This does not imply that the godly
   immediately obtain whatever their fancy may suggest to them; nor would
   it be for their profit that God should grant them all their vain
   desires. The meaning simply is, that if we stay our minds wholly upon
   God, instead of allowing our imaginations like others to roam after
   idle and frivolous fancies, all other things will be bestowed upon us
   in due season.

   5. Roll [22] thy ways upon Jehovah. Here David illustrates and confirms
   the doctrine contained in the preceding verse. In order that God may
   accomplish our desires, it behoves us to cast all our cares upon him in
   the exercise of hope and patience. Accordingly, we are taught from this
   passage how to preserve our minds in tranquillity amidst anxieties,
   dangers, and floods of trouble. There can be no doubt, that by the term
   ways we are here to understand all affairs or businesses. The man,
   therefore, who, leaving the issue of all his affairs to the will of
   God, and who, patiently waiting to receive from his hand whatever he
   may be pleased to send, whether prosperity or adversity, casts all his
   cares, and every other burden which he bears, into his bosom; or, in
   other words, commits to him all his affairs, -- such a person rolls his
   ways upon Jehovah Hence, David again inculcates the duty of hope and
   confidence in God: And trust in him By this he intimates, that we
   render to him the honor to which he is entitled only when we intrust to
   him the government and direction of our lives; and thus he provides a
   remedy for a disease with which almost all men are infected. Whence is
   it that the children of God are envious of the wicked, and are often in
   trouble and perplexity, and yield to excess of sorrow, and sometimes
   even murmur and repine, but because, by involving themselves
   immoderately in endless cares, and cherishing too eagerly a desire to
   provide for themselves irrespective of God, they plunge, as it were,
   into an abyss, or at least accumulate to themselves such a vast load of
   cares, that they are forced at last to sink under them? Desirous to
   provide a remedy for this evil, David warns us, that in presuming to
   take upon us the government of our own life, and to provide for all our
   affairs as if we were able to bear so great a burden, we are greatly
   deceived, and that, therefore, our only remedy is to fix our eyes upon
   the providence of God, and to draw from it consolation in all our
   sorrows. Those who obey this counsel shall escape that horrible
   labyrinth in which all men labor in vain; for when God shall once have
   taken the management of our affairs into his own hand, there is no
   reason to fear that prosperity shall ever fail us. Whence is it that he
   forsakes us and disappoints our expectations, if it is not because we
   provoke him, by pretending to greater wisdom and understanding than we
   possess? If, therefore, we would only permit him, he will perform his
   part, and will not disappoint our expectations, which he sometimes does
   as a just punishment for our unbelief.

   6. And he will bring forth thy righteousness as the light This David
   says, in order to anticipate the misgivings which often trouble us when
   we seem to lose our labor in faithfully serving God, and in dealing
   uprightly with our neighbors; nay, when our integrity is either exposed
   to the calumnies of the wicked, or is the occasion of injury to us from
   men; for then it is thought to be of no account in the sight of God.
   David, therefore, declares, that God will not suffer our righteousness
   to be always hid in darkness, but that he will maintain it and bring it
   forth to the light; namely, when he will bestow upon us such a reward
   as we desire. He alludes to the darkness of the night, which is soon
   dispelled by the dawning of the day; as if he had said, We may be often
   grievously oppressed, and God may not seem to approve our innocence,
   yet this vicissitude should no more disturb our minds than the darkness
   of the night which covers the earth; for then the expectation of the
   light of day sustains our hope.

   shalt be fed in security;" Dathe, "Tunc terram inhabitabis et secure

   [22] Calvin here gives the exact sense of the Hebrew verb gll, galal.
   It literally signifies to roll, or to devolve; and in this passage it
   evidently means, Roll or devolve all thy concerns upon God; "cast thy
   burden upon him," as it is in Psalm 55:22; "the metaphor being taken,"
   says Cresswell, "from a burden put by one who is unequal to it upon a
   stronger man." But Dr Adam Clarke thinks that the idea may be taken
   from the camel who lies down till his load be rolled upon him.

   Psalm 37:7-11

   7. Be silent to Jehovah, and wait for him; fret not because of the man
   who prospereth in his way, against the man who commits wickedness. [23]
   8. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself so as to do
   evil, 9. For the wicked shall be cut off; but those that wait upon
   Jehovah shall inherit the earth. 10. Yet a little while; and the wicked
   shall not be; and thou shalt look upon his place, and shalt not find
   him. 11. But the meek shall inherit the earth, [24] and shall delight
   themselves in the abundance of peace.


   7. Be silent to Jehovah. The Psalmist continues the illustration of the
   same doctrine, namely, that we should patiently and meekly bear those
   things that usually disquiet our minds; for amid innumerable sources of
   disquietude and conflict there is need of no small patience. By the
   similitude of silence, which often occurs in the sacred writings, he
   declares most aptly the nature of faith; for as our affections rise in
   rebellion against the will of God, so faith, restoring us to a state of
   humble and peaceful submission, appeases all the tumults of our hearts.
   By this expression, [25] therefore, David commands us not to yield to
   the tumultuous passions of the soul, as the unbelieving do, nor
   fretfully to set ourselves in opposition to the authority of God, but
   rather to submit peacefully to him, that he may execute his work in
   silence. Moreover, as the Hebrew word chvl, chul, which we have
   rendered to wait, sometimes signifies to mourn, and sometimes to wait,
   the word htchvll, hithcholel, in this place is understood by some as
   meaning to mourn moderately, or to bear sorrow patiently. It might also
   be rendered more simply to mourn before God, in order that he might be
   a witness of all our sorrows; for when the unbelieving give way to
   doubt and suspense, they rather murmur against him than utter their
   complaints before him. As, however, the other interpretation is more
   generally received, namely, that David is exhorting us to hope and
   patience, I adhere to it. The prophet Isaiah also connects hope with
   silence in the same sense, (Isaiah 30:15.)

   David next repeats what he had said in the first verse, Fret not
   because of the man who prospereth in his way, or who brings his ways to
   a happy issue; nor against the man who behaveth himself wickedly, or
   who accomplishes his devices Of these two interpretations of this last
   clause, the latter is more in accordance with the scope of the psalm. I
   confess, indeed, that the word mzmvt mezimmoth, is commonly taken in a
   bad sense for fraud and stratagem. But as zmm zamam, sometimes
   signifies in general to meditate, the nature of the Hebrew language
   will bear this meaning, that to execute his devices is of the same
   import as to effect what he has purposed. Now we see that these two
   things are connected, namely to dispose his ways according to his
   desires, or to prosper in his way, and to accomplish his devices It is
   a very great temptation to us and difficult to bear, when we see
   fortune smiling upon the ungodly, as if God approved of their
   wickedness; nay, it excites our wrath and indignation. David,
   therefore, not contented with a short admonition, insists at some
   length upon this point.

   The accumulation of terms which occurs in the next verse, in which he
   lays a restraint as with a bridle upon anger, allays wrath and assuages
   passion, it is not superfluous; but, as in necessary, he rather
   prescribes numerous remedies for a disease which it is difficult to
   cure. By this means, he reminds us how easily we are provoked, and how
   ready we are to take offence, unless we lay a powerful restraint upon
   our tumultuous passions, and keep them under control. And although the
   faithful are not able to subdue the lusts of the flesh without much
   trouble and labour, whilst the prosperity of the wicked excites their
   impatience, yet this repetition teaches us that we ought unceasingly to
   wrestle against them; for if we steadily persevere, we know that our
   endeavors shall not be in vain in the end. I differ from other
   commentators in the exposition of the last clause. They translate it,
   at least to do evil; as if David meant that we should appease our anger
   lest it should lead us to do mischief. But as the particle 'k, ach,
   which they translate at least, is often used affirmatively in Hebrew, I
   have no doubt that David here teaches, that it cannot be otherwise than
   that the offense which we take at the prosperity of the wicked should
   lead us to sin, unless we speedily check it; as it is said in another
   Psalm,

   "God will break the cords of the ungodly, lest the righteous put forth
   their hands unto iniquity," (Psalm 125:3.)

   9. For the wicked shall be cut off. It is not without cause that he
   repeatedly inculcates the same thing, namely, that the happiness and
   prosperity which the ungodly enjoy is only a mask or phantom; for the
   first sight of it so dazzles our senses, that we are unable to form a
   proper estimate of what will be its issue, in the light of which alone
   we ought to judge of the value of all that has preceded. But the
   contrast between the two clauses of the verse ought to be observed.
   First, in saying that the wicked shall be cut off, he intimates that
   they shall flourish fresh and green till the time of their destruction
   shall arrive; and, secondly, in allotting the earth to the godly,
   saying, They shall inherit the earth, he means that they shall live in
   such a manner as that the blessing of God shall follow them, even to
   the grave. Now, as I have already said, the present condition of men is
   to be estimated by the state in which it will terminate. From the
   epithet by which he distinguishes the children of God, we learn that
   they are exercised by a severe conflict for the trial of their faith;
   for he speaks of them, not as righteous or godly, but as those that
   wait upon the Lord. What purpose would this waiting serve, unless they
   groaned under the burden of the cross? Moreover, the possession of the
   earth which he promises to the children of God is not always realised
   to them; because it is the will of the Lord that they should live as
   strangers and pilgrims in it; neither does he permit them to have any
   fixed abode in it, but rather tries them with frequent troubles, that
   they may desire with greater alacrity the everlasting dwelling-place of
   heaven. The flesh is always seeking to build its nest for ever here;
   and were we not tossed hither and thither, and not suffered to rest, we
   would by and by forget heaven and the everlasting inheritance. Yet, in
   the midst of this disquietude, the possession of the earth, of which
   David here speaks, is not taken away from the children of God; for they
   know most certainly that they are the rightful heirs of the world.
   Hence it is that they eat their bread with a quiet conscience, and
   although they suffer want, yet God provides for their necessities in
   due season. Finally, although the ungodly labor to effect their
   destruction, and reckon them unworthy to live upon the earth, yet God
   stretches forth his hand and protects them; nay, he so upholds them by
   his power, that they live more securely in a state of exile, than the
   wicked do in their nests to which they are attached. And thus the
   blessing, of which David speaks, is in part secret and hidden, because
   our reason is so dull, that we cannot comprehend what it is to possess
   the earth; and yet the faithful truly feel and understand that this
   promise is not made to them in vain, since, having fixed the anchor of
   their faith in God, they pass their life every day in peace, while God
   makes it manifest in their experience, that the shadow of his hand is
   sufficient to protect them.

   10 Yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be. This is a
   confirmation of the preceding verse. It might well have been objected,
   that the actual state of things in the world is very different from
   what David here represents it, since the ungodly riot in their
   pleasures, and the people of God pine away in sickness and poverty.
   David, therefore, wishing to guard us against a rash and hasty
   judgment, exhorts us to be quiet for a little while, till the Lord cut
   off the wicked entirely, and show the efficacy of his grace towards his
   own people. What he requires then on the part of the true believers is,
   that in the exercise of their wisdom they should suspend their judgment
   for a time, and not stop at every trifle, but exercise their thoughts
   in meditation upon divine providence, until God show out of heaven that
   the full time is come. Instead, however, of describing them as those
   who wait upon the Lord, he now speaks of them as the meek; and this he
   does not without good reason: for unless a man believe that God
   preserves his own people in a wonderful manner, as if they were like
   sheep among wolves, he will be always endeavoring to repel force by
   force. [26] It is hope alone, therefore, which of itself produces
   meekness; for, by restraining the impetuosity of the flesh, and
   allaying its vehemence, it trains to equanimity and patience those who
   submit themselves to God. From this passage it would seem, that Christ
   has taken that which is written in Matthew 5:5. The word peace is
   generally employed in the Hebrew to denote the prosperous and happy
   issue of things; yet another sense will agree better with this place,
   namely, that while the ungodly shall be agitated with inward trouble,
   and God shall encompass them on every side with terror, the faithful
   shall rejoice in the abundance of peace. It is not meant that they are
   exempted from trouble, but they are sustained by the tranquillity of
   their minds; so that accounting all the trials which they endure to be
   only temporary, they now rejoice in hope of the promised rest.

   Psalm 37:12-15

   12. The wicked plotteth against the righteous, and gnasheth upon him
   with his teeth. 13. But the Lord [27] shall laugh at him; for he seeth
   that his day is coming. 14. The wicked draw their sword, and bend their
   bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay those that are of
   upright ways. 15. But their sword shall enter into their own heart, and
   their bow shall be broken.


   12. The wicked plotteth against the righteous. David here anticipates
   an objection which might have been taken to the preceding verse. Where,
   it might be said, can tranquillity and joy be found when the wicked are
   mad with rage, and plot every kind of mischief against the children of
   God? And how shall they cherish good hope for the future who see
   themselves surrounded with innumerable sources of death? David
   therefore replies, That although the life of the godly should be
   assailed by many dangers, yet they are secure in the aid and protection
   of God; and that however much the wicked should plot against them, they
   shall be continually preserved. Thus, the design of David is to obviate
   our fears, lest the malice of the ungodly should terrify us above
   measure, as if they had the power of doing with us according to their
   pleasure. [28] He indeed confesses that they are not only full of
   fraud, and expert in deceiving, but also that they burn with anger, and
   a raging desire of doing mischief, when he says, that they plot
   mischief deceitfully against the righteous, and gnash upon them with
   their teeth But after making this statement, he immediately adds, that
   their endeavors shall be vain. Yet he seems to provide very coldly for
   our consolation under sorrow, for he represents God as merely laughing
   But if God values highly our salvation, why does he not set himself to
   resist the fury of our enemies, and vigorously oppose them? We know
   that this, as has been said in Psalm 2:4, is a proper trial of our
   patience, when God does not come forth at once, armed for the
   discomfiture of the ungodly, but connives for a time and withholds his
   hand. But as the eye of sense in such circumstances reckons that he
   delays his coming too long, and from that delay concludes that he
   indulges in ease, and feels no interest in the affairs of men, it is no
   small consolation to be able by the eye of faith to behold him
   laughing; for then we are assured that he is not seated idly in heaven,
   nor closes his eyes, resigning to chance the government of the world,
   but purposely delays and keeps silence because he despises their vanity
   and folly.

   And lest the flesh should still murmur and complain, demanding why God
   should only laugh at the wicked, and not rather take vengeance upon
   them, the reason is added, that he sees the day of their destruction at
   hand: For he seeth that his day [29] is coming. Whence is it that the
   injuries we sustain from the wickedness of man so trouble us, if it be
   not that, when not obtaining a speedy redress, we begin to despair of
   ever seeing a better state of things? But he who sees the executioner
   standing behind the aggressor with drawn sword no longer desires
   revenge, but rather exults in the prospect of speedy retribution.
   David, therefore, teaches us that it is not meet that God, who sees the
   destruction of the wicked to be at hand, should rage and fret after the
   manner of men. There is then a tacit distinction here made between God
   and men, who, amidst the troubles and confusions of the world, do not
   see the day of the wicked coming, and who, oppressed by cares and
   fears, cannot laugh, but because vengeance is delayed, rather become so
   impatient that they murmur and fret. It is not, however, enough for us
   to know that God acts in a manner altogether different from us, unless
   we learn to weep patiently whilst he laughs, so that our tears may be a
   sacrifice of obedience. In the meantime, let us pray that he would
   enlighten us by his light, for by this means alone will we, by
   beholding with the eye of faith his laughter, become partakers thereof,
   even in the midst of sorrow. Some, indeed, explain these two verses in
   another sense; as if David meant to say, that the faithful live so
   happily that the wicked envy them. But the reader will now perceive
   that this is far from the design of the prophet.

   14. The wicked draw their sword, and bend their bow. David now goes on
   to say, that the ungodly, being armed with sword and bow, threaten with
   death the children of God; and this he does in order to meet the
   temptation which would otherwise overwhelm them. The promises of God do
   not have place in a time of quietness and peace, but in the midst of
   severe and terrible conflicts. And, therefore, David now teaches us
   that the righteous are not deprived of that peace of which he had
   spoken a little before, although the wicked should threaten them with
   instant death. The sentence ought to be explained in this way: Although
   the wicked draw their swords and bend their bows to destroy the
   righteous, yet all their efforts shall return upon their own heads, and
   shall tend to their own destruction. But it is necessary to notice the
   particular terms in which the miserable condition of the righteous is
   here described, until God at length vouchsafe to help them. First, they
   are called poor and needy; and, secondly, they are compared to sheep
   devoted to destruction, [30] because they have no power to withstand
   the violence of their enemies, but rather lie oppressed under their
   feet. Whence it follows, that a uniform state of enjoyment here is not
   promised to them in this psalm, but there is only set before them the
   hope of a blessed issue to their miseries and afflictions, in order to
   console them under them. But as it often happens that the wicked are
   hated and treated with severity for their iniquity, the Psalmist adds,
   that those who thus suffered were those who were of upright ways;
   meaning by this, that they were afflicted without cause. Formerly he
   described them as the upright in heart, by which he commended the
   inward purity of the heart; but now he commends uprightness in the
   conduct, and in fulfilling every duty towards our neighbor; and thus he
   shows not only that they are unjustly persecuted, because they have
   done no evil to their enemies, and have given them no cause of offense,
   but also, that though provoked by injuries, they nevertheless do not
   turn aside from the path of duty.

   In the 15th verse, David is not speaking of the laughter of God, but is
   denouncing vengeance against the ungodly, just as we have already seen
   in the second psalm, at the fourth verse, that although God, by
   conniving at the wicked, has often suffered them for a time to run to
   every excess in mirth and rioting, yet he at length speaks to them in
   his anger to overthrow them. The amount of what is stated is, that the
   ungodly should prevail so little, that the sword which they had drawn
   should return into their own bowels, and that their bow should be
   broken in pieces.

   Psalm 37:16-19

   16. Better is the little of the righteous than the abundance of many
   wicked. [31] 17. For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; but
   Jehovah upholdeth the righteous. 18. Jehovah knoweth the days of the
   upright, and their inheritance shall be everlasting. 19. They shall not
   be ashamed in the season of adversity; and in the days of famine they
   shall be satisfied.


   16. Better is the little of the righteous, etc This verse, without any
   sufficient reason, has been variously rendered. The word hmvn, hamon,
   [32] which is rendered abundance, indeed, sometimes signifies a great
   multitude of men, and sometimes abundance of things; sometimes, too, an
   adjective of the plural number is joined to a substantive of the
   singular number. But those who wrest David's words to this sense, that
   a few righteous persons are better than a great multitude of the
   ungodly, [33] plainly destroy their import, and pervert the meaning of
   the whole sentence. Nor can I receive the explanation which others have
   given, that the little which the just man possesses is better than the
   great abundance of the wicked; for I see no necessity for connecting,
   contrary to the rules of grammar, the word hmvn, hamon, which denotes
   abundance, with the word rvym, rabbim. which signifies many or great,
   and not with the word rsym, reshaim, which means wicked I have
   therefore no doubt; that David here contrasts the limited possessions
   of one righteous man with the riches and wealth of many wicked men. The
   Hebrew word rvym, rabbim, however, which I have rendered many, may also
   be properly taken to denote persons of great authority and power.
   Certainly, it is not difficult to understand that David means to say,
   that although the wicked excel in this world, and are enriched with its
   possessions in great abundance and trust in their riches, yet the
   little which the just man possesses is far better than all their
   treasures. From this we learn, that David is here speaking, not so much
   of external grandeur and wealth, as of the secret blessing of God which
   truly enriches the righteous; for although they live from hand to
   mouth, yet are they fed from heaven as it were with manna; while the
   ungodly are always hungry, or else waste away in the very midst of
   their abundance.

   To this also belongs the reason which is added in the next verse,
   namely, that there is nothing stable in the world except it be
   sustained by the power of God; but we are plainly told that the
   righteous only are upheld by him, and that the power of the ungodly
   shall be broken Here again we see, that in order to form a right and
   proper estimate of true felicity, we must look forward to the future,
   or contemplate by the eye of faith the secret grace of God, and his
   hidden judgments. Unless we are persuaded by faith that God cherishes
   us in his bosom as a father does his children, our poverty will always
   be a source of trouble to us; and, on the other hand, unless we bear in
   mind what is here said concerning the wicked, that their arms shall be
   broken, we will make too great account of their present condition. But
   if this doctrine be deeply fixed in the hearts of the faithful, as soon
   as they shall have learned to rely upon the divine blessing, the
   delight and joy which they will experience from their little store
   shall be equal to the magnanimity with which they shall look down, as
   it were from an eminence, upon the vast treasures in which the ungodly
   glory. At the same time, we are here admonished, that whilst the
   ungodly rely upon their own strength, and proudly boast of it, we ought
   to wait patiently till God arise and break their arms in pieces. As for
   us, the best consolation which we could have in our infirmity is, that
   God himself upholds and strengthens us.

   18 Jehovah knoweth the days of the upright [34] It is not without good
   reason that David so frequently inculcates this doctrine, that the
   righteous are blessed because God provides for their necessities. We
   see how prone the minds of men are to distrust, and how much they are
   vexed by an excess of cares and anxieties from which they are unable to
   extricate themselves, while, on the other hand, they fall into another
   error in being more anxious regarding the future than there is any
   reason for; and yet, however active and industrious in the formation of
   their plans, they are often disappointed in their expectations, and not
   unfrequently fail altogether of success. Nothing, therefore, is more
   profitable for us than to have our eyes continually set upon the
   providence of God, which alone can best provide for us every thing we
   need. On this account, David now says, that God knoweth the days of the
   righteous; that is to say, he is not ignorant of the dangers to which
   they are exposed, and the help which they need. This doctrine we ought
   to improve as a source of consolation under every vicissitude which may
   seem to threaten us with destruction. We may be harassed in various
   ways, and distracted by many dangers, which every moment threaten us
   with death, but this consideration ought to prove to us a sufficient
   ground of comfort, that not only are our days numbered by God, but that
   he also knows all the vicissitudes of our lot on earth. Since God then
   so carefully watches over us for the maintenance of our welfare, we
   ought to enjoy, in this our pilgrimage on earth, as much peace and
   satisfaction as if we were put in full possession of our paternal
   inheritance and home. Because we are regarded by God, David from this
   concludes, that our inheritance is everlasting. Moreover, in declaring
   that those who are upright are thus carefully protected by God, he
   exhorts us to the sincere pursuit of truth and uprightness; and if we
   desire to be placed in safety under the protection of God, let us
   cultivate meekness, and reject with detestation this hellish proverb,
   "We must howl among wolves."

   19 They shall not be ashamed in the season of adversity This verse also
   shows us, that the faithful have no right to expect such exemption as
   the flesh would desire from affliction and trial, but they are assured
   of deliverance in the end; which, though it be indeed obtained, yet it
   is of such a nature as can be realised only by faith. We must regard
   these two things as inseparably connected, namely, that as the faithful
   are mingled among the wicked in this world, so hunger and adversity are
   common to both. The only difference betwixt them is, that God stretches
   forth his hand towards his own people in the time of their need, while
   he abandons the ungodly, and takes no care of them. If it should be
   objected, that the wicked often fare sumptuously in the time of famine,
   and gratify all their desires, whilst the faithful are oppressed with
   poverty and want, I answer, that the fullness of which mention is here
   made consists chiefly in this, that the faithful, though they live
   sparingly, and often labor hard to acquire the means of subsistence,
   are nevertheless fed by God as truly as if they had a greater abundance
   of this world's goods than the ungodly, who greedily devour the good
   things of this life in all their variety and abundance, and yet are
   never satisfied. Besides, as I have elsewhere said, these temporal
   blessings are not always seen flowing in one uniform course. The hand
   of God is indeed always open, but we are straitened and limited in our
   desires, so that our own unbelief is no small hinderance to his
   liberality. Moreover, as our corrupt nature would soon break forth into
   excess, God deals with us more sparingly; and lest he might corrupt us
   by too great indulgence, he trains us to frugality by bestowing with a
   sparing hand what he was ready otherwise to lavish upon us in full
   abundance. And, indeed, whoever shall consider how much addicted we are
   to sensuality and pleasure, will not be surprised that God should
   exercise his own people with poverty and want. But although God may not
   bestow upon us what is necessary for our gratification, yet, unless our
   own ingratitude prevent us, we shall experience, even in famine and
   want, that be nourishes us graciously and liberally.

   Psalm 37:20-22

   20. For the wicked shalt perish, and the enemies of Jehovah shall be
   consumed as the preciousness [35] of lambs; they shalt be consumed into
   smoke. [36] 21. The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again; but the
   righteous is merciful, and giveth. 22. For those who are blessed by him
   shall inherit the earth; and those who are cursed of him shall be cut
   off.


   20 For the wicked shall perish. The causal particle ky, ki, which is
   here translated for, might also be rendered as if used adversatively by
   but or although, unless, perhaps, some would prefer to expound the
   sentence as of much higher import. But the preferable interpretation
   is, that there is here a contrast between the subjects spoken of,
   namely, that the righteous are satisfied in the time of famine, whereas
   the ungodly shall perish in the midst of their affluence; for, while
   they trust in their abundance, God brings them to nought by the use of
   means that are secret and hidden. In calling them the enemies of
   Jehovah, he teaches us, that they are justly overwhelmed by his
   vengeance, which they bring upon themselves by their own wickedness.
   When he says, that they shall be consumed as the excellency of lambs,
   this is understood by some to refer to the fat of them. But as ykr,
   yakar, signifies excellency, as I have said elsewhere, I have no doubt
   that this expression denotes the very best of lambs, and such as are of
   extraordinary fatness: and this is very suitable to the contrast here
   stated. We learn from this what another prophet likewise teaches, that
   the ungodly are fattened for the day of slaughter; so that the more
   sumptuously they shall have lived, the more suddenly shall their
   destruction come upon them. To be consumed into smoke is of the same
   import as to vanish away quickly; as if it had been said, There is no
   stability or substance in them. Those who understand the term yqr,
   yakar, to mean fat, explain this latter clause in this sense: that the
   wicked are consumed into smoke as fat melts or wastes away. [37] But
   the reader will see that the first interpretation is better.

   21 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again Those are mistaken who
   suppose that the wicked are here blamed for their treachery in carrying
   off the goods of others by fraud and deception; and that, on the other
   hand, the children of God are commended for their kindness in being
   always ready to relieve the wants of their poorer brethren. The prophet
   rather extols, on the one hand, the blessing of God towards the godly;
   and declares, on the other, that the ungodly never have enough. The
   meaning therefore is, that God deals bountifully with his own people,
   that they may be able to aid others; but that the ungodly are always in
   want, so that their poverty leads them to have recourse to fraud and
   rapine. And were we not blinded by insensibility and indifference, we
   could not fail to perceive the many proofs of this which are daily
   presented to our view. However great the abundance of the ungodly, yet
   their covetousness is so insatiable, that, like robbers, they plunder
   right and left, and yet are never able to pay; [38] while God bestows
   upon his own people a sufficiency not only for the supply of their own
   ordinary wants, but also to enable them to aid others. I do not indeed
   deny, that the wicked are reproved for wasteful extravagance, by which
   they defraud their creditors of what is their due, and also that the
   righteous are praised for applying to a proper use the bounty of God;
   but the design of the prophet is to show the high value of the divine
   blessing. This is confirmed by the following verse, in which he
   illustrates the difference resulting from the blessing and the curse of
   God. It then it is asked, whence the children of God are able to
   relieve the wants of the needy, and to exercise liberality towards
   them? and why it is that the ungodly are continually contracting debts
   from which they are never able to extricate themselves? David answers,
   that the former are blessed of the Lord, and that the latter are
   brought to utter ruin by his curse. Some expound the word mvrkyv,
   meborakayv, actively, as if it were, Those who bless the righteous
   shall possess, etc.; [39] but this is constrained and absurd. The
   meaning is simply this, that whatever we need for the preservation and
   maintenance of life, and for the exercise of humanity towards others,
   comes to us neither from the heavens nor from the earth, but only from
   the favor and blessing of God; and that if he once withdraw his grace,
   the abundance of the whole world would not satisfy us.

   [37] It is generally supposed that there is here an allusion to the

   offered in large numbers as burnt-offerings; and if the allusion is to
   these sacrifices, as is highly probable, the doctrine taught is, that
   as the fat of them melted away, and was wholly and rapidly consumed by
   the fire of the altar of burnt-offering, so the wicked shall melt away
   and be quickly consumed in the fire of Jehovah's wrath. The Chaldee
   paraphrases the last clause thus: -- "They shall be consumed in the

   Psalm 37:23-26

   23. The footsteps of a man are directed by Jehovah, and he will delight
   [or, take pleasure] in his way. 24. Though he fall, he shall not be
   utterly cast down: for Jehovah upholdeth him with his hand. 25. I have
   been young, I am also become old; and yet I have not seen the righteous
   forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. 26. He is daily merciful, and
   lendeth, and his seed is for blessing.


   23 The footsteps of a man are directed by Jehovah Some join together
   these two things, first, that the footsteps of the godly are ordered by
   the grace of God, since men do not in their own strength follow what is
   just and right, but only in so far as the Spirit of God directs them;
   and hence the second follows, namely, that God favors and approves what
   is his own. But David simply continues his commendation of the divine
   blessing towards the faithful, of whom this is especially worthy of
   being remembered, that whatever they undertake always has a favorable
   and happy result. At the same time, the reason why God crowns with
   prosperity and success all our efforts throughout the course of our
   life is to be observed, namely, because we attempt nothing which is not
   pleasing to him. For I consider the copula and, in the second clause of
   the verse, to be used instead of the causal particle because, and
   resolve the whole verse in this way: Because the way of the godly is
   acceptable to God, he directs their footsteps to a happy issue; so that
   the meaning is, As God sees that the faithful act conscientiously, and
   do not turn aside from the way which he has appointed, he blesses their
   efforts. And, certainly, since the prophet speaks generally -- and yet
   it is certain that the faithful only are here spoken of -- the second
   clause must necessarily be considered as spoken by way of exposition.
   Accordingly, the term way denotes their manner and course of living; as
   if he had said, that the godly have no other object in view but to
   frame their lives agreeably to the will of God, and to obey what he
   commands. The term footsteps I consider as referring to external
   success.

   24 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down This verse has
   generally been interpreted proverbially, and as meaning, that though
   the righteous may fall into sin, his fall is not deadly; but this is
   not at all in accordance with the design of the prophet, who is
   discoursing of the happiness of the godly. The simple meaning is, that
   when God visits his servants with severe afflictions, he at the same
   time mitigates them that they may not faint under them; [40] as Paul
   declares,

   "We are persecuted, but not forsaken;
   cast down, but not destroyed."-- (2 Corinthians 4:9)

   Some say that the righteous are not utterly cast down, because they
   lose not their courage, but rather bear with invincible fortitude
   whatever burden is laid upon them. I readily admit that the reason why
   they are not overwhelmed is, that they are not so tender and delicate
   as to sink under the burden. I, however, understand the words in a more
   extensive sense, and explain them thus: That the miseries of the godly
   are so tempered with God's fatherly mercy, that they fail not under
   their burden, and even when they fall, sink not into destruction. From
   these words we learn that the godly, although they serve God sincerely,
   and study to lead a blameless life, are not suffered to continue
   unmoved, and always in the same condition, but are often afflicted and
   cast down by various trials; and that the only difference between them
   and the unbelieving is, that their falls are not deadly. We know that
   if God smite the reprobate, though it be but very slightly, it becomes
   the cause of their final destruction. Solomon speaks still more
   expressly when he says,

   "For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again,"
   (Proverbs 24:16,)

   and by these words he teaches us, that the godly are not only subjected
   to frequent afflictions in this life, but that they are visited with
   daily trials, and yet are never forsaken of the Lord. We must also
   shortly observe, that even the slightest fall would be enough to
   destroy us utterly, did not God uphold us by his hand.

   25 I have been young, I am also become old. The meaning of these words
   is not in the least doubtful, namely, that David, even when he was
   become an old man, had not seen any of the righteous, or any of their
   children, begging their bread. But here there arises a question of some
   difficulty with respect to the fact stated; for it is certain that many
   righteous men have been reduced to beggary. And what David here
   declares as the result of his own experience pertains to all ages.
   Besides, he refers in this verse to the writings of Moses, for in
   Deuteronomy 15:4, begging is reckoned among the curses of God; and the
   law, in that place, expressly exempts from it those who fear and serve
   God. How then does the consistency of this appear, that none of the
   righteous ever begged his bread, since Christ placed Lazarus among the
   most abject of them? (Luke 16:20.) I answer, that we must bear in mind
   what I have before said upon this subject, that with respect to the
   temporal blessings which God confers upon his people, no certain or
   uniform rule can be established. There are various reasons why God does
   not manifest his favor equally to all the godly in this world. He
   chastises some, while he spares others: he heals the secret maladies of
   some, and passes by others, because they have no need of a like remedy:
   he exercises the patience of some, according as he has given them the
   spirit of fortitude; and, finally, he sets forth others by way of
   example. But in general, he humbles all of them by the tokens of his
   anger, that by secret warnings they may be brought to repentance.
   Besides, he leads them, by a variety of afflictions, to fix their
   thoughts in meditation upon the heavenly life; and yet it is not a vain
   or imaginary thing, that, as is set forth in the Law, God vouchsafes
   earthly blessings to his servants as proofs of his favor toward them. I
   confess, I say, that it is not in vain, or for nought, that an
   abundance of earthly blessings, sufficient for the supply of all their
   wants, is promised to the godly. This, however, is always to be
   understood with this limitation, that God will bestow these blessings
   only in so far as he shall consider it expedient: and, accordingly, it
   may happen that the blessing of God may be manifested in the life of
   men in general, and yet some of the godly be pinched with poverty,
   because it is for their good. But if it happen that any of the faithful
   are brought to beggary, they should lift up their minds on high, to
   that blessed state in which God will largely recompense them for all
   that is now wanting in the blessings of this transitory life. We must
   also bear this in mind, that if God sometimes involve the faithful in
   the same punishments by which he takes vengeance upon the ungodly --
   seeing them, for example, affected with the same diseases, -- in doing
   so there is no inconsistency; for although they do not come the length
   of contemning God, nor are devoted to wickedness, nor even act
   according to their own inclination, nor yield themselves wholly to the
   influence of sin like the wicked, yet are they not free of all blame;
   and, therefore, it need not surprise us though they are sometimes
   subjected to temporal punishments. We are, however, certain of this,
   that God makes such provision for his own people, that, being contented
   with their lot, they are never in want; because, by living sparingly,
   they always have enough, as Paul says, Philippians 6:12,

   "I am instructed both to abound and to suffer need."

   26 He is daily merciful The Psalmist here repeats what he had already
   said, that the grace of God is a fountain of all blessings which can
   never be exhausted; and, therefore, while it is displayed towards the
   faithful, they not only have enough for the supply of their own wants,
   but are able also liberally to assist others. What he adds concerning
   their seed is variously expounded. That he is speaking of the children
   of the godly, there can be no doubt; and this is evident from the
   preceding verse. But when he says that they shall be for blessing, [41]
   some understand it as if he had said, They shall be the ministers of
   God's liberality: so that, according to them, the sense would be, that
   they shall follow the good example of their fathers in helping the
   poor, and in exercising liberality towards all men. But I fear that
   this exposition is too refined. Nor do I admit the interpretation which
   has been given by others, that the meaning is, that the grace of God
   shall be so signally manifested towards the children of the godly, that
   their names shall be employed in a form of prayer, when prosperity and
   success are prayed for. This mode of expression, I allow, is to be so
   understood in various places; but here, in my opinion, David designs
   nothing more than to extol the continuation of God's favor from the
   fathers to their children: as if he had said, God's blessing does not
   terminate with the death of the righteous man, but it extends even to
   his children. [42] And there is indeed no inheritance more certain to
   which our children may succeed us, than when God, receiving them in
   like manner into his fatherly favor, makes them partakers of his
   blessing.

   Psalm 37:27-29

   27. Depart from evil, and do good, and dwell for ever. 28. For Jehovah
   loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his meek ones: they shall be
   preserved for ever: and the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. 29.
   The righteous shall inherit the earth, and shall dwell for ever upon
   it.


   27 Depart from evil, and do good. In this verse David argues, that, in
   order to realize the blessedness of which he has spoken, we must
   abstain from all evil, perform the duties of humanity, and exert
   ourselves in doing good to our neighbors. This doctrine is at variance
   with the dictates of corrupt human nature; but it is, notwithstanding,
   certain that many of the troubles and distresses in which the whole
   human race are involved, proceed from no other cause than this, that
   every man respectively, in his own sphere, being given to injustice,
   fraud, extortion, and evil-dealing, contemptuously rejects the blessing
   of God. Thus, it is in consequence of the barriers which men throw in
   their own way, that they do not attain happiness in this world, and
   that every man in his own place does not possess the peace and
   quietness which belong to him. It is then with the highest propriety
   that David passes from the doctrine of the preceding context to this
   exhortation: for if the meek possess the earth, then every one, as he
   regards his own happiness and peace, ought also to endeavor to walk
   uprightly, and to apply himself to works of beneficence. It should also
   be observed, that he connects these two things, first, that the
   faithful should strictly do good; and, secondly, that they should
   restrain themselves from doing evil: and this he does not without good
   reason: for as we have seen in the thirty-fourth psalm, it often
   happens that the same person who not only acts kindly towards certain
   persons, but even with a bountiful hand deals out largely of his own,
   is yet all the while plundering others, and amassing by extortion the
   resources by means of which he displays his liberality. Whoever,
   therefore, is desirous to have his good offices approved by God, let
   him endeavor to relieve his brethren who have need of his help, but let
   him not injure one in order to help another, or afflict and grieve one
   in order to make another glad. Now David, under these two expressions,
   has briefly comprised the duties of the second table of the law: first,
   that the godly should keep their hands free from all mischief, and give
   no occasion of complaint to any man; and, secondly, that they should
   not live to themselves, and to the promotion merely of their own
   private interests, but should endeavor to promote the common good of
   all according to their opportunities, and as far as they are able. But
   we have already said, that the blessing which is promised to the
   righteous, that "they shall inherit the earth," is not always realised
   in an equal degree as to all the people of God; and the reason we
   assigned for this is, that God cannot find among men an example of such
   great uprightness, but that even the most perfect procure to themselves
   much misery by their own fault: and therefore it need not surprise us
   though God withdraw, at least in some measure, his blessing even from
   his own. We know too to what excess the lusts of the flesh run riot,
   unless the Lord lay a restraint upon them. Besides, there is no one who
   is ready cheerfully to engage in meditation upon the divine life, who
   is not urged and encouraged to it by various motives. Hence it is that
   the possession of the earth, which David here assigns to the children
   of God, does not (as the lawyers would define the term) always consist
   in having the feet planted within it, and in being securely established
   in it; for there are many sources of disquietude and affliction here to
   trouble them. And yet it does not follow that it is a mere fiction or
   imaginary thing which he promises. For although daily experience shows
   us that the children of God do not as yet inherit the earth, yet,
   according to the measure of our faith, we feel how efficacious the
   blessing of God is, which, like a spring that cannot be drained, flows
   continually. They are indeed more than blind who do not perceive that
   the righteous have at present this reward, that God defends and upholds
   them by his power.

   28 For Jehovah loveth judgement. This, it ought to be observed, is a
   confirmation of the doctrine contained in the preceding sentence; and
   it is here made to rest upon a higher principle, namely, that God takes
   pleasure in righteousness and truth. The argument indeed appears to be
   incomplete; but as David takes for granted -- what ought to be deeply
   fixed in the hearts of all the faithful -- that the world is directed
   by the providence of God, his conclusion is admirable. In the first
   place, then, it must be admitted that the condition of the human race
   is not under the direction of chance, but of the providence of God, and
   that the world is conducted and governed by his counsel: so that he
   regulates according to his pleasure the issue of all things, and
   controls them by his power; and, secondly, to this it must be added
   what David here states, that righteousness and truth are pleasing to
   God. Hence it follows, that all who lead an upright and blameless life
   among men shall be happy, because, enjoying the favor of God, every
   thing at length must in regard to them have a happy and successful
   result. But let us bear in mind, that the promise which is spoken of in
   this verse is to be understood in this sense, that while God has
   undertaken the preservation of the godly, it is not to cherish them
   continually in retirement and ease, but after he has for a time
   exercised them under the cross, at length to come to their help: for
   the language here employed, Jehovah forsaketh not his meek ones, is
   tacitly very emphatic. Those, therefore, who separate the exercise of
   patience from the favor which God bestows upon the godly in this life,
   misinterpret this psalm. On the contrary, lest any one should hastily
   and rashly pronounce judgment, the prophet entreats the faithful to
   suspend their judgment, until God manifest his displeasure after the
   death of the wicked, in inflicting punishment upon their posterity: The
   seed of the wicked shall be cut off This is of the same import as if he
   had again asserted, that although the judgements of God are not
   immediately executed upon the wicked and ungodly, yet they are not on
   that account anything the better of it, since the punishment justly due
   to them will extend to their children. If then the curse of God is not
   forthwith inflicted upon them, it need not surprise us if he delay for
   a time to manifest the favor which he bears towards the faithful.

   29 The righteous shall inherit the earth The repetition of the same
   doctrine here is not superfluous, since it is so very difficult to
   impress it deeply upon our minds. For while all men seek after
   happiness, scarcely one in a hundred looks for it from God, but rather
   all, on the contrary, in making provision for themselves, provoke the
   vengeance of God, as it were deliberately, and strive to excel each
   other in doing so, so that some of them stain themselves with fraud and
   perjury, some indulge in robbery and extortion, some practice all sorts
   of cruelty, and others commit violence and outrage even with the sword
   and poison. Moreover, I have just now, and on several other occasions,
   stated the sense in which this everlasting habitation upon the earth,
   which is here promised to the righteous, is to be understood, namely,
   that although they are surrounded by the troubles and changes which
   occur in this world, yet God preserves them under his wings; and
   although there is nothing lasting or stable under heaven, yet he keeps
   them in safety as if they were sheltered in a secure haven. And,
   finally, they enjoy in addition to this that inward peace of mind which
   is better than a hundred lives, and which is therefore justly regarded
   as a privilege surpassing in value and importance all others.

   Psalm 37:30-33

   30. The mouth of the righteous will speak wisdom, and his tongue will
   utter judgment. 31. The law of his God is in his heart: his steps shall
   not slide. 32. The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay
   him. 33. Jehovah will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when
   he is judged.


   30 The mouth of the righteous will speak wisdom As it is customary with
   hypocrites confidently to draw to their own advantage whatever the
   Spirit of God declares concerning the just and upright, David here
   gives a definition of the righteousness which God requires on the part
   of his children, and divides it into three principal parts -- that
   their speech should be in sincerity and truth; that the law of God
   should reign in their heart; and that they should order their
   conversation aright. Some give a different exposition of the first part
   from what we have given: they say that the righteous serve as teachers
   and guides, by instructing others to live well, and leading them in the
   way; and, therefore, to speak wisdom, and to utter judgment, is, in
   their view, of the same import as to instruct others in holy doctrine,
   and to train them to the fear of God. I do not altogether disapprove of
   this exposition, but I fear it is too restricted. Wisdom and
   uprightness are here opposed as much to the profane and filthy language
   by which the wicked endeavor to blot out the name of God, as to cunning
   and fraud, and every species of stratagem and deceit; and also to the
   threats and terrors by which they endeavor to frighten the simple. [43]
   The meaning therefore is, first, that the righteous speak honourably
   and reverently of the righteousness of God, that they may cherish in
   themselves and others, to a large extent, the knowledge and the fear of
   God; [44] secondly, that both in their own affairs and those of others,
   they approve, without disguise or deceit, of what is just and
   reasonable, and are not given to justify what is wrong under the color
   and varnish of sophistry; and, finally, that they never depart from the
   truth.

   To this there is added integrity of heart: The law of the Lord is in
   his heart. This, though it should precede in point of order, is not
   improperly put in the second place here. For the Scriptures are not
   particular in observing an exact arrangement in the enumeration of
   virtues and vices. Besides, the source whence this integrity of heart
   proceeds is, that the Law of God has its seat in the heart; and it is
   it alone which prescribes the best rule of life, restrains all the
   depraved affections and lusts, and imbues the minds of men with the
   love of righteousness. No man will constantly and steadily devote
   himself to a life of uprightness, exert himself in behalf of others in
   preference to his own personal interests, renounce covetousness, subdue
   pride, and maintain a constant warfare with his own nature, unless he
   is endued with the fear of God. There next follows the third division,
   which relates to the external conduct: His steps shall not slide Some,
   indeed, think that this is a promise; but I have no doubt, that in this
   clause David still continues the definition of righteousness. The
   meaning therefore is, that although the children of God are tempted in
   a variety of ways to commit sin, and many things occur urging them to
   it, -- and although men, for the most part, too, endeavor, as far as in
   them lies, by their maliciousness to turn them aside from the fear of
   God, -- yet, because the Law of God rules and reigns in their hearts,
   they do not slide, but stand to their purpose with firm and determined
   resolution, or at least adhere to the right course.

   32. and 33. The wicked watcheth the righteous, etc. David here
   illustrates more plainly the nature of the possession of the earth, of
   which he had spoken, namely, that God preserves his own people, though
   they are beset with enemies round about. And hence we are again taught,
   that the faithful are not promised in the preceding context a quiet
   state of life, and one free from all trouble and distress. If so, these
   two statements would be contradictory: first, that the faithful
   possessing an inheritance, enjoy repose and pleasure; and, secondly,
   that yet they are daily delivered as sheep out of the mouth of wolves.
   These two verses, however, contain this special ground of consolation,
   that the faithful, though surrounded by such a variety of dangers,
   shall notwithstanding escape, and be preserved in safety by the help of
   God. Accordingly, David here teaches them, that when they shall see
   their enemies lying in wait for them, and seeking by every means in
   their power to annoy them, they, on the contrary, ought to consider how
   deeply interested God is in the welfare of his own people, and how
   carefully he watches over them to preserve them in safety. David indeed
   confesses that the stratagems to which the wicked have recourse in
   seeking not only to deprive good men of their property, but even to
   take away their lives, are terrible in themselves, because they cruelly
   plot their destruction; but still he teaches us at the same time, that
   we ought to continue to preserve firm and undaunted courage, because
   God has promised that he will be our guardian and defender: Jehovah
   will not leave him in his hand This circumstance, however, ought to be
   considered, that God does not always grant us deliverance at the first,
   but often delays it till we seem to be even at the point of death. In
   the last clause of the verse, we are also admonished, that however
   carefully good men may guard against giving offense to any, and
   endeavor to secure the good-will of all, and shun debate and strife,
   yet they shall not be exempted from false accusations: Jehovah will not
   condemn them when they are judged David does not say that they shall
   receive the applause of the world, and that their virtues shall be
   celebrated in such praises as they deserve; but he exhorts them, when
   they shall be haled to judgment, and as it were overwhelmed with
   slander, so that they already resemble those who are condemned, to rest
   contented with the protection of God, who will at length manifest their
   innocence, and maintain it against the unrighteous judgments of men. If
   any one object, that, on the contrary, many of the children of God,
   after having been condemned, have suffered a cruel and bitter death, I
   answer, that their avenger nevertheless is in heaven. Christ was put to
   death in the most cruel form, and in circumstances of the deepest
   ignominy, but notwithstanding, as the prophet Isaiah says, Isaiah 53:8,
   "he was taken from that distress and condemnation;" and in the same
   manner God is still acting daily towards those who are his members. If
   it may still be objected, that David is here discoursing not of the
   life to come, but of the state of the godly in the present life, I must
   again repeat in answer to this, the explanation which I have given
   before, namely, that earthly blessings are at God's disposal, and are
   regulated entirely according to his will; and hence it is that he never
   bestows them in an equal measure upon all, but according to his wisdom,
   and as he sees meet, sometimes withdrawing them either in whole or in
   part, and at other times displaying them to the view of all.
   Accordingly, it may happen, that the holy martyrs, after they have been
   condemned, may also be put to death, as if God had forsaken them; but
   this is only because it is better for themselves, and because they
   desire nothing more than to glorify God by their death. Yet he who
   permits the ungodly to exercise their cruelty, ceases not to be the
   assertor of the righteousness of his servants: for he openly shows
   before his angels, and before his whole Church, that he approves it,
   and declares that he will make inquisition for it; nay, more, raising
   them from the darkness in which they have been hid, he makes their
   ashes yield a sweet and pleasant odour. Finally, after the Lord has
   suffered them to be overwhelmed by reproach and violence, he will
   pronounce the judgment by which he will vindicate their righteous cause
   from wicked calumnies and false accusations.

   Psalm 37:34-36

   34. Wait upon Jehovah, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee, that
   thou mayest inherit the earth: when the wicked are cut off thou shalt
   see it. 35. I have seen the wicked terrible, [45] and spreading himself
   like a green bay tree: [46] 36. And he passed away, [47] and, lo! he
   was not: and I sought for his place, and he was not found.


   34 Wait upon Jehovah, and keep his way David again returns to the style
   of exhortation, in order that the faithful, trusting to God's promises
   and sustained by them, may not suffer themselves to be drawn hither and
   thither by any temptations through devious and sinful ways, but may
   persevere steadfastly in the service of God. In the first place, he
   exhorts them to hope and patience, as if he wished them, amidst the
   tumults and troubles of life, to trust in God, and hold their peace
   till he again show them his countenance, which for a time he had hid
   from them. Hence arises, in the second place, another exhortation, that
   they should not turn aside from the way of the Lord; for wherever hope
   and patience prevail, they will so restrain the minds of men that they
   will not break out into any thing unlawful and wicked. It will
   doubtless be found, that the reason why every man endeavors to promote
   his own advantage by wicked practices is, that no one depends upon God,
   or else that he thinks, if fortune do not quickly smile upon him, that
   it is vain for him to persevere in the practice of equity and
   uprightness. Moreover, we may learn from this place, that if many, even
   of the good and the upright, are subjected to poverty, and lead a life
   of protracted affliction and trial, they suffer their punishment
   justly, because, so far from being firmly persuaded that it belongs to
   God as his proper office not only to lift up his servants from the
   dunghill, but also to bring them forth even from their graves, scarcely
   one in a hundred of them patiently waits upon God, and continues
   perseveringly in the right course. Nor is it without good reason that
   David makes use of the word exalt, that we may know that God often
   stretches forth his hand to the faithful when they appear to be
   overwhelmed by the weight of their calamities. He then adds, that the
   wicked shall perish before the eyes of the godly. If their end were not
   very different from that of the righteous, the state in which the
   reprobate now rejoice for a time would easily allure even the best of
   men to evil. And, indeed, God would make us daily to behold such sights
   if we had eyes to behold his judgments. And yet, although the whole
   world were blinded, God does not cease to render a just reward to the
   wickedness of men; but by punishing them in a more private manner, he
   withdraws from us that fruit of which our own dulness deprives us.

   35. and 36 I have seen the wicked terrible, etc. David here confirms
   from his own experience what I have just said, namely, that although
   the wicked are intoxicated with their prosperity, and held in
   admiration by all on account of it, yet their happiness is transitory
   and evanescent, and, therefore, nothing else than a mere illusion. In
   the 35th verse he tells us, that it is no strange or unwonted thing for
   the ungodly, puffed up with their prosperity, to spread themselves far
   and wide, and to give occasion of terror to the innocent. Then he adds,
   that their greatness, which had been regarded with so much wonder,
   disappears in a moment. As to the meaning of the words, ryph, arits,
   which we have rendered terrible, might also be translated strong,
   because the word from which it is derived signifies sometimes to
   terrify, and sometimes to strengthen. The word mtrh, mithareh, is taken
   by some for green, but it rather means discovering or spreading himself
   out, as high and broad trees spread out their branches. David, I have
   no doubt, here rebukes the insolence of those who vaunt themselves
   immoderately. To pass away, in the 36th verse, is used for to vanish
   away; and thus he admonishes us to sit still for a time, in order that
   it may appear, after it has passed away, that all that the world
   admires in the prosperity of the wicked has been only a mist.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [45] Striking terror in all around.

   [46] The proper signification of the word 'zrch, azrach, has been
   controverted among interpreters, and it has been variously rendered.
   Most of the Rabbins, and many modern commentators, as Mudge, Waterland,
   Gesenius, and others, are of opinion, that the preferable reading is,
   "like an indigenous or native tree;" that is, a tree which flourishes
   in its native soil, where it grows most vigorously, and acquires its
   largest and most luxuriant growth. The Septuagint translates it, os tas
   chedrous tou Libanou, "as the cedars of Lebanon;" being self-growing,
   spreading, and lofty trees. Some suppose that the translators of this
   version must have had a different reading in their Hebrew Bibles from
   what is in our present copies; and others that, as is common with them,
   they paraphrase the original words, the more clearly to express their
   meaning. The translation of the Septuagint is followed by the Vulgate,
   Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, by Houbigant, Boothroyd, Geddes, and
   other good authorities. Ainsworth reads, "as a green self-growing
   laurel." Bythner says he is at a loss for the reason of translating the
   word laurel. "For the reading of bay tree," says the illustrated
   Commentary upon the Bible, "we are not aware of any authority, except
   the very feeble one which is offered by some of the older of the modern
   versions in this country and on the Continent."

   [47] The Suptuagint, Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic versions, Jerome,
   Houbigant, Horsley, and Walford, read the verb in the first person,
   "But I passed by." The Chaldee adheres to the Hebrew, "And he passed,
   or failed, from the age, or world, and, lo! he was not."

   Psalm 37:37-40

   37. Observe the perfect man, and consider the just for the end of that
   man is peace. 38. But the transgressors shall be destroyed together:
   the end of the wicked shall be cut off. 39. The salvation of the
   righteous is from Jehovah: he is their strength in the time of trouble.
   40. Jehovah shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them
   from the wicked: he shall preserve them, because they trust in him.


   37 Observe the perfect man David exhorts the faithful diligently to
   consider every instance they may meet with of the grace of God, as well
   as of his judgment; but he teaches, at the same time, that it is in
   vain for any to sit in judgment upon the first aspect of things. When
   men do not wait patiently and quietly the time which God has appointed
   in his good pleasure, it often happens that faith is extinguished, and
   trust in the promises of God, at the same time, perishes with it. This
   is the reason why David exhorts us to observe and consider, for when
   our minds are preoccupied by the temptation which is once presented to
   our view, hasty judgment is then the cause of our being deceived. But
   if a man extend his view, as if it were from a watch-tower, to a great
   distance, he will find that it has been said with truth, that the end
   of the reprobate and the end of the righteous respectively are at
   length very different. This clause, with respect to the end of these
   two classes of men, seems to be added by way of caution, that we may
   learn to suspend our judgment, if God should not immediately accomplish
   what he has spoken. If we should become impatient in our desires, let
   us moderate our minds by the reflection, that the end is not yet come,
   and that it behoves us to give God time to restore to order the
   confused state of things. Some explain the word 'chryt, acharith, which
   we have rendered the end of the wicked, of their posterity. This,
   however, is incorrect. David refers only to the difference which
   subsists between them and the righteous in the end; for God, after he
   has severely tried his servants, and exercised their patience, in the
   end converts their adversity into a blessing, while he turns the mirth
   of the ungodly into mourning.

   39 The salvation of the righteous is from Jehovah The sum of the whole
   is, that whatever may happen, the righteous shall be saved, because
   they are in the hand of God, and can never be forgotten by him. This
   ought to be particularly noticed, that those who are greatly afflicted
   may be sustained by the assurance that the salvation which they expect
   from God is infallibly certain, because God is eternal, and governs the
   world by his power; as Christ said,

   "My Father, who gave them me, is greater than all,"
   (John 10:29.)

   David still inculcates this principle, that as righteousness is
   approved of God, it can never happen that he should forsake his
   faithful servants, and deprive them of his help. He, therefore, exhorts
   true believers to depend upon God, not only when things prosper
   according to their desires, but even when they are sorely afflicted. By
   these words he teaches that it is enough, if God only impart strength
   to his servants, so that, when severely afflicted and oppressed with
   anguish, they may not faint under it, or that, when groaning under the
   weight of severe afflictions, they may not sink under the burden. To
   the same purpose also is the expression which David uses twice in the
   last verse, that God will deliver By this he admonishes the children of
   God to learn patiently to endure afflictions, and that, if God should
   prolong them, they should often recall this to their remembrance, that
   after he has tried their patience, he will in the end deliver them.

   PSALM 38

   David, suffering under some severe and dangerous malady, as may be
   conjectured, acknowledges that he is chastened by the Lord, and
   entreats him to turn away his anger from him. In order the more
   effectually to induce God to have mercy upon him, he bewails before him
   the severity of his afflictions in a variety of particulars. These we
   shall consider separately, and in order.

   A Psalm of David to bring to remembrance. [48]

   The title of this psalm refers to its subject. Some suppose that it is
   the beginning of a common song, because in other psalms the beginning
   of the song, to the tune of which they were set, is commonly prefixed:
   but such an interpretation is unnatural, and without foundation.
   Instead of this, I rather think that the title indicates that David
   composed this psalm as a memorial for himself, as well as others, lest
   he should too soon forget the chastisement by which God had afflicted
   him. He knew how easily and speedily the chastisements with which God
   visits us, and which ought to serve as a means of instruction to us all
   our life, pass away from the mind. He was also mindful of his own high
   calling; for, as he was appointed master and teacher over the whole
   Church, it was necessary that whatever he had himself learned in
   particular by divine teaching should be made known, and appropriated to
   the use of all, that all might profit thereby. Thus we are admonished
   that it is a very profitable exercise often to recall to remembrance
   the chastisements with which God has afflicted us for our sins.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 38:1-5

   1. O Jehovah! rebuke me not in thy wrath, and chasten me not in thy
   anger. 2. For thy arrows go down in me [49] and thy hand has come down
   upon me. 3. There is no soundness in my flesh because of thy anger; nor
   any peace in my bones because of my sin. 4. For my iniquities have
   passed over my head, and as a weighty burden they have become too heavy
   for me. 5. My wounds have become putrid, they are corrupt, because of
   my foolishness.


   1 O Jehovah! rebuke me not in thy wrath As I have already expounded
   this verse in the beginning of the sixth psalm, where it occurs, and
   that I may not prove tedious to the reader, I shall notice it more
   briefly here. David does not expressly ask that his afflictions should
   be removed, but only that God would moderate the severity of his
   chastisements. Hence we may infer, that David did not give loose reins
   to the desires of the flesh, but offered up his earnest prayer in a
   duly chastened spirit of devotion. All men would naturally desire that
   permission should be granted them to sin with impunity. But David lays
   a restraint upon his desires, and does not wish the favor and
   indulgence of God to be extended beyond measure, but is content with a
   mitigation of his affliction; as if he had said, Lord, I am not
   unwilling to be chastised by thee, but I entreat thee, meanwhile, not
   to afflict me beyond what I am able to bear, but to temper the
   fierceness of thy indignation according to the measure of my infirmity,
   lest the severity of the affliction should entirely overwhelm me. This
   prayer, as I have said, was framed according to the rule of godliness;
   for it contains nothing but what God promises to all his children. It
   should also be noticed, that David does not secretly indulge a fretful
   and repining spirit, but spreads his complaint before God; and this he
   does, not in the way of sinful complaining, but of humble prayer and
   unfeigned confession, accompanied with the hope of obtaining
   forgiveness. He has used anger and wrath as denoting extreme rigour,
   and has contrasted them with fatherly chastisement.

   2. For thy arrows go down in me. He shows that he was constrained by
   dire necessity to ask an alleviation of his misery; for he was crushed
   under the weight of the burden which he sustained. This rule is always
   to be observed in our prayers -- to keep God's promises present to our
   view. But God has promised that he will chastise his servants, not
   according to their deserts, but as they are able to bear. This is the
   reason why the saints so often speak of their own weakness, when they
   are severely oppressed with affliction. David very properly describes
   the malady under which he labored, by the terms, the arrows and the
   hand, or the chastisement of God. Had he not been persuaded that it was
   God who thus afflicted him, he could never have been brought to seek
   from him deliverance from his affliction. We know that the great
   majority of men are blinded under the judgments of God, and imagine
   that they are entirely the events of chance; and scarcely one in a
   hundred discerns in them the hand of God. But, in his sickness, as in
   all his other adversities, David views the hand of God lifted up to
   punish him for his sins. And certainly, the man who estimates his
   affliction only by the feeling of pain which it produces, and views it
   in no other light, differs nothing from the beasts of the field. As
   every chastisement of God should remind us of his judgment, the true
   wisdom of the saints, as the prophet declares,

   "to look to the hand of him who smiteth."-- (Isaiah 9:13)

   The pronoun thy is therefore emphatic. David's words are, as if he had
   said, I have not to do with a mortal man, who can shoot his arrows with
   a force only in proportion to his own strength, but I have to do with
   God, who can discharge the arrows that come from his hand with a force
   altogether overwhelming.

   3. There is no soundness in my flesh because of thy anger Others
   translate, There is no beauty; but this does not seem to be so
   suitable. In the clause which follows, David ascribes to God the praise
   of righteousness, without which, the acknowledgement which he formerly
   made would be of little avail; nay, instead of this, such an
   acknowledgement sometimes rather exasperates the minds of men, so that
   they provoke the wrath of God still more, by charging him with cruelty,
   and pouring forth horrible blasphemies against him. Nothing, therefore,
   can be more preposterous, than to imagine that there is in God a power
   so supreme and absolute, (as it is termed,) as to deprive him of his
   righteousness. David, as soon as he recognised his affliction as coming
   from God, turns to his own sin as the cause of the Divine displeasure;
   for he had already been fully satisfied in his own mind, that he is not
   like a tyrant who exercises cruelty needlessly and at random, but a
   righteous judge, who never manifests his displeasure by inflicting
   judgments but when he is grievously offended. If, then, we would render
   to God the praise which is due to him, let us learn by the example of
   David to connect our sins with his wrath.

   4. For my iniquities have passed over my head. Here he complains that
   he is overwhelmed by his sins as by a heavy burden, so that he utterly
   faints under their weight; and yet he again confirms the doctrine which
   we have already stated, that he deservedly suffered the wrath of God,
   which had been inflicted on him in a manner so severe and dreadful. The
   word vn, avon, which we have translated iniquities, no doubt often
   signifies punishment, but this is only in a secondary and metaphorical
   sense. I am also willing to admit, that David assigns to the effect
   what is proper to the cause, when he describes by the appellation
   iniquities, the punishment which he had procured by his own sin; and
   yet his object at the same time is plainly and distinctly to confess,
   that all the afflictions which he suffered were to be imputed to his
   sins. He quarrels not with God for the extreme severity of his
   punishment, as Cain did, who said,

   "My punishment is greater than I can bear," (Genesis 4:13.)

   It is true, indeed, that Moses uses the same word vn, avon, in that
   passage, so that there is some similarity between the language of David
   and Cain. But David's meaning is very different. When such temptations
   as these were insinuating themselves into his mind, Could God afflict
   thee more severely than he does? certainly, since he is doing nothing
   to relieve thee, it is a sure sign that he wishes thee destroyed and
   brought to nought; he not only despises thy sighs and groanings, but
   the more he seeth thee cast down and forsaken, he pursueth thee the
   more fiercely and with the greater rigour; -- to preclude the entrance
   of such evil thoughts and surmisings, he defended himself as with a
   shield by this consideration, that he was afflicted by the just
   judgment of God. He has here attributed to his own sins as the cause
   the weight of the wrath of God which he felt; and, as we shall find in
   the following verse, he again acknowledges, that what he is now
   suffering was procured by his own foolishness. Although, then, in
   bewailing his own miseries, he may seem in some measure to quarrel with
   God, yet he still cherishes the humble conviction, (for God afflicteth
   not beyond measure,) that there is no rest for him but in imploring the
   Divine compassion and forgiveness; whereas the ungodly, although
   convicted by their own consciences of guilt, murmur against God, like
   the wild beasts, which, in their rage, gnaw the chains with which they
   are bound.

   5 My wounds [50] have become putrid In this verse, he pleads the long
   continuance of his disease as an argument for obtaining some
   alleviation. When the Lord declares, concerning his Church,

   "that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned,
   for she hath received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins,"
   (Isaiah 40:2)

   his meaning is, that when he has sufficiently chastised his people, he
   is quickly pacified towards them; nay, more, that if he continue to
   manifest his displeasure for too long a time, he becomes through his
   mercy, as it were, weary of it, so that he hastens to give deliverance,
   as he says in another place,

   "For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I
   refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off. Behold, I have refined thee,
   but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of
   affliction."-- (Isaiah 48:9, 10)

   The object, therefore, which David has in view, in complaining of the
   long continuance of his misery is, that when he had endured the
   punishment which he had merited, he might at length obtain deliverance.
   It was certainly no slight trial to this servant of God to be thus kept
   in continual languishing, and, as it were, to putrify and be dissolved
   into corruption in his miseries. In this his constancy is the more to
   be admired, for it neither broke down from the long period of delay,
   nor failed under the immense load of suffering. By using the term
   foolishness instead of sin, he does not seek in this way to extenuate
   his faults, as hypocrites do when they are unable to escape the charge
   of guilt; for in order to excuse themselves in part, they allege the
   false pretense of ignorance, pleading, and wishing it to be believed,
   that they erred through imprudence and inadvertence. But, according to
   a common mode of expression in the Hebrew language, by the use of the
   term foolishness, he acknowledges that he had been out of his right
   mind, when he obeyed the lusts of the flesh in opposition to God. The
   Spirit, by employing this term in so many places to designate crimes
   the most atrocious, does not certainly mean to extenuate the
   criminality of men, as if they were guilty merely of some slight
   offenses, but rather charges them with maniacal fury, because, blinded
   by unhallowed desires, they wilfully fly in the face of their Maker.
   Accordingly, sin is always conjoined with folly or, madness. It is in
   this sense that David speaks of his own foolishness; as if he had said,
   that he was void of reason and transported with madness, like the
   infatuated rage of wild beasts, when he neglected God and followed his
   own lusts.

   "Enepagesan moi" the Vulgate, "Infixae sunt mihi;" -- "Are fastened in
   me;" which is a natural consequence of entering deep, and rather
   expresses the meaning, than conveys the precise idea of the original
   word. The Syriac and Arabic versions give the same rendering with the
   Vulgate.

   Psalm 38:6-10

   6. I am bent, I am, bowed down beyond measure: I go mourning [literally
   black] all the day long, 7. For my reins are filled with burning, [or,
   inflammation [51] ] and there is no soundness in my flesh. 8. I am very
   feeble and sore broken: I have roared because of the roaring of my
   heart. 9. O Lord! [52] thou knowest all my desire, and my groaning is
   not hid from thee. 10. My heart hath turned round, my strength hath
   failed me: and as for the light of my eyes, it also is gone from me.


   6 I am bent This description clearly shows that this holy man was
   oppressed with extreme grief, so much so, that it is marvellous how,
   under such a vast accumulation of miseries, his faith was sufficiently
   strong to bear up his mind. When he says bowed down, he seems tacitly
   to contrast his humility and dejection with the pride and stubbornness
   of many, who refuse to be humbled by the many chastisements with which
   God afflicts them, but rather harden themselves, daring to resist and
   oppose him. They must, no doubt, of necessity, feel the pain of their
   afflictions, but they fall into such a state of insensibility, that
   they are not affected by it. David then, from this circumstance, draws
   an argument to induce his heavenly Judge to have compassion on him,
   showing that he was not one of those who obstinately rebel against him,
   and refuse to bow in humble submission, even while the hand of God is
   upon them; but that he is abased and humbled, even as the Apostle Peter
   exhorts all the godly to

   "humble themselves under the mighty hand of God."
   (1 Peter 5:6)

   Let us therefore learn, that there is no other way by which we can
   obtain consolation under our afflictions, than by laying aside all
   stubbornness and pride, and humbly submitting to the chastisement of
   God. The word kvdr, koder, which I have translated black, is rendered
   by others clad in black, [53] and explained as referring to the outward
   apparel, the black color of which has always been a token of grief. But
   the opinion of those who understand it of the blackness of the skin is
   more correct; for we know that grief renders men's countenances lean,
   wan, and black. David, therefore, by this token of grief, describes the
   greatness of his affliction, because the natural color of his face had
   faded, and he was like a corpse, already withered and shrunk.

   In the next verse, the word kslym, kesalaim, which I have rendered
   reins, is by some translated the flanks. But the more generally
   received opinion is, that it denotes the part under the reins, which
   extends towards the haunch, or the space between the thighs and flanks,
   where it is supposed there had been a sore. Commentators also differ in
   their opinion respecting the word nqlh, nikleh, which I have rendered
   burning In my translation I have followed those who adhere to the
   original meaning of the word; for the verb qlh, kalah, signifies to
   burn, or to consume with fire. Others, indeed, explain it not
   improperly in the sense of filthiness and corruption. I am, however,
   not inclined to limit it to a sore. In my opinion, the sense simply is,
   that his reins, or flanks, or thighs, were filled with an inflammatory
   disease, or at least were covered over with putrid sores; for these
   parts of the body are most subject to inflammation, and most liable to
   contract putrid humours. Some expound it allegorically, as meaning,
   that David seemed loathsome in his own eyes, when he thought of his
   reproach; but this appears too forced. When he adds that he was
   weakened and sore broken, he still farther confirms what he had said in
   the preceding verses: for by these various terms he wished to express
   the intolerable vehemence of his grief. Now, as a man, who is
   distinguished by courage, does not cry out and complain, and as we know
   that David did not shrink in bearing his afflictions, we may gather
   from this, that his sufferings were severe and painful in the extreme,
   inasmuch as he not only wept bitterly, but was also forced to cry out
   and complain. The noun nhmt, nahamath, which I have rendered roaring,
   may be derived from another verb than that which David has here used;
   but the meaning is obvious, namely, that the incontrollable emotions of
   his heart forced him to cry out.

   9 O Lord! thou knowest all my desire. He adds this, not so much in
   respect of God, as to strengthen himself in the hope of obtaining some
   alleviation of his trouble, and thus to animate himself to persevering
   prayer. It may be explained in a twofold sense, either as denoting his
   confident assurance that his prayers and groanings were heard by the
   Lord, or a simple declaration that he had poured out before God all his
   cares and troubles; but the meaning is substantially the same: for as
   long as men entertain any doubt whether their groanings have come up
   before God, they are kept in constant disquietude and dread, which so
   fetters and holds captive their minds, that they cannot elevate their
   souls to God. On the contrary, a firm persuasion that our groanings do
   not vanish away in their ascent to God, but that he graciously hears
   them, and familiarly listens to them, produces promptitude and alacrity
   in engaging in prayer. It might, therefore, prove no small ground of
   encouragement to David, that he approached God, not with a doubting and
   trembling heart, but strengthened and encouraged by the assurance of
   which we have spoken, and of which he himself speaks in another place,
   that his tears were laid up in God's bottle, (Psalm 56:8.) In order
   that we may obtain access to God, we must believe that he is "a
   rewarder of them that diligently seek him," as the apostle states in
   his Epistle to the Hebrews, (Hebrews 11:6.) But I rather approve of the
   other interpretation, That David here declares that he had disburdened
   all his sorrows into the bosom of God. The reason why the greater part
   of men derive no profit from complaining grievously in their sorrow is,
   that they direct not their prayers and sighs to God. David, then, in
   order to encourage himself in the assured conviction that God will be
   his deliverer, says, that he had always been a witness of his sorrows,
   and was well acquainted with them, because he had neither indulged in a
   fretful spirit, nor poured out into the air his complaints and howlings
   as the unbelieving are wont to do, but had spread out before God
   himself all the desires of his heart.

   10 My heart hath turned round The verb which David here uses signifies
   to travel or wander hither and thither; but here it is taken for the
   agitation or disquietude which distress of heart engenders when we know
   not what to do. According as men are disquieted in mind, so do they
   turn themselves on all sides, and so their heart may be said to turn
   round, or to run to and fro. But since faith, when it has once brought
   us into obedience to God, holds our minds fixed on his word, it might
   here be asked by way of objection, How it is that the heart of David
   was so affected by disquietude and trouble? To this I answer, That
   although he continued to walk in the ways of God, while he was
   sustained by the promises of God, yet he was not altogether exempted
   from human infirmity. And, indeed, it will always happen, that as soon
   as we fall into some danger, our flesh will suggest to us various
   shifts and devices, and lead us into many errors in search of counsel;
   so that even the most confident would fail and go astray, unless he
   laid upon himself the same restraint by which David was preserved and
   kept in subjection, namely, by keeping all his thoughts shut up within
   the limits of God's word. Nay, even in the prayers which we offer up
   when our minds are at ease, we experience too well how easily our minds
   are carried away, and wander after vain and frivolous thoughts, and how
   difficult it is to keep them uninterruptedly attentive and fixed with
   the same degree of intensity upon the object of our desire. If this
   happen when we are not exercised by any severe trial, what will be the
   case when we are agitated by violent storms and tempests which threaten
   a thousand deaths, and when there is no way to escape them? It is,
   therefore, no great wonder if they carried away the heart of David, so
   that it was subject to various emotions amidst such tempestuous
   agitations. He adds, that his strength had failed him, as if he had
   compared himself to a dead man. What he adds concerning the light of
   his eyes some understand as if he had said, that he was so much
   oppressed with despair on all sides, that no counsel or foresight was
   left to him. The more simple meaning, however, is, that the light of
   life was taken away from him, because in it the energy of the soul
   principally shows itself.

   Psalm 38:11-14

   11. My friends and my companions stand away from my sore; and my
   kinsfolk stand afar off. 12. They also that sought for my life have
   laid snares for me; and they that sought after my hurt have talked of
   treachery, and imagine deceit daily. 13. But I, as a deaf man, hear
   not; and am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. 14. And I was as
   a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.


   11 My friends and my companions stand away from my sore Here David
   enumerates other circumstances to show the aggravated character of his
   misery, that he might excite the compassion of God. One of these is,
   that he finds no help or solace among men. In saying that his friends
   stand away from him, he means, that they cease from performing any of
   the offices of humanity towards him. This might happen either from
   pride or fear. If they withdrew from this poor afflicted man because
   they despised him, they were cruel and proud; and if they refused him
   their assistance for fear of being brought into odium, it was most
   unpardonable cowardice. But in the meantime, it augmented not a little
   the calamity of David, that even his friends and kinsfolk dared not to
   show any token of compassion towards him. It is, indeed, a very sore
   trial, when a man, who has had a great number of friends, comes to be
   abandoned by them all.

   12 They also that sought for my life have laid snares for me, etc..
   Here another circumstance is added, that the enemies of David laid
   snares for him, and talked about his destruction, and framed deceits
   among themselves. [54] The purport of what is stated is, that while his
   friends cowardly sit still and will do nothing to aid him, his enemies
   vigorously bestir themselves, and seek by every means to destroy him.
   He says that they seek his life, for as they were his deadly enemies
   and blood-thirsty men, they were not content with doing him some common
   injury, but furiously sought his destruction. He, however, here
   complains not so much that they assailed him by force of arms and with
   violence, as he accuses them of guileful conspiracy, which he
   designates in the first place metaphorically by the term snares, and
   afterwards adds in plain terms, that they talk about his destruction,
   and secretly consult among themselves how they might do him hurt. Now,
   as it is certain that David borrows not an artificial rhetoric from the
   bar, (as profane orators [55] do when they plead their cause,) in order
   to win the favor of God, but rather draws his arguments from the Word
   of God, the sentences which he here brings together for the
   confirmation of his faith we ought to appropriate to our own use. If we
   are altogether destitute of human aid and assistance, if our friends
   fail us in the time of need, and if others seek our ruin, and breathe
   out nothing but destruction against us, let us remember that it is not
   in vain for us to lay these things in prayer before God, whose province
   it is to succor those who are in misery, to take under his protection
   those who are perfidiously forsaken and betrayed, to restrain the
   wicked, and not only to withstand their violence, but also to
   anticipate their deceitful counsels and to frustrate their designs.

   13 But I, as a deaf man, hear not, etc. The inspired writer here
   compares himself to a dumb and deaf man, for two reasons. In the first
   place, he intimates that he was so overwhelmed with the false and
   wicked judgments of his enemies, that he was not even permitted to open
   his mouth in his own defense. In the second place, he alleges before
   God his own patience, as a plea to induce God the more readily to have
   pity upon him; for such meekness and gentleness, not only with good
   reason, secures favor to the afflicted and the innocent, but it is also
   a sign of true piety. Those who depend upon the world, and have respect
   only to men, if they cannot avenge the injuries that are done them,
   plainly show by their loud complaints the burning rage and fury of
   their hearts. In order, therefore, that a man may quietly and patiently
   endure the insolence, violence, calumny, and deceit of his enemies, it
   is necessary that he trust in God. The man who is fully persuaded in
   his own heart that God is his defender, will cherish his hope in
   silence, and, calling upon him for help, will lay a restraint upon his
   own passions. Accordingly, Paul, in Romans 12:19, very properly says,
   that we "give place unto wrath" when, oppressed before the world, we
   nevertheless still repose on God. On the other hand, whoever gives
   loose reins to his passions, takes away as much as he can from God, to
   whom alone it belongs, the right of taking vengeance, and deprives
   himself of his assistance. It is indeed certain, that if David had
   obtained a hearing, he would have been ready to defend his own
   innocence; but perceiving that it availed him nothing, nay, that he was
   shut out and debarred from all defense of his cause, he humbly
   submitted, waiting patiently for the heavenly Judge. He therefore says
   that he held his peace, as if he had already been convicted and struck
   dumb. And it is indeed very difficult, when we are conscious of our own
   innocence, patiently and silently to bear an unjust condemnation, as if
   all argument had failed us, and we had no excuse or reply left us.

   Psalm 38:15-20

   15. For on thee, O Jehovah! do I wait: thou wilt answer me, O Lord!
   [56] my God. 16. For I said, lest they rejoice over me when my foot
   slippeth, they magnify themselves against me. 17. Surely I am ready to
   halt, and my sorrow is continually before me. 18. Surely I declare my
   iniquity; and I am dismayed because of my sin. 19. And yet my enemies
   living are become strong; and they that oppose me wrongfully are become
   mighty. 20. And they that reader me evil for good are opposed to me;
   because I follow that which is good.


   15 For on thee, O Jehovah! do I wait. David here shows the source of
   his patience. It consisted in this, that, trusting in the grace of God,
   he overcame all the temptations of the world. And certainly, the mind
   of man will never be framed to gentleness and meekness, nor will he be
   able to subdue his passions, until he has learned never to give up
   hope. The Psalmist, at the same time, adds, that he cherished his hope
   by constant meditation, lest he should yield to despair. And this is
   the only means of our perseverance, when, on the ground of his own
   promises, with which we are furnished, we appeal to him, yea, rather
   when setting before our view his fidelity and his constancy in
   fulfilling what he has promised, we are sureties to ourselves for him.
   Accordingly, Paul, in Romans 5:4, very properly joins patience to hope
   and consolation. The repetition of terms in this verse shows, that this
   holy man was subjected to a severe and arduous conflict. Thou, he says,
   O Lord! my God, wilt answer me. His language implies, that if God
   should delay to come to his help, there was reason to fear that he
   would faint from weariness, or fall into despair, unless, setting this
   double defense before him, he persevered valiantly in the conflict.

   16 For I said, lest they rejoice over me. Here he also confirms his
   faith and his earnestness in prayer from this consideration, that if he
   should be forsaken of God, his enemies would triumph. This indignity,
   on their part, is of no small weight in inducing God to help us; for
   the wicked, in thus magnifying themselves against us, and indulging in
   derision, not only make war with our flesh, but also directly assail
   our faith and endeavor to destroy whatever there is of religion and the
   fear of God in our hearts. What is the object of all their mockery, but
   to persuade us that what God has promised is vain and worthless? The
   Psalmist immediately adds, that it is not without cause that he is
   struck with the fear that his enemies would rejoice over him, since he
   had already had experience of their proud boastings. We are taught from
   this passage, that in proportion as our enemies increase in insolence
   and cruelty towards us, or, seeing us already overwhelmed by a heavy
   load of adversities, in their proud disdain trample us under their
   feet, we ought to cherish the greater hope that God will come to our
   help.

   17 Surely I am ready to halt This verse has led expositors to suppose
   that David was afflicted with some sore, from which he was afraid of
   having brought upon him the infirmity of halting all his days; but I
   have already shown, in Psalm 35:15, that this supposition is very
   improbable. We have certainly no greater reason for supposing that
   David was lame than that Jeremiah was so, when he said,

   "All my familiars watched for my halting." --
   (Jeremiah 20:10,)

   I therefore think that David here employs a metaphorical mode of
   expression, and that his meaning is, that if God did not soon come to
   his aid, there was no hope of his ever being restored to his former
   condition; and that he was so greatly afflicted, that he would walk as
   if he had been maimed or lame all the days of his life. [57] It next
   follows by way of exposition, that his sorrow was continually before
   him. The sense is, that he was so grievously afflicted, that he could
   not forget it for a single moment, so as to obtain some relaxation. In
   both the clauses of the verse, David confesses that his disease is
   incurable, unless he obtain some remedy from God, and that he cannot
   endure it, unless he be raised up and sustained by the hand of God
   himself. This is the reason why he directs all his thoughts and his
   requests to God alone; for as soon as he shall turn aside from him, he
   sees nothing but immediate ruin.

   18 and 19 Surely I declare my iniquity. By comparison, he amplifies
   what he had just said concerning the pride and the reproachful conduct
   of his enemies; for he says, that whilst he is lying in a filthy and
   wretched condition, like a wicked man, and one abandoned by God, they
   fly about in mirth and gladness, nay, they carry their heads high,
   because they are rich and powerful. But first, it is proper to notice
   in what sense it is that he declares his sin. Those, in my judgment,
   are mistaken, who understand this passage simply in the sense of a
   confession of his guilt before God, that he might obtain forgiveness.
   According to their interpretation, the Psalmist is supposed to repeat
   here what we have seen he said

   "I acknowledged my sin unto thee,
   and mine iniquity have I not hid."-- (Psalm 32:5)

   But in this place he is not speaking so much of his repentance, as he
   is bewailing his sad and miserable condition; and, therefore, sin and
   iniquity are to be understood of the afflictions and chastisements
   which are the tokens of God's wrath; as if he had said, that the hand
   of God was against him, and lying so heavily upon him, that from the
   very sight of the misery to which he was reduced, the world in general
   might regard him as a condemned and reprobate man. In order to render
   the meaning more obvious, the 18th and 19th verses must be read
   together, thus: I declare my iniquity, and my enemies are living; I am
   dismayed because of my sin, but they are become strong. I do not,
   however, deny that he regards the miseries to which he was subjected as
   proceeding from his sins. In this respect, the godly differ from the
   wicked, that, being admonished of their transgression by adversity,
   they humbly sist themselves before the judgment-seat of God.
   Accordingly, judging of the cause from the effects, he takes into
   account these two things: First, That thus overwhelmed and afflicted,
   he is lying under a heavy load of miseries; and, secondly, That all
   these evils are justly inflicted as chastisements for sin.

   This living, [58] which he attributes to his enemies, implies as much
   as to enjoy continued and abundant prosperity in all things; and
   therefore he adds, that they are become strong and increase in power I
   interpret the word rvv, rabbab, in this place, increase in power,
   because he would speak improperly were he to be understood as saying,
   that they were multiplied. He does not here complain that they
   increased in number, but rather exalts their greatness, because the
   more they acquired of riches, they acquired so much the greater
   audacity in oppressing the good and the simple. He tells us that he is
   assailed by them wrongfully, and without cause, that he may induce God
   to be the more favorable and propitious to him. And surely, if we would
   have the favor of God for our defense, we must always take care not to
   injure any man, and to do nothing to provoke the hatred of any against
   us.

   This is more fully confirmed in the following verse, in which he
   declares that they requited him evil for the good which he had done
   them. More than this, however, is implied in the language of David. It
   implies that he not only abstained from all hurtful dealing towards his
   enemies, but that he had done them all the good which was in his power;
   and on this account the rage of the wicked is the less excusable, which
   not only moves them to do harm to others without cause, but which
   likewise cannot be appeased by any marks of kindness exercised towards
   them. It is indeed true, that there is nothing which wounds those of an
   ingenuous disposition of mind more than when wicked and ungodly men
   recompense them in a manner so dishonorable and unjust; but when they
   reflect upon this consolatory consideration, that God is no less
   offended with such ingratitude than those to whom the injury is done,
   they have no reason to be troubled beyond measure. To mitigate their
   sorrow, let this doctrine be the subject of their frequent meditation,
   That whenever the wicked, to whom we have endeavored to do good, shall
   requite us evil for good, God will certainly be their judge. In the
   last place, it is added, as the highest degree of their desperate
   wickedness, that they hated David because he studied to practice
   uprightness: They are opposed to me, because I follow that which is
   good It must be admitted, that those are froward and wicked in the
   extreme, nay, even of a devilish disposition, who hold uprightness in
   such abhorrence that they deliberately make war upon those who follow
   after it. It is, indeed, a very sore temptation, that the people of
   God, the more sincerely they endeavor to serve him, should procure to
   themselves so much the more trouble and sorrow; but this consideration
   ought to prove a sufficient ground of consolation to them, that they
   are not only supported by the testimony of a good conscience, but that
   they also know that God is ever ready, and that, too, for this very
   reason, to manifest his mercy towards them. On the ground of this
   assurance, they dare to appear in the presence of God, and entreat him,
   as it is his cause as well as theirs, that he would maintain and defend
   it. There can be no doubt that David, by his own example, has
   prescribed this as a common rule to all the faithful, rather to incur
   the hatred and ill-will of the world, than in the least degree to
   swerve from the path of duty, and without any hesitation to regard
   those as their enemies whom they know to be opposed to that which is
   just and righteous.

   Psalm 38:21-22

   21. Forsake me not, O Jehovah! my God, and be not far from me. 22. Make
   haste to come to my aid, O Lord! [59] my salvation. [60]


   In these concluding verses, David briefly states the chief point which
   he desired, and the sum of his whole prayer; namely, that whereas he
   was forsaken of men, and grievously afflicted in every way, God would
   receive him and raise him up again. He uses three forms of expression;
   first, that God would not forsake him, or cease to take care of him;
   secondly, that he would not be far from him; and, thirdly, that he
   would make haste to help him. David was, indeed, persuaded that God is
   always near to his servants, and that he delays not a single moment
   longer than is necessary. But, as we have seen in another place, it is
   not at all wonderful that the saints, when they unburden themselves of
   their cares and sorrows into the bosom of God, should make their
   requests in language according to the feeling of the flesh. They are
   not ashamed to confess their infirmity, nor is it proper to conceal the
   doubts which arise in their minds. Although, however, waiting was
   wearisome to David according to the flesh, yet in one word he plainly
   shows that he did not pray in uncertainty when he calls God his
   salvation, or the author of his salvation. Some render it to my
   salvation, but this is forced. David rather sets up this as a wall of
   defense against all the devices by which, as we have seen, his faith
   was assailed, That whatever might happen, he was, nevertheless, well
   assured of his salvation in God.

   when Galileo was sentenced to be confined in the dungeons of the
   Inquisition for an indefinite period, for having maintained the
   Copernican system, he was enjoined to repeat as a penance these seven
   Penitential Psalms every week for three years; by which it was
   doubtless intended to extort a sort of confession from him of his
   guilt, and an acknowledgement of the justice of his sentence.

   PSALM 39

   In the beginning of the psalm, David intimates that his heart had been
   seized with extreme bitterness of grief, which forced him to give
   utterance to complaints with too much vehemence and ardor. He confesses
   that whilst he was disposed to be silent, and to exercise patience, he
   was nevertheless compelled, by the vehemence of his sorrow, to break
   out into an excess which he by no means intended. Then he relates the
   complaints which he had made mingled with prayers, which indicate great
   trouble of mind; so that from this it appears that he had wrestled with
   no ordinary effort in resisting temptation, lest he should fall into
   despair.

   To the chief musician, Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.

   It is well known that Jeduthun was one of the chief singers of whom
   sacred history makes mention. (1 Chronicles 9:16; 16:38, 41, 42) It is,
   therefore, probable that this psalm was delivered to the chief singer,
   who was of his household. Some, indeed, understand it as denoting the
   particular kind of tune, and suppose that it was the beginning of some
   other song; but this I consider too forced an interpretation. Nor can I
   agree with others who suppose that David here complains of some
   disease; for unless some urgent reason require it, it is improper to
   limit general statements to particular cases. On the contrary, from the
   extreme character of the sufferings which he here describes, it may be
   presumed that a variety of afflictions is here included, or, at least,
   that some one is referred to which was more severe than all the others,
   and one which had continued for a long time. Besides, it ought to be
   considered that in this psalm David is not proclaiming his own merit,
   as if in his affliction he had presented his prayers to God in the
   language, and according to the spirit dictated by true piety: he rather
   confesses the sin of his infirmity in bursting forth into immoderate
   sorrow, and in being led by the vehemence of this affection to indulge
   in sinful complaints.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 39:1-3

   1. I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue:
   I will keep my mouth with a muzzle, while the wicked standeth before
   me. 2. I was dumb in silence; I held my peace from good; and my sorrow
   was stirred. 3. My heart became hot within me; in my musing a fire
   burned: I spake with my tongue.


   1. I said, I will take heed to my ways. David explains and illustrates
   the greatness of his grief by this circumstance, that, contrary to his
   inclination and resolution, he broke forth into the severest
   complaints. The meaning substantially is, that although he had subdued
   his heart to patience, and resolved to keep silence, yet the violence
   of his grief was such that it forced him to break his resolution, and
   extorted from him, if we might so speak, expressions which indicate
   that he had given way to an undue degree of sorrow. The expression, I
   said, it is well known, does not always mean what is expressed in
   words, but is often used to denote the purpose of the heart, and,
   therefore, the words in heart are sometimes added. David, therefore,
   means not that he boasted of his fortitude and constancy, and made a
   display of them before men, but that before God he was, by continued
   meditation, well fortified and prepared to endure patiently the
   temptations by which he was now assailed. We ought to mark particularly
   the carefulness by which he was distinguished. It was not without cause
   that he was so much intent on exercising watchfulness over himself. He
   did so because he was conscious of his own weakness, and also well knew
   the manifold devices of Satan. He, therefore, looked on the right hand
   and on the left, and kept watch on all sides, lest temptation stealing
   upon him unawares from any quarter might reach even to his heart.
   Access to it, then, had been impossible, since it was shut up on every
   side, if the extreme severity of his grief had not overpowered him, and
   broken his resolution. When he says, I will keep my mouth with a
   muzzle, [61] that I sin not with my tongue, it is not to be understood
   as if he could with difficulty restrain and conceal his grief, (for it
   is mere pretense for a man to show by the countenance and speech the
   appearance of meekness when the heart still swells with pride;) but as
   there is nothing more slippery or loose than the tongue, David declares
   that he had endeavored so carefully to bridle his affections, that not
   so much as one word should escape from his lips which might betray the
   least impatience. And that man must indeed be endued with singular
   fortitude who unfeignedly and deliberately restrains his tongue, which
   is so liable to fall into error. As to what follows, while the wicked
   standeth before me, it is generally understood, as if David had
   concealed his grief, lest he should give occasion of blasphemy to the
   wicked, who, as soon as they see the children of God fail under the
   weight of their afflictions, insolently break forth into derision
   against them, which amounts to a contempt of God himself. But it
   appears to me that by the term standeth, David meant to express
   something more, -- that even while he saw the wicked bearing rule,
   exercising authority, and exalted to honor, he resolved not to speak a
   single word, but to bear patiently the poverty and indignity which
   otherwise grieve and torment not a little even good men. Accordingly,
   he says not merely that when he was in the presence of the wicked he
   restrained himself, lest he should be subjected to their scorn, but
   that even while the worst of men prospered, [62] and, proud of their
   high rank, despised others, he was fully determined in his own mind not
   to be troubled at it. By this he very plainly shows that he was so
   beset with wicked men, ever ready for mischief, that he could not
   freely heave a sigh which was not made the subject of ridicule and
   scorn. Since, then, it was so hard a task for David to restrain his
   tongue, lest he should sin by giving way to complaints, let us learn
   from his example, whenever troubles molest us, to strive earnestly to
   moderate our affections, that no impious expression of dissatisfaction
   against God may slip from us.

   2. I was dumb in silence. He now declares that this resolution of which
   he has spoken had not been a mere passing and momentary thought, but
   that he had shown by his conduct that it was indeed a resolution deeply
   fixed in his heart. He says, then, that he held his peace for a time,
   just as if he had been deaf, which was a singular manifestation of his
   patience. When he thus determined to be silent, it was not such a
   resolution as persons of a changeable disposition, who scarcely ever
   know their own mind, and who can with difficulty be brought to carry
   their desires into effect, often make: he had long and steadfastly
   inured himself to the exercise of patience; and this he had done, not
   only by keeping silence but by making himself utterly dumb, as if he
   had been deprived of the power of speech. The expression from good is
   expounded by some in the sense that he not only refrained from uttering
   sinful and unadvised words, but also that he abstained from speaking on
   any subject whatever. Others think that he held his peace from good,
   either because, being overwhelmed with miseries and afflictions, he
   found no relief to whatever side he turned, or else, because, by reason
   of the greatness of his sorrow, he was unable to sing the praises of
   God. But in my opinion the natural sense is, that although he was able
   adequately to defend himself, and it could not be shown that he wanted
   just and proper grounds of complaint, yet he refrained from speaking of
   his own mere will. [63] He might have encountered the ungodly with a
   good defense of his own innocence, but he rather preferred to forego
   the prosecution of his righteous cause than indulge in any intemperate
   sorrow. He adds in the last clause of the verse, that although he thus
   restrained himself for a time, yet at length the violence of his grief
   broke through all the barriers which he had set to his tongue. If
   David, who was so valiant a champion, failed in the midst of his
   course, how much greater reason have we to be afraid lest we fall in
   like manner? He says that his sorrow was stirred, because, as we shall
   soon see, the ardor of his affections was inflamed so as to become
   tumultuous. Some render the phrase in this sense, that his sorrow was
   corrupted, as if his meaning were, that it became worse; just as we
   know that a wound becomes worse when it happens to putrify or fester:
   but this sense is forced.

   3. My heart became hot within me He now illustrates the greatness of
   his grief by the introduction of a simile, telling us that his sorrow,
   being internally suppressed, became so much the more inflamed, until
   the ardent passion of his soul continued to increase in strength. From
   this we may learn the very profitable lesson, that the more strenuously
   any one sets himself to obey God, and employs all his endeavors to
   attain the exercise of patience, the more vigorously is he assailed by
   temptation: for Satan, whilst he is not so troublesome to the
   indifferent and careless, and seldom looks near them, displays all his
   forces in hostile array against that individual. If, therefore, at any
   time we feel ardent emotions struggling and raising a commotion in our
   breasts, we should call to remembrance this conflict of David, that our
   courage may not fail us, or at least that our infirmity may not drive
   us headlong to despair. The dry and hot exhalations which the sun
   causes to arise in summer, if nothing occurred in the atmosphere to
   obstruct their progress, would ascend into the air without commotion;
   but when intervening clouds prevent their free ascent, a conflict
   arises, from which the thunders are produced. It is similar with
   respect to the godly who desire to lift up their hearts to God. If they
   would resign themselves to the vain imaginations which arise in their
   minds, they might enjoy a sort of unrestrained liberty to indulge in
   every fancy; but because they endeavor to resist their influence, and
   seek to devote themselves to God, obstructions which arise from the
   opposition of the flesh begin to trouble them. Whenever, therefore, the
   flesh shall put forth its efforts, and shall kindle up a fire in our
   hearts, let us know that we are exercised with the same kind of
   temptation which occasioned so much pain and trouble to David. In the
   end of the verse he acknowledges that the severity of the affliction
   with which he was visited had at length overcome him, and that he
   allowed foolish and unadvised words to pass from his lips. In his own
   person he sets before us a mirror of human infirmity, that, being
   warned by the danger to which we are exposed, we may learn betimes to
   seek protection under the shadow of God's wings. When he says that he
   spake with his tongue, it is not a superfluous mode of expression, but
   a true and fuller confession of his sin, in that he had not only given
   way to sinful murmuring, but had even uttered loud complaints.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [61] The Hebrew word mchsvm, machsom, rendered bridle in our English
   version, properly signifies a muzzle, and is so rendered in Deuteronomy
   25:4. "Our translations," observes Mant, "say as with a bridle.' But we
   do not see how a bridle would preclude the person from speaking; nor is
   it a correct phrase, which the word muzzle is." It is probable that the
   bridles of the ancients were made in the form of muzzles.

   [62] Dr Geddes renders the last clause of the verse, "While the wicked
   prosper before me."

   [63] French and Skinner read, "I held my peace from good and bad." In
   the Hebrew it is simply "from good;" but they observe, "This expression
   occurs frequently in Scripture, and it would seem, that owing to the
   constant use of it, one part only of the sentence has been here
   expressed. Thus, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or
   bad,' (Genesis 31:24.) Again, Absalom spake neither good nor bad,' (2
   Samuel 13:22.")

   Psalm 39:4-6

   4. O Jehovah! cause me to know my end, and the number of my days, that
   I may understand how long I may live. [64] 5. Behold, thou hast made my
   days as a hand-breadth, and mine age as if it were nothing before thee:
   truly every man, while he standeth, is wholly vanity. Selah. 6. Surely
   man walketh in a shadow; surely he disquieteth himself in vain: they
   heap together [riches, [65] ] and know not who shall gather them.


   4. O Jehovah! cause me to know my end. It appears from this, that David
   was transported by an improper and sinful excess of passion, seeing he
   finds fault with God. This will appear still more clearly from the
   following verses. It is true, indeed, that in what follows he
   introduces pious and becoming prayers, but here he complains, that,
   being a mortal man, whose life is frail and transitory, he is not
   treated more mildly by God. Of this, and similar complaints, the
   discourses of Job are almost full. It is, therefore, not without anger
   and resentment that David speaks in this manner: "O God, since thou art
   acting with so much severity towards me, at least make me to know how
   long thou hast appointed me to live. But is it so, that my life is but
   a moment, why then dost thou act with so great rigour? and why dost
   thou accumulate upon my head such a load of miseries, as if I had yet
   many ages to live? What does it profit me to have been born, if I must
   pass the period of my existence, which is so brief, in misery, and
   oppressed with a continued succession of calamities?"

   Accordingly, this verse should be read in connection with the following
   one. Behold, thou hast made my days as a hand-breadth. A hand-breadth
   is the measure of four fingers, and is here taken for a very small
   measure; as if it had been said, the life of man flies swiftly away,
   and the end of it, as it were, touches the beginning. Hence the
   Psalmist concludes that all men are only vanity before God. As to the
   meaning of the words, he does not ask that the brevity of human life
   should be shown to him, as if he knew it not. There is in this language
   a kind of irony, as if he had said, Let us count the number of the
   years which still remain to me on earth, and will they be a sufficient
   recompense for the miseries which I endure? Some render the word chdl,
   chedel, mundane; and others temporal, that is to say, that which
   endures only for a time. But the latter rendering is not appropriate in
   this place: for David does not as yet expressly declare the shortness
   of his life, but continues to speak on that subject ambiguously. If the
   word mundane is adopted, the sense will be, Show me whether thou wilt
   prolong my life to the end of the world. But in my judgment, the
   translation which I have followed is much more appropriate; and,
   besides, there may have been a transposition of the letters d, daleth,
   and l, lamed, making the word chedel for cheled. It may, however, very
   properly be taken for an age or period of life. [66] When he says that
   his age is, as it were, nothing before God, in order to excite God so
   much the more to pity and compassion, he appeals to him as a witness of
   his frailty, intimating, that it is not a thing unknown to him how
   transitory and passing the life of man is. The expression, wholly or
   altogether vanity, [67] implies that among the whole human race there
   is nothing but vanity. He declares this of men, even whilst they are
   standing; [68] that is to say, when, being in the prime and vigor of
   life, they wish to be held in estimation, and seem to themselves to be
   men possessed of considerable influence and power. It was the pangs of
   sorrow which forced David to give utterance to these complaints; but it
   is to be observed, that it is chiefly when men are sore oppressed by
   adversity that they are made to feel their nothingness in the sight of
   God. Prosperity so intoxicates them, that, forgetful of their
   condition, and sunk in insensibility, they dream of an immortal state
   on earth. It is very profitable for us to know our own frailty, but we
   must beware lest, on account of it, we fall into such a state of sorrow
   as may lead us to murmur and repine. David speaks truly and wisely in
   declaring, that man, even when he seems to have risen to the highest
   state of greatness, is only like the bubble which rises upon the water,
   blown up by the wind; but he is in fault when he takes occasion from
   this to complain of God. Let us, therefore, so feel the misery of our
   present condition, as that, however cast down and afflicted, we may, as
   humble suppliants, lift up our eyes to God, and implore his mercy. This
   we find David does a little after, having corrected himself; for he
   does not continue to indulge in rash and inconsiderate lamentations,
   but lifting up his soul in the exercise of faith, he attains heavenly
   consolation.

   6. Surely man walketh in a shadow. [69] He still prosecutes the same
   subject. By the word shadow, he means, that there is nothing
   substantial in man, but that he is only, as we say, a vain show, and
   has I know not how much of display and ostentation. [70] Some translate
   the word darkness, and understand the Psalmist's language in this
   sense, That the life of man vanishes away before it can be known. But
   in these words David simply declares of every man individually what
   Paul extends to the whole world, when he says,

   "The fashion of this world passeth away." --
   1 Corinthians 7:31

   Thus he denies that there is any thing abiding in men, because the
   appearance of strength which displays itself in them for a time soon
   passes away. What he adds, that men disquiet themselves in vain, shows
   the very height of their vanity; as if he had said, It seems as if men
   were born for the very purpose of rendering themselves more and more
   contemptible: for although they are only as a shadow, yet as if they
   were fools, or rather insane, they involve themselves needlessly in
   harassing cares, and vexing themselves to no purpose. He expresses
   still more plainly how they manifest their folly, when he declares that
   while they anxiously and carefully heap up riches, they never think
   that they must soon, and it may be suddenly, leave their present abode.
   And why is it that they thus fret away their mind and body, but only
   because they imagine that they can never have enough? for by their
   insatiable desire of gain, they eagerly grasp at all the riches of the
   world, as if they had to live a hundred times the life of man.
   Moreover, David does not in this passage hold up to scorn the
   covetousness of man in the same sense in which Solomon does,
   Ecclesiastes 5:10; for he not only speaks of their heirs, but declares
   generally, that men disquiet and vex themselves with care, although
   they know not who shall reap the fruit of their labor in amassing
   riches. [71] They may indeed wish to make provision for themselves; but
   what madness and folly is it for them to torment themselves with
   incessant and unprofitable cares which have no certain object or limit?
   David here condemns those ardent and unbridled desires, under the
   influence of which worldly men are carried away, and talk in a strange
   manner, confounding heaven and earth; for they admit not that they are
   mortal, much less do they consider that their life is bounded by the
   narrow limits of a hand-breadth. David spoke under the influence of a
   distempered and troubled state of mind; but there is included in his
   language this very profitable lesson, that there is no remedy better
   fitted for enabling us to rise above all unnecessary cares, than the
   recollection that the brief period of our life is only, as it were, a
   hand-breadth.

   [64] Or, as Horsley reads, "how brief I am."

   [65] The word riches is a supplement; there being no word for it in
   Calvin's version, nor in the Hebrew text; but the meaning evidently is,
   "they heap up, accumulate, or amass riches." Horsley reads, "His
   accumulated riches -- he knoweth not who shall gather them."

   [66] "Mine age, i.e., the whole extent of my life." -- Cresswell.

   [67] The word hvl, hebel, rendered vanity, according to some, means the
   mirage, that deceptive appearance of a collection of waters in the
   distance, which the traveler, through the Arabian deserts, imagines he
   sees before him, and from which he fondly hopes to quench his thirst;
   but which, upon his coming up to it, he finds to be only burning sands,
   to which the reflection of the light of the sun had given the
   appearance of a lake of water. According to others, vanity means a
   vapor, as the breath of one's mouth, which speedily vanishes; to which
   the apostle refers in James 4:14. "I take the word in its proper
   sense," [vapor,] says Bishop Mant, "as more poetical and energetic than
   the derivative one of vanity.'" See Simonis and Parkhurst on hvl. Abel
   gave to his second son the name of Hebel, vanity, and here David
   declares that kl-'dm col-adam, all adam, every man is hebel, vanity.

   [68] This word here rendered standeth "is well paraphrased by Dathe,
   Dum firmissime constitutus videatur.'" -- Rogers' Psalms in Heb.,
   volume2, p. 200.

   [69] In the Hebrew it is literally, "Man walketh in an image;" a
   phantasm, that which seems to be something real and substantial, but
   which does not deserve that character, which is an appearance only.
   Life is a mere show; "the baseless fabric of a vision;" it has the
   semblance of solidity, but there is no reality in it. The word occurs
   again in Psalm 73:20, "Thou shalt despise their image;" their vain
   show, or phantastic prosperity. Walford reads, "walketh as a shadow;"
   observing, that "the prefix v is often used for k as a particle of
   similitude." he farther observes, that Dathe's translation, "he pursues
   a shadow," gives a good sense, but does not convey the exact notion of
   the figure that is conveyed by the Hebrew.

   [70] "Et je ne scay quelle parade et ostentation." -- Fr.

   [71] It is important to mark the difference between the Hebrew word
   tskr, tsabar, here rendered to heap together, and the Word 'sph, asaph,
   rendered to gather "The former," says Hammond, "here appears to contain
   all the toil of the harvest, in reaping, binding, setting up, and
   heaping things together, bringing them from the several places where
   they grow, into a cumulus The latter denotes the stowing or housing,
   laying it up, removing or carrying it out of the field, where it is
   heaped or set up, ready for carriage. For so 'sph signifies sometimes
   to lay up, sometimes to take away This, then, is the description of the
   vanity of our human estate, that when a man hath run through all the
   labors of acquisition, and hath nothing visible to interpose betwixt
   him and his enjoyments, yet even then he is uncertain, not only whether
   himself shall possess it at last, but whether his heir shall do it;
   nay, he knows not whether his enemy may not; he cannot tell who shall
   gather them into the barn,' or enjoy them when they are there."

   Psalm 39:7-9

   7. And now, O Lord! [72] what do I wait for? my hope is towards thee.
   8. Deliver me from all my sin; do not make me the reproach of the
   foolish. [73] 9. I was dumb; I will not open my mouth, because thou
   hast done it.


   7. And now, O Lord! what do I wait for? David, having acknowledged that
   his heart had been too much under the influence of ardent and impetuous
   emotion, from which he had experienced great disquietude, now returns
   to a calm and settled state of mind; and from this what I have before
   stated is rendered still more obvious, namely, that this psalm consists
   partly of appropriate prayers and partly of inconsiderate complaints. I
   have said that David here begins to pray aright. It is true, that even
   worldly men sometimes feel in the very same way in which David here
   acknowledges that he felt; but the knowledge of their own vanity does
   not lead them so far as to seek substantial support in God. On the
   contrary, they rather wilfully render themselves insensible, that they
   may indulge undisturbed in their own vanity. We may learn from this
   passage, that no man looks to God for the purpose of depending upon
   him, and resting his hope in him, until he is made to feel his own
   frailty, yea, and even brought to nought. There is tacitly great force
   in the adverb now, as if David had said, The flattery and vain
   imaginations by which the minds of men are held fast in the sleep of
   security no longer deceive me, but I am now fully sensible of my
   condition. But we must go beyond this elementary stage; for it is not
   enough, that, being aroused by a sense of our infirmity, we should seek
   with fear and trembling to know our duty, unless at the same time God
   manifest himself to us, on whom alone all our expectation should
   depend. Accordingly, as it serves no end for worldly men to be
   convinced of their utter vanity, because, although convinced of this,
   they never improve by it, let us learn to press forward and make still
   further progress, in order that, being as it were dead, we may be
   quickened by God, whose peculiar office it is to create all things out
   of nothing; for man then ceases to be vanity, and begins to be truly
   something, when, aided by the power of God, he aspires to heavenly
   things.

   8. Deliver me from all my sins. In this verse the Psalmist still
   continues his godly and holy prayer. He is now no longer carried away
   by the violence of his grief to murmur against God, but, humbly
   acknowledging himself guilty before God, he has recourse to his mercy.
   In asking to be delivered from his transgressions, he ascribes the
   praise of righteousness to God, while he charges upon himself the blame
   of all the misery which he endures; and he blames himself, not only on
   account of one sin, but acknowledges that he is justly chargeable with
   manifold transgressions. By this rule we must be guided, if we would
   wish to obtain an alleviation of our miseries; for, until the very
   source of them has been dried up, they will never cease to follow one
   another in rapid succession. David unquestionably wished an alleviation
   of his miseries, but, as he expected that, as soon as he should be
   reconciled to God, the chastisement of his sins would also cease, he
   only here asks that his sins may be forgiven him. We are thus taught by
   the example of David, not merely to seek deliverance from the miseries
   which afflict and trouble us, but to trace them to their cause and
   source, entreating God that he would not lay our sins to our charge,
   but blot out our guilt. What follows concerning the reproach or scorn
   of the foolish may be understood in an active as well as a passive
   signification, denoting, either that God would not abandon him to the
   mockery of the wicked, or that he would not involve him in the same
   disgrace to which the ungodly are given over. As, however, either of
   these senses will agree very well with the design of the Psalmist, I
   leave it to the reader to adopt the one which he prefers. Besides, the
   word nvl, nabal, signifies not only a foolish person, but also a
   contemptible man, one who is utterly worthless and base. It is at least
   certain, that by this word the reprobate, whom the Scriptures condemn
   for their folly, are intended; because, being deprived of their reason
   and understanding, they break forth into every excess in contemning and
   reproaching God.

   9. I was dumb Here David blames himself, because he had not preserved
   that silence which, as we have already seen, the violence of his grief
   forced him to break. When he says then that he was dumb, he does not
   mean this as a commendation of the uniform and persevering restraint
   which he had exercised over himself. It is rather a correction of his
   error, as if reproving his own impatience, he had spoken within himself
   in this way: What doest thou? thou hadst enjoined upon thyself silence,
   and now thou murmurest proudly against God; what wilt thou gain by this
   presumption? We have here a very profitable and instructive lesson; for
   nothing is better fitted to restrain the violent paroxysms of grief,
   than the recollection that we have to do, not with a mortal man, but
   with God, who will always maintain his own righteousness in opposition
   to all that men may say against it in their murmuring complaints, and
   even in their outrageous accusations. What is the reason why the great
   majority of men run to such excess in their impatience, but because
   they forget that, in doing so, they dare to plead a controversy with
   God? Thus, while some impute all their miseries to fortune, and others
   to men, and others account for them from a variety of causes which
   their own fancy suggests, while scarcely one in a hundred recognises in
   them the hand of God, they allow themselves to indulge in bitter
   complaint, without ever thinking that in so doing they offend God.
   David, on the contrary, in order to subdue every unholy desire and
   sinful excess, returns to God, and resolves to keep silence, because
   the affliction which he is now suffering proceeded from God. As David,
   who was thus afflicted with the severest trials, resolved nevertheless
   to keep silence, let us learn from this, that it is one of the chief
   exercises of our faith to humble ourselves under the mighty hand of
   God, and to submit to his judgments without murmuring or complaint. It
   is to be observed, that men humbly and calmly submit themselves to God
   only when they are persuaded, not only that he does by his almighty
   power whatever he pleases, but that he is also a righteous Judge; for
   although the wicked feel that the hand of God is upon them, yet as they
   charge him with cruelty and tyranny, they cease not to pour forth
   horrible blasphemies against him. In the meantime, David regards the
   secret judgments of God with such reverence and wonder, that, satisfied
   with his will alone, he considers it sinful to open his mouth to utter
   a single word against him.

   Psalm 39:10-11

   10. Take away thy stroke from me: I have failed [or fainted] by the
   blow of thy hand. 11. Thou chastisest man with rebukes for his
   iniquity; and as a moth, thou makest his excellency to consume away:
   surely every man is vanity. Selah.


   10 Take away thy stroke from me. David here confirms the prayer which
   he had already presented, namely, that having obtained pardon from God,
   he might, at the same time, be gently dealt with by him. This prayer,
   however, does not disturb the silence of which he had just made
   mention; for our desires and prayers, if they are framed according to
   the rule of God's word, are not inconsiderate and noisy so as to
   provoke the divine displeasure against us, but proceed from the calm
   stillness which faith and patience produce in our hearts. It is indeed
   true, that when any one prays earnestly to God, he cannot fail to mix
   up with it his own feelings, pour forth his complaints, and manifest an
   extreme ardor. But we see that David, who formerly bewailed his
   miseries in loud lamentations, now sets himself calmly to consider and
   weigh what he merited, and prays for pardon. His meaning is, that God
   would mitigate the punishment which he had inflicted upon him. The
   reason immediately follows; for I have fainted by the blow of thy hand.
   In thus speaking, David does not allege this as an excuse to extenuate
   his fault, but desires that he may be borne with in his infirmity. As
   he says with respect to himself individually, that he is consumed,
   because he feels that the hand of God is against him, so he immediately
   states in the 11th verse the same truth in general terms, telling us,
   that if God should begin to deal with us according to the strict
   demands of the law, the consequence would be, that all would perish,
   and be utterly overwhelmed under his wrath. He plainly shows, first,
   that he is speaking not of any one man, or even of men generally, for
   he makes use of a Hebrew word, which denotes a man renowned for his
   valor, courage, or excellence; [74] and then, secondly, he says, that
   if God should set himself to chastise such persons, every thing which
   they esteem precious in themselves would consume away or be dissolved.
   The sum is, that among men there is no one endued with such power and
   glory whom the wrath of God, if it burn fiercely against him, will not
   forthwith bring to nothing. But it will be necessary to examine the
   words more minutely. David does not simply describe the dreadful
   character of God's wrath; but at the same time he declares and sets
   forth his righteousness in all the punishments which he inflicts upon
   men. The judgments of God sometimes strike fear and dread into the
   hearts even of heathen men, but their blindness fills them with such
   rage, that they still continue to fight against God. By the term
   rebukes, David means severe punishments, such as are the tokens of
   strict justice and signs of divine wrath. We know that God often
   exercises the rod of his chastisement upon true believers, but he does
   it in such a manner as that in punishing them he at the same time gives
   them a taste of his mercy and his love, and not only tempers the
   chastisements with which he visits them, but also mingles them with
   comfort, which serves to render them much more tolerable. David, then,
   is not speaking in this place of fatherly chastisement, but of the
   punishment which God inflicts upon the reprobate, when, like an
   inexorable judge in the exercise of his office, he executes against
   them the judgment which they have merited. He tells us that when God
   makes this rigour to be felt, there is no man who does not forthwith
   consume or pine away. At first view the comparison of God to a moth may
   seem absurd; for what relation is there, it may be said, between a
   small moth-worm and the infinite majesty of God? I answer, That David
   has with much propriety made use of this simile, that we may know that
   although God does not openly thunder from heaven against the reprobate,
   yet his secret curse ceases not to consume them away, just as the moth,
   though unperceived, wastes by its secret gnawing a piece of cloth or
   wood. [75] At the same time, he alludes to the excellency [76] of man,
   which he says is destroyed as it were by corruption, when God is
   offended, even as the moth destroys the most precious cloths by wasting
   them. The Scriptures often very appropriately employ various
   similitudes in this Way, and are wont to apply them sometimes in one
   view and sometimes in another. When Hezekiah (Isaiah 38:13) compares
   God to a lion, he does so in reference to the feelings of his own mind,
   because he was so prostrated and overwhelmed with fear and terror. But
   in this place David teaches us, that although the world may not
   perceive the dreadful vengeance of God, yet it consumes the reprobate
   by secretly gnawing them. This sentence, that every man is vanity, is
   again very properly repeated; for until we are overcome by the power of
   God, and as it were humbled in the dust, we never search into our own
   hearts, that the knowledge of our own vanity may divest us of all
   presumption. Whence is it that men are so foolishly satisfied with
   themselves, yea, and even applaud themselves, unless it be that, so
   long as God bears with them, they are wilfully blind to their own
   infirmities? The only remedy, then, by which men are cured of pride is
   when, alarmed with a sense of God's wrath, they begin not only to be
   dissatisfied with themselves, but also to humble themselves even to the
   dust.

   vertueux, courageux, ou excellent." -- Fr. The Hebrew word is 'ys, ish
   See [2]volume 1, p. 40, note.

   [75] The meaning according to our English version seems to be, that the
   beauty of man is consumed as the moth is consumed. "But," says Walford,
   "this gives no correct or suitable sense. The design is to state, not
   that the moth is consumed, but that it is a consumer or spoiler of
   garments." He reads, "With rebukes thou chastisest man for iniquity,
   Then thou destroyest his goodliness as a moth
   destroyeth a garment." This is precisely Calvin's interpretation. The
   moth is called in Hebrew s, ash, from its corroding and destroying the
   texture of cloth, etc. See Parkhurst's Lexicon on the word s. The
   metaphor here employed is of frequent occurrence in Scripture. For
   example, in Hosea 5:12, God says, "I will be to Ephraim as a moth,"
   that is, I will consume them; and in Isaiah 50:9, it is said, "The moth
   shall eat them as a garment."

   [76] The original word, which Calvin renders "excellency," is
   translated by Hammond "precious things;" by which he understands
   wealth, greatness, health, beauty, strength, and, in short, whatever is
   most precious to us.

   Psalm 39:12-13

   12. Hear my prayer, O Jehovah! and hearken to my cry; and hold not thy
   peace [77] at my tears: for I am a stranger before thee, and a
   sojourner, as all my fathers were. 13. Let me alone, that I may recover
   strength, before I depart, and be no more.


   12 Hear my prayer, O Jehovah! David gradually increases his vehemence
   in prayer. He speaks first of prayer; in the second place, of crying;
   and in the third place, of tears This gradation is not a mere figure of
   rhetoric, which serves only to adorn the style, or to express the same
   thing in different language. This shows that David bewailed his
   condition sincerely, and from the bottom of his heart; and in this he
   has given us, by his own example, a rule for prayer. When he calls
   himself a stranger and a sojourner, he again shows how miserable his
   condition was; and he adds expressly, before God, not only because men
   are absent from God so long as they dwell in this world, but in the
   same sense in which he formerly said, My days are before thee as
   nothing; that is to say, God, without standing in need of any one to
   inform him, knows well enough that men have only a short journey to
   perform in this world, the end of which is soon reached, or that they
   remain only a short time in it, as those who are lodged in a house for
   pay. [78] The purport of the Psalmist's discourse is, that God sees
   from heaven how miserable our condition would be, if he did not sustain
   us by his mercy.

   13 Let me alone, that I may recover strength. Literally, it is, cease
   from me, and therefore some explain it, Let there be a wall raised
   betwixt us, that thy hand may not reach me. Others read, as a
   supplement, the word eyes; but as to the sense, it matters little which
   of the expositions be adopted, for the meaning is the same, That David
   entreats God to grant him a little relaxation from his trouble, that he
   might recover strength, or, at least, enjoy a short respite, before he
   depart from this world. This concluding verse of the psalm relates to
   the disquietude and sinful emotions which he had experienced according
   to the flesh; for he seems in the way of complaining of God, to ask
   that at least time might be granted him to die, as men are wont to
   speak who are grievously harassed by their affliction. I admit, that he
   speaks in a becoming manner, in acknowledging that there is no hope of
   his being restored to health, until God cease to manifest his
   displeasure; but he errs in this, that he asks a respite, just that he
   may have time to die. We might, indeed, regard the prayer as allowable,
   by understanding it in this sense: Lord, as it will not be possible for
   me to endure thy stroke any longer, but I must, indeed, miserably
   perish, if thou continuest to afflict me severely, at least grant me
   relief for a little season, that in calmness and peace I may commit my
   soul into thy hands. But we may easily infer, from the language which
   he employs, that his mind was so affected with the bitterness of his
   grief that he could not present a prayer pure and well seasoned with
   the sweetness of faith; for he says, before I depart, and be no more: a
   form of speech which indicates the feeling almost of despair. Not that
   David could regard death as the entire annihilation of man, or that,
   renouncing all hope of his salvation, he resigned himself to
   destruction; but he employs this language, because he had previously
   been so much depressed by reason of grief, that he could not lift up
   his heart with so much cheerfulness as it behoved him. This is a mode
   of expression which is to be found more than once in the complaints of
   Job. It is obvious, therefore, that, although David endeavored
   carefully to restrain the desires of the flesh, yet these occasioned
   him so much disquietude and trouble, that they forced him to exceed the
   proper limits in his grief.

   PSALM 40

   David, being delivered from some great danger, and it may be, not from
   one only, but from many, extols very highly the grace of God, and by
   means of this, his soul is filled with admiration of the providence of
   God, which extends itself to the whole human race. Then he protests
   that he will give himself wholly to the service of God, and defines
   briefly in what manner God is to be served and honored. Afterwards, he
   again returns to the exercise of thanksgiving, and celebrates the
   praises of the Eternal by rehearsing many of his glorious and powerful
   deeds. Lastly, when he has complained of his enemies, he concludes the
   psalm with a new prayer.

   1. In waiting I waited The beginning of this psalm is an expression of
   thanksgiving, in which David relates that he had been delivered, not
   only from danger, but also from present death. Some are of opinion, but
   without good reason, that it ought to be understood of sickness. It is
   rather to be supposed that David here comprehends a multitude of
   dangers from which he had escaped. He had certainly been more than once
   exposed to the greatest danger, even of death, so that, with good
   reason, he might be said to have been swallowed up in the gulf of
   death, and sunk in the miry clay It, nevertheless, appears that his
   faith had still continued firm, for he ceased not to trust in God,
   although the long continuance of the calamity had well nigh exhausted
   his patience. He tells us, not merely that he had waited, but by the
   repetition of the same expression, he shows that he had been a long
   time in anxious suspense. In proportion then as his trial was
   prolonged, the evidence and proof of his faith in enduring the delay
   with calmness and equanimity of mind was so much the more apparent. The
   meaning in short is, that although God delayed his help, yet the heart
   of David did not faint, or grow weary from delay; but that after he had
   given, as it were, sufficient proof of his patience, he was at length
   heard. In his example there is set before us this very useful doctrine,
   that although God may not forthwith appear for our help, but rather of
   design keep us in suspense and perplexity, yet we must not lose
   courage, inasmuch as faith is not thoroughly tried, except by long
   endurance. The result, too, of which he speaks in terms of praise,
   ought to inspire us with increased fortitude. God may succor us more
   slowly than we desire, but, when he seems to take no notice of our
   condition, or, if we might so speak, when he seems to be inactive or to
   sleep, this is totally different from deceit: for if we are enabled by
   the invincible strength and power of faith to endure, the fitting
   season of our deliverance will at length arrive.

   2. And he drew me out of the roaring pit. Some translate, from the pit
   of desolation, [80] because the verb s'h, shaah, from which the noun
   s'vm, shaon, is derived, signifies to destroy or to waste, as well as
   to resound or echo. But it is more appropriate to consider that there
   is here an allusion to the deep gulfs, where the waters gush with a
   tumultuous force. [81] By this similitude he shows that he was placed
   in as imminent peril of death as if he had been cast into a deep pit,
   roaring with the impetuous rage of waters. To the same purpose also is
   the similitude of the miry clay, by which he intimates that he had been
   so nearly overwhelmed by the weight of his calamities, that it was no
   easy matter to extricate him from them. Next, there follows a sudden
   and incredible change, by which he makes manifest to all the greatness
   of the grace which had been bestowed upon him. He declares that his
   feet were set upon a rock, whereas formerly he had been overwhelmed
   with water; and that his steps were established or upheld, whereas
   before they were not only unsteady and slippery, but were also stuck
   fast in the mire.

   3. And he hath put into my mouth a new song In the first clause of the
   verse he concludes the description of what God had done for him. By
   God's putting a new song into his mouth he denotes the consummation of
   his deliverance. In whatever way God is pleased to succor us, he asks
   nothing else from us in return but that we should be thankful for and
   remember it. As often, therefore, as he bestows benefits upon us, so
   often does he open our mouths to praise his name. Since God, by acting
   liberally towards us, encourages us to sing his praises, David with
   good reason reckons, that having been so wonderfully delivered, the
   matter of a new song had been furnished to him. He uses the word new in
   the sense of exquisite and not ordinary, even as the manner of his
   deliverance was singular and worthy of everlasting remembrance. It is
   true, that there is no benefit of God so small that it ought not to
   call forth our highest praises; but the more mightily he stretches
   forth his hand to help us, the more does it become us to stir up
   ourselves to fervent zeal in this holy exercise, so that our songs may
   correspond to the greatness of the favor which has been conferred upon
   us.

   Many shall see it Here the Psalmist extends still farther the fruit of
   the aid which he had experienced, telling us, that it will prove the
   means of instruction common to all. And certainly it is the will of God
   that the benefits which he bestows upon any individual of the faithful
   should be proofs of the goodness which he constantly exercises towards
   all of them, so that the one, instructed by the example of the other,
   should not doubt that the same grace will be manifested towards
   himself. The terms fear, and hope, or trust, do not seem at first view
   to harmonise; but David has not improperly joined them together; for no
   man will ever entertain the hope of the favor of God but he whose mind
   is first imbued with the fear of God. I understand fear in general to
   mean the feeling of piety which is produced in us by the knowledge of
   the power, equity, and mercy of God. The judgment which God executed
   against the enemies of David served, it is true, to inspire all men
   with fear; but, in my opinion, David rather means, that by the
   deliverance which he had obtained, many would be induced to yield
   themselves to the service of God, and to submit with all reverence to
   his authority, because they would know him to be the Judge of the
   world. Now, whoever submits cordially to the will of God will of
   necessity join hope with fear; especially when there is presented to
   his view the evidence of the grace by which God commonly allures all
   men to himself; for I have already said that God is presented to our
   view as merciful and kind to others, that we may assure ourselves that
   he will be the same towards us. As to the word see, of which David
   makes use, we are to understand it as referring not only to the eyes,
   but chiefly to the perception of the mind. All without distinction saw
   what had happened, but to many of them it never occurred to recognize
   the deliverance of David as the work of God. Since, then, so many are
   blind regarding the works of God, let us learn, that those only are
   considered to see clearly to whom the Spirit of understanding has been
   given, that they may not occupy their minds in dwelling upon the mere
   events which take place, but may discern in them by faith the secret
   hand of God.

   Psalm 40:4-5

   4. Blessed is the man who hath set Jehovah for his confidence, and hath
   not regarded the proud, and those who turn aside to lying. [82] 5. Many
   are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, O Jehovah! my God: and it
   is impossible to reckon up in order to thee, [83] thy counsels towards
   us. I will declare and speak of them; they are more than can be told.


   4. Blessed is the man who hath set Jehovah for his confidence David
   here relates what ground for good hope his deliverance would give to
   all the faithful; inasmuch as, setting aside all the allurements of the
   world, they would thereby be encouraged to commit themselves with
   confidence to the protection of God; persuaded not only that they are
   happy who trust in him alone, but that all other expectations at
   variance with this are deceitful and cursed. This assurance is not
   natural to us, but is derived partly from the word of God, and partly
   from his works; although, as I have said before, the contemplation
   alone of the works of God would not kindle this light within us, unless
   God, illuminating us by his word, should show us his benevolence. After
   having promised to be gracious to us, in manifesting also his goodness
   by indubitable proofs, he confirms with his own hand what he had
   previously uttered with his lips. David, therefore, from the fact of
   his having been restored to life from the abyss of death, justly
   declares that the faithful are taught from this proof -- what men are
   naturally so reluctant to believe -- that they are happy who trust in
   God alone.

   As the instability of our nature commonly tends to draw us downward,
   and as all of us, from our proneness to yield to delusions, are tempted
   by many wicked examples, David immediately adds, that he is blessed who
   regardeth not the proud Some, indeed, render rhvym, rehabim, the rich,
   or the great of this world, but improperly, in my opinion; because
   pride, and turning aside to lies, are two things which David here joins
   together. To regard the great of the earth, therefore, does not
   signify, as they suppose, to rely upon their power and riches, as if a
   man's welfare depended thereupon, but it rather means to be carried
   away by their examples, to imitate their conduct. When we are
   everywhere constantly seeing men puffed up with pride, who despise God,
   and place their highest felicity in ambition, in fraud, in extortion,
   in guile, a perverse desire of imitating them steals upon us by
   degrees; and, especially when every thing turns out according to their
   wishes, a vain and delusive expectation solicits us to try the same
   course. David, therefore, wisely, and not without good reason, warns
   us, that in order to have our mind constantly fixed in simple reliance
   upon God alone, we must guard against those evil examples which ever
   seek to allure us on all sides to apostatise from him. Moreover, when
   he says that the proud turn aside to lying, or vanity, [84] in this way
   he describes briefly the foolish confidence of the flesh. What else is
   the pride of those who put their own fancies in the place of God but a
   vain illusion? Certainly the man who, puffed up by the breath of fond
   conceit, arrogates any thing in the least degree to himself, flatters
   himself to his own destruction. In short, pride and vanity are opposed
   to the holy confidence which relies upon God alone; for there is
   nothing more difficult to the flesh than to trust in God alone, and the
   world is always full of proud and haughty men, who, soothing themselves
   with vain allurements, would soon corrupt the minds of the godly, if
   this arrest were not laid upon them, to restrain, as with a bridle,
   their erroneous and extravagant opinions.

   5. Many are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, O Jehovah!
   Interpreters are not entirely agreed as to these words; but it is
   generally admitted that David here contemplates with admiration the
   providence of God in the government of mankind. And first of all, he
   exclaims that the wonders of God's works are great or many; [85]
   meaning by this, that God in his inscrutable wisdom so governs human
   affairs, that his works, which come to be little thought of by men,
   from their constant familiarity with them, far surpass the
   comprehension of the human understanding. Thus we find, that from one
   particular species he ascends to the whole class; as if he had said,
   God has proved not only by this particular act the paternal care which
   he exercises towards men, but that, in general, his wonderful
   providence shines forth in the several parts of creation. Then he adds,
   that the counsels of God concerning us are so high and so hidden, that
   it is impossible to reckon them up in order distinctly and agreeably to
   their nature. Some think that the word 'lynv, elenu, towards us, is
   employed by way of comparison, in this sense, The counsels of God are
   far beyond the reach of our understanding, (but David rather commends
   the care which God vouchsafes to take of us;) and as, in this way, the
   connection of the words is broken, they are constrained to render the
   word rvd, aroch, which I have rendered to count in order, differently,
   namely, that none is equal to God, or can be compared with him. [86]
   But that I may not enter upon any lengthened refutation, the
   intelligent reader will agree with me in considering that the true
   meaning is this: That God, by his incomprehensible wisdom, governs the
   world in such a manner that we cannot reckon up his works in their
   proper order, seeing our minds, through their very dulness, fail us
   before we can reach to so great a height. It follows, to thee, for
   although we should in so far reflect how wonderfully the Lord can make
   provision for our wants, yet this consideration is limited by the
   imperfection of our understanding: and hence it falls far short of the
   infinite glory of God. Those who give this explanation, that the
   counsels of God are not referred to him, because the greatest part of
   men imagine that every thing is subject to chance and fortune, as if
   David meant in passing to censure the ingratitude of those who defraud
   God of his praise, are no doubt mistaken as to the meaning. In stating,
   as David does, immediately after, that however much he might set
   himself to rehearse the works of God, he yet would fail ere he could
   declare the half of them; -- in stating this he shows with sufficient
   plainness that the godly and devout meditation, in which the children
   of God are often engaged, gives them only, as it were, a slight taste
   of them and nothing more. We have now arrived then at the Psalmist's
   meaning. Having spoken before of the deliverance which God had
   vouchsafed to him, he takes occasion from it to set forth the general
   providence of God in nourishing and sustaining men. It is also his
   design in this to exhort the faithful to a consideration of God's
   providence, that they may not hesitate to cast all their cares upon it.
   Whilst some are in constant pain by reason of their own anxiety and
   discontent, or quake at the slightest breeze that blows, and others
   labor hard to fortify and preserve their life by means of earthly
   succours, -- all this proceeds from ignorance of the doctrine, that God
   governs the affairs of this world according to his own good pleasure.
   And as the great majority of men, measuring the providence of God by
   their own understanding, wickedly obscure or degrade it, David, placing
   it on its proper footing, wisely removes this impediment. The meaning
   of the sentence, therefore, amounts to this, that in the works of God
   men should reverently admire what they cannot comprehend by their
   reason; and whenever the flesh moves them to contradiction or
   murmuring, they should raise themselves above the world. If God cease
   to work, he seems to be asleep, because, binding up his hands to the
   use of outward means, we do not consider that he works by means which
   are secret. We may therefore learn from this place, that although the
   reason of his works may be hidden or unknown to us, he is nevertheless
   wonderful in his counsels.

   This verse is closely connected with the preceding. No man places, as
   he ought, entire trust in God, but he who, shutting his eyes upon
   external circumstances, suffers himself to be governed by him according
   to his good pleasure. Moreover, having spoken hitherto in the third
   person, David now suddenly addresses his discourse, not, however,
   unadvisedly, to God, that he might lead us the more effectually to this
   sobriety and discretion. When, however, he affirms that the works of
   God cannot be distinctly known by us, it is not for the purpose of
   deterring us from seeking the knowledge of them, or from the
   examination of them, but only to lay a restraint upon our rashness,
   which would otherwise go beyond the proper boundaries in this respect.
   To this end, the words to thee, or before thee, are expressly employed,
   by which we are admonished that however diligently a man may set
   himself to meditate upon the works of God, he can only attain to the
   extremities or borders of them. Although then so great a height be far
   above our reach, we must, notwithstanding, endeavor, as much as in us
   lies, to approach it more and more by continual advances; as we see
   also the hand of God stretched forth to disclose to us, so far as it is
   expedient, those wonders, which we are unable of ourselves to discover.
   There is nothing so preposterous as to affect, of one's own accord, a
   gross ignorance of the providence of God, because as yet we cannot
   comprehend it perfectly, but only discern it in part; even as at this
   day we find some who employ all their endeavors to bury it in oblivion,
   for no other pretense than that it surpasses our understanding, as if
   it were unreasonable to allow to God anything more than what appears
   right and proper, according to our carnal reason. David acts very
   differently regarding it. Feeling all his senses absorbed by an
   inconceivable majesty and brightness, which he could not bear to look
   upon, [87] he confesses frankly that these are wonderful things of
   which he could not comprehend the reason; but still he does not abstain
   wholly and everywhere from making mention of them, but, according to
   the measure of his capacity, sets himself devoutly to meditate upon
   them. From this we learn how foolish and vain a thing it is to say, by
   way of caution, that none should speak of the counsels or purposes of
   God, because they are high and incomprehensible. David, on the
   contrary, though he was ready to sink under the weight, ceased not to
   contemplate them, and abstained not from speaking of them, because he
   felt unequal to the task of rehearsing them, but was content, after
   having declared his faith on this subject, to finish his discourse in
   admiration.

   Psalm 40:6-8

   6. In sacrifice and oblation thou hast not taken pleasure: thou hast
   bored my ears: thou hast not required burnt offering nor sin-offering.
   7. Then I said, Lo! I come: in the roll of the book it is written of
   me, 8. That I may do thy pleasure, O my God! I have delighted to do it,
   and thy law is in the midst of my bowels. (Hebrews 10:5.)


   6 In sacrifice and oblation thou hast not taken pleasure. Here David
   offers not only the sacrifice of praise, or, as the prophet Hosea calls
   it, (Hosea 14:2,) "the calves of the lips," but, in token of his
   gratitude, offers and consecrates himself entirely to God; as if he had
   said, I am now wholly devoted to God, because, having been delivered by
   his wonderful power, I am doubly indebted to him for my life. At the
   same time, treating of the true worship of God, he shows that it
   consists not in outward ceremonies, but rather that it is spiritual.
   Accordingly, the meaning is, that he came into the presence of God not
   only in the outward pomp or ceremony and figures of the law, but that
   he brought with him the true devotion of the heart. We know, indeed,
   that all men have some sense of religion impressed upon their hearts,
   so that no one dares to withdraw openly and wholly from his service,
   and yet the greater part of men turn aside into winding and crooked
   paths; and hence it happens, that in serving God in a perfunctory
   manner, their worship is scarcely anything else than a mockery of him.
   We see then the reason why David, on the present occasion, shows in
   what the true worship of God consists; it is, that he may distinguish
   between himself and hypocrites, who draw near to God with their lips
   only, or at least seek to pacify him with cold and unmeaning
   ceremonies.

   We now come to the exposition of the words. I have no doubt that David,
   under the four different kinds of sacrifices which he here enumerates,
   comprehends all the sacrifices of the law. His meaning, to express it
   in a few words, is, that God requires not mere ceremonies of those who
   serve him, but that he is satisfied only with sincerity of heart, with
   faith and holiness of life: and that he takes no pleasure merely in the
   visible sanctuary, the altar, the burning of incense, the killing of
   beasts, the lights, the costly apparel, and outward washings. From this
   he concludes, that he ought to be guided by another principle, and to
   observe another rule in the service of God, than a mere attention to
   these -- that he should yield himself wholly to God.

   Thou hast bored my ears. Some think that in using this form of
   expression, David has a reference to the ordinance under the Law of
   which we read in Exodus 21:6. If any bond-servant, when the time of his
   being discharged from servitude had arrived, made no account of his
   freedom, he was brought to the public place of judgment, and having
   there declared that he wished to continue in servitude, his master
   pierced his ear with an awl, as a mark of perpetual bondage. But this
   mode of interpretation appears to be too forced and refined. [88]
   Others more simply consider that it is of the same meaning as to render
   fit, or qualify for service, for David mentions not one ear only, but
   both. Men, we know, are naturally deaf, because they are so dull, that
   their ears are stopped until God pierce them. By this expression,
   therefore, is denoted the docility to which we are brought and moulded
   by the grace of the Holy Spirit. I, however, apply this manner of
   expression more closely to the scope of the passage before us, and
   explain it in this sense, That David was not slow and dull of hearing,
   as men usually are, so that he could discern nothing but what was
   earthly in the sacrifices, but that his ears had been cleansed, so that
   he was a better interpreter of the Law, and able to refer all the
   outward ceremonies to the spiritual service of God. He encloses the
   sentence, Thou hast bored my ears, as it were, in parenthesis, whilst
   he is treating professedly of sacrifices, so that the sentence might be
   explained in this way: Lord, thou hast opened my ears, that I may
   distinctly understand whatever thou hast commanded concerning the
   sacrifices, namely, that of themselves they afford thee no pleasure:
   for thou, who art a Spirit, takest no delight in these earthly
   elements, and hast no need of flesh or blood; and, therefore, thou
   requirest something of a higher and more excellent nature. If, however,
   it is objected that sacrifices were offered by the express commandment
   of God, I have just said that David here distinguishes between the
   spiritual service of God, and that which consisted in outward types and
   shadows. And in making this comparison, it is no great wonder to find
   him saying that the sacrifices are of no value, since they were only
   helps designed to lead men to true piety, and tended to a far higher
   end than that which was at first apparent. Seeing, then, God made use
   of these elements, only to lead his people to the exercises of faith
   and repentance, we conclude that he had no delight in being worshipped
   by sacrifices. We must always bear in mind, that whatever is not
   pleasing to God for its own sake, but only in so far as it leads to
   some other end, if it be put in the place of his true worship and
   service is rejected and cast away by him.

   7. Then said I, Lo! I come. By the adverb then he intimates, that he
   had not been a good scholar, and capable of profiting by instruction,
   until God had opened his ears; but as soon as he had been instructed by
   the secret inspirations of the Spirit, he tells us, that then his heart
   was ready to yield a willing and cheerful obedience. Here true
   obedience is very properly distinguished from a constrained and slavish
   subjection. Whatever service, therefore, men may offer to God, it is
   vain and offensive in his sight, unless at the same time they offer
   themselves; and, moreover, this offering of one's self is of no value
   unless it be done willingly. These words, Lo! I come, ought to be
   observed, and likewise the words, I have delighted to do thy will; for
   the Hebrew word chphtsty, chaphatsti, means, I was well pleased, or, I
   willingly condescended. Here David indicates his readiness to yield
   obedience, as well as the cordial affection of his heart and
   persevering resolution. His language implies, that he cordially
   preferred the service of God to every other desire and care, and had
   not only yielded a willing subjection, but also embraced the rule of a
   pious and holy life, with a fixed and steady purpose of adhering to it.
   This he confirms still further in the third clause of the verse, in
   which he says, that the Law of God was deeply fixed in the midst of his
   bowels [89] It follows from this, first, that however beautiful and
   splendid the works of men may appear, yet unless they spring from the
   living root of the heart, they are nothing better than a mere pretense;
   and, secondly, that it is to no purpose that the feet, and hands, and
   eyes, are framed for keeping the Law, unless obedience begin at the
   heart. Moreover, it appears from other places of Scripture, that it is
   the peculiar office of the Holy Spirit to engrave the Law of God on our
   hearts. God, it is true, does not perform his work in us as if we were
   stones or stocks, drawing us to himself without the feeling or inward
   moving of our hearts towards him. But as there is in us naturally a
   will, which, however, is depraved by the corruption of our nature, so
   that it always inclines us to sin, God changes it for the better, and
   thus leads us cordially to seek after righteousness, to which our
   hearts were previously altogether averse. Hence arises that true
   freedom which we obtain when God frames our hearts, which before were
   in thraldom to sin, unto obedience to himself.

   In the roll of the book As the Septuagint has made use of the word head
   instead of roll, [90] some have been inclined to philosophise upon this
   clause with so much refinement of speculation, that they have exposed
   themselves to ridicule by their foolish and silly inventions. But the
   etymology of the word vmglt, bemegilath, is the same as the Latin word
   volumen, [91] which we call a roll It is necessary to ascertain in what
   sense David claims peculiarly to himself what is common or alike to all
   men. Since the Law prescribes to all men the rule of a holy and upright
   life, it does not appear, it may be said, that what is here stated
   pertains to any one man or any set of men. I answer, that although the
   literal doctrine of the Law belongs to all men in common, yet as of
   itself it is dead, and only beats the air, God teaches his own people
   after another manner; and that, as the inward and effectual teaching of
   the Spirit is a treasure which belongs peculiarly to them, it is
   written of them only in the secret book of God, that they should
   fulfill his will. The voice of God, indeed, resounds throughout the
   whole world, so that all who do not obey it are rendered inexcusable;
   but it penetrates into the hearts of the godly alone, for whose
   salvation it is ordained. As a general, therefore, enrols the names of
   his soldiers, that he may know their exact number, and as a
   schoolmaster writes the names of his scholars in a scroll, so has God
   written the names of his children in the book of life, that he may
   retain them under the yoke of his own discipline.

   There still remains another difficulty connected with this passage. The
   Apostle, in Hebrews 10:5, seems to wrest this place, when he restricts
   what is spoken of all the elect to Christ alone, and expressly contends
   that the sacrifices of the Law, which David says are not agreeable to
   God in comparison of the obedience of the heart, are abrogated; and
   when quoting rather the words of the Septuagint, [92] than those of the
   prophet, he infers from them more than David intended to teach. As to
   his restricting this passage to the person of Christ, the solution is
   easy. David did not speak in his own name only, but has shown in
   general what belongs to all the children of God. But when bringing into
   view the whole body of the Church, it was necessary that he should
   refer us to the head itself. It is no objection that David soon after
   imputes to his own sins the miseries which he endures; for it is by no
   means an uncommon thing to find our errors, by a mode of expression not
   strictly correct, transferred to Christ. As to the abrogation of the
   sacrifices that were under the Law, I answer thus: That their
   abrogation may be fairly inferred from the language of the prophets;
   for this is not like many other places in which God condemns and
   rejects the sacrifices which were offered by hypocrites, and which were
   deservedly offensive to him on account of their uncleanness: for in
   these God condemns the outward ceremony, on account of the abuse and
   corruption of it, which rendered it nothing but a vain mockery; whereas
   here, when the Prophet speaks of himself as one who worshipped God
   sincerely, and yet denies that God had pleasure in these sacrifices, it
   may easily be inferred, that the rudiments which God had enjoined upon
   his ancient people for a time had some other end in view, and were only
   like infantile instructions designed to prepare them for some higher
   state. But if their truth and substance are contained in Christ, it is
   certain that they have been abolished by his coming. They were indeed
   still in use in the time of David: and yet he admonishes us that the
   true service of God, even when performed without sacrifices, was
   perfect and complete in all its parts, and every where; and that the
   ceremonies are things which might be regarded as non-essential, and, as
   we speak, adventitious. This is worthy of being noticed, that we may
   know that God, even after he has removed the figures which he had
   commanded for a time, does not cease always to resemble himself; for in
   these outward services he had respect solely to men. As to this, that
   the Apostle, following the Septuagint, has made subservient to his own
   use the word body, which is not used here by David, in such an allusion
   there is no inconsistency; for he does not undertake expressly to
   unfold and explain in every point the Psalmist's meaning: but as he had
   said, that by the one sacrifice of Christ all the others had been
   abolished, he adds at the same time that a body had been prepared for
   Christ, that by the offering up of it he might fulfill the will of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [88] The objections to this interpretation are, 1. That the verb krh
   carah, here used, does not mean to bore, but that the radical idea of
   the word is, to dig, to hollow out; as to dig a well, Genesis 26:25; a
   pit, Psalm 7:15; to carve or cut out a sepulcher from a rock, 2
   Chronicles 16:14; and hence we find it transferred from the grottoes of
   the sepulcher to the quarry of human nature, Isaiah 51:1, 2. Williams,
   viewing the verb as properly signifying digged, carved, or cut out, in
   the sense of forming, explains the words as if the Psalmist had said,
   "Mine ears hast thou made, or prepared, for the most exact and complete
   obedience." Stuart, (Commentary on Hebrews 10:5,) and Davidson, (Sacred
   Hermeneutics, p. 461,) viewing the word as meaning digged, hollowed
   out, simply in the sense of opening, read, "Mine ears hast thou
   opened;" which they explain as meaning, Thou hast made me obedient, or,
   I am entirely devoted to thy service; observing, that to open or
   uncover the ear was a customary expression among the Hebrews, to
   signify a revealing something to any one, including the idea of
   listening to the communication, followed by prompt obedience, Isaiah
   50:5; 1 Samuel. 20:2. There is another verb of the same radical
   letters, which means to purchase or provide; and this is the sense in
   which the LXX. understood krh, carah, as is evident from their
   rendering it by katertiso 2. That the verb used in Exodus is not krh,
   as here, but rts, ratsang 3. That only one ear was pierced, as appears
   from the passages in the Pentateuch in which the rite is described. But
   here the plural number is used, denoting both ears. From these
   considerations, it is concluded that there is here no allusion to the
   custom of boring the ear of a servant under the Law.

   [89] This is the literal rendering of the Hebrew, and means, As dear to
   me as life itself; (John 6:38; Job 38:36.)

   [90] Anciently, books did not consist, like ours, of a number of
   distinct leaves bound together, but were composed of sheets of
   parchment joined to each other, and rolled up for preservation upon
   wooden rollers, as our charts of geography are; and in this form are
   all the sacred MSS. of the Jewish synagogues to this day. The roll of
   the book, therefore, simply means the book itself. With respect to the
   reading of the Septuagint, "En kethalisdi bibliou;" -- "In the head of
   the book;" and which Paul, in Hebrews 10:7, quotes instead of the
   Hebrew: this is an expression which the LXX. employ simply to mean the
   book, as in Ezra 6:2; Ezekiel 2:9; and 3:1-3; and not the beginning or
   head of the book At the extremity of the cylinder on which the Hebrew
   kphr, bibliou, book or manuscript, was rolled, were heads or knobs for
   the sake of convenience to those who used the MS. The knob or head,
   kethalis, is here taken as a part put for the whole Kethalis bibliou
   means therefore bibliou, or sphr, with a kethalis, i e., a manuscript
   roll. -- Stuart on Hebrews 10:7. Hence it is evident, that we are not
   to understand this phrase, the head of the book, as referring to that
   prophecy in Genesis 3:15. As to what book is here referred to, there is
   some diversity of opinion among interpreters. Some understand it to be
   the book of the divine decrees, some the Pentateuch, and others all
   that was written concerning Christ "in the Law of Moses, in the
   Prophets, and in the Psalms."

   [91] Volumen is from volvo, I roll.

   [92] The Septuagint here reads, "Soma de katertiso moi" -- "But a body
   hast thou prepared [or fitted] for me." This reading is widely
   different from that of our Hebrew Bibles; and, to account for it,
   critics and commentators have had recourse to various conjectures: nor
   is the subject without considerable difficulty. Some think that the
   Septuagint has been corrupted, and others the Hebrew. Grotius is of
   opinion, and he is followed by Houbigant, that the original reading of
   the Septuagint was akousma, auditum, which afterwards, in the process
   of transcription, had been changed into soma; while Drs Owen and
   Hammond think that the original reading was otia, ears It is
   conjectured by Kennicott that the Hebrew text has been changed from 'z
   gvt, az gevah, then a body, into 'znvm, aznayim, ears; a conjecture
   which meets with the approbation of Dr Lowth, Dr Adam Clarke, and Dr
   Pye Smith. But it goes far to support the accuracy of the Hebrew text
   as it now stands, that the Syriac, Chaldee, and Vulgate versions agree
   with it, and that in all the MSS. collated by Kennicott and De Rossi
   there is not a single variation. With respect to the Apostle's quoting
   from the Septuagint instead of the Hebrew, it is sufficient to say,
   that he did so because the Septuagint was then in common use. And it is
   worthy of observation, that his argument does not depend on the word,
   soma de katertiso moi: his design is to show the insufficiency of the
   legal sacrifices, and to establish the efficacy of Christ s obedience
   unto death; and his argument would be equally complete had these words
   been omitted: for it is not made to depend on the manner of the
   obedience. -- See Archbishop Secker's able Dissertation on the subject
   in the Appendix to Merrick's Notes on the Psalms; and Stuart on Hebrews
   10:5, and Excursus 20.

   Psalm 40:9-11

   9. I have proclaimed thy righteousness in the great assembly: behold, I
   will not refrain my lips: O Jehovah! thou knowest it. 10. I have not
   hidden thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy truth and
   thy salvation: I have not concealed thy goodness nor thy truth in the
   great assembly. 11. O thou Jehovah! withhold not thy tender mercies
   from me: let thy goodness and thy truth always preserve me.


   9. I have proclaimed thy righteousness in the great assembly. Here
   David again brings forward his own thankfulness, and for no other
   reason but to induce God to continue his goodness towards him. God,
   whenever he manifests his liberality towards us, encourages us to
   render thanks to him; and he continues to act in a similar manner
   towards us when he sees that we are thankful and mindful of what he has
   done for us. In the first place, David makes use simply of the word
   righteousness; but it must be understood of the righteousness of God,
   which he expressly mentions soon after. Nor does he say, that it was
   only in the secret affection of the heart, or in private, that he
   offered praise to God, but that he had openly proclaimed it in the
   solemn assembly, even as the faithful in those days were wont to
   testify their devotion by presenting peace-offerings to God when they
   had been delivered from any great danger. The great assembly of which
   he speaks is not to be understood of the concourse of people that
   assemble at courts of law, or at the public market-places, but it
   denotes the true and lawfully constituted Church of God, which we know
   assembled in the place of his sanctuary. Accordingly, he declares that
   he had not concealed in his heart the righteousness of God, which it
   becomes us publicly to make known for the edification of one another.
   Those who keep it hid in their hearts are surely seeking as much as in
   them lies that the memory of God may be buried in oblivion. He calls
   upon God as a witness of this, not only to distinguish between himself
   and hypocrites, who often proclaim loudly, and with all their might,
   the praises of God, and yet do so without the least spark of affection;
   but also to make it the more abundantly obvious that he had sincerely
   and heartily uttered the praises of God, and was careful not to defraud
   him of any part of them. This affirmation teaches us that the subject
   which is here treated of is one of no small importance; for although
   God stands in no need of our praises, yet it is his will that this
   exercise for many reasons should prevail amongst us.

   10 I have not hidden thy righteousness within my heart. Here it is
   necessary to observe the accumulation of terms which are employed to
   denote the same thing. To the righteousness of God the Psalmist adds
   his truth, his salvation, and his mercy. And what is the design of
   this, but to magnify and set forth the goodness of God by many terms or
   expressions of praise? We must, however, notice in what respects these
   terms differ; for in this way we may be able to ascertain in what
   respects they apply to the deliverance of which David here discourses.
   If these four things should be taken in their proper order, mercy will
   hold the first place, as it is that by which alone God is induced to
   vouchsafe, to regard us. His righteousness is the protection by which
   he constantly defends his own people, and the goodness by which, as we
   have already said elsewhere, he preserves them. And, lest any should
   doubt that it will flow in a constant and uninterrupted course, David
   adds in the third place truth; by which we are taught that God
   continues always the same, and is never wearied of helping us, nor at
   any time withdraws his hand. There is, at the same time, implied in
   this an exhibition of the promises; for no man will ever rightly take
   hold of the righteousness of God but he who embraces it as it is
   offered and held forth in the Word. Salvation is the effect of
   righteousness, for God continues to manifest his free favor to his
   people, daily affording them aid and assistance, until he has
   completely saved them.

   11 O thou Jehovah! withhold not thy tender mercies from me We now see
   more clearly, what I have just adverted to, that David speaks of his
   own thankfulness, that he might secure a continuance of God's favor
   towards him; and that he opened his mouth in the praises of God, that
   he might continue to acquire new favors, against which our perverse and
   ungrateful silence very often closes the gate. We ought, therefore,
   carefully to observe the relation which the clause, in which David
   affirms that he closed not his lips, bears to what follows, namely,
   that God on his part would not contract or stop up the course of his
   tender mercies; for by this we are taught that God would always be
   ready to relieve us by his goodness, or rather that it would flow down
   upon us as from a never-failing fountain, if our own ingratitude did
   not prevent or cut off its course. The tender mercies of God, which he
   expresses by the word rchmyd, rachamecha, and of which he here speaks,
   differ little from his goodness. It was not, however, without cause
   that David chose to make this distinction. It could only be, first,
   because he was unable otherwise to satisfy himself in extolling the
   grace of God; and, secondly, because it was requisite to show that the
   source from which the mercy and goodness of God proceed, when he is
   moved in compassion for our miseries to aid and succor us. Then he
   places his confidence of salvation in the goodness and faithfulness of
   God, for we must of necessity begin (as I have said a little before) at
   the free favor of God, that his bounty may extend even to us. But as we
   are unable to discern that God is gracious to us until he grant us some
   assurance of his love, his constancy is, with much propriety, placed in
   connection with his truth in keeping his promises.

   Psalm 40:12-15

   12. For innumerable evils have compassed me on all sides; my iniquities
   have laid hold upon me, so that I cannot look up: [93] they are more in
   number than the hairs of my head; and my heart has failed me. 13. Be
   thou pleased, O Jehovah! to deliver me: O Jehovah! make haste to help
   me. 14. Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my
   life to destroy it; let them be turned backward, and put to shame, that
   seek after my hurt. 15. Let them be destroyed for a reward of their
   shame who have said to me, [94] Aha, aha!


   12. For innumerable evils have compassed me on all sides This phrase,
   in the original, denotes more than can be expressed in an English
   translation; for he says, ly alay, upon me, meaning by this, that he
   was not only beset on all sides, but that also an accumulation of evils
   pressed upon his head. He, however, does not now complain of being
   punished unjustly, or above his desert, but rather confesses plainly
   that it is the just recompense of his sins which is rendered to him.
   For although the word vn, avon, which we have rendered iniquity,
   signifies also the punishment of iniquity, (as we have elsewhere seen
   more than once;) yet we must take into consideration the derivation of
   the word. [95] Accordingly, since David calls the afflictions which he
   endures the fruit or effect of his transgressions, there is implied in
   this a humble confession, from which we may ascertain with what
   reverence and meekness he submitted to the judgments of God, seeing
   that, when overwhelmed with an accumulation of miseries, he sets forth
   his sins in all their magnitude and aggravation, lest he should suspect
   God of undue severity. When we see David treated so severely, let us
   also learn, when we are oppressed with extreme afflictions, and are
   groaning under them, humbly to implore the grace and mercy of our
   Judge. Nor is it his design to show that he had been stupid or
   hardened, when he says that his heart failed or forsook him. His
   language means, that he was not only broken-hearted, but that he lay as
   if he had been dead. We must, however, understand this fainting or
   failing of the heart as referring to the sense of the flesh; for his
   perseverance in prayer is a certain proof that his faith was never
   altogether extinguished. But since he was, in so far as man was
   concerned, destitute of counsel, and was altogether without strength,
   it is not without cause that he says that his heart failed him.

   13. Be thou pleased, O Jehovah! to deliver me. The verb which David
   here makes use of, signifies to desire a thing from pure kindness and
   good-will. [96] He desires, therefore, to be delivered by the free
   mercy of God. As to his desire, that God would make haste, we have
   elsewhere spoken of it. Even when God delays to help us, it is our duty
   to contend against a feeling of weariness; but such is his goodness,
   that he permits us to use this form of prayer, That he would make haste
   according to our desires. Then, according to his usual practice, citing
   his enemies to the judgment-seat of God, he feels confident, that, on
   account of their cruelty, and unjust and wicked hatred, he shall obtain
   what he asks. We must maintain it as a fixed principle, that the more
   unjustly our enemies afflict us, and the more cruelly they wrong us,
   God is so much the more disposed to give us help. And it is no slight
   consolation that the mercy of God strives against their wickedness, so
   that the more fiercely our enemies pursue us to effect our hurt, the
   more ready is he to bring us help. We have already frequently spoken of
   the feelings with which David uttered these imprecations, and it is
   necessary here again to refresh our memories on the subject, lest any
   man, when giving loose reins to his passions, should allege the example
   of David in palliation or excuse. This wicked and counterfeit imitation
   on the part of those who follow the powerful impulse of the flesh,
   instead of being guided by the zeal of the Spirit, is always to be held
   up to condemnation.

   When the Psalmist prays (verse 15) that his enemies may be destroyed
   for a reward of their shame, the meaning is this: As their sole desire
   has been to overwhelm me with shame, in order that, while thus dismayed
   and confounded, they might make me the object of their derision; so let
   a similar confusion fall upon their own heads. In the second clause of
   the verse he describes the nature of this confusion by relating the
   terms of their wicked triumphing, by which they poured contempt upon
   him while he was so oppressed with misery and affliction. We are here
   taught that, when our enemies shall have persecuted us to the
   uttermost, a recompense is also prepared for them; and that God will
   turn back, and cause to fall upon their own heads, all the evil which
   they had devised against us; and this doctrine ought to act as a
   restraint upon us, that we may behave ourselves compassionately and
   kindly towards our neighbors.

   Psalm 40:16-17

   16. Let all those that seek thee be glad and rejoice in thee: and let
   those that love thy salvation say continually, Jehovah be magnified!
   17. But I am poor and needy: Jehovah hath regarded me; thou art my help
   and my deliverer: O thou my God! make no delay.


   16. Let all those that seek thee be glad and rejoice in thee. David
   here uses another argument -- one which he often adduces elsewhere --
   in order to obtain deliverance; not that it is necessary to allege
   reasons to persuade God, but because it is profitable to confirm our
   faith by such supports. As, then, it is the will of God that he should
   be known in his gracious character, not only of one or two, but
   generality of all men, whenever he vouchsafes deliverance to any of his
   children, it is a common benefit which all the faithful ought to apply
   to themselves when they see in the person of one man in what manner
   God, who is never inconsistent with himself, will act towards all his
   people. David, therefore, shows that he asks nothing for himself
   individually but what pertains to the whole Church. He prays that God
   would gladden the hearts of all the saints, or afford them all common
   cause of rejoicing: so that, assured of his readiness to help them,
   they may have recourse to him with greater alacrity. Hence we conclude,
   that, in the case of every individual, God gives a proof of his
   goodness towards us. What is added, those that love thy salvation, is
   also worthy of being observed by us. We may infer from this, that our
   faith is only proved to be genuine when we neither expect nor desire
   preservation otherwise than from God alone. Those who devise various
   ways and means of preservation for themselves in this world, despise
   and reject the salvation which God has taught us to expect from him
   alone. What had been said before, those who seek thee, is to the same
   purpose. If any individual would depend wholly upon God, and desire to
   be saved by his grace, he must renounce every vain hope, and employ all
   his thoughts towards the reception of his strength. Here, again, we
   must observe that two things are contrasted with each other. Formerly
   David had said that the wicked sought his life; now he ascribes to the
   faithful quite a contrary feeling, namely, that they seek God. In like
   manner he had related the reproaches and derision of the ungodly, while
   they said, Aha, aha! and now he introduces the godly speaking very
   differently, saying, The Lord be magnified!

   17. But I am poor and needy. In this concluding clause he mingles
   prayer with thanksgiving, although it may be that he records a request
   which he had made when he was placed in extreme danger. The first
   clause of the verse might be rendered thus: Although I was miserable
   and poor, God did think upon me. As according to the extent in which
   any one is afflicted, so is he despised by the world, we imagine that
   he is disregarded by God, we must, therefore, steadfastly maintain that
   our miseries in no respect produce on the part of God a feeling of
   weariness towards us, so that it should become troublesome to him to
   aid us. In this way, however, let us rather read the clause: When I was
   miserable and poor, the Lord looked upon my necessity: So that by this
   circumstance he enhances the grace of God. If God anticipate us with
   his goodness, and do not wait till adversity presses upon us, then his
   favor towards us is not so apparent. This comparison, therefore,
   illustrates very clearly the glory of God in the deliverance of David,
   inasmuch as he vouchsafed to stretch forth his hand to a man who was
   despised and rejected of all men, nay, who was destitute of all help
   and hope. Now, if it was necessary that David should have been reduced
   to this extremity, it is no wonder if persons in a more private station
   are often humbled after this manner, that they may feel and acknowledge
   in good earnest that they have been delivered out of despair by the
   hand of God. The simple and natural meaning of the prayer is this,
   Lord, thou art my help and my deliverer, therefore delay not to come to
   my aid. As it is a foolish thing to approach God with a doubtful and
   wavering mind, the Psalmist takes courage, as he was wont to do from
   his own experience, and persuades himself that the help of God, by
   which he had been hitherto preserved, would not fail him.

   PSALM 41

   David, while he was severely afflicted by the hand of God, perceived
   that he was unjustly blamed by men who regarded him as one who had
   already been condemned and devoted to eternal destruction. Under this
   trial he fortifies himself by the consolation of hope. At the same
   time, he complains partly of the cruelty, and partly of the treachery,
   of his enemies. And although he recognises the affliction with which he
   is visited as a just punishment of his sins, yet he charges his enemies
   with cruelty and malice, inasmuch as they troubled and afflicted one
   who had always endeavored to do them good. Finally, he records an
   expression of his gratitude and joy, because he had been preserved by
   the grace of God.

   Psalm 41:1-3

   1. Blessed is he that judgeth wisely of the poor: [97] Jehovah will
   deliver him [98] in the day of evil. 2. Jehovah will keep him, and
   preserve him in life: he shall be blessed upon the earth; [99] and thou
   wilt not abandon him to the will of his enemies. 3. Jehovah will
   support [100] him upon the bed of sorrow: thou hast turned all his bed
   in his sickness.


   1. Blessed is he that judgeth wisely of the poor. Interpreters are
   generally of opinion that the exercise of kindness and compassion
   manifested in taking care of the miserable, and helping them, is here
   commended. Those, however, who maintain that the Psalmist here commends
   the considerate candour of those who judge wisely and charitably of men
   in adversity, form a better judgment of his meaning. Indeed, the
   participle mskyl, maskil, cannot be explained in any other way. At the
   same time, it ought to be observed on what account it is that David
   declares those to be blessed who form a wise and prudent judgment
   concerning the afflictions by which God chastises his servants. We have
   said that he had to contend in his own heart against the perverse
   judgments of foolish and wicked men, because, when affliction was
   pressing heavily upon him, many considered that he had fallen into a
   desperate condition, and was altogether beyond the hope of recovery.
   Doubtless, it happened to him as it did to the holy patriarch Job, whom
   his friends reckoned to be one of the most wicked of men, when they saw
   God treating him with great severity. And certainly it is an error
   which is by far too common among men, to look upon those who are
   oppressed with afflictions as condemned and reprobate. As, on the one
   hand, the most of men, judging of the favor of God from an uncertain
   and transitory state of prosperity, applaud the rich, and those upon
   whom, as they say, fortune smiles; so, on the other hand, they act
   contemptuously towards the wretched and miserable, and foolishly
   imagine that God hates them, because he does not exercise so much
   forbearance towards them as he does towards the reprobate. The error of
   which we speak, namely, that of judging wrongfully and wickedly, is one
   which has prevailed in all ages of the world. The Scriptures in many
   places plainly and distinctly declare, that God, for various reasons,
   tries the faithful by adversities, at one time to train them to
   patience, at another to subdue the sinful affections of the flesh, at
   another to cleanse, and, as it were, purify them from the remaining
   desires of the flesh, which still dwell within them; sometimes to
   humble them, sometimes to make them an example to others, and at other
   times to stir them up to the contemplation of the divine life. For the
   most part, indeed, we often speak rashly and indiscriminately
   concerning others, and, so to speak, plunge even into the lowest abyss
   those who labor under affliction. To restrain such a rash and unbridled
   spirit, David says that they are blessed who do not suffer themselves,
   by speaking at random, to judge harshly of their neighbors; but,
   discerning aright the afflictions by which they are visited, mitigate,
   by the wisdom of the Spirit, the severe and unjust judgments to which
   we are naturally so prone. I have just adduced as an example the case
   of Job, whom his friends, when they saw him involved in extreme misery,
   hesitated not to account an outcast, and one whose case was altogether
   hopeless. [101] If any one endued with candour, and possessed of a
   humane disposition, should meet with such a case, he would regard it in
   the exercise of the same discretion which David here commends. As to
   ourselves, being admonished by this testimony of the Holy Spirit, let
   us learn to guard against a too precipitate judgment. We must therefore
   judge prudently of our brethren who are in affliction; that is to say,
   we must hope well of their salvation, lest, if we condemn them
   unmercifully before the time, this unjust severity in the end fall upon
   our own heads. It ought, however, especially to be observed, what
   indeed I have already noticed, that the object which David had in view,
   when he saw himself, as it were, overwhelmed by the malicious and cruel
   judgments which were expressed concerning him, was to fortify himself
   by this as a ground of consolation, lest he should sink under the
   temptation. If, therefore, at any time Satan should endeavor to destroy
   the foundation of our faith, by the rash and presumptuous judgments of
   men, let us also learn to have recourse to this device of wisdom, lest
   unawares we fall into despair. This is the proper use of the doctrine
   contained in this passage.

   The Lord will deliver him in the day of evil. Some connect these words,
   in the day of evil, with the preceding clause; and the reading thus
   suggested might indeed be admitted; but the distinction which I have
   followed is better adapted to the sense, and is also supported by the
   Hebrew accent. Thus at least the doctrine deducible from these words is
   susceptible of a fuller meaning, namely, that the Lord will deliver the
   poor in the day of his adversity. Some think that David here prays for
   a blessing in behalf of the upright and compassionate; as if he had
   said, May the Lord himself recompense them again for their kindness, if
   at any time it happen that they are grievously afflicted! Others
   suppose that David here records the language of such men from which we
   may come to the knowledge of their wisdom and uprightness. In my
   opinion, however, both are equally in error in reading this clause in
   the form of a desire or prayer. Whether, indeed, David speaks in his
   own name, or in the name of others, he briefly recommends and enjoins
   the kindness which we ought to exercise towards the afflicted; for
   although God may for a time manifest his displeasure against them, yet
   he will, nevertheless, be gracious to them, so that the issue will at
   length be happier and more joyful than the judgment we might be led to
   form from the present aspect of things. We now see that the sense in
   which I have explained this verse is much more copious and fuller of
   meaning, namely, that we ought to hope for salvation and deliverance
   from the hand of the Lord, even in the day of adversity; for otherwise,
   no man who had once fallen into a state of sorrow and sadness would
   ever be able to rise again. And this I say, because the design of the
   Holy Spirit in this passage is not only to exhort the faithful to be
   ready in showing kindness towards their brethren when they see them in
   affliction, but also to point out the remedy which has been provided
   for the mitigation of our sorrow, whenever our faith is shaken by
   adversity.

   2. Jehovah will keep him, and preserve him in life. Here David follows
   out the same sentiment expressed in the preceding verse, when he says
   that the Lord will keep the afflicted, whose destruction cruel and
   unjust men represent as inevitable. It is likewise necessary always to
   bear in mind the contrast which is stated between the day of evil and
   the blessing of deliverance. In this verse the expressions denoting
   restoration to life, and blessedness on the earth, are of similar
   import. By these expressions, David means to show that although he had
   been to all appearance a dead man, yet the hope of life both for
   himself and for all the faithful had not been extinguished. There
   might, it is true, appear some inconsistency in his promising himself a
   happy life in this world, seeing our condition here would be miserable
   indeed if we had not the expectation of a better state in the world to
   come. But the answer to this is, that as many had despaired of his
   recovery, he expressly declares that he will yet be restored to his
   former state, and will continue alive, nay, that in him there will be
   seen manifest tokens of the favor of God. He does not in the least
   exclude by these expressions the hope of a better life after death.
   What follows concerning the bed of sorrow has led some to form a
   conjecture which, in my opinion, is not at all probable. What David
   says of affliction in general, without determining what kind of
   affliction, they regard as applicable exclusively to sickness. But it
   is no uncommon thing for those who are sorrowful and grieved in their
   minds to throw themselves upon their bed, and to seek repose; for the
   hearts of men are sometimes more distressed by grief than by sickness.
   It is, certainly, highly probable that David was at that time afflicted
   with some very heavy calamity, which might be a token that God was not
   a little displeased with him. In the second clause of the verse there
   is some obscurity. Some understand the expression, turning the bed, in
   the same sense as if God, in order to give some alleviation to his
   servant in the time of trouble, had made his bed and arranged it, as we
   are wont to do to those who are sick, that they may lay themselves more
   softly. [102] Others hold, and, in my opinion, more correctly, that
   when David was restored to health, his bed, which had formerly served
   him as a sick couch, was turned, that is to say, changed. [103] Thus
   the sense would be, that although he now languish in sorrow, whilst the
   Lord is chastening him and training him by means of affliction, yet in
   a little while he will experience relief by the hand of the same God,
   and thus recover his strength.

   and made anew! and this is the way in which God refreshes and relieves
   the merciful man in his sickness. He acts towards him the part of a
   kind nurse, turning and shaking his whole couch, and thus making it
   easy and comfortable for him.

   Psalm 41:4-6

   4. I have said, O Jehovah! Have mercy upon me: heal my soul, for I have
   sinned against thee. 5. My enemies have spoken evil of me, When shall
   he die, and his name perish? 6. And if he come to see me, he speaketh
   lies: his heart heapeth up iniquity to himself; when he shall have gone
   forth he will tell it.


   4. I have said, O Jehovah! have mercy upon me. By this verse he shows
   that in his adversity he did not seek to soothe his mind by flattery,
   as the greater part of men do, who endeavor to assuage their sorrows by
   some vain consolation. And, certainly, the man who is guided by the
   Spirit of God will, when warned of God by the afflictions with which he
   is visited, frankly acknowledge his sins, and quietly submit to the
   admonitions of his brethren, nay, he will even anticipate them by a
   voluntary confession. David here lays down a mark by which he
   distinguishes himself from the reprobate and wicked, when he tells us
   that he earnestly entreated that his sin might not be laid to his
   charge, and that he had sought refuge in the mercy of God. He indeed
   requests that some alleviation might be granted to him under the
   affliction which he endured: but he rises to a higher source of relief,
   when he asks that through the forgiveness of his sins he might obtain
   reconciliation to God. Those, as we have said elsewhere, invert the
   natural order of things, who seek a remedy only for the outward
   miseries under which they labor, but all the while neglect the cause of
   them; acting as a sick man would do who sought only to quench his
   thirst, but never thought of the fever under which he labors, and which
   is the chief cause of his trouble. Before David, therefore, speaks at
   all of the healing of his soul, that is to say, of his life [104] he
   first says, Have mercy upon me: and with this we must connect the
   reason which immediately follows -- for I have sinned against thee. In
   saying so, he confesses that God is justly displeased with him, and
   that he can only be restored again to his favor by his sins being
   blotted out. I take the particle ky, ki, in its proper and natural
   signification, and not adversatively, as some would understand it. He
   asks then that God would have mercy upon him because he had sinned.
   From that proceeds the healing of the soul, which he interposes between
   his prayer and confession, as being the effect of the compassion and
   mercy of God; for David expects that as soon as he had obtained
   forgiveness, he would also obtain relief from his affliction.

   5. My enemies have spoken evil of me. To speak is here used in the
   sense of to imprecate. In thus describing the unbecoming conduct of his
   enemies, he seeks, as has been elsewhere said, to induce God to have
   mercy upon him: because the more that God sees his own people cruelly
   treated, he is so much the more disposed mercifully to succor them.
   Thus David, by his own example, stirs up and encourages us to greater
   confidence in God; because the more that our enemies break forth in
   their cruelty towards us, so much the more does it procure for us favor
   in the sight of God. The terms in which his enemies uttered this
   imprecation show how cruel their hatred had been towards him, since it
   could only be appeased by his destruction, and that, too, accompanied
   with shame and ignominy; for they wished that with his life the very
   remembrance of his name should also be blotted out.

   6. And if he come to see me, he speaketh lies. What is contained in
   this verse relates to his false and treacherous friends. Those who were
   his professed enemies made no secret of their enmity against him, but
   openly persecuted him; and that he has already shown in the preceding
   verse. In addition to this, he now complains that many came to him with
   professions of attachment to him, as if they had been his friends, who,
   nevertheless, afterwards poured forth their malicious ill-will in
   secret against him. Enemies of this sort, who thus cover and conceal
   their malice, and insinuate themselves under the mask of a fair
   appearance, only for the purpose of secretly doing us mischief, are
   indeed much more to be feared than those who openly declare their
   wicked intentions. Accordingly, having complained of his open enemies,
   he proceeds to speak of his pretended friends, of whom he declares that
   they come to see him with no other design than to speak lies, and yet
   that they are meanwhile devising some deceitful and malicious purpose
   against him, nay, that they are even secretly heaping up iniquity, and,
   so to speak, laying it up in store in their hearts; and then he adds,
   that when they have gone forth from his presence, they manifest their
   hypocrisy and deceitfulness.

   Psalm 41:7-9

   7. All they that hate me whisper together against me: they plot
   mischief against me. 8. An evil deed of Belial cleaveth fast to him:
   and he that lieth down shall never be able to rise again. 9. Even the
   man of my peace, in whom I trusted, who eats of my bread, has lifted up
   the heel against me.


   7. All they that hate me whisper together against me. Here he seems
   generally to include both classes of his enemies; those who sought to
   oppress him in an open manner, and in the character of avowed enemies;
   and those who, under the pretense of friendship, attempted to do the
   same thing by deceit and stratagem. Accordingly, he says that all of
   them took counsel together about his destruction, just as we know that
   wicked men hold much secret consultation respecting their intended
   deeds of treachery, and whisper to one another concerning them. Hence
   he adds the words to meditate, or plot, which he employs to denote
   their base conspiracies and sinful consultations.

   8. An evil deed of Belial cleaved fast to him. From this verse it
   appears that they had thus conspired together for his destruction, on
   the ground that they regarded him as a wicked man, and a person worthy
   of a thousand deaths. The insolence and arrogance which they manifested
   towards him proceeded from the false and wicked judgment which they had
   formed concerning him, and of which he made mention in the beginning of
   the psalm. They say, therefore, that an evil deed of Belial holds him
   shut up, and, as it were, bound fast. This the verb ytsvq, yatsuk,
   properly signifies; but in translating the verse I have followed the
   rendering which is most commonly received, reading cleaveth fast to
   him, etc. This expression is by others rendered spreadeth upon him, but
   this interpretation seems to me to be too constrained. As to the word
   Belial, we have already spoken of it in the eighteenth psalm. But as
   grammarians maintain that it is compounded of vly, beli, and yl, yaäl,
   which signify not to rise, the expression, thing of Belial, (for so it
   is literally in the Hebrew,) I understand in this place as meaning an
   extraordinary and hateful crime, which, as we commonly say, can never
   be expiated, and from which there is no possibility of escape; unless,
   perhaps, some would rather refer it to the affliction itself under
   which he labored, as if his enemies had said that he was seized by some
   incurable malady. [105] But whatever may be as to this, his enemies
   regarded it as absolutely certain that God was altogether hostile to
   him, and would never be reconciled towards him, since he was chastising
   him with so much severity. When they add in the following clause, he
   shall never be able to rise again, [106] this clearly shows that they
   utterly cut off from him all hope of recovery. And certainly it was a
   sore temptation to David, who had in himself the testimony of a good
   conscience, to think that he was regarded by men as one who was pursued
   by the vengeance of God, nay, that they even cast him headlong into
   hell. But it pleased God thus to try his servant, that, trusting to the
   testimony of his own conscience, he should pay no regard to what men
   might say, or be troubled by the reproaches they might cast upon him.
   It was also his design to teach us, by his example, that we must seek
   the reward of our righteousness elsewhere than in this world, since we
   see with what unequal balances the world often sets itself to estimate
   the difference between virtue and vice.

   9. Even the man of my peace. As the very height of all his miseries,
   David here declares that he had found the same treachery in some one,
   or, indeed, in many of his greatest friends. For the change of number
   is very frequent in the Hebrew language, so that he may speak of
   several individuals as if they were only one person. Thus the meaning
   would be: Not only the common people, or strangers of whom I had no
   knowledge or acquaintance, but my greatest friends, nay, even those
   with whom I was most intimate, and those of my own household, whom I
   admitted to eat and drink with me at my table, vaunt themselves
   reproachfully against me. Among the Hebrews, the expression, men of
   peace, denotes their kinsfolk and connections; but it was a much closer
   alliance, and one which ought to have secured a stricter observance of
   the laws of friendship, to eat the bread of David in company with
   himself: for it is as if he had employed the appellation, My companion.
   [107] If, however, any would rather understand it of some particular
   traitor than of several persons, I have no objection to it. To lift up
   the heel is, in my opinion, to be understood metaphorically, and
   signifies to rise up disdainfully against a man who is afflicted and
   cast down. [108] Others explain the expression by to lay wait secretly;
   but the former interpretation is more appropriate, That the wicked,
   seeing that David was placed in embarrassed circumstances, or already
   prostrated in the dust, took occasion from this to assail him
   indirectly indeed, but, nevertheless, always with insolence; a thing
   which usually happens among people of a wicked and servile disposition.
   Christ, in quoting this passage, (John 13:18,) applies it to the person
   of Judas. And certainly we ought to understand that, although David
   speaks of himself in this psalm, yet he speaks not as a common and
   private person, but as one who represented the person of Christ,
   inasmuch as he was, as it were, the example after which the whole
   Church should be conformed -- a point well entitled to our attention,
   in order that each of us may prepare himself for the same condition. It
   was necessary that what was begun in David should be fully accomplished
   in Christ; and, therefore, it must of necessity come to pass, that the
   same thing should be fulfilled in each of his members, namely, that
   they should not only suffer from external violence and force, but also
   from internal foes, ever ready to betray them, even as Paul declares
   that the Church shall be assailed, not only by "fightings without," but
   also by "fears within," (2 Corinthians 7:5.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   [105] There seems some difficulty as to what is meant by the words lyl,
   debar beliyaäl They are literally a word of Belial But word in Hebrew
   is often used for a thing or matter, Exodus 18:16; Deuteronomy 17:4; 1
   Kings 14:13. And Belial is used by the Hebrews to designate any
   detestable wickedness. Thus the original words bring out the meaning
   which Calvin fixes upon them; and in the same sense they are understood
   by several critics. Dr Geddes reads "a lawless deed;" and he explains
   the expression as referring to "David's sin in the case of Uriah; which
   his enemies now assign as the cause of his present calamity; as if they
   had said, This sin hath at length overtaken him,' etc." Horsley reads,
   "Some cursed thing presseth heavily upon him;" and by "some cursed
   thing" he understands "the crime which they supposed to be the cause of
   the divine judgment upon him." Fry reads, "Some hellish crime cleaveth
   unto him." Cresswell adopts the interpretation of M. Flaminius: "They
   say, Some load of iniquity presses upon him, (or clings to him,) so
   that from the place where he lieth he will rise no more." But there is
   another sense which the words will bear. The Septuagint reads, "logos
   paranomos;" the Vulgate, "a wicked word;" the Chaldee, "a perverse
   word;" the Syriac, "a word of iniquity;" and the Arabic, "words
   contrary to law;" and so the expression may mean a grievous slander or
   calumny. This is the sense in which it is understood by Hammond. "And
   this," says he, "is said to cleave to him on whom it is fastened; it
   being the nature of calumnies, when strongly affixed on any, to cleave
   fast, and leave some evil mark behind them: "Calumniare fortiter,
   aliquid hoerebit." In our vulgar version it is "an evil disease." And
   dvr, debar, no doubt sometimes signifies a plague or pestilence
   According to this rendering, the sense will be, he is smitten with an
   evil disease on account of his crimes, from which he will never
   recover.

   [106] So Hammond reads with our English version, Now that he lieth he
   shall rise again no more, and thinks that this is a proverbial phrase
   which was in use among the Hebrews, and which was applied to any sort
   of ruin, as well as to that which is effected by bodily disease. "The
   calumniator," he observes, "may destroy and ruin as well as the
   pestilence; and from him was David's danger most frequently, and not
   from a pestilential disease."

   [107] "Mon compagnon ordinaire, et qui estoit a pot et a feu avec moy,
   ainsi qu'on dit en commun proverbe." -- Fr. "My usual companion, and
   one who, according to the common proverb, had bed and board with me."

   [108] "Hath lifted against me his heel; i.e. hath spurned me, hath
   kicked at me, as a vicious beast of burden does, hath insulted me in my
   misery. Comp. Psalm 36:11." -- Cresswell.

   Psalm 41:10-13

   10. Do thou, O Jehovah! have mercy upon me: raise me up, and I will
   recompense them. 11. By this I know that I have been acceptable to
   thee, because my enemy doth not triumph over me. 12. And as for me,
   thou wilt uphold me in my integrity, [109] and establish me before thy
   face for ever. 13. Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, for ever and
   ever. Amen and Amen.


   10 Do thou, O Jehovah I have mercy upon me. From a consideration of the
   wrongful cruelty of his enemies, he again takes encouragement to pray.
   And there is included in what he says a tacit contrast between God and
   men; as if he had said, Since there is to be found no aid or help in
   the world, but as, on the contrary, a strange degree of cruelty, or
   secret malice, every where prevails, be thou, at least, O Lord! pleased
   to succor me by thy mercy. This is the course which ought to be pursued
   by all the afflicted, whom the world unjustly persecutes; that is to
   say, they ought not only to occupy themselves in bewailing the wrongs
   which are done them, but they ought also to commend their cause to God:
   and the more Satan endeavors to overthrow their faith, and to distract
   their thoughts, the more should they fix their minds attentively on God
   alone. In using such language, the Psalmist again ascribes his
   restoration to the mercy of God as its cause. What he says in the
   concluding clause of the verse of taking vengeance seems harsh and
   unaccountable. If he confessed truly and from the heart, in the
   preceding part of the psalm, that God was just in thus afflicting him,
   why does he not extend forgiveness to others, as he desires that
   forgiveness should be granted to himself? Surely it were a shameful
   abuse of the grace of God, if, after having been restored and pardoned
   by him, we should refuse to follow his example in showing mercy.
   Besides, it would have been a feeling far removed from that of humility
   or kindness, for David, even while he was yet in the midst of death, to
   have desired revenge. But here two things are to be taken into account:
   First, David was not as one of the common people, but a king appointed
   by God, and invested with authority; and, secondly, It is not from an
   impulse of the flesh, but in virtue of the nature of his office, that
   he is led to denounce against his enemies the punishment which they had
   merited. If, then, each individual indiscriminately, in taking
   vengeance upon his enemies, should allege the example of David in his
   own defense, it is necessary, first, to take into account the
   difference which subsists between us and David, by reason of the
   circumstances and position in which he was placed by God; [110] and,
   secondly, it is necessary to ascertain whether the same zeal which was
   in him reigns also in us, or rather, whether we are directed and
   governed by the same divine Spirit. David, being king, was entitled, in
   virtue of his royal authority, to execute the vengeance of God against
   the wicked; but as to us our hands are tied. In the second place, As he
   represented the person of Christ, so he cherished in his heart pure and
   holy affections: and hence it is, that, in speaking as he does in this
   verse, he indulged not his own angry spirit, but fulfilled faithfully
   the duties of the station to which he had been called of God. In short,
   in acting thus, he executed the righteous judgment of God, just in the
   same way as it is lawful for us to pray that the Lord himself would
   take vengeance upon the ungodly; for, as we are not armed with the
   power of the sword, it is our duty to have recourse to the heavenly
   Judge. At the same time, in beseeching him to show himself our guardian
   and defender, by taking vengeance on our enemies, we must do so in a
   calm and composed state of mind, and exercise a watchful care lest we
   should give too loose reins to our desires, by casting off the rule
   prescribed by the Spirit. As to David, the duties of his station
   required that he should employ means for subduing the rebellious, and
   that he should be truly the minister of God in inflicting punishment
   upon all the wicked.

   11 By this I know that I have been acceptable to thee David now
   proceeds to the exercise of thanksgiving; unless, indeed, by altering
   the tense of the verb, we would rather with some read this verse in
   connection with the preceding, in this way: In this I shall know that
   thou favorest me, if thou suffer not my enemies to triumph over me; but
   it suits much better to understand it as an expression of joy on
   account of some deliverance which God had vouchsafed to him. After
   having offered up his prayers, he now ascribes his deliverance to God,
   and speaks of it as a manifest and singular benefit he had received
   from him. It might, however, be asked, whether it is a sufficiently
   sure method of our coming to the knowledge of God's love towards us,
   that he does not suffer our enemies to triumph over us? for it will
   often happen, that a man is delivered from danger, whom, nevertheless,
   God does not regard with pleasure; and, besides, the good-will of God
   towards us is known chiefly from his word, and not simply by
   experience. The answer to this is easy: David was not destitute of
   faith, but for the confirmation of it he took advantage of the helps
   which God had afterwards added to his word. In speaking thus, he seems
   to refer not only to the favor and good-will which God bears to all the
   faithful in common, but to the special favor which God had conferred
   upon him in choosing him to be king; as if he had said, Now, Lord, I am
   more and more confirmed in the belief that thou hast vouchsafed to
   adopt me to be the first-born among the kings of the earth. Thus he
   extends to the whole state of the realm the help of God, by means of
   which he had been delivered from some particular calamity.

   12 And as for me, thou wilt uphold me in my integrity Some expound the
   clause thus: That, as David followed after uprightness, God had
   stretched out the hand to him. But this interpretation does not agree
   very well with a preceding sentence, in which he acknowledged that he
   had been justly punished by God. The calamity which had befallen him
   exposed him to the insult and derision of his enemies; but it is not
   likely that they were the authors of it: and hence, it would have been
   out of place to have adduced his integrity for this purpose, because
   the Lord is said to have respect to our integrity, when he defends us
   against our enemies, and delivers us from the outrage of men. We must
   therefore seek another meaning. The Hebrew word which we have rendered
   integrity might be referred to the body as well as the mind, thus: I
   shall continue sound, because thou wilt preserve and establish me. He
   seems, however, to extend the favor of God still farther; as if he had
   said, that he had been assisted not only once by his hand, but that,
   during the whole course of the period he had enjoyed prosperity, he had
   always been upheld in safety by the power of God. If any would rather
   understand by this term the piety and sincere disposition for which
   David was distinguished, -- and this meaning would be very suitable, --
   it will not follow from this that David boasts of his past life, but
   only that he declares that, when brought to the test, or in the midst
   of the conflict, even although Satan and wicked men endeavored to shake
   his faith, he had not turned aside from the fear of God. By these
   words, then, he bears testimony to his patience, because, when sorely
   vexed and tormented, he had not forsaken the path of uprightness. If
   this meaning should be adopted, it must be observed, that this benefit,
   namely, that David continued invincible, and boldly sustained these
   assaults of temptation, is immediately after ascribed to God, and that
   for the future, David looked for preservation by no other means than by
   the sustaining power of God. If the language should be understood as
   referring to his external condition, this will be found to suit equally
   well the scope of the passage, and the meaning will be this, That God
   will never cease to manifest his favor, until he has preserved his
   servants in safety, even to the end. As to the form of expression, that
   God establishes them before his face, this is said of those whom he
   defends and preserves in such a manner, that he shows by evident tokens
   the paternal care which he exercises over them; as, on the other hand,
   when he seems to have forgotten his own people, he is said to hide his
   face from them.

   13 Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, for ever and ever [111] Here
   the Psalmist confirms and repeats the expression of thanksgiving
   contained in a preceding verse. By calling God expressly the God of
   Israel, he testifies that he cherished in his heart a deep and thorough
   impression of the covenant which God had made with the Fathers; because
   it was the source from which his deliverance proceeded. The term amen
   is repeated twice, to express the greater vehemence, and that all the
   godly might be the more effectually stirred up to praise God.

   [109] Or soundness.

   [110] "Pour raison de la condition et estat qu'il avoit de Dieu." --
   Fr.

   [111] The Hebrew Psalter is divided into five books. This is the end of
   the first book. The second ends with the 72d psalm, the third with the
   89th, the fourth with the 106th, and the fifth with the 150th. It is
   worthy of remark, that each of these five books solemnly concludes with
   a distinct ascription of praise to God; only no distinct doxology
   appears at the end of the fifth book, probably because the last psalm
   throughout is a psalm of praise. The Jewish writers affirm that this
   form of benediction was added by the person who collected and
   distributed The Psalms into their present state. How ancient this
   division is, cannot now be clearly ascertained. Jerome, in his Epistle
   to Marcella, and Epiphanius, speak of The Psalms as having been divided
   by the Hebrews into five books; but when this division was made, they
   do not inform us. The forms of ascription of praise, added at the end
   of each of the five books, are in the Septuagint version, from which we
   may conclude that this distribution had been made before that version
   was executed. It was probably made by Ezra, after the return of the
   Jews from Babylon to their own country, and the establishment of the
   worship of God in the new temple; and it was perhaps made in imitation
   of a similar distribution of the books of Moses. In making this
   division of the Hebrew Psalter, regard appears to have been paid to the
   subject-matter of the psalms.

   PSALM 42

   In the first place, David shows that when he was forced to flee by
   reason of the cruelty of Saul, and was living in a state of exile, what
   most of all grieved him was, that he was deprived of the opportunity of
   access to the sanctuary; for he preferred the service of God to every
   earthly advantage. In the second place, he shows that being tempted
   with despair, he had in this respect a very difficult contest to
   sustain. In order to strengthen his hope, he also introduces prayer and
   meditation on the grace of God. Last of all, he again makes mention of
   the inward conflict which he had with the sorrow which he experienced.

   To the chief musician. A lesson of instruction to the sons of Korah.

   The name of David is not expressly mentioned in the inscription of this
   psalm. Many conjecture that the sons of Korah were the authors of it.
   This, I think, is not at all probable. As it is composed in the person
   of David, who, it is well known, was endued above all others with the
   spirit of prophecy, who will believe that it was written and composed
   for him by another person? He was the teacher generally of the whole
   Church, and a distinguished instrument of the Spirit. He had already
   delivered to the company of the Levites, of whom the sons of Korah
   formed a part, other psalms to be sung by them. What need, then, had he
   to borrow their help, or to have recourse to their assistance in a
   matter which he was much better able of himself to execute than they
   were? To me, therefore, it seems more probable, that the sons of Korah
   are here mentioned because this psalm was committed as a precious
   treasure to be preserved by them, as we know that out of the number of
   the singers, some were chosen and appointed to be keepers of the
   psalms. That there is no mention made of David's name does not of
   itself involve any difficulty, since we see the same omission in other
   psalms, of which there is, notwithstanding, the strongest grounds for
   concluding that he was the author. As to the word mskyl, maskil, I have
   already made some remarks upon it in the thirty-second psalm. This
   word, it is true, is sometimes found in the inscription of other psalms
   besides those in which David declares that he had been subjected to the
   chastening rod of God. It is, however, to be observed, that it is
   properly applied to chastisements, since the design of them is to
   instruct the children of God, when they do not sufficiently profit from
   doctrine. As to the particular time of the composition of this psalm,
   expositors are not altogether agreed. Some suppose that David here
   complains of his calamity, when he was expelled from the throne by his
   son Absalom. But I am rather disposed to entertain a different opinion,
   founded, if I mistake not, upon good reasons. The rebellion of Absalom
   was very soon suppressed, so that it did not long prevent David from
   approaching the sanctuary. And yet, the lamentation which he here makes
   refers expressly to a long state of exile, under which he had
   languished, and, as it were, pined away with grief. It is not the
   sorrow merely of a few days which he describes in the third verse; nay,
   the scope of the entire composition will clearly show that he had
   languished for a long time in the wretched condition of which he
   speaks. It has been alleged as an argument against referring this psalm
   to the reign of Saul, that the ark of the covenant was neglected during
   his reign, so that it is not very likely that David at that time
   conducted the stated choral services in the sanctuary; but this
   argument is not very conclusive: for although Saul only worshipped God
   as a mere matter of form, yet he was unwilling to be regarded in any
   other light than as a devout man. And as to David, he has shown in
   other parts of his writings with what diligence he frequented the holy
   assemblies, and more especially on festival days. Certainly, these
   words which we shall meet with in Psalm 55:14, "We walked unto the
   house of God in company," relate to the time of Saul.

   Psalm 42:1-3

   1. As the hart crieth [112] for the fountains of water, so my soul
   crieth after thee, O Jehovah! 2. My soul hath thirsted for God, even
   for the living God: when shall I come to appear before the face of God?
   3. My tears have been my bread day and night, while they say daily to
   me, Where is thy God?


   1. As the hart crieth for the fountains of water, etc The meaning of
   these two verses simply is, that David preferred to all the enjoyments,
   riches, pleasures, and honors of this world, the opportunity of access
   to the sanctuary, that in this way he might cherish and strengthen his
   faith and piety by the exercises prescribed in the Law. When he says
   that he cried for the living God, we are not to understand it merely in
   the sense of a burning love and desire towards God: but we ought to
   remember in what manner it is that, God allures us to himself, and by
   what means he raises our minds upwards. He does not enjoin us to ascend
   forthwith into heaven, but, consulting our weakness, he descends to us.
   David, then, considering that the way of access was shut against him,
   cried to God, because he was excluded from the outward service of the
   sanctuary, which is the sacred bond of intercourse with God. I do not
   mean to say that the observance of external ceremonies can of itself
   bring us into favor with God, but they are religious exercises which we
   cannot bear to want by reason of our infirmity. David, therefore, being
   excluded from the sanctuary, is no less grieved than if he had been
   separated from God himself. He did not, it is true, cease in the
   meantime to direct his prayers towards heaven, and even to the
   sanctuary itself; but conscious of his own infirmity, he was specially
   grieved that the way by which the faithful obtained access to God was
   shut against him. This is an example which may well suffice to put to
   shame the arrogance of those who without concern can bear to be
   deprived of those means, [113] or rather, who proudly despise them, as
   if it were in their power to ascend to heaven in a moment's flight;
   nay, as if they surpassed David in zeal and alacrity of mind. We must
   not, however, imagine that the prophet suffered himself to rest in
   earthly elements, [114] but only that he made use of them as a ladder,
   by which he might ascend to God, finding that he had not wings with
   which to fly thither. The similitude which he takes from a hart is
   designed to express the extreme ardor of his desire. The sense in which
   some explain this is, that the waters are eagerly sought by the harts,
   that they may recover from fatigue; but this, perhaps, is too limited.
   I admit that if the hunter pursue the stag, and the dogs also follow
   hard after it, when it comes to a river it gathers new strength by
   plunging into it. But we know also that at certain seasons of the year,
   harts, with an almost incredible desire, and more intensely than could
   proceed from mere thirst, seek after water; and although I would not
   contend for it, yet I think this is referred to by the prophet here.

   The second verse illustrates more clearly what I have already said,
   that David does not simply speak of the presence of God, but of the
   presence of God in connection with certain symbols; for he sets before
   himself the tabernacle, the altar, the sacrifices, and other ceremonies
   by which God had testified that he would be near his people; and that
   it behoved the faithful, in seeking to approach God, to begin by those
   things. Not that they should continue attached to them, but that they
   should, by the help of these signs and outward means, seek to behold
   the glory of God, which of itself is hidden from the sight.
   Accordingly, when we see the marks of the divine presence engraven on
   the word, or on external symbols, we can say with David that there is
   the face of God, provided we come with pure hearts to seek him in a
   spiritual manner. But when we imagine God to be present otherwise than
   he has revealed himself in his word, and the sacred institutions of his
   worship, or when we form any gross or earthly conception of his
   heavenly majesty, we are only inventing for ourselves visionary
   representations, which disfigure the glory of God, and turn his truth
   into a lie.

   3. My tears have been my bread Here the Psalmist mentions another sharp
   piercing shaft with which the wicked and malevolent grievously wounded
   his heart. There can be no doubt that Satan made use of such means as
   these to fan the flame that consumed him with grief. "What," we may
   suppose that adversary to say, "wouldst thou have? Seest thou not that
   God hath cast thee off? For certainly he desires to be worshipped in
   the tabernacle, to which you have now no opportunity of access, and
   from which you are as it were banished." These were violent assaults,
   and enough to have overturned the faith of this holy man, unless,
   supported by the power of the Spirit in a more than ordinary degree, he
   had made a strong and vigorous resistance. It is evident that his
   feelings had been really and strongly affected. We may be often
   agitated, and yet not to such an extent as to abstain from eating and
   drinking; but when a man voluntarily abstains from food, and indulges
   so much in weeping, that he daily neglects his ordinary meals, and is
   continually overwhelmed in sorrow, it is obvious that he is troubled in
   no light degree; but that he is wounded severely, and even to the
   heart. [115] Now, David says, that he did not experience greater relief
   in any thing whatever than from weeping; and, therefore, he gave
   himself up to it, just in the same manner as men take pleasure and
   enjoyment in eating; and this he says had been the case every day, and
   not only for a short time. Let us, therefore, whenever the ungodly
   triumph over us in our miseries, and spitefully taunt us that God is
   against us, never forget that it is Satan who moves them to speak in
   this manner, in order to overthrow our faith; and that, therefore, it
   is not time for us to take our ease, or to yield to indifference, when
   a war so dangerous is waged against us. There is still another reason
   which ought to inspire us with such feelings, and it is this, that the
   name of God is held up to scorn by the ungodly; for they cannot scoff
   at our faith without greatly reproaching him. If, then, we are not
   altogether insensible, we must in such circumstances be affected with
   the deepest sorrow.

   [112] Horsley also reads, "crieth." In the Hebrew it is "brayeth." In
   Hebrew there are distinct words to mark the peculiar cries of the hart,
   the bear, the lion, the zebra, the wolf, the horse, the dog, the cow,
   and the sheep. The distressing cry of the hart seems to be here
   expressed. Being naturally of a hot and sanguine constitution, it
   suffers much from thirst in the Oriental regions. When in want of
   water, and unable to find it, it makes a mournful noise, and eagerly
   seeks the cooling river; and especially when pursued over the dry and
   parched wilderness by the hunter, it seeks the stream of water with
   intense desire, and braying plunges into it with eagerness, as soon as
   it has reached its wished-for banks, at once to quench its thirst and
   escape its deadly pursuers. It is the female hart which is here meant,
   as "brayeth" is feminine, and as the reading of the LXX. also shows,
   which is, he elsphos

   Psalm 42:4-6

   4. When I remember these things, [116] I pour out my soul within me,
   because I had gone in company with them, [literally in number,] leading
   them even to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, even
   the multitude dancing for joy. [117] 5. O my soul! why art thou cast
   down? and why art thou disquieted within me? Wait thou upon God: for I
   shall yet praise him for the helps [or salvations] of his countenance.
   6. O my God! my soul is cast down within me, when I remember thee from
   the land of Jordan and of Hermonim, [or, and from the Hermons,] from
   the hill Mizar.


   4. When I remember these things This verse is somewhat obscure, on
   account of the variation of the tenses in the Hebrew. And yet I have no
   doubt that the true and natural sense is, that David, when he called to
   remembrance his former condition, experienced so much the greater
   sadness by comparing it with his present condition. The remembrance, I
   say, of the past had no small influence in aggravating his misery, from
   the thought that he, who had formerly acted the part of a leader and
   standard-bearer in conducting others to the holy assemblies, should now
   be debarred from access to the temple. We know that those who have been
   accustomed to suffering from their childhood become insensible to it,
   and the very continuance of misery produces in us a certain degree of
   callousness, so that we cease to think of it, or to regard it as
   anything unusual. It is different with those who have not been so
   accustomed to it. And, therefore, it is no wonder if David, who had
   been not one of the common people, but who had lately occupied a chief
   place among the princes, and had been leader of the foremost ranks
   among the faithful, should be more grievously disquieted, when he saw
   himself utterly cast off, and not admitted to a place even among the
   lowest. Accordingly, I connect the demonstrative pronoun these with the
   declaration which follows, namely, that he remembered how he had been
   accustomed to mingle in the company of the godly, and to lead them to
   the house of God. To pour out the soul is taken metaphorically by some
   for to give utterance to his grief; others are of opinion, that it
   signifies to rejoice greatly, or, as we commonly speak, to be melted or
   dissolved in joy It appears to me that David rather means to say, that
   his affections were, as it were, melted within him, whether it were
   from joy or sorrow. As the soul of man sustains him, so long as it
   keeps its energies collected, so also it sinks within him, and, as it
   were, vanishes away, when any of the affections, by excessive
   indulgence, gains the ascendancy. [118] Accordingly, he is said to pour
   out his soul, who is so excited, that his affections lose their vigor,
   and begin to flow out. David's language implies, that his soul melted
   and fainted within him by the greatness of his sorrow, when he thought
   of the condition from which he had fallen. If any would rather
   understand it of joy, the language will admit of such an illustration
   as this: Formerly I took such a delight in walking foremost in the
   ranks of the people, and leading them in procession to the sanctuary,
   that my heart melted within me for joy, and I was quite transported
   with it: if, therefore, I should again be restored to the same happy
   condition, all my feelings would be ravished with the same delight. I
   have, however, already stated what appeared to me to be the best
   exposition. We must not suppose that David had been overwhelmed with
   the sorrow of the world; but, as in his present misery he discerned the
   wrath of God, he sorrowed after a godly sort, because, by his own
   fault, he had provoked the displeasure of God against him. And, even
   without touching this reason of his sorrow, we see the source from
   which it proceeded. Even when afflicted by so many personal privations,
   he is nevertheless grieved only for the sanctuary, thereby showing that
   it would have been less distressing to him to have been deprived of
   life, than to continue in a state of exile from the presence of God.
   And, indeed, the way in which we ought to regulate all our affections
   is this, That, on the one hand, our joy may have respect to the
   paternal love and favor of God towards us, and that, on the other, the
   only cause of our grief may arise from feeling that he is angry with
   us. This is the "godly sorrow" of which Paul speaks, 2 Corinthians
   7:10. By the term number, which in the Hebrew is called sk, sach,
   David, I have no doubt, intended ranks, or companies in procession; for
   when they went to the tabernacle on the holy days, they went not in
   confusion or in crowds, but walked in regular order, (Luke 2:44.)

   5 O my soul! why art thou cast down? From this it appears that David
   contended strongly against his sorrow, lest he should yield to
   temptation: but what we ought chiefly to observe is, that he had
   experienced a strong and bitter contest before he obtained the victory
   over it; or we might rather say, that he was not delivered from it
   after one alarming assault, but was often called upon to enter into new
   scenes of conflict. It need not excite our wonder that he was so much
   disquieted and cast down, since he could not discern any sign of the
   divine favor towards him. But David here represents himself as if he
   formed two opposing parties. In so far as in the exercise of faith he
   relied upon the promises of God, being armed with the Spirit of
   invincible fortitude, he set himself, in opposition to the affections
   of his flesh, to restrain and subdue them; and, at the same time, he
   rebuked his own cowardice and imbecility of heart. Moreover, although
   he carried on war against the devil and the world, yet he does not
   enter into open and direct conflict with them, but rather regards
   himself as the enemy against whom he desires chiefly to contend. And
   doubtless the best way to overcome Satan is, not to go out of
   ourselves, but to maintain an internal conflict against he desires of
   our own hearts. It ought, however, to be observed, that David confesses
   that his soul was cast down within him: for when our infirmities rise
   up in vast array, and, like the waves of the sea, are ready to
   overwhelm us, our faith seems to us to fail, and, in consequence we are
   so overcome by mere fear, that we lack courage, and are afraid to enter
   into the conflict. Whenever, therefore, such a state of indifference
   and faint-heartedness shall seize upon us, let us remember, that to
   govern and subdue the desires of their hearts, and especially to
   contend against the feelings of distrust which are natural to all, is a
   conflict to which the godly are not unfrequently called. But here there
   are two evils specified, which, however apparently different, yet
   assail our hearts at the same time; the one is discouragement, and the
   other disquietude When we are quite downcast, we are not free of a
   feeling of disquietude, which leads us to murmur and complain. The
   remedy to both of them is here added, hope in God, which alone inspires
   our minds, in the first place, with confidence in the midst of the
   greatest troubles; and, secondly, by the exercise of patience,
   preserves them in peace. In what follows, David very well expresses the
   power and nature of hope by these words, I shall yet praise him; for it
   has the effect of elevating our thoughts to the contemplation of the
   grace of God, when it is hidden from our view. By the term yet, he
   confesses that for the present, and in so far as the praises of God are
   concerned, his mouth is stopped, seeing he is oppressed and shut up on
   all sides. This, however, does not prevent him from extending his hope
   to some future distant period; and, in order to escape from his present
   sorrow, and, as it were, get beyond its reach, he promises himself what
   as yet there was no appearance of obtaining. Nor is this an imaginary
   expectation produced by a fanciful mind; but, relying upon the promises
   of God, he not only encourages himself to cherish good hope, but also
   promises himself certain deliverance. We can only be competent
   witnesses to our brethren of the grace of God when, in the first place,
   we have borne testimony to it to our own hearts. What follows, The
   helps of his countenance, may be differently expounded. Commentators,
   for the most art, supply the word for: so that, according to this view,
   David here expresses the matter or cause of thanksgiving -- that yet he
   would give praise or thanks to God for the help of his countenance This
   interpretation I readily admit. At the same time, the sense will not be
   inappropriate if we read the terms separately, thus: helps or
   salvations are from the countenance of God; for as soon as he is
   pleased to look upon his people he sets them in safety. The countenance
   of God is taken for the manifestation of his favor. His countenance
   then appears serene and gracious to us; as, on the contrary, adversity,
   like the intervening clouds, darkens or obscures its benign aspect.

   6. O my God! my soul is cast down within me. If we suppose that this
   verse requires no supplement, then it will consist of two distinct and
   separate sentences. Literally it may be read thus: O my God! my soul is
   cast down within me, therefore will I remember thee, etc. But the
   greater number of expositors render the word l-kn, al-ken, by forasmuch
   as, or because, so that it is employed to express the reason of what is
   contained in the preceding clause. And certainly it would be very
   appropriate in this sense, That as often as David, from the land of
   Jordan, in which he now lay hid as an exile, set himself to think of
   the sanctuary, his sorrow was so much the more increased. If, however,
   any would rather, as I have already observed, distinguish this verse
   into two parts, it must be understood as meaning that David thought of
   God in his exile, not to nourish his grief, but to assuage it. He did
   not act the part of those who find no relief in their afflictions but
   in forgetting God; for although wounded by his hand, he, nevertheless,
   failed not to acknowledge him to be his physician. Accordingly, the
   import of the whole verse will be this, I am now living in a state of
   exile, banished from the temple, and seem to be an alien from the
   household of God; but this will not prevent me from regarding him, and
   having recourse to him. I am now deprived of the accustomed sacrifices,
   of which I stand much in need, but he has not taken from me his word.
   As, however, the first interpretation is the one more generally
   received, and this also seems to be added by way of exposition, it is
   better not to depart from it. David then complains that his soul was
   oppressed with sorrow, because he saw himself cast out of the Church of
   God. At the same time, there is in these words a tacit contrast; [119]
   as if he had said, It is not the desire to be restored to my wife, or
   my house, or any of my possessions, which grieves me so much as the
   distressing consideration, that I now find myself prevented from taking
   part in the service of God. We ought to learn from this, that although
   we are deprived of the helps which God has appointed for the
   edification of our faith and piety, it is, nevertheless, our duty to be
   diligent in stirring up our minds, that we may never suffer ourselves
   to be forgetful of God. But, above all, this is to be observed, that as
   in the preceding verse we have seen David contending courageously
   against his own affections, so now we here see by what means he
   steadfastly maintained his ground. He did this by having recourse to
   the help of God, and taking refuge in it as in a holy sanctuary. And,
   assuredly, if meditation upon the promises of God do not lead us to
   prayer, it will not have sufficient power to sustain and confirm us.
   Unless God impart strength to us, how shall we be able to subdue the
   many evil thoughts which constantly arise in our minds? The soul of man
   serves the purpose, as it were, of a workshop to Satan in which to
   forge a thousand methods of despair. And, therefore, it is not without
   reason that David, after a severe conflict with himself, has recourse
   to prayer, and calls upon God as the witness of his sorrow. By the land
   of Jordan is to be understood that part of the country which, in
   respect of Judea, was beyond the river of that name. This appears still
   more clearly from the word Hermonim or Hermons. Hermon was a
   mountainous district, which extended to a considerable distance; and
   because it had several tops, was called in the plural number Hermonim.
   [120]

   Perhaps David also has purposely made use of the plural number on
   account of the fear by which he was forced frequently to change his
   place of abode, and wander hither and thither. As to the word Mizar,
   some suppose that it was not the proper name of a mountain, and
   therefore translate it little, supposing that there is here an indirect
   comparison of the Hermons with the mountain of Sion, as if David meant
   to say that Sion, which was comparatively a small hill, was greater in
   his estimation than the lofty Hermons; but it appears to me that this
   would be a constrained interpretation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [116] "Things" is a supplement. Boothroyd prefers reading "these
   times."

   [117] In this verse, there is evidently a reference to the festive
   religious solemnities of the Jews, in which singing and dancing were
   used. These also formed an eminent part of the religious rites of the
   ancient Greeks and other heathen nations. Among the Greeks at the
   present day, it is the practice for a lady of distinction to lead the
   dance, and to be followed by a troop of young females, who imitate her
   steps, and if she sings, make up the chorus. This serves to throw light
   on the description given of Miriam, when she "took a timbrel in her
   hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and dances,"
   (Exodus 15:20.) She led the dance; they followed and imitated her
   steps. When David "danced before the Lord" at the bringing up of the
   ark, "with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet," it is probable
   that he was accompanied by others whom he led in the dance, (2 Samuel
   6:15, 16.) To this practice there is evidently an allusion in this
   passage; and the allusion greatly enhances its beauty.

   [118] "Car ainsi que l'ame de l'homme le soustient tandis qu'elle
   conserve sa vigueur et la tient comme amasse, aussi elle se fond, et
   par maniere de dire, s'esvanouit quand quelque affection desmesuree
   vient a y dominer." -- Fr.

   [119] "C'est a dire, consideration d'autres choses a l'opposite." --
   Fr. marg. "That is to say, the consideration of other things quite
   opposite."

   [120] Just as we say the Alps and the Appenines. The Hermons formed
   part of the ridge of the high hills called Antilibanus. The sources of
   the Jordan are in the vicinity. Davidson reads, "From the land of
   Jordan, even of the Hermons; the two espressions signifying the same
   district." -- Sacred Hermeneutics, p. 667.

   Psalm 42:7-8

   7. Depth calleth unto depth [121] at the noise of thy waterspouts:
   [122] all thy waves and thy floods have passed over me. 8. Jehovah will
   command his loving-kindness by day: and by night his song shall be with
   me; and prayer to the God of my life.


   7. Depth calleth unto depth These words express the grievousness, as
   well as the number and long continuance, of the miseries which he
   suffered; as if he had said, I am oppressed not only with one kind of
   misery, but various kinds of distress return one after another, so that
   there seems to be neither end nor measure to them. In the first place,
   by the term depth, he shows that the temptations by which he was
   assailed were such, that they might well be compared to gulfs in the
   sea; then he complains of their long continuance, which he describes by
   the very appropriate figure, that his temptations cry out from a
   distance, and call to one another. In the second part of the verse, he
   continues the same metaphor, when he says, that all the waves and
   floods of God have passed over his head By this he means that he had
   been overwhelmed, and as it were swallowed up by the accumulation of
   afflictions. It ought, however, to be observed, that he designates the
   cruelty of Saul, and his other enemies, floods of God, that in all our
   adversities we may always remember to humble ourselves under the mighty
   hand of God which afflicts us. But it is of importance to go beyond
   this, and to consider, that if it should please God to rain with
   violence upon us, as soon as he shall have opened his sluices or
   waterspouts, there will be no termination to our miseries till he is
   appeased; for he has in his power means marvellous and unknown for
   executing his vengeance against us. Thus, when once his anger is
   kindled against us, there will be not only one depth to swallow us up,
   but depth will call unto depth. And as the insensibility of men is
   such, that they do not stand in awe of the threatenings of God, to the
   degree in which they ought, whenever mention is made of his vengeance,
   let us recall this verse to our recollection.

   8. Jehovah will command his loving-kindness by day The verb here used
   is of the future tense; but I do not deny that, according to the Hebrew
   idiom, it might be rendered in the past tense, as some do who think
   that David here enumerates the benefits which he had formerly received
   from God, in order by contrast to add greater force to the complaint
   which he makes of his present sad and miserable condition; as if he had
   said, How comes it to pass that God, who formerly manifested so much
   kindness towards me, having as it were changed his mind, now deals
   towards me with great severity? But as there is no sufficient reason
   for changing the tense of the verb, and as the other interpretation
   seems more in accordance with the scope of the text, let us adhere to
   it. I do not, indeed, positively deny, that for the strengthening of
   his faith, David calls to memory the benefits which he had already
   experienced from God; but I think that he here promises himself
   deliverance in future, though it be as yet hidden from him. I have,
   therefore, no desire to raise any discussion regarding the verb,
   whether it should be taken in the future or in the past tense, provided
   only it be fully admitted that the argument of David is to this effect:
   Why should I not expect that God will be merciful to me, so that in the
   day-time his loving-kindness may be manifested towards me, and by night
   upon my bed a song of joy be with me? He, no doubt, places this ground
   of comfort in opposition to the sorrow which he might well apprehend
   from the dreadful tokens of the divine displeasure, which he has
   enumerated in the preceding verse. The prayer of which he speaks in the
   end of the verse is not to be understood as the prayer of an afflicted
   or sorrowful man; but it comprehends an expression of the delight which
   is experienced when God, by manifesting his favor to us, gives us free
   access into his presence. And, therefore, he also calls him the God of
   his life, because from the knowledge of this arises cheerfulness of
   heart.

   quantities of water; which it frequently pours down in torrents on the
   earth or the sea. So great is the quantity of water, and so sudden and
   precipitate the fall, that if it happen to break on a vessel, it
   shatters it to pieces, and sinks it in an instant. Those waterspouts
   which Dr Shaw saw in the Mediterranean, he informs us, "seemed to be so
   many cylinders of water falling down from the clouds;" and he states,
   that they "are more frequent near the capes of Latikea, Greego, and
   Carmel, than in any other part of the Mediterranean." -- (Travels, p.

   rendered famous by the prayers of the prophet Elijah. The Jews then
   could not be ignorant of what happened on their coasts; and David must
   have known of these dangers of the sea, if he had not actually seen
   some of them." -- (Observations, volume 3, p. 222.) In the description
   of a violent and dangerous storm at sea, by which he here portrays his
   great distress, he would, therefore, naturally draw his imagery from
   these awful phenomena, which were of frequent occurrence on the Jewish
   coasts.

   Psalm 42:9-11

   9. I will say to God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? Why go I
   mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? 10. It is as a wound
   [123] in my bones when my enemies reproach me, saying to me daily,
   Where is thy God? 11. O my soul! why art thou cast down? and why art
   thou disquieted within me? Hope in God; for I shall yet praise him, the
   helps [or salvations] of my countenance, and my God.


   9. I will say to God my rock If we read the preceding verse in the past
   tense, the meaning of this verse will be, Since God has, in this way,
   heretofore shown himself so kind towards me, I will pray to him now
   with so much the greater confidence: for the experience which I have
   had of his goodness will inspire me with courage. But if the preceding
   verse is rendered in the future tense, David, in this verse, combines
   the prayer which it contains with the reflections which faith led him
   to make. And, surely, whoever, from a persuasion of the paternal love
   of God, anticipates for himself the same favor which David has just
   described, will also be induced from his example to pray for it with
   greater confidence. The meaning, then, will be this: Since I expect
   that God will be favorable to me, inasmuch as by day he manifests his
   favor towards me, and continues to do this, so that even by night I
   have occasion to praise him, I will bewail the more frankly my miseries
   before him, saying, O Lord! my rock, why hast thou forgotten me? In
   making such a complaint, the faithful are not to be understood as
   meaning that God has utterly rejected them: for if they did not believe
   that they were under his care and protection, it were in vain for them
   to call upon him. But they speak in this manner according to the sense
   of the flesh. This forgetfulness, then, relates both to outward
   appearance, and to the disquietude by which the faithful are troubled
   according to the flesh, although, in the meantime, they rest assured by
   faith that God regards them, and will not be deaf to their request.

   10 It is as a slaughter in my bones. This verse is somewhat involved in
   point of expression; but as to the meaning of it there is no obscurity.
   David here affirms that the grief which he experienced from the
   reproaches of his enemies, wounded him in no degree less than if they
   had pierced through his bones. The word vrtsh, beretsach, signifies
   killing; and, therefore, I have retained this idea in the translation
   of it. And yet I do not condemn the opinion of those who render it a
   slaughtering sword. [124] There is here a difference as to the reading,
   arising from the great similarity which there is between the two
   letters v, beth, and k, caph, the mark of similitude. As the letter v
   beth, is often superfluous, I would rather be disposed, in a doubtful
   matter like this, to omit it altogether. But as I have said, the sense
   is perfectly plain, except that interpreters do not seem to take this
   sufficiently into their consideration, that by the terms my bones, the
   bitterness of grief is referred to; for we feel much more acutely any
   injury which is done to the bones, than if a sword should pierce the
   bowels, or the other parts of the body which are soft and yielding. Nor
   should the children of God regard this similitude as hyperbolical; and
   if one should wonder why David took so sorely to heart the derision of
   his enemies, he only manifests in this his own insensibility. For of
   all the bitter evils which befall us, there is nothing which can
   inflict upon us a severer wound than to see the wicked tear in pieces
   the majesty of God, and endeavor to destroy and overturn our faith. The
   doctrine taught by Paul, (Galatians 4:24,) concerning the persecution
   of Ishmael, is well known. Many consider his childish jesting as of
   little moment, but as it tended to this effect, that the covenant of
   God should be esteemed as a thing of no value, it is on that account,
   according to the judgment of the Holy Spirit, to be accounted a most
   cruel persecution. David, therefore, with much propriety, compares to a
   slaughtering sword, which penetrates even within the bones and marrow,
   the derision of his enemies, by which he saw his own faith and the word
   of God trampled under foot. And would to God that all who boast
   themselves of being his children would learn to bear their private
   wrongs more patiently, and to manifest the same vehement zeal for which
   David is here distinguished, when their faith is assailed to the
   dishonor of God, and when the word also which gives them life is
   included in the same reproach!

   11 O my soul! why art thou cast down? This repetition shows us that
   David had not so completely overcome his temptations in one encounter,
   or by one extraordinary effort, as to render it unnecessary for him to
   enter anew into the same conflict. By this example, therefore, we are
   admonished, that although Satan, by his assaults, often subjects us to
   a renewal of the same trouble, we ought not to lose our courage, or
   allow ourselves to be cast down. The latter part of this verse differs
   from the fifth verse in one word, while in every other respect they
   agree. In the fifth verse, it is the helps of His countenance, but here
   we have the relative pronoun of the first person, thus, The helps of My
   countenance Perhaps in this place, the letter w, vau, which in the
   Hebrew language denotes the third person, is wanting. Still, as all the
   other versions agree in the reading which I have adopted, [125] David
   might, without any absurdity, call God by this designation, The helps
   or salvations of My countenance, inasmuch as he looked with confidence
   for a deliverance, manifest and certain, as if God should appear in a
   visible manner as his defender, and the protector of his welfare. There
   can, however, be no doubt, that in this place the term helps or
   salvations is to be viewed as an epithet applied to God; for
   immediately after it follows, and my God

   [123] "Ou, tuerie." -- Fr. marg. "Or, slaughter."

   [124] The original word rtsch retsach, is constantly used in prose for
   a homicide, or murderer, being derived from the verb rtsch ratsach,
   which signifies to slay, to murder; and although it is not used in any
   other passage for a sword, "it may," as Horsley observes, "very
   naturally, in poetry, be applied to the instrument of slaughter, the
   sword." In support of this view, he refers to a passage in one of the
   tragedies of Sophocles, in which Ajax calls his sword, upon which he is
   about to fall, O sphageus which gives the literal rendering of the
   Hebrew rtsch, retsach, murderer Horsley's rendering is, "While the
   sword is in my bones."

   [125] All the ancient versions, with the exception of the Chaldee, read
   both in this and the fifth verse, "my countenance." Hammond thinks that
   as these words are the burden of this and the following psalm, and as
   the meaning of the other words of the sentence in which they occur is
   the same in the different verses, it is not improbable that the old
   reading in both places may have been "my countenance."

   PSALM 43

   This psalm is very similar to the preceding. [126] David, who probably
   was the author of it, being chased and driven out of his country by the
   unjust violence and tyranny of his enemies, calls upon God for
   vengeance, and encourages himself to hope for restoration.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 43:1-5

   1. Judge me, O God! and plead my cause: deliver me from the cruel [or
   unmerciful] nation, free me from the deceitful and wicked man. 2. For
   thou art the God of my strength; why art thou estranged from me? why go
   I sad because of the oppression of the enemy? 3. Send forth thy light
   and thy truth, let them direct me, let them conduct me to thy holy
   hill, and to thy tabernacles. 4. And I will go to the altar of God, to
   God my exceeding joy, [literally the joy of my rejoicing:] and I will
   praise thee upon the harp, O God! my God. 5. O my soul! why art thou
   cast down? and why art thou disquieted within me? for I will yet praise
   him who is the help of my countenance, and my God.


   1 Judge me, O God! David, in the first place, complains of the extreme
   cruelty of his enemies; but in the verses which immediately follow, he
   shows that there was nothing which he felt to be more grievous, than to
   be deprived of the opportunity of access to the sanctuary. We have an
   evidence of his enjoying the testimony of a good conscience in this,
   that he commends the defense of his cause to God. The term judge, which
   he first makes use of, is nothing else than to undertake the defense of
   one's cause; and he expresses his meaning more clearly by adding, plead
   my cause The substance and object of his prayer, indeed, were, that he
   might be delivered from the wicked and malicious men by whom he was
   undeservedly persecuted. But as it is to the miserable and guiltless,
   who are wrongfully afflicted, that God promises his help, David, in the
   first place, submits himself to be examined by him, that, having
   discovered and thoroughly proved the rectitude of his cause, he may at
   length grant him aid. And as it is a most cheering source of
   consolation for us to find that God disdains not to take cognisance of
   our cause, so also, it is vain for us to expect that he will avenge the
   injuries and wrongs which are done to us, unless our own integrity be
   so manifest as to induce him to be favorable to us against our
   adversaries. By the unmerciful nation is to be understood the whole
   company of David's enemies, who were cruel, and destitute of all the
   feelings of humanity. What follows, concerning the deceitful and wicked
   man, might indeed be applied to Saul; but it seems rather to be a form
   of speech in which, by enallage, the singular number is used for the
   plural.

   2 For thou art the God of my strength This verse differs very little
   from the ninth verse of the preceding psalm, and the difference
   consists more in words than in matter. Setting as a shield against
   temptation the fact, that he had experienced the power of God to be
   present with him, he complains that his life is spent in mourning,
   because he sees himself as it were abandoned to the will of his
   enemies. He considered it absolutely certain that his enemies had no
   power to do him harm except in so far as the Lord permitted them; and
   therefore he asks, as if it were something altogether unaccountable,
   how it happened that his enemies prevailed against him whilst he was
   under the assured protection and guardianship of God. From this he
   gathers courage to pray, that God would be pleased again to manifest
   his favor, which he seemed to have hid from him for a time. The term
   light is to be understood as denoting favor; for as adversities not
   only obscure the face of God, but also overcast the heavens, as it
   were, with clouds and fogs, so also, when we enjoy the divine blessing
   which makes rich, it is like the cheerful light of a serene day shining
   around us; or rather the light of life, dispelling all that thick
   obscurity which overwhelmed us in sorrow. By this word the Psalmist
   intimates two things; first, that all our miseries arise from no other
   source than this, that God withdraws from us the tokens of his paternal
   love; and, secondly, that as soon as he is pleased to manifest towards
   us his serene and gracious countenance, deliverance and salvation also
   arise to us. He adds truth, because he expected this light only from
   the promises of God. The unbelieving desire the favor of God, but they
   do not raise their eyes to his light; for the natural disposition of
   man always tends towards the earth, unless his mind and all his
   feelings are raised up on high by the word of God. In order, then, to
   encourage himself in the hope of obtaining the grace of God, David
   rests with confidence in this, that God, who is true, and cannot
   deceive any, has promised to assist his servants. We must therefore
   explain the sentence thus: Send forth thy light, that it may be a token
   and testimony of thy truth, or that it may really and effectually prove
   that thou art faithful and free from all deceit in thy promises. The
   knowledge of the divine favor, it is true, must be sought for in the
   Word of God; nor has faith any other foundation on which it can rest
   with security except his word; but when God stretches out his hand to
   help us, the experience of this is no small confirmation both of the
   word and of faith. David declares what was the chief object of his
   desire, and what end he had in view in seeking deliverance from his
   calamities, when he says, Let them direct me, and lead me to thy holy
   hill. As the chief cause of his sorrow consisted in his being banished
   from the congregation of the godly, so he places the height of all his
   enjoyments in this, that he might be at liberty to take part in the
   exercises of religion, and to worship God in the sanctuary. Tacitly,
   indeed, David makes a vow of thanksgiving to God; but there can be no
   doubt, that by these words he intimates, that the end which he had in
   view in seeking deliverance from his afflictions was, that as formerly
   he might be at liberty to return to the sanctuary, from which he was
   driven by the tyranny of his enemies. And it deserves to be
   particularly noticed, that although he had been deprived of his wife,
   spoiled of his goods, his house, and all his other earthly comforts,
   yet he always felt such an ardent desire to come to the temple, that he
   forgot almost every thing else. But it is enough for me at present
   briefly to notice this, as in the preceding psalm I have treated at
   greater length of this holy desire of David, which ought to be imitated
   by all the faithful. [127] Still, however, it might be asked, How it is
   that mention is here made of Mount Sion, which was not appointed to the
   service of God till after the death of Saul? The only solution of this
   difficulty which I can give is, that David, composing this psalm at an
   after period of his life, employs, in accordance with the revelation
   which had subsequently been given to him, language which otherwise he
   would have used more generally in speaking only of the tabernacle, and
   without at all specifying the place. [128] In this I see no
   inconsistency.

   4. And I will go to the altar of God. Here he promises to God a solemn
   sacrifice, in commemoration of the deliverance which he should obtain
   from him; for he speaks not only of the daily or ordinary service, but
   in making mention of the altar on which it was customary to offer the
   peace-offerings, he expresses the token of gratitude and thanksgiving
   of which I have spoken. For this reason, also, he calls God the God of
   his joy, because, being delivered from sorrow, and restored to a state
   of joy, he resolves to acknowledge openly so great a benefit. And he
   calls him the joy of his rejoicing, that he may the more illustriously
   set forth the grace of his deliverance. The second word in the genitive
   is added by way of an epithet, and by it he signifies that his heart
   had been filled with joy of no common kind, when God restored him,
   contrary to the expectation of all. As to the fifth verse, I have
   already treated of it sufficiently in the preceding psalm, and
   therefore deem it superfluous to speak of it here.

   [126] This and the preceding psalm have been considered by the greater
   number of critics as having originally formed only one psalm, and they
   make but one in forty-six MSS. The similarity of the style, sentiment,
   and metrical structure, and the occurrence of the intercalary verse at
   verses 5th and 10th of Psalm 42, and verse 5th of Psalm 43, confirm
   this opinion. "The fact, indeed," says Williams, "is self evident, and
   easily accounted for. The Jewish choristers having, on some occasion,
   found the anthem too long, have divided it for their own conveniency,
   (no uncommon thing among choristers,) and, being once divided, it was
   ignorantly supposed it ought to be so divided."

   PSALM 44

   This psalm is divided into three principal parts. In the beginning of
   it the faithful record the infinite mercy of God towards his people,
   and the many tokens by which he had testified his fatherly love towards
   them. Then they complain that they do not now find that God is
   favorable towards them, as he had formerly been towards their fathers.
   In the third place, they refer to the covenant which God had made with
   Abraham, and declare that they have kept it with all faithfulness,
   notwithstanding the sore afflictions to which they had been subjected.
   At the same time, they complain that they are cruelly persecuted for no
   other cause but for having continued steadfastly in the pure worship of
   God. In the end, a prayer is added, that God would not forget the
   wrongful oppression of his servants, which especially tends to bring
   dishonor and reproach upon religion.

   To the chief musician of the sons of Korah, giving instruction.

   It is uncertain who was the author of this psalm; but it is clearly
   manifest that it was composed rather by any other person than by David.
   The complaints and lamentations which it contains may be appropriately
   referred to that miserable and calamitous period in which the
   outrageous tyranny of Antiochus destroyed and wasted every thing. [129]
   Some, indeed, may be disposed to apply it more generally; for after the
   return of the Jews from the captivity of Babylon, they were scarcely
   ever free from severe afflictions. Such a view, doubtless, would not be
   applicable to the time of David, under whose reign the Church enjoyed
   prosperity, It may be, too, that during the time of their captivity in
   Babylon, some one of the prophets composed this complaint in name of
   all the people. It is, however, at the same time to be observed, that
   the state of the Church, such as it was to be after the appearance of
   Christ, is here described. Paul, in Romans 8:36, as we shall afterwards
   see in its proper place, did not understand this psalm as a description
   of the state of the Church in one age only, but he warns us, that
   Christians are appointed to the same afflictions, and should not expect
   that their condition on earth, even to the end of the world, will be
   different from what God has made known to us, as it were by way of
   example, in the case of the Jews after their return from captivity.
   Christ, it is true, afterwards appeared as the Redeemer of the Church.
   He did not however appear, that the flesh should luxuriate in ease upon
   the earth, but rather that we should wage war under the banner of the
   cross, until we are received into the rest of the heavenly kingdom. As
   to the meaning of the word mskyl, maskil, it has been already elsewhere
   explained. It is sometimes found in the inscription of psalms whose
   subject is cheerful; but it is more commonly used when the subject
   treated of is distressing; for it is a singular means of leading us to
   profit by the instruction of the Lord, when, by subduing the obduracy
   of our hearts, he brings us under his yoke.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 44:1-3

   1. O God! we have heard with our ears, our fathers have declared to us,
   the work which thou hast done in their days, even in the days of old.
   2. Thou hast expelled the heathen [or nations [130] ] with thy hand,
   and planted them [131] thou hast wasted the peoples [132] and
   multiplied them, [or made them [133] to spread.] 3. For they got not
   possession of the land by their own sword, and their own arm did not
   save them, but thy right hand, and thy arm, and the light of thy
   countenance, because thou hadst a favor for them.


   1. O God! we have heard with our ears. The people of God here recount
   the goodness which he had formerly manifested towards their fathers,
   that, by showing the great dissimilarity of their own condition, they
   may induce God to alleviate their miseries. They begin by declaring
   that they speak not of things unknown or doubtful, but that they
   related events, the truth of which was authenticated by unexceptionable
   witnesses. The expression, We have heard with our ears, is not to be
   considered as a redundant form of speech, but one of great weight. It
   is designed to point out that the grace of God towards their fathers
   was so renowned, that no doubt could be entertained respecting it. They
   add, that their knowledge of these things was handed down from age to
   age by those who witnessed them. It is not meant that their fathers,
   who had been brought up out of Egypt, had, a thousand and five hundred
   years after, declared to their posterity the benefits God had conferred
   upon them. The import of the language is, that not only the first
   deliverance, but that also the various other works which God had
   wrought from time to time in behalf of his people, had come down, as it
   were, from hand to hand, in an uninterrupted series, even to the latest
   age. As, therefore, those who, after the lapse of many ages, became
   witnesses and heralds of the grace which God had exercised towards this
   people, spake upon the report of the first generation, the faithful are
   warranted in saying, as they here do, that their fathers have declared
   to them that which they certainly knew, because the knowledge of it had
   not been lost by reason of its antiquity, but was continually preserved
   by the remembrance of it from the fathers to the children. The sum of
   the whole is, that God had manifested his goodness towards the children
   of Abraham, not only for ten or twenty years, but that ever since he
   had received them into his favor, he had never ceased to bestow upon
   them continued tokens of his grace.

   2. Thou hast expelled the heathen with thy hand. This is an
   illustration of the preceding verse: for the inspired writer had not
   yet expressly referred to that work of God, the fame of which had been
   preserved by their fathers. He therefore now adds, that God with his
   own hand expelled the heathen, in order to plant in their room the
   children of Abraham: and that he wasted and destroyed them, that he
   might increase and multiply the seed of Abraham. He compares the
   ancient inhabitants of the land of Canaan to trees; for, from long
   continued possession of the country, they had, as it were, taken root
   in it. The sudden change, therefore, which had happened to them, was as
   if a man plucked up trees by the roots to plant others in their stead.
   But as it would not have been enough for God's ancient people to have
   been planted at first in the country, another metaphor is here added,
   by which the faithful testify that the blessing of God had caused this
   chosen people to increase and multiply, even as a tree, extending it
   roots and its branches far and wide, gains still greater strength in
   the place where it has been planted. Besides, it is necessary to
   observe for what purpose it is that the faithful here magnify this
   manifestation of the grace of God. It often happens that our own hearts
   suggest to us grounds of despair, when we begin to conclude that God
   has rejected us, because he does not continue to bestow upon us the
   same benefits which in his goodness he vouchsafed to our fathers. But
   it were altogether inconsistent, that the faithful here disposing their
   hearts for prayer, should allow such an obstacle to prevent them from
   exercising the confidence which is proper in prayer. I freely admit,
   that the more we think of the benefits which God has bestowed upon
   others, the greater is the grief which we experience when he does not
   relieve us in our adversities. But faith directs us to another
   conclusion, namely, that we should assuredly believe that we shall also
   in due time experience some relief, since God continues unchangeably
   the same. There can be no reason to doubt, that the faithful now call
   to remembrance the things which God had formerly done for the welfare
   of his Church, with the view of inspiring their minds with stronger
   hope, as we have seen them acting in a similar manner in the beginning
   of the twenty-second psalm. They do not simply state the comparison,
   which would tend to draw a line of separation between those who have in
   former times been preserved by the power of God, and those who now
   labored and groaned under afflictions; but they rather set forth the
   covenant of God as the bond of holy alliance between them and their
   fathers, that they might conclude from this, that whatever amount of
   goodness the Church had at any time experienced in God pertained also
   to them. At first, indeed, they use the language of complaint, asking
   why it is that the course of God's fatherly favor towards his people
   is, as it were, interrupted; but straightway they correct their
   mistake, and take courage from a new consideration -- the consideration
   that God, who had adopted them as well as their fathers, is faithful
   and immutable. It is, however, no great wonder if the faithful, even in
   prayer, have in their hearts divers and conflicting affections. But the
   Holy Spirit, who dwells in them, by assuaging the violence of their
   sorrow, pacifies all their complaints and leads them patiently and
   cordially to obey. Moreover, when they here say that their fathers have
   declared to them the deliverances which God had accomplished in behalf
   of his Church, what the fathers did in this respect corresponds with
   the precept of the law, by which the fathers were commanded to teach
   their children. And all the faithful ought to reflect that the same
   charge is enjoined upon them by God even to this day. He communicates
   to them the doctrine of salvation, and commits it to their charge for
   this purpose -- that they may transmit it to their posterity, and, as
   much as in them lies, endeavor to extend its authority, that his
   worship may be preserved from age to age.

   3 For they got not possession of the land by their own sword. Here the
   sacred writer confirms by contrast what he has just said; for if they
   obtained not possession of the land by their own power and skill, it
   follows that they were planted in it by the hand of another. The
   multitude of men who went out of Egypt was very great; but not being
   trained to the art of war, and accustomed only to servile works, they
   would soon have been defeated by their enemies, who far excelled them
   in numbers and strength. In short, there were not wanting evident signs
   by which the people were made to know as well their own weakness as the
   power of God; so that it was their bounden duty to confess that the
   land was not conquered by their own sword, and also, that it was the
   hand of God which had preserved them. The Psalmist, not content with
   mentioning thy right hand, adds, thy arm, to amplify the matter, and
   give greater weight to his discourse, that we may know that they were
   preserved in a wonderful manner, and not by any ordinary means. The
   light of thy countenance is here taken, as in other places, for the
   manifestation of the divine favor. As, on the one hand, when God is
   afflicting us severely, he seems to frown upon us, and to overshadow
   his face with thick clouds; so, on the other, when the Israelites,
   sustained by his power, overthrew their enemies without any great
   difficulty, and pursued them in every direction far and near, it is
   said, that then they beheld the face of God serene and placid, just as
   if he had manifested himself in a visible manner near them. Here it is
   necessary to observe the mode of reasoning which the prophet employs,
   when he argues that it is by the free gift of God that the people
   obtained the land in heritage, seeing they had not acquired it by their
   own power. We then truly begin to yield to God what belongs to him,
   when we consider how worthless our own strength is. And certainly, the
   reason why men, as it were through disdain, conceal and forget the
   benefits which God has conferred on them, must be owing to a delusive
   imagination, which leads them to arrogate somewhat to themselves as
   properly their own. The best means, therefore, of cherishing in us
   habitually a spirit of gratitude towards God, is to expel from our
   minds this foolish opinion of our own ability. There is still in the
   concluding part of the verse another expression, which contains a more
   illustrious testimony to the grace of God, when the Psalmist resolves
   the whole into the good pleasure of God: Thou hadst a favor for them.
   The prophet does not suppose any worthiness in the person of Abraham,
   nor imagine any desert in his posterity, on account of which God dealt
   so bountifully with them, but ascribes the whole to the good pleasure
   of God. His words seem to be taken from the solemn declaration of
   Moses,

   "The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye
   were more in number than any people; (for ye were the fewest of all
   people;) but because the Lord loved you," (Deuteronomy 7:7, 8.)

   Special mention is here made of the land of Canaan; but the prophet has
   stated the general principle why it was that God vouchsafed to reckon
   that people for his flock and peculiar heritage. And certainly, the
   source and origin of the Church is the free love of God; and whatever
   benefits he bestows upon his Church, they all proceed from the same
   source. The reason, therefore, why we are gathered into the Church, and
   are nourished and defended by the hand of God, is only to be sought in
   God. Nor does the Psalmist here treat of the general benevolence of
   God, which extends to the whole human race; but he discourses of the
   difference which exists between the elect and the rest of the world;
   and the cause of this difference is here referred to the mere good
   pleasure of God.

   reading in our English version is, "and cast them out," namely, the
   heathen. But Calvin's rendering seems to be more suitable to the genius
   of the Hebrew poetry, and it also agrees with the meaning of the
   original. "The whole metaphor," says Dr Geddes, "is taken from the
   vine, or some other luxuriant tree. In our common version, and cast
   them out,' the parallelism is lost, and the beauty of the sentence
   disappears." The Hebrew verb here used is generally applied to the
   germination of plants, or to the shooting and spreading forth of
   branches. God caused his chosen people to spread abroad, to cast or
   shoot forth like the branches of a vine.

   Psalm 44:4-8

   4. Thou, even thou, art my King, [134] O God! command [or ordain]
   deliverances for Jacob. 5. Through thee we have pushed [or smitten]
   with the horn our adversaries: in thy name we have trampled under foot
   those that rose u, against us. 6. For I will not trust in my bow, and
   my sword will not save me. 7. Surely thou hast saved us from our
   enemies, and hast put to shame those that hated us. 8. In God we will
   boast all the day, and confess thy name for ever. Selah.


   4. Thou, even thou, art my King, O God! In this verse the faithful
   express still more plainly what I have already alluded to a little
   before, namely, that the goodness of God was not only apparent in the
   deliverance of his people, but also flowed upon them in continued
   succession from age to age; and therefore it is said, Thou, even thou,
   art my King In my judgment, the demonstrative pronoun hv', hu, imports
   as much as if the prophet had put together a long series of the
   benefits of God after the first deliverance; so that it might appear,
   that God, who had once been the deliverer of his people, did not show
   himself otherwise towards their posterity: unless, perhaps, it might be
   considered as emphatic, and employed for the purpose of asserting the
   thing stated the more strongly, namely, that the faithful praise God
   alone as the guardian of their welfare to the exclusion of all others,
   and the renunciation of aid from any other quarter. Hence they also
   present the prayer, that God would ordain and send forth new
   deliverances to his people; for, as he has in his power innumerable
   means of preservation and deliverance, he is said to appoint and send
   forth deliverances as his messengers wherever it seems good to him.

   5. Through thee we have pushed, or smitten, with the horn our
   adversaries. [135] The prophet here declares in what respect God had
   manifested himself to be the King of this people. He did so by
   investing them with such strength and power, that all their enemies
   stood in fear of them. The similitude, taken from bulls, which he here
   uses, tends to show, that they had been endued with more than human
   strength, by which they were enabled to assail, overturn, and trample
   under foot, every thing which opposed them. In God, and in the name of
   God, are of the same import, only the latter expression denotes, that
   the people had been victorious, because they fought under the authority
   and direction of God. It ought to be observed, that what they had
   spoken before concerning their fathers, they now apply to themselves,
   because they still formed a part of the same body of the Church.

   And they do this expressly to inspire themselves with confidence and
   courage, for had they separated themselves from their fathers, this
   distinction would, in a certain sense, have interrupted the course of
   God's grace, so that it would have ceased to flow down upon them. But
   now, since they confess that whatever God had conferred upon their
   fathers he had bestowed upon them, they may boldly desire him to
   continue his work. At the same time, it ought to be observed again in
   this place, that, as I have stated a little before, the reason why they
   ascribe their victories wholly to God is, that they were unable to
   arrive at such a consummation by their own sword or their own bow. When
   we are led to consider how great is our own weakness, and how worthless
   we are without God, this contrast much more clearly illustrates the
   grace of God. They again declare, (verse 7,) that they were saved by
   the power of God, and that he also had chased away and put to shame
   their enemies.

   8. In God we will boast [136] all the day This is the conclusion of the
   first part of the psalm. To express the meaning in a few words, they
   acknowledge, that in all ages the goodness of God had been so great
   towards the children of Abraham, that it furnished them with continual
   matter of thanksgiving. As if the thing were still present to their
   view, they acknowledge that, without ceasing, they ought to give praise
   to God, because they had flourished and triumphed, not merely for one
   age, or a short period of time, but because they had continued to do so
   successively from age to age, [137] for whatever prosperity had
   befallen them, they ascribe it to the grace of God. And, certainly, it
   is then that men experience from the prosperity which befalls them, a
   holy and a well-regulated joy, when it bursts forth in the praises of
   God. [138] Let us then, in the first place, bear in mind that this
   verse relates to the time of joy and prosperity in which God manifested
   his favor towards his people; secondly, that the faithful here manifest
   that they are not ungrateful, inasmuch as, having laid aside all vain
   boasting, they confess that all the victories by which they had become
   great and renowned proceeded from God, and that it was by his power
   alone that they had hitherto continued to exist, and had been preserved
   in safety; and, thirdly, that it was not only once or twice that matter
   of joy had been afforded them, but that this existed for a long time,
   inasmuch as God had manifested towards them, during a long and
   uninterrupted period, divers proofs and tokens of his paternal favor,
   so that the continuance, and, so to speak, the long experience they had
   had of it, ought to have been the means of confirming their hope.

   Psalm 44:9-14

   9. Nevertheless thou hast abhorred us, [139] and put us to shame: and
   thou goest not forth with our armies. 10. Thou hast made us to turn
   back from the enemy: and they that hate us have made of us a spoil for
   themselves. 11. Thou hast given us as sheep for food: and thou hast
   scattered us among the heathen. 12. Thou hast sold thy people, and not
   become rich, [140] and thou hast not increased the price of them. 13.
   Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to
   them that are round about us. 14. Thou hast made us a byword among the
   heathen, and a nodding of the head among the people.


   9. Nevertheless thou hast abhorred us Here follows a complaint, in
   which they bewail their present miseries and extreme calamity. There is
   here described such a change as showed not only that God had ceased to
   exercise towards them his accustomed favor, but also, that he was
   openly adverse and hostile to his people. First, they complain that
   they have been rejected as through hatred, for such is the proper
   import of the word zncht, zanachta, which, along with others, I have
   translated abhorred If, however, any would rather translate it to
   forget, or to be cast off, I have no great objection to it. They next
   add, that they had been put to shame, namely, because it must
   necessarily follow that every thing should go ill with them when
   deprived of the protection of God. This they declare immediately after,
   when they say, that God no longer goes forth with their armies -- goes
   forth as their leader or standard-bearer when they go forth to war.

   10. Thou hast made us to turn back from the enemy. Here the people of
   God still further complain, that he had made them to flee before their
   enemies, and had given them up as a prey to be devoured by them. As the
   saints firmly believe that men are strong and valiant only in so far as
   God upholds them by his secret power, they also conclude, that when men
   flee, and are seized with trembling, it is God who strikes them with
   terror, so that the poor wretched creatures are deprived of reason, and
   both their skill and courage fail them. The expression here used is
   taken from the Law, Deuteronomy 32:30, where Moses says,

   "How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight,
   except their Rock had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up?"

   The faithful, fully persuaded of this truth, do not ascribe to fortune
   the change which had passed over them, that those who were wont
   vigorously and fearlessly to assail their enemies, were now terrified
   by their very appearance; but they feel assured that it was by the
   appointment of heaven that they were thus discomfited, and made to flee
   before their enemies. And as they formerly confessed that the strength
   which they had hitherto possessed was the gift of God, so, on the other
   hand, they also acknowledge that the fear by which they are now
   actuated was inflicted upon them as a punishment by God. And when God
   thus deprived them of courage, they say that they are exposed to the
   will of their enemies; for in this sense I interpret the word lmv,
   lamo, which I have rendered, for themselves, namely, that their enemies
   destroyed them at their pleasure and without any resistance, as their
   prey.

   To the same purpose is that other comparison, (verse 11) in which they
   say that they were given as sheep for food [141] By this the prophet
   intimates, that being already vanquished previous to the battle, they
   fell down, as it were, upon the earth before their enemies, ready to be
   devoured by them, [142] and not fit for any thing else than to gratify
   their insatiable cruelty. It ought to be observed, that when the
   faithful represent God as the author of their calamities, it is not in
   the way of murmuring against him, but that they may with greater
   confidence seek relief, as it were, from the same hand which smote and
   wounded them. It is certainly impossible that those who impute their
   miseries to fortune can sincerely have recourse to God, or look for
   help and salvation from him. If, therefore, we would expect a remedy
   from God for our miseries, we must believe that they befall us not by
   fortune or mere chance, but that they are inflicted upon us properly by
   his hand. Having stated that they were thus abandoned to the will of
   their enemies, they add, at the same time, that they were scattered
   among the heathen: a dispersion which was a hundred times more grievous
   to them than death. The whole glory and felicity of that people
   consisted in this, that, being united under one God and one King, they
   formed one body; and that such being the case, it was a sign that the
   curse of God lay heavy upon them to be mingled among the heathen, and
   scattered hither and thither like broken members.

   12 Thou hast sold thy people, and not become rich. In saying that they
   were sold without any gain, it is meant that they were exposed to sale
   as slaves that are contemptible, and of no value. In the second clause,
   too, And hast not increased the price of them, there seems to be an
   allusion to the custom of exposing things to auction, and selling them
   to the highest bidder. We know that those slaves who were sold were not
   delivered to the buyers till the price of them had been increased by
   bidding. Thus the faithful mean, that they were cast out as being
   altogether worthless, so that their condition had been worse than that
   of any bond-slave. [143] And as they rather appeal to God than turn to
   their enemies, of whose pride and cruelty they had just cause to
   complain, let us learn from this, that there is nothing better, or more
   advantageous for us in our adversity, than to give ourselves to
   meditation upon the providence and judgment of God. When men trouble
   us, it is no doubt the devil who drives them to it, and it is with him
   we have to do; but we must, notwithstanding, raise our thoughts to God
   himself, that we may know that we are proved and tried by him, either
   to chastise us, or to exercise our patience, or to subdue the sinful
   desires of our flesh, or to humble us and train us to the practice of
   self-denial. And when we hear that the Fathers who lived under the Law
   were treated so ignominiously, there is no reason why we should lose
   courage by any outrage or ill treatment, if God should at any time see
   meet to subject us to it. It is not here said simply that God sold some
   people, but that he sold his own people, as if his own inheritance were
   of no estimation in his sight. Even at this day, we may in our prayers
   still make the same complaint, provided we, at the same time, make use
   of this example, for the purpose of supporting and establishing our
   faith, so that, however much afflicted we may be, our hearts may not
   fail us. In Isaiah 52:3, God, using the same form of speech, says that
   he sold his people without price; but there it is to be understood in a
   different sense, namely, to show that he will have no difficulty in
   redeeming them, because he is under no obligation to those that bought
   them, and had received nothing from them in return.

   13 Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbors Here the Psalmist
   speaks of their neighbors, who were all actuated either by some secret
   ill-will, or avowed enmity to the people of God. And certainly it often
   happens, that neighborhood, which ought to be the means of preserving
   mutual friendship, engenders all discord and strife. But there was a
   special reason in respect of the Jews; for they had taken possession of
   the country in spite of all men, and their religion being hateful to
   others, so to speak, served as a trumpet to stir up war, and inflamed
   their neighbors with rage against them. Many, too, cherished towards
   them a feeling of jealousy, such as the Idumeans, who were inflated on
   the ground of their circumcision, and imagined that they also
   worshipped the God of Abraham as well as the Jews. But what proved the
   greatest calamity to them was, that they were exposed to the reproach
   and derision of those who hated them on the ground of their worship of
   the true God. The faithful illustrate still farther the greatness of
   their calamity by another circumstance, telling us, in the last clause
   of the verse, that they were met by reproaches on all sides; for they
   were beset round about by their enemies, so that they would never have
   enjoyed one moment of peace unless God had miraculously preserved them.
   Nay, they add still farther, (verse 14,) that they were a proverb, a
   byword, or jest, even among the nations that were far off. The word
   msl, mashal, which is translated proverb, might be taken in the sense
   of a heavy imprecation or curse, as well as of a byword or jest; but
   the sense will be substantially the same, namely, that there were no
   people under heaven held in greater detestation, insomuch that their
   very name was bandied about every where in proverbial allusions, as a
   term of reproach. To the same purpose also is the wagging, or shaking
   of the head, which occurs in Psalm 22, of which we have already spoken.
   There can be no doubt that the faithful recognised this as inflicted
   upon them by the vengeance of God, of which mention was made in the
   Law. In order to arouse themselves to the consideration of the
   judgments of God, they carefully compared with the threatenings of God
   all the punishments which he inflicted upon them. But the Law had
   declared beforehand, in express terms, this derision of the Gentiles,
   which they now relate as a thing that had come to pass, (Deuteronomy
   28:3.) Moreover, when it is said, among the heathen, and among the
   people, the repetition is very emphatic and expressive; for it was a
   thing quite unseemly and intolerable, that the heathen nations should
   presume to torment with their scoffings the chosen people of God, and
   revile them by their blasphemies at their pleasure. That the godly
   complained not of these things without cause is abundantly obvious from
   a passage in Cicero, in his oration in defense of Flaccus, in which
   that heathen orator, with his accustomed pride, scoffs no less against
   God than against the Jews, asserting that it was perfectly clear that
   they were a nation hated of the gods, inasmuch as they had often, and,
   as it were, from age to age, been wasted with so many misfortunes, and
   in the end subjected to a most miserable bondage, and kept, as it were,
   under the feet of the Romans. [144]

   Psalm 44:15-21

   15. My reproach is daily [145] before me, and the shame of my face hath
   quite covered me, 16. Because of the voice of him who reproached me;
   because of the face of the enemy and the avenger. 17. All this has come
   upon us, and we have not forgotten thee, nor dealt falsely in thy
   covenant: 18. Our heart has not turned back, nor have our steps
   declined from thy path. 19. Although thou hast wasted us in the place
   of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death: 20. If we have
   forgotten the name of our God, and have stretched out our hands to a
   strange god: 21. Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the
   secrets of the heart.


   15 My reproach is daily before me. The Hebrew words klhyvm, col-hayom,
   mean all the day, and denote long continuance: but they may be
   understood in two ways, either for the whole or entire day, from
   morning to evening, or for continued succession of days. According to
   either of these interpretations, the meaning is, that there is no end
   to their misfortunes. As to the change of the number from the plural to
   the singular, it is not at all inconsistent that what is spoken in the
   name of the Church should be uttered, as it were, in the person of one
   man. The reason is added why they were so overwhelmed with shame, that
   they dared not to lift up their eyes and their face, namely, because
   they had no respite, but were incessantly subjected to the insolence
   and reproach of their enemies. Had they been allowed to hide themselves
   in some corner, they might have endured, as well as they were able,
   their calamities in secret; but when their enemies openly derided them
   with the greatest insolence, it served to redouble the wound inflicted
   upon them. They, therefore, complain that their calamities had
   accumulated to such an extent, that they were forced unceasingly to
   hear blasphemies and bitter reproaches. They describe their enemies by
   the epithet avengers, a term which, among the Hebrews, denotes
   barbarity and cruelty, accompanied with pride, as we have remarked on
   the [4]8th Psalm

   17 All this has come upon us, etc. As they have already attributed to
   God all the afflictions which they endured, if they should now say that
   they were undeservedly afflicted, it would be the same thing as to
   accuse God of injustice; and thus what is here spoken would no longer
   be a holy prayer, but rather an impious blasphemy. It is, however, to
   be observed, that the faithful, although in their adversities they do
   not perceive any obvious reason for being so dealt with, yet they rest
   assured of this, and regard it as a fixed principle, that God has some
   good reasons for treating them so severely. At the same time, it is
   proper to observe, that the godly do not speak in this place of the
   time past, but rather allege their patient endurance, which was no
   small token of their piety, since, in the most humble manner, they thus
   bowed their neck to the yoke of God. We see how the great majority of
   men murmur and obstinately fret against God, like refractory horses
   which rage furiously against their masters, and strike them with their
   feet. And, therefore, we know that the man who, in affliction, imposes
   a holy restraint upon himself, that he may not by any impatience be
   carried away from the path of duty, has made no inconsiderable
   attainments in the fear of God. It is an easy matter even for
   hypocrites to bless God in the time of their prosperity; but as soon as
   he begins to deal hardly with them, they break forth into a rage
   against him. Accordingly, the faithful declare that, although so many
   afflictions as they endured tended to turn them aside from the right
   path, they did not forget God, but always served him, even when he did
   not show himself favorable and merciful towards them. They do not,
   therefore, proclaim their virtues in a former and distant period of
   their history, but only allege, that even in the midst of afflictions
   they steadfastly kept the covenant of God It is well known, that long
   before the persecution of Antiochus, there were many abuses and
   corruptions which provoked the vengeance of God against them, so that,
   in respect of that period, they had no ground to boast of such
   integrity as is here described. True it is that, as we shall very soon
   see, God spared them, thus showing that they had been afflicted more
   for his name's sake than for their own sins; but the forbearance which
   God exercised towards them in this respect was not sufficient to
   warrant them to plead exemption from guilt. We must, therefore,
   consider that in this place they do nothing more than allege their own
   patience, in that, amidst such grievous and hard temptations, they had
   not turned aside from the service of God. In the first place, they
   affirm, We have not forgotten thee: for, indeed, afflictions are, as it
   were, like so many clouds which conceal heaven from our view, so that
   God might then readily slip from our remembrance, as if we were far
   removed from him. They add, secondly, We have not dealt falsely in thy
   covenant: for, as I have said, the wickedness of men discovers itself
   more especially when they are tried more severely than they had
   anticipated. Thirdly, they declare that their heart had not turned back
   And, lastly, that their footsteps declined not from the paths of God.
   As God is daily inviting us, so our hearts must be always ready to
   proceed in the paths into which he calls us. Hence follows the
   direction of our ways; for by our outward works, and by our whole life,
   we testify that our heart is unfeignedly devoted to God. Instead of the
   translation, Nor have our steps declined, which I have given, some
   suggest another reading, which is not without some degree of
   plausibility, namely, Thou hast made our steps to decline; for, in the
   first place, the term tt, tet, may be so rendered; and, secondly,
   according to the arrangement of the words, there is no negative in this
   clause. As to the meaning, however, I am not at all of their opinion;
   for they connect this passage with that in Isaiah 63:17,

   "O Lord, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways?"

   The complaint which is here made amounts rather to this, That the
   faithful are like poor wretched creatures wandering in desert places,
   seeing God had withdrawn his hand from them. The expression, The paths
   of God, does not always refer to doctrine, but sometimes to prosperous
   and desirable events.

   19 Although thou hast broken us in the place of dragons. In the Hebrew
   it is, For thou hast broken us, etc.; but the causal particle, ky, ki,
   according to the idiom of the Hebrew language, is often taken in the
   sense of although or when. [146] And certainly it must be so rendered
   in this place, for these three verses are connected, and the sentence
   is incomplete till the end of the words, For he knoweth the secrets of
   the heart. The faithful repeat more largely what we have already seen,
   namely, that although plunged into the greatest depth of miseries, yet
   they continued steadfast in their resolution, and in the right way. If
   we consider the distressing circumstances in which they were placed, it
   will not appear to us a hyperbolical mode of speech, when they say that
   they were broken even within the depths of the sea; for by the place of
   dragons I understand not the deserts and solitary places, but the
   deepest gulfs of the sea. Accordingly, the word tnym, tannim, which
   others translate dragons, [147] I would rather render whales, [148] as
   it is also understood in many other places. This interpretation is
   obviously confirmed by the following clause, in which they complain
   that they had been covered with the shadow of death, which implies that
   they were swallowed up of death itself. Let us, however, remember, that
   in these words the Holy Ghost dictates to us a form of prayer; and
   that, therefore, we are enjoined to cultivate a spirit of invincible
   fortitude and courage, which may serve to sustain us under the weight
   of all the calamities we may be called to endure, so that we may be
   able to testify of a truth, that even when reduced to the extremity of
   despair, we have never ceased to trust in God; that no temptations,
   however unexpected, could expel his fear from our hearts; and, in fine,
   that we were never so overwhelmed by the burden of our afflictions,
   however great, as not to have our eyes always directed to him. But it
   is proper for us to notice still more particularly the style of
   speaking here employed by the faithful. In order to show that they
   still continued steadfastly in the pure service of God, they affirm
   that they have not lifted up their hearts or their hands to any but to
   the God of Israel alone. It would not have been enough for them to have
   cherished some confused notion of the Deity: it was necessary that they
   should receive in its purity the true religion. Even those who murmur
   against God may be constrained to acknowledge some Divinity; but they
   frame for themselves a god after their own pleasure. And this is an
   artifice of the devil, who, because he cannot at once eradicate from
   our hearts all sense of religion, endeavors to overthrow our faith, by
   suggesting to our minds these devices -- that we must seek another God;
   or that the God whom we have hitherto served must be appeased after
   another manner; or else that the assurance of his favor must be sought
   elsewhere than in the Law and the Gospel. Since, then, it is a much
   more difficult matter for men, amidst the tossings and waves of
   adversity, to continue steadfast and tranquil in the true faith, we
   must carefully observe the protestation which the Holy Fathers here
   make, that even when reduced to the lowest extremity of distress by
   calamities of every kind, they nevertheless did not cease to trust in
   the true God.

   This they express still more clearly in the following clause, in which
   they say, We have not stretched out our hands [149] to a strange god.
   By these words they intimate, that, contented with God alone, they did
   not suffer their hopes to be divided on different objects, nor gazed
   around them in search of other means of assistance. Hence we learn,
   that those whose hearts are thus divided and distracted by various
   expectations are forgetful of the true God, to whom we fail to yield
   the honor which is due to him, if we do not repose with confidence in
   him alone. And certainly, in the true and rightful service of God,
   faith and supplication which proceeds from it hold the first place: for
   we are guilty of depriving him of the chief part of his glory, when we
   seek apart from him in the least degree our own welfare. Let us then
   bear in mind, that it is a true test of our piety, when, being plunged
   into the lowest depths of disasters, we lift up our eyes, our hopes,
   and our prayers, to God alone. And it only serves to demonstrate more
   convincingly and clearly the impiety of Popery, when, after having
   confessed their faith in the one true God with the mouth, its rotaries
   the next moment degrade his glory by ascribing it to created objects.
   They indeed excuse themselves by alleging, that in having recourse to
   Saint Christopher and other saints of their own making, they do not
   claim for them the rank of Deity, but only employ them as intercessors
   with God to obtain his favor. It is, however, well known to every one,
   that the form of the prayers which they address to the saints, [150] is
   in no respects different from those prayers which they present to God.
   Besides, although we should yield this point to them, it will still be
   a frivolous excuse to pretend that they are seeking advocates or
   intercessors for themselves. This is as much as to say, that Christ is
   not sufficient for them, or rather, that his office is wholly lost
   sight of among them. Moreover, we should carefully observe the scope of
   this passage. The faithful declare, that they did not stretch forth
   their hands to other gods, because it is an error too common among men
   to forsake God, and to seek for other means of relief when they find
   that their afflictions continue to oppress them. So long as we are
   gently and affectionately treated of God we resort to him, but as soon
   as any adversity befalls us we begin to doubt. And if we are pressed
   still further, or if there be no end to our afflictions, the very
   continuance of them tempts us to despair; and despair generates various
   kinds of false confidence. Hence arises a multitude of new gods framed
   after the fancy of men. Of the lifting up of the hands we have spoken
   elsewhere.

   21 Shall not God search this out? We have here a solemn and emphatic
   protestation, in which the people of God dare to appeal to him as the
   judge of their integrity and uprightness. From this it appears, that
   they did not plead their cause openly before men, but communed with
   themselves as if they had been before the judgment-seat of God; and
   moreover, as a token of still greater confidence, they add, that
   nothing is hidden from God. Why is it that hypocrites often call God to
   witness, if it is not because they imagine that, by concealing their
   wickedness under some specious disguise, they have escaped the judgment
   of God? and thus they would represent the character of God to be
   different from what it is, as if by their deceptions they could dazzle
   his eyes. Whenever, therefore, we come before God, let us at the same
   time remember, that there is nothing to be gained by any vain pretense
   in his presence, inasmuch as he knows the heart.

   The place of dragons, observes Bishop Mant, appears to mean the

   that vipers, especially in the wilderness of Sin, which might be called
   the inheritance of dragons, (see Malachi 1:3,) were very dangerous and

   to dwell in some gloomy wilderness infested by serpents; or that the
   fierce and cruel persecutors into whose hands God had delivered them
   are compared to serpents, and that the circumstances in which the

   Psalm 44:22-26

   22. Surely for thy sake we are killed all the day; we are accounted as
   sheep for slaughter. 23. Arise, O Lord! why sleepest thou? awake, do
   not forget us or ever. [151] 24. Why hidest thou thy face? wilt thou
   forget our misery and our affliction [152] 25. For our soul is humbled
   to the dust: our belly cleaveth to the earth. 26. Arise for our help,
   and redeem us, for thy goodness' sake.


   22 Surely for thy sake we are killed all the day. Here the faithful
   urge another reason why God should show mercy to them, namely, that
   they are subjected to sufferings not on account of crimes committed by
   themselves, but simply because the ungodly, from hatred to the name of
   God, are opposed to them. "This," it may be said, "seems at first sight
   a foolish complaint, for the answer which Socrates gave to his wife was
   apparently more to the purpose, when, upon her lamenting that he was
   about to die wrongfully, [153] he reproved her saying, That it was
   better for him to die innocently than from any fault of his own. And
   even the consolation which Christ sets forth

   Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake,'
   Matthew 5:10,

   seems to differ widely from the language here expressed by the people
   of God. It seems also opposed to what Peter says,

   Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed;
   but let him glorify God on this behalf.' --1 Peter 4:16,

   "To this I answer, That although it is the greatest alleviation of our
   sorrow that the cause for which we suffer is common to us with Christ
   himself, yet it is neither in vain nor out of place that the faithful
   here plead with God that they suffer wrongfully for his sake, in order
   that he may the more vigorously set himself for their defense. It is
   right that he should have respect to the maintenance of his glory,
   which the wicked endeavor to overthrow, when they insolently persecute
   those who serve him. And from this it appears the more clearly that
   this psalm was composed when the people languished in captivity, or
   else when Antiochus laid waste the Church, because religion was at that
   time the cause of suffering. The Babylonians were enraged by the
   constancy of the people, when they perceived that the whole body of the
   Jews, vanquished and routed as they were, ceased not on that account to
   condemn the superstitions of the country; and the rage of Antiochus was
   wholly bent upon extinguishing entirely the name of God. Moreover, what
   made the thing appear more strange and difficult to bear was, that God,
   so far from repressing the insolence and the wrongs inflicted by the
   wicked, left them, on the contrary, to continue in their cruelty, and
   gave them, as it were, loose reins. Accordingly, the godly declare that
   they are killed all the day long, and that they are counted of no more
   value than sheep for slaughter It is, however, proper always to bear in
   mind, what I have already remarked, that they were not so free from all
   blame as that God, in afflicting them, might not justly chastise them
   for their sins. But whilst in his incomparable goodness he fully
   pardons all our sins, he yet allows us to be exposed to unmerited
   persecutions, that we may with greater alacrity glory in bearing the
   cross with Christ, and thereby become partakers with him in his blessed
   resurrection. We have already said, that there was no other reason why
   the rage of the enemy was so inflamed against them, but that the people
   would not revolt from the law, and renounce the worship of the true
   God. It now remains for us to apply this doctrine to our own
   circumstances; and, first, let us consider that it becomes us, after
   the example of the fathers, patiently to submit to the afflictions by
   which it is necessary to seal the confession of our faith; and,
   secondly, that even in the deepest afflictions we must continue to call
   upon the name of God and abide in his fear. Paul, however, in his
   Epistle to the Romans, chapter 8:36, proceeds still farther; for he
   quotes this not only by way of example, but also affirms that the
   condition of the Church in all ages is here portrayed. Thus, then, we
   ought to regard it as a settled point, that a state of continual
   warfare in bearing the cross is enjoined upon us by divine appointment.
   Sometimes, it is true, a truce or respite may be granted us; for God,
   has compassion upon our infirmity: but although the sword of
   persecution is not always unsheathed against us, yet, as we are the
   members of Christ, it behoves us always to be ready to bear the cross
   with him. Lest, therefore, the severity of the cross should dismay us,
   let us always have present to our view this condition of the Church,
   that as we are adopted in Christ, we are appointed to the slaughter. If
   we neglect to do this, the same thing will befall us which happens to
   many apostates; for as it is in their judgment too severe and wretched
   a state, even while they live, to be continually dying, to be exposed
   to the mockery of others, and not to have one moment free from fear, --
   to rid themselves of that necessity they shamefully forsake and deny
   Christ. In order, therefore, that weariness, or dread of the cross, may
   not root up from our hearts true godliness, let us continually reflect
   upon this, that it behoves us to drink the cup which God puts into our
   hands, and that no one can be a Christian who does not dedicate himself
   to God.

   23 Arise, O Lord! why sleepest thou? Here the saints desire that God,
   having pity upon them, would at length send them help and deliverance.
   Although God allows the saints to plead with him in this babbling
   manner, when in their prayers they desire him to rise up or awake; yet
   it is necessary that they should be fully persuaded that he keeps watch
   for their safety and defense. We must guard against the notion of
   Epicurus, who framed to himself a god who, having his abode in heaven,
   [154] delighted only in idleness and pleasure. But as the insensibility
   of our nature is so great, that we do not at once comprehend the care
   which God has of us, the godly here request that he would be pleased to
   give some evidence that he was neither forgetful of them nor slow to
   help them. We must, indeed, firmly believe that God ceases not to
   regard us, although he appears not to do so; yet as such an assurance
   is of faith, and not of the flesh, that is to say, is not natural to
   us, [155] the faithful familiarly give utterance before God to this
   contrary sentiment, which they conceive from the state of things as it
   is presented to their view; and in doing so, they discharge from their
   breasts those morbid affections which belong to the corruption of our
   nature, in consequence of which faith then shines forth in its pure and
   native character. If it is objected, that prayer, than which nothing is
   more holy, is defiled, when some froward imagination of the flesh is
   mingled with it, I confess that this is true; but in using this
   freedom, which the Lord vouchsafes to us, let us consider that, in his
   goodness and mercy, by which he sustains us, he wipes away this fault,
   that our prayers may not be defiled by it.

   25 For our soul is humbled to the dust The people of God again deplore
   the greatness of their calamities, and in order that God may be the
   more disposed to help them, they declare to him that they are afflicted
   in no ordinary manner. By the metaphors which they here employ, they
   mean not only that they are cast down, but also that they are crushed
   and laid upon the earth, so that they are not able to rise again. Some
   take the word soul for the body, so that there would be in this verse a
   repetition of the same sentiment; but I would rather take it for the
   part in which the life of man consists; as if they had said, We are
   cast down to the earth, and lie prostrate upon our belly, without any
   hope of getting up again. After this complaint they subjoin a prayer,
   (verse 26,) that God would arise for their help By the word redeem they
   mean not ordinary kind of help, for there was no other means of
   securing their preservation but by redeeming them. And yet there can be
   no doubt, that they were diligently employed in meditating upon the
   great redemption from which all the deliverances which God is daily
   effecting in our behalf, when he defends us from dangers by various
   means, flow as streams from their source. In a previous part of the
   psalm, they had boasted of the steadfastness of their faith; but to
   show us that, in using this language, they boasted not in their own
   merits, they do not claim here some recompense for what they had done
   and suffered for God. They are contented to ascribe their salvation to
   the unmerited goodness of God as the alone cause of it.

   the same period. There is, certainly, no part of the history of the
   Jews with which we are acquainted, to which the statement made in the
   17th verse is so applicable as to the time when they were so cruelly
   persecuted for their religion by Antiochus Epiphanes, King of Syria,
   and when, notwithstanding, the great mass of the people displayed an
   invincible determination to keep themselves from the pollutions of
   idolatry, and to adhere to the worship of the true God.

   PSALM 45

   In this psalm, the grace and beauty of Solomon, his virtues in ruling
   the kingdom, and also his power and riches, are illustrated and
   described in terms of high commendation. More especially, as he had
   taken to wife a stranger out of Egypt, the blessing of God is promised
   to him in this relationship, provided the newly espoused bride, bidding
   adieu to her own nation, and renouncing all attachment to it, devote
   herself wholly to her husband. At the same time, there can be no doubt,
   that under this figure the majesty, wealth, and extent of Christ's
   kingdom are described and illustrated by appropriate terms, to teach
   the faithful that there is no felicity greater or more desirable than
   to live under the reign of this king, and to be subject to his
   government.

   To the chief musician upon the lilies; of the sons of Korah;
   for instruction; a song of loves.

   It is well known that this psalm was composed concerning Solomon; but
   it is uncertain who was its author. It is, in my opinion, probable,
   that some one of the prophets or godly teachers (whether after
   Solo-men's death, or while he was yet alive, it is of no importance to
   inquire) took this as the subject of his discourse, with the design of
   showing, that whatever excellence had been seen in Solomon had a higher
   application. This psalm is called a song of loves, not, as some
   suppose, because it illustrates the fatherly love of God, as to the
   benefits which he had conferred in such a distinguished manner upon
   Solomon, but because it contains an expression of rejoicing on account
   of his happy and prosperous marriage. Thus the words, of loves, are put
   for a descriptive epithet, and denote, that it is a love-song. Indeed,
   Solomon was called ydydyh, Yedidyah, which means beloved of the Lord, 2
   Samuel 12:25. But the context, in my opinion, requires that this term
   yrydvt, yedidoth, that is to say, loves, be understood as referring to
   the mutual love which husband and wife ought to cherish towards each
   other. But as the word loves is sometimes taken in a bad sense, and as
   even conjugal affection itself, however well regulated, has always some
   irregularity of the flesh mingled with it; this song is, at the same
   time, called mskyl, maskil, to teach us, that the subject here treated
   of is not some obscene or unchaste amours, but that, under what is here
   said of Solomon as a type, the holy and divine union of Christ and his
   Church is described and set forth. As to the remaining part of the
   inscription, interpreters explain it in various ways. svsn, shushan,
   properly signifies a lily; and the sixtieth psalm has in its
   inscription the same term in the singular number. Here, and in the
   eightieth psalm, the plural number is employed. It is therefore
   probable, that it was either the beginning of a common song, or else
   some instrument of music. But as this is a matter of no great
   consequence, I give no opinion, but leave it undecided; for, without
   any danger to the truth, every one may freely adopt on this point
   whatever view he chooses.

   Psalm 45:1-5

   1. My heart is boiling over with a good matter: I shall speak of the
   works which I have made concerning the king: my tongue is as the pen of
   a swift writer. 2. Thou art fairer than the sons of men: grace is
   poured into thy lips; because God hath blessed thee for ever. 3. Gird
   thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one! with glory and majesty. [156]
   4. And in thy majesty do thou prosper: ride forth upon the word of
   truth, and meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach
   thee terrible things. 5. Thine arrows are sharp (so that the people
   fall under thee) in the heart of the enemies of the King.


   1 My heart is boiling over [157] with a good matter This preface shows
   sufficiently that the subject of the psalm is no common one; for
   whoever the author of it may have been, he here intimates, at the very
   outset, that he will treat of great and glorious things. The Holy
   Spirit is not accustomed to inspire the servants of God to utter great
   swelling words, and to pour forth empty sounds into the air; and,
   therefore, we may naturally conclude, that the subject here treated of
   is not merely a transitory and earthly kingdom, but sortie-thing more
   excellent. Were not this the case, what end would it serve to announce,
   as the prophet does in such a magnificent style, that his heart was
   boiling over, from his ardent desire to be employed in rehearsing the
   praises of the king? Some prefer to translate the word to utter; but
   the other signification of the word appears to me to be more
   appropriate; and it is confirmed by this, that from this verb is
   derived the noun mrhst, marchesheth, a word which is found once or
   twice in Moses, and signifies a frying-pan, in which sweatmeats are
   baked. It is then of the same import as if the inspired writer had
   said, My heart is ready to breathe forth something excellent and worthy
   of being remembered. He afterwards expresses the harmony between the
   tongue and the heart, when he compares his tongue to the pen of a swift
   and ready writer

   2. Thou art fairer than the sons of men. The Psalmist commences his
   subject with the commendation of the beauty of the king, and then he
   proceeds also to praise his eloquence. Personal excellence is ascribed
   to the king, not that the beauty of the countenance, which of itself is
   not reckoned among the number of the virtues, ought to be very highly
   valued; but because a noble disposition of mind often shines forth in
   the very countenance of a man. This may have been the case with
   Solomon, so that from his very countenance it might have appeared that
   he was endued with superior gifts. Nor is the grace of oratory
   undeservedly commended in a king, to whom it belongs, by virtue of his
   office, not only to rule the people by authority, but also to allure
   them to obedience by argument and eloquence, just as the ancients
   feigned that Hercules had in his mouth golden chains, by which he
   captivated the ears of the common people, and drew them after him. How
   manifestly does this rebuke the mean-spiritedness of kings in our day,
   by whom it is regarded as derogatory to their dignity to converse with
   their subjects, and to employ remonstrance in order to secure their
   submission; nay, who display a spirit of barbarous tyranny in seeking
   rather to compel than to persuade them, and in choosing rather to abuse
   them as slaves, than to govern them by laws and with justice as a
   tractable and obedient people. But as this excellence was displayed in
   Solomon, so also did it shine forth more fully afterwards in Christ, to
   whom his truth serves the part of a scepter, as we shall have occasion
   by and by to notice mere at large. The term l-kn, al-ken, which we have
   translated because, is sometimes rendered wherefore; but it is not
   necessary that we should interpret it in this place in the latter
   sense, as if Solomon had been blessed on account of his beauty and
   excellence, for both of these are blessings of God. It is rather to be
   understood as the reason why Solomon was distinguished for these
   endowments, namely, because God had blessed him. As to the
   interpretation which others give, God shall bless thee for thy
   excellency, it is both cold and forced.

   3. Gird thy sword upon thy thigh. Here Solomon is praised as well for
   his warlike valor, which strikes terror into ]his enemies, as for his
   virtues which give him authority among his subjects, and secure him
   their reverence. On the one hand, no king will be able to preserve and
   defend his subjects, unless he is formidable to his enemies; and, on
   the other hand, it will be to little purpose to make war boldly upon
   foreign realms, if the internal state of his own kingdom is not
   established and regulated in uprightness and justice. Accordingly, the
   inspired writer says, that the sword with which he will be girded will
   be, in the first place, a token of warlike prowess to repel and rout
   his enemies; and, secondly, of authority also, that he might not be
   held in contempt among his own subjects. He adds, at the same time,
   that the glory which he will obtain will not be a merely transient
   thing, like the pomp and vain-glory of kings, which soon decay, but
   will be of lasting duration, and will greatly increase.

   He then comes to speak of the virtues which flourish most in a time of
   peace, and which, by an appropriate similitude, he shows to be the true
   means of adding strength and prosperity to a kingdom. At first sight,
   indeed, it seems to be a strange and inelegant mode of expression, to
   speak of riding upon truth, meekness, and righteousness, (verse 4;)
   but, as I have said, he very suitably compares these virtues to
   chariots, in which the king is conspicuously borne aloft with great
   majesty. These virtues he opposes not only to the vain pomp and parade
   in which earthly kings proudly boast; but also to the vices and
   corruptions by which they endeavor most commonly to acquire authority
   and renown. Solomon himself

   "Mercy and truth preserve the king;
   and his throne is upholden by mercy."-- Proverbs 20:28

   But, on the contrary, when worldly kings desire to enlarge their
   dominions, and to increase their power, ambition, pride, fierceness,
   cruelty, exactions, rapine, and violence, are the horses and chariots
   which they employ to accomplish their ends; and, therefore, it is not
   to be wondered at if God should very often cast them down, when thus
   elated with pride and vain-glory, from their tottering and decayed
   thrones. For kings, then, to cultivate faithfulness and justice, and to
   temper their government with mercy and kindness, is the true and solid
   foundation of kingdoms. The latter clause of the verse intimates, that
   every thing which Solomon undertakes shall prosper, provided he combine
   with warlike courage the qualities of justice and mercy. Kings who are
   carried headlong with a blind and violent impulse, may for a time
   spread terror and consternation around them; but they soon fall by the
   force of their own efforts. Due moderation, therefore, and uniform
   self-restraint, are the best means for making the hands of the valiant
   to be feared and dreaded.

   5. Thy arrows are sharp, etc. Here the Psalmist again refers to warlike
   power, when he says that the arrows of the king shall be sharp, so that
   they shall pierce the hearts of his enemies; by which he intimates that
   he has weapons in his hand with which to strike, even at a distance,
   all his enemies, whoever they may be, who resist his authority. In the
   same sense also he says that the people shall fall under him; as if it
   had been said, Whoever shall engage in the attempt to shake the
   stability of his kingdom shall miserably perish, for the king has in
   his hand a sufficiency of power to break the stubbornness of all such
   persons.

   that it could not contain; and the opening of the poem evinces that it
   was so, for he abruptly breaks forth into an annunciation of its
   subject as if impatient of restraint. Ainsworth thinks there is here an
   allusion to the boiling of the minchah, or meat-offering under the law
   in the frying-pan, (Leviticus 7:9.) It was there boiled in oil, being
   made of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil, (Leviticus 11:5;) and

   Psalm 45:6-7

   6. Thy throne, O God: is for ever and ever the sceptre of thy kingdom
   is the sceptre of equity. 7. Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest
   wickedness: because God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of
   gladness above thy fellows.


   6. Thy throne, O God! is for ever and ever. In this verse the Psalmist
   commends other princely virtues in Solomon, namely, the eternal
   duration of his throne, and then the justice and rectitude of his mode
   of government. The Jews, indeed, explain this passage as if the
   discourse were addressed to God, but such an interpretation is
   frivolous and impertinent. Others of them read the word 'lhym, Elohim,
   in the genitive case, and translate it of God, thus: The throne of thy
   God But for this there is no foundation, and it only betrays their
   presumption in not hesitating to wrest the Scriptures so shamefully,
   that they may not be constrained to acknowledge the divinity of the
   Messiah. [158] The simple and natural sense is, that Solomon reigns not
   tyrannically, as the most of kings do, but by just and equal laws, and
   that, therefore, his throne shall be established for ever. Although he
   is called God, because God has imprinted some mark of his glory in the
   person of kings, yet this title cannot well be applied to a mortal man;
   for we nowhere read in Scripture that man or angel has been
   distinguished by this title without some qualification. It is true,
   indeed, that angels as well as judges are called collectively 'lhym,
   Elohim, gods; but not individually, and no one man is called by this
   name without some word added by way of restriction, as when Moses was
   appointed to be a god to Pharaoh, (Exodus 7:1.) From this we may
   naturally infer, that this psalm relates, as we shall soon see, to a
   higher than any earthly kingdom.

   In the next verse there is set before us a fuller statement of the
   righteousness for which this monarch is distinguished; for we are told
   that he is no less strict in, the punishment of iniquity than in
   maintaining justice. We know how many and great evils are engendered by
   impunity and license in doing evil, when kings are negligent and slack
   in punishing crimes. Hence the old proverb, That it is better to live
   under a prince who gives no allowance, than under one who imposes no
   restraint. To the same purpose also is the well-known sentiment of
   Solomon,

   "He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even
   they both are abomination to the Lord." --
   (Proverbs 17:15)

   Just and rightful government, therefore, consists of these two parts:
   first, That they who rule should carefully restrain wickedness; and,
   secondly, That they should vigorously maintain righteousness; even as
   Plato has well and wisely said, that civil government consists of two
   parts -- rewards and punishments. When the Psalmist adds, that the king
   was anointed above his fellows, this is not to be understood as the
   effect or fruit of his righteousness, but rather as the cause of it:
   for the love of uprightness and equity by which Solomon was actuated
   arose from the fact, that he was divinely appointed to the kingdom. In
   ordaining him to the honor of authority and empire, Jehovah, at the
   same time, furnished him with the necessary endowments. The particle
   l-km al-ken, therefore, as in the former instance, is to be understood
   here in the sense of because; as if it had been said, It is no wonder
   that Solomon is so illustrious for his love of justice, since, from the
   number of all his brethren, he was chosen to be consecrated king by
   holy anointing. Even before he was born, he was solemnly named by a
   divine oracle, as successor to the kingdom, and when he was elevated to
   the throne, he was also adorned with princely virtues. From this it
   follows, that anointing in respect of order preceded righteousness, and
   that, therefore, righteousness cannot be accounted the cause of the
   anointing. The royal dignity is called the oil of gladness, because of
   the effect of it; for the felicity and welfare of the Church depended
   upon the kingdom promised to the house of David. [159]

   Hitherto, I have explained the text in the literal sense. But it is
   necessary that I should now proceed to illustrate somewhat more largely
   the comparison of Solomon with Christ, which I have only cursorily
   noticed. It would be quite sufficient for the pious and humble simply
   to state what is obvious, from the usual tenor of Scripture, that the
   posterity of David typically represented Christ to the ancient people
   of God; but as the Jews and other ungodly men refuse to submit
   cordially to the force of truth, it is of importance to show briefly
   from the context itself, the principal reasons from which it appears
   that some of the things here spoken are not applicable fully and
   perfectly to Solomon. As I intimated at the outset, the design of the
   prophet who composed this psalm was to confirm the hearts of the
   faithful, and to guard them against the terror and alarm with which the
   melancholy change that happened soon after might fill their minds. An
   everlasting duration, it might be said, had been promised to this
   kingdom, and it fell into decay after the death of one man. To this
   objection, therefore, the prophet replies, that although Rehoboam, who
   was the first successor of that glorious and powerful king, had his
   sovereignty reduced within narrow limits, so that a great part of the
   people were cut off and placed beyond the bounds of his dominion, yet
   that was no reason why the faith of the Church should fail; for in the
   kingdom of Solomon God had exhibited a type or figure of that
   everlasting kingdom which was still to be looked for and expected. In
   the first place, the name of king is ascribed to Solomon, simply by way
   of eminence, to teach us, that what is here said is not spoken of any
   common or ordinary king, but of that illustrious sovereign, whose
   throne God had promised should endure as long as the sun and moon
   continued to shine in the heavens, (Psalm 72:5.) David certainly was
   king, and so were those who succeeded Solomon. It is necessary then to
   observe, that there is in this term some special significance, as if
   the Holy Spirit had selected this one man from all others, to
   distinguish him by the highest mark of sovereignty. Besides, how
   inconsistent would it be to commend very highly warlike valor in
   Solomon, who was a man of a meek and quiet disposition, and who having
   ascended the throne when the kingdom enjoyed tranquillity and peace,
   devoted himself only to the cultivation of those things that are
   suitable to a time of peace, and never distinguished himself by any
   action in battle? But, above all, no clearer testimony could be adduced
   of the application of this psalm to Christ, than what is here said of
   the eternal duration of the kingdom. There can be no doubt, that
   allusion is here made to the holy oracle of which I have already made
   mention, That as long as the sun and moon shall endure in the heavens
   the throne of David shall endure. Even the Jews themselves are
   constrained to refer this to the Messiah. Accordingly, although the
   prophet commenced his discourse concerning the son of David, there can
   be no doubt, that, guided by the Holy Spirit to a higher strain, he
   comprehended the kingdom of the true and everlasting Messiah. Besides,
   there is the name 'lhym, Elohim, which it is proper to notice. It is no
   doubt also applied both to angels and men, but it cannot be applied to
   a mere man without qualification. And, therefore, the divine majesty of
   Christ, beyond all question, is expressly denoted here. [160]

   I now proceed to notice the several parts, which however I shall only
   refer to briefly in passing. We have said that while this song is
   called a love song, or wedding song, stilldivine instruction is made to
   hold the most prominent place in it, lest our imaginations should lead
   us to regard it as referring to some lascivious and carnal amours. We
   know also, that in the same sense Christ is called "the perfection of
   beauty;" not that there was any striking display of it in his
   countenance, as some men grossly imagine, but because he was
   distinguished by the possession of singular gifts and graces, in which
   he far excelled all others. Nor is it an unusual style of speaking,
   that what is spiritual in Christ should be described under the form of
   earthly figures. The kingdom of Christ, it is said, shall be opulent;
   and in addition to this it is said, that it shall attain to a state of
   great glory, such as we see where there is great prosperity and vast
   power. In this description there is included also abundance of
   pleasures. Now, there is nothing of all this that applies literally to
   the kingdom of Christ, which is separated from the pomps of this world.
   But as it was the design of the prophets to adapt their instruction to
   the capacity of God's ancient people, so in describing the kingdom of
   Christ, and the worship of God which ought to be observed in it, they
   employ figures taken from the ceremonies of the Law. If we bear in mind
   this mode of statement, in accordance with which such descriptions are
   made, there will no longer be any obscurity in this passage. It is also
   deserving of our notice, that, after the Psalmist has commended this
   heavenly king for his eloquence, he also describes him as armed with
   his sword. As, on the one hand, he governs by the influence of
   persuasion, those who willingly submit to his authority, and manifest
   docility of disposition; so, on the other hand, as there have been in
   all ages, and will continue to be, many who are rebellious and
   disobedient, it is necessary that the unbelieving should be made to
   feel in their own destruction that Christ has not come unarmed. While,
   therefore, he, is alluring us with meekness and kindness to himself,
   let us promptly and submissively yield to his authority, lest he should
   fall upon us, armed as he is with his sword and with deadly arrows. It
   is said, indeed, with much propriety, that grace is poured into his
   lips; for the Gospel, in its very nature, breathes the odour of life:
   but if we are stubborn and rebellious, this grace will become a ground
   of terror, and Christ himself will convert the very doctrine of his
   salvation into a sword and arrows against us. From this also there
   arises no small consolation to us, that the multitude and insolence of
   the adversaries of Christ may not discourage us. We know well with what
   arrogance the Papists reject Jesus Christ, whom, nevertheless, they
   boast to be their King; we know also with what profane contempt the
   greater part of the world deride him, and how frowardly the Turks and
   Jews reproach him. In the midst of such disorder, let us remember this
   prophecy, That Christ has no want of a sword and arrows to overthrow
   and destroy his enemies. Here I will again briefly repeat what I have
   noticed above, namely, that however much the Jews endeavor by their
   cavillings to pervert the sense of this verse, Thy throne, O God! is
   for ever and ever, yet it is sufficient of itself to establish the
   eternal divinity of Christ: for when the name 'lhym, Elohim is ascribed
   either to angels or men, some other mark is at the same time usually
   added, to distinguish between them and the only true God; but here it
   is applied to Christ, simply and without any qualification. It is of
   importance, however, to notice, that Christ is here spoken of as he is

   "God manifested in the flesh," -- (1 Timothy 3:16.)

   He is also called God, as he is the Word, begotten of the Father before
   all worlds; but he is here set forth in the character of Mediator, and
   on this account also mention is made of him a little after, as being
   subject to God. And, indeed, if you limit to his divine nature what is
   here said of the everlasting duration of his kingdom, we shall be
   deprived of the inestimable benefit which redounds to us from this
   doctrine, when we learn that, as he is the head of the Church, the
   author and protector of our welfare, he reigns not merely for a time,
   but possesses an endless sovereignty; for from this we derive our
   greatest confidence both in life and in death. From the following verse
   also it clearly appears, that Christ is here exhibited to us in the
   character of Mediator; for he is said to have been anointed of God,
   yea, even above his fellows, (Isaiah 42:1; Hebrews 2:17.) This,
   however, cannot apply to the eternal Word of God, but to Christ in the
   flesh, and in this character he is both the servant of God and our
   brother.

   [159] "Promis a la maison de David." -- Fr.

   [160] It is somewhat strange, after making the above observations, that
   Calvin should consider this beautiful psalm as referring primarily to
   Solomon, and to his marriage with the daughter of Pharaoh. That this is
   an epithalamium or nuptial song, is readily admitted; but that it
   refers to the nuptials of Solomon with Pharaoh's daughter, there seems
   no just ground for concluding. If Solomon could not be described as
   "fairer than the children of men," as "a mighty warrior," as "a
   victorious conqueror," as "a prince, whose throne is for ever and
   ever;" -- if the name "God" could not be applied to him; -- if it could
   not be said that his "children," in the room of their father, were made
   princes in all the earth," (verse 16;) that "his name" "would be
   remembered in all generations," and that "the people would praise him
   for ever and ever," (verse 17;) -- if these things could not be spoken
   of him without much incongruity, it may well be doubted whether the
   primary application of this psalm is to him. Besides, although Solomon
   was a type of Christ, he was not so in all things, and there is nothing
   in this poem, nor in any other part of Scripture, which can lead us to
   regard the marriage of this prince with the daughter of Pharaoh as an
   image or type of the mystical marriage of Jesus Christ to the Church.
   We therefore agree with Rosenmüller, that "the notion of Rudinger and
   Grotius," and other critics, "that this song is an epithalamium -- a
   song in celebration of the marriage of Solomon, and his chief wife, the
   daughter of Pharaoh, (1 Kings 3:5,) is altogether to be abandoned;" and
   that it applies exclusively to the Messiah, and to the mystical union
   between him and his Church; set forth in an allegory borrowed from the
   manners of an Eastern court, and under the image of conjugal love, he
   being represented as the bridegroom, and the Church as his bride. --

   Psalm 45:8-12

   8. All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the
   ivory palaces, whence they have made thee glad 9. The daughters of
   kings were among thy honorable women: [161] thy consort stood on thy
   right hand [162] in gold of Ophir. [163] 10. Hearken, O daughter! And
   consider, and incline thy ear; and forget thy own people and thy
   father's house. 11. And the King shall greatly desire thy beauty: for
   he is thy Lord, and thou shalt worship him. [164] 12. And the daughter
   of Tyre with a gift: the rich among the people shall entreat thy face.


   8. All thy garments smell of myrrh As to the signification of the words
   I am not disposed to contend much, for I find that even the Jews are
   not agreed among themselves as to the meaning of the third word, except
   that from the similarity of pronunciation it may be conjectured to
   denote cassia. It is sufficient that we understand the prophet as
   meaning that the garments of the king are perfumed with precious and
   sweet-smelling odours. He describes Solomon coming forth from his ivory
   palace amidst shoutings of universal applause and joy. I explain not
   the word mny, minni, Out of me, because no tolerable meaning can be
   drawn from this. I translate it whence, [165] and refer it to the ivory
   palaces Superfluity and excess in pleasures cannot be justified, not
   only in the common people, but not even in kings; yet, on the other
   hand, it is necessary to guard against too much austerity, that we may
   not condemn the moderate display of grandeur which is suitable to their
   dignity, even as, a little after, the prophet describes the queen
   sumptuously and royally apparelled. [166] We must, however, at the same
   time, consider that all that is here commended in Solomon was not
   approved of by God. Not to speak of other things, it is well known that
   from the very first the sin of polygamy was a thing displeasing to God,
   and yet concubines are here spoken of as included among the blessings
   of God, for there is no reason to doubt that by the honorable women, or
   maids of honor, [167] the prophet means Solomon's wives, of whom
   mention is made in another place. The daughter of the king of Egypt,
   whom Solomon had married, was his principal wife, and the first in rank
   [168] but it appears that the others, whom sacred history describes as
   occupying an inferior rank, were provided for in a liberal and
   honorable manner. These the prophet calls the daughters of kings,
   because some of them were descended of the royal blood. In what sense,
   then, it might be asked, does the prophet account it among the praises
   of Solomon that he had many wives, -- a thing which God condemns in all
   private persons, but expressly in kings? (Deuteronomy 17:17.) Doubtless
   it may easily be inferred that in commending, according to a common
   practice, the wealth and glory of the king, as the prophet here does,
   he did not mean to approve of the abuse of them. It was not his design
   to set forth the example of a man in opposition to the law of God. It
   is true, indeed, that the power, dignity, and glory, which Solomon
   enjoyed, were granted to him as singular blessings from God; but as
   generally happens, he defiled them greatly by not exercising
   self-control, and in abusing the great abundance with which he was
   blessed, by the excessive indulgence of the flesh. In short, it is here
   recorded what great liberality God manifested towards Solomon in giving
   him every thing in abundance. As to the fact that he took to him so
   many wives, and did not exercise a due moderation in his pomp, this is
   not to be included in the liberality of God, but is a thing as it were
   accidental.

   10. Hearken, O daughter! and consider I have no doubt, that what is
   here said is spoken of the Egyptian woman, whom the prophet has
   described as standing at the right hand of the king. It was not,
   indeed, lawful for Solomon to marry a strange woman; but this of itself
   is to be accounted among the gifts of God, that a king so powerful as
   the king of Egypt was, [169] sought his alliance. At the same time, as
   by the appointment of the Law, it was required that the Jews, previous
   to entering into the marriage relation, should endeavor to instruct
   their wives in the pure worship of God, and emancipate them from
   superstition; in the present instance, in which the wife spoken of was
   descended from a heathen nation, and who, by her present marriage, was
   included in the body of the Church, the prophet, in order to withdraw
   her from her evil training, exhorts her to forget her own country and
   her father's house, and to assume a new character and other manners. If
   she did not do this, there was reason to fear, not only that she would
   continue to observe in private the superstitions and false modes of
   worshipping God to which she had been habituated, but that also, by her
   public example, she would draw away many into a similar evil course;
   and, indeed, this actually came to pass soon after. Such is the reason
   of the exhortation which the prophet here gives her, in which, in order
   to render his discourse of more weight, he addresses her by the
   appellation of daughter, a term which it would have been unsuitable for
   any private man to have used. The more clearly to show how much it
   behoved the new bride to become altogether a new woman, he employs
   several terms thereby to secure her attention, Hearken, consider, and
   incline thy ear It is certainly a case in which much vehemence and
   urgent persuasion are needed, when it is intended to lead us to a
   complete renunciation of those things in which we take delight, either
   by nature or by custom. He then shows that there is no reason why the
   daughter of Pharaoh should feel any regret in forsaking her father, her
   kinsfolk, and the land of Egypt, because she would receive a glorious
   recompense, which ought to allay the grief she might experience in
   being separated from them. To reconcile her to the thought of leaving
   her own country, he encourages her by the consideration that she is
   married to so illustrious a king.

   Let us now return to Christ. And, in the first place, let us remember
   that what is spiritual is here described to us figuratively; even as
   the prophets, on account of the dulness of men, were under the
   necessity of borrowing similitudes from earthly things. When we bear in
   mind this style of speaking, which is quite common in the Scriptures,
   we will not think it strange that the sacred writer here makes mention
   of ivory palaces, gold, precious stones, and spices; for by these he
   means to intimate that the kingdom of Christ will be replenished with a
   rich abundance, and furnished with all good things. The glory and
   excellence of the spiritual gifts, with which God enriches his Church,
   are indeed held in no estimation among men; but in the sight of God
   they are of more value than all the riches of the world. At the same
   time, it is not necessary that we should apply curiously to Christ
   every particular here enumerated; [170] as for instance, what is here
   said of the many wives which Solomon had. If it should be imagined from
   this that there may be several churches, the unity of Christ's body
   will be rent in pieces. I admit, that as every individual believer is
   called "the temple of God," (1 Corinthians 3:17, and 6:19,) so also
   might each be named "the spouse of Christ;" but properly speaking,
   there is only one spouse of Christ, which consists of the whole body of
   the faithful. She is said to sit by the side of the king, not that she
   exercises any dominion peculiar to herself, but because Christ rules in
   her; and it is in this sense that she is called "the mother of us all,"
   (Galatians 4:26.)

   This passage contains a remarkable prophecy in reference to the future
   calling of the Gentiles, by which the Son of God formed an alliance
   with strangers and those who were his enemies. There was between God
   and the uncircumcised nations a deadly quarrel, a wall of separation
   which divided them from the seed of Abraham, the chosen people,
   (Ephesians 2:14;) for the covenant which God had made with Abraham shut
   out the Gentiles from the kingdom of heaven till the coming of Christ.
   Christ, therefore, of his free grace, desires to enter into a holy
   alliance of marriage with the whole world, in the same way as if a Jew
   in ancient times had taken to himself a wife from a foreign and heathen
   land. But in order to conduct into Christ's presence his bride chaste
   and undefiled, the prophet exhorts the Church gathered from the
   Gentiles to forget her former manner of living, and to devote herself
   wholly to her husband. As this change, by which the children of Adam
   begin to be the children of God, and are transformed into new men, is a
   thing so difficult, the prophet enforces the necessity of it the more
   earnestly. In enforcing his exhortation in this way by different terms,
   hearken, consider, incline thy ear, he intimates, that the faithful do
   not deny themselves, and lay aside their former habits, without intense
   and painful effort; for such an exhortation would be superfluous, were
   men naturally and voluntarily disposed to it. And, indeed, experience
   shows how dull and slow we are to follow God. By the word consider, or
   understand, our stupidity is tacitly rebuked, and not without good
   reason; for whence arise that self-love which is so blind, that false
   opinion which we have of our own wisdom and strength, the deception
   arising from the fascinations of the world, and, in fine, the arrogance
   and pride which are natural to us, but because we do not consider how
   precious a treasure God is presenting to us in his only begotten Son?
   Did not this ingratitude prevent us, we would without regret, after the
   example of Paul, (Philippians 3:8,) reckon as nothing, or as "dung,"
   those things which we admire most, that Christ might replenish us with
   his riches. By the word daughter, the prophet gently and sweetly
   soothes the new Church; and he also sets before her the promise of a
   bountiful reward, [171] to induce her, for the sake of Christ,
   willingly to despise and forsake whatever she made account of
   heretofore. It is certainly no small consolation to know that the Son
   of God will delight in us, when we shall have put off our earthly
   nature. In the meantime, let us learn, that to deny ourselves is the
   beginning of that sacred union which ought to exist between us and
   Christ. By her father's house and her people is doubtless meant all the
   corruptions which we carry with us from our mother's womb, or derive
   from evil custom; nay, under this mode of expression there is
   comprehended whatever men have belonging to themselves; for there is no
   part of our nature sound or free from corruption.

   It is necessary, also, to notice the reason which is added, namely,
   that if the Church refuses to devote herself wholly to Christ, she
   casts off his due and lawful authority. By the word worship we must
   understand not only the outward ceremony, but also, according to the
   figure synecdoche, a holy desire to yield reverence and obedience.
   Would to God that this admonition, as it ought, had been thoroughly
   weighed! for the Church of Christ had then been more obedient to his
   authority, and we should not in these days have had so great a contest
   to maintain in reference to her authority against the Papists, who
   imagine that the Church is not sufficiently exalted and honored, unless
   with unbridled license she may insolently triumph over her own husband.
   They, no doubt, in words ascribe supreme authority to Christ, saying,
   that every knee should bow before him; but when they maintain that the
   Church has an unlimited power of making laws, what else is this but to
   give her loose reins, and to exempt her from the authority of Christ,
   that she may break forth into any excess according to her desire? I
   stay not to notice how wickedly they arrogate to themselves the title
   and designation of the Church. But it is intolerable sacrilege to rob
   Christ and then adorn the Church with his spoils. It is no small
   dignity which the Church enjoys, in being seated at the right hand of
   the King, and it is no small honor to be called "the Mother" of all the
   godly, for to her it belongs to nourish and keep them under her
   discipline. But at the same time it is easy to gather from innumerable
   passages of Scripture, that Christ does not so elevate his own Church
   that he may diminish or impair in the least his own authority.

   12 And the daughter of Tyre with a gift. This also is a part of the
   recompense which the prophet promises to the queen in order to mitigate
   or rather to extinguish entirely, the longing desire she might still
   feel after her former condition. He says: that the Tyrians will come
   humbly to pay her reverence, bringing presents with them. Tyre, we
   know, was formerly a city of great renown, and, therefore, he accounts
   it a very high honor that men will come from a city so distinguished
   and opulent to greet her and to testify their submission to her. It is
   not necessary for us to examine every word minutely, in order to apply
   to the Church every thing here said concerning the wife of Solomon; but
   in our own day we realize some happy fruits of this prophecy when God
   has so ordered it, that some of the great men of this world, although
   they themselves refuse to submit to the authority of Christ, act with
   kindness towards the Church, maintaining and defending her.

   suppose that the relative 'sr, asher, which, a pronoun frequently
   omitted, is to be understood, -- "out of which palaces they have made
   thee glad." This is the view taken by many interpreters. Others
   understand the word mny, minni, to be a noun; (and from Jeremiah 51:27,
   it appears that mny, minni, was the proper name of a territory, which
   Bochart shows was a district of Armenia;) and they translate the words
   thus, "From the ivory palaces of Armenia they make thee glad," make
   thee glad with presents. Others suppose that mny, minni, is here the
   name of a region, Minnaea in Arabia Felix, which abounded in myrrh and
   frankincense; and according to this view, the clause may be rendered,
   "The Minnaeitas from their ivory palaces make thee glad;" that is,
   coming to thee from their ivory palaces they gladden thee with
   presents. Rosenmüller thinks with Schmidt, De Wette, and Gesenius, that
   a more elegant sense will be brought out if we understand mny, minni,
   as a plural noun in a form somewhat unusual, but of which there are
   several other examples in the Old Testament, such as sksy, 2 Samuel

   signifies, as in the Syriac, Psalm 150:4, chords, stringed instruments
   of music. The sense of the clause will thus be, From the palaces of
   ivory, musical instruments -- players on musical instruments -- make

   illustrate. The interpreter who allows his ingenuity to press too
   closely all the points of the allegory to the spiritual subjects
   couched under it, seeking points of comparison in the complementary
   parts, which are introduced merely for the purpose of giving more
   animation and beauty to the discourse, is in danger by his fanciful

   Psalm 45:13-17

   13. The daughter of the King is all glorious within: her clothing is of
   garments embroidered with gold. 14. She shall be brought to the King in
   raiment of needle-work: the virgins after her, her companions, shall be
   brought to thee. 15. They shall be brought with joy and gladness; they
   shall enter into the palace of the King. 16. Instead of thy fathers
   shall be thy children: thou shalt make them princes in all the earth.
   17. I will make thy name to be remembered throughout all generations:
   therefore the people shall praise thee for ever and ever.


   13 The daughter of the King is all glorious within [172] This verse may
   be understood in a twofold sense; either as meaning that the queen, not
   only when she appears in public before all the people, but also when
   sitting in private in her own chamber, is always sumptuously
   apparelled; or, that the splendor and gorgeous appearance of her attire
   is not merely a thing of display, designed to dazzle the eyes of the
   simple, but consists of expensive and really substantial material. The
   prophet accordingly enhances the happy and lofty condition of the queen
   by the circumstance, that she has not only sumptuous apparel in which
   she may appear on particular occasions, but also for her ordinary and
   daily attire. Others expound it in this sense, That all her glory
   consists in the king inviting her familiarity into his presence; and
   this opinion they rest on the ground that immediately after there is a
   description given of her as passing into the chamber of the king
   accompanied with a great and glorious train of followers. This display
   of pomp exceeds the bounds of due moderation; but, in the meantime, we
   are taught by it, that while the Church is thus richly apparelled, it
   is not designed to attract the notice of men, but only for the pleasure
   of the King. If in our day the Church is not so richly adorned with
   that spiritual beauty in which the glory of Christ shines forth, the
   fault ought to be imputed to the ingratitude of men, who either through
   their own indifference despise the goodness of God, or else, after
   having been enriched by him, again fall into a state of poverty and
   want.

   16 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children This also serves to
   show the glory and transcendent excellence of this kingdom, namely,
   that the children will not be inferior in dignity to their fathers, and
   that the nobility of the race will not be diminished after the death of
   Solomon; for the children which shall be born to him will equal those
   who had preceded them in the most excellent virtues. Then it is added,
   that they shall be princes in all the earth, because the empire shall
   enjoy such an extent of dominion on every side, that it might easily be
   divided into many kingdoms. It is easy to gather, that this prophecy is
   spoken expressly concerning Christ; for so far were the sons of Solomon
   from having a kingdom of such an extent, as to divide it into provinces
   among them, that his first successor retained only a small portion of
   his kingdom. There were none of his true and lawful successors who
   attained the same power which he had enjoyed, but being princes only
   over one tribe and a half of the people, they were, on this account,
   shut up within narrow limits, and, as we say, had their wings clipped.
   [173] But at the coming of Christ, who appeared at the close of the
   ancient Church, and the beginning of the new dispensation, it is an
   undoubted truth, that children were begotten by him, who were inferior
   in no respect to their fathers, either in number or in excellence, and
   whom he set as rulers over the whole world. In the estimation of the
   world, the ignominy of the cross obscures the glory of the Church; but
   when we consider how wonderfully it has increased, and how much it has
   been distinguished by spiritual gifts, we must confess that it is not
   without cause that her glory is in this passage celebrated in such
   sublime language. It ought, however, to be observed, that the
   sovereignty, of which mention is here made, consists not in the persons
   of men, but refers to the head. According to a frequent mode of
   expression in the Word of God, the dominion and power which belong
   properly to the head, and are applicable peculiarly to Christ alone,
   are in many places ascribed to his members. We know that those who
   occupy eminent stations in the Church, and who rule in the name of
   Christ, do not exercise a lordly dominion, but rather act as servants.
   As, however, Christ has committed to them his Gospel, which is the
   scepter of his kingdom, and intrusted it as it were to their keeping,
   they exercise, in some sort, his power. And, indeed, Christ, by his
   ministers, has subdued to his dominion the whole world, and has erected
   as many principalities under his authority as there have been churches
   gathered to him in divers nations by their preaching.

   17 I will make thy name to be remembered, etc. This also is equally
   inapplicable to Solomon, who, by his shameful and impious rebellion,
   stained the memory of his name with disgrace. In polluting by
   superstitious abominations the land which was consecrated to God, did
   he not bring upon himself indelible ignominy and shame? For this deed
   alone his name deserves to be buried in everlasting oblivion. Nor was
   his son Rehoboam in any degree more deserving of praise; for through
   his own foolish presumption he lost the better part of his kingdom. To
   find, therefore, the true accomplishment of what is here said, we must
   come to Christ, the memory of whose name continues to prosper and
   prevail. It is no doubt despised by the world, nay, wicked men, in the
   pride of their hearts, even reproach his sacred name, and outrageously
   trample it under their feet; but still it survives in its undiminished
   majesty. It is also true, that his enemies rise up on all sides in vast
   numbers to overthrow his kingdom; but notwithstanding, men are already
   beginning to bow the knee before him, which they will continue to do,
   until the period arrive when he shall tread down all the powers that
   are opposed to him. The furious efforts of Satan and the whole world
   have not been able to extinguish the name of Christ, which, being
   transmitted from one generation to another, still retains its glory in
   every age, even as at this day we see it celebrated in every language.
   And although the greater part of the world tear it in pieces by their
   impious blasphemies, yet it is enough that God stirs up his servants
   every where to proclaim with fidelity and with unfeigned zeal the
   praises of Christ. In the meantime, it is our duty diligently to use
   our endeavors, that the memory of Christ, which ought to prosper and
   prevail throughout all ages, to the eternal salvation of men, may never
   at any time lose any of its renown.

   rendered within denotes the interior of a house in Leviticus 10:18, and
   1 Kings 6:18. Fry explains the words thus: "Most splendid is the royal
   daughter within the awning of her covered vehicle;" and refers to the
   picture of a bridal procession in Mr Lane's Egypt. Dr Geddes reads: --
   "All glorious is the queen in her apartment,

   To the king she shall be brought in brocade,
   Attended by her virgin companions." "This," says he, namely, verse
   13th, "and the two next verses, contain a fine description of Oriental

   gorgeously dressed in her own; and thence proceeds with her female

   PSALM 46

   This psalm seems to be an expression of thanksgiving rather for some
   particular deliverance, than for the constant aid by which God has
   always protected and preserved his Church. It may be inferred from it
   that the city of Jerusalem. when stricken with great terror, and placed
   in extreme danger, was preserved, contrary to all expectation, by the
   unlooked for and miraculous power of God. The prophet, therefore,
   whoever composed the psalm, commending a deliverance so singularly
   vouchsafed by God, exhorts the faithful to commit themselves
   confidently to his protection, and not to doubt that, relying
   fearlessly upon him as their guardian and the protector of their
   welfare, they shall be continually preserved in safety from all the
   assaults of their enemies, because it is his peculiar office to quell
   all commotions.

   To the chief musician of the sons of Korah, a song upon Alamoth.

   Interpreters are not agreed as to the meaning of the word lmvt,
   alamoth; but without noticing all the different opinions, I shall
   mention only two of them, namely, that it was either an instrument of
   music, or else the commencement of some common and well known song. The
   latter conjecture appears to me the most probable. As to the time when
   this psalm was written it is also uncertain, unless, perhaps, we might
   suppose that it was written when the siege of the city was suddenly
   raised by the terrible and sore destruction which God brought upon the
   army of Sennacherib, [174] (2 Kings 19:35.) This opinion I readily
   admit, because it accords most with the whole scope of the psalm. It is
   abundantly manifest that some favor of God, worthy of being held in
   remembrance, such as that was, is here commended.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 46:1-2

   1. God is our refuge and strength: he is found an exceeding [or
   superlative] help in tribulations. 2. Therefore we will not fear,
   though the earth be moved, and the mountains fall into the midst of the
   sea.


   1. God is our refuge and strength Here the Psalmist begins with a
   general expression or sentiment, before he comes to speak of the more
   particular deliverance. He begins by premising that God is sufficiently
   able to protect his own people, and that he gives them sufficient
   ground to expect it; for this the word mchsh, machaseh, properly
   signifies. In the second clause of the verse the verb he is found,
   which we translate in the present, is in the past tense, he has been
   found; and, indeed, there would be no impropriety in limiting the
   language to some particular deliverance which had already been
   experienced, just as others also have rendered it in the past tense.
   But as the prophet adds the term tribulations in the plural number, I
   prefer explaining it of a continued act, That God comes seasonably to
   our aid, and is never wanting in the time of need, as often as any
   afflictions press upon his people. If the prophet were speaking of the
   experience of God's favor, it would answer much better to render the
   verb in the past tense. It is, however, obvious that his design is to
   extol the power of God and his goodness towards his people, and to show
   how ready God is to afford them assistance, that they may not in the
   time of their adversities gaze around them on every side, but rest
   satisfied with his protection alone. He therefore says expressly that
   God acts in such a manner towards them, to let the Church know that he
   exercises a special care in preserving and defending her. There can be
   no doubt that by this expression he means to draw a distinction between
   the chosen people of God and other heathen nations, and in this way to
   commend the privilege of adoption which God of his goodness had
   vouchsafed to the posterity of Abraham. Accordingly, when I said before
   that it was a general expression, my intention was not to extend it to
   all manner of persons, but only to all times; for the object of the
   prophet is to teach us after what manner God is wont to act towards
   those who are his people. He next concludes, by way of inference, that
   the faithful nave no reason to be afraid, since God is always ready to
   deliver them, nay, is also armed with invincible power. He shows in
   this that the true and proper proof of our hope consists in this, that,
   when things are so confused, that the heavens seem as it were to fall
   with great violence, the earth to remove out of its place, and the
   mountains to be torn up from their very foundations, we nevertheless
   continue to preserve and maintain calmness and tranquillity of heart.
   It is an easy matter to manifest the appearance of great confidence, so
   long as we are not placed in imminent danger: but if, in the midst of a
   general crash of the whole world, our minds continue undisturbed and
   free of trouble, this is an evident proof that we attribute to the
   power of God the honor which belongs to him. When, however, the sacred
   poet says, We will not fear, he is not to be understood as meaning that
   the minds of the godly are exempt from all solicitude or fear, as if
   they were destitute of feeling, for there is a great difference between
   insensibility and the confidence of faith. He only shows that whatever
   may happen they are never overwhelmed with terror, but rather gather
   strength and courage sufficient to allay all fear. Though the earth be
   moved, and the mountains fall into the midst of the sea, are
   hyperbolical modes of expression, but they nevertheless denote a
   revolution, and turning upside down of the whole world. Some have
   explained the expression, the midst of the sea, as referring to the
   earth. I do not, however, approve of it. But in order more fully to
   understand the doctrine of the psalm, let us proceed to consider what
   follows.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 46:3-5

   3. Though the waters thereof roar and rage [175] tempestuously: though
   the mountains be shaken with the swelling thereof. Selah. 4. The
   streams of her river shall make glad the city of God, the sanctuary of
   the tabernacles of the Most High. 5. God is in the midst of her; she
   shall not be moved: God will help her at the dawn of the morning.


   3 Though the waters thereof roar, etc This verse ought to be read in
   connection with the verse which follows, because it is necessary to
   complete the sense, as if it had been said: Though the waters of the
   sea roar and swell, and by their fierce impetuosity shake the very
   mountains -- even in the midst of these dreadful tumults, the holy city
   of God will continue to enjoy comfort and peace, satisfied with her
   small streams. The relative pronoun her, according to the common usage
   of the Hebrew language, is superfluous in this place. The prophet
   intended simply to say, that the small streams of a river would afford
   to the holy city abundant cause of rejoicing, though the whole world
   should be moved and destroyed. I have already mentioned shortly before
   how profitable is the doctrine taught us in this place, that our faith
   is really and truly tested only when we are brought into very severe
   conflicts, and when even hell itself seems opened to swallow us up. In
   like manner, we have portrayed to us the victory of faith over the
   whole world, when, in the midst of the utmost confusion, it unfolds
   itself, and begins to raise its head in such a manner as that although
   the whole creation seem to be banded together, and to have conspired
   for the destruction of the faithful, it nevertheless triumphs over all
   fear. Not that the children of God, when placed in peril, indulge in
   jesting or make a sport of death, but the help which God has promised
   them more than overbalances, in their estimation, all the evils which
   inspire them with fear. The sentiment of Horace is very beautiful,
   when, speaking of the righteous man and the man who feels conscious of
   no guilt, he says, (Car., Lib. iii., Od. 3,)

   "Dux inquieti turbidus Adriae,
   Nec fulminantis magna Jovis manus,
   Si fractus illabitur orbis,
   Impavidum ferient ruinae."

   "Let the wild winds that rule the seas,
   Tempestuous, all their horrors raise;
   Let Jove's dread arm with thunders rend the spheres;
   Beneath the crush of worlds undaunted he appears." [176]

   But as no such person as he imagines could ever be found, he only
   trifles in speaking as he does. Their fortitude, therefore, has its
   foundation in the assurance of the divine protection alone, so that
   they who rely upon God, and put their trust in him, may truly boast,
   not only that they shall be undismayed, but also that they shall be
   preserved in security and safety amidst the ruins of a falling world.

   The prophet says expressly, that the city of God shall be glad,
   although it had no raging sea, but only a gently flowing stream, to set
   for its defense against those waves of which he has made mention. By
   this mode of expression he alludes to the stream which flowed from
   Shiloah, and passed through the city of Jerusalem. Further, the
   prophet, I have no doubt, here indirectly rebukes the vain confidence
   of those who, fortified by earthly assistance, imagine that they are
   well protected, and beyond the reach of all danger. Those who anxiously
   seek to strengthen themselves on all sides with the invincible helps of
   the world, seem, indeed, to imagine that they are able to prevent their
   enemies from approaching them, just as if they were environed on all
   sides with the sea; but it often happens that the very defenses which
   they had reared turn to their own destruction, even as when a tempest
   lays waste and destroys an island by overflowing it. But they who
   commit themselves to the protection of God, although in the estimation
   of the world they are exposed to every kind of injury, and are not
   sufficiently able to repel the assaults made upon them, nevertheless
   repose in security. On this account, Isaiah (Isaiah 8:6) reproves the
   Jews because they despised the gently flowing waters of Shiloah, and
   longed for deep and rapid rivers.

   In that passage, there is an elegant antithesis between the little
   brook Shiloah on the one hand, and the Nile and Euphrates on the other;
   as if he had said, They defraud God of his honor by the unworthy
   reflection, that when he made choice of the city of Jerusalem, he had
   not made the necessary provision in respect of strength and
   fortifications for its defense and preservation. And certainly, if this
   psalm was written after the slaughter and flight of the army of
   Sennacherib, it is probable that the inspired writer purposely made use
   of the same metaphor, to teach the faithful in all ages, that the grace
   of God alone would be to them a sufficient protection, independent of
   the assistance of the world. In like manner, the Holy Spirit still
   exhorts and encourages us to cherish the same confidence, that,
   despising all the resources of those who proudly magnify themselves
   against us, we may preserve our tranquillity in the midst of
   disquietude and trouble, and not be grieved or ashamed on account of
   our defenseless condition, so long as the hand of God is stretched out
   to save us. Thus, although the help of God comes to our aid in a secret
   and gentle manner, like the still flowing streams, yet it imparts to us
   more tranquillity of mind than if the whole power of the world were
   gathered together for our help. In speaking of Jerusalem as the
   sanctuary of the tabernacles of the Most High, the prophet makes a
   beautiful allusion to the circumstances or condition of that time: for
   although God exercised authority over all the tribes of the people, yet
   he made choice of that city as the seat of royalty, from which he might
   govern the whole nation of Israel. The tabernacles of the Most High
   were scattered throughout all Judea, but still it was necessary that
   they should be gathered together and united in one sanctuary, that they
   might be under the dominion of God.

   5. God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved. The Psalmist now
   shows that the great security of the Church consists in this, that God
   dwells in the midst of her; for the verb which we translate, shall be
   moved, is of the feminine gender, nor can it be referred to God, as if
   it were designed to teach that God is immovable. The sentence must be
   explained in this way, The holy city shall not be moved or shaken,
   because God dwells there, and is always ready to help her. The
   expression, the dawn of the morning [177] denotes daily, as soon as the
   sun rises upon the earth. The sum of the whole is, If we desire to be
   protected by the hand of God, we must be concerned above all things
   that he may dwell amongst us; for all hope of safety depends upon his
   presence alone. And he dwells amongst us for no other purpose than to
   preserve us uninjured. Moreover, although God does not always hasten
   immediately to our aid, according to the importunity of our desires,
   yet he will always come to us seasonably, so as to make apparent the
   truth of what is elsewhere said,

   "Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep,"
   (Psalm 121:4.)

   Psalm 46:6-11

   6. The peoples raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice
   [178] the earth melted. 7. Jehovah of armies is with us: the God of
   Jacob is our fortress. Selah. 8. Come ye, consider the works of
   Jehovah, what desolations [179] he hath made in the earth. 9. He maketh
   battles to cease even to the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, he
   cutteth in pieces the spear; he burneth the chariots with fire. [180]
   10. Be still [181] and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the
   heathen, I will be exalted in the earth [182] 11. Jehovah of armies is
   with us: the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah.


   6 The peoples raged Since the Church of God is never without enemies,
   and these very powerful, and such as consequently fight against her
   with cruel and unbridled fury, the prophet now confirms from experience
   the doctrine which he had advanced concerning the impregnable character
   of the divine protection. He then deduces from it this general ground
   of consolation, That it belongs continually to God to restrain and
   quell all commotions, and that his arm is strong enough to break all
   the efforts of the enemy. This passage, I admit, might be understood in
   a more general sense, as meaning that the city of God is liable to be
   assailed by many storms and tempests; but that by the favor of God she
   is, nevertheless, always preserved in safety. It is, however, more
   probable, as I have already said at the beginning, that the Psalmist is
   here speaking of some notable deliverance, in which God had given a
   striking proof of the power and favor which he exercises in the
   constant preservation of the Church. Accordingly, he relates what had
   taken place, namely, that the enemies of the Church came with a
   dreadful host to waste and destroy it; but that immediately, by the
   voice of God, they, as it were, melted and vanished away. From this we
   derive an invaluable ground of consolation, when it is said, That
   although the whole world rise up against us, and confound all things by
   their increased madness, they can be brought to nought in a moment, as
   soon as God shows himself favorable towards us. The voice of God, no
   doubt, signifies his will or command; but the prophet, by this
   expression, seems to have an eye to the promises of God, by which he
   has declared, that he will be the guardian and defender of the Church.
   At the same time, let us observe the contrast which is here stated
   between the voice of God and the turbulent commotions of the kingdoms
   of this world.

   7. Jehovah of armies is with us. In this verse we are taught how we
   shall be able to apply to our own use the things which the Scriptures
   everywhere record concerning the infinite power of God. We shall be
   able to do this when we believe ourselves to be of the number of those
   whom God has embraced with his fatherly love, and whom he will cherish.
   The Psalmist again alludes, in terms of commendation, to the adoption
   by which Israel was separated from the common condition of all the
   other nations of the earth. And, indeed, apart from this, the
   description of the power of God would only inspire us with dread.
   Confident boasting, then, arises from this, that God has chosen us for
   his peculiar people, to show forth his power in preserving and
   defending us. On this account, the prophet, after having celebrated the
   power of God by calling him the God of armies, immediately adds another
   epithet, the God of Jacob, by which he confirms the covenant made of
   old time with Abraham, that his posterity, to whom the inheritance of
   the promised grace belongs, should not doubt that God was favorable to
   them also. That our faith may rest truly and firmly in God, we must
   take into consideration at the same time these two parts of his
   character -- his immeasurable power, by which he is able to subdue the
   whole world under him; and his fatherly love which he has manifested in
   his word. When these two things are joined together, there is nothing
   which can hinder our faith from defying all the enemies which may rise
   up against us, nor must we doubt that God will succor us, since he has
   promised to do it; and as to power, he is sufficiently able also to
   fulfill his promise, for he is the God of armies. From this we learn,
   that those persons err egregiously in the interpretation of Scripture,
   who leave in entire suspense the application of all that is said
   concerning the power of God, and do not rest assured that he will be a
   Father to them, inasmuch as they are of his flock, and partakers of the
   adoption.

   8 Come ye, consider the works of Jehovah The Psalmist seems still to
   continue in this verse the history of a deliverance by which God had
   given abundant evidence that he is the most efficient and faithful
   protector of his Church, that the godly might derive from it both
   courage and strength to enable them to overcome whatever temptations
   might afterwards arise. The manifestations which God has given of his
   favor towards us in preserving us, ought to be kept continually before
   our eyes as a means of establishing in our hearts a persuasion of the
   stability of his promises. By this exhortation we have tacitly rebuked
   the indifference and stupidity of those who do not make so great
   account of the power of God as they ought to do; or rather, the whole
   world is charged with ingratitude, because there is scarcely one in a
   hundred who acknowledges that he has abundant help and security in God,
   so that they are all blinded to the works of God, or rather wilfully
   shut their eyes at that which would, nevertheless, prove the best means
   of strengthening their faith. We see how many ascribe to fortune that
   which ought to be traced to the providence of God. Others imagine that
   they obtain, by their own industry, whatever God has bestowed upon
   them, or ascribe to second causes what proceeds from him alone; while
   others are utterly lost to all sense. The Psalmist, therefore, justly
   calls upon all men, and exhorts them to consider the works of God; as
   if he had said, The reason why men repose not the hope of their welfare
   in God is, that they are indifferent to the consideration of his works,
   or so ungrateful, that they make not half the account of them which
   they ought to do. As he addresses himself in general to all men, we
   learn, that even the godly themselves are drowsy and unconcerned in
   this respect until they are awakened. He extols very highly the power
   of God in preserving his chosen people, which is commonly despised or
   not estimated as it ought to be, when it is exercised after an ordinary
   manner. He therefore sets before them the desolations of countries, and
   marvellous devastations, and other miraculous things, which more
   powerfully move the minds of men. If any one would prefer to understand
   what follows -- He maketh battles to cease -- of some special help
   vouchsafed by God, yet still it must be considered as intended to lead
   the faithful to expect as much help from him in future as they had
   already experienced. The prophet, it appears, from one particular
   instance, designs to show in general how mightily God is wont to defend
   his Church. At the same time, it happened more than once, that God
   quelled throughout the land of Judea all the dangerous tumults by which
   it was distracted, and drove away wars far from it, by depriving the
   enemies of their courage, breaking their bows, and burning their
   chariots; and it is very probable that the prophet, froth a particular
   instance, here takes occasion to remind the Jews how often God had
   disappointed the greatest efforts of their enemies. One thing, however,
   is quite certain, that God is here set forth as adorned with these
   titles, that we should look for peace from him, even when the whole
   world is in uproar, and agitated in a dreadful manner.

   10 Be still, and know that I am God The Psalmist seems now to turn his
   discourse to the enemies of the people of God, who indulge their lust
   of mischief and revenge upon them: for in doing injury to the saints
   they do not consider that they are making war against God. Imagining
   that they have only to do with men, they presumptuously assail them,
   and therefore the prophet here represses their insolence; and that his
   address may have the more weight, he introduces God himself as speaking
   to them. In the first place, he bids them be still, that they may know
   that he is God; for we see that when men are carried away without
   consideration, they go beyond all bounds and measure. Accordingly, the
   prophet justly requires the enemies of the Church to be still and hold
   their peace, so that when their anger is appeased they may perceive
   that they are fighting against God. We have in the fourth Psalm, at the
   fourth verse, a sentiment somewhat similar, "Stand in awe, and sin not:
   commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still." In short, the
   Psalmist exhorts the world to subdue and restrain their turbulent
   affections, and to yield to the God of Israel the glory which he
   deserves; and he warns them, that if they proceed to act like madmen,
   his power is not enclosed within the narrow limits of Judea, and that
   it will be no difficult matter for him to stretch forth his arm afar to
   the Gentiles and heathen nations, that he may glorify himself in every
   land. In conclusion, he repeats what he had already said, that God has
   more than enough, both of weapons and of strength, to preserve and
   defend his Church which he has adopted.

   [180] There is probably here an allusion to the ancient custom of

   Jews, and the first instance of it which we meet with is in Joshua

   upon Gog, Ezekiel 39:8-10. This was also a Roman custom. Virgil alludes
   to it in Aeneid, lib. 8, 50, 560. A medal struck by Vespasian the Roman

   through all parts of the world, represents the Goddess of Peace holding

   [174] Others refer it, as Rosenmüller, to the victory of Jehoshaphat,
   which was celebrated with great rejoicing, 2 Chronicles 20:26-30. It
   is, however, difficult or impossible to ascertain with certainty the
   occasion on which it was composed. It seems rather the language of
   faith under threatened difficulties, than of triumph over vanquished
   foes. Thus, in the midst of threatened danger, it may be employed by
   Christians to support their faith, hope, and peace. This was Luther's
   favorite psalm. He composed a famous version of it on his journey to
   the Diet at Worms, where he went boldly to defend the Reformation at
   the risk of his life; and he was wont to say when threatened with any
   fresh trouble, "Come, let us sing the 46th Psalm."

   PSALM 47

   Some think that this psalm was composed at the time when the temple was
   dedicated, and the ark of the covenant placed in the sanctuary. But as
   this is a conjecture which has little to support it, it is better, if I
   am not mistaken, instead of detaining ourselves with this, to consider
   the subject-matter of the psalm, and the use to which it ought
   especially to be applied. It was no doubt appointed for the stated holy
   assemblies, as may be easily gathered from the whole tenor of the poem;
   and perhaps it was composed by David, and delivered by him to the
   Levites, to be sung by them before the temple was built, and when the
   ark as yet abode in the tabernacle. But whoever was its author, he
   exhorts not only the Israelites, but also all nations, to worship the
   only true God. It chiefly magnifies the favor which, according to the
   state of things at that time, God had graciously vouchsafed to the
   offspring of Abraham; and salvation to the whole world was to proceed
   from this source. It however contains, at the same time, a prophecy of
   the future kingdom of Christ. It teaches that the glory which then
   shone under the figure of the material sanctuary will diffuse its
   splendor far and wide; when God himself will cause the beams of his
   grace to shine into distant lands, that kings and nations may be united
   into fellowship with the children of Abraham.

   Psalm 47:1-4

   1. Clap your hands, all ye peoples: shout unto God with the voice of
   triumph. 2. For Jehovah is high, terrible, and a great King over all
   the earth. 3. He hath put in order [183] the people under us, and the
   nations under our feet. 4. He hath chosen our inheritance for us, the
   glory of Jacob, whom he loved. Selah.


   1. Clap your hands, all ye peoples As the Psalmist requires the
   nations, in token of their joy and of their thanksgiving; to God, to
   clap their hands, or rather exhorts them to a more than ordinary joy,
   the vehemence of which breaks forth and manifests itself by external
   expressions, it is certain that he is here speaking of the deliverance
   which God had wrought for them. Had God erected among the Gentiles some
   formidable kingdom, this would rather have deprived all of their
   courage, and overwhelmed them with despair, than given them matter to
   sing and leap for joy. Besides, the inspired writer does not here treat
   of some common or ordinary blessings of God; but of such blessings as
   will fill the whole world with incredible joy, and stir up the minds of
   all men to celebrate the praises of God. What he adds a little after,
   that all nations were brought into subjection to Israel, must,
   therefore, necessarily be understood not of slavish subjection, but of
   a subjection which is more excellent, and more to be desired, than all
   the kingdoms of the world. It would be unnatural for those who are
   subdued and brought to submit by force and fear to leap for joy. Many
   nations were tributary to David, and to his son Solomon; but while they
   were so, they ceased not, at the same time, to murmur, and bore
   impatiently the yoke which was imposed upon them, so far were they from
   giving thanks to God with joyful and cheerful hearts.

   Since, then, no servitude is happy and desirable but that by which God
   subdues and brings under the standard and authority of Christ his Son
   those who before were rebels, it follows that this language is
   applicable only to the kingdom of Christ, who is called a high and
   terrible King, (verse 2;) not that he makes the wretched beings over
   whom he reigns to tremble by the tyranny and violence of his sway, but
   because his majesty, which before had been held in contempt, will
   suffice to quell the rebellion of the whole world. It is to be
   observed, that the design of the Holy Spirit is here to teach, that as
   the Jews had been long contumeliously treated, oppressed with wrongs,
   and afflicted from time to time with divers calamities, the goodness
   and liberality of God towards them was now so much the more
   illustrious, when the kingdom of David had subdued the neighboring
   nations on every sidle, and had attained to such a height of glory. We
   may, however, easily gather from the connection of the words the truth
   of what I have suggested, that when God is called a terrible and great
   King over all the earth, this prophecy applies to the kingdom of
   Christ. There is, therefore, no doubt, that the grace of God was
   celebrated by these titles, to strengthen the hearts of the godly
   during the period that intervened till the advent of Christ, in which
   not only the triumphant state of the people of Israel had fallen into
   decay, but in which also the people, being oppressed with the bitterest
   contumely, could have no taste of the favor of God, and no consolation
   from it, but by relying on the promises of God alone. We know that
   there was a long interruption of the splendor of the kingdom of God's
   ancient people, which continued from the death of Solomon to the coming
   of Christ. This interval formed, as it were, a gulf or chasm, which
   would have swallowed up the minds of the godly, had they not been
   supported and upheld by the Word of God. As, therefore, God exhibited
   in the person of David a type of the kingdom of Christ, which is here
   extolled, although there followed shortly after a sad and almost
   shameful diminution of the glory of David's kingdom, then the most
   grievous calamities, and, finally, the captivity and a most miserable
   dispersion, which differed little from a total destruction, the Holy
   Spirit has exhorted the faithful to continue clapping their hands for
   joy, until the advent of the promised Redeemer.

   3. He hath set in order the people under us Some translate the verb he
   hath subjected; and this agrees with the translation which I have
   given. Others translate it he hath led, which is somewhat more remote
   from the meaning. But to understand the verb ydvr, yadebber, as meaning
   to destroy, as is done by others, is altogether at variance with the
   mind of the prophet; for it is doubtless an advantageous, joyful, and
   desirable subjection which is here meant. In the Hebrew, the verb is in
   the future tense, he will set in order; and if any are disposed to
   prefer retaining it in this tense, I have no great objection to it. As,
   however, it is certain that under the figure of the kingdom of David
   there is here celebrated the grace of God to come, I have readily
   adopted that rendering which has been preferred by other interpreters.
   Besides, although in this verse the prophet especially exhorts his own
   countrymen to gratitude to God, because, through his favor, they ruled
   over all people; yet it is certain that he means, that those also who
   were subdued are associated with the Jews in this joy. The body does
   not differ more from the shadow than the reigned expressions of joy
   with which the heathen nations honored David in old time, differ from
   those with which the faithful through the whole world [184] receive
   Christ,; for the latter flow from the willing obedience of the heart.
   And assuredly, if after the ark was brought to the temple, there had
   not appeared hidden under this figure something far higher, which
   formed the substance of it:, it would have been as it were a childish
   joy to assign to God his dwelling there, and to shut him up within such
   narrow limits. But when the majesty of God which had dwelt in the
   tabernacle was manifested to the whole world, and when all nations were
   brought in subjection to his authority, this prerogative of the
   offspring of Abraham was then illustriously manifested. The prophet,
   then, when he declares that the Gentiles Will be subdued, so that they
   will not refuse to obey the chosen people, is describing that kingdom
   of which he had previously spoken. We are not to suppose that he here
   treats of that secret providence by which God governs the whole world,
   but of the special power which he exercises by means of his word; and,
   therefore, in order that he may be properly called a King, his own
   people must necessarily acknowledge him as such. It may, however, be
   asked, "Since Christ has brought the Church under his own authority and
   celestial power, in what sense can it be said that the nations are
   subject to the Jews, seeing we know that the order of the Church cannot
   be settled aright, and as it ought to be, unless Christ the only head
   stand forth prominently above all, and all the faithful, from the
   greatest to the least, keep themselves in the humble rank of members?
   Nay, more, when Christ erected his dominion through the whole world,
   the adoption, which had before been the peculiar privilege of one
   people, began to be the common privilege of all nations; and by this
   means liberty was granted to all together, that being united to one
   another by the ties of true brotherhood, they should aspire to the
   celestial inheritance." The answer to this is easy: When the yoke of
   the law, [185] was imposed upon the Gentiles, the Jews then obtained
   the sovereignty over them; even as by the word the pastors of the
   Church exercise the jurisdiction of the Holy Spirit. For this very
   reason the Church is called a Queen, and the Mother of all the godly,
   (Galatians 4:26,) because divine truth, which is like a scepter to
   subdue us all, has been committed to her keeping. Although then the
   Jews, when the kingdom of Christ emerged into light, were in a state of
   wretched and ignominious servitude to heathen nations, and had been, as
   it were, their slaves; yet the sovereignty is truly and justly
   attributed to them, because God "sent the rod of his strength out of
   Zion," (Psalm 110:2;) and as they were intrusted with the keeping of
   the la their office was to restrain and subdue the Gentiles by its
   authority. The only way by which the rest of the world has been brought
   into subjection to God is, that men, being renewed by the Spirit of
   God, have willingly yielded themselves docile and tractable to the
   Jews, and suffered themselves to be under their dominion; as it is said
   in another passage,

   "In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold out
   of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of
   him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you;for we have heard that
   God is with you," (Zechariah 8:23.)

   4. He hath chosen our inheritance for us. The inspired poet here
   celebrates more distinctly the special grace which God, in his
   goodness, had bestowed upon the chosen and holy seed of Abraham. As he
   passed by all the rest of the word, and adopted to himself a people who
   were few in number and contemptible; so it was proper that such a
   signal pledge of his fatherly love should be distinguished from his
   common beneficence, which is extended to all mankind without
   distinction. The word chosen is therefore peculiarly emphatic, implying
   that God had not dealt with the children of Abraham as he had been
   accustomed indiscriminately to deal with other nations; but that he had
   bestowed upon them, as it were by hereditary right, a peculiar dignity
   by which they excelled all others. The same thing is expressed
   immediately after by the word glory Thus then the prophet enjoins the
   duty of thanksgiving to God, for having exalted, in the person of
   Jacob, his chosen people to the highest degree of honor, so that they
   might boast that their condition was distinguished from that of all
   other nations. He shows, at the same time, that this was entirely owing
   to the free and unmerited favor of God. The relative pronoun whom is
   put instead of the causal particle for or because, as if the Psalmist
   had attributed the cause of this prerogative by which they were
   distinguished to God himself. Whenever the favor of God towards the
   Jews is commended, in consequence of his having loved their fathers,
   this principle should always be kept in mind, that hereby all merits in
   man are annihilated. If all the excellence or glory of the holy
   patriarch depended purely and simply upon the good pleasure of God, who
   can dare to arrogate any thing to himself as peculiarly his own? If God
   then has given us any thing above others, and as it were by special
   privilege, let us learn to ascribe the whole to the fatherly love which
   he bears towards seeing he has chosen us to be his flock. We also
   gather from this passage that the grace which God displays towards his
   chosen is not extended to all men in common, but is a privilege by
   which he distinguishes a few from the great mass of mankind.

   Psalm 47:5-9

   5. God is gone up with triumph, Jehovah with the sound of a trumpet. 6.
   Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises to our King, sing
   praises. 7. For God is King of all the earth: sing praises every one
   who understandeth. 8. He hath obtained the kingdom over the heathen:
   God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness. 9. The princes of the
   peoples [or nations] are assembled together to the people of the God of
   Abraham: for the shields of the earth are God's: he is greatly exalted.


   5. God is gone up with triumph There is here an allusion to the ancient
   ceremony which was observed under the Law. As the sound of trumpets was
   wont to be used in solemnising the holy assemblies, the prophet says
   that God goes up, when the trumpets encourage and stir up the people to
   magnify and extol his power. When this ceremony was performed in old
   time, it was just as if a king, making his entrance among his subjects,
   presented himself to them in magnificent attire and great splendor, by
   which he gained their admiration and reverence. At the same time, the
   sacred writer, under that shadowy ceremony, doubtless intended to lead
   us to consider another kind of going up more triumphant -- that of
   Christ when he "ascended up far above all heavens," (Ephesians 4:10)
   and obtained the empire of the whole world, and armed with his
   celestial power, subdued all pride and loftiness. You must remember
   what I have adverted to before, that the name Jehovah is here applied
   to the ark; for although the essence or majesty of God was not shut up
   in it, nor his power and operation fixed to it, yet it was not a vain
   and idle symbol of his presence. God had promised that he would dwell
   in the midst of the people so long as the Jews worshipped him according
   to the rule which he had prescribed in the Law; and he actually showed
   that he was truly present with them, and that it was not in vain that
   he was called upon among them. What is here stated, however, applies
   more properly to the manifestation of the glory which at length shone
   forth in the person of Christ. In short, the import of the Psalmist's
   language is, When the trumpets sounded among the Jews, according to the
   appointment of the Law, that was not a mere empty sound which vanished
   away in the air; for God, who intended the ark of the covenant to be a
   pledge and token of his presence, truly presided in that assembly. From
   this the prophet draws an argument for enforcing on the faithful the
   duty of singing praises to God He argues, that by engaging in this
   exercise they will not be acting blindly or at random, as the
   superstitious, who, having no certainty in their false systems of
   religion, lament and howl in vain before their idols. He shows that the
   faithful have just ground for celebrating with their mouths and with a
   cheerful heart the praises of God; [186] since they certainly know that
   he is as present with them, as if he had visibly established his royal
   throne among them.

   7. For God is King of all the earth The Psalmist, having called God in
   the close of the preceding verse King of the chosen people, now calls
   him King of all the earth; and thus, while he claims to the Jews the
   right and honor of primogeniture, he at the same time joins to them the
   Gentiles as associates and partakers with them of the same blessing. By
   these words he intimates that the kingdom of God would be much more
   magnificent and glorious at the coming of the Messiah, than it was
   under the shadowy dispensation of the Law, inasmuch as it would be
   extended to the utmost boundaries of the earth. To show the greater
   earnestness in his exhortation, he repeats the words, Sing praises to
   God, five times. The word mmkyl, maskil, [187] is put in the singular
   number instead of the plural; for he invites to this exercise all who
   are skillful in singing. He, no doubt, speaks of knowledge in the art
   of music; but he requires, at the same time, the worshippers of God to
   sing the praises of God intelligently, that there may not be the mere
   sound of tongues, as we know to be the case among the Papists.
   Knowledge of what is sung is required in order to engage in a proper
   manner in the singing of psalms, that the name of God may not be
   profaned, as it would certainly be, were there nothing more but the
   voice which melts away or is dissolved in the air. [188]

   8. He hath obtained the kingdom over the heathen Literally it is, He
   hath reigned; but as the verb mlk, malach, is in the past tense, which
   in Hebrew denotes a continued act, we have translated it, He hath
   obtained the kingdom The prophet repeatedly informs us that God reigns
   over the Gentiles; and from this it is easy to gather that he here
   treats of a new and a previously unheard of manner of reigning. There
   is an implied contrast between the time of the Law, when God confined
   his empire, or kingdom, within the boundaries of Judea, and the coming
   of Christ, when he extended it far and wide, so as to occupy the whole
   world from one end to the other. The majesty of God sent forth some
   sparks of its brightness among the heathen nations, when David made
   them tributary; but the prophet could not, on that account, have
   properly said that God reigned among them, since they both contemned
   his worship and the true religion, and also wished to see the Church
   completely extinguished. To find the fulfillment of this prophecy, we
   must, therefore, necessarily come to Christ. What is added in the
   second clause of the verse, God sitteth upon the throne of his
   holiness, may be taken in a twofold sense. By this form of expression
   is often to be understood the tabernacle, or the temple; but it also
   sometimes signifies heaven. If any are inclined to explain it of the
   temple, the meaning will be, That while God reigned over the whole
   world, and comprehended all nations under his dominion, he had
   established his chief seat at Jerusalem; and it was from thence that
   the doctrine of the gospel, by which he has brought under his dominion
   all people, flowed. We may, however, very properly take this expression
   as spoken of heaven; and thus the sense will be, That God, in
   stretching forth his hand to subdue men, and bring them to submit to
   his authority, evidently shows that, from his heavenly throne, he
   reigns over men. Unless he show men his power and working by signs
   manifest and near at hand, he is not acknowledged as Governor of the
   world.

   9 The princes of the peoples are gathered together. The Psalmist
   enriches and amplifies by various expressions the preceding sentence.
   He again declares that the way in which God obtained dominion over the
   Gentiles was, that those who before were aliens united in the adoption
   of the same faith with the Jews; and thus different nations, from a
   state of miserable dispersion, were gathered together into one body.
   When the doctrine of the Gospel was manifested and shone forth, it did
   not remove the Jews from the covenant which God had long before made
   with them. On the contrary, it has rather joined us to them. As then
   the calling of the Gentiles was nothing else than the means by which
   they were grafted and incorporated into the family of Abraham, the
   prophet justly states, that strangers or aliens from every direction
   were gathered together to the chosen people, that by such an increase
   the kingdom of God might be extended through all quarters of the globe.
   On this account Paul says, (Ephesians 3:6,) that the Gentiles were made
   one body with the Jews, that they might be partakers of the everlasting
   inheritance. By the abolition of the ceremonies of the Mosaic economy,
   "the middle wall of partitions" which made a separation between the
   Jews and the Gentiles, is now removed, (Ephesians 2:14;) but it
   nevertheless remains true, that we are not accounted among the children
   of God unless we have been grafted into the stock of Abraham. The
   prophet does not merely speak of the common people: he also tells us
   that princes themselves will regard it as the height of their felicity
   to be gathered together with the Jews; as we shall see in another
   psalm, (Psalm 87:5,)

   "And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her."

   Farther, it is said that this gathering together will be to the people
   of the God of Abraham, to teach us that it is not here meant to
   attribute to the Jews any superiority which they naturally possess
   above others, but that all their excellence depends upon this, that the
   pure worship of God flourishes among them, and that they hold heavenly
   doctrine in high estimation. This, therefore, is not spoken of the
   bastard or cast-off Jews, whom their own unbelief has cut off from the
   Church. But as, according to the statement of the Apostle Paul, (Romans
   11:16,) the root being holy, the branches are also holy, it follows
   that the falling away of the greater part does not prevent this honor
   from continuing to belong to the rest. Accordingly, the "consumption"
   which, as is stated in the prophecy of Isaiah, overflowed the whole
   earth, is called the people of the God of Abraham, (chapter 10:22, 23.)
   This passage contains two very important and instructive truths. In the
   first place, we learn from it, that all who would be reckoned among the
   children of God ought to seek to have a place in the Church, and to
   join themselves to it, that they may maintain fraternal unity with all
   the godly; and, secondly, that when the unity of the Church is spoken
   of, it is to be considered as consisting in nothing else but an
   unfeigned agreement to yield obedience to the word of God, that there
   may be one sheepfold and one Shepherd. Moreover, those who are exalted
   in the world in respect of honors and riches, are here admonished to
   divest themselves of all pride, and willingly and submissively to bear
   the yoke in common with others, that they may show themselves the
   obedient children of the Church.

   What follows immediately after, The shields of the earth are God's, is
   understood by many as spoken of princes. [189] I admit that this
   metaphor is of frequent occurrence in Scripture, nor does this sense
   seem to be unsuitable to the scope of the passage. It is as if the
   prophet had said, It is in the power of God to ingraft into his Church
   the great ones of the world whenever he pleases; for he reigns over
   them also. Yet the sense will be more simple if we explain the words
   thus: That, as it is God alone who defends and preserves the world, the
   high and supreme majesty, which is sufficient for so exalted and
   difficult a work as the preservation of the world, is justly looked
   upon with admiration. The sacred writer expressly uses the word shields
   in the plural number, for, considering the various and almost
   innumerable dangers which unceasingly threaten every part of the world,
   the providence of God must necessarily interpose in many ways, and make
   use, as it were, of many bucklers.

   PSALM 48

   In this psalm there is celebrated some notable deliverance of the city
   of Jerusalem at a time when many kings had conspired to destroy it. The
   prophet, (whoever was the author of the psalm,) after having given
   thanks to God for this deliverance, takes occasion from thence to extol
   in magnificent terms the happy state of that city, seeing it had God
   for its continual guardian and protector. It would not have been enough
   for the people of God to have felt and acknowledged that they were once
   preserved and defended by the power of God, had they not at the same
   time been assured of being also preserved and protected by the same God
   in the time to come, because he had adopted them for his peculiar
   people. The prophet, therefore, chiefly insists upon this point, that
   it was not in vain that the sanctuary of God was erected upon mount
   Zion, but that his name was there called upon in order that his power
   might be conspicuously manifested for the salvation of his people. It
   is easy to gather from the subject-matter of the psalm that it was
   composed after the death of David. I indeed admit that among David's
   enemies there were some foreign kings, and that it was not for want of
   will on their part that the city of Jerusalem was not utterly
   destroyed; but we do not read that they ever proceeded the length of
   besieging it, and reducing it to such extremity as to render it
   necessary that their efforts should be repressed by a wonderful
   manifestation of the power of God. It is more probable that the psalm
   is to be referred to the time of king Ahaz, when the city was besieged
   and the inhabitants brought to the point of utter despair, and when,
   nevertheless, the siege was suddenly raised, (2 Kings 16:5;) or else to
   the time of Jehoshaphat and Asa, (2 Chronicles 14:9; and 20:2) for we
   know that under their reigns Jerusalem was preserved from utter
   destruction only by miraculous aid from heaven. This we are to regard
   as certain, that the Psalmist here exhibited to true believers an
   example of the favor of God towards them, from which they had reason to
   acknowledge that their condition was happy, seeing God had chosen for
   himself a dwelling-place upon mount Zion, that from thence he might
   preside over them for their good and safety.

   A song of praise of the sons of Korah.

   Psalm 48:1-3

   1. Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God,
   in the mountain of his holiness. 2. Beautiful for situation, the joy of
   the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of
   the great King. 3. God in her palaces is known for a defence, [or
   fortress.]


   1. Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised. The prophet, before
   proceeding to make mention of that special example of the favor of God
   towards them, to which I have adverted, teaches in general that the
   city of Jerusalem was happy and prosperous, because God had been
   graciously pleased to take upon him the charge of defending and
   preserving it. In this way he separates and distinguishes the Church of
   God from all the rest of the world; and when God selects from amongst
   the whole human race a small number whom he embraces with his fatherly
   love, this is an invaluable blessing which he bestows upon them. His
   wonderful goodness and righteousness shine forth in the government of
   the whole world, so that there is no part of it void of his praise, but
   we are everywhere furnished with abundant matter for praising him.
   Here, however, the inspired poet celebrates the glory of God which is
   manifested in the protection of the Church. He states, that Jehovah is
   great, and greatly to be praised in the holy city. But is he not so
   also in the whole world? Undoubtedly he is. As I have said, there is
   not a corner so hidden, into which his wisdom, righteousness, and
   goodness, do not penetrate; but it being his will that they should be
   manifested chiefly and in a particular manner in his Church, the
   prophet very properly sets before our eyes this mirror, in which God
   gives a more clear and vivid representation of his character. By
   calling Jerusalem the holy mountain, he teaches us in one word, by what
   right and means it came to be in a peculiar manner the city of God. It
   was so because the ark of the covenant had been placed there by divine
   appointment. The import of the expression is this: If Jerusalem is, as
   it were, a beautiful and magnificent theater on which God would have
   the greatness of his majesty to be beheld, it is not owing to any
   merits of its own, but because the ark of the covenant was established
   there by the commandment of God as a token or symbol of his peculiar
   favor.

   2. Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion
   For the confirmation of the statement made in the preceding sentence,
   the prophet celebrates the excellencies for which mount Zion was at
   that time renowned; and in them was to be seen the glory of God, of
   which I have just now spoken. The beauty of its situation, which he
   mentions in the first place, was indeed natural; but by it he gives us
   to understand, that from the very commencement the agreeable appearance
   of the city had engraven upon it marks of the favor of God, so that the
   sight of it alone showed that God had in a special manner adorned and
   enriched that place, with the view of its being, at some future period,
   consecrated to sacred purposes. I do not, however, think that the
   situation is called beautiful and pleasant, merely because it was
   unequalled in the country of Judea; for there were other cities, as is
   well known, which were in no respect inferior to Jerusalem, either as
   to fertility or pleasantness of situation, and other advantages. In my
   opinion, along with the situation of the city, the Psalmist comprehends
   the glory which it derived from another source -- from the circumstance
   that the temple of God was built there. When, therefore, we hear the
   beauty of the city here celebrated, let us call to our remembrance that
   spiritual beauty which was added to the natural beauty of the place,
   after the prophecy was given forth that the ark would there abide for
   ever. With respect to the word nvph, noph, which I have translated
   situation, commentators are not agreed. Some understand it as meaning
   height or elevation, as if it had been said that Jerusalem was situated
   on high and elevated ground. Others render it climate [190] because the
   Jews metaphorically call climates branches, [191] on account of the
   extent to which they are spread out. In a matter like this, which is of
   no great consequence, I am not disposed to be so very critical. Only I
   have selected that translation which seemed to me the most probable,
   namely, that the country in its appearance was pre-eminently pleasant
   and delightful. When the Psalmist speaks of mount Zion being on the
   sides of the north, it is doubtful whether he lays it down as a
   commendation of mount Zion, that it lay or looked towards the north; or
   whether we should explain the sentence thus: Although mount Zion looks
   towards the north, that does not in any degree diminish its beauty. The
   former interpretation, however, seems to me to give the more natural
   meaning. We find the prophet Isaiah, with the view also of touching
   upon the excellence of this mountain, applying to it the very
   expression which is here employed. In the 14th chapter of his
   Prophecies, at the 13th verse, he represents Sennacherib as speaking
   thus: "I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the
   stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in
   the sides of the north."

   The Psalmist, in the next place, calls mount Zion the joy of the whole
   earth And he thus describes it, not only because, as the Jews foolishly
   talk, that country was healthy on account of the mildness of the
   climate; or because it produced sweet and excellent fruits, which might
   gratify ard yield delight to foreign nations -- for this also is a cold
   and unsatisfactory speculation; -- but because from thence salvation
   was to issue forth to the whole world, even as all nations have
   borrowed from thence the light of life, and the testimony of heavenly
   grace. If the joy which men experience and cherish is without God, the
   issue of their joy at length will be destruction, and their laughter
   will be turned into gnashing of teeth. But Christ appeared with his
   Gospel out of Zion, to fill the world with true joy and everlasting
   felicity. In the time of the prophet, the knowledge of the Gospel, it
   is true, had not yet reached foreign nations; but he makes use of this
   manner of expression with the highest propriety, to teach the Jews that
   true blessedness was to be sought for only from the gracious covenant
   of God, which was deposited in that holy place. At the same time also,
   he has foretold that which was at length fulfilled in the last time by
   the coming of Christ. From this we may learn, that to cause the hearts
   of the godly to rejoice, the favor of God alone abundantly suffices;
   as, on the contrary, when it is withdrawn, all men must inevitably be
   thrown into a state of wretchedness and sorrow. What is added
   immediately after, concerning the city of the great King, is intended
   to show, that mount Zion was not only holy itself, but that this high
   prerogative had been conferred upon it to render sacred the whole city,
   where God had chosen his seat, that he might rule over all people.

   3. God in her palaces is known for a defense Here the sacred poet again
   brings forward, for the purpose of setting forth the dignity of the
   city of Jerusalem, the protection which God afforded it; as we have
   seen in Psalm 46:5,

   "God is in the midst of her: she shall not be moved:
   God shall help her, and that right early."

   He expressly makes mention of palaces for the sake of contrast -- to
   teach the Jews, that although the holy city was fortified by strong
   towers, and had within it magnificent houses, and such as resembled
   fortresses, yet its continued safety was owing to the power and aid of
   God alone. By these words, the people of God are taught, that although
   they dwell in strongholds and palaces, they must, nevertheless, be
   carefully on their guard, that this magnificence or loftiness may not
   shroud or conceal from their view the power of God; and that they be
   not like worldly men, who, resting satisfied with riches and earthly
   means of help, set no value whatever upon having God for their guardian
   and protector. Worldly wealth, from our natural perverseness, tends to
   dazzle our eyes, and to make us forget God, and, therefore, we ought to
   meditate with special attention upon this doctrine, That whatever we
   possess, which seems worthy of being prized, must not be permitted to
   obscure the knowledge of the power and grace of God; but that, on the
   contrary, the glory of God ought always clearly to shine forth in all
   the gifts with which he may be pleased to bless and adorn us; so that
   we may account ourselves rich and happy in him, and no where else.

   [190] Beautiful in climate, that is, mount Zion is situated in a fair
   and lovely climate. This is the view taken by Montanus and Ainsworth.
   Bate and Parkhurst read, "Beautiful in extension, i.e., in the prospect
   which it extends to the eye."

   [191] Some ancient copies of the Septuagint have for the original
   words, yphh nyph, yepheh noph, which Calvin renders beautiful for
   situation, eurunon, which Augustine and Ambrose translate by dilatans,
   spreading "This," says Hammond, "may not improbably have respect to a
   notion of nvph, usual in the Misneh for the boughs or top branches of a
   tree; which some of the Jews also would have take place here, as
   comparing Zion to a beautiful well-spreading tree."

   Psalm 48:4-7

   4. For, behold! the kings assembled, they passed away together. 5. They
   saw, so they marvelled; they were frightened, they fled precipitately.
   6. Fear [192] seized upon them there, and pain as of a woman in
   travail. 7. By the east wind thou breakest in pieces the ships of
   Tarshish.


   4 For, behold! the kings assembled Here that special deliverance of
   which I have spoken is touched upon. The prophet relates how, when the
   kings were assembled together to destroy Jerusalem, their efforts
   passed away without producing any effect, even as clouds in the
   atmosphere vanish away; yea, he tells us, that by a simple look at the
   city, they were defeated and undone, and that not after an ordinary
   manner, but like a woman who, when the hour of child-birth has come
   upon her, finds herself suddenly afflicted with pain and sorrow. We
   cannot affirm with certainty what particular part of Jewish history the
   prophet here speaks of; but the statements made suit very well both the
   time of Ahaz, and that of Hezekiah or Asa. It was indeed a wonderful
   work of God, when two very powerful kings -- the king of Syria and the
   king of Israel, accompanied with an immense army -- had smitten the
   city with such terror, that the king and his people were brought to the
   brink of despair, to see this formidable host suddenly routed and
   disappointed of the certain expectation which they entertained of
   making themselves masters of the city. Hence the prophet Isaiah 7:4
   ironically calls them "smoking firebrands," because they were, so to
   speak, burning torches to kindle and consume by fire the whole country
   of Judea. Nor was the destruction of the countless host of Sennacherib
   in one night by an angel, without the intervention of man's agency, a
   less stupendous miracle, (2 Kings 19:35; Isaiah 37:36.) In like manner,
   when the king of Ethiopia gathered together an army of ten hundred
   thousand men, and came to besiege Jerusalem, the overthrow of so great
   a host was a memorable instance of the power of God, (2 Chronicles
   14:9.) But whatever was the occasion on which this psalm was composed,
   the sacred writer informs us that the Jews found from manifest
   experience that God was the guardian and protector of the holy city,
   when he opposed himself to the invincible power of their enemies. He
   first declares that the kings assembled By these words he intimates
   that they had confederated and conspired together to destroy the
   Church. The expression, passed away together, may be explained in two
   ways; either as meaning that the armies when they had gathered
   themselves together were reduced to nothing, or that they undertook
   together, and with one consent, the expedition, as it were marshalled
   in battle array.

   This second sense seems to me the most suitable to the scope of the
   passage; for it follows immediately after in the fifth verse, that they
   stood stricken with astonishment whenever they saw the city; and yet
   there will be no impropriety in understanding this verse as added by
   way of amplification. But as it affects very little the substance of
   the passage which of these two interpretations is adopted, I leave the
   reader to choose that which he considers the most appropriate. When the
   Psalmist says that upon beholding the city they marvelled -- were
   frightened -- fled precipitately -- and were seized with sorrow, like
   the pangs of a woman in travail -- he heaps together as many and varied
   expressions as possible, in order to set forth the greatness of the
   miracle which God had wrought in the overthrow of such a vast and
   formidable host. The language should be resolved thus: As soon as they
   saw the city they marvelled. It is related of Caesar in ancient times,
   that when speaking of the ease with which he subdued Egypt, he made use
   of the laconic saying, "I came, I saw, I conquered;" but the prophet
   here states, on the contrary, that the ungodly were struck with
   amazement at the mere sight of the city, as if God had dazzled their
   eyes with the splendor of his glory. The particle kn, ken, so, is put
   as it were to show the thing by pointing to it with the finger. In the
   verse which immediately follows, the adverb sm, sham, there, is used in
   the same sense. The comparison of a woman in travail is intended to
   express the sudden change which came upon the enemies of Israel. It
   afforded a more bright and illustrious manifestation of the grace of
   God, that they were seized with a fear which they had not anticipated,
   lost their courage all at once, and from the height of secure and
   presumptuous pride, instantly fell into such a state of terror, and
   were so confounded, that they precipitately betook themselves to
   flight. [193] From this passage we are taught that it is no uncommon
   thing, if in our day the Church is assailed by powerful adversaries,
   and has to sustain dreadful assaults; for it has been God's usual way
   from the beginning thus to humble his own people, in order to give more
   irrefragable and striking proofs of his wonderful power. At the same
   time, let us remember that a nod alone on the part of God is sufficient
   to deliver us; and that, although our enemies may be ready to fall upon
   us on every side to overwhelm us, it is in his power, whenever he
   pleases, to strike them with amazement of spirit, and thus to make
   their hearts fail in a moment in the very midst of their efforts
   against us. Let this reflection serve as a bridle to keep our minds
   from being drawn away, to look in all directions for human aid.

   7. By the east wind [194] thou breakest in pieces the ships of Tarshish
   Commentators are divided in their view of this passage. [195] But let
   us rest contented with the natural sense, which is simply this, that
   the enemies of the Church were overthrown and plunged into destruction,
   just as God by suddenly raising storms sinks the ships of Cilicia to
   the bottom of the sea. The Psalmist celebrates the power which God is
   accustomed to display in great and violent storms; and his language
   implies that it is not to be wondered at if God, who breaks by the
   violence of the winds the strongest ships, had also overthrown his
   enemies, who were inflated with the presumptuous confidence which they
   reposed in their own strength. By the sea of Tarshish the Hebrews mean
   the Mediterranean Sea, because of the country of Cilicia, which in
   ancient times was called Tarshish, as Josephus informs us, although in
   process of time this name came to be restricted to one city of the
   country. But as the chief part of the naval traffic of the Jews was
   with Cilicia, there is here attributed to that country by synecdoche
   what was common to other countries which were at a greater distance and
   less known.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [192] "Tremblement." -- Fr. "Trembling."

   [193] "Et d'une fierte pleine d'asseurance et outrecuidance sont
   incontinent tombez en espouvantement et ont tellement este estourdis,
   qu'ils s'en sont fuis grand erre." -- Fr.

   [194] The east wind in Judea and in the Mediterranean is very
   tempestuous and destructive. It is also very dry and parching, as well
   as sudden and terrible in its action. Genesis 41:6; Exodus 14:21;
   Ezekiel 19:12; and 27:26; Job 27:21; Isaiah 27:8; Jeremiah 18:17; Jonah
   4:8. Hence the LXX. translate the original words, "En pneumati biaio,"
   "With a violent wind;" and the Chaldee reads, "A strong east wind as a
   fire from before the Lord." "Such a wind," says Bishop Mant, "is well
   known to the modern mariner by the name of Levanter, and is of the same
   kind as that spoken of in the twenty-seventh chapter of the Acts of the
   Apostles, under the name of Euroclydon."

   [195] It is supposed by some that there is in it an implied similitude;
   the particle of similitude used in the preceding verse being
   understood. Thus French and Skinner translate the 6th and 7th verses --
   "Then did trembling seize upon them -- Pangs as of a woman in travail
   -- As when with a stormy wind, Thou breakest in pieces the ships of
   Tarshish." According to this translation, "the ships of Tarshish" do
   not refer to an invading army, nor "the breaking in pieces of them" to
   an actual storm which had this effect; but the sacred writer employs
   another figure, the more vividly to describe the terror which seized
   upon these confederate powers. He had in the preceding verse compared
   it with the pangs of a woman in travail; and here he compares it to the
   trembling which seized upon mariners when the fury of the east wind,
   which shattered in pieces the largest and strongest vessels, as the
   ships of Tarshish probably then were, was let loose upon them.

   Psalm 48:8-10

   8. As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of Jehovah of hosts,
   [or armies,] in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever.
   Selah. 9. O God! we have waited for thy mercy in the midst of thy
   temple. 10. As is thy name, O God! so is thy praise unto the ends of
   the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.


   8. As we have heard, so have we seen. There are two senses in which
   this passage may be understood, either of which is suitable. The first
   is, that the sacred writer, speaking in the name of true believers,
   declares that the same power which God in the days of old had displayed
   in delivering their fathers, he now exercised towards their posterity.
   They had heard from the mouth of their fathers, and had learned from
   sacred history, how God in his great mercy and fatherly goodness had
   succoured his Church; but now they affirm that they can bear testimony
   to this not only from their having heard it spoken about, but also from
   having seen it, [196] inasmuch as they had actually experienced the
   same mercy exercised by God towards themselves. The amount of what is
   stated then is, that the faithful not only had a record of the goodness
   and power of God in histories, but that they also felt by actual
   experience, yea, even saw with their eyes, what they knew before by
   hearsay, and the report of their fathers; and that therefore God
   continues unchangeably the same, confirming as he does, age after age,
   the examples of his grace exhibited in ancient times, by renewed and
   ever-recurring experiences. The other sense is somewhat more refined;
   and yet it is very suitable, namely, That God actually performed what
   he had promised to his people; as if the faithful had said, that what
   they had before only heard of was now exhibited before their eyes. As
   long as we have only the bare promises of God, his grace and salvation
   are as yet hidden in hope; but when these promises are actually
   performed, his grace and salvation are clearly manifested. If this
   interpretation is admitted, it contains the rich doctrine, that God
   does not disappoint the hope which he produces in our minds by means of
   his word, and that it is not His way to be more liberal in promising
   than faithful in performing what he has promised. When it is said, in
   the city, the letter v, beth, is taken for m, mem, or l, lamed; that is
   to say, for of, or as to, or with respect to the city. The prophet does
   not mean to say that in Jerusalem the faithful were informed that God
   would succor his servants, although this was no doubt true, but that
   God from the beginning had been the gracious and faithful guardian of
   his own city, and would continue always to be so. Mention is expressly
   made of the city of God, because he has not promised to extend the same
   protecting care to all indiscriminately, but only to his chosen and
   peculiar people. The name Jehovah of armies is employed to express the
   power of God; but immediately after the faithful add, that he is their
   God, for the purpose of pointing to their adoption, that thus they may
   be emboldened to trust in him, and thus to betake themselves freely and
   familiarly to him. In the second Council of Nice, the good fathers who
   sat there wrested this passage to prove that it is not enough to teach
   divine truth in churches, unless there are at the same time pictures
   and images for confirming it. This was a piece of silliness very
   shameful, and unworthy of being mentioned, were it not that it is
   profitable for us to understand that those who purposed to infect the
   Church of God with such a corruption, were horribly stricken with a
   spirit of giddiness and stupidity.

   The concluding clause of the verse distinguishes Jerusalem from all the
   other cities of the world, which are subject to vicissitudes, and
   flourish only for a time. As Jerusalem was founded by God, it continued
   steadfast and unmoved amidst the varied commotions and revolutions
   which took place in the world; and it is not to be wondered at, if he
   continued through successive ages to maintain the city of which he made
   choice, and in which it was his will that his name should be called
   upon for ever. It may, however, be objected, that this city was once
   destroyed, and the people carried into captivity. But this does not
   militate against the statement here made; for, before that event
   happened, the restoration of the city was foretold by Jeremiah 27:22;
   and, therefore, when it took place, God truly, and in a special manner,
   showed how steadfast his work was. And now, since Christ by his coming
   has renewed the world, whatever was spoken of that city in old time
   belongs to the spiritual Jerusalem, which is dispersed through all the
   countries of the world. Whenever, therefore, our minds are agitated and
   perplexed, we should call to remembrance the truth, that, whatever
   dangers and apprehensions may threaten us, the safety of the Church
   which God has established, although it may be sorely shaken, can never,
   however powerfully assaulted, be so weakened as to fall and be involved
   in ruin. The verb, which is in the future tense, will establish, may be
   resolved into the past tense, has established; but this will make no
   difference as to the sense.

   9 O God! we have waited for thy mercy This verse teaches us that the
   faithful were preserved by the power of God; for, when all things were
   in a state of the greatest confusion, they continued tranquil and
   patient until God at length, having pity upon them, brought them help.
   The Hebrew word, dmm, damam, which we have rendered to wait, properly
   signifies to be silent, and is here used to denote tranquillity of
   mind. From this we conclude, that the people of God were so harassed
   with dangers, that, had they listened to the judgment of carnal sense
   and reason, they would have been overwhelmed with terror; even as we
   know that men are in a state of continual uneasiness, and are driven
   hither and thither by contrary waves, until faith tranquillise their
   minds, and settle them in true patience. The amount of what the
   Psalmist says is, that the faithful, although severely afflicted, were
   not driven from their purpose, and prevented from relying upon the aid
   of God; but that, on the contrary, by their patience and hope, they
   opened the gate of his grace. It served to magnify and illustrate the
   greatness of the grace of God, that their expectations of assistance
   from him were not disappointed. From this we may also deduce the
   profitable warning, that if the aid of God is withdrawn from us, it is
   because we distrust his promises, and, by our impatience, prevent his
   grace, which is laid up for those who wait in patience, from flowing
   upon us. But what is meant by the expression, In the midst of the
   temple? Is it that the people of God maintained their faith only in
   that place, and that each of them ceased to hope as soon as he returned
   to his own dwelling? No; on the contrary, it is certain that they
   carried home with them the hope which they had entertained in the
   temple, that they might continue steadfastly to abide by it. But God
   having promised that this place, in which he would be called upon,
   would be the seat and dwelling-place of his power and grace, his people
   here affirm, that, relying upon this heavenly promise, they were
   persuaded beyond all doubt that God would show himself merciful and
   gracious towards them, since they had a real and sure pledge of his
   presence. We must not conceive, merely because our own fancy suggests
   it, that God will be our deliverer. We are to believe that he will be
   so only in so far as he freely and willingly offers himself to us in
   this character. Now, if this symbol or pledge of the presence of God,
   which was only a shadow, ought to have had such influence upon the
   minds of true believers under the former dispensation, as to make them
   hope for life in the midst of death, surely when Christ has now
   descended amongst us, to unite us much more closely to his Father, we
   have sufficient ground for continuing in a state of undisturbed
   tranquillity, although the world should be embroiled in confusion and
   turned upside down. Only it must be our endeavor that the service of
   God may flourish pure and entire amongst us, and that thus the glory of
   his temple may shine forth in the midst of us.

   10. As is thy name, O God! so is thy praise Some connect this verse
   with the preceding sentence, as if it had been said, Lord, it is not in
   vain that thou hast enjoined upon us the duty of celebrating thy name;
   for thou furnishest at the same time matter of praise. Thus the sense
   will be, that the name of God is magnified and extolled with effect, or
   that along with his promises his power is at the same time manifested.
   Others give this exposition, which is somewhat more refined, That the
   works of God correspond with his name; for in Hebrew he is called, 'l,
   El, [197] from his power, and he shows in very deed that this name is
   not applied to him in vain, but that the praise which is ascribed to
   him by it is right and what is due to him. The former exposition, as it
   is less forced, so it comes nearer to the words and mind of the sacred
   writer, namely, that God bore testimony by his works that it was not in
   vain that he was acknowledged and worshipped by the Jews as the true
   and only God. Yet when I come to consider the words which follow
   immediately after, Unto the ends of the earth, I think that the prophet
   meant something else, -- that he intended to show, that wherever the
   fame of the name of God may be spread, men will know that he is worthy
   of the highest praise. The words contain a tacit contrast. At that
   time, the names of idols, it is well known, were very common, and had
   sway through the whole world; and yet, whatever fame these counterfeit
   gods had acquired, we know that praise in no respect belonged to them,
   since no sign of divinity whatever could be discovered about them. But
   here the prophet, on the contrary, declares, Lord, in whatever part of
   the world thy name is heard, it will always be accompanied with solid
   and rightful praise, or it will ever carry along with it matter of
   praise, since the whole world will understand how thou hast dealt with
   thy chosen people. What is added immediately after is to the same
   purpose, Thy right hand is full of righteousness, teaching us, that
   God, in succouring his own people, clearly manifests his righteousness,
   as if he stretched forth his arm to us that we might touch his
   righteousness with the finger; and that he shows not only one specimen
   or two of his righteousness, but in every thing and every where
   exhibits to us a complete proof of it. We ought to bear in mind what we
   have stated elsewhere, that the righteousness of God is to be
   understood of his faithfulness which he observes in maintaining and
   defending his own people. From this there accrues to us the inestimable
   comfort, that the work in which God especially desires to be
   acknowledged as righteous consists in providing what belongs to our
   welfare and to our maintenance in safety. [198] We now see that the
   meaning of the inspired poet is, That the names of false gods
   prevailed, and were renowned among men, although they had done nothing
   to furnish matter of true praise; but that it was altogether different
   with respect to the God of Israel: for wherever the report of him was
   carried, all would understand that he was the deliverer of his people,
   and that he did not disappoint their hope and desires, nor forsake them
   in danger.

   Psalm 48:11-14

   11. Mount Zion shall rejoice, the daughters [199] of Judah shall be
   glad, because of thy judgments. 12. Encompass Zion, and go round about
   her, number her towers. 13. Set your hearts [200] to her walls, exalt
   her towers, [201] that ye may make report to the generation to come.
   14. For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide
   even unto death.


   11 Mount Zion shall rejoice The Psalmist now concludes his exhortation
   to rejoicing, telling us that Jerusalem and the other cities of Judea
   shall have cause to commend the righteousness of God, [202] because
   they had found from undoubted experience that he was the protector of
   their welfare. He here makes use of the word judgment, because God, who
   undertook the cause of his Church, openly showed that he was the enemy
   of her oppressors, and that he would repress their presumption and
   audacity.

   12 and 13 Encompass Zion, etc. Here the prophet again commends the
   situation and beauty of Jerusalem, intimating that the city was
   strongly fortified and impregnable; and he does this, because in these
   external things the blessing of God in some respect shone forth. We
   must always bear in mind what he stated in a preceding verse, that "God
   in her palaces is known for a fortress." In making mention here of her
   towers and walls, we are not to suppose that he would have the minds of
   the faithful to rest in these things. He rather sets them before us as
   a mirror in which the character of God may be seen. He therefore says,
   Encompass Zion that is, look upon it carefully and attentively on every
   side; -- number her towers, and apply your mind to consider her walls;
   that is, estimate her palaces as they deserve, and thus it will be
   manifest beyond all doubt that this is a city chosen of God, seeing it
   far surpasses all other cities. In insisting upon these points, his
   whole drift is to make manifest the character with which the Lord had
   invested Jerusalem in making it a sacred place, in which he himself
   might take up his abode, and in erecting it as a dwelling-place for his
   people. It seems, moreover, that the prophet, in stating that the
   object of his exhortation was, that the beauty and magnificence of the
   holy city might be reported to the succeeding generation, tacitly gives
   us to understand, that the time would at length come when that city
   would be no longer seen. What need would there be for making this
   report if it could be seen and were always before the eyes of the
   world? Although, then, he has said a little before that Jerusalem is
   established for ever, yet he now teaches us, by way of correction, what
   kind of perpetuity it will be -- that it will endure only till the time
   of the renovation of the Church. We belong to that generation to come,
   to whom it is said these things will be reported; for we are sharers in
   all the benefits which God, in the days of old, bestowed upon his
   ancient people. The outward splendor for which Jerusalem was admired
   does not, indeed, stand forth conspicuous amongst us at the present
   day; but since the coming of Christ into our world, the Church has been
   no less richly and magnificently adorned with spiritual gifts than
   Jerusalem, under the shadows of the Law, was in old time surrounded and
   fortified with strong walls and towers. I have translated the word
   phsgv, pasgu, exalt, referring it to the value which ought to be put
   upon the towers of the city because of their excellence. To explain it,
   as is done by some, fortify or strengthen, seems to be less suitable.
   If any are inclined rather to follow the interpretation of those who
   render it look upon or behold, I have no great objection to it.

   14. For this God is our God for ever and ever From these words it
   appears still more clearly, that when the prophet spake of the palaces
   of Jerusalem, it was not that the godly should keep their eyes fixed
   upon them, but that by the aid of these outward things they should
   elevate their minds to the contemplation of the glory of God. God would
   have them to behold, as it were, the marks of his grace engraven
   wherever they turned themselves, or rather, to recognize him as present
   in these marks. From this we conclude, that whatever dignity or
   excellence shines forth in the Church, we are not to consider it
   otherwise than as the means of presenting God to our view, that we may
   magnify and praise him in his gifts. The demonstrative pronoun zh, zeh,
   this, is not superfluous; it is put to distinguish the only true God,
   of whose existence and character the faithful were fully persuaded,
   from all the false gods which men have set themselves to invent. The
   unbelieving may boldly speak of the name of God, and prate about
   religion; but however much they may do this, when they are more closely
   questioned, it will be found that they have nothing certain or settled
   on the subject. Yea, the vain imaginations and inventions of those who
   are not grounded in the true faith must necessarily come to nothing. It
   is, then, the property of faith to set before us not a confused but a
   distinct knowledge of God, and such as may not leave us wavering, as
   superstition leaves its votaries, which, we know, is always introducing
   some new counterfeit deities and in countless numbers. We ought,
   therefore, so much the more to mark the emphatic demonstrative pronoun
   this, which is here used. We meet with an almost similar passage in the
   prophecies of Isaiah,

   "Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this
   is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his
   salvation:"-- Isaiah 25:9

   as if the faithful had protested and declared, We have not an uncertain
   God, or a God of whom we have only a confused and an indistinct
   apprehension, but one of whom we have a true and solid knowledge. When
   the faithful here declare that God will continue unchangeably steadfast
   to his purpose in maintaining his Church, their object is to encourage
   and strengthen themselves to persevere in a continued course of faith.
   What follows immediately after, He will be our guide even unto death,
   seems to be added by way of exposition. In making this statement, the
   people of God assure themselves that he will be their guide and keeper
   for ever. They are not to be understood as meaning that they will be
   safe under the government and conduct of God in this life only, and
   that he will abandon them in the midst of death; but they express
   generally, and according to the common people's way of speaking, [203]
   what I have stated, that God will take care of all who rely upon him
   even to the end. What we translate, Even unto death, consists of two
   words in the Hebrew text, 'l mvt, al muth; but some read in one word,
   'lmvt, almuth, and take it for age or eternity [204] The sense,
   however, will be the same whether we read the one way or the other.
   Others translate it childhood, [205] in this sense, As God has from the
   beginning carefully preserved and maintained his Church, even as a
   father brings up his children from their infancy, so he will continue
   to act in the same manner. The first sense, however, in my opinion, is
   the more appropriate. Others translate it in secret or hidden, [206]
   which seems equally remote from the meaning of the prophet; unless,
   perhaps, we should understand him as intending expressly to say, that
   God's way of exercising his government is hidden, that we may not
   measure or judge of it by carnal reason, but by faith.

   PSALM 49

   The wicked and the votaries of worldly pleasure often enjoy prosperity,
   while such as fear the Lord are exposed to affliction, and disposed to
   faint under the pressure of it. To moderate that pride which the one
   class is apt to feel in the midst of their success, and administer a
   check to the despondency of the other, the Psalmist shows what little
   reason we have to envy the supposed happiness of the ungodly, which,
   even when at its height, is vain and evanescent; and he teaches us that
   good men, however great their trials may be, are objects of the divine
   regard, and will be eventually delivered from their enemies.

   To the Chief musician, a psalm of the sons of Korah. [207]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 49:1-4

   1. Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:
   2. Both ye sons of Adam, [208] and ye sons of men, [209] rich and poor,
   together. 3. My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my
   heart shall be of understanding. 4. I will incline my ear to a parable:
   [210] I will open my enigma [211] upon the harp.


   1. Hear this, all ye people. Whoever may have been the penman of this
   psalm, it discusses one of the most important principles in divine
   philosophy, and there is a propriety in the elevated terms designed to
   awaken and secure attention, with which the Psalmist announces his
   purpose to discourse of things of a deep and momentous nature. To a
   superficial view, indeed, the subject might seem trite and
   common-place, treating, as he does, of the shortness of human life, and
   the vanity of those objects in which worldly men confide. But the real
   scope of the psalm is, to comfort the people of God under the
   sufferings to which they are exposed, by teaching them to expect a
   happy change in their condition, when God, in his own time, shall
   interpose to rectify the disorders of the present system. There is a
   higher lesson still inculcated by the Psalmist -- that, as God's
   providence of the world is not presently apparent, we must exercise
   patience, and rise superior to the suggestions of carnal sense in
   anticipating the favorable issue. That it is our duty to maintain a
   resolute struggle with our afflictions, however severe these may be,
   and that it were foolish to place happiness in the enjoyment of such
   fleeting possessions as the riches, honors, or pleasures of this world,
   may be precepts which even the heathen philosophers have enforced, but
   they have uniformly failed in setting before us the true source of
   consolation. However admirably they discourse of a happy life, they
   confine themselves entirely to commendations upon virtue, and do not
   bring prominently forward to our view that God, who governs the world,
   and to whom alone we can repair with confidence in the most desperate
   circumstances. But slender comfort can be derived upon this subject
   from the teaching of philosophy. If, therefore, the Holy Ghost in this
   psalm introduces to our notice truths which are sufficiently familiar
   to experience, it is that he may raise our minds from them to the
   higher truth of the divine government of the world, assuring us of the
   fact, that God sits supreme, even when the wicked are triumphing most
   in their success, or when the righteous are trampled under the foot of
   contumely, and that a day is coming when he will dash the cup of
   pleasure out of the hands of his enemies, and rejoice the hearts of his
   friends, by delivering them out of their severest distresses. This is
   the only consideration which can impart solid comfort under our
   afflictions. Formidable and terrible in themselves, they would
   overwhelm our souls, did not the Lord lift upon us the light of his
   countenance. Were we not assured that he watches over our safety, we
   could find no remedy from our evils, and no quarter to which we might
   resort under them.

   The remarks which have been made may explain the manner in which the
   inspired writer introduces the psalm, soliciting our attention, as
   about to discourse on a theme unusually high and important. Two things
   are implied in this verse, that the subject upon which he proposes to
   enter is of universal application, and that we require to be admonished
   and aroused ere we are brought to a due measure of consideration. The
   words which I have translated, inhabitants of the world, are translated
   by others, inhabitants of time; but this is a harsh mode of expression,
   however much it may agree with the scope of the psalm. He calls upon
   all men indiscriminately, because all were equally concerned in the
   truths which he intended to announce. By sons of Adam, we may
   understand the meaner or lower class of mankind; and by sons of men,
   [212] the high, the noble, or such as sustain any pre-eminence in life.
   Thus, in the outset, he states it to be his purpose to instruct high
   and low without exception; his subject being one in which the whole
   human family was interested, and in which every individual belonging to
   it required to be instructed.

   3. My mouth shall speak of wisdom The prophet was warranted in applying
   these commendatory terms to the doctrine which he was about to
   communicate. It is, no doubt, by plain appeals to observation that we
   find him reproving human folly; but the general principle upon which
   his instruction proceeds is one by no means obvious to the common sense
   of mankind, not to say that his design in using such terms is less to
   assert the dignity of his subject than simply to awaken attention. This
   he does all the more effectually by speaking as one who would apply his
   own mind to instruction rather than assume the office of exhortation.
   He puts himself forward as an humble scholar, one who, in acting the
   part of teacher, has an eye at the same time to his own improvement. It
   were desirable that all the ministers of God should be actuated by a
   similar spirit, disposing them to regard God as at once their own
   teacher and that of the common people, and to embrace in the first
   place themselves that divine word which they preach to others. [213]
   The Psalmist had another object in view. He would secure the greater
   weight and deference to his doctrine by announcing that he had no
   intention to vend fancies of his own, but to advance what he had
   learned in the school of God. This is the true method of instruction to
   be followed in the Church. The man who holds the office of teacher must
   apply himself to the reception of truth before he attempt to
   communicate it, and in this manner become the means of conveying to the
   hands of others that which God has committed to his own. Wisdom is not
   the growth of human genius. It must be sought from above, and it is
   impossible that any should speak with the propriety and knowledge
   necessary for the edification of the Church, who has not, in the first
   place, been taught at the feet of the Lord. To condescend upon the
   words, some read in the third verse, And the meditation of my heart
   shall speak of understanding But as it were a harsh and improper
   expression to say that the meditation of the heart speaks, I have
   adopted the simpler reading.

   4. I will incline my ear [214] to a parable The Hebrew word msl,
   mashal, [215] which I have translated parable, properly denotes a
   similitude; but it is often applied to any deep or weighty sayings,
   because these are generally embellished with figures and metaphors. The
   noun which follows, chydt, chidoth [216] and which I have rendered an
   enigma, or riddle, is to be understood in nearly the same sense. In
   Ezekiel 17:2, we have both the nouns with their corresponding verbs
   joined together, chvr chydh vmsl msl, chud chedah umshol mashal, the
   literal translation being, "Enigmatize an enigma, and parabolize a
   parable." I am aware that the reference in this place is to an
   allegorical discourse, but I have already adverted to the reason why,
   in Hebrew, the name of enigmas or similitudes is given to any
   remarkable or important sayings. The Psalmist, when he adds that he
   will open his dark saying, shows that nothing was farther from his
   intention than to wrap the subject of his discourse in perplexing and
   intricate obscurity. The truths of revelation are so high as to exceed
   our comprehension; but, at the same time, the Holy Spirit has
   accommodated them so far to our capacity, as to render all Scripture
   profitable for instruction. None can plead ignorance: for the deepest
   and most difficult doctrines are made plain to the most simple and
   unlettered of mankind. I see little force in the idea suggested by
   several interpreters, of the Psalmist having employed his harp, that he
   might render a subject in itself harsh and disagreeable more engaging
   by the charms of music. He would merely follow the usual practice of
   accompanying the psalm with the harp.

   -- Fr. marg. "Or, grave sentence."

   [211] "Ou, dire obscur." -- Fr. marg. "Or, obscure saying."

   [212] The original words for the first of these expressions are, vny
   'dm bene adam; and those for the second, vny 'ys bene ish 'dm, adam,
   from 'dmh, adamah, earth, means an earthly, frail, mortal, mean man.
   The term 'ys, ish, on the other hand, is often used to describe a man
   who is great and eminent, distinguished for his extraction, strength,
   valor, and dignity. Thus, in 1 Samuel 25:15, we read, "Art thou not
   'ys, ish, a man?" which is explained by what follows, "And who is like
   thee in Israel?" denoting there the military valor and reputation of
   Abner. When the two expressions, vny 'dm, bene adam, and vny 'ys, bene
   ish, are used together as in this place, in Psalm 62:9, Isaiah 2:9, and
   5:15, the Jewish Rabbins and modern Christian interpreters have
   understood a difference of rank to be stated; the former expression,
   denoting persons of obscure birth, of low rank, the common people: and
   the latter, meaning men of illustrious descent, the great or nobler
   sorts of men. See Archbishop Secker's Dissertation on the words 'nvs
   'ys 'dm, in Appendix to Merrick's Annotations on the Psalms, No. 5. The
   Septuagint translates the former phrase by "Hoi gegeneis," the
   earth-born." The Chaldee expresses the former by the sons of old Adam,
   and the latter by the sons of Jacob; thus intending to comprehend Jews
   and Gentiles, all men in the world. "But," says Hammond, "it is more
   likely that the phrases denote only the several conditions of men, men
   of the lower and higher rank, for so the consequeents interpret it,
   rich and poor."

   [213] "Aussi certes il est bien requis que tous les Prophetes de Dieu
   ayent un tel vouloir et affection, ascavoir qu'ils souffrent volontiers
   que Dieu soit leur maistre aussi bien que de tout le peuple, et qu'ils
   recoyvent tous les premiers sa parolle, laquelle ils portent de leur
   bouche aux autres." -- Fr.

   [214] Bythner and Fry are of opinion, that "the inclining of the ear"
   is a metaphor taken from the position of the minstrel, who, in
   accommodating his words to the tune, brings his ear close to the harp,
   that he may catch the sounds. Thus the Psalmist expresses the sense he
   himself had of the importance of his subject, and his purpose of giving
   to it the most serious attention.

   [215] This word is of great latitude in its signification. It signifies
   primarily any similitude by which another thing is expressed. Thence it
   comes to denote a figurative discourse, either in the form of fiction
   and fable, such as riddles or significant apologues, as that of Jotham,
   Judges 9:7, or in which application is made of some true example or
   similitude, as when the sluggard is bidden "go to the ant," and the
   impenitent sinner to consider the "swallow and crane," which return at
   their certain seasons, and so are fitted to give a lesson to sinners to
   repent. And, finally, it belongs to all moral doctrine, either darkly
   or sententiously delivered; wise men, in ancient times, having been in
   the habit of delivering their lessons in short concise sentences,
   sometimes in schemes and figures, and sometimes without them, as we see
   in the Proverbs of Solomon, many of which are plain moral sayings
   without any figure or comparison. Of this sort is that which is here
   introduced to our attention; it is a moral theme not much veiled with
   figures, nor so concise as proverbs usually are, but which contains the
   most instructive lessons on the vanity of the prosperity of all wicked
   men. See Hammond in loco.

   [216] This word is derived from an Arabic root which signifies to bend
   a thing aside, to tie knots, etc.; and thus it means an intricate
   species of composition, a riddle It is used for a riddle in the story
   of Samson, Judges 14:14, 15; and for difficult questions, as those put
   by the Queen of Sheba to Solomon, 1 Kings 10:1. See Lowth's Lectures on
   Sacred Poetry, volume1, p. 78. Accordingly, it is here rendered by the
   Septuagint, "to problema mou," "my problem or difficult question,"
   which is not only asked in the fifth verse, but also answered in the
   subsequent verses. The word, however, is also applied to poetical
   compositions of a highly adorned and finished style, in which nothing
   enigmatical appears, but which contain weighty and important matter set
   forth in the parabolic style to secure the reader's or the hearer's
   attention, Psalm 78:2. See Gesenius' Lexicon. In the subject-matter of
   this psalm there does not appear to be any thing peculiarly intricate.
   It treats of the vanity of riches, and the folly of those who trust in
   them; their insufficiency to save from the power of death; and the
   final triumph of all the suffering people of God over their rich and
   haughty persecutors. This is indeed a dark theme to the worldly-minded
   man; but it contains nothing occult or mysterious to those who are
   taught of God.

   Psalm 49:5-9

   5. Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil? the iniquity of my heel
   shall compass me about. 6. They trust in their wealth, and boast
   themselves in the multitude of their riches. 7. The brother shall not
   be able to redeem, [literally, shall not redeem by redeeming;] none
   shall give to God the price of his redemption. 8. And the redemption of
   their soul shall be precious, and their continuance for ever. 9. That
   he should still live for ever, and not see the grave.


   5. Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil? The Psalmist now enters
   upon the point on which he proposed to discourse, That the people of
   God must not yield to despondency even in the most distressing
   circumstances, when their enemies may seem to have enclosed them on
   every side, but must rest assured that God, although he connives for a
   time, is awake to their condition, and only watches the best
   opportunity of executing his judgments. This manner of introducing the
   subject by interrogation is much more emphatic than if he had simply
   asserted his resolution to preserve his mind undisturbed in the midst
   of adversity. In the second clause of the verse he particularises the
   heaviest and most bitter of all afflictions, those which are
   experienced by the righteous when their enemies triumph in the
   unrestrained indulgence of their wickedness. When, the adverb of time,
   must therefore be understood -- When the iniquity of my heel shall
   compass me about There is a different meaning which some interpreters
   have attached to the words, namely, If I should fear in the days of
   evil, and be guilty of the excessive anxieties of the unbeliever, -- in
   that case, when the hour of my death came, my iniquity would compass me
   about. The heel they take to be the end of life. But this
   interpretation is to be dismissed at once as most unnatural. Nor do I
   see what reason others have for referring this word to the thoughts,
   for I believe that in no other part of Scripture can such a metaphor or
   similitude be found. Others, with more plausibility, have rendered the
   original word liers in wait, [217] because the Hebrew verb qv, akab,
   signifies to deceive; and they consider the Psalmist as intimating,
   that he would not fear though crafty and treacherous men laid snares
   for him. In my opinion, there is no figure intended; and he means to
   say, that he would have no fear when his enemies surrounded him, and in
   pursuing him, trode, as it were, upon his heel. The French have a
   similar expression, "Poursuyvre jusques aux talons." [218] I agree with
   them, that he speaks of enemies, but it is of their wicked persecution
   as they press upon him in the height of their power, and with design to
   destroy him, keep themselves near him, and tread, so to speak, upon his
   very heel.

   6. They trust in their wealth. We are now furnished with the reason why
   the suffering children of God should dismiss their apprehensions, and
   keep themselves from despondency, even when reduced to extremity by the
   violence and treachery of their enemies. Any boasted power which they
   possess is fleeting and evanescent. The Psalmist would convince us that
   the fear of man is unwarrantable; that it argues ignorance of what man
   is even at his best; and that it were as reasonable to startle at a
   shadow or a spectre. They boast themselves, he adds, in the multitude
   of their riches, and this is an error into which we are disposed to
   fall, forgetting that the condition of man in this world is fluctuating
   and transitory. It is not merely from the intrinsic insufficiency of
   wealth, honors, or pleasures, to confer true happiness, that the
   Psalmist proves the misery of worldly men, but from their manifest and
   total incapacity of forming a correct judgment of such possessions.
   Happiness is connected with the state of mind of that man who enjoys
   it, and none would call those happy who are sunk in stupidity and
   security, and are destitute of understanding. The Psalmist
   satisfactorily proves the infatuation of the wicked from the confidence
   which they place in their power and wealth, and their disposition to
   boast of them. It is a convincing sign of folly when one cannot discern
   what is before his eyes. Not a day passes without forcing the plain
   fact upon their notice, that none can redeem the life of another; so
   that their conduct is nothing less than insanity. Some read, A man
   shall not be able to redeem his brother; which amounts to the same
   meaning, and the text admits of this translation. The Hebrew word 'ch,
   ach, which I have rendered brother, is by others translated one; but I
   do not approve, although I would not absolutely reject, this reading.
   The Psalmist adds, that none can give a price to God for the ransom of
   another, where he adverts to the truth that men's lives are absolutely
   at the disposal of God, and that they never can be extended by any
   human arrangement one moment beyond the period which God has fixed.

   He enforces the same lesson in the verse which follows, where he states
   that the redemption of their soul is precious, an expression not to be
   understood as implying merely that it is an event of rare occurrence,
   but that it never can take place, as 1 Samuel 3:1, where the word of
   the Lord is said to have been precious under the priesthood of Eli,
   when it is evidently meant that it had ceased altogether. The Psalmist
   would assert that no man can hope to purchase an immortality either for
   himself or others in this world. I have rendered the close of verse 8,
   And their continuance for ever; but others, who construe the Hebrew
   word chdl, chadal, as a verb, meaning to cease, read, And ceaseth for
   ever, as if the Psalmist meant that no price was sufficiently great to
   answer the purpose, and that it must therefore cease for ever, as what
   could never obtain the end desired. I consider that which I have given
   to be the real meaning of the word, having had occasion already to
   [7]observe upon Psalm 39:5, that it signifies the fixed term of human
   life. The words in verse 9, That he should still live for ever, more
   fully express the truth, that it is not merely impossible to redeem the
   life of men when they are dead, but impossible while they are yet
   living, to extend the term of their existence. A definite limit has
   been assigned to every man's life. This he cannot pass over, and the
   Psalmist would impress the fact upon us as one which stamps folly upon
   the conduct of the wicked, who will cherish their unfounded confidence
   even at the moment when they are upon the brink of the grave. In all
   this, it may strike the reader that he has not announced any thing
   which merits being called a dark saying, and has rather been treating a
   popular subject in a very plain style of language; but if he consider
   that David here condemns, as by a voice issuing from the awful
   judgment-seat of God, the stupidity of such as forget that they are
   men, he will not be disposed to reckon the expression inapplicable.
   Again, we have seen that he has opened his dark saying, it being the
   divine will that instruction should be delivered in a form adapted to
   the meanest capacity.

   Psalm 49:10-12

   10. For he shall see that wise men die, the fool and the brutish person
   shall perish together, and shall leave their wealth to strangers. 11.
   Their inward thought is their houses for ever, [219] and their
   dwelling-places to all generations; they have called out their names
   upon the earth. 12. And man shall not abide in honour; he has become
   like the beasts: they perish.


   10 For he shall see that wise men die. I consider the ninth and tenth
   verses to be connected, and that it is the intention of the Psalmist to
   censure the folly of those who dream of spending an eternity in this
   world, and set themselves seriously to establish a permanent settlement
   in it, though they cannot but see their fellow-creatures cut down daily
   before their eyes by the stroke of death. It is a common proverb, that
   experience teaches fools, and they may be looked upon as something
   worse who will not lay to heart their mortality, when surrounded by so
   many convincing illustrations of it. This seems obviously to be the
   connection. These infatuated enemies of God, as if he had said, cannot
   fail to perceive that death is the universal lot of mankind, that the
   wise are equally liable to it with the foolish; and yet they persist in
   the imagination that they will remain here always, and will live as if
   they were never to quit with this world! They see what happens to
   others, that all, without exception or discrimination, are involved in
   the common mortality; and they must observe how often it happens that
   wealth passes into the hands of strangers The word 'chrym, acherim, I
   translate strangers, rather than others; for although it may be
   extended to successors of any kind, yet I think that the Psalmist here
   supposes the case of wealth passing into the hands of those who are not
   our natural and lawful heirs, and cannot be considered in any sense as
   representing us. Many not only die, but die childless, and their name
   becomes extinct, which is an additional ingredient of bitterness in the
   cup of the worldling. And yet all these affecting lessons of experience
   are entirely lost upon them, and they still in their secret thoughts
   fondly cherish the idea of living here for ever. The Hebrew word qrv,
   kereb, means the middle of anything; but it is taken metaphorically to
   signify the heart, or inward parts of the man. Here it denotes that
   their secret thoughts are occupied with an imaginary eternity which
   they hope to enjoy upon earth. Another and more ingenious
   interpretation has been suggested by some, that as the word
   occasionally means a tomb, the Psalmist may here be satirising those
   who think to perpetuate their memory after death by rearing expensive
   mausoleums. [220] This view of the words is strained and unnatural; and
   what immediately follows proves that the other is the most correct,
   when it is added, that worldly men call out their names upon the earth;
   that is, make every exertion in their power to win reputation amongst
   their fellow-creatures. Their desire should be to have their names
   written in the book of life, and to be blessed before God and his holy
   angels; but their ambition is of another kind -- to be renowned and
   extolled upon earth. By the expression, calling out, it is insinuated
   that the fame of ungodly men is but an empty sound. Some interpreters
   prefer reading, They have called their lands by their own names, [221]
   that they might leave some monument of themselves to posterity. But
   what the Psalmist seems chiefly to insist upon is, that they are wholly
   bent upon earthly renown.

   12 And man shall not abide in honor Having exposed the vain and
   delusory nature of the fancies entertained by the ungodly, he next
   shows that however fondly they may cherish them, they must experience
   the same fate with the beasts of the field. It is true that there is a
   great difference, so far as the soul is concerned, between man and the
   brute creation; but the Psalmist speaks of things as they appear in
   this world, and in this respect he was warranted to say of the ungodly
   that they die as the beasts. His subject does not lead him to speak of
   the world to come. He is reasoning with the children of this world, who
   have no respect to another, and no idea of a farther happiness than
   that which they enjoy here. He accordingly ridicules their folly in
   conceiving of themselves as privileged with exemption from the ordinary
   lot of humanity, and warns them that death will soon be near to humble
   their presumptuous thoughts, and put them on a level with the meanest
   of the lower creatures. This I prefer to the more ingenious
   interpretation which some would put upon the words, that they reduced
   themselves to the level of beasts by not recognising the true dignity
   of their nature, which consists in the possession of a never-dying
   soul. The Psalmist's great aim is to show the vanity of the boasting of
   the wicked, from the nearness of death, which must join them in one
   common fate with the beasts of the field. The last word in the verse
   gives the reason why the ungodly may be compared to the beasts -- they
   perish It matters little whether or not we consider the relative 'sr,
   asher, as understood, and read, that perish

   Psalm 49:13-15

   13. This their way is foolishness in them, [222] and their posterity
   will acquiesce in their sayings, [literally, in their mouth.] Selah.
   14. Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed them; and
   the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning, and their
   strength [223] shall wax old; the grave shall receive them [224] from
   their dwelling. 15. But God shall redeem my soul from the hand [225] of
   the grave; for he hath taken me up. Selah


   13 This their way is foolishness As this verse has been variously
   rendered, I shall briefly, before giving my own sense of it, state the
   views which have been taken by others. As the Hebrew word ksl, kesel,
   which I have translated foolishness, occasionally means the kidneys,
   some refine upon the term, and consider it to be here taken for fat; as
   if this imagination of theirs were, so to speak, fat which stupified
   and rendered their senses obtuse. But this reading is too forced to
   bear examination. Others read, This their way is their folly; [226]
   that is, the reason why they pursue such a line of conduct is, that
   they are destitute of sound judgment; for, were they not utterly devoid
   of it, and did they possess one spark of intelligence, would they not
   reflect upon the end for which they were created, and direct their
   minds to higher objects? I rather conceive the Psalmist simply to mean,
   that the event proves them to be wholly destitute of wisdom, in placing
   their happiness upon earthly objects, and brands them, notwithstanding
   all the pretensions they make to foresight and shrewdness, with
   ridicule and contempt. And this he states, to show in a more aggravated
   light the madness of their posterity, who will not be instructed by the
   fate of their predecessors. The last clause of the verse has also been
   variously rendered, and I may state the views which have been taken of
   it by others. The Hebrew verb rtsh, ratsah, which I have translated to
   acquiesce, they render, to walk, and the noun phy, phi, translated
   mouth or sayings, they take to mean a measure, thus understanding the
   Psalmist to say, that the children walked by the same rule with their
   fathers; and they change the letter v, beth, into k, caph, the mark of
   similitude which is sufficiently common in the Hebrew language. This
   view of the passage comes near to the proper meaning of it. Some
   conceive that there is an allusion to the beasts of the field; but this
   is improbable. It seems best to understand with others that the word
   mouth denotes principles or sayings; and the verb rtsh, ratsah, may be
   taken in its more ordinary and most generally received sense, which
   implies consent or complacency. I have therefore translated it to
   acquiesce. The boasted confidence of the ungodly proving vain in the
   issue, and exposing them justly to ridicule, it argues a monstrous
   infatuation in their posterity, with this example before their eyes, to
   set their affections upon the same trifles, and to feel and express
   themselves exactly in the same manner as those who went before them. If
   men reflect at all upon the judgments which God executes in the world,
   we might expect that they would particularly consider his dealings with
   their immediate predecessors, and when, wholly insensible to the
   lessons which should be learned from their fate, they precipitate
   themselves into the same courses, this convincingly demonstrates their
   brutish folly.

   14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed them [227]
   The figure is striking. They go down into the grave as sheep are
   gathered into the fold by the shepherd. The entire world might not seem
   vast enough for men of a haughty spirit. They are so swollen with their
   vain imaginations, that they would engross universal nature to
   themselves. But the Psalmist, finding the wicked spread as it were far
   and wide, in the boundless pride of their hearts, collects them
   together into the grave, and hands them over to death as their
   shepherd. He intimates, that whatever superiority they might affect
   over their fellow-creatures, they would feel, when too late, that their
   boasting was vain, and be forced to yield themselves up to the
   irresistible and humiliating stroke of death. In the second part of the
   verse, the Psalmist points out the very different fate which awaits the
   children of God, and thus anticipates an obvious objection. It might be
   said, "Thou tellest us that those who place their confidence in this
   world must die. But this is no new doctrine. And why convert into
   matter of reproach what must be considered as a law of nature,
   attaching to all mankind? Who gave thee a privilege to insult the
   children of mortality? Art thou not one of them thyself?" This
   objection he meets effectually, by granting that on the supposition of
   death being the destruction of the whole man, he would have advanced no
   new or important doctrine, but arguing that infidel worldlings reject a
   better life to come, and thus lay themselves justly open to this
   species of reprehension. For surely it is the height of folly in any
   man for a mere momentary happiness -- a very dream -- to abdicate the
   crown of heaven, and renounce his hopes for eternity. Here it must be
   apparent, as I already took occasion to observe, that the doctrine of
   this psalm is very different from that taught by the philosophers. I
   grant that they may have ridiculed worldly ambition with elegance and
   eloquence, exposed the other vices, and insisted upon the topics of our
   frailty and mortality; but they uniformly omitted to state the most
   important truth of all, that God governs the world by his providence,
   and that we may expect a happy issue out of our calamities, by coming
   to that everlasting inheritance which awaits us in heaven. It may be
   asked, what that dominion is which the upright shall eventually obtain?
   I would reply, that as the wicked must all be prostrated before the
   Lord Jesus Christ, and made his footstool, His members will share in
   the victory of their Head. It is indeed said, that he "will deliver up
   the kingdom to God, even the Father," but he will not do this that he
   may put an end to his Church, but "that God may be all in all," (1
   Corinthians 15:24.) It is stated that this will be in the morning [228]
   -- a beautiful and striking metaphor. Surrounded as we are by darkness,
   our life is here compared to the night, or to a sleep, an image which
   is specially applicable to the ungodly, who lie as it were in a deep
   slumber, but not inapplicable to the people of God, such being the dark
   mist which rests upon all things in this world, that even their minds
   (except in so far as they are illuminated from above) are partially
   enveloped in it. Here "we see only as through a glass darkly," and the
   coining of the Lord will resemble the morning, when both the elect and
   reprobate will awake. The former will then cast aside their lethargy
   and sloth, and being freed from the darkness which rested upon them,
   will behold Christ the Sun of Righteousness face to face, and the full
   effulgence of life which resides in him. The others, who lie at present
   in a state of total darkness, will be aroused from their stupidity, and
   begin to discover a new life, of which they had previously no
   apprehension. We need to be reminded of this event, not only because
   corruption presses us downwards and obscures our faith, but because
   there are men who profanely argue against another life, from the
   continued course of things in the world, scoffing, as Peter foretold,
   (2 Peter 3:4,) at the promise of a resurrection, and pointing, in
   derision, to the unvarying regularity of nature throughout the lapse of
   ages. We may arm ourselves against their arguments by what the Psalmist
   here declares, that, sunk as the world is in darkness, there will dawn
   ere long a new morning, which will introduce us to a better and an
   eternal existence. It follows, that their strength, or their form,
   [229] (for the Hebrew word tsvrh, tsurah, is susceptible of either
   meanings) shall wax old If we read strength, the words intimate, that
   though at present they are in possession of wealth and power, they
   shall speedily decline and fall; but I see no objection to the other
   meaning, which has more commonly been adopted. Paul tells us, (1
   Corinthians 7:31,) that "the fashion of this world passes away," a term
   expressive of the evanescent nature of our earthly condition; and the
   Psalmist may be considered as comparing their vain and unsubstantial
   glory to a shadow. The words at the close of the verse are obscure.
   Some read, The grave is their dwelling; and then they make m, mem, the
   formative letter of a noun. But the other interpretation agrees better
   both with the words and scope of the psalm, that the grave awaits them
   from his dwelling, which is put for their dwelling; such a change of
   number being common in the Hebrew language. They reside at present in
   splendid mansions, where they rest in apparent security, but we are
   reminded that they must soon come out of them, and be received into the
   tomb. There may be a covert allusion to their goings abroad to places
   of public resort with gaiety and pomp. These, the Psalmist intimates,
   must give place to the sad procession by which they must be carried
   down to the grave.

   15 But God will redeem my soul The Hebrew particle, 'k, ach, may be
   also translated, surely, or certainly. The psalmist had made a general
   assertion of the great truth, that the righteous shall have dominion in
   the morning, and now he applies it to himself for the confirmation of
   his own faith. This verse may, therefore, be regarded as a kind of
   appendix to the former; in it he makes a personal application of what
   had been said of all the righteous. By the word, the hand, is to be
   understood the dominion and power, and not the stroke, of the grave, as
   some have rendered it. The prophet does not deny his liability to
   death; but he looks to God as He who would defend and redeem him from
   it. We have here a convincing proof of that faith in which the saints
   under the Law lived and died. It is evident that their views were
   directed to another and a higher life, to which the present was only
   preparatory. Had the prophet merely intended to intimate that he
   expected deliverance from some ordinary emergency, this would have been
   no more than what is frequently done by the children of the world, whom
   God often delivers from great dangers. But here it is evident that he
   hoped for a life beyond the grave, that he extended his glance beyond
   this sublunary sphere, and anticipated the morning which will introduce
   eternity. From this we may conclude, that the promises of the Law were
   spiritual, and that our fathers who embraced them were willing to
   confess themselves pilgrims upon earth, and sought an inheritance in
   heaven. It evinced gross stupidity in the Sadducees, educated as they
   were under the Law, to conceive of the soul as mortal. The man must be
   blind indeed who can find no mention of a future life in this passage.
   To what other interpretation can we wrest the preceding verse, when it
   speaks of a morning altogether new and peculiar? We are sufficiently
   accustomed to see the return of morning, but it points us to a day of
   an extraordinary kind, when God himself shall rise upon us as the sun,
   and surprise us with the discovery of his glory. When the Psalmist
   adds, Assuredly God will redeem my soul [230] from the power of the
   grave, does he not contemplate a special privilege, such as could not
   be shared by all other men? If deliverance from death, then, be a
   privilege peculiar to the children of God, it is evident that they are
   expectants of a better life. We must not overlook, (what I have already
   noticed,) that the sure method of profiting by the divine promises is,
   to apply to ourselves what God has offered generally to all without
   exception. This is done by the prophet, for how could he have arrived
   at an assured promise of the redemption of his soul, except by the
   general fact known to him of the future glory awaiting the children of
   God, and by concluding himself to be amongst their number? The last
   clause of the verse runs in the Hebrew literally, for he will take me
   up Some, however, resolve the causal particle ky, ki, which we render
   for, into the adverb of time when, and the verb lqch, lakach, which we
   translate to receive or to take up, they translate to cut off, or take
   away from this world, giving to the passage this sense, When God shall
   have called my soul out of this world to himself, he will rescue it
   from the power of the grave. I am afraid that this is rather too
   strained an interpretation. Those seem to take a juster view of the
   words who consider that the future tense has been substituted for the
   perfect, and who retain the proper signification of the causal
   particle, reading, for he has taken me up The prophet did not consider
   that the ground of his hope for a better resurrection was to be found
   in himself, but in the gratuitous adoption of God who had taken him
   into his favor. There is no need, however, why we should suppose a
   change of tense, and not understand the Psalmist as meaning that God
   would redeem his soul from death, by undertaking the guardianship of it
   when he came to die. The despairing fears which so many entertain when
   descending to the grave spring from the fact of their not commending
   their spirit to the preserving care of God. They do not consider it in
   the light of a precious deposit which will be safe in his protecting
   hands. Let our faith be established in the great truth, that our soul,
   though it appears to evanish upon its separation from the body, is in
   reality only gathered to the bosom of God, there to be kept until the
   day of the resurrection.

   He observes, that the Hebrew word rh, raah, means to give the sheep
   pasture, or to look to them when they are feeding, Genesis 29:7, and
   30:32; and that this feeding of sheep is very different from feeding on
   them. He farther observes, that the word is frequently used for ruling

   there to continue together in a common place, so men are put into s'vl,
   hades, the state of the dead, mentioned in the former words, and to
   that regularly follows -- Death ydm, [shall feed them,] -- is as the
   shepherd that conducts or leads them into this pasture, those Elysian
   fields: -- an excellent piece of divine poesy, to signify, how men like
   sheep, like beasts, go by flocks and herds out of this life, or more
   plainly, that men die as ordinarily and regularly as sheep are led to
   their pasture." Some, however, read, "Death feedeth upon them." "rh
   signifies not only to feed, but to feed upon and lay waste; and thus we
   render it in Micah 5:6, They shall waste Assyria with the sword.' See
   also Psalm 80:14." -- Appendix to the Notes in Merrick's version, No.
   4, p. 304. This verb also signifies to feed upon in Isaiah 44:20, and
   Hosea 12:2. Fry's translation is, "They are set apart like sheep for
   Hades;
   Death feedeth upon them, and they go down to them;" and he thinks that
   the idea here is, that Death and Hades are the two monsters for whose
   consumption the flock is destined. This is a personification which we
   frequently meet with in the Latin poets. Cerberus is often represented
   by them as feasting on the bodies of men in the grave; Thus,
   notwithstanding the strong desires which worldly men have for
   immortality in this world, they shall become the victims of the grave,
   and the prey of death.

   [228] In the morning, that is, says Dathe, in the time of judgment. He
   thinks there is here an allusion to the usual time of holding courts of
   justice, which was in the morning. See Psalm 73:14, and 101:8; and
   Jeremiah 21:12.

   [229] The LXX. read, E boetheia auton, their help, conceiving the word
   tsvtm, tsuram, to be derived from tsvr, tsur, a rock, and
   metaphorically, confidence, aid Ainsworth reads, "their form," their
   figure, shape, or image, with all their beauty and proportion; or
   "their rock," that is, their strength "The Hebrew tsur," says he, "is
   usually a rock; here it seemeth to be all one with tsurah, a form or
   figure; and this is confirmed by the writing, for though by the vowels
   and reading it is tsur, yet, by the letters, it is, tsir, which is an
   image, Isaiah 45:16."

   [230] Soul is not here to be understood of the intellectual immaterial
   spirit. The Hebrew word nphsy, naphshi, my soul, is often put in the
   Old Testament Scriptures for the personal pronoun; and thus it means my
   person, myself, me. -- [8]See Appendix., Note on Psalm 16:10.

   Psalm 49:16-20

   16. Be not thou afraid when one shall be made rich, when the glory of
   his house shall be increased; 17. For when he dieth he shall not carry
   all away: his glory shall not descend after him: 18. For he will bless
   his soul in his lifetime, and they shall praise thee when thou doest
   well to thyself. [231] 19. He shall come but to the age of his fathers,
   and will not see the light even for ever. 20. Man is in honour, and
   will not understand: he is like the beasts: they shall perish.


   16 Be not thou afraid The Psalmist repeats, in the form of an
   exhortation, the same sentiment which he had formerly expressed, that
   the children of God have no reason to dread the wealth and power of
   their enemies, or to envy their evanescent prosperity; and as the best
   preservative against despondency, he would have them to direct their
   eyes habitually to the end of life. The effect of such a contemplation
   will be at once to check any impatience we might be apt to feel under
   our short-lived miseries, and to raise our minds in holy contempt above
   the boasted but delusory grandeur of the wicked. That this may not
   impose upon our minds, the prophet recalls us to the consideration of
   the subject of death -- that event which is immediately at hand, and
   which no sooner arrives than it strips them of their false glory, and
   consigns them to the tomb. So much is implied in the words, He shall
   not carry away all these things when he dieth [232] Be their lives ever
   so illustrious in the eyes of their fellow-creatures, this glory is
   necessarily bounded by the present world. The same truth is further
   asserted in the succeeding clause of the verse, His glory shall not
   descend after him Infatuated men may strain every nerve, as if in
   defiance of the very laws of nature, to perpetuate their glory after
   death, but they never can escape the corruption and nakedness of the
   tomb; for, in the language of the poet Juvenal, -

   "Mots sola fatetur Quantula sint hominum corpuscula," --

   "It is death which forces us to confess how worthless the bodies of men
   are."

   18 For he will bless his soul in his lifetime Various meanings have
   been attached to this verse. Some read, He ought to have blessed his
   soul during his life Others apply the first clause of the verse to the
   wicked, while they refer the second to believers, who are in the habit
   of praising God for all his benefits. Others understand the whole verse
   as descriptive of believers, but without sufficient ground. There can
   be little doubt that the reference is to the children of the world. In
   the first part of the verse it is said that they bless their own soul
   [233] so long as they live on earth, by which is meant, that they
   indulge and pamper themselves with earthly pleasures, giving way to the
   excesses of brutish intemperance, like the rich man, of whom Christ
   spoke in the parable, who said,

   "Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years, take thine ease,
   eat, drink, and be merry," -- (Luke 12:19)

   or that they seek their happiness entirely from this world, without
   cherishing a desire for the life that is to come. Some translate the
   Hebrew verb, he will do good, and read thus, He will do good to his own
   soul in his lifetime. But I conceive the phrase to be synonymous in its
   import with that which is employed by Moses,

   "And it come to pass, that he bless himself in his heart;"
   (Deuteronomy 29:19,)

   that is, flatter himself as if he might despise God with impunity. The
   inspired penman here represents the stupidity of such as please
   themselves with a fallacious dream of happiness. In the latter part of
   the verse the person is changed, and the votary of pleasure is
   apostrophised; [234] the prophet insinuating, by the words he uses,
   that the preposterous pride with which the wicked are inflamed is in
   part the consequence of the delusive applause of the world, which
   pronounces them to be happy, and echoes their praises even when they
   gratify their most unlicensed passions.

   19 He shall come to the age of his fathers He proceeds to show how
   false are the flatteries by which the wicked deceive themselves, and
   are deceived by others. Be they ever so intoxicated with the praises of
   the world, or with their own vain imaginations, yet they cannot live
   beyond the age of their fathers; and, granting their life to be
   extended to the longest term, it can never stretch into eternity.
   Others understand the expression as synonymous with their being
   gathered to the tomb along with their fathers who have gone before
   them; as in Scripture death is usually called "The way of all the
   earth." The Psalmist, a little above, had spoken of their being
   gathered together in the grave as sheep in a fold. According to this
   view, the meaning of the passage is, that having never aspired after
   heaven, but having been sunk in the low grovelling pursuits of this
   world, they would come at last to the same fate with their fathers.
   When it is added, They shall not see the light even for ever, we are to
   understand their consignment to everlasting darkness. [235] In my
   opinion, both clauses of the verse combine to express the same truth,
   That however they may flatter and deceive themselves, they cannot
   prolong their life beyond the common term of mortality. As either
   interpretation, however, agrees with the general scope of the psalm,
   the reader may choose for himself. Should the latter be adopted, the
   words in the close of the verse are to be considered as asserting that
   the ungodly can only enjoy the light of life for a short period, as
   they have no hope of another existence beyond the grave. We are taught
   by the Psalmist, in the words which have been under our consideration,
   to beware of flattering ourselves in the possessions of this world, and
   to be principally anxious for the attainment of that happiness which is
   reserved for us in heaven. We are also warned not to allow ourselves to
   be carried away by the erring influence of worldly applause. Even
   heathen authors have taught us the same lesson. Thus the poet Persius
   says, --

   "Non si quid turbida Roma
   Elevet, accedas, examenve improbum in illa
   Castiges trutina: nec te quaesiveris extra," --

   "If Rome, a city full of commotions, exalt or despise any thing, beware
   of being satisfied with its weight or balance; that is to say, of
   stopping at its judgment; and do not look to what others say of you,
   but enter into thyself, and examine what thou art." [236] But the
   disposition to be deceived by flattery is one so strongly marked in our
   nature, as to require that we should attend to the weightier admonition
   of one who was inspired.

   20 Man is in honor, and will not understand [237] Here the prophet,
   that he may not be understood as having represented the present life,
   which in itself is a singular blessing of God, as wholly contemptible,
   corrects himself as it were, or qualifies his former statements by a
   single word, importing that those whom he reprehends have reduced
   themselves to the level of the beasts that perish, by senselessly
   devouring the blessings which God has bestowed, and thus divesting
   themselves of that honor which God had put upon them. It is against the
   abuse of this world that the prophet has been directing his censures.
   They are aimed at those who riot in the bounties of God without any
   recognition of God himself, and who devote themselves in an infatuated
   manner to the passing glory of this world, instead of rising from it to
   the contemplation of the things which are above.

   [231] French and Skinner read, "Yea, though men praise thee when thou
   indulgest thyself;" and they explain men to mean "parasites and
   flatterers," and "indulgest thyself" as meaning, "indulgest thyself in
   unrestrained luxury."

   [234] "There is here a change," says Walford, "from the oblique to the
   direct form of speech, by which the writer turns himself to the rich
   man, who prospers in the world, and says to him, Though you now count
   yourself happy, and meet with applause from persons of a character
   resembling your own, yet you shall go to the abode of your fathers, who
   will never behold the light." He reads the 19th verse, "Thou shalt go
   to the abode of thy fathers, who will never behold the light."

   [235] Horsley reads, "To all eternity they shall not see light;" "that
   light," says he, "which emphatically deserves the name -- that light,
   of which created light is but a faint image; the light of God's glory.
   He shall have no share in the beatific vision."

   [236] This is the translation which is given of these lines in the
   French version.

   [237] This verse is precisely the same as the 12th, with the exception
   of one word. Instead of vl-ylyn, bal-yalin, will not lodge, in the 12th
   verse, we have here vl' yvyn, velo yabin, and will not understand But
   the Septuagint and Syriac versions read in the 12th verse as here,
   "understands not." Houbigant thinks that this is the true reading of
   the 12th verse. "The very repetition," says he, "proves that it is to
   be so read. Besides, as the Psalmist immediately subjoins, They are
   like brute creatures, it is sufficiently evident that the reason why
   men are said to be like the beasts is, because they do not understand,
   and not because they do not continue in honor, since honor does not
   belong to the brute creation."

   [207] Ten psalms bear the inscription, "Of or for the sons of Korah."
   As the prefixed preposition l may be translated either of or for, it
   has been doubted whether this and other psalms, with a similar
   inscription, were written by or for the sons of Korah. Some, as Calmet,
   think it most probable that they were composed by them, from certain
   peculiarities of style in which they agree with each other, and differ
   from the psalms which bear the name of David. Others ascribe these
   psalms to David, and suppose that they were committed by him to the
   chief musician, to be sung by the posterity of Korah.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PSALM 50

   There have always been hypocrites in the Church, men who have placed
   religion in a mere observance of outward ceremonies, and among the Jews
   there were many who turned their attention entirely to the figures of
   the Law, without regarding the truth which was represented under them.
   They conceived that nothing more was demanded of them but their
   sacrifices and other rites. The following psalm is occupied with the
   reprehension of this gross error, and the prophet exposes in severe
   terms the dishonor which is cast upon the name of God by confounding
   ceremony with religion, showing that the worship of God is spiritual,
   and consists of two parts, prayer and thanksgiving.

   A Song of Asaph. [238]

   The prophet holds up the ingratitude of such persons to our
   reprobation, as proving themselves unworthy of the honor which has been
   placed upon them, and debasing themselves by a degenerate use of this
   world. From this let us learn, that if we are miserable here, it must
   be by our own fault; for could we discern and properly improve the many
   mercies which God has bestowed upon us, we would not want, even on
   earth, a foretaste of eternal blessedness. Of this, however we fall
   short through our corruption. The wicked, even while on earth, have a
   pre-eminency over the beasts of the field in reason and intelligence,
   which form a part of the image of God; but in reference to the end
   which awaits them the prophet puts both upon a level, and declares,
   that being divested of all their vain-glory, they will eventually
   perish like the beasts. Their souls will indeed survive, but it is not
   the less true that death will consign them to everlasting disgrace.

   Psalm 50:1-5

   1. The God of gods, even Jehovah, hath spoken, and called the earth
   [239] from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. 2. Out of
   Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined. 3. Our God shall come,
   and shall not keep silence; a fire shall devour before him, and it
   shall be very tempestuous round about him. 4. He shall call to the
   heavens from above, and to the earth to judge his people. 5. Gather my
   meek ones (will he say [240] ) together unto me, those who strike a
   covenant with me over sacrifices.


   1. The God of gods, even Jehovah, [241] hath spoken The inscription of
   this psalm bears the name of Asaph; but whether he was the author of
   it, or merely received it as chief singer from the hand of David,
   cannot be known. This, however, is a matter of little consequence. The
   opinion has been very generally entertained, that the psalm points to
   the period of the Church's renovation, and that the design of the
   prophet is to apprise the Jews of the coming abrogation of their
   figurative worship under the Law. That the Jews were subjected to the
   rudiments of the world, which continued till the Church's majority, and
   the arrival of what the apostle calls "the fullness of times,"
   (Galatians 4:4,) admits of no doubt; the only question is, whether the
   prophet must here be considered as addressing the men of his own age,
   and simply condemning the abuse and corruption of the legal worship, or
   as predicting the future kingdom of Christ? From the scope of the
   psalm, it is sufficiently apparent that the prophet does in fact
   interpret the Law to his contemporaries, with a view of showing them
   that the ceremonies, while they existed, were of no importance whatever
   by themselves, or otherwise than connected with a higher meaning. Is it
   objected, that God never called the whole world except upon the
   promulgation of the Gospel, and that the doctrine of the Law was
   addressed only to one peculiar people? the answer is obvious, that the
   prophet in this place describes the whole world as convened not for the
   purpose of receiving one common system of faith, but of hearing God
   plead his cause with the Jews in its presence. The appeal is of a
   parallel nature with others which we find in Scripture:

   "Give ear, O ye heavens! and I will speak; and hear, O earth! the words
   of my mouths" (Deuteronomy 32:1;)

   or as in another place,

   "I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have
   set before you life and death," (Deuteronomy 30:19;)

   and again Isaiah,

   "Hear, O heaven! and give ear, O earth! for the Lord hath spoken,"
   (Isaiah 1:2.) [242]

   This vehement mode of address was required in speaking to hypocrites,
   that they might be roused from their complacent security, and their
   serious attention engaged to the message of God. The Jews had special
   need to be awakened upon the point to which reference is here made. Men
   are naturally disposed to outward show in religion, and, measuring God
   by themselves, imagine that an attention to ceremonies constitutes the
   sum of their duty. There was a strong disposition among the Jews to
   rest in an observance of the figures of the Law, and it is well known
   with what severity the prophets all along reprehended this
   superstition, by which the worst and most abandoned characters were led
   to arrogate a claim to piety, and hide their abominations under the
   specious garb of godliness. The prophet, therefore, required to do more
   than simply expose the defective nature of that worship which withdraws
   the attention of men from faith and holiness of heart to outward
   ceremonies; it was necessary that, in order to check false confidence
   and banish insensibility, he should adopt the style of severe reproof.
   God is here represented as citing all the nations of the earth to his
   tribunal, not with the view of prescribing the rule of piety to an
   assembled world, or collecting a church for his service, but with the
   design of alarming the hypocrite, and terrifying him out of his
   self-complacency. It would serve as a spur to conviction, thus to be
   made aware that the whole world was summoned as a witness to their
   dissimulation, and that they would be stripped of that pretended piety
   of which they were disposed to boast. It is with a similar object that
   he addresses Jehovah as the God of gods, to possess their minds with a
   salutary terror, and dissuade them from their vain attempts to elude
   his knowledge. That this is his design will be made still more apparent
   from the remaining context, where we are presented with a formidable
   description of the majesty of God, intended to convince the hypocrite
   of the vanity of those childish trifles with which he would evade the
   scrutiny of so great and so strict a judge.

   To obviate an objection which might be raised against his doctrine in
   this psalm, that it was subversive of the worship prescribed by Moses,
   the prophet intimates that this judgment which he announced would be in
   harmony with the Law. When God speaks out of Zion he necessarily
   sanctions the authority of the Law; and the Prophets, when at any time
   they make use of this form of speech, declare themselves to be
   interpreters of the Law. That holy mountain was not chosen of man's
   caprice, and therefore stands identified with the Law. The prophet thus
   cuts off any pretext which the Jews might allege to evade his doctrine,
   by announcing that such as concealed their wickedness, under the
   specious covert of ceremonies, would not be condemned of God by any new
   code of religion, but by that which was ministered originally by Moses.
   He gives Zion the honorable name of the perfection of beauty, because
   God had chosen it for his sanctuary, the place where his name should be
   invoked, and where his glory should be manifested in the doctrine of
   the Law.

   3. Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence [243] He repeats that
   God would come, in order to confirm his doctrine, and more effectually
   arouse them. He would come, and should not always keep silence, lest
   they should be encouraged to presume upon his forbearance. Two reasons
   may be assigned why the prophet calls God our God He may be considered
   as setting himself, and the comparatively small number of the true
   fearers of the Lord, in opposition to the hypocrites whom he abhors,
   claiming God to be his God, and not theirs, as they were disposed to
   boast; or rather, he speaks as one of the people, and declares that the
   God who was coming to avenge the corruptions of his worship was the
   same God whom all the children of Abraham professed to serve. He who
   shall come, as if he had said, is our God, the same in whom we glory,
   who established his covenant with Abraham, and gave us his Law by the
   hand of Moses. He adds, that God would come with fire and tempest, in
   order to awaken a salutary fear in the secure hearts of the Jews, that
   they might learn to tremble at the judgments of God, which they had
   hitherto regarded with indifference and despised, and in allusion to
   the awful manifestation which God made of himself from Sinai, (Exodus
   19:16; see also Hebrews 12:18.) The air upon that occasion resounded
   with thunders and the noise of trumpets, the heavens were illuminated
   with lightnings, and the mountain was in flames, it being the design of
   God to procure a reverential submission to the Law which he announced.
   And it is here intimated, that God would make a similarly terrific
   display of his power, in coming to avenge the gross abuses of his holy
   religion.

   4. He shall call to the heavens from above It is plain from this verse
   for what purpose God, as he had already announced, would call upon the
   earth. This was to witness the settlement of his controversy with his
   own people the Jews, against whom judgment was to be pronounced, not in
   the ordinary manner as by his prophets, but with great solemnity before
   the whole world. The prophet warns the hypocritical that they must
   prepare to be driven from their hiding-place, that their cause would be
   decided in the presence of men and angels, and that they would he
   dragged without excuse before that dreadful assembly. It may be asked,
   why the prophet represents the true fearers of the Lord as cited to his
   bar, when it is evident that the remonstrance which follows in the
   psalm is addressed to the hypocritical and degenerate portion of the
   Jews? To this I answer, that God here speaks of the whole Church, for
   though a great part of the race of Abraham had declined from the piety
   of their ancestors, yet he has a respect to the Jewish Church, as being
   his own institution. He speaks of them as his meek ones, to remind them
   of what they ought to be in consistency with their calling, and not as
   if they were all without exception patterns of godliness. The form of
   the address conveys a rebuke to those amongst them whose real character
   was far from corresponding with their profession. Others have suggested
   a more refined interpretation, as if the meaning were, Separate the
   small number of my sincere worshippers from the promiscuous multitude
   by whom my name is profaned, lest they too should afterwards be seduced
   to a vain religion of outward form. I do not deny that this agrees with
   the scope of the prophet. But I see no reason why a church, however
   universally corrupted, provided it contain a few godly members, should
   not be denominated, in honor of this remnant, the holy people of God.
   Interpreters have differed upon the last clause of the verse: Those who
   strike a covenant with me over sacrifices, Some think over is put for
   besides, or beyond, and that God commends his true servants for this,
   that they acknowledged something more to be required in his covenant
   than an observance of outward ceremonies, and were not chargeable with
   resting in the carnal figures of the Law. [244] Others think that the
   spiritual and true worship of God is here directly opposed to
   sacrifices; as if it had been said, Those who, instead of sacrifices,
   keep my covenant in the right and appointed manner, by yielding to me
   the sincere homage of their heart. But in my opinion, the prophet is
   here to be viewed as pointing out with commendation the true and
   genuine use of the legal worship; for it was of the utmost consequence
   that it should be known what was the real end for which God appointed
   sacrifices under the Law. The prophet here declares that sacrifices
   were of no value whatever except as seals of God's covenant, an
   interpretative handwriting of submission to it, or in general as means
   employed for ratifying it. There is an allusion to the custom then
   universally prevalent of interposing sacrifices, that covenants might
   be made more solemn, and be more religiously observed. [245] In like
   manner, the design with which sacrifices were instituted by God was to
   bind his people more closely to himself, and to ratify and confirm his
   covenant. The passage is well worthy of our particular notice, as
   defining those who are to be considered the true members of the Church.
   They are such, on the one hand, as are characterised by the spirit of
   meekness, practising righteousness in their intercourse with the world;
   and such, on the other, as close in the exercise of a genuine faith
   with the covenant of adoption which God has proposed to them. This
   forms the true worship of God, as he has himself delivered it to us
   from heaven; and those who decline from it, whatever pretensions they
   may make to be considered a church of God, are excommunicated from it
   by the Holy Spirit. As to sacrifices or other ceremonies, they are of
   no value, except in so far as they seal to us the pure truth of God.
   All such rites, consequently, as have no foundation in the word of God,
   are unauthorised, and that worship which has not a distinct reference
   to the word is but a corruption of things sacred.

   [239] That is, the inhabitants of the earth.

   [240] ("Dira-il.") -- Fr.

   [241] The original words here rendered "The God of gods, even Jehovah,"
   are 'l 'lhym yhvh, E1 Elohim Yehovah Each of these words is a name of
   the Divine Being. The first has reference to the power of the Deity; so
   that it might be translated, "The Mighty One." If we read 'l 'lhym, El
   Elohim, together, and translate "The God of gods," this is a Hebrewism
   for "Most mighty God;" the word 'lhym, Elohim, being placed after the
   name of any thing to express its excellency, greatness, or might. See
   [10]p. 7, note 1, of this volume. Comp. Deuteronomy 10:17; Joshua
   22:22; and Daniel 11:36. Horsley reads, "The omnipotent God Jehovah
   hath spoken." The reading of the Chaldee is, "The mighty One, the God
   Jehovah." The prophet has here joined together these three names of
   God, to give to the Israelites a more impressive idea of the greatness
   of Him who, now seated on his throne, and surrounded with awful
   majesty, was about to plead his controversy with them.

   [242] "The Targum, Kimchi, and R. Obediah Gaon, interpret this psalm of
   the day of judgment, and Jarchi takes it to be a prophecy of the
   redemption by their future Messiah." -- Dr Gill. Dr Adam Clarke
   explains it in the first of these senses; observing, that "to any minor
   consideration or fact it seems impossible with any propriety to
   restrain it." It appears, however, as Calvin holds, to be rather the
   aim and intention of the poem to teach the utter uselessness of all
   outward ceremonies in the absence of inward piety; and it is
   constructed on the plan of a dramatic performance, the sole actor being
   Jehovah seated on his throne in Zion, and the audience being the whole
   world, who are summoned to be witnesses of the judgment which he is to
   execute upon his people. This is the view taken by Bishop Lowth in his
   Lectures on Sacred Poetry, volume 2, p. 235. Walford gives the same
   interpretation. "To interpret this passage," says he, "of the
   promulgation of the Gospel, as is done by Bishop Horne and other
   expositors of this book, is for the sake of a favorite theory to
   confound things that are distinct, and to throw obscurity over the
   whole, by which its specific design is darkened, and the poem deprived
   of its consistency and unity. The great purpose of the psalm is to
   deliver the judgment of God respecting the Jewish people; and heaven
   and earth are summoned, as in Isaiah 1:2, to behold the righteousness
   of Jehovah, and bear their testimony to it."

   [243] This negative form of expression is employed to give greater
   emphasis.

   [244] In Luther's German translation of the Bible this verse is
   rendered, "Gather me mine holy ones,
   That regard the covenant more than offering."

   [245] The manner in which covenants were anciently ratified by
   sacrifices was this: The victim was cut into two parts, and each half
   was placed upon an altar. The contracting parties then passed between
   the pieces, which was a kind of imprecation upon the party who should
   violate the covenant, being as much as to say, May he or they be cut
   asunder like that dissected victim. In this manner, the covenant which
   God made with Abraham and his family was ratified, Genesis 15:9, 17,
   18. This awful ceremony was also observed by God's ancient people at
   the renovation of the covenant, as appears from Jeremiah 34:18. See
   also a covenant between God and his people with sacrifices in Exodus
   24:4-8. This explains the phrase here used, which is literally, "Those
   who have cut a covenant with me by sacrifice," the verb being from krt,
   carath, he cut The same mode of ratifying covenants prevailed among
   some of the heathen nations, as appears from the allusions made to it
   by Homer and Virgil, Iliad, lib. 19, 50, 260; Æneid, lib. 12, 50, 292.

   Psalm 50:6-13

   6. And the heavens shall declare his righteousness, for God is judge
   himself. Selah. 7. Hear, O my people! and I will speak; O Israel! and I
   will announce to thee: I am God, even thy God. 8. I will not reprove
   thee for thy sacrifices, and thy burnt offerings are continually before
   me. 9. I will take no calf out of thy house, nor he-goats out of thy
   folds. 10. For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a
   thousand hills. 11. I know all the fowls of the mountains; and the wild
   beasts of the field are at my command. 12. If I am hungry, I will not
   tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof. 13. Will I
   eat the flesh of bulls, [246] and drink the blood of goats?


   6. And the heavens shall declare his righteousness. The Jews were vain
   enough to imagine that their idle and fantastic service was the
   perfection of righteousness; but they are here warned by the prophet,
   that God, who had seemed to connive at their folly, was about to reveal
   his own righteousness from heaven, and expose their miserable devices.
   "Think you," as if he had said, "that God can take delight in the
   mockery of your deluded services? Though you send up the smoke of them
   to heaven, God will make known his righteousness in due time from
   above, and vindicate it from the dishonors done to it by your wicked
   inventions. The heavens themselves will attest your perfidy in
   despising true holiness, and corrupting the pure worship of God. He
   will no longer suffer your gratuitous aspersions of his character, as
   if he took no notice of the enmity which lurks under your pretended
   friendship." There is thus a cogency in the prophet's manner of
   treating his subject. Men are disposed to admit that God is judge, but,
   at the same time, to fabricate excuses for evading his judgment, and it
   was therefore necessary that the sentence which God was about to
   pronounce should be vindicated from the vain cavils which might be
   brought against it.

   7. Hear, O my people! and I will speak. Hitherto the prophet has spoken
   as the herald of God, throwing out several expressions designed to
   alarm the minds of those whom he addressed. But from this to the end of
   the psalm God himself is introduced as the speaker; and to show the
   importance of the subject, he uses additional terms to awaken
   attention, calling them his own people, that he might challenge the
   higher authority to his words, and intimating, that the following
   address is not of a mere ordinary description, but an expostulation
   with them for the infraction of his covenant. Some read, I will testify
   against thee. But the reference, as we may gather from the common usage
   of Scripture, seems rather to be to a discussion of mutual claims. God
   would remind them of his covenant, and solemnly exact from them, as his
   chosen people, what was due according to the terms of it. He announces
   himself to be the God of Israel, that he may recall them to allegiance
   and subjection, and the repetition of his name is emphatical: as if he
   had said, When you would have me to submit to your inventions, how far
   is this audacity from that honor and reverence which belong to me? I am
   God, and therefore my majesty ought to repress presumption, and make
   all flesh keep silence when I speak; and among you, to whom I have made
   myself known as your God, I have still stronger claims to homage.

   8 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices, etc. God now proceeds to
   state the charge which he adduced against them. He declares, that he
   attached no value whatsoever to sacrifices in themselves considered.
   Not that he asserts this rite of the Jews to have been vain and
   useless, for in that case it never would have been instituted by God;
   but there is this difference betwixt religious exercises and others,
   that they can only meet the approbation of God when performed in their
   true spirit and meaning. On any other supposition they are deservedly
   rejected. Similar language we will find employed again and again by the
   prophets, as I have remarked in other places, and particularly in
   connection with the fortieth psalm. Mere outward ceremonies being
   therefore possessed of no value, God repudiates the idea that he had
   ever insisted upon them as the main thing in religion, or designed that
   they should be viewed in any other light than as helps to spiritual
   worship. Thus in Jeremiah 7:22, he denies that he had issued any
   commandment regarding sacrifices; and the prophet Micah says,

   "Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands
   of rivers of oil? and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do
   justly, and to love mercy?" -- (Micah 6:7)

   "I desire mercy," he says in another place, (Hosea 6:6,) "and not
   sacrifice." The same doctrine is every where declared by the prophets.
   I might refer especially to the prophecies of Isaiah, chapter 1:12;
   58:1, 2; 66:3. The sacrifices of the ungodly are not only represented
   as worthless and rejected by the Lord, but as peculiarly calculated to
   provoke his anger. Where a right use has been made of the institution,
   and they have been observed merely as ceremonies for the confirmation
   and increase of faith, then they are described as being essentially
   connected with true religion; but when offered without faith, or, what
   is still worse, under the impression of their meriting the favor of God
   for such as continue in their sins, they are reprobated as a mere
   profanation of divine worship. It is evident, then, what God means when
   he says, I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices; he looked to
   something beyond these. The last clause of the verse may be understood
   as asserting that their burnt-offerings were before the eyes of the
   Lord to the producing even of satiety and disgust, as we find him
   saying, (Isaiah 1:13,) that they were "an abomination unto him." There
   are some, however, who consider the negative in the beginning of the
   verse as applying to both clauses, and that God here declares that he
   did not design to reckon with them for any want of regularity in the
   observance of their sacrifices. It has been well suggested by some,
   that the relative may be understood, Thy burnt-offerings which are
   continually before me; as if he had said, According to the Law these
   are imperative; but I will bring no accusation against you at this time
   for omitting your sacrifices. [247]

   9 I will take no calf out thy house Two reasons are given in this and
   the succeeding verses to prove that he cannot set any value upon
   sacrifices. The first is, that supposing him to depend upon these, he
   needs not to be indebted for them to man, having all the fullness of
   the earth at his command; and the second, that he requires neither food
   nor drink as we do for the support of our infirm natures. Upon the
   first of these he insists in the ninth and three following verses,
   where he adverts to his own boundless possessions, that he may show his
   absolute independence of human offerings. He then points at the wide
   distinction betwixt himself and man, the latter being dependent for a
   frail subsistence upon meat and drink, while he is the self-existent
   One, and communicates life to all beside. There may be nothing new in
   the truths here laid down by the Psalmist; but, considering the strong
   propensity we have by nature to form our estimate of God from
   ourselves, and to degenerate into a carnal worship, they convey a
   lesson by no means unnecessary, and which contains profound wisdom,
   that man can never benefit God by any of his services, as we have seen
   in Psalm 16:2, "My goodness extendeth not unto thee." In the second
   place, God says that he does not require any thing for his own us but
   that, as he is sufficient in his own perfection, he has consulted the
   good of man in all that he has enjoined. We have a passage in Isaiah to
   a similar effect,

   "The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the
   house that ye build unto me, and where is the place of my rest? For all
   these things hath mine hand made." -- (Isaiah 66:1, 2,)

   In these words

   God asserts his absolute independence; for while the world had a
   beginning, he himself was from eternity. From this it follows, that as
   he subsisted when there was nothing without him which could contribute
   to his fullness, he must have in himself a glorious all-sufficiency.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [246] In explanation of this, Martin observes, "Le feu descendu du
   ciel," etc.; i.e., "The fire which descended from heaven upon the
   sacrifices was considered mystically as the mouth of God which devoured
   the flesh of the victims; and it was on that account that God had
   expressly forbidden to consume them by fire brought elsewhere, because
   this strange fire, not being that which descended from heaven, could
   not be regarded mystically as the mouth of God."

   [247] "I do not well see how it (verse 8th) can be translated otherwise
   than Leusden has done it." -- Dr Lowth. Leusden translates it thus: --
   "Non super sacrificia tua arguam te, et holocausta tua coram me sunt
   semper." -- Merrick's Annotations. Dr Adam Clarke explains the verse as
   follows: -- "I do not mean to find fault with you for not offering
   sacrifices; you have offered them; they have been continually before
   me; but you have not offered them in the proper way."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 50:14-15

   14. Sacrifice unto God praise, [248] and pay thy vows [249] unto the
   Most High. 15. And call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver
   thee, and thou shalt glorify me.


   These verses cast light upon the preceding context. Had it been stated
   in unqualified terms that sacrifices were of no value, we might have
   been perplexed to know why in that case they were instituted by God;
   but the difficulty disappears when we perceive that they are spoken of
   only in comparison with the true worship of God. From this we infer,
   that when properly observed, they were far from incurring divine
   condemnation. There is in all men by nature a strong and ineffaceable
   conviction that they ought to worship God. Indisposed to worship him in
   a pure and spiritual manner, it becomes necessary that they should
   invent some specious appearance as a substitute; and however clearly
   they may be persuaded of the vanity of such conduct, they persist in it
   to the last, because they shrink from a total renunciation of the
   service of God. Men have always, accordingly, been found addicted to
   ceremonies until they have been brought to the knowledge of that which
   constitutes true and acceptable religion. Praise and prayer are here to
   be considered as representing the whole of the worship of God,
   according to the figure synecdoche. The Psalmist specifies only one
   part of divine worship, when he enjoins us to acknowledge God as the
   Author of all our mercies, and to ascribe to him the praise which is
   justly due unto his name: and adds, that we should betake ourselves to
   his goodness, cast all our cares into his bosom, and seek by prayer
   that deliverance which he alone can give, and thanks for which must
   afterwards be rendered to him. Faith, self-denial, a holy life, and
   patient endurance of the cross, are all sacrifices which please God.
   But as prayer is the offspring of faith, and uniformly accompanied with
   patience and mortification of sin, while praise, where it is genuine,
   indicates holiness of heart, we need not wonder that these two points
   of worship should here be employed to represent the whole. Praise and
   prayer are set in opposition to ceremonies and mere external
   observances of religion, to teach us, that the worship of God is
   spiritual. Praise is first mentioned, and this might seem an inversion
   of natural order. But in reality it may be ranked first without any
   violation of propriety. An ascription to God of the honor due unto his
   name lies at the foundation of all prayer, and application to him as
   the fountain of goodness is the most elementary exercise of faith.
   Testimonies of his goodness await us ere yet we are born into the
   world, and we may therefore be said to owe the debt of gratitude before
   we are called to the necessity of supplication. Could we suppose men to
   come into the world in the full exercise of reason and judgment, their
   first act of spiritual sacrifice should be that of thanksgiving. There
   is no necessity, however, for exercising our ingenuity in defense of
   the order here adopted by the Psalmist, it being quite sufficient to
   hold that he here, in a general and popular manner, describes the
   spiritual worship of God as consisting in praise, prayer, and
   thanksgiving. In the injunction here given, to pay our vows, there is
   an allusion to what was in use under the ancient dispensation,

   "What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me? I
   will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord."
   Psalm 116:12, 13

   What the words inculcate upon the Lord's people is, in short,
   gratitude, which they were then in the habit of testifying by solemn
   sacrifices. But we shall now direct our attention more particularly to
   the important point of the doctrine which is set before us in this
   passage. And the first thing deserving our notice is, that the Jews, as
   well as ourselves, were enjoined to yield a spiritual worship to God.
   Our Lord, when he taught that this was the only acceptable species of
   worship, rested his proof upon the one argument, that "God is a
   spirit," (John 4:24.) He was no less a spirit, however, under the
   period of the legal ceremonies than after they were abolished; and
   must, therefore, have demanded then the same mode of worship which he
   now enjoins. It is true that he subjected the Jews to the ceremonial
   yoke, but in this he had a respect to the age of the Church; as
   afterwards, in the abrogation of it, he had an eye to our advantage. In
   every essential respect the worship was the same. The distinction was
   one entirely of outward form, God accommodating himself to their weaker
   and unripe apprehensions by the rudiments of ceremony, while he has
   extended a simple form of worship to us who have attained a maturer age
   since the coming of Christ. In himself there is no alteration. The idea
   entertained by the Manicheans, that the change of dispensation
   necessarily inferred a change in God himself, was as absurd as it would
   be to arrive at a similar conclusion from the periodical alterations of
   the seasons. These outward rites are, therefore, in themselves of no
   importance, and acquire it only in so far as they are useful in
   confirming our faith, so that we may call upon the name of the Lord
   with a pure heart. The Psalmist, therefore, justly denounces the
   hypocrites who gloried in their ostentatious services, and declares
   that they observed them in vain. It may occur to some, that as
   sacrifices sustained a necessary place under the Law, they could not be
   warrantably neglected by the Jewish worshipper; but by attending to the
   scope of the Psalmist, we may easily discover that he does not propose
   to abrogate them so far as they were helps to piety, but to correct
   that erroneous view of them, which was fraught with the deepest injury
   to religion.

   In the fifteenth verse we have first an injunction to prayer, then a
   promise of its being answered, and afterwards a call to thanksgiving.
   We are enjoined to pray in the day of trouble, but not with the
   understanding that we are to pray only then, for prayer is a duty
   incumbent upon us every day, and every moment of our lives. Be our
   situation ever so comfortable and exempt from disquietude, we must
   never cease to engage in the exercise of supplication, remembering
   that, if God should withdraw his favor for a moment, we would be
   undone. In affliction, however our faith is more severely tried, and
   there is a propriety in specifying it as the season of prayer; the
   prophet pointing us to God as the only resort and means of safety in
   the day of our urgent necessity. A promise is subjoined to animate us
   in the duty, disposed as we are to be overwhelmed by a sense of the
   majesty of God, or of our own unworthiness. Gratitude is next enjoined,
   in consideration of God's answer to our prayers. Invocation of the name
   of God being represented in this passage as constituting a principal
   part of divine worship, all who make pretensions to piety will feel how
   necessary it is to preserve the pure and uncorrupted form of it. We are
   forcibly taught the detestable nature of the error upon this point
   entertained by the Papists, who transfer to angels and to men an honor
   which belongs exclusively to God. They may pretend to view these in no
   other light than as patrons, who pray for them to God. But it is
   evident that these patrons are impiously substituted by them in the
   room of Christ, whose mediation they reject. It is apparent, besides,
   from the form of their prayers, that they recognize no distinction
   between God and the very least of their saints. They ask the same
   things from Saint Claudius which they ask from the Almighty, and offer
   the prayer of our Lord to the image of Catherine. I am aware that the
   Papists justify their invocation of the dead, by denying that their
   prayers to them amount to divine worship. They talk so much about the
   kind of worship which they call latria, that is, the worship which they
   give to God alone, as to make it appear, that in the invocation of
   angels and saints they give none of it to them. [250] But it is
   impossible to read the words of the Psalmist, now under our
   consideration, without perceiving that all true religion is gone unless
   God alone is called upon. Were the Papists asked whether it were lawful
   to offer sacrifices to the dead, they would immediately reply in the
   negative. They grant to this day that sacrifice could not lawfully be
   offered to Peter or to Paul, for the common sense of mankind would
   dictate the profanity of such an act. And when we here see God
   preferring the invocation of his name to all sacrifices, is it not
   plain to demonstration, that those who call upon the dead are
   chargeable with the grossest impiety? From this it follows, that the
   Papists, let them abound as they may in their genuflections before God,
   rob him of the chief part of his glory when they direct their
   supplications to the saints. [251] The express mention which is made in
   these verses of affliction is fitted to comfort the weak and the
   fearful believer. When God has withdrawn the outward marks of his
   favor, a doubt is apt to steal into our minds whether he really cares
   for our salvation. So far is this from being well founded, that
   adversity is sent to us by God, just to stir us up to seek him and to
   call upon his name. Nor should we overlook the fact, that our prayers
   are only acceptable when we offer them in compliance with the
   commandment of God, and are animated to them by a consideration of the
   promise which he has extended. The argument which the Papists have
   drawn from the passage, in support of their multiplied vows, is idle
   and unwarrantable. The Psalmist, as we have already hinted, when he
   enjoins the payment of their vows, refers only to solemn thanksgiving,
   whereas they trust in their vows as meriting salvation. They contract
   vows, beside, which have no divine warrant, but, on the contrary, are
   explicitly condemned by the word of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [248] Dr Adam Clarke reads, "Sacrifice unto God the thank-offering;"
   and observes, that "tvdh, todah, the thank-offering, was the same as
   the sin-offering, viz., a bullock or a ram without blemish;' only there
   was in addition, unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened
   wafers anointed with oil, and cakes of fine flour mingled with oil and
   fried,'" (Leviticus 7:12.)

   [249] The same author translates ndryk, nedareyca, "thy vow-offerings
   The nedar, or vow-offering, was a male without blemish taken from among
   the beeves, the sheep, or the goats. Comp. Leviticus 22:19, with verse
   22."

   [250] The Papists have different words by which they express different
   degrees of worship. The term latreia, or latria, they say, denotes the
   divine worship which exclusively belongs to God, and which they yield
   to him alone; while douleia, or dulia, signifies that inferior sort of
   worship which is due to angels and departed saints, and which alone
   they yield to them. They have also a third degree, which they call
   huperdouleia, or hyperdulia, that superior kind of inferior worship
   which they yield to the Virgin Mary. These distinctions are had
   recourse to, merely to evade the charge of idolatry. But if the Papists
   yield to angels and glorified saints the honor due only to God, it is
   of little consequence by what name it is called. Besides, the words
   latreai and douleai are used indifferently by classic Greek authors, by
   the Greek fathers, by the Septuagint, and in the New Testament, to
   express divine worship. In the New Testament, douleia frequently
   denotes divine worship. Thus we read, in 1 Thessalonians 1:9, "Ye
   turned to God from idols, douleuein to Theo zonti, to serve the living
   God;" and in Galatians 4:8, it is said of the Galatians in their
   heathen state, that "edouleusan, they did service unto them which, by
   nature, are no gods." -- See Calvin's Institutes, Book I. chap.12,
   sections 2 and 3; Turretine's Works, volume 4, De Necessaria Secessione
   Nostra ab Ecclesia Romana, pp. 50-53; and M'Gavin's Protestant,
   volume1, No. 42, p. 334.

   [251] The subject of the invocation of departed saints is discussed at
   length in Calvin's Institutes, Book III. chap. 20, sections 21-27.

   Psalm 50:16-20

   16. But unto the wicked God hath said, What hast thou to do to declare
   my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant into thy lips? 17.
   Also thou hatest correction, and castest my words behind thee. 18. If
   thou seest a thief, thou wilt run with him, and thou hast been partaker
   with adulterers. 19. Thou puttest forth thy mouth to evil, and thy
   tongue frameth deceit. 20. Thou sittest and speakest against thy
   brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's sons.


   16 But unto the wicked, etc. He now proceeds to direct his censures
   more openly against those whose whole religion lies in an observance of
   ceremonies, with which they attempt to blind the eyes of God. An
   exposure is made of the vanity of seeking to shelter impurity of heart
   and life under a veil of outward services, a lesson which ought to have
   been received by all with true consent, but which was peculiarly
   ungrateful to Jewish ears. It has been universally confessed, that the
   worship of God is pure and acceptable only when it proceeds from a
   sincere heart. The acknowledgement has been extorted from the poets of
   the heathen, and it is known that the profligate were wont to be
   excluded from their temples and from participation in their sacrifices.
   And yet such is the influence of hypocrisy in choking and obliterating
   even a sentiment so universally felt as this, that men of the most
   abandoned character will obtrude themselves into the presence of God,
   in the confidence of deceiving him with their vain inventions. This may
   explain the frequency of the warnings which we find in the prophets
   upon this subject, declaring to the ungodly again and again, that they
   only aggravate their guilt by assuming the semblance of piety. Loudly
   as the Spirit of God has asserted, that a form of godliness,
   unaccompanied by the grace of faith and repentance, is but a
   sacrilegious abuse of the name of God; it is yet impossible to drive
   the Papists out of the devilish delusion, that their idlest services
   are sanctified by what they call their final intention. They grant that
   none but such as are in a state of grace can possess the meritum de
   condigno; [252] but they maintain that the mere outward acts of
   devotion, without any accompanying sentiments of the heart, may prepare
   a person at least for the reception of grace. And thus, if a monk rise
   from the bed of his adultery to chant a few psalms without one spark of
   godliness in his breast, or if a whore-monger, a thief, or any
   foresworn villain, seeks to make reparation for his crimes by mass or
   pilgrimage, they would be loath to consider this lost labor. By God, on
   the other hand, such a disjunction of the form from the inward
   sentiment of devotion is branded as sacrilege. In the passage before
   us, the Psalmist sets aside and refutes a very common objection which
   might be urged. Must not, it might be said, those sacrifices be in some
   respect acceptable to God which are offered up in his honor? He shows
   that, on the contrary, they entail guilt upon the parties who present
   them, inasmuch as they lie to God, and profane his holy name. He checks
   their presumption with the words, What hast thou to do to declare my
   statutes? that is, to pretend that you are one of my people, and that
   you have a part in my covenant. Now, if God in this manner rejects the
   whole of that profession of godliness, which is unaccompanied by purity
   of heart, how shall we expect him to treat the observance of mere
   ceremonies, which hold quite an inferior place to the declaration of
   the statutes of God?

   17. Also thou hatest correction Here hypocrites are challenged with
   treacherous duplicity in denying, by their life and their works, that
   godliness which they have professed with the lip. Their contempt of God
   he proves from their want of reverential deference to his Word;
   subjection to the Word of God, and cordial submission to his precepts
   and instructions, being the surest test of religious principle. One way
   in which hypocrisy usually displays itself is, by the ingenious excuses
   it invents for evading the duty of obedience. The Psalmist points to
   this as the mainspring of their ungodliness, that they had cast the
   Word of God behind their back, while he insinuates that the principle
   from which all true worship flows is the obedience of faith. He adverts
   also to the cause of their perversity, which lies in the unwillingness
   of their corrupt heart to suffer the yoke of God. They have no
   hesitation in granting that whatever proceeds from the mouth of God is
   both true and right; this honor they are willing to concede to his
   Word; but in so far as it proposes to regulate their conduct, and
   restrain their sinful affections, they dislike and detest it. Our
   corruption, indisposing us to receive correction, exasperates us
   against the Word of God; nor is it possible that we can ever listen to
   it with true docility and meekness of mind, till we have been brought
   to give ourselves up to be ruled and disciplined by its precepts. The
   Psalmist next proceeds to specify some of those works of ungodliness,
   informing us that hypocrites, who were addicted to theft and adultery,
   mixed up and polluted the holy name of God with their wickedness. By
   adverting only to some species of vices, he would intimate, in general,
   that those who have despised correction, and hardened themselves
   against instruction, are prepared to launch into every excess which
   corrupt desire or evil example may suggests. He makes mention, first,
   of thefts; then of adulteries; and, thirdly, of calumnies or false
   reproaches. Most interpreters render trph, tirets, to run, although
   others derive it from rtsh, ratsah, rendering it to consent. Either
   translation agrees sufficiently with the scope of the Psalmist, and the
   preference may be left to the reader's own choice. The charge here
   brought against hypocrites, that they put forth their mouth to evil,
   may include not merely slander, but all the different kinds of speaking
   which injure their neighbors, for it immediately follows, my tongue
   frameth deceit It is well known in what a variety of ways the lying and
   deceitful tongue may inflict injury and pain. When it is added, Thou
   sittest, etc., the allusion may be to one who sits for the passing of a
   formal judgment; as if it had been said, Thou defamest thy brethren
   under pretext of issuing a just sentence. [253] Or there may be a
   reference to petty calumny; such as men maliciously indulge in, and in
   which they pass their time as they sit at ease in their houses. [254]
   It seems more probable, however, that he refers to the higher crime of
   accusing the innocent and righteous in open court, and bringing false
   charges against them. Brethren, and the children of their mother, [255]
   are mentioned, the more emphatically to express the cruelty of their
   calumnies, when they are represented as violating the ties of nature,
   and not even sparing the nearest relations.

   [252] "The Schoolmen in that Church, the Church of Rome,' spoke of
   meritum de congruo, and meritum de condigno. By meritum de congruo, to
   which Calvin refers in the concluding part of the sentence,' they meant
   the value of good works and good dispositions previous to
   justification, which it was fit or congruous for God to reward by
   infusing his grace. By meritum de condigno they meant the value of good
   works performed after justification, in consequence of the grace then
   infused." -- Dr Hill's Lectures in Divinity, volume 2, p. 348; see also
   Turretine's Theology, volume 2, p. 778.

   [254] When you are sitting still, and have nothing else to do, you are
   ever injuring your neighbor with your slanderous speech. Your
   table-talk is abuse of your nearest friends." -- Horsley. The meaning,
   according to others, is, Thou sittest in the most public places of
   resort, which were usually the gates of the city, and spendest thy time
   in calumniating thy brother. See Psalm 69:12; and 119:23.

   [255] "Thine own mother's son. To understand the force of this

   brethren, but a yet more intimate relationship subsisted between those
   who had the same mother as well as the same father." -- French and
   Skinner. Compare Genesis 20:12. It was a high aggravation of the
   wickedness and malignity of the persons here spoken or; that they
   indulged in abusing with their tongues those to whom they were most
   nearly related, their brother, yea, the son of their mother.

   Psalm 50:21-23

   21. These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest
   that I would be like thyself; [256] I will reprove thee, and set them
   in order before thine eyes. 22. Now consider this, ye that forget God:
   lest I seize upon you, and there be none to deliver. 23. Whoso offereth
   praise will glorify me: and to him that ordereth his way aright will I
   show the salvation of God.


   21 These things hast thou done Hypocrites, until they feel the hand of
   God against them, are ever ready to surrender themselves to a state of
   security, and nothing is more difficult than to awaken their
   apprehensions. By this alarming language the Psalmist aims at
   convincing them of the certainty of destruction should they longer
   presume upon the forbearance of God, and thus provoke his anger the
   more, by imagining that he can favor the practice of sin. The greatest
   dishonor which any can cast upon his name is that of impeaching his
   justice. This hypocrites may not venture to do in an open manner, but
   in their secret and corrupt imagination they figure God to be different
   from what he is, that they may take occasion from his conceived
   forbearance to indulge a false peace of mind, and escape the
   disquietude which they could not fail to feel were they seriously
   persuaded that God was the avenger of sin. We have a sufficient proof
   in the supine security which hypocrites display, that they must have
   formed such false conceptions of God. They not only exclude from their
   thoughts his judicial character, but think of him as the patron and
   approver of their sins. The Psalmist reprehends them for abusing the
   goodness and clemency of God, in the way of cherishing a vain hope that
   they may transgress with impunity. He warns them, that ere long they
   will be dragged into the light, and that those sins which they would
   have hidden from the eyes of God would be set in all their enormity
   before their view. He will set the whole list of their sins in distinct
   order, for so I understand the expression, to set in order, before
   their view, and force them upon their observation.

   22 Now consider this, ye that forget God Here we have more of that
   severe expostulation which is absolutely necessary in dealing with
   hardened hypocrites, who otherwise will only deride all instruction.
   While, however, the Psalmist threatens and intends to alarm them, he
   would, at the same time, hold out to them the hope of pardon, upon
   their hastening to avail themselves of it. But to prevent them from
   giving way to delay, he warns them of the severity, as well as the
   suddenness, of the divine judgments. He also charges them with base
   ingratitude, in having forgotten God. And here what a remarkable proof
   have we of the grace of God in extending the hope of mercy to those
   corrupt men, who had so impiously profaned his worship, who had so
   audaciously and sacrilegiously mocked at his forbearance, and who had
   abandoned themselves to such scandalous crimes! In calling them to
   repentance, without all doubt he extends to them the hope of God being
   reconciled to them, that they may venture to appear in the presence of
   his majesty. And can we conceive of greater clemency than this, thus to
   invite to himself, and into the bosom of the Church, such perfidious
   apostates and violators of his covenant, who had departed from the
   doctrine of godliness in which they had been brought up? Great as it
   is, we would do well to reflect that it is no greater than what we have
   ourselves experienced. We, too, had apostatized from the Lord, and in
   his singular mercy has he brought us again into his fold. It should not
   escape our notice, that the Psalmist urges them to hasten their return,
   as the door of mercy will not always stand open for their admission --
   a needful lesson to us all! lest we allow the day of our merciful
   visitation to pass by, and be left, like Esau, to indulge in unavailing
   lamentations, (Genesis 27:34.) So much is implied when it is said, God
   shall seize upon you, and there shall be none to deliver [257]

   23 Whoso offereth praise will glorify me This is the third time that
   the Psalmist has inculcated the truth, that the most acceptable
   sacrifice in God's sight is praise, by which we express to him the
   gratitude of our hearts for his blessings. The repetition is not a
   needless one, and that on two accounts. In the first place, there is
   nothing with which we are more frequently chargeable than forgetfulness
   of the benefits of the Lord. Scarcely one out of a thousand attracts
   our notice; and if it does, it is only slightly, and, as it were, in
   passing. And, secondly, we do not assign that importance to the duty of
   praise which it deserves. We are apt to neglect it as something
   trivial, and altogether commonplace; whereas it constitutes the chief
   exercise of godliness, in which God would have us to be engaged during
   the whole of our life. In the words before us, the sacrifice of praise
   is asserted to form the true and proper worship of God. The words, will
   glorify me, imply that God is then truly and properly worshipped, and
   the glory which he requires yielded to him, when his goodness is
   celebrated with a sincere and grateful heart; but that all the other
   sacrifices to which hypocrites attach such importance are worthless in
   his estimation, and no part whatsoever of his worship. Under the word
   praise, however, is comprehended, as I have already noticed, both faith
   and prayer. There must be an experience of the goodness of the Lord
   before our mouths can be opened to praise him for it, and this goodness
   can only be experienced by faith. Hence it follows, that the whole of
   spiritual worship is comprehended under what is either presupposed in
   the exercise of praise, or flows from it. Accordingly, in the words
   which immediately follow, the Psalmist calls upon those who desired
   that their services should be approved of God, to order their way
   aright By the expression here used of ordering one's way, some
   understand repentance or confession of sin to be meant; others, the
   taking out of the way such things as may prove grounds of offense, or
   obstacles in the way of others. It seems more probable that the
   Psalmist enjoins them to walk in the right way as opposed to that in
   which hypocrites are found, and intimates that God is only to be
   approached by those who seek him with a sincere heart and in an upright
   manner. By the salvation of God, I do not, with some, understand a
   great or signal salvation. God speaks of himself in the third person,
   the more clearly to satisfy them of the fact, that he would eventually
   prove to all his genuine worshippers how truly he sustained the
   character of their Savior.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [256] Horsley translates these two clauses as follows: -- "These things
   thou hast done, and I was still;
   Thou hast thought that I AM is such an one as thyself. He thinks that
   the words chyvt 'hyh, heyoth ehyeh, which Calvin renders, "I would be,"
   have been misunderstood by all interpreters, and maintains that they
   should be rendered, "I AM is." "All interpreters," says he, "seem to
   have forgotten that 'hyh, ehyeh, is the name which God takes to himself
   in the third chapter of Exodus; and he observes, that it is with
   particular propriety, that God, in expostulating with his people for
   their breach of covenant, calls himself by the name by which he was
   pleased to describe himself to that same people, when he first called
   them by his servant Moses." The LXX. render hyvt, heyoth, as a noun
   substantive, and 'hyh, ehyeh, as the first person future of the
   substantive verb. "Pspelathes anomian, hoti esomai soi homoios:" "Thou
   thoughtest wickedly that I should be like thee."

   [257] The language here is metaphorical. The Almighty, provoked by the
   wickedness of these hypocrites, compares himself to a lion, who, with
   irresistible fury, seizes on his prey, and tears it in pieces, none
   being able to rescue it from his jaws. We meet with a similar form of
   expression in Hosea 5:14: "For I will be as a lion unto Ephraim, and as
   a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I
   will take away, and none shall rescue him." We must not, however,
   suppose that the rage and fury of this relentless destroyer can have
   place in the bosom of the Deity. Such phraseology is adopted in
   accommodation to the feebleness of our conceptions, and our contracted
   modes of thinking, to impress the hearts and consciences of sinners
   with a conviction of the tremendous character of the judgments of God,
   and the fearful condition of those who fall under his penal wrath.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [238] The preposition l, lamed, prefixed to the name of Asaph, which
   Calvin renders of, may also be rendered for, as we have before
   observed, and it is, therefore, somewhat doubtful whether he was the
   author of the psalms in whose inscriptions his name appears, or whether
   they were merely delivered to him by David to be sung m the temple
   worship. We, however, know from 2 Chronicles 29:30, that a seer of the
   name of Asaph, the son of Berechia, and who, along with his sons, were
   appointed singers in the sacred services of the temple, (1 Chronicles
   6:31, 39; 15:19; 25:1, 2; Nehemiah 12:46,) was the inspired writer of
   several psalms. It is therefore probable that he was the author of the
   psalms which bear his name. These are twelve, the 50th, and from the
   73d to the 83d, both inclusive. It has been thought by some that these
   psalms differ very remarkably, both in style and subject, from those of
   David, the composition being more stiff and obscure than the polished,
   flowing, and graceful odes of the sweet singer of Israel, and the
   subject-matter being of a melancholy character, and full of
   reprehension.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PSALM 51

   We learn the cause which led to the composition of this psalm from the
   title appended to it, and which will immediately come under our
   consideration. For a long period after his melancholy fall, David would
   seem to have sunk into a spiritual lethargy; but when roused from it by
   the expostulation of Nathan, he was filled with self-loathing and
   humiliation in the sight of God, and was anxious both to testify his
   repentance to all around him, and leave some lasting proof of it to
   posterity. In the commencement of the psalm, having his eyes directed
   to the heinousness of his guilt, he encourages himself to hope for
   pardon by considering the infinite mercy of God. This he extols in high
   terms, and with a variety of expressions, as one who felt that he
   deserved multiplied condemnation. In the after part of the psalm, he
   prays for restoration to the favor of God, being conscious that he
   deserved to have been cast off for ever, and deprived of all the gifts
   of the Holy Spirit. He promises, should forgiveness be bestowed upon
   him, to retain a deep and grateful sense of it. Towards the conclusion,
   he declares it to be for the good of the Church that God should grant
   his request; and, indeed, when the peculiar manner in which God had
   deposited his covenant of grace with David is considered, it could not
   but be felt that the common hope of the salvation of all must have been
   shaken on the supposition of his final rejection.

   To the chief musician. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came
   to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.

   When Nathan the prophet came to him Express mention is made of the
   prophet having come before the psalm was written, proving, as it does,
   the deep lethargy into which David must have fallen. It was a wonderful
   circumstance that so great a man, and one so eminently gifted with the
   Spirit, should have continued in this dangerous state for upwards of a
   year. Nothing but satanic influence can account for that stupor of
   conscience which could lead him to despise or slight the divine
   judgment, which he had incurred. It serves additionally to mark the
   supineness into which he had fallen, that he seems to have had no
   compunction for his sin till the prophet came to him. We have here a
   striking illustration, at the same time, of the mercy of God in sending
   the prophet to reclaim him when he had wandered. In this view, there is
   an antithesis in the repetition of the word came. It was when David
   came in to Bathsheba that Nathan came to him. By that sinful step he
   had placed himself at a distance from God; and the Divine goodness was
   signally displayed in contemplating his restoration. We do not imagine
   that David, during this interval, was so wholly deprived of the sense
   of religion as no longer to acknowledge the supremacy of the Divine
   Being. In all probability he continued to pray daily, engaged in the
   acts of Divine worship, and aimed at conforming his life to the law of
   God. There is no reason to think that grace was wholly extinct in his
   heart; but only that he was possessed by a spirit of infatuation upon
   one particular point, and labored under a fatal insensibility as to his
   present exposure to Divine wrath. Grace, whatever sparks it might emit
   in other directions, was smothered, so to speak, in this. Well may we
   tremble to contemplate the fact, that so holy a prophet, and so
   excellent a king, should have sunk into such a condition! That the
   sense of religion was not altogether extinguished in his mind, is
   proved by the manner in which he was affected immediately upon
   receiving the prophet's reproof. Had such been the case, he could not
   have cried out as he did, "I have sinned against the Lord," (2 Samuel
   12:13;) nor would he have so readily submitted himself, in the spirit
   of meekness, to admonition and correction. In this respect, he has set
   an example to all such as may have sinned against God, teaching them
   the duty of humbly complying with the calls to repentance, which may be
   addressed to them by his servants, instead of remaining under sin till
   they be surprised by the final vengeance of Heaven.

   Psalm 51:1-2

   1. Have mercy upon me, O God: according to thy lovingkindness;
   according to the multitude of thy compassions, blot out my
   transgressions. 2. Multiply to wash me from mine iniquity, and cleanse
   me from my sin.


   1. Have mercy upon me. David begins, as I have already remarked, by
   praying for pardon; and his sin having been of an aggravated
   description, he prays with unwonted earnestness. He does not satisfy
   himself with one petition. Having mentioned the loving-kindness of the
   Lord, he adds the multitude of his compassions, to intimate that mercy
   of an ordinary kind would not suffice for so great a sinner. Had he
   prayed God to be favorable, simply according to his clemency or
   goodness, even that would have amounted to a confession that his case
   was a bad one; but when he speaks of his sin as remissible, only
   through the countless multitude of the compassions of God, he
   represents it as peculiarly atrocious. There is an implied antithesis
   between the greatness of the mercies sought for, and the greatness of
   the transgression which required them. Still more emphatical is the
   expression which follows, multiply to wash me Some take hrvh, [258]
   herebeh, for a noun, but this is too great a departure from the idiom
   of the language. The sense, on that supposition, would indeed remain
   the same, That God would wash him abundantly, and with multiplied
   washing; but I prefer that form of expression which agrees best with
   the Hebrew idiom. This, at least, is certain from the expression which
   he employs, that he felt the stain of his sin to be deep, and to
   require multiplied washings. Not as if God could experience any
   difficulty in cleansing the worst sinner, but the more aggravated a
   man's sin is, the more earnest naturally are his desires to be
   delivered from the terrors of conscience.

   The figure itself, as all are aware, is one of frequent occurrence in
   Scripture. Sin resembles filth or uncleanness, as it pollutes us, and
   makes us loathsome in the sight of God, and the remission of it is
   therefore aptly compared to washing This is a truth which should both
   commend the grace of God to us, and fill us with detestation of sin.
   Insensible, indeed, must that heart be which is not affected by it!
     __________________________________________________________________

   [258] There are here two verbs, hrvh, herebeh, and kvsny, kabbeseni,
   the first signifying to multiply, and the second to wash Many
   expositors think that the verb hrvh, herebeh, is used in the sense of
   an adverb, and they read, Multum lava me "When two verbs of the same
   tense are joined together, whether a copula goes between them or not,
   the first is often expressed in Latin by an adverb." -- Glass. Lib. 1,
   Tract. 3, De Verbo Can. 29, tom. 1, p. 272. See Genesis 25:1; Psalm
   6:10; 45:5; 78:41; and 102:3
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 51:3-6

   3. For I know my transgressions, and my sin is continually before me.
   4. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done evil in thy sight;
   that thou mayest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when
   thou judgest. 5. Behold, I was born in iniquity, and in sin did my
   mother conceive me. 6. Behold, thou hast desired truth in the inward
   parts, and hast shown me wisdom in secret.


   3. For I know my sins [259] He now discovers his reason for imploring
   pardon with so much vehemency, and this was the painful disquietude
   which his sins caused him, and which could only be relieved by his
   obtaining reconciliation with God. This proves that his prayer did not
   proceed from dissimulation, as many will be found commending the grace
   of God in high terms, although, in reality, they care little about it,
   having never felt the bitterness of being exposed to his displeasure.
   David, on the contrary, declares that he is subjected by his sin to
   constant anguish of mind, and that it is this which imparts such an
   earnestness to his supplications. From his example we may learn who
   they are that can alone be said to seek reconciliation with God in a
   proper manner. They are such as have had their consciences wounded with
   a sense of sin, and who can find no rest until they have obtained
   assurance of his mercy. We will never seriously apply to God for
   pardon, until we have obtained such a view of our sins as inspires us
   with fear. The more easily satisfied we are under our sins, the more do
   we provoke God to punish them with severity, and if we really desire
   absolution from his hand, we must do more than confess our guilt in
   words; we must institute a rigid and formidable scrutiny into the
   character of our transgressions. David does not simply say that he will
   confess his sins to man, but declares that he has a deep inward feeling
   of them, such a feeling of them as filled him with the keenest anguish.
   His was a very different spirit from that of the hypocrite, who
   displays a complete indifference upon this subject, or when it intrudes
   upon him, endeavors to bury the recollection of it. He speaks of his
   sins in the plural number. His transgression, although it sprung from
   one root, was complicated, including, besides adultery, treachery and
   cruelty; nor was it one man only whom he had betrayed, but the whole
   army which had been summoned to the field in defense of the Church of
   God. He accordingly recognises many particular sins as wrapt up in it.

   4. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned [260] It is the opinion of
   some that he here adverts to the circumstance of his sin, although it
   was committed against man, being concealed from every eye but that of
   God. None was aware of the double wrong which he had inflicted upon
   Uriah, nor of the wanton manner in which he had exposed his army to
   danger; and his crime being thus unknown to men, might be said to have
   been committed exclusively against God. According to others, David here
   intimates, that however deeply he was conscious of having injured men,
   he was chiefly distressed for having violated the law of God. But I
   conceive his meaning to be, that though all the world should pardon
   him, he felt that God was the Judge with whom he had to do, that
   conscience hailed him to his bar, and that the voice of man could
   administer no relief to him, however much he might be disposed to
   forgive, or to excuse, or to flatter. His eyes and his whole soul were
   directed to God, regardless of what man might think or say concerning
   him. To one who is thus overwhelmed with a sense of the dreadfulness of
   being obnoxious to the sentence of God, there needs no other accuser.
   God is to him instead of a thousand. There is every reason to believe
   that David, in order to prevent his mind from being soothed into a
   false peace by the flatteries of his court, realised the judgment of
   God upon his offense, and felt that this was in itself an intolerable
   burden, even supposing that he should escape all trouble from the hands
   of his fellow-creatures. This will be the exercise of every true
   penitent. It matters little to obtain our acquittal at the bar of human
   judgment, or to escape punishment through the connivance of others,
   provided we suffer from an accusing conscience and an offended God. And
   there is, perhaps, no better remedy against deception in the matter of
   our sins than to turn our thoughts inward upon ourselves, to
   concentrate them upon God, and lose every self-complacent imagination
   in a sharp sense of his displeasure. By a violent process of
   interpretation, some would have us read the second clause of this
   verse, That thou mayest be justified when thou speakest, in connection
   with the first verse of the psalm, and consider that it cannot be
   referred to the sentence immediately preceding. [261] But not to say
   that this breaks in upon the order of the verses, what sense could any
   attach to the prayer as it would then run, have mercy upon me, that
   thou mayest be clear when thou judgest? etc. Any doubt upon the meaning
   of the words, however, is completely removed by the connection in which
   they are cited in Paul's Epistle to the Romans,

   "For what if some did not believe? Shall God be unjust? God forbid:
   yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou
   mayest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art
   judged." -- Romans 3:3, 4

   Here the words before us are quoted in proof of the doctrine that God's
   righteousness is apparent even in the sins of men, and his truth in
   their falsehood. To have a clear apprehension of their meaning, it is
   necessary that we reflect upon the covenant which God had made with
   David. The salvation of the whole world having been in a certain sense
   deposited with him by this covenant, the enemies of religion might take
   occasion to exclaim upon his fall, "Here is the pillar of the Church
   gone, and what is now to become of the miserable remnant whose hopes
   rested upon his holiness? Once nothing could be more conspicuous than
   the glory by which he was distinguished, but mark the depth of disgrace
   to which he has been reduced! Who, after so gross a fall, would look
   for salvation from his seed?" Aware that such attempts might be made to
   impugn the righteousness of God, David takes this opportunity of
   justifying it, and charging himself with the whole guilt of the
   transaction. He declares that God was justified when he spoke -- not
   when he spoke the promises of the covenant, although some have so
   understood the words, but justified should he have spoken the sentence
   of condemnation against him for his sin, as he might have done but for
   his gratuitous mercy. Two forms of expression are here employed which
   have the same meaning, that thou mayest be justified when thou
   speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. As Paul, in the quotation
   already referred to, has altered the latter clause, and may even seem
   to have given a new turn to the sentiment contained in the verse, I
   shall briefly show how the words were applicable to the purpose for
   which they were cited by him. He adduces them to prove that God's
   faithfulness remained unaffected by the fact that the Jews had broken
   his covenant, and fallen from the grace which he had promised. Now, at
   first sight it may not appear how they contain the proof alleged. But
   their appositeness will at once be seen if we reflect upon the
   circumstance to which I have already adverted. Upon the fall of one who
   was so great a pillar in the Church, so illustrious both as a prophet
   and a king, as David, we cannot but believe that many were shaken and
   staggered in the faith of the promises. Many must have been disposed to
   conclude, considering the close connection into which God had adopted
   David, that he was implicated in some measure in his fall. David,
   however, repels an insinuation so injurious to the divine honor, and
   declares, that although God should cast him headlong into everlasting
   destruction, his mouth would be shut, or opened only to acknowledge his
   unimpeachable justice. The sole departure which the apostle has made
   from the passage in his quotation consists in his using the verb to
   judge in a passive sense, and reading, that thou mightest overcome,
   instead of, that thou mightest be clear. In this he follows the
   Septuagint, [262] and it is well known that the apostles do not study
   verbal exactness in their quotations from the Old Testament. It is
   enough for us to be satisfied, that the passage answers the purpose for
   which it was adduced by the apostle. The general doctrine which we are
   taught from the passage is, that whatever sins men may commit are
   chargeable entirely upon themselves, and never can implicate the
   righteousness of God. Men are ever ready to arraign his administration,
   when it does not correspond with the judgment of sense and human
   reason. But should God at any time raise persons from the depth of
   obscurity to the highest distinction, or, on the other hand, allow
   persons who occupied a most conspicuous station to be suddenly
   precipitated from it, we should learn from the example which is here
   set before us to judge of the divine procedure with sobriety, modesty,
   and reverence and to rest satisfied that it is holy, and that the works
   of God, as well as his words, are characterised by unerring rectitude.
   The conjunction in the verse, that-that thou mayest be justified,
   denotes not so much cause as consequence. It was not the fall of David,
   properly speaking, which caused the glory of God's righteousness to
   appear. And yet, although men when they sin seem to obscure his
   righteousness, it emerges from the foul attempt only more bright than
   ever, it being the peculiar work of God to bring light out of darkness.

   5 Behold, I was born in iniquity, etc He now proceeds further than the
   mere acknowledgement of one or of many sins, confessing that he brought
   nothing but sin with him into the world, and that his nature was
   entirely depraved. He is thus led by the consideration of one offense
   of peculiar atrocity to the conclusion that he was born in iniquity,
   and was absolutely destitute of all spiritual good. Indeed, every sin
   should convince us of the general truth of the corruption of our
   nature. The Hebrew word ychmtny, yechemathni, signifies literally, hath
   warmed herself of me, from ychm, yacham, or chmm, chamam, to warm; but
   interpreters have very properly rendered it hath conceived me. The
   expression intimates that we are cherished in sin from the first moment
   that we are in the womb. David, then, is here brought, by reflecting on
   one particular transgression, to east a retrospective glance upon his
   whole past life, and to discover nothing but sin in it. And let us not
   imagine that he speaks of the corruption of his nature, merely as
   hypocrites will occasionally do, to excuse their faults, saying, "I
   have sinned it may be, but what could I do? We are men, and prone by
   nature to everything which is evil." David has recourse to no such
   stratagems for evading the sentence of God, and refers to original sin
   with the view of aggravating his guilt, acknowledging that he had not
   contracted this or that sin for the first time lately, but had been
   born into the world with the seed of every iniquity.

   The passage affords a striking testimony in proof of original sin
   entailed by Adam upon the whole human family. It not only teaches the
   doctrine, but may assist us in forming a correct idea of it. The
   Pelagians, to avoid what they considered the absurdity of holding that
   all were ruined through one man's transgression, maintained of old,
   that sin descended from Adam only through force of imitation. But the
   Bible, both in this and other places, clearly asserts that we are born
   in sin, and that it exists within us as a disease fixed in our nature.
   David does not charge it upon his parents, nor trace his crime to them,
   but sists himself before the Divine tribunal, confesses that he was
   formed in sin, and that he was a transgressor ere he saw the light of
   this world. It was therefore a gross error in Pelagius to deny that sin
   was hereditary, descending in the human family by contagion. The
   Papists, in our own day, grant that the nature of man has become
   depraved, but they extenuate original sin as much as possible, and
   represent it as consisting merely in an inclination to that which is
   evil. They restrict its seat besides to the inferior part of the soul
   and the gross appetites; and while nothing is more evident from
   experience than that corruption adheres to men through life, they deny
   that it remains in them subsequently to baptism. We have no adequate
   idea of the dominion of sin, unless we conceive of it as extending to
   every part of the soul, and acknowledge that both the mind and heart of
   man have become utterly corrupt. The language of David sounds very
   differently from that of the Papists, I was formed in iniquity, and in
   sin did my mother conceive me He says nothing of his grosser appetites,
   but asserts that sin cleaved by nature to every part of him without
   exception.

   Here the question has been started, How sin is transmitted from the
   parents to the children? And this question has led to another regarding
   the transmission of the soul, many denying that corruption can be
   derived from the parent to the child, except on the supposition of one
   soul being begotten of the substance of another. Without entering upon
   such mysterious discussions, it is enough that we hold, that Adam, upon
   his fall, was despoiled of his original righteousness, his reason
   darkened, his will perverted, and that, being reduced to this state of
   corruption, he brought children into the world resembling himself in
   character. Should any object that generation is confined to bodies, and
   that souls can never derive anything in common from one another, I
   would reply, that Adam, when he was endued at his creation with the
   gifts of the Spirit, did not sustain a private character, but
   represented all mankind, who may be considered as having been endued
   with these gifts in his person; and from this view it necessarily
   follows that when he fell, we all forfeited along with him our original
   integrity. [263]

   6. Behold, thou hast desired truth, etc. This verse confirms the remark
   which we already made, that David was far from seeking to invent an
   apology for his sin, when he traced it back to the period of his
   conception, and rather intended by this to acknowledge that from his
   very infancy he was an heir of eternal death. He thus represents his
   whole life to have been obnoxious to condemnation. So far is he from
   imitating those who arraign God as the author of sin, and impiously
   suggest that he might have given man a better nature, that in the verse
   now before us he opposes God's judgment to our corruption, insinuating,
   that every time we appear before him, we are certain of being
   condemned, inasmuch as we are born in sin, while he delights in
   holiness and uprightness. He goes further, and asserts, that in order
   to meet the approval of God, it is not enough that our lives be
   conformed to the letter of his law, unless our heart be clean and
   purified from all guile. He tells us that God desires truth in the
   inward parts, [264] intimating to us, that secret as well as outward
   and gross sins excite his displeasure. In the second clause of the
   verse, he aggravates his offense by confessing that he could not plead
   the excuse of ignorance. He had been sufficiently instructed by God in
   his duty. Some interpret vstvm, besathum, as if he here declared that
   God had discovered secret mysteries to him, or things hidden from the
   human understanding. He seems rather to mean that wisdom had been
   discovered to his mind in a secret and intimate manner. [265] The one
   member of the verse responds to the other. He acknowledges that it was
   not a mere superficial acquaintance with divine truth which he had
   enjoyed, but that it had been closely brought home to his heart. This
   rendered his offense the more inexcusable. Though privileged so highly
   with the saving knowledge of the truth, he had plunged into the
   commission of brutish sin, and by various acts of iniquity had almost
   ruined his soul.

   We have thus set before us the exercise of the Psalmist at this time.
   First, we have seen that he is brought to a confession of the greatness
   of his offense: this leads him to a sense of the complete depravity of
   his nature: to deepen his convictions, he then directs his thoughts to
   the strict judgment of God, who looks not to the outward appearance but
   the heart; and, lastly, he adverts to the peculiarity of his case, as
   one who had enjoyed no ordinary measure of the gifts of the Spirit, and
   deserved on that account the severer punishment. The exercise is such
   as we should all strive to imitate. Are we conscious of having
   committed any one sin, let it be the means of recalling others to our
   recollection, until we are brought to prostrate ourselves before God in
   deep self-abasement. And if it has been our privilege to enjoy the
   special teaching of the Spirit of God, we ought to feel that our guilt
   is additionally heavy, having sinned in this case against light, and
   having trampled under foot the precious gifts with which we were
   intrusted.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [259] As if he had said, "I confess and acknowledge that I have sinned,
   nor do I say as Cain did, I know not,' (Genesis 4:9.) What I formerly
   shamefully and foolishly excused and extenuated, I now acknowledge
   before thee and thy prophet, and the whole Church, in this penitential
   psalm." The verb is in the future, I will know or acknowledge, to
   intimate that he would continue to retain an humble sense of his guilt.

   [260] From the confession which David makes in this verse, "Against
   thee, thee only, have I sinned," Horsley is of opinion that the title
   of the psalm is not authentic, and that it could not have been composed
   on the occasion to which the title refers. "It ill suits the case of
   David," says he, "who laid a successful plot against Uriah after he had
   defiled his bed." But there seems to be no force in this objection. The
   prefix l, lamed, translated against, sometimes means before, in the
   presence of, and is so rendered in Genesis 23:11, and 45:1. The Hebrew
   words lk lvrk, lecha, lebaddecha, may, therefore be rendered, "before
   thee, before thee only." If this reading is adopted, then, David
   alludes to the clandestine manner in which he committed the sin,
   intimating that it was a secret sin witnessed by God only, and known in
   the first instance only to him, God says of it, "For thou didst it
   secretly," (2 Samuel 12:12.) There is, however, no need to alter the
   translation to meet the objection of Horsley. By these words, "Against
   thee, thee only," David does not mean to say that he had not wronged
   Uriah, whose wife he had dishonored, whom he had caused to be made
   drunk, and afterwards to be slain; for he acknowledges in the 14th
   verse that "blood-guiltiness" lay heavy upon him, and he prays for
   deliverance from it. They are an emphatic declaration of the
   heinousness of his guilt -- that he had sinned chiefly against God --
   more against him than against man. "My offense," as if he had said,
   "against Uriah, and against society at large, great as it has been, is
   nothing compared to that which I have committed against thee."

   [261] This is the opinion of R. Abraham and other Jewish commentators.
   They say that these words are not to be joined to the immediately
   preceding part of this verse, but either to the prayer in the first
   verse, or to what is stated in the third verse, "I acknowledge my
   transgressions;" and they put the beginning of the fourth verse,
   "Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done evil in thy sight,"
   within a parenthesis. But there is no just ground for such an
   interpretation. Green reads the last clause of the verse, "So that thou
   art just in passing sentence upon me, and clear in condemning me." And
   it is not uncommon for lmn, le-maan, to be used in the sense of so
   that, as in Psalm 30:12; Isaiah 28:13; and Jeremiah 50:34. According to
   this reading, the words are a part of David's confession; -- he not
   only confesses his sin in the first part of the verse, but also here
   acknowledges the divine righteousness should God condemn him. This is
   the sense in which Calvin understands the passage.

   [262] There does not appear to be any substantial difference between
   the reading of the Septuagint, which the apostle follows, and that of
   the Hebrew text. Calvin says that Paul uses the verb to judge in a
   passive sense, whereas it is here used actively. But this is a mistake.
   Street, after giving the words of the Septuagint, which are, Nikeses en
   to krinesthai se, says, "The verb krinesthai is in the middle, not in
   the passive voice, and the phrase en to krinesthai se, signifies cum tu
   judicas," [i e when thou judgest.] "I take notice of this the rather,
   because the passage being cited by Paul, Romans 3:4, (and the
   Septuagint version of it having been inserted instead of the Hebrew,
   which the apostle quoted,) our translators seem to have mistaken the
   sense of it; for they render it, That thou mightest be justified in thy
   sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.' But who shall
   judge the Almighty?" In the other instance which Calvin mentions, the
   difference between the apostle's reading and that of the Hebrew text is
   more in appearance than in reality. "The word zkh," says Hammond, "is
   ordinarily rendered mundus fuit, clean, or clear, or pure But this, as
   the context evinces, must be understood in a forensic sense, as pure is
   all one with free from guilt; and so there is a second notion of the
   word for overcoming, meaning that sort of victory which belongs to him
   that carries the cause in judicature." After stating that this is the
   rendering of the Septuagint, he observes, "That is very reconcilable
   with the notion of mundus fuit; for he that doth overcome in the suit
   is fitly said to be cleared or quitted by the law." Thus Hammond, with
   Chrysostom, supposes the meaning to be, that should God proceed against
   David, should he indite and arraign him at the bar of justice for his
   sins, demanding vengeance to be inflicted upon him, God would be
   justified and cleared, and would overcome in the suit.

   [263] Our Author's views on the doctrine of original sin are more fully
   stated in his Institutes, Book II. chap. 1.

   [264] The word tchvt, tuchoth, which is rendered inward parts, and
   which is derived from the verb tvch, tuach, to spread over, means the
   reins, which are so called, because they are overspread with fat. "Once
   more it is used in Scripture, Job 38:36, where, as here, our English
   Bible renders it inward parts, somewhat too generally. The Chaldee
   expresses it more particularly by reins, and these, in the Scripture
   style, are frequently taken for the seat of the affections, the purity
   whereof is most contrary to the natural corruption or inbred pollution
   spoken of in the preceding verse. The word 'mt, emeth, truth,
   ordinarily signifies sincerity, uprightness, and integrity; and so
   truth in the reins is equivalent to a hearty sincere obedience, not
   only of the actions, but of the very thoughts and affections to God;
   and so, in things of this nature, wherein this psalm is principally
   concerned, denotes the purity of the heart, the not admitting any
   unclean desire or thought, the very first degree of indulgence to any
   lust. And this God is said to will, or desire, or delight in, and so to
   command and require of us." -- Hammond

   [265] The word is explained in the first of these senses in the
   Septuagint: "Ta adela kai ta kruphia tos sophias edelosis moi;" --
   "Thou hast manifested to me the secret and hidden things of thy
   wisdom." Viewed in this light as well as in the other, the language
   expresses the aggravated nature of David's sin. He had sinned, although
   God had revealed to him high and secret mysteries.

   Psalm 51:7-9

   7. Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; thou shalt
   wash me, and I shall be whiter than the snow. 8. Make me to hear joy
   and gladness; and the bones which thou hast broken shall rejoice. 9.
   Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.


   7. Thou shalt purge me with hyssop He still follows out the same strain
   of supplication; and the repetition of his requests for pardon proves
   how earnestly he desired it. He speaks of hyssop [266] , in allusion to
   the ceremonies of the law; and though he was far from putting his trust
   in the mere outward symbol of purification, he knew that, like every
   other legal rite, it was instituted for an important end. The
   sacrifices were seals of the grace of God. In them, therefore, he was
   anxious to find assurance of his reconciliation; and it is highly
   proper that, when our faith is disposed at any time to waver, we should
   confirm it by improving such means of divine support. All which David
   here prays for is, that God would effectually accomplish, in his
   experience, what he had signified to his Church and people by these
   outward rites; and in this he has set us a good example for our
   imitation. It is no doubt to the blood of Christ alone that we must
   look for the atonement of our sins; but we are creatures of sense, who
   must see with our eyes, and handle with our hands; and it is only by
   improving the outward symbols of propitiation that we can arrive at a
   full and assured persuasion of it. What we have said of the hyssop
   applies also to the washings [267] referred to in this verse, and which
   were commonly practiced under the Law. They figuratively represented
   our being purged from all iniquity, in order to our reception into the
   divine favor. I need not say that it is the peculiar work of the Holy
   Spirit to sprinkle our consciences inwardly with the blood of Christ,
   and, by removing the sense of guilt, to secure our access into the
   presence of God.

   In the two verses which follow, the Psalmist prays that God would be
   pacified towards him. Those put too confined a meaning upon the words
   who have suggested that, in praying to hear the voice of joy and
   gladness, he requests some prophet to be sent, who might assure him of
   pardon. He prays, in general, for testimonies of the divine favor. When
   he speaks of his bones as having been broken, he alludes to the extreme
   grief and overwhelming distress to which he had been reduced. The joy
   of the Lord would reanimate his soul; and this joy he describes as to
   be obtained by hearing; for it is the word of God alone which can first
   and effectually cheer the heart of any sinner. There is no true or
   solid peace to be enjoyed in the world except in the way of reposing
   upon the promises of God. Those who do not resort to them may succeed
   for a time in hushing or evading the terrors of conscience, but they
   must ever be strangers to true inward comfort. And, granting that they
   may attain to the peace of insensibility, this is not a state which
   could satisfy any man who has seriously felt the fear of the Lord. The
   joy which he desires is that which flows from hearing the word of God,
   in which he promises to pardon our guilt, and readmit us into his
   favor. It is this alone which supports the believer amidst all the
   fears, dangers, and distresses of his earthly pilgrimage; for the joy
   of the Spirit is inseparable from faith. When God is said, in the 9th
   verse, to hide his face from our sins, this signifies his pardoning
   them, as is explained in the clause immediately annexed -- Blot out all
   my sins. This represents our justification as consisting in a voluntary
   act of God, by which he condescends to forget all our iniquities; and
   it represents our cleansing to consist in the reception of a gratuitous
   pardon. We repeat the remark which has been already made, that David,
   in thus reiterating his one request for the mercy of God, evinces the
   depth of that anxiety which he felt for a favor which his conduct had
   rendered difficult of attainment. The man who prays for pardon in a
   mere formal manner, is proved to be a stranger to the dreadful desert
   of sin. "Happy is the man," said Solomon, "that feareth alway,"
   (Proverbs 28:14.)

   But here it may be asked why David needed to pray so earnestly for the
   joy of remission, when he had already received assurance from the lips
   of Nathan that his sin was pardoned? (2 Samuel 12:13.) Why did he not
   embrace this absolution? and was he not chargeable with dishonoring God
   by disbelieving the word of his prophet? We cannot expect that God will
   send us angels in order to announce the pardon which we require. Was it
   not said by Christ, that whatever his disciples remitted on earth would
   be remitted in heaven? (John 20:23.) And does not the apostle declare
   that ministers of the gospel are ambassadors to reconcile men to God?
   (2 Corinthians 5:20.) From this it might appear to have argued unbelief
   in David, that, notwithstanding the announcement of Nathan, he should
   evince a remaining perplexity or uncertainty regarding his forgiveness.
   There is a twofold explanation which may be given of the difficulty. We
   may hold that Nathan did not immediately make him aware of the fact
   that God was willing to be reconciled to him. In Scripture, it is well
   known, things are not always stated according to the strict order of
   time in which they occurred. It is quite conceivable that, having
   thrown him into this situation of distress, God might keep him in it
   for a considerable interval, for his deeper humiliation; and that David
   expresses in these verses the dreadful anguish which he endured when
   challenged with his crime, and not yet informed of the divine
   determination to pardon it. Let us take the other supposition, however,
   and it by no means follows that a person may not be assured of the
   favor of God, and yet show great earnestness and importunity in praying
   for pardon. David might be much relieved by the announcement of the
   prophet, and yet be visited occasionally with fresh convictions,
   influencing him to have recourse to the throne of grace. However rich
   and liberal the offers of mercy may be which God extends to us, it is
   highly proper on our part that we should reflect upon the grievous
   dishonor which we have done to his name, and be filled with due sorrow
   on account of it. Then our faith is weak, and we cannot at once
   apprehend the full extent of the divine mercy; so that there is no
   reason to be surprised that David should have once and again renewed
   his prayers for pardon, the more to confirm his belief in it. The truth
   is, that we cannot properly pray for the pardon of sin until we have
   come to a persuasion that God will be reconciled to us. Who can venture
   to open his mouth in God's presence unless he be assured of his
   fatherly favor? And pardon being the first thing we should pray for, it
   is plain that there is no inconsistency in having a persuasion of the
   grace of God, and yet proceeding to supplicate his forgiveness. In
   proof of this, I might refer to the Lord's Prayer, in which we are
   taught to begin by addressing God as our Father, and yet afterwards to
   pray for the remission of our sins. God's pardon is full and complete;
   but our faith cannot take in his overflowing goodness, and it is
   necessary that it should distil to us drop by drop. It is owing to this
   infirmity of our faith, that we are often found repeating and repeating
   again the same petition, not with the view surely of gradually
   softening the heart of God to compassion, but because we advance by
   slow and difficult steps to the requisite fullness of assurance. The
   mention which is here made of purging with hyssop, and of washing or
   sprinkling, teaches us, in all our prayers for the pardon of sin, to
   have our thoughts directed to the great sacrifice by which Christ has
   reconciled us to God. "Without shedding of blood," says Paul, "is no
   remissions" (Hebrews 9:22;) and this, which was intimated by God to the
   ancient Church under figures, has been fully made known by the coming
   of Christ. The sinner, if he would find mercy, must look to the
   sacrifice of Christ, which expiated the sins of the world, glancing, at
   the same time, for the confirmation of his faith, to Baptism and the
   Lord's Supper; for it were vain to imagine that God, the Judge of the
   world, would receive us again into his favor in any other way than
   through a satisfaction made to his justice.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [266] Hyssop was much used by the Hebrews in their sacred purifications
   and sprinklings. The allusion here probably is to the ceremony of
   sprinkling such as had been infected with leprosy. Two birds were to be
   taken, cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop; one of the birds was to be
   killed, and the priest having dipped the living bird, the cedar wood,
   scarlet, and hyssop, in the blood of the bird that was killed,
   sprinkled the leper, (Leviticus 14.) This ceremony, it is to be
   observed, was not to be performed until the person was cured; and it
   was intended as a declaration to the people, that, God having healed
   him of a disease which no human means could remove, he might with
   safety be restored to society, and to the privileges of which he had
   been deprived. David, polluted with the crimes of adultery and murder,
   regarded himself as a man affected with the dreadful disease of
   leprosy, and he prays that God would sprinkle him with hyssop, as the
   leper was sprinkled, using this figurative language to express his
   ardent desires to obtain forgiveness and cleansing by the application
   of the blood of Christ, and that God would show to the people that he
   had pardoned his sin, restored him to favor, and purified his soul.

   [267] David felt that he was stained, as it were, by the blood of
   Uriah, and therefore he prays, "Wash me." The word kvsn, cabbeseni,
   wash me, is from kvs, cabas, to tread, to trample with the feet; and
   hence it signifies to wash, to cleanse, for example, garments, by
   treading them in a trough, etc. It differs from rchph, rachats, to lave
   or wash the body, as the Greek word plunein, to cleanse soiled
   garments, differs from louein, to wash the body See Gesenius Lexicon.
   These two words, kvs, cabas, and rchph, rachats, which thus express
   different kinds of washing, observes Bishop Mant, "are always used in
   the Hebrew language with the strictest propriety: the one to signify
   that kind of washing which pervades the substance of the thing washed,
   and cleanses it thoroughly; and the other to express that kind of
   washing which only cleanses the surface of a substance, which the water
   cannot penetrate. The former is applied to the washing of clothes; the
   latter is used for washing some part of the body. By a beautiful and
   strong metaphor, David uses the former word in this and the second
   verse: Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my
   sin.' Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.' So in Jeremiah 4:14,
   the same word is applied to the heart. There is a similar distinction
   in the Greek language, which the LXX. constantly observe in their
   rendering of the Hebrew words above alluded to."

   Psalm 51:10-12

   10. Create in me a clean heart, O God! and renew a right spirit [268]
   in my inward parts. 11. Cast me not away from thy presence, and take
   not the Spirit of thy holiness from me. 12. Restore unto me the joy of
   thy salvation, and uphold me with a free spirit.


   10 Create in me a clean heart, O God! In the previous part of the psalm
   David has been praying for pardon. He now requests that the grace of
   the Spirit, which he had forfeited, or deserved to have forfeited,
   might be restored to him. The two requests are quite distinct, though
   sometimes confounded together, even by men of learning. He passes from
   the subject of the gratuitous remission of sin to that of
   sanctification. And to this he was naturally led with earnest anxiety,
   by the consciousness of his having merited the loss of all the gifts of
   the Spirit, and of his having actually, in a great measure, lost them.
   By employing the term create, he expresses his persuasion that nothing
   less than a miracle could effect his reformation, and emphatically
   declares that repentance is the gift of God. The Sophists grant the
   necessity of the aids of the Spirit, and allow that assisting grace
   must both go before and come after; but by assigning a middle place to
   the free will of man, they rob God of a great part of his glory. David,
   by the word which he here uses, describes the work of God in renewing
   the heart in a manner suitable to its extraordinary nature,
   representing it as the formation of a new creature.

   As he had already been endued with the Spirit, he prays in the latter
   part of the verse that God would renew a right spirit within him But by
   the term create, which he had previously employed, he acknowledges that
   we are indebted entirely to the grace of God, both for our first
   regeneration, and, in the event of our falling, for subsequent
   restoration. He does not merely assert that his heart and spirit were
   weak, requiring divine assistance, but that they must remain destitute
   of all purity and rectitude till these be communicated from above. By
   this it appears that our nature is entirely corrupt: for were it
   possessed of any rectitude or purity, David would not, as in this
   verse, have called the one a gift of the Spirit, and the other a
   creation.

   In the verse which follows, he presents the same petition, in language
   which implies the connection of pardon with the enjoyment of the
   leading of the Holy Spirit. If God reconcile us gratuitously to
   himself, it follows that he will guide us by the Spirit of adoption. It
   is only such as he loves, and has numbered among his own children, that
   he blesses with a share of his Spirit; and David shows that he was
   sensible of this when he prays for the continuance of the grace of
   adoption as indispensable to the continued possession of the Spirit.
   The words of this verse imply that the Spirit had not altogether been
   taken away from him, however much his gifts had been temporarily
   obscured. Indeed, it is evident that he could not be altogether
   divested of his former excellencies, for he seems to have discharged
   his duties as a king with credit, to have conscientiously observed the
   ordinances of religion, and to have regulated his conduct by the divine
   law. Upon one point he had fallen into a deadly lethargy, but he was
   not given over to a reprobate mind;" and it is scarcely conceivable
   that the rebuke of Nathan the prophet should have operated so easily
   and so suddenly in arousing him, had there been no latent spark of
   godliness still remaining in his soul. He prays, it is true, that his
   spirit may be renewed, but this must be understood with a limitation.
   The truth on which we are now insisting is an important one, as many
   learned men have been inconsiderately drawn into the opinion that the
   elect, by falling into mortal sin, may lose the Spirit altogether, and
   be alienated from God. The contrary is clearly declared by Peter, who
   tells us that the word by which we are born again is an incorruptible
   seed, (1 Peter 1:23;) and John is equally explicit in informing us that
   the elect are preserved from falling away altogether, (1 John 3:9.)
   However much they may appear for a time to have been cast off by God,
   it is afterwards seen that grace must have been alive in their breast,
   even during that interval when it seemed to be extinct. Nor is there
   any force in the objection that David speaks as if he feared that he
   might be deprived of the Spirit. It is natural that the saints, when
   they have fallen into sin, and have thus done what they could to expel
   the grace of God, should feel an anxiety upon this point; but it is
   their duty to hold fast the truth that grace is the incorruptible seed
   of God, which never can perish in any heart where it has been
   deposited. This is the spirit displayed by David. Reflecting upon his
   offense, he is agitated with fears, and yet rests in the persuasion
   that, being a child of God, he would not be deprived of what indeed he
   had justly forfeited.

   12 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation He cannot dismiss his grief
   of mind until he have obtained peace with God. This he declares once
   and again, for David had no sympathy with those who can indulge
   themselves in ease when they are lying under the divine displeasure. In
   the latter clause of the verse, he prays as in the verses preceding,
   that the Holy Spirit might not be taken away from him. There is a
   slight ambiguity in the words. Some take tsmkny, thismecheni, to be the
   third person of the verb, because rvch, ruach, is feminine, and
   translate, let the Spirit uphold me. The difference is immaterial, and
   does not affect the meaning of the passage. There is more difficulty in
   fixing the sense of the epithet ndyvh, nedibah, which I have translated
   free As the verb ndv, nadab, signifies to deal liberally, princes are
   in the Hebrew called, by way of eminence, ndyvym, nedibim, which has
   led several learned men to think that David speaks here of a princely
   or royal spirit; and the translators of the Septuagint rendered it
   accordingly hegemonikon. The prayer, in this sense, would no doubt be a
   suitable one for David, who was a king, and required a heroical courage
   for the execution of his office. But it seems better to adopt the more
   extensive meaning, and to suppose that David, under a painful
   consciousness of the bondage to which he had been reduced by a sense of
   guilt, prays for a free and cheerful spirit. [269] This invaluable
   attainment, he was sensible, could only be recovered through divine
   grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [268] French and Skinner read, "a steadfast spirit; i.e., a mind steady
   in following the path of duty."

   [269] Some commentators refer the clause, upon which Calvin is here
   commenting, to the Holy Spirit, and others to the qualities of mind
   with which David desired to be endued. The translators of our English
   Bible understand the expression in the first sense, reading, "thy free
   Spirit." The word thy is a supplement, but it does not appear to be
   liable to any material objection. Fry, who adopts the same view, reads,
   "bountiful or spontaneously flowing Spirit;" and observes, that the
   word ndyvh, nedibah, "is more still than spontaneously flowing: it
   signifies to flow both spontaneously and plentifully: prae uberitate
   succi sponte fluens.' This epithet of the indwelling Spirit will be
   best explained from our Lord's own words, John 4:14, and 7:38." Others
   refer the expression to the mind of the Psalmist. Mudge reads, "And let
   a plentiful effusion of spirit support me." Dimock, "Let a free spirit
   sustain me;" "that is," says he, "let me not be enslaved, as I have
   been, by my sinful passions." Green, "And support with a cheerful
   spirit." French and Skinner, "And may a willing spirit uphold me;" by
   which they understand, "a spirit devoted to the service of God."
   Walford, following the Septuagint, reads, "And with a princely spirit
   sustain me." "David," says this critic, "was so overwhelmed by the
   consciousness of his extreme iniquity, so broken in spirit, courage,
   and fortitude, as to feel altogether incompetent to the discharge of
   his office, as the King of Israel. He therefore addresses this petition
   to God, in the hope that he would grant to him a renewal of that
   powerful energy by which he had at first been fitted for an employment
   so every way unsuitable to his lowly descent, and his employment as a
   shepherd."

   Psalm 51:13-15

   13. I will teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall be converted
   unto thee. 14. Deliver me from bloods, O God! thou God of my salvation,
   and my tongue shall sing aloud with joy of thy righteousness. 15. O
   Lord! open thou my lips, and my mouth shall show forth thy praise.


   13 I will teach transgressors thy ways Here he speaks of the gratitude
   which he would feel should God answer his prayer, and engages to show
   it by exerting himself in effecting the conversion of others by his
   example. Those who have been mercifully recovered from their falls will
   feel inflamed by the common law of charity to extend a helping hand to
   their brethren; and in general, such as are partakers of the grace of
   God are constrained by religious principle, and regard for the divine
   glory, to desire that others should be brought into the participation
   of it. The sanguine manner in which he expresses his expectation of
   converting others is not unworthy of our notice. We are too apt to
   conclude that our attempts at reclaiming the ungodly are vain and
   ineffectual, and forget that God is able to crown them with success.

   14 Deliver me from bloods His recurring so often to petitions for
   pardon, proves how far David was from flattering himself with unfounded
   hopes, and what a severe struggle he sustained with inward terrors.
   According to some, he prays in this verse to be delivered from the
   guilt of the blood of Uriah, and, in general, of the whole army. [270]
   But the term bloods in Hebrew may denote any capital crime, and, in my
   opinion, he is here to be considered as alluding to the sentence of
   death, to which he felt himself to be obnoxious, and from which he
   requests deliverance. By the righteousness of God, which he engages to
   celebrate, we are to understand his goodness; for this attribute, as
   usually ascribed to God in the Scriptures, does not so much denote the
   strictness with which he exacts vengeance, as his faithfulness in
   fulfilling the promises and extending help to all who seek him in the
   hour of need. There is much emphasis and vehemency in the mode of his
   address, O God! the God of my salvation, intimating at once how
   tremblingly he was alive to the danger of his situation, and how
   strongly his faith terminated upon God as the ground of his hope.
   Similar is the strain of the verse which follows. He prays that his
   lips may be opened; in other words, that God would afford him matter of
   praise. The meaning usually attached to the expression is, that God
   would so direct his tongue by the Spirit as to fit him for singing his
   praises. But though it is true that God must supply us with words, and
   that if he do not, we cannot fail to be silent in his praise, David
   seems rather to intimate that his mouth must be shut until God called
   him to the exercise of thanksgiving by extending pardon. In another
   place we find him declaring that a new song had been put in his mouth,
   (Psalm 40:3,)and it seems to be in this sense that he here desires his
   lips to be opened. He again signifies the gratitude which he would
   feel, and which he would express, intimating, that he sought the mercy
   of God with no other view than that he might become the herald of it to
   others. My mouth, he says emphatically, shall show forth thy praise.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [270] This opinion, although disapproved of by our Author, is very
   generally held by commentators. When blood is used in the plural number
   as here, it usually denotes murder or manslaughter, and the guilt
   following thereupon: as in Genesis 4:11, "The voice of thy brother's
   bloods crieth unto me from the ground;" 1 Chronicles 22:8, "Thou hast
   shed bloods abundantly;" and Psalm 9:13, "When he maketh inquisition
   for bloods." See also Psalm 106:38. "A man of bloods" is a bloody man,
   a man who is guilty of bloodshed, Psalm 5:6; 26:9; 59:2; and 55:23.
   David's conduct towards Uriah, forming as it did a dark and an
   atrocious deed of treachery and cruelty which has few parallels in the
   history of mankind, must, on his recovery to a sense of its real
   character, have inflicted on his soul an agony which cannot be told. He
   escaped being tried before an earthly tribunal; but his conscience told
   him that he stood at the bar of Heaven, laden with the guilt of murder;
   and he was convinced that the mercy of God alone could pardon him and
   purify his conscience. No wonder then that he cries out with such
   emphasis and earnestness, O God! thou God of my salvation! deliver me!
   The Chaldee reads, "Deliver me from the judgment of murder."

   Psalm 51:16-19

   16. For thou wilt not accept a sacrifice; though I should give [271] a
   burnt offering, it would not please thee. 17. The sacrifices of God are
   a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God! thou wilt not
   despise. 18. Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion; build thou the
   walls of Jerusalem. 19. Thou shalt then accept the sacrifices of
   righteousness, even the burnt-offering and whole oblation; then shall
   calves come upon thine altar.


   16. For thou wilt not accept a sacrifice By this language he expresses
   his confidence of obtaining pardon, although he brought nothing to God
   in the shape of compensation, but relied entirely upon the riches of
   Divine mercy. He confesses that he comes to God both poor and needy;
   but is persuaded that this will not prevent the success of his suit,
   because God attaches no importance to sacrifices. In this he indirectly
   reproves the Jews for an error which prevailed amongst them in all
   ages. In proclaiming that the sacrifices made expiation for sin, the
   Law had designed to withdraw them from all trust in their own works to
   the one satisfaction of Christ; but they presumed to bring their
   sacrifices to the altar as a price by which they hoped to procure their
   own redemption. In opposition to this proud and preposterous notion,
   David declares that God had no delight in sacrifices, [272] and that he
   had nothing to present which could purchase his favor. God had enjoined
   the observance of sacrifice, and David was far from neglecting it. He
   is not to be understood as asserting that the rite might warrantably be
   omitted, or that God would absolutely reject the sacrifices of his own
   institution, which, along with the other ceremonies of the Law, proved
   important helps, as we have already observed, both to David and the
   whole Church of God. He speaks of them as observed by the proud and the
   ignorant, under an impression of meriting the divine favor. Diligent as
   he was, therefore, in the practice of sacrifice, resting his whole
   dependence upon the satisfaction of Christ, who atoned for the sins of
   the world, he could yet honestly declare that he brought nothing to God
   in the shape of compensation, and that he trusted entirely to a
   gratuitous reconciliation. The Jews, when they presented their
   sacrifices, could not be said to bring anything of their own to the
   Lord, but must rather be viewed as borrowing from Christ the necessary
   purchase-money of redemption. They were passive, not active, in this
   divine service.

   17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. He had shown that
   sacrifices have no such efficacy in procuring the Divine favor as the
   Jews imagined; and now he declares that he needed to bring nothing
   whatever to God but a contrite and humbled heart. Nothing more is
   necessary, on the part of the sinner, than to prostrate himself in
   supplication for Divine mercy. The plural number is used in the verse
   to express more forcibly the truth, that the sacrifice of repentance is
   enough in itself without any other. Had he said no more than that this
   kind of sacrifice was peculiarly acceptable to God, the Jews might
   easily have evaded his argument by alleging that this might be true,
   and yet other sacrifices be equally agreeable in his sight; just as the
   Papists in our own day mix up the grace of God with their own works,
   rather than submit to receive a gratuitous pardon for their sins. In
   order to exclude every idea of a pretended satisfaction, David
   represents contrition of heart as comprehending in itself the whole sum
   of acceptable sacrifices. And in using the term sacrifices of God, he
   conveys a tacit reproof to the proud hypocrite, who sets a high value
   upon such sacrifices as are of his own unauthorised fancy, when he
   imagines that by means of them he can propitiate God. But here a
   difficulty may be started. "If the contrite heart," it may be said,
   "hold a higher place in the estimation of God than all sacrifices, does
   it not follow that we acquire pardon by our penitence, and that thus it
   ceases to be gratuitous?" In reply to this, I might observe, that David
   is not speaking at this time of the meritorious condition by which
   pardon is procured, but, on the contrary, asserting our absolute
   destitution of merit by enjoining humiliation and contrition of spirit,
   in opposition to everything like an attempt to render a compensation to
   God. The man of broken spirit is one who has been emptied of all
   vain-glorious confidence, and brought to acknowledge that he is
   nothing. The contrite heart abjures the idea of merit, and has no
   dealings with God upon the principle of exchange. Is it objected, that
   faith is a more excellent sacrifice that that which is here commended
   by the Psalmist, and of greater efficacy in procuring the Divine favor,
   as it presents to the view of God that Savior who is the true and only
   propitiation? I would observe, that faith cannot be separated from the
   humility of which David speaks. This is such a humility as is
   altogether unknown to the wicked. They may tremble in the presence of
   God, and the obstinacy and rebellion of their hearts may be partially
   restrained, but they still retain some remainders of inward pride.
   Where the spirit has been broken, on the other hand, and the heart has
   become contrite, through a felt sense of the anger of the Lord, a man
   is brought to genuine fear and self-loathing, with a deep conviction
   that of himself he can do or deserve nothing, and must be indebted
   unconditionally for salvation to Divine mercy. That this should be
   represented by David as constituting all which God desires in the shape
   of sacrifice, need not excite our surprise. He does not exclude faith,
   he does not condescend upon any nice division of true penitence into
   its several parts, but asserts in general, that the only way of
   obtaining the favor of God is by prostrating ourselves with a wounded
   heart at the feet of his Divine mercy, and supplicating his grace with
   ingenuous confessions of our own helplessness.

   18 Do good to Zion in thy good pleasure: build thou the walls of
   Jerusalem [273] From prayer in his own behalf he now proceeds to offer
   up supplications for the collective Church of God, a duty which he may
   have felt to be the more incumbent upon him from the circumstance of
   his having done what he could by his fall to ruin it, Raised to the
   throne, and originally anointed to be king for the very purpose of
   fostering the Church of God, he had by his disgraceful conduct nearly
   accomplished its destruction. Although chargeable with this guilt, he
   now prays that God would restore it in the exercise of his free mercy.
   He makes no mention of the righteousness of others, but rests his plea
   entirely upon the good pleasure of God, intimating that the Church,
   when at any period it has been brought low, must be indebted for its
   restoration solely to Divine grace. Jerusalem was already built, but
   David prays that God would build it still farther for he knew that it
   fell far short of being complete, so long as it wanted the temple,
   where he had promised to establish the Ark of his Covenant, and also
   the royal palace. We learn from the passage, that it is God's own work
   to build the Church. "His foundation," says the Psalmist elsewhere, "is
   in the holy mountains," (Psalm 87:1.) We are not to imagine that David
   refers simply to the Church as a material structure, but must consider
   him as having his eye fixed upon the spiritual temple, which cannot be
   raised by human skill or industry. It is true, indeed, that men will
   not make progress even in the building of material walls, unless their
   labor be blessed from above; but the Church is in a peculiar sense the
   erection of God, who has founded it upon the earth in the exercise of
   his mighty power, and who will exalt it higher than the heavens. In
   this prayer David does not contemplate the welfare of the Church for a
   short period merely, but prays that God would preserve and advance it
   till the coming of Christ. And here, may it not justly excite our
   surprise, to find one who, in the preceding part of the psalm, had
   employed the language of distress and almost of despair, now inspired
   with the confidence necessary for commending the whole Church to the
   care of God? How comes it about, may we not ask, that one who so
   narrowly escaped destruction himself, should now appear as a guide to
   conduct others to salvation? In this we have a striking proof, that,
   provided we obtain reconciliation with God, we may not only expect to
   be inspired with confidence in praying for our own salvation, but may
   hope to be admitted as intercessors in behalf of others, and even to be
   advanced to the higher honor still, of commending into the hands of God
   the glory of the Redeemer's kingdom.

   19 Then shalt thou accept sacrifices of righteousness In these words
   there is an apparent, but only an apparent, inconsistency with others
   which he had used in the preceding context. He had declared sacrifices
   to be of no value when considered in themselves, but now he
   acknowledges them to be acceptable to God when viewed as expressions or
   symbols of faith, penitence, and thanksgiving. He calls them distinctly
   sacrifices of righteousness, right, warrantable, and such as are
   offered in strict accordance with the commandment of God. The
   expression is the same employed in Psalm 4:5, where David uses it with
   a tacit condemnation of those who gloried in the mere outward form of
   ceremonies. We find him again exciting himself and others by his
   example to the exercise of gratitude, and to the expression of it
   openly in the solemn assembly. Besides sacrifices in general, two
   particular kinds of sacrifice are specified. Although some consider
   klyl, calil, and vlh, olah, to be both of one signification, others
   maintain with more correctness, that the first is to be understood as
   meaning the priest's sacrifice, because in it the offering was consumed
   or burnt with fire. [274] In the enumeration which he makes, David
   designs to teach us that none of all the legal rites can find
   acceptance with God, unless they be used with a reference to the proper
   end of their institution. The whole of this verse has been figuratively
   applied by some to the kingdom of Christ, but the interpretation is
   unnatural and too refined. Thanksgivings are indeed called by Hosea
   "the calves of the lips," (Hosea 14:2;) but it seems evident that in
   the passage before us there are conjoined along with the frame or
   disposition of the heart those solemn ceremonies which constituted part
   of the ancient worship.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [271] The original word v'chnh, ve-etenah, which Calvin renders, Though
   I should give, is considered by some as a noun. "The common
   interpretation, Else would I give it thee," says Rogers, "is harsh.
   Gesenius attributes to the word 'chnh, with a slight difference in the
   punctuation, the sense of a gift, reward It is used only in Hosea 2:14.
   If this sense might be given to the word in this passage, the verse
   might be translated, For thou desirest no sacrifice or gift,
   [In] a burnt-offering thou hast no delight.'" Book of Psalms in Hebrew,
   volume 2, p. 208.

   [272] There may be another reason why David here affirms that God would
   not accept of a sacrifice, nor be pleased with a burnt-offering. No
   particular sacrifices were appointed by the Law of Moses to expiate the
   guilt of murder and adultery. The person who had perpetrated these
   crimes was, according to the Divine law, to be punished with death.
   David therefore may be understood as declaring, that it was utterly
   vain for him to think of resorting to sacrifices and burnt-offerings
   with a view to the expiation of his guilt; that his criminality was of
   such a character, that the ceremonial law made no provision for his
   deliverance from the doom which his deeds of horror deserved; and that
   the only sacrifices which would avail were those mentioned in the
   succeeding verse, "The sacrifices of a broken heart."

   [273] We have already considered Horsley's first objection, founded on
   the fourth verse, to the authenticity of the title of this psalm. His
   second and only other objection rests on the 18th verse. He thinks that
   the prayer, "Build thou the walls of Jerusalem," is more applicable to
   the time of the Babylonish captivity than to the time of David; and to
   the former period he refers the psalm. Calmet and Mudge are of the same
   opinion. Some learned Jewish interpreters, while they assign the psalm
   to the occasion mentioned in the title, conjecture that the 18th and
   19th verses were added by some Jewish bard in the time of the
   Babylonish captivity. This opinion is also held by Venema, Green,
   Street, French and Skinner. There does not, however, seem to be any
   sufficient ground for referring the poem, either in whole or in part,
   to that period. Neither the walls of Jerusalem, nor the buildings of
   Zion, as the royal palace, and the magnificent structure of the temple,
   which we know David had already contemplated for the worship of God, (2
   Samuel 7:1, etc.) were completed during his reign. This was only
   effected under the reign of his son Solomon, (1 Kings 3:1.) The prayer,
   then, in the 18th verse, might have a particular reference to the
   completion of these buildings, and especially to the rearing of the
   temple, in which sacrifices of unprecedented magnitude were to be
   offered. David's fears might easily suggest to him that his crimes
   might prevent the building of the temple which God had promised should
   be erected, (2 Samuel 7:13.) "The king forgets not," observes Bishop
   Horne, "to ask mercy for his people, as well as for himself; that so
   neither his own nor their sins might prevent either the building and
   flourishing of the earthly Jerusalem, or, what was of infinitely
   greater importance, the promised blessing of Messiah, who was to
   descend from him, and to rear the walls of the New Jerusalem."

   [274] Ainsworth reads, "the burnt-offering and the whole oblation;" and
   observes, that "The whole oblation, the calil, was a kind of oblation
   that was wholly and every whit given up in fire unto God, and differed
   from the ghnola, or burnt-offering, which was only of beasts or birds,
   Leviticus 1; whereas the calil was also of flour, called the
   meat-offering, but burned altogether, which the common meat-offerings
   were not, Leviticus 6:20, 22, 23. It was also of beasts, 1 Samuel 7:9."

   PSALM 52

   This psalm was composed by David at the time when the death of
   Abimelech and the other priests had spread universal terror among the
   people, indisposing them for lending any countenance to his cause, and
   when Doeg was triumphing in the successful issue of his information.
   Supported, even in these circumstances, by the elevating influence of
   faith, he inveighs against the cruel treachery of that unprincipled
   informer, and encourages himself by the reflection, that God, who is
   judge in heaven, will vindicate the interests of such as fear him, and
   punish the pride of the ungodly.

   To the chief singer. A Psalm of David for instruction; when Doeg the
   Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, that David had come into
   the house of Abimelech.

   I have already had occasion to observe that the term mskyl, maskil, is
   strictly affixed to those psalms in which David makes mention of having
   been chastised by God, or at least admonished, by some species of
   affliction, sent, like the rod of the schoolmaster, to administer
   correction. Of this we have examples in Psalms 32 and 42. As inscribed
   above the 45th psalm, its meaning is somewhat different. There, it
   seems designed to intimate to the reader that the song, although
   breathing of love, was not intended to please a mere wanton taste, but
   describes the spiritual marriage of Christ with his Church. In this and
   the following psalms, the term admits of being understood as signifying
   instruction, more particularly such as proceeds from correction; and
   David, by employing it, would evidently insinuate that he was at this
   time subjected to peculiar trials, sent to instruct him in the duty of
   placing an absolute trust in God. The portion of history to which the
   psalm refers is well known. When David had fled to Abimelech in Nob, he
   obtained provisions and the sword of Goliath from the hands of that
   priest, having concealed from him the real danger in which he stood,
   and pretended that he was executing a secret and important business of
   the king. Doeg, chief of the king's herdsmen, having conveyed
   intelligence of this to Saul, in expectation of a reward, was the means
   of drawing down the rage of the tyrant, not only upon that innocent
   individual, but the whole priesthood. [275] The bloody example which
   was thus made must have deterred the people from extending to David
   even the commonest offices of humanity, and every avenue of relief
   seemed shut upon the miserable exile. As Doeg triumphed in the success
   of his crime, and others might be tempted, by the reward which he had
   received, to meditate the ruin of David, we find him in this psalm
   animating his soul with divine consolations, and challenging his
   enemies with the audacity of their conduct.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 52:1-4

   1. Why boastest thou of thy wickedness, thou mighty man? The goodness
   of God endureth daily. 2. Thy tongue reckons up mischiefs, like a sharp
   razor, working deceitfully. 3. Thou lovest evil more than good, to
   speak lying rather than righteousness. Selah. 4. Thou lovest all words
   of deceit, O thou guileful tongue!


   1. Why boastest thou of thy wickedness? The success which crowned the
   treachery of Doeg must have tended considerably to stagger David's
   faith; and he seems to have adopted the strain of holy defiance with
   which the psalm commences, in order to arm himself more effectually
   against this temptation. He begins by charging Doeg with an aggravation
   of his guilt, in boasting of the power which he had acquired by an act
   of consummate villany. This power may have been sufficiently
   considerable to attract the notice which is here taken of it; for
   although he is only said to have been "master of the king's herdsmen,"
   the designation does not imply that he was personally occupied in
   herding cattle, but may have been an honorary title; as in modern
   courts we speak of "The Master of the Horse." he is reminded that there
   was no reason why he should applaud himself in his greatness, so long
   as he abused it to purposes of wickedness; nor why he should be vain of
   any new honor which the king might have conferred upon him in
   consideration of his late crime, as integrity is the only sure pathway
   to power and preferment. Any triumph which may be obtained by violence,
   treachery, or other unjustifiable means, is short-lived. In the second
   part of the verse, he points at the true cause of the blindness and
   stupidity that lead men to glory in their wickedness, which is, that
   they despise the poor and the humble; imagine that God will not
   condescend to interest himself in their behalf; and therefore embrace
   the occasion of oppressing them with impunity. They make no account of
   that providence which God exerts over his own children. David, in the
   exercise of a holy confidence, challenges such proud boasters with
   dishonoring the goodness of God; and as the Divine goodness does not
   always pursue the same even course -- occasionally appears to suffer an
   interruption, and sometimes seems as if it were cut off altogether,
   David repels any temptation which this might suggest, by asserting
   that, whatever appearances may say to the contrary, it is daily
   exercised. This is evidently the meaning which he intends to convey,
   that any partial obstructions which may take place in the display of it
   can never prevent its constant renewal. He was confident that he would
   experience, in the future, what he had found in the past; for God
   cannot become weary in helping his people, or alleviating their
   miseries; and although he may suffer them again and again to fall into
   affliction, he is always equally ready to extend them the deliverance
   which they need.

   2. Thy tongue reckons up mischiefs David is not to be considered as
   here venting a flood of reproaches against his adversary, as many who
   have been unjustly injured are in the habit of doing, merely to gratify
   a feeling of revenge. He brings these charges against him in the sight
   of God, with a view to encourage himself in the hopefulness of his own
   cause: for it is plain that the farther our enemies proceed in the
   practice of iniquity, they proportionally provoke the anger of the
   Lord, and are nearer to that destruction which must issue in our
   deliverance. His object, therefore, is not to blacken the character of
   Doeg in the estimation of the world, but rather to set before his own
   eyes the divine punishment which the flagrant offenses he specifies
   were certain to draw down upon his head. Amongst these he singles out,
   as more especially worthy of reprobation, the hidden treachery with
   which he had been chargeable in accomplishing the destruction of the
   priesthood. Adverting to his secret and malicious information, he
   likens his tongue to a sharp razor, as elsewhere, Psalm 120:4, the
   tongues of the wicked are compared to "sharp arrows." It is added,
   working deceitfully, which words are considered by some as referring to
   the razor which cuts subtilely, and not with an open wound like a
   sword; but perhaps they may be construed with more propriety as
   applying to the tongue, [276] although there can be no doubt of the
   reason of the comparison.

   The term vl, balang, in verse fourth, which has been translated
   destruction, I prefer understanding in the sense of hiding or
   concealment. He seems to allude to the drawing back of the tongue when
   we swallow; and under this figure, to describe the deceitfulness of
   Doeg's words, by which he devoured the unsuspecting and the innocent.
   [277] The great design of David, as I have already remarked in the
   preceding verses, is to encourage himself in the hope of deliverance by
   dwelling upon the extreme character of that wickedness which his enemy
   had displayed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [276] According to the first sense, the meaning is, that as a razor
   cuts so easily, that the wound is at first hardly perceptible, in the
   same manner, the deceitful tongue works its purposes of mischief before
   the objects which it means to ruin are conscious of their danger. It is
   like a sharp razor, that cuts the throat before a man is aware of it.
   "If, however, we take the words, thou workest deceitfully, as being
   descriptive not of the razor but of the tongue, the sense will be, that
   such a tongue is capable of inflicting deep and dreadful wounds like a
   sharp razor." -- Walford.

   [277] "vl, balang, is to swallow, to devour, with the idea of
   eagerness, greediness." -- Gesenius

   Psalm 52:5-7

   5. God shall likewise destroy thee for ever: he shall take thee away,
   and pluck thee out of thy dwelling-place, and root thee out of the land
   of the living. Selah 6. The righteous also shall see, and fear, and
   shall laugh at him. 7. Lo! this is the man that made not God his
   strength; and trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened
   himself in his wickedness.


   5 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever. From these words it is made
   still more evident that his object in dwelling upon the aggravated
   guilt of Doeg, was to prove the certainty of his approaching doom, and
   this rather for his own conviction and comfort, than with a view to
   alarming the conscience of the offender. Accordingly, he declares his
   persuasion that God would not allow his treachery to pass unpunished,
   though he might for a time connive at the perpetration of it. The
   ungodly are disposed, so long as their prosperity continues, to indulge
   in undisturbed security; and the saint of God, when he sees the power
   of which they are possessed, and witnesses their proud contempt of the
   divine judgments, is too apt to be overwhelmed with unbelieving
   apprehensions. But in order to establish his mind in the truth which he
   announces, it is observable that the Psalmist heaps one expression upon
   another, -- God shall destroy thee, take thee away, pluck thee out,
   root thee out, -- as if by this multiplicity of words he would convince
   himself more effectually, that God was able to overthrow this adversary
   with all his boasted might and authority. [278] In adding that God
   would root him out of his dwelling-place or tent, [279] and out of the
   land of the living, he insinuates that the wicked will be destroyed by
   God, however securely they may seem to repose ir the nest of some
   comfortable mansion, and in the vain hope of living upon earth for
   ever. Possibly he may allude, in mentioning a tent, to the profession
   of Doeg, as shepherds have their dwelling in tents.

   6 The righteous also shall see, and fear [280] He here adduces, as
   another reason why the ruin of Doeg might be expected, that an
   important end would be obtained by it, in so far as it would promote
   religion in the hearts of the Lord's people, and afford them a
   refreshing display of the Divine justice. Should it take place, it
   would be witnessed by the ungodly as well as by the righteous; but
   there are two reasons why the Psalmist represents it as being seen
   especially by the latter. The wicked are incapable of profiting by the
   judgments of God, being blind to the plainest manifestations which he
   has made of himself in his works, and it was only the righteous
   therefore who could see it. Besides, the great end which God has in
   view, when he prostrates the pride of the ungodly, is the comfort of
   his own people, that he may show to them the care with which he watches
   over their safety. It is they, therefore, whom David represents as
   witnessing this spectacle of Divine justice. And when he says that they
   would fear, it is not meant that they would tremble, or experience any
   slavish apprehension, but that their reverential regard for God would
   be increased by this proof of his care of their interests. When left
   exposed to the injurious treatment of their enemies, they are apt to be
   distressed with doubts as to the concern which he takes in the
   government of the world. But such illustrations to the contrary have
   the effect of quickening their discouraged zeal, and promoting that
   fear which is by no means inconsistent with the joy spoken of in the
   close of the verse. They are led to reverence him the more when they
   see that he is the avenger of cruelty and injustice: on the other hand,
   when they perceive that he appears in defense of their cause, and joins
   common battle with them against their adversaries, they are naturally
   filled with the most triumphant joy. The beautiful play upon the words
   see and fear, in the Hebrew, cannot be transferred to our language; the
   form of the expression intimates that they would see, and see
   effectually.

   7. Lo! this is the man that made not God his strength Some think that
   these words are given as what should afterwards be proverbially applied
   to Doeg; but they would not appear to have been intended in that
   restricted signification. They merely express the improvement which the
   people of God would make of the judgment. It would teach them, on the
   one hand, to be patient under the insolence of the ungodly, which is so
   speedily humbled; and, on the other, to beware of indulging a similarly
   infatuated spirit themselves. They would laugh at their destruction,
   yet not in the way of insulting over them, but rejoicing more and more
   in the confidence of the help of God, and denying themselves more
   cheerfully to the vain pleasures of this world. This is the lesson to
   be learned from such dispensations of providence: they should recall
   our wandering affections to God. The verse is introduced with an
   exclamation, Lo! this is the man, etc.; for David would have us to look
   upon this one instance as representing to our eyes, in a vivid manner,
   the end of all who despise the Lord; and it may be remarked, that it is
   no small point of practical wisdom thus to generalise individual
   providences. The two clauses, made not God his strength, and, trusted
   in the abundance of his riches, stand mutually connected; for none can
   be said sincerely to repose upon God but he who has been emptied of all
   confidence in his own resources. So long as men imagine that they have
   something of their own in which they can boast, they will never resort
   to God: just in proportion as we arrogate to ourselves do we derogate
   from him; and it is not only wealth, but any other earthly possession,
   which, by engrossing our confidence, may prevent us from inquiring
   after the Lord. The noun hvh, havah, which most interpreters have
   rendered wickedness, [281] and some slaughter or destruction, seems, in
   this place, rather to mean substance. [282] Such repetitions of the
   same sentiment in different words are common with the Psalmist; and,
   according to this translation, the verse will flow connectedly,
   reading, that the man who trusts in his riches, and strengthens himself
   in his substance, defrauds God of his just glory.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [278] "Wonderful," says Bishop Horne, "is the force of the verbs in the
   original, which convey to us the four ideas of laying prostrate,'
   dissolving as by fire,' sweeping away as with a besom,' and totally
   extirpating root and branch,' as a tree eradicated from the spot on
   which it grew." The second verb, ychtk, yachtecha, Bythner explains,
   "will snatch thee away, as one snatches fire from a hearth. From chth,
   chatheh, he snatched off live coals or fire from one place to another."

   [279] There is another interpretation of this expression which may here
   be stated. It has been thought that the allusion is to God's
   tabernacle. "m'hl, meohel," says Hammond, "is literally from the
   tabernacle,' not from thy dwelling-place:' and so the LXX. render it,
   Apo skenomatos,' from the tabernacle;' and though the Latin, and
   Syriac, and Arabic, have added tuo, thy, yet neither will the Hebrew
   bear, nor do the Chaldee acknowledge it, who read by way of paraphrase,
   He shall cause thee to depart from inhabiting in the place of the
   Schechina, or tabernacle, the place of God's presence.'" Hammond
   supposes that the expression is to be understood "of the censure of
   excommunication, which in the last and highest degree was Schammatha,
   delivering up the offender to the hand of heaven to be cut off, himself
   and his posterity." "Doeg," says Archbishop Secker, "had no office in
   the tabernacle; but it seems, by his history, that he frequented it,
   which he might do to seem a good man. And there seems an opposition
   between his being plucked out of God's dwelling-place, and David's
   continuing in the house of God, verse eighth."

   [280] French and Skinner read, "The righteous shall see it, and feel
   reverence; -- feel reverence, i.e., in the punishment of this wicked
   man, find additional reason to reverence God, and to observe his
   righteous laws."

   [281] If this is the true rendering, there may be a reference to the
   expectations which Doeg had entertained of increasing his power and
   influence by maliciously injuring David, as he would thereby obtain, in
   a high degree, the favor of Saul.

   [282] This is the marginal reading in our English Bible. As he was
   Saul's chief herdsman, it is probable that his riches consisted chiefly
   in cattle.

   Psalm 52:8-9

   8. But I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: I have hoped
   in the goodness of God for ever and ever. 9. I will praise thee for
   ever, because thou hast done it. I will wait on thy name, for it is
   good before thy meek ones.


   8 But I am like a green olive-tree [283] We have seen that David was
   enabled, by the exercise of faith, to look down upon the worldly
   grandeur of Doeg with a holy contempt; and now we find him rising
   superior to all that was presently afflictive in his own condition.
   Though, to appearance, he more resembled the withered trunk of a tree
   which rots upon the ground, he compares himself, in the confidence of
   coming prosperity, to a green olive. I need not say that the
   destruction of Doeg could only communicate comfort to his mind, in the
   way of convincing him that God was the avenging judge of human cruelty,
   and leading him to infer that, as he had punished his wrongs, so he
   would advance him to renewed measures of prosperity. From his language,
   it appears that he could conceive of no higher felicity in his
   condition than being admitted amongst the number of the worshippers of
   God, and engaging in the exercises of devotion. This was characteristic
   of his spirit. We have already had occasion to see that he felt his
   banishment from the sanctuary of God more keenly than separation from
   his consort, the loss of worldly substance, or the dangers and
   hardships of the wilderness. The idea of an allusion being here made,
   by way of contrast, to Doeg, who came to the tabernacle of the Lord
   merely as a spy, and under hypocritical pretexts, is strained and
   far-fetched. It is more natural to suppose that David distinguishes
   himself from all his enemies, without exception, intimating that,
   though he was presently removed from the tabernacle, he would soon be
   restored to it; and that they who boasted of possessing, or rather
   monopolising, the house of God, would be rooted out of it with
   disgrace. And here let us engrave the useful lesson upon our hearts,
   that we should consider it the great end of our existence to be found
   numbered amongst the worshippers of God; and that we should avail
   ourselves of the inestimable privilege of the stated assemblies of the
   Church, which are necessary helps to our infirmity, and means of mutual
   excitement and encouragement. By these, and our common Sacraments, the
   Lord, who is one God, and who designed that we should be one in him, is
   training us up together in the hope of eternal life, and in the united
   celebration of his holy name. Let us learn with David to prefer a place
   in the house of God to all the lying vanities of this world. He adds
   the reason why he should be like the green olive-tree -- because he
   hoped in the goodness of God; for the causal particle appears to be
   understood. And in this he adverts to the contrast between him and his
   enemies. They might flourish for a time, spread their branches far and
   wide, and shoot themselves up to a gigantic stature, but would speedily
   wither away, because they had no root in the goodness of God; whereas
   he was certain to derive from this source ever renewed supplies of sap
   and vigor. As the term of his earthly trials might be protracted, and
   there was a danger that he might sink under their long continuance,
   unless his confidence should extend itself far into futurity, he
   declares expressly that he would not presume to prescribe times to God,
   and that his hopes were stretched into eternity. It followed that he
   surrendered himself entirely to God in all that regarded this life or
   his death. The passage puts us in possession of the grand distinction
   between the genuine children of God and those who are hypocrites. They
   are to be found together in the Church, as the wheat is mingled with
   the chaff on the same threshing-floor; but the one class abides for
   ever in the steadfastness of a well-founded hope, while the other is
   driven away in the vanity of its false confidences.

   9. I will praise thee, etc. He concludes the psalm with thanksgiving,
   and shows that he is sincere in this, by the special acknowledgement
   which he makes of the fact that this had been the work of God. Such is
   the corruption of the human heart, that out of a hundred who profess
   gratitude to God with their lips, scarcely one man seriously reflects
   upon the benefits which he has received as coming from his hand. David
   declares, therefore, that it was entirely owing to the divine
   protection that he had escaped from the treachery of Doeg, and from all
   his subsequent dangers, and promises to retain a grateful sense of it
   throughout the whole of his life. There is no religious duty in which
   it does not become us to manifest a spirit of perseverance; but we need
   to be especially enjoined to it in the duty of thanksgiving, disposed
   as we are so speedily to forget our mercies, and occasionally to
   imagine that the gratitude of a few days is a sufficient tribute for
   benefits which deserve to be kept in everlasting remembrance. He speaks
   of joining the exercise of hope with that of gratitude; for to wait on
   the name of God is synonymous with patiently expecting his mercy even
   when there is least appearance of its being granted, and trusting in
   his word, whatever delays there may be in the fulfillment of it. He
   encourages himself in the belief that his hope will not be vain, by
   reflecting that the name of God is good before his saints Some read,
   because it is good before thy saints; that is, to hope in the divine
   name, (Psalm 118:8.) But the other reading appears to me to be the most
   simple and natural, expressing the truth, that God will not frustrate
   the expectations of his people, because his goodness towards them is
   always conspicuous. The name of God may be detested by the wicked, and
   the very sound of it be sufficient to strike terror into their hearts;
   but David asserts it to be a sweet name in the experience of all his
   people. They are here called his meek ones, because, as I have
   [11]remarked in commenting upon Psalm 16:3, they reflect in their
   character the kindness and beneficence of their Father in heaven.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [283] Our English Bible also reads, "like a green olive-tree;" but it
   would be more correct to translate, "I am like a flourishing, or
   vigorous olive-tree." The original word, rnn, raanan, has no reference
   to the color of the tree, but to its fresh, vigouous and flourish
   condition. Hence this word is used, in Psalm 92:11, to express "fresh
   oil;" and in Daniel 4:4, to denote the prosperous condition of
   Nebuchadnezzar, "I was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my
   palace." The fact is, that the color of the olive-tree, so far from
   being of a bright and lively green, is dark, disagreeable, and
   yellowish. Travellers, when they have seen this tree, have experienced
   a feeling of disappointment in not finding it to possess the vivid
   verdure which they had been led to expect from the description given of
   it in the Scriptures. An excellent English traveler, Mr Sharpe, writing
   from Italy, thus expresses himself on this subject: "The fields, and
   indeed the whole face of Tuscany, are in a manner covered with
   olive-trees; but the olive-tree does not answer the character I had
   conceived of it. The royal Psalmist, and some of the sacred writers,
   speak with rapture of the green olive-tree,' so that I expected a
   beautiful green; and I confess to you I was wretchedly disappointed to
   find its hue resembling that of our hedges when they are covered with
   dust." But this disappointment which Mr Sharpe felt arose not from
   overcharged or exaggerated colouring on the part of the sacred writers,
   but from his not understanding the meaning of their language. The
   beauty of the olive-tree is represented in other parts of Scripture as
   consisting, not in the greenness of its foliage, but in the spread of
   its branches, (Hosea 14:6.) -- Harmer's Observations, volume 3, pp.
   255-257. The propriety and beauty of the comparison which David here
   makes appears from the fact that the olive is an evergreen, and is
   also, considering its size, long-lived. While, in the 5th verse, he had
   predicted the speedy and total destruction of Doeg, comparing him to a
   tree plucked up by the roots, he, in contrast with this, represents
   himself as like a young, vigorous olive-tree, which had long to live
   and flourish; confidently expecting to obtain that outward peace and
   prosperity which God had promised him, and, along with this, the
   enjoyment of all spiritual blessings.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [275] The history of this transaction is recorded in 1 Samuel 21:1-7,
   and 22:9-19. It affords a strong evidence of the hatred which Saul bore
   to David, and of his savage cruelty to order the execution of
   eighty-five priests for no crime; and what a monster of iniquity must
   Doeg have been, who executed this command when not another individual
   in all Saul's company would do it, and who, in addition to this, "smote
   the city of the priests with the edge of the sword, both men and women,
   children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep?" "If we are
   confounded," says Walford, "by the savage ferocity of a prince who
   could order the execution of eighty-five persons of most venerable
   station, for a crime which existed alone in his disturbed imagination,
   we shall feel disposed to execrate the ruthless villain who could
   imbrue his hands in the blood of so many innocent victims; and we shall
   be ready to draw the conclusion, that both Saul and Doeg were prompted
   to this deed of atrocious cruelty, not merely by their hatred of David,
   but by a malevolence, almost without parallel, against the ministers of
   religion, and which rendered conspicuous their contempt and hatred for
   God himself. It can excite little surprise to find David saying, as he
   does, in the next psalm, The fool saith in his heart, There is no
   God.'"

   [284] Some slight differences will be found, on comparison, between
   this and the 14th psalm; the chief of which is in the 5th verse. For
   Calvin's explanation of this verse, see [12]volume 1, p. 199. It is not
   easy to say whether these variations are owing to transcribers, or
   whether they were made by some prophetic bard, who, during some
   afflictive period of Jewish history, adapted the 14th psalm, by a few
   alterations, to circumstances different from those for which it was
   originally composed. Theodoret is of this last opinion, and refers it
   to the alarm created by Sennacherib's invasion under the reign of
   Hezekiah; others think it was written during the captivity -- a
   conjecture which is founded on the last verse, "O that the salvation of
   Israel were come out of Zion!"

   [285] What mhlt, mahalath, signifies, in the title of this and the 88th
   psalm, must be uncertain, the word not being found elsewhere. It is
   most probably the name of an instrument on which the psalm was to be
   sung; and it may fitly be deduced from chll, perforavit, or incidit,
   either from the hollowness of the instrument, or farther, from the
   holes cut in it; in which respect chlyl is ordinarily used for fistula,
   or tibia, a pipe." -- Hammond

   PSALM 54

   David has recorded in this psalm the prayers which he offered up to God
   when he heard of his having been betrayed by the Ziphites, and was
   reduced to a situation of extreme danger. It cannot fail to impress us
   with a high idea of his indomitable faith, thus to find him calling
   upon the name of God in the immediate prospect of death.

   To the chief musician on Neginoth. A Psalm of David for instruction:
   when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself
   with us?

   We know from the sacred history that David frequently concealed himself
   in that part of the wilderness which adjoined to the Ziphites. It
   appears (1 Samuel 23:19; 26:1) that he was betrayed by them on two
   different occasions; and he takes notice of the particular
   circumstances in which the psalm was written, to teach us that we
   should never despair of divine help even in the worst situation.
   Surrounded as he was by hostile troops, and hemmed in on every side by
   apparently inevitable destruction, we cannot but admire the rare and
   heroical intrepidity which he displayed in committing himself, by
   prayer, to the Almighty. It might have appeared just as credible that
   God could bring the dead out of the grave, as that he could preserve
   him in such circumstances; for it seemed impossible that he should
   escape from the cave where he was concealed with his life.

   Psalm 54:1-3

   1. Save me, O God! by thy name, and judge me by thy strength. 2. Hear
   my prayer, O God! give ear to the words of my mouth. 3. For strangers
   are risen up against me, and the terrible ones have sought after my
   soul they have not set God before them. Selah.


   1. Save me, O God! As David was at this time placed beyond the reach of
   human assistance, he must be understood as praying to be saved by the
   name and the power of God, In an emphatical sense, or by these in
   contradistinction to the usual means of deliverance. Though all help
   must ultimately come from God, there are ordinary methods by which he
   generally extends it. When these fail, and every earthly stay is
   removed, he must then take the work into his own hands. It was in such
   a situation that David here fled to the saints' last asylum, and sought
   to be saved by a miracle of divine power. By appealing, in the second
   part of the verse, to God as his judge, he asserts his uprightness. And
   it must strike us all, that in asking the divine protection it is
   indispensably prerequisite we should be convinced of the goodness of
   our cause, as it would argue the greatest profanity in any to expect
   that God should patronise iniquity. David was encouraged to pray for
   deliverance by the goodness of his cause and his consciousness of
   integrity; nor did he entertain a single doubt, that on representing
   this to God he would act the part of his defender, and punish the
   cruelty and treachery of his enemies.

   2. Hear my prayer, O God! The language is expressive of his
   earnestness. He was led to this fervor of supplication by the extremity
   of his present circumstances, which is alluded to in the following
   verse, where he complains of being surrounded by men fierce, barbarous,
   and unrestrained by a sense of religion. There was no necessity for his
   informing God of a fact which was already known to him; but he
   disburdens his own heart by venting the cause of his fear and
   disquietude. By calling his enemies strangers, [288] he seems to refer
   to their barbarity, whether he applied the name to the Ziphites only,
   or, in general, to the whole army of Saul. Others consider him, in this
   term, to advert to their degeneracy as children of Abraham; and it is
   true that the Jews are repeatedly stigmatised by the prophets under
   this form of expression, when they had cast themselves out of the
   Church of God by their profligacy or impiety. But in this passage it
   seems to be used in a different sense. As even enemies are accustomed,
   in some measure, to respect the ties of kindred and relationship, David
   would point out to us the monstrous inhumanity of the men who now
   surrounded him, by the fact that they assaulted him as strangers, as
   persons who had never known him, or as if he had been born in some
   distant part of the world. He calls them, also, terrible ones, [289]
   not mighty, or powerful ones, as some have rendered the word; for that
   falls short of the meaning intended by David, which was, that they were
   divested of all humanity, and ready to rush upon him like wild beasts.
   Hence the fear with which he resorted to the protection of God. He
   adds, that they sought after his soul, to denote that nothing would
   content their insatiable cruelty but his life. And the better to
   express the unbridled nature of their fury, he tells us that they had
   no respect to God. The only thing which could be supposed, in the
   circumstances, to act as a restraint upon their minds, was the
   consideration of there being a judge in heaven to whom they were
   amenable for their conduct; and being insensible to this, what
   moderation could be expected of them?
     __________________________________________________________________

   [288] For zrym, zairim, strangers, upwards of twenty MSS. have zdym,
   zoidim, the proud; and this is the sense given by the Chaldee
   Paraphrast. As the Ziphites were Jews, and of the same tribe with
   David, (Joshua 15:24,) and therefore not, strictly speaking,
   "strangers," some think that the proud is the true reading. But the
   Ziphites, as our Author justly observes, may be called "strangers,"
   because they acted towards David the part of strangers and enemies, in
   seeking to deliver him into the hands of his unjust and cruel
   persecutor, Saul.

   [289] Ainsworth reads, "Daunting tyrants." "Terrible dismayers, as Saul
   and his retinue, whose terror daunted many. See Psalm 10:18."

   Psalm 54:4-7

   4. Behold! God is my helper; the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
   5. He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.
   6. I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O God!
   for it is good. 7. For he hath delivered me out of all trouble; and
   mine eye hath seen upon my adversaries. [290]


   4. Behold! God is my helper Such language as this may show us that
   David did not direct his prayers at random into the air, but offered
   them in the exercise of a lively faith. There is much force in the
   demonstrative adverb. He points, as it were, with the finger, to that
   God who stood at his side to defend him; and was not this an amazing
   illustration of the power with which faith can surmount all obstacles,
   and glance, in a moment, from the depths of despair to the very throne
   of God? He was a fugitive amongst the dens of the earth, and even there
   in hazard of his life -- how, then, could he speak of God as being near
   to him? He was pressed down to the very mouth of the grave; and how
   could he recognize the gracious presence of God? He was trembling in
   the momentary expectation of being destroyed; and how is it possible
   that he can triumph in the certain hope that Divine help will presently
   be extended to him? In numbering God amongst his defenders, we must not
   suppose that he assigns him a mere common rank amongst the men who
   supported his cause, which would have been highly derogatory to his
   glory. He means that God took part with those, such as Jonathan and
   others, who were interested in his welfare. These might be few in
   number, possessed of little power, and cast down with fears; but he
   believed that, under the guidance and protection of the Almighty, they
   would prove superior to his enemies: or, perhaps, we may view him as
   referring, in the words, to his complete destitution of all human
   defenders, and asserting that the help of God would abundantly
   compensate for all. [291]

   5. He shall reward evil unto mine enemies As the verb ysyv, yashib, may
   be rendered he shall cause to return, [292] it seems to point not only
   at the punishment, but the kind of punishment, which would be awarded
   to his enemies, in the recoiling of their wicked machinations upon
   their own heads. Some give an optative signification to the verb,
   understanding the words to express a wish or prayer; but I see no
   reason why it should not be taken strictly in the future tense, and
   imagine that David intimates his certain expectation that this favor,
   which he had already prayed for, would be granted. It is by no means
   uncommon to find the prayers of the Psalmist intersected with sentences
   of this kind, inserted for the purpose of stimulating his faith, as
   here, where he announces the general truth, that God is the righteous
   judge who will recompense the wicked. With the view of confirming his
   hopes, he adverts particularly to the truth of God; for nothing can
   support us in the hour of temptation, when the Divine deliverance may
   be long delayed, but a firm persuasion that God is true, and that he
   cannot deceive us by his divine promises. His confidence of obtaining
   his request was grounded upon the circumstance that God could no more
   deny his word than deny himself.

   6. I will freely sacrifice unto thee. According to his usual custom, he
   engages, provided deliverance should be granted, to feel a grateful
   sense of it; and there can be no doubt that he here promises also to
   return thanks to God, in a formal manner, when he should enjoy an
   opportunity of doing so. Though God principally looks to the inward
   sentiment of the heart, that would not excuse the neglect of such rites
   as the Law had prescribed. He would testify his sense of the favor
   which he received, in the manner common to all the people of God, by
   sacrifices, and be thus the means of exciting others to their duty by
   his example. And he would sacrifice freely: by which he does not allude
   to the circumstance, that sacrifices of thanksgiving were at the option
   of worshippers, but to the alacrity and cheerfulness with which he
   would pay his vow when he had escaped his present dangers. The
   generality of men promise largely to God so long as they are under the
   present pressure of affliction, but are no sooner relieved than they
   relapse into that carelessness which is natural to them, and forget the
   goodness of the Lord. But David engages to sacrifice freely, and in
   another manner than the hypocrite, whose religion is the offspring of
   servility and constraint. We are taught by the passage that, in coming
   into the presence of God, we cannot look for acceptance unless we bring
   to his service a willing mind. The last clause of this verse, and the
   verse which follows, evidently refer to the time when the Psalmist had
   obtained the deliverance which he sought. The whole psalm, it is true,
   must have been written after his deliverance; but up to this point, it
   is to be considered as recording the form of prayer which he used when
   yet exposed to the danger. We are now to suppose him relieved from his
   anxieties, and subjoining a fresh expression of his gratitude: nor is
   it improbable that, he refers to mercies which he had experienced at
   other periods of his history, and which were recalled to his memory by
   the one more immediately brought under our notice in the preceding
   verses; so that he is to be understood as declaring, in a more general
   sense, that the name of God was good, and that he had been delivered
   out of all trouble I have already adverted, in a former psalm, (Psalm
   52:6,) to the sense in which the righteous are said to see the
   destruction of their enemies. It is such a sight of the event as is
   accompanied with joy and comfort; and should any inquire, whether it is
   allowable for the children of God to feel pleasure in witnessing the
   execution of Divine judgments upon the wicked, the answer is obvious,
   that all must depend upon the motive by which they are influenced. If
   their satisfaction proceed in any measure from the gratification of a
   depraved feeling, it must be condemned; but there is certainly a pure
   and unblameable delight which we may feel in looking upon such
   illustrations of the divine justice.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [290] The translators of our English Bible have supposed an ellipsis
   here; and hence they supply "only desire." Calvin, in his translation
   of the verse, makes no supplement, but understands it in a similar
   sense, "My eye hath seen punishment upon my adversaries;" just as it is
   said in Psalm 91:8, "With thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the
   reward of the wicked." But if we read the words literally, without any
   supplement, and as they are rendered by the LXX. and the Syriac, "My
   eyes beheld, or looked upon mine enemies," they will be susceptible of
   a very good and natural meaning. David's enemies were not at this time
   destroyed; but Saul, when he had reached the farther side of the
   mountain where David lay concealed, and was about to seize his victim,
   having heard that the Philistines invaded the land, hastened in
   confusion to repel the invaders. The meaning of David's language,
   therefore, may be, that he was so near Saul and his army as to behold
   them marching away, which may be easily conceived, when it is
   considered that "Saul went on this side of the mountain Maon, and David
   and his men on that side of the mountains" (1 Samuel. 23:26.)

   [291] The phrase, 'dny vsmky, Adonai besomkey, which Calvin renders,
   "The Lord is with them that uphold," is translated by Hammond, "The
   Lord among the sustainers;" and he remarks, that this form of
   expression, which is not unusual among the Hebrews, signifies no more
   than "God is my upholder; not one of many upholders, but my only
   upholder." Thus, when Jephtha (Judges 11:35) tells his daughter, "Thou
   art among the troublers of me," or "one of them that trouble me," the
   meaning simply is, that she very much grieved and troubled him. So
   Psalm 55:18, "There were many with me;" i e., "God was with me," which
   is as good as the greatest multitude. This is the sense in which the
   learned Castellio understands the passage, rendering it, "Dominus is
   est qui mihi vitam sustentat;" "The Lord is he who sustains my life;"
   and he defends it by the above and like arguments. With this the
   Septuagint agrees: "Kurios antileptor tos psnchos mou," "The Lord is
   the defender of my soul;" and also the Syriac, Arabic, and Aethiopic.

   [292] French and Skinner read, "May their mischief return upon those
   who watch me;" and observe, "that their mischief in Hebrew is the evil,
   and that the meaning is, the very evil which they devised against me.
   Compare Psalm 7:16."

   PSALM 55

   Many interpreters have thought that this psalm refers to the conspiracy
   of Absalom, by which David was driven from the throne, and forced to
   take refuge under circumstances of great distress in the wilderness.
   But it seems rather to have been written at a period when he was
   reduced to extreme danger by the persecutions of Saul. It is a prayer,
   expressive of the deepest distress, and full of fervor, urging every
   consideration which could be supposed to solicit the compassion of God.
   After having disburdened his sorrows and given utterance to his
   requests, the Psalmist contemplates the prospect of deliverance, and
   offers thanksgivings to God as if he had already obtained it.

   Psalm 55:1-3

   1. Give ear to my prayer, O God! and hide not thyself from my
   supplication. 2. Attend unto me, and answer me. I will wail [293] in my
   address, [294] and make a noise. [295] 3. By reason of the voice of the
   enemy, under the affliction of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon
   me, and in wrath they fight against me.


   1. Give ear to my prayer, O God! From the language with which the psalm
   opens, we may conclude that David at this time was laboring under heavy
   distress. It could be no ordinary amount of it which produced such an
   overwhelming effect upon a saint of his distinguished courage. The
   translation which has been given of 'ryd, arid, I will prevail, does
   violence to the context, for, so far from boasting of the fortitude
   which would govern his address, he is anxious to convey an impression
   of his wretchedness, by intimating that he was constrained to cry out
   aloud. What is added in the third verse, By reason of the voice of the
   enemy, may be viewed as connected either with the first verse or that
   immediately preceding, or with both. By the voice some understand such
   a noise as is occasioned by a multitude of men; as if he had said, that
   the enemy was mustering many troops against him: but he rather alludes
   to the threatenings which we may suppose that Saul was in the habit of
   venting upon this innocent prophet. The interpretation, too, which has
   been given of the casting of iniquity upon him, as if it meant that his
   enemies loaded him with false accusations, is strained, and scarcely
   consistent with the context. The words are designed to correspond with
   the succeeding clause, where it is said that his enemies fought against
   him in wrath; and, therefore, to cast iniquity upon him means, in my
   opinion, no more than to discharge their unjust violence upon him for
   his destruction, or iniquitously to plot his ruin. If any distinction
   be intended between the two clauses, perhaps the fighting against him
   in wrath may refer to their open violence, and the casting of iniquity
   upon him [296] to their deceitful treachery. In this case, 'vn, aven,
   which I have rendered iniquity, will signify hidden malice. The
   affliction of the wicked is here to be understood in the active sense
   of persecution. And in applying the term wicked to his enemies, he does
   not so much level an accusation against them as implicitly assert his
   own innocence. Our greatest comfort under persecution is conscious
   rectitude, the reflection that we have not deserved it; for there
   springs from this the hope that we will experience the help of the
   Lord, who is the shield and defense of the distressed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [293] The verb 'ryd, arid, which Calvin renders, "I will wail," is
   rendered by Boothroyd, "I am distressed, confused, distracted." Mudge
   is of opinion that 'ryd, arid, is derived from yrd, yarad, to tincture,
   to drop, etc.; and hence he reads, "While I weep in my complaint."

   [294] "Meditation or discoursing, talk, prayer, complaint. The Hebrew
   siach signifieth any large discourse or exercise of the mind or mouth,
   by busy musing, talking, praying, communing with one's self or others."
   -- Ainsworth.

   [295] "Heb am in a violent tumultuous agitation, as the waves of the
   sea." -- Bishop Horne The original word hvm, hum, according to
   Gesenius, signifies "to put in motion, throw into commotion,
   consternation, to agitate; and Hiph to make commotion, to make a noise,
   spoken of an unquiet mind, internal commotion, Psalm 55:3."

   [296] "Literally slide iniquity upon me; i.e., by oblique and artful
   insinuations they asperse my character. The sentiment of the whole line
   I take to be this, that the enemies of the Psalmist, by sly
   insinuations, brought him under the suspicion of the worst enemies, and
   then wreaked their malice upon him under the color of a just
   resentment." -- Horsley.

   Psalm 55:4-8

   4. My heart trembles within me, and the terrors of death have fallen
   upon me. 5. Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath
   overwhelmed me. 6. And I said, Who will give me wings like a dove? I
   will fly away, and be at rest. 7. Lo! I will prolong the flight, [297]
   I will repose in the wilderness. Selah. 8. I will hasten a deliverance
   for me, [298] from the wind raised by the whirlwind.


   4. My heart trembles within me [299] Here we have additional evidence
   of the extremity of David's sufferings. He that uses these words was no
   soft or effeminate person, but one who had given indubitable proofs of
   constancy. Nor is it merely of the atrocious injuries inflicted upon
   him by his enemies that he complains. He exclaims that he is
   overwhelmed with terrors, and thus acknowledges that his heart was not
   insensible to his afflictions. We may learn from the passage,
   therefore, not only that the sufferings which David endured at this
   time were heavy, but that the fortitude of the greatest servants of God
   fails them in the hour of severe trial. We are all good soldiers so
   long as things go well with us, but when brought to close combat, our
   weakness is soon apparent. Satan avails himself of the advantage,
   suggests that God has withdrawn the supports of his Spirit, and
   instigates us to despair. Of this we have an example in David, who is
   here represented as struggling with inward fears, as well as a
   complication of outward calamities, and sustaining a sore conflict of
   spirit in his application to the throne of God. The expression, terrors
   of death, shows that he was on the very eve of sinking unless Divine
   grace interposed.

   6 And I said, Who will give me wings like a dove? [300] These words
   mean more than merely that he could find no mode of escape. They are
   meant to express the deplorableness of his situation, which made exile
   a blessing to be coveted, and this not the common exile of mankind, but
   such as that of the dove when it flies far off to some deserted
   hiding-place. They imply that he could only escape by a miracle. They
   intimate that even the privilege of retreat by common banishment was
   denied him, so that it fared worse with him than with the poor bird of
   heaven, which can at least fly from its pursuer. Some think that the
   dove is singled out on account of its swiftness. The Jews held the
   ridiculous idea that the Hebrew reads wing in the singular number,
   because doves use but one wing in flying; whereas nothing is more
   common in Scripture than such a change of number. It seems most
   probable that David meant by this comparison, that he longed to escape
   from his cruel enemies, as the timid and defenseless dove flies from
   the hawk. Great, indeed, must have been the straits to which he was
   reduced, when he could so far forget the promise made to him of the
   kingdom as, in the agitation of his spirits, to contemplate a
   disgraceful flight, and speak of being content to hide himself far from
   his native country, and the haunts of human society, in some solitude
   of the wilderness. Nay, he adds, as if by way of concession to the fury
   of his adversaries, that he was willing (would they grant it) to wander
   far off, that he was not proposing terms of truce to them which he
   never meant to fulfill, merely to gain time, as those will do who
   entertain some secret and distant hope of deliverance. We may surely
   say that these are the words of a man driven to the borders of
   desperation. Such was the extremity in which he stood, that though
   prepared to abandon all, he could not obtain life even upon that
   condition. In such circumstances, in the anguish of this anxiety, we
   must not wonder that his heart was overwhelmed with the sorrows of
   death. The Hebrew word svh, soah, which I have rendered raised, is by
   some translated tempestuous; and there can be no doubt that the
   Psalmist means a stormy wind raised by a whirlwind. When he says that
   this wind is raised by the whirlwind, [301] by this circumlocution he
   means a violent wind, such as compels the traveler to fly and seek
   shelter in the nearest dwelling or covert.

   [299] "My heart is in travail within me." chvl, "de tremore maxime
   parturientium." -- Fry Ainsworth reads, "My heart is pained within me,
   or trembleth with pain." "The word," says he, "usually meaneth such
   pains as a woman feeleth in her travail."

   [300] This very beautiful image, derived from the flight of the dove,
   is continued in the two following verses. The defenselessness of the
   dove, the danger to which it is exposed from birds of prey, the
   surprising rapidity with which, when pursued by the hawk, it flees to
   deserts and rocks to hide itself, putting forth its utmost speed, and
   outstripping its deadly pursuer; all these characteristics of this bird
   were in the view of the Psalmist on the present occasion. We find an
   allusion to them in Jeremiah 48:28: "O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the
   cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove that maketh her
   nest in the sides of the hole's mouth." The poets of Greece and Rome
   make frequent allusions to the rapid flight of the dove: -- "So, when
   the falcon wings her way above,
   To the cleft cavern speeds the gentle dove,
   Not fated yet to die." -- Pope's Homer. Sophocles, in a passage
   somewhat similar to this of the Psalmist, says, "O that with the rapid
   whirlwind flight of a dove I could cleave the etherial clouds!" --
   (OEdip Colon 1136.) "Kimshi gives it as the reason why the Psalmist
   prefers the dove to other birds, that while they become weary with
   flying, and alight upon a rock or a tree to recruit their strength, and
   are taken; the dove, when she is fatigued, alternately rests one wing,
   and flies with the other, and, by this means, escapes from the swiftest
   pursuers." -- (Paxton's Illustrations of Scripture, volume 2, p. 292.)
   It is worthy of observation, and it serves to heighten the effect of
   the Psalmist's comparison, that yvnh, yonah, the Hebrew name of the
   dove, is derived from ynh, yanah, he hath oppressed by force or fraud,
   and seems to have been applied to it from the circumstance of its being
   particularly defenseless, and exposed to rapine and violence. --
   Buxtorf's Lexicon

   [301] Whirlwinds are not uncommon in Palestine, and the surrounding
   countries, and to them we often find allusions in the Sacred Writings.
   The description of that kind of whirlwind called the Sammiel, which
   sometimes happens between Egypt and Nubia, will serve to show the
   propriety with which David made this allusion in his present
   circumstances of distress and danger. "This wind, which the Arabs call
   poisonous, stifles on the spot those that are unfortunate enough to
   breathe in it: so that to guard against its pernicious effects, they
   are obliged to throw themselves speedily on the ground, with their face
   close to these burning sands, with which they are surrounded, and to
   cover their heads with some cloth or carpet, lest, in respiration, they
   should suck in that deadly quality which everywhere attends it. People
   ought even to think themselves very happy when this wind, which is
   always besides very violent, does not raise up large quantities of sand
   with a whirling motion, which, darkening the air, render the guides
   incapable of discerning their way. Sometimes whole caravans have been
   buried by this means under the sand, with which this wind is frequently
   charged." -- Maillet, quoted in Harmer's Observations, volume1, p. 95.

   Psalm 55:9-11

   9. Destroy, O Lord! and divide their tongue: for I have seen
   persecution and strife in the city. 10. Day and night they go about it
   upon the walls thereof labouring also, and sorrow, are in the midst of
   it. 11. Wickedness [302] is in the midst thereof; deceit and guile
   depart not from her streets.


   9. Destroy, [303] O Lord; and divide their tongue Having now composed,
   as it were, his mind, he resumes the exercise of prayer. Had he
   indulged longer in the strain of complaint, he might have given his
   sanction to the folly of those who do themselves more harm than good by
   the excessive use of this barren species of comfort. There will
   occasionally escape from the lips of a saint, when he prays, some
   complaining exclamations which cannot be altogether justified, but he
   soon recalls himself to the exercise of believing supplication. In the
   expression, divide their tongue, there seems an allusion to the
   judgment which fell upon the builders of Babel, (Genesis 31:7.) He
   means in general to pray that God would break their criminal
   confederacies, and distract their impious counsels, but evidently with
   an indirect reference to that memorable proof which God gave of his
   power to thwart the designs of the wicked by confounding their
   communication. It is thus that to this day he weakens the enemies of
   the Church, and splits them into factions, through the force of mutual
   animosities, rivalries, and disagreements in opinion. For his own
   encouragement in prayer, the Psalmist proceeds to insist upon the
   wickedness and malignity of his adversaries, this being a truth never
   to be lost sight of, that just in proportion as men grow rampant in
   sin, may it be anticipated that the divine judgments are about to
   descend upon them. From the unbridled license prevailing amongst them,
   he comforts himself with the reflection that the deliverance of God
   cannot be far distant; for he visits the proud, but gives more grace to
   the humble. Before proceeding to pray for divine judgments against
   them, he would intimate that he had full knowledge of their evil and
   injurious character. Interpreters have spent an unnecessary degree of
   labor in determining whether the city here spoken of was that of
   Jerusalem or of Keilah, for David by this term would appear merely to
   denote the open and public prevalence of crime in the country. The city
   stands opposed to places more hidden and obscure, and he insinuates
   that strife was practiced with unblushing publicity. Granting that the
   city meant was the metropolis of the kingdom, this is no reason why we
   should not suppose that the Psalmist had in his view the general state
   of the country; but the term is, in my opinion, evidently employed in
   an indefinite sense, to intimate that such wickedness as is generally
   committed in secret was at that time openly and publicly perpetrated.
   It is with the same view of marking the aggravated character of the
   wickedness then reigning in the nation, that he describes their crimes
   as going about the walls, keeping sentry or watch, so to speak, upon
   them. Walls are supposed to protect a city from rapine and incursion,
   but he complains that this order of things was inverted -- that the
   city, instead of being surrounded with fortifications, was beset with
   strife and oppression, or that these had possession of the walls, and
   went about them. [304] I have already commented elsewhere upon the
   words 'vn, aven, and ml, amal. In announcing that wickedness was in the
   midst of the city, and deceit and guile in her streets, he points to
   the true source of the prevailing crimes; even as it was to be expected
   that those who were inwardly corrupt, and given to such mischievous
   devices, would indulge in violence, and in persecuting the poor and
   defenseless. In general, he is to be considered as adverting in this
   passage to the deplorable confusions which marked the government of
   Saul, when justice and order were in a manner banished from the realm.
   And whether his description were intended to apply to one city or to
   many, matters had surely reached a portentous crisis in a nation
   professing the true religion, when any of their cities had thus become
   a den of robbers. It may be observed, too, that David, in denouncing a
   curse, as he does in the psalm before us, upon cities of this
   description, was obviously borne out by what must have been the
   judgment of the Holy Spirit against them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [302] "Malice." -- Fr.

   [303] Hare, Green, and others, conjecture that the first verb in the
   verse, "destroy," had been originally "divide" -- "divide, O Lord!
   divide their tongues." In Scripture we sometimes meet with an elegant
   repetition of this kind, as in Psalm 59:13, "Consume them in wrath,
   consume them, that they may not be."

   [304] "Violence and Strife" are here personified, as sentinels or
   patrol, who keep watch over the city; going their rounds upon the walls
   to guard "labor, sorrow, wickedness, deceit, and guile," which reign in
   the midst of it, and to exclude happiness, righteousness, and truth.
   "It is, in fact," says Bishop Mant, "a very fine specimen of that power
   of personification, or enduing general and abstract ideas with personal
   qualities; and thus introducing them acting and speaking upon the
   stage, for which the Hebrew poets are distinguished, equalling therein
   the most polished writers of other nations in elegance and beauty, and
   surpassing the most elevated in grandeur and sublimity."

   Psalm 55:12-15

   12. Of a truth, it was not an enemy that cast reproach upon me, for
   then I could have borne it: [305] it was not an adversary that did
   magnify himself against me, for then I would have hid [306] myself from
   him. 13. But it was thou, a man of mine own order, my leader, and mine
   acquaintance. 14. We sweetly exchanged our most secret thoughts; [307]
   we walked into the house of God in company. 15. Let death seize upon
   them, let them descend alive into the grave for wickedness is in their
   dwelling, and in the midst of them.


   12 Of a truth, it was not an enemy that cast reproach upon me He
   informs us of one circumstance which added bitterness to the injuries
   under which he suffered, that they came from the hands not only of his
   professed enemies, but of such as pretended to be his friends. Those
   mistake the meaning of ns', nasa, who interpret it as if David had
   said, that he could patiently have borne the reproach of an open enemy.
   What he says is, that had an open enemy reproached him, he could then
   have met it, as one meets and parries off a blow which is aimed at him.
   Against a known foe we are on our watch, but the unsuspected stroke of
   a friend takes us by surprise. By adopting this view of the word, we
   shall find that the repetition in the verse is more perfect; reading in
   the one member, I would have met it; and in the other, I would have
   hidden myself When he speaks of the enemy magnifying himself against
   him, he does not simply mean that he used insulting language, but in
   general, that he summoned all his violence to overthrow him. The sum of
   David's complaint in this passage is, that he was assailed by treachery
   of that secret description which rendered self-defense impossible. With
   regard to the individual whom he had particularly in view, when he
   preferred this accusation, I do not imagine that it was Ahitophel, for
   the psalm itself would not appear to have been written upon the
   persecution of Absalom. Whether it may have been some notorious traitor
   in the city of Keilah, it is impossible to determine. Not the least
   probable conjecture is, that it may have been some great man at court,
   whose intimacy with David was generally known. Possibly he may have had
   more than one in his eye, courtiers who had sacrificed former
   friendship to a desire of rising in the royal favor, and lent their
   influence to destroy him. These, with some more eminent person at their
   head, may be the parties aimed at. At any rate, we are taught by the
   experience of David, as here represented to us, that we must expect in
   this world to meet with the secret treachery of friends, as well as
   with undisguised persecution. Satan has assaulted the Church with sword
   and open war, but he has also raised up domestic enemies to injure it
   with the more secret weapons of stratagem and fraud. This is a species
   of foe which, as Bernard expresses it, we can neither fly from nor put
   to flight. Whoever might be the individual referred to, David calls him
   a man of his own order, for so the term rk, erach, should, in my
   opinion, be translated, and not as some, his equal in estimation, or as
   by others, a man esteemed by him to be his second self. [308] He
   complains of the violation of the common bond of fraternity, as none
   needs to be told that there are various bonds, whether of relationship,
   profession, or office, which ought to be respected and held sacred. He
   makes mention also of his having been his leader and commander, of
   their having enjoyed sweet interchange of secret counsel together, and
   of their having frequented the religious assemblies in company, -- all
   of which he adverts to as circumstances which lent an additional
   aggravation to his treachery. The term rgs [309] , regesh, does not
   seem to signify here the stir attending the convention of an assembly,
   but rather company, intimating, that he was his close companion when
   they went to the house of God. Thus he would inform us, that he was
   betrayed by one who had been his intimate associate, and to whom he had
   looked up as a leader, in matters not only secular but religious. We
   are taught by the Spirit to reverence all the natural ties which bind
   us together in society. Besides the common and universal one of
   humanity, there are others of a more sacred kind, by which we should
   feel ourselves attached to men in proportion as they are more nearly
   connected with us than others by neighborhood, relationship, or
   professional calling, the more as we know that such connections are not
   the result of chance, but of providential design and arrangement. Need
   I say that the bond of religious fellowship is the most sacred of all?

   15 Let death seize upon them. He now denounces the whole faction, not
   the nation generally, but those who had taken a prominent part in the
   persecution of him. In imprecating this curse he was not influenced by
   any bad feeling towards them, and must be understood as speaking not in
   his own cause but in that of God, and under the immediate guidance of
   his Spirit. This was no wish uttered in a moment of resentment or of
   reckless and ill-considered zeal, and which would justify us in
   launching maledictions against our enemies upon every trivial
   provocation. The spirit of revenge differs widely from the holy and
   regulated fervor with which David prays for the judgment of God against
   wicked men, who had already been doomed to everlasting destruction. The
   translation, Let death condemn them, is forced, and so also is another
   which has been suggested, Let him appoint death a creditor over them.
   [310] That which we have given is the most obvious and simple. In
   praying that his enemies may descend alive into the grave, it has been
   well observed, that he seems to allude to the punishment of Korah,
   Dathan, and Abiram; though I conceive that in imprecating sudden and
   unexpected ruin upon them, he adverts to the proud persuasion which
   they cherished in their prosperity, that they would escape the stroke
   of death. "Lord," as if he had said, "in the infatuation of their pride
   they consider themselves to be exempted from the ordinary lot of
   mortality, but let the earth swallow them up alive -- let nothing
   prevent their being dragged down with all their pomp to the destruction
   which they deserve." The cause which he assigns for his prayer in the
   latter part of the verse, is another proof that he was not influenced
   by any personal resentment against his enemies, but simply denounced
   the just judgments of God upon such as persecuted the Church.
   Wickedness, he adds, is in their dwelling By this he meant that it
   could not but dwell where they dwelt and this he expresses still more
   fully when he adds, in the midst of them; intimating, that they
   inwardly cherished their wickedness, so that it was their inseparable
   companion, and dwelt with them under the same roof.

   Psalm 55:16-19

   16. I will call upon God, and Jehovah shall save me. 17. Evening, and
   morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud; and he shall hear my
   voice. 18. He hath redeemed my soul into peace from the battle which
   was against me: for they were in great numbers with me. 19. God shall
   hear, and afflict them, [311] even He who sitteth from ancient time.
   [312] Selah. Because they have no changes, and fear not God.


   16 I will call upon God. In translating this verse I have retained the
   future tense of the verb, as the Psalmist does not refer to something
   already done, but rather excites himself to the duty of prayer, and to
   the exercise of hope and confidence. Though there was no apparent
   method of escape, and he stood on the brink of immediate destruction,
   he declares his resolution to continue in prayer, and expresses his
   assurance that it would be successful. In the verse which follows he
   engages more particularly to show perseverance in prayer. He does not
   content himself with saying that he will pray, for many do this in a
   perfunctory manner, and soon become wearied with the exercise; but he
   resolves to display both assiduity and vehemency. From the particular
   mention he makes of evening, morning, and noon, we are left to infer
   that these must have been the stated hours of prayer amongst the godly
   at that period. Sacrifices were offered daily in the temple morning and
   evening, and by this they were taught to engage privately in prayer
   within their own houses. At noon also it was the practice to offer
   additional sacrifices. As we are naturally indisposed for the duty of
   prayer, there is a danger that we may become remiss, and gradually omit
   it altogether, unless we restrict ourselves to a certain rule. In
   appointing particular fixed hours to be observed for his worship, there
   can be no doubt that God had respect to the infirmity of our nature,
   and the same principle should be applied to the secret as to the public
   services of devotion, as appears from the passage now before us, and
   from the example of Daniel, (Daniel 9:3.) Sacrifices are no longer to
   be observed in the Church, but as there remains the same indisposition
   on our part to the duty, and an equal need of incitements to overcome
   it, we should still prescribe certain hours to ourselves to be observed
   in prayer. He adds, that he would cry aloud, to denote vehemency of
   supplication, under the grief and anxiety of mind to which he was
   subjected. He intimates, that no extremity of present trouble would
   prevent him from directing his complaint to God, and cherishing a
   confident hope of deliverance.

   18 He hath redeemed my soul into peace Those who read the two preceding
   verses in the perfect instead of the future tense, are apparently led
   to this by considering that David here proves his former prayers to
   have been answered, from the fact of deliverance having been granted.
   But there is no difficulty involved in adopting the other reading. We
   may suppose that either he was so confident of being delivered that he
   speaks as if he actually were so already, or that he inserts what was
   the substance of his meditations at different times; it being
   sufficiently common, when mention is made of prayers, to subjoin a
   statement of the event which followed from them. Having spoken, then,
   of his prayers, he adverts to the result of them, with the view of
   expressing his thankfulness for the mercy which he had received. He
   says that he had been redeemed into peace -- a strong expression,
   signifying the danger to which he had been exposed, and the almost
   miraculous manner in which he had been delivered from it. What is
   added, they were in great numbers with me, admits of a double meaning.
   Some understand him as referring to enemies; with me being, according
   to them, equivalent to against me. He represents himself as having been
   beset, by a host of adversaries, and commends the goodness manifested
   by God in accomplishing his deliverance. Others think that he refers to
   the angels, whose hosts are encamped round about those that fear the
   Lord, (Psalm 34:7.) The letter v, beth, which I have rendered in, they
   consider to be here, as in many other places, merely expletive; [313]
   so that we may read the words, great numbers were with me. The last of
   these interpretations conveys a comfortable truth, as God, although he
   cannot stand in need of auxiliaries, has seen fit, in accommodation to
   our infirmity, to employ a multitude of them in the accomplishment of
   our salvation. But David would appear rather to speak of enemies, and
   to refer to the number of them, with the view of magnifying the
   deliverance which he had received. [314]

   19 God shall hear, and afflict them As the verb nh, anah, which I have
   rendered afflict, signifies, occasionally, to testify, some understand
   David to say that God would rise up as a witness against them. The
   syntax of the language will scarcely, however, admit of this, as, in
   Hebrew, the letter v, beth, is generally subjoined in such a case.
   There seems no doubt that the word signifies here to addict or punish,
   although this is rather its signification implicitly and by a species
   of irony; for, most commonly, nh, anah, means to answer. Having said
   that God would hear him, he adds that he would answer him, in the way
   of avenging his cause, in the punishment of his enemies. The epithet,
   or descriptive title, which he applies to God, is one calculated to
   comfort the pious mind in times of trouble and confusion. Much of that
   impatience into which we are hurried arises from not elevating our
   thoughts to the eternity of God. Can anything be more unreasonable than
   that poor mortals, who pass away like a shadow, should measure God by
   their feeble apprehensions, which is to cast him down from his eternal
   throne, and subject him to the fluctuations of a changing world? As
   chlph, chalaph, may signify to cut off as well as to change, some have
   supposed that David here complains of the destruction of the wicked
   having been too long deferred; but this is not a probable
   interpretation. The term has been more properly rendered changes But
   even those who have adopted this rendering have varied in the sense of
   the passage. [315] Some understand it to mean that no change to the
   better was to be expected in their character; that they were so bent
   upon evil as to be inflexible to repentance; so entirely under the
   influence of a cruel disposition, as never once to incline to humanity
   or mercy. Others, with more reason, consider that he refers, in the
   language of complaint, to the uninterrupted flow of their prosperity,
   which was such that they seemed exempt from the common vicissitudes of
   life. He represents them as being corrupted by this indulgence, and
   casting off from their minds every principle of fear, as if they were
   privileged with immunity from mortal ills. The copulative particle will
   thus carry the force of a consequence -- they have no changes, and
   therefore they fear not God [316] It is an undeniable truth, that the
   longer the wicked are left in the enjoyment of their pleasures, they
   are only hardened the more in their evil courses; and that where pride
   has the ascendancy in the heart, the effect of the Divine indulgence is
   to make us forget that we are men. In the connection between the two
   parts of the verse there is an implied censure of the infatuation of
   those who are led by their exemption from adversity to conclude that.
   they are a species of demigods; for, how insignificant is the course of
   human life when compared with the eternity of God? We have need to be
   upon our guard when under prosperity, lest we fall into the secure
   spirit which the Psalmist here alludes to, and even carry our
   exultation to the extent of a defiance of the Almighty.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [311] "C'est, leur respondra." -- Fr. marg. "That is, will answer
   them."

   [312] Ainsworth reads, "from antiquity;" Boothroyd, "from eternity."

   [313] Rogers is of this opinion; and observes, that "in the Appendix to
   the first volume of Glassius, many instances are adduced of the
   redundancy of the prefix k; as Exodus 32:22; Psalm 68:5; Ezra 3:3."

   [314] Walford renders the sentence, "Though multitudes be in opposition
   to me." "The sense," says he, "which is here given, is evidently
   required, and is fairly deducible from the Hebrew text." Bishop
   Horsley's rendering is, "For they who stood on my side told for many;"
   -- "they who stood on my side," denoting the Divine assistance
   described under the image of numerous auxiliaries. See 2 Kings 6:16; 1
   John 4:4. Bishop Mant is satisfied that this is the Psalmist's meaning,
   and he accordingly turns the verse thus: -- "And he shall hear me, he
   shall shield,
   And he with peace shall crown;
   My guardian in the battle-field,
   An host himself alone."

   [315] The reason of this difference arises from the ambiguity of the
   meaning of the original word, which signifies change simply, without
   reference to the kind of change. Of the two senses which our Author
   proceeds to state, the first is that adopted by the Chaldee, which
   reads, "Wicked men, who change not their very evil course, and fear not
   the sight of God, shall perish." Dathe, while he admits the ambiguity
   of the word, follows the Chaldee. Gesenius gives the same
   interpretation. "But," says Walford, "this reduces the passage nearly
   to an identical proposition; so that the probable meaning is,
   vicissitudes of fortune. These men had enjoyed great prosperity, and
   been subjected to few trials; they were therefore enamoured of this
   world and its pleasures, and gave themselves little regard about the
   will and authority of God. See Psalm 73:5, 6."

   [316] "That is," says Williams, "they suppose they also shall live for
   ever; or, at least, that things will go on the same for ever. See 2
   Peter 3:4.

   Psalm 55:20-23

   20. He hath sent his hands against those that were at peace with him:
   [317] he hath broken his covenant. 21. The words of his mouth were
   smoother than butter, and his heart war: his words were softer than
   oil, yet were they darts. 22. Cast thy giving [318] upon Jehovah, and
   he shall feed thee: he shall not suffer the righteous always to
   stagger. [319] 23. Thou, O God! shalt cast them into the pit of
   corruption: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their
   days: but I will hope in thee.


   20. He hath sent his hands against those that were at peace with him He
   afterwards speaks in verse 23d in the plural number, but here it is
   probable that he begins by addressing the leader and head of the wicked
   conspiracy. He accuses him of waging war in the midst of peace, and
   being thus guilty of a breach of faith. He had neither suffered
   provocation, nor had he announced in an open manner his intention to
   give battle, but had commenced the attack unexpectedly and with
   treachery. The same charge is insisted upon still further, when it is
   added, that butter and oil were in his lips, while war was in his
   heart, and his words themselves were darts. To appearance they were
   soft and agreeable, but they covered a hidden virulence and cruelty
   which wounded like a sword or like darts, [320] according to the common
   proverb, that deceivers carry on their lips poison besmeared with
   honey. It is well known how many fair promises and flatteries Saul
   addressed to David with a view to entrap him, and we may conjecture
   that the same arts were practiced by his courtiers. It is one special
   trial of the Lord's people, that they are exposed to such attempts on
   the part of crafty men to seduce them into destruction. Here the Holy
   Spirit puts a mark of reprobation upon all subtilty of this kind, and
   particularly upon treacherous flatteries, exhorting us to cultivate
   simplicity of intention.

   22 Cast thy giving upon Jehovah. The Hebrew verb yhv, yahab, signifies
   to give, so that yhv, yehobcha, according to the ordinary rules of
   grammar, should be rendered thy giving, or thy gift. [321] Most
   interpreters read thy burden, but they assign no reason for this
   rendering. The verb yhv, yahab, never denotes to burden, and there is
   no precedent which might justify us in supposing that the noun deduced
   from it can mean a burden. They have evidently felt themselves
   compelled to invent that meaning from the harshness and apparent
   absurdity of the stricter translation, Cast thy gift upon Jehovah. And
   I grant that the sentiment they would express is a pious one, that we
   ought to disburden ourselves before God of all the cares and troubles
   which oppress us. There is no other method of relieving our anxious
   souls, but by reposing ourselves upon the providence of the Lord. At
   the same time, I find no example of such a translation of the word, and
   adhere therefore to the other, which conveys sufficiently important
   instruction, provided we understand the expression gift or giving in a
   passive sense, as meaning all the benefits which we desire God to give
   us. The exhortation is to the effect that we should resign into the
   hands of God the care of those things which may concern our advantage.
   It is not enough that we make application to God for the supply of our
   wants. Our desires and petitions must be offered up with a due reliance
   upon his providence, for how many are there who pray in a clamorous
   spirit, and who, by the inordinate anxiety and restlessness which they
   evince, seem resolved to dictate terms to the Almighty. In opposition
   to this, David recommends it as a due part of modesty in our
   supplications, that we should transfer to God the care of those things
   which we ask, and there can be no question that the only means of
   checking an excessive impatience is an absolute submission to the
   Divine will, as to the blessings which should be bestowed. Some would
   explain the passage: Acknowledge the past goodness of the Lord to have
   been such, that you ought to hope in his kindness for the future. But
   this does not give the genuine meaning of the words. As to whether
   David must be considered as here exhorting himself or others, it is a
   question of little moment, though he seems evidently, in laying down a
   rule for his own conduct, to prescribe one at the same time to all the
   children of God. The words which he subjoins, And he shall feed thee,
   clearly confirm that view of the passage which I have given above.
   Subject as we are in this life to manifold wants, we too often yield
   ourselves up to disquietude and anxiety. But David assures us that God
   will sustain to us the part of a shepherd, assuming the entire care of
   our necessities, and supplying us with all that is really for our
   advantage. He adds, that he will not suffer the righteous to fall, or
   always to stagger If mvt, mot, be understood as meaning a fall, then
   the sense will run: God shall establish the righteous that he shall
   never fall. But the other rendering seems preferable. We see that the
   righteous for a time are left to stagger, and almost to sink under the
   storms by which they are beset. From this distressing state David here
   declares, that they shall be eventually freed, and blessed with a
   peaceful termination of all their harassing dangers and cares.

   23 Thou, O God! shalt cast them into the pit of corruption. He returns
   to speak of his enemies, designing to show the very different end which
   awaits them, from that which may be expected by the righteous. The only
   reflection which comforts the latter, when cast down at the feet of
   their oppressors, is, that they can confidently look for a peaceful
   issue to the dangers which encompass them; while, on the other hand,
   they can discern by faith the certain destruction which impends the
   wicked. The Hebrew word scht, shachath, signifies the grave, and as
   there seems an impropriety in saying that they are cast into the pit of
   the grave, some read in preference the pit of corruption, [322] the
   word being derived from scht, shachath, to corrupt, or destroy. It is a
   matter of little consequence which signification be adopted; one thing
   is obvious, that David means to assert that they would be overtaken not
   only by a temporary, but everlasting destruction. And here he points at
   a distinction between them and the righteous. These may sink into many
   a deep pit of worldly calamity, but they arise again. The ruin which
   awaits their enemies is here declared to be deadly, as God will cast
   them into the grave, that they may rot there. In calling them bloody
   men, [323] he adverts to a reason which confirmed the assertion he had
   made. The vengeance of God is certain to overtake the cruel and the
   deceitful; and this being the character of his adversaries, he infers
   that their punishment would be inevitable. "But does it consist," may
   some ask, "with what passes under our observation, that bloody men live
   not half their days? If the character apply to any, it must with
   peculiar force to tyrants, who consign their fellow-creatures to
   slaughter, for the mere gratification of their licentious passions. To
   such very evidently, and not to common murderers, does the Psalmist
   refer in this place; and yet will not tyrants, who have butchered their
   hundreds of thousands, reach frequently an advanced period of life?"
   They may; but notwithstanding instances of this description, where God
   has postponed the execution of judgment, the assertion of the Psalmist
   is borne out by many considerations. With regard to temporal judgments,
   it is enough that we see them executed upon the wicked, in the
   generality of cases, for a strict or perfect distribution in this
   matter is not to be expected, as I have shown at large upon the
   thirty-seventh psalm. Then the life of the wicked, however long it may
   be protracted, is agitated by so many fears and disquietudes, that it
   scarcely merits the name, and may be said to be death rather than life.
   Nay, that life is worse than death which is spent under the curse of
   God, and under the accusations of a conscience which torments its
   victim more than the most barbarous executioner. Indeed, if we take a
   right estimate of what the course of this life is, none can be said to
   have reached its goal, but such as have lived and died in the Lord, for
   to them, and them alone, death as well as life is gain. When assailed,
   therefore, by the violence or fraud of the wicked, it may comfort us to
   know that their career shall be short, -- that they shall be driven
   away, as by a whirlwind, and their schemes, which seemed to meditate
   the destruction of the whole world, dissipated in a moment. The short
   clause which is subjoined, and which closes the psalm, suggests that
   this judgment of the wicked must be waked for in the exercise of faith
   and patience, for the Psalmist rests in hope for his deliverance. From
   this it appears that the wicked are not cut off so suddenly from the
   earth, as not to afford us hope for the exhibition of patience under
   the severity of long-continued injuries.

   PSALM 56

   In this psalm David mixes complaint with prayer, and assuages the
   distress of his mind by meditation upon the mercy of God. He pray, that
   he may experience the divine help under the persecutions to which he
   was subjected by Saul, and his other enemies; and expresses his
   confidence of success. It is possible, however, that the psalm may have
   been written after the dangers to which he alludes were past, and in
   thanksgiving for a deliverance which he had already received.

   To the chief musician upon the silent dove in distant places, [324]
   Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath.

   The portion of history referred to in the title is recorded in 1 Samuel
   21. Being driven from every hiding-place in which he had hitherto found
   safety, he fled to King Achish. He speaks here of having been
   apprehended; and that he was so, may be gathered from the inspired
   narrative, where Achish is represented as saying, "Lo, ye see the man
   is mad; wherefore, then, have ye brought him to me?" It is probable
   that they suspected him of some sinister design in the visit. He
   escaped upon that occasion by feigning madness; but this psalm proves
   that he must have been engaged in fervent supplication, and that faith
   was secretly in exercise even when he betrayed this weakness. He would
   not appear to have been under that inordinate agitation of mind, which
   instigates men to adopt methods of relief which are positively sinful;
   but in the desperate emergency to which he was reduced, he was
   compelled through fear to employ an artful device, which might save his
   life, although it would lower his dignity in the eyes of the world. If
   he lost the praise of magnanimity, it is at least apparent from this
   psalm, what a strenuous contest there was between faith and fear in his
   heart. The words, upon the silent dove, are supposed by some to have
   formed the commencement of a song well known at the time. Others have
   thought that David is here compared to a dove; and this conjecture is
   borne out by the propriety of the metaphor in his present
   circumstances, [325] especially as it is added, in distant places, for
   he had been driven to an enemy's country by the fury of his
   persecutors. The meaning which some have attached to the word,
   translating it a palace, is farfetched. I have already given my views
   of the term Michtam. [326] I would not pretend to say anything
   dogmatically on a point upon which even Hebrew interpreters are not
   agreed in opinion; but the probability is, that it was a particular
   kind of tune, or a musical instrument.

   Psalm 56:1-4

   1. Be merciful unto me, O God! for man swallows me up [327] he fighting
   against me, daily oppresseth me. 2. Mine enemies daily swallow me up:
   surely they be many [328] that fight against me, O Most High! [329] 3.
   In the day that I was afraid, I did put my trust in thee. 4. In God I
   will praise his word; in God I have put my trust: I will not fear what
   flesh can do unto me.


   1 Be merciful unto me, O God! for man swallows me up [330] It would be
   difficult to determine whether he speaks here of foreign or domestic
   enemies. When brought to King Achish he was as a sheep between two
   bands of wolves, an object of deadly hatred to the Philistines on the
   one hand, and exposed to equal persecutions from his own
   fellow-countrymen. He uses the indefinite term man in this verse,
   though in the next he speaks of having many enemies, the more forcibly
   to express the truth that the whole world was combined against him,
   that he experienced no humanity amongst men, and stood in the last
   necessity of divine help. The term daily would suggest that he refers
   more immediately to Saul and his faction. But in general, he deplores
   the wretchedness of his fate in being beset with adversaries so
   numerous and so barbarous. Some translate s'ph, shaaph, to regard, but
   it is more properly rendered to swallow up, a strong expression,
   denoting the insatiable rage with which they assailed him. I have
   adhered to the common translation of lchm, lacham, though it also
   signifies to eat up, which might consist better with the metaphor
   already used in the preceding part of the verse. It is found, however,
   in the sense to fight against, and I was unwilling to depart from the
   received rendering. I shall only observe in passing, that those who
   read in the second member of the verse, many fighting with me, as if he
   alluded to the assistance of angels, mistake the meaning of the
   passage; for it is evident that he uses the language of complaint
   throughout the verse.

   3. In the day that I was afraid, etc. In the Hebrew, the words run in
   the future tense, but they must be resolved into the praeterite. He
   acknowledges his weakness, in so far as he was sensible of fear, but
   denies having yielded to it. Dangers might distress him, but could not
   induce him to surrender his hope. He makes no pretensions to that lofty
   heroism which contemns danger, and yet while he allows that he felt
   fear, he declares his fixed resolution to persist in a confident
   expectation of the divine favor. The true proof of faith consists in
   this, that when we feel the solicitations of natural fear, we can
   resist them, and prevent them from obtaining an undue ascendancy. Fear
   and hope may seem opposite and incompatible affections, yet it is
   proved by observation, that the latter never comes into full sway
   unless there exists some measure of the former. In a tranquil state of
   the mind, there is no scope for the exercise of hope. At such times it
   lies dormant, and its power is only displayed to advantage when we see
   it elevating the soul under dejection, calming its agitations, or
   soothing its distractions. This was the manner in which it manifested
   itself in David, who feared, and yet trusted, was sensible of the
   greatness of his danger, and yet quieted his mind with the confident
   hope of the divine deliverance.

   4. In God I will praise his word Here he grows more courageous in the
   exercise of hope, as generally happens with the people of God. They
   find it difficult at first to reach this exercise. It is only after a
   severe struggle that they rise to it, but the effort being once made,
   they emerge from their fears into the fullness of confidence, and are
   prepared to grapple with the most formidable enemies. To praise, is
   here synonymous with glorying or boasting. He was now in possession of
   a triumphant confidence, and rejoiced in the certainty of hope. The
   ground of his joy is said to be the divine word; and this implies, that
   however much he might seem to be forsaken and abandoned by God, he
   satisfied himself by reflecting on the truthfulness of his promises. He
   would glory in God notwithstanding, and although there should be no
   outward appearance of help, or it should even be sensibly withdrawn, he
   would rest contented with the simple security of his word. The
   declaration is one that deserves our notice. How prone are we to fret
   and to murmur when it has not pleased God immediately to grant us our
   requests! Our discontent may not be openly expressed, but it is
   inwardly felt, when we are left in this manner to depend upon his naked
   promises. It was no small attainment in David, that he could thus
   proceed to praise the Lord, in the midst of dangers, and with no other
   ground of support but the word of God. The sentiment contained in the
   latter clause of the verse might seem at first glance to merit little
   consideration. What more obvious than that God is able to protect us
   from the hand of men, that his power to defend is immensely greater
   than their power to injure? This may be true, but we all know too well
   how much of that perverse unbelief there is in our hearts, which leads
   us to rate the ability of God below that of the creature. It was no
   small proof, therefore, of the faith of David, that he could despise
   the threatenings of his enemies. And it would be well if all the saints
   of God were impressed with such a sense of his superiority to their
   adversaries as would lead them to show a similar contempt of danger.
   When assailed by these, it should never escape their recollection, that
   the contest is in reality between their enemies and God, and that it
   were blasphemous in this case to doubt the issue. The great object
   which these have in view is to shake our faith in the promised help of
   the Lord; and we are chargeable with limiting his power, unless we
   realize him standing at our right hand, able with one movement of his
   finger, or one breath of his mouth, to dissipate their hosts, and
   confound their infatuated machinations. Shall we place him on a level
   with mortal man, and measure his probable success by the numbers which
   are set against him? "But how," may it be asked, "are we to account for
   this sudden change in the exercise of David? A moment before, he was
   expressing his dread of destruction, and now he bids defiance to the
   collected strength of his enemies." I reply, that there is nothing in
   his words which insinuate that he was absolutely raised above the
   influence of fear, and every sense of the dangers by which he was
   encompassed. They imply no more than that he triumphed over his
   apprehensions, through that confident hope of salvation with which he
   was armed. Men he terms in this verse flesh, to impress the more upon
   his mind the madness of their folly in attempting a contest so
   infinitely above their strength.

   [329] The original word mrvm, marom, here rendered "O Most High!" is
   literally loftily Dathe, Berlin, and Gesenius, render it superbly,
   proudly Cresswell, following Le Clerc, reads, from the highest places,
   and considers the meaning to be, that the foes of David made an
   incursion upon him, descending from the mountains, and forcing him
   again to supplicate Achish. Compare 1 Samuel 27:1, 2, 3. Horsley and Dr
   Adam Clarke read, "from on high;" by which the latter critic
   understands from "the place of authority, the court and cabinet of
   Saul." He observes, on the word mrvm, marom, "I do not think that this
   word expresses any attribute of God, or, indeed, is at all addressed to
   him." "In Micah 6:6, however," says Dr Morrison, "mrvm seems to express
   the perfections of the divine character." Calvin's translation agrees
   with that of the Chaldee, of Aquila, and of our English Bible.

   [330] The verb here translated swallows me up, is rendered by French
   and Skinner, panteth after me. It is literally draweth in the air. It
   thus implies the intense desire of David's enemies to get him into
   their hands, and to destroy him.

   Psalm 56:5-8

   5. Every day my words vex me; all their thoughts are against me for
   evil. 6. They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they
   watch my heels, because they seek my soul. [331] 7. After their
   mischief they think to escape: in thine anger cast down the peoples, O
   God! 8. Thou hast taken account of my wandering; put thou my tears into
   thy bottle: are they not in thy register?


   5 Every day my words vex me The first part of this verse has been
   variously rendered. Some understand my words to be the nominative in
   the sentence, and with these I agree in opinion. Others suppose a
   reference to the enemies of David, and translate, they calumniate my
   words, or, they cause me grief on account of my words. Again, ytsvv,
   yeatsebu, has been taken in the neuter sense, and translated, my words
   are troublesome. But tsv [332] , atsab, commonly signifies to afflict
   with grief, and in Pihel is always taken transitively; nor does there
   seem any reason in this place to depart from the general rule of the
   language. And the passage flows more naturally when rendered, my words
   affect me with grief, or vex me, than by supposing that he refers to
   his enemies. According to this translation, the verse contains a double
   complaint, that, on the one hand, he was himself unsuccessful in
   everything which he attempted, his plans having still issued in
   vexatious failure; while, on the other hand, his enemies were devising
   every means for his destruction. It may appear at first sight rather
   inconsistent to suppose that he should immediately before have
   disclaimed being under the influence of fear, and now acknowledge that
   he was not only distressed, but in some measure the author of his own
   discomfort. I have already observed, however, that he is not to be
   considered as having been absolutely divested of anxiety and fear,
   although enabled to look down with contempt upon his enemies from the
   eminence of faith. Here he speaks of the circumstances which tried him,
   which his faith certainly overcame, but at the same time could not
   altogether remove out of the way. He confesses his own lack of wisdom
   and foresight, shown in the abortive issue of every plan which he
   devised. It aggravated the evil, that his enemies were employing their
   united counsels to plot his ruin. He adds, that they gathered
   themselves together; and this made his case the more calamitous,
   matched as he was, a single individual, against this numerous host. In
   mentioning that they hide themselves, he adverts to the subtile devices
   which they framed for surprising him into destruction. The verb
   ytsphynv, yitsponu, by grammatical rule ought to have the letter v,
   vau, in the middle; from which the general opinion is, that the y yod,
   is as it were the mark of Hiphil, denoting that the enemies of David
   came to the determination of employing an ambush, with the view of
   surrounding him. He tells us that they pressed upon him in every
   direction, and as it were trod upon his heels, so that he had no
   respite. And he points at their implacable hatred as the cause of their
   eager pursuit of him; for nothing, he informs us, would satisfy them
   but his death.

   7. After their mischief they think to escape. The beginning of this
   verse is read by some interrogatively, Shall they escape in their
   iniquity? [333] But there is no necessity for having recourse to this
   distant meaning. It is much better to understand the words in the sense
   which they naturally suggest when first read, That the wicked think to
   escape in their iniquity, but that God will cast them down. He alludes
   to the fact that the ungodly, when allowed to proceed without
   interruption in their evil courses, indulge the idea that they have a
   license to perpetrate the worst wickedness with impunity. In these our
   own times, we see many such profane characters, who display an
   unmeasured audacity under the assurance that God's hand can never reach
   them. They not only look to go unpunished, but found their hopes of
   success upon their evil deeds, and encourage themselves to farther
   wickedness, by cherishing the opinion that they will contrive a way of
   escape from every adversity. David has no sooner stated this vain
   confident persuasion of the wicked, than he refutes it by an appeal to
   the judgment of God, declaring his conviction that, however proudly
   they might exalt themselves, the hour of vengeance would come when God
   would cast down the peoples He makes use of the plural number, to
   fortify his mind against fear, when he reflected upon the array of his
   enemies. Let us remember, when our enemies are many, that it is one of
   the prerogatives of God to cast down the people, and not one nation of
   foes merely, but the world.

   8. Thou hast taken account of my wanderings The words run in the form
   of an abrupt prayer. Having begun by requesting God to consider his
   tears, suddenly, as if he had obtained what he asked, he declares that
   they were written in God's book. It is possible, indeed, to understand
   the interrogation as a prayer; but he would seem rather to insinuate by
   this form of expression, that he stood in no need of multiplying words,
   and that God had already anticipated his desire. It is necessary,
   however, to consider the words of the verse more particularly. He
   speaks of his wandering as having been noted by God, and this that he
   may call attention to one remarkable feature of his history, his having
   been forced to roam a solitary exile for so long a period. The
   reference is not to any one wandering; the singular number is used for
   the plural, or rather, he is to be understood as declaring emphatically
   that his whole life was only one continued wandering. This he urges as
   an argument to commiseration, spent as his years had been in the
   anxieties and dangers of such a perplexing pilgrimage. Accordingly, he
   prays that God might put his tears into his bottle [334] It was usual
   to preserve the wine and oil in bottles: so that the words amount to a
   request that God would not suffer his tears to fall to the ground, but
   keep them with care as a precious deposit. The prayers of David, as
   appears from the passage before us, proceeded upon faith in the
   providence of God, who watches our every step, and by whom (to use an
   expression of Christ)

   "the very hairs of our head are numbered,"
   (Matthew 10:30.)

   Unless persuaded in our mind that God takes special notice of each
   affliction which we endure, it is impossible we can ever attain such
   confidence as to pray that God would put our tears into his bottle,
   with a view to regarding them, and being induced by them to interpose
   in our behalf. He immediately adds, that he had obtained what he asked:
   for, as already observed, I prefer understanding the latter clause
   affirmatively. He animates his hope by the consideration that all his
   tears were written in the book of God, and would therefore be certainly
   remembered. And we may surely believe, that if God bestows such honor
   upon the tears of his saints, he must number every drop of their blood
   which is shed. Tyrants may burn their flesh and their bones, but the
   blood remains to cry aloud for vengeance; and intervening ages can
   never erase what has been written in the register of God's remembrance.

   [331] "Ou, ne demandent qu'a m'oster la vie." -- Fr. marg. "Or, they
   want only to take away my life."

   [332] Horsley observes, that the primary meaning of the verb tsv,
   atsab, is "perhaps to do a thing with great labor, to take pains about
   it; if, indeed, its primary meaning be not to distort Hence it may
   signify to affect the mind with any unpleasing passion or sensation,
   grief, vexation, anger; for every perturbation is a sort of distortion
   of the mind. rvry ytsvv ly -- torquent contra me verba mea,' --
   torquent, i e., labouriose fingunt in mentem alienam et sensum
   alienum.' -- Pagninus after Aben Ezra and R.D." -- Horsley Hammond,
   after stating that zv, atsab, signifies primarily to grieve, or be in
   pain, and that by metonomy it is used for the laborious framing or
   forming of any thing, says, "Here, being applied to another's words or
   speeches, it seems to denote the depraving them, laboring and using
   great art and diligence to put them into such a form as may be most for
   the disadvantage of the speaker, turning and winding them to his hurt,
   in putting some odious gloss upon them, and so, according to sense, may
   most fully be rendered depraving."

   [333] French and Skinner read, "Shall they escape after their
   wickedness?" and observe, that the Hebrew is, "Is there escape for
   them?" the meaning being, that they assuredly will not escape, because
   of their wickedness.

   [334] Some think that there is here an allusion to an ancient custom of
   putting the tears of mourners into lachrymal urns or bottles. In the
   Roman tombs there are found small vials, or bottles of glass or
   pottery, usually called ampulloe, or urnoe lachrymales, which, it has
   been supposed, contained tears shed by the surviving relatives and
   friends, and were deposited in the sepulchres of the deceased as
   memorials of affection and sorrow. If in this passage there is a
   reference to this custom, it must have existed at an early period among
   the Hebrews. It may however be doubted, whether there is any such
   allusion. "It is only a modern conjecture that these bottles found in
   the Roman tombs' have been deposited there for such a purpose, and
   there is no trace of such a custom in ancient writings or sculptures.
   Some think they were intended to contain the perfumes used in
   sprinkling the funeral pile. On some of them there is the
   representation of one or two eyes, and this seems to favor the former
   view." -- Illustrated Commentary on the Bible Let it also be observed,
   that the word n'd, nod, here translated bottle, means a sort of bottle
   which had no resemblance to these Roman urns. It was made of a goat's
   or kid's skin, and was used by the Hebrews for keeping their wine,
   their milk, and their oil. Compare 1 Samuel 16:20; Joshua 9:13; Judges
   4:19; Matthew 9:17. "Besides," as Bishop Mant remarks, "the treasuring
   up of the Psalmist's tears shed by him during his own sufferings, seems
   a very different thing from the offering up of the tears of surviving
   relations or friends, as memorials on the tomb of a deceased person."
   The expression, "Put thou my tears into thy bottle," may be viewed as
   simply meaning, Let not my tears fall unnoticed; let my distress and
   the tears which it has wrung from me be ever before thee, excite thy
   compassion, and plead with thee to grant me relief. As the choicest
   things, such as wine and milk, were put into bottles, the Psalmist may
   also be understood as praying that his tears might not only be noted by
   God, but prized by him. The m'd, nod, was of large capacity, and used
   for churning as well as for wine. It may therefore contain a reference
   to the large quantity of tears which David's affliction forced from
   him. -- Harmer's Observations, volume 2, pp. 121, 122.

   Psalm 56:9-11

   9. When I cry, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know, for God
   is with me. 10. In God will I praise his word; in Jehovah will I praise
   his word. 11. In God have! hoped: I will not be afraid what man can do
   unto me.


   9. When I cry, then shall mine enemies turn back. Here he boasts of
   victory with even more confidence than formerly, specifying, as it
   were, the very moment of time when his enemies were to be turned back.
   He had no sensible evidence of their approaching destruction but from
   the firm reliance which he exercised upon the promise, he was able to
   anticipate the coming period, and resolved to wait for it with
   patience. Though God might make no haste to interpose, and might not
   scatter his enemies at the very instant when he prayed, he was
   confident that his prayers would not be disappointed: and his ground
   for believing this was just a conviction of the truth, that God never
   frustrates the prayers of his own children. With this conviction
   thoroughly fixed in his mind, he could moderate his anxieties, and
   calmly await the issue. It is instructive to notice, that David, when
   he would secure the obtainment of his request, does not pray in a
   hesitating or uncertain spirit, but with a confident assurance of his
   being heard. Having once reached this faith, he sets at defiance the
   devil and all the host of the ungodly.

   10 In God will I praise his word In the original the pronoun is not
   expressed, but we are left to infer, from the parallel verse which went
   before, that it is understood. The repetition adds an emphasis to the
   sentiment, intimating, that though God delayed the sensible
   manifestation of his favor, and might seem to deal hardly in abandoning
   him to the word -- giving him nothing more, he was resolved to glory in
   it with undiminished confidence. When in a spirit such as this we honor
   the word of God, though deprived of any present experience of his
   goodness or his power, we "set to our seal that God is true," (John
   3:33.) The repetition amounts to an expression of his determination
   that, notwithstanding all circumstances which might appear to
   contravene the promise, he would trust in it, and persist in praising
   it both now, henceforth, and for ever. How desirable is it that the
   Lord's people generally would accustom themselves to think in the same
   manner, and find, in the word of God, matter of never-failing praise
   amidst their worst trials! They may meet with many mercies calling for
   the exercise of thanksgiving, but can scarcely have proceeded one step
   in life before they will feel the necessity of reliance upon the naked
   promise. A similar reason may be given for his repetition of the
   sentiment in the 11th verse -- In God have I hoped, etc. We shall find
   men universally agreed in the opinion that God is an all-sufficient
   protector; but observation proves how ready we are to distrust him
   under the slightest temptation. When exposed to the opposition of
   assailants formidable for strength, or policy, or any worldly
   advantages, let us learn with David to set God in opposition to them,
   and we shall speedily be able to view the mightiest of them without
   dismay.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 56:12-13

   12. Thy vows are upon me, O God! I will pay thy praises. 13. For thou
   hast delivered my soul from death: hast thou not delivered my feet from
   falling headlong? that I may walk before God in the light of the
   living.


   12. Thy vows are upon me, O God! I hinted, from the outset, that it is
   probable this psalm was written by David after he had escaped the
   dangers which he describes; and this may account for the thanksgiving
   here appended to it. At the same time, we have evidence that he was
   ever ready to engage in this exercise even when presently suffering
   under his afflictions. He declares that the vows of God were upon him;
   by which he means, that he was bound to pay them, as, among the Romans,
   a person who had obtained what he sought, under engagement of a vow,
   was said to be voti damnatus -- condemned of his vow If we have
   promised thanks, and our prayers have been heard, an obligation is
   contracted. He calls them the vows of God -- thy vows; for the money in
   my hand may be said to be my creditor's, being, as I am, in his debt.
   He views his deliverance as having come from God; and the condition
   having been performed, he acknowledges himself to be burdened with the
   vows which he had contracted. We learn from the second part of the
   verse what was the nature of the vows to which he adverts, and, by
   attending to this, may preserve ourselves from the mistake of imagining
   that he sanctions any such vows as those which are practiced among
   Papists. He says that he would render praises, or sacrifices of praise;
   for the word is applied to sacrifices, which were the outward symbols
   of thanksgiving. David knew well that God attached no value to
   sacrifices considered in themselves, or irrespectively of the design
   and spirit of the person offering them; but we may believe that he
   would not neglect the sacred ceremonies of the Law which was imposed
   upon the Church at that time; and that he speaks of some solemn
   expression of gratitude, such as was customary among the Jews upon the
   reception of a signal Divine favor.

   13. For thou hast delivered my soul from death This confirms the truth
   of the remark which I have already made, that he considered his life as
   received from the hands of God, his destruction having been inevitable
   but for the miraculous preservation which he had experienced. To remove
   all doubt upon that subject, he speaks of having been preserved, not
   simply from the treachery, the malice, or the violence of his enemies,
   but from death itself. And the other form of expression which he
   employs conveys the same meaning, when he adds, that God had kept him
   back with his hand when he was on the eve of rushing headlong into
   destruction. Some translate mdchy, middechi, from falling; but the word
   denotes here a violent impulse. Contemplating the greatness of his
   danger, he considers his escape as nothing less than miraculous. It is
   our duty, when rescued from any peril, to retain in our recollection
   the circumstances of it, and all which rendered it peculiarly
   formidable. During the time that we are exposed to it, we are apt to
   err through an excessive apprehension; but when it is over, we too
   readily forget both our fears and the Divine goodness manifested in our
   deliverance. To walk in the light of the living means nothing else than
   to enjoy the vital light of the sun. The words, before God, which are
   interjected in the verse, point to the difference between the
   righteous, who make God the great aim of their life, and the wicked,
   who wander from the right path and turn their back upon God.

   [325] Harmer is of opinion, that the dove dumb in distant places is

   having given sight to a blind person, which is entitled the Bright
   Star. "The ancient Jewish taste." he remarks, "may reasonably be
   supposed to have been of the same kind. Every one that reflects on the
   circumstances of David at the time to which the 56th psalm refers, and
   considers the Oriental taste, will not wonder to see that psalm
   entitled the Dove dumb in distant places." -- Observations, volume3, p.

   PSALM 57

   This psalm consists of two parts. In the first, David gives expression
   to the anxiety which he felt, imploring Divine assistance against Saul
   and his other enemies. In the second, he proceeds upon the confident
   expectation of deliverance, and stirs up his soul to the exercise of
   praise.

   To the chief musician, Al-tascheth, [335] Michtam of David,
   when he fled from the face of Saul in the cave.

   We are left entirely to conjecture as to the meaning of the word
   Michtam; and equal uncertainty prevails among interpreters regarding
   the reason of the inscription given to the psalm, Al-tascheth, i.e.,
   destroy not. Some are of opinion that this formed the commencement of a
   song well known at the time; others take it to be an expression uttered
   by David in the desperate exigency to which he was reduced, O God!
   destroy me not Others conceive that the word is inscribed upon the
   psalm in praise of the high principle shown by David when he prevented
   Abishai from slaying Saul, and are confirmed in their opinion by the
   fact, that this is the very expression which the inspired historian
   represents him as having used, (1 Samuel 26:9.) But as the prayers
   which follow must have been offered up before he gave any such
   injunction to Abishai, this explanation is not satisfactory; and we are
   left to adopt one or other of the two former suppositions, either that
   the psalm was composed to the air of some song generally known at the
   time, or that the word expresses a brief prayer, which David notes down
   as having been uttered in memorable circumstances, and in circumstances
   of great danger.

   Psalm 57:1-3

   1. Be merciful unto me, O God! be merciful unto me, for my soul
   trusteth in thee; and in the shadow of thy wings will I hope, [336]
   until wickedness [337] pass over. 2. I will cry unto God most High, to
   God that performeth all things for me. 3. He shall send from heaven,
   and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. [338]
   God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.


   1. Be merciful unto me, O God! The repetition of the prayer proves that
   the grief, the anxiety, and the apprehension, with which David was
   filled at this time, must have been of no common description. It is
   noticeable, that his plea for mercy is, his having hoped in God. His
   soul trusted in him; and this is a form of expression the force of
   which is not to be overlooked: for it implies that the trust which he
   exercised proceeded from his very innermost affections, -- that it was
   of no volatile character, but deeply and strongly rooted. He declares
   the same truth in figurative terms, when he adds his persuasion that
   God would cover him with the shadow of his wings. The Hebrew word chsh,
   chasah, which I have translated to hope, signifies occasionally to
   lodge, or obtain shelter, and in this sense it may be understood with
   great propriety in the passage before us, where allusion is made to the
   shadow of wings. David had committed himself, in short, entirely to the
   guardianship of God; and now experienced that blessed consciousness of
   dwelling in a place of safety, which he expresses in the beginning of
   the ninetieth psalm. The divine protection is compared to the shadow of
   wings, because God, as I have elsewhere observed, the more familiarly
   to invite us to himself, is represented as stretching out his wings
   like the hen, or other birds, for the shelter of their young. The
   greater our ingratitude and perversity, in being so slow to comply with
   such an endearing and gentle invitation! He does not merely say, in
   general, that he would hope in God, and rest under the shadow of his
   wings, but, particularly, that he would do so at the time when
   wickedness should pass over him, like a storm or whirlwind. The Hebrew
   word hvh, hovah, which I have rendered wickedness, some translate
   power. Be that as it may, it is evident he declares that God would
   prove his refuge, and the wings of God his shelter, under every tempest
   of affliction which blew over him. There are seasons when we are
   privileged to enjoy the calm sunshine of prosperity; but there is not a
   day of our lives in which we may not suddenly be overtaken by storms of
   affliction, and it is necessary we should be persuaded that God will
   cover us with his wings. To hope he adds prayer. Those, indeed, who
   have placed their trust in God, will always direct their prayers to
   him; and David gives here a practical proof of his hope, by showing
   that he applied to God in his emergencies. In addressing God, he
   applies to him an honorable title, commending him as the God who
   performed whatsoever he had promised, or (as we may understand the
   expression) who carries forward to perfection the work which he has
   begun. [339] The Hebrew word gmr, gomer, here employed, would seem to
   be used in the same sense as in Psalm 138:8, the scope of both passages
   being the same. It materially confirms and sustains our hope to reflect
   that God will never forsake the workmanship of his own hands, -- that
   he will perfect the salvation of his people, and continue his divine
   guidance until he have brought them to the termination of their course.
   Some read, to God, who rewards me; but this fails to bring out the
   force of the expression. It would be more to the purpose, in my
   judgment, to read, God, who fails me; in which case the sentence would,
   of course, require to be understood adversatively: That though God
   failed him, and stretched not out his hand for his deliverance, he
   would still persist in crying to him. The other meaning, which some
   have suggested, I will cry to God, who performs, or exerts to the
   utmost, his severity against me, is evidently forced, and the context
   would lead us to understand the word as referring to the goodness of
   God, the constancy of which in perfecting his work when once begun,
   should ever be present to our remembrance,

   3 He shall send from heaven, and save me. David, as I have repeatedly
   had occasion to observe, interlaces his prayers with holy meditations
   for the comfort of his own soul, in which he contemplates his hopes as
   already realised in the event. In the words before us, he glories in
   the divine help with as much assurance as if he had already seen the
   hand of God interposed in his behalf. When it is said, he shall send
   from heaven, some consider the expression as elliptical, meaning that
   he would send his angels; but it seems rather to be an indefinite form
   of speech, signifying that the deliverance which David expected was one
   not of a common, but a signal and miraculous description. The
   expression denotes the greatness of the interposition which he looked
   for, and heaven is opposed to earthly or natural means of deliverance.
   What follows admits of being rendered in two different ways. We may
   supply the Hebrew preposition m, mem, and read, He shall save me from
   the reproach; or it might be better to understand the words
   appositively, He shall save me, to the reproach of him who swallows me
   up. [340] The latter expression might be rendered, from him who waits
   for me. His enemies gaped upon him in their eagerness to accomplish his
   destruction, and insidiously watched their opportunity; but God would
   deliver him, to their disgrace. He is said to strike his enemies with
   shame and reproach, when he disappoints their expectations. The
   deliverance which David anticipated was signal and miraculous; and he
   adds, that he looked for it entirely from the mercy and truth of God,
   which he represents here as the hands, so to speak, by which his
   assistance is extended to his people.

   [337] The original word, hvvt, ha-uoth, for wickedness, the Septuagint
   here renders sin -- "Until sin pass away." Symmachus explains it in
   Psalm 55:12, by epereia, insulting injury "Simon, from Schultens, has,
   I think, given the true meaning. hvh, barathrum -- est desiderium,
   idque pravum v. c. cupiditas devorandi -- cupiditas dicitur profundum

   "now directed against me by my enemies."

   [339] Horsley reads the last clause of the verse, "Upon God, who will
   bring things to a conclusion for me."

   [340] In this all the ancient versions agree: They make chrph, chereph,
   a verb, and not a noun, regarding it as applicable to God, and
   conveying the idea that He would deliver David, having put to shame, or
   to reproach, his enemies. Thus, in the Septuagint, it is "edoken eis
   oneidos" and in the Vulgate, "dedit in opprobrium," "he gave to
   reproach;" and in like manner in the Chaldee, Syriac, Arabic, and
   Ethiopic versions.

   Psalm 57:4-6

   4. My soul is among lions; [341] and I lie even among them that are set
   on fire, [342] even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows,
   and their tongue a sharp sword. 5. Exalt thyself, O God: above the
   heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth. 6. They have prepared a
   net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before
   me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves.


   4. My soul is among lions. He again insists upon the cruelty of his
   enemies as a plea to prevail with God for his speedier interposition.
   He compares them to lions, speaks of them as inflamed with fury or
   implacable hatred, and likens their teeth to spears and arrows. In what
   he says of their tongue, he alludes to the virulent calumnies which are
   vended by the wicked, and which inflict a deeper wound than any sword
   upon the innocent party who suffers from them. David, as is well known,
   encountered no heavier trial than the false and calumnious charges
   which were levelled against him by his enemies. When we hear of the
   cruel persecution of different kinds which this saint was called upon
   to endure, we should account it no hardship to be involved in the same
   conflict, but be satisfied so long as we may bring our complaints to
   the Lord, who can bridle the false tongue, and put an arrest upon the
   hand of violence.

   To him we find David appealing in the words that follow, Exalt thyself,
   O God! above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth. To
   perceive the appropriateness of this prayer, it is necessary that we
   reflect upon the height of audacity and pride to which the wicked
   proceed, when unrestrained by the providence of God, and upon the
   formidable nature of that conspiracy which was directed against David
   by Saul, and the nation in general, all which demanded a signal
   manifestation of divine power on his behalf. Nor is it a small comfort
   to consider that God, in appearing for the help of his people, at the
   same time advances his own glory. Against it, as well as against them,
   is the opposition of the wicked directed, and he will never suffer his
   glory to be obscured, or his holy name to be polluted with their
   blasphemies. The Psalmist reverts to the language of complaint. He had
   spoken of the cruel persecution to which he was subjected, and now
   bewails the treachery and deceit which were practiced against him. His
   soul he describes as being bowed down, in allusion to the crouching of
   the body when one is under the influence of fear, or to birds when
   terrified by the fowler and his nets, which dare not move a feather,
   but lie flat upon the ground. Some read, He has bowed down my soul But
   the other is the most obvious rendering, and the verb kphph, caphaph,
   is one which is frequently taken with the neuter signification.
   Although the Hebrew word nphs, nephesh, rendered soul, is feminine,
   this is not the only place where we find it with a masculine adjunct.

   [341] "Mudge translates literally, I lie with my soul amidst
   lionesses.'" -- Arch. Secker. This agrees with the opinion of Bochart,
   who thinks that the animals here intended are lionesses, properly when
   giving suck to their young, a time when they are peculiarly fierce and
   dangerous. "Nor need we wonder," he observes, "that the lioness is
   reckoned among the fiercest lions; for the lioness equals, or even
   exceeds, the lion in strength and fierceness;" and this he proves from
   the testimonies of ancient writers.

   [342] Fry reads, "I lay down among children of men, who are flaming
   fire, or breathing flames." Ainsworth reads, "I lie among inflamers;"
   "meaning," says he, "fiery, fierce, and raging persons, that flamed
   with wrath and envy, and inflamed others. Of such David did complain to
   Saul, 1 Samuel. 24:40 [sic]." French and Skinner read, "men of fiery
   spirit; and observe, that the Hebrew is flaming sons of men, i.e.,
   violent men urging on my destruction." Mant observes, that it may
   either be "persons set on fire, that is, with rage and malice; or,
   perhaps, setters on fire, kindlers of mischief, incendiaries."

   Psalm 57:7-11

   7. My heart is prepared, O God! my heart is prepared: I will sing, and
   give praise. 8. Awake up, my tongue: awake, psaltery and harp: I myself
   shall be awaked [343] at dawn of day. 9. I will praise thee, O Lord!
   among the peoples: I will sing unto thee among the nations. 10. For thy
   mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds. 11. Be
   thou exalted, O God! above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the
   earth.


   7. My heart is prepared, O God! [344] Some read fixed, or confirmed,
   and the Hebrew word nkvn, nacon, bears that signification as well as
   the other. If we adopt it, we must understand David as saying that he
   had well and duly meditated upon the praises which he was about to
   offer; that he did not rush into a hurried and perfunctory discharge of
   this service, as too many are apt to do, but addressed himself to it
   with steadfast purpose of heart. I prefer, however, the other
   translation, which bears that he was ready to enter upon the service
   with all cheerfulness and cordiality. And although, wherever this
   spirit is really felt, it will lead to steadfastness of religious
   exercise, it is not without importance that the reader should be
   apprised of the force of the word which is here employed in the Hebrew.
   The ready heart is here opposed by David to the mere lip-service of the
   hypocrite, on the one hand, and to dead or sluggish service, on the
   other. He addressed himself to this voluntary sacrifice with a sincere
   fervor of spirit, casting aside sloth, and whatever might prove a
   hinderance in the duty.

   8. Awake up, my tongue David here expresses, in poetical terms, the
   ardor with which his soul was inspired. He calls upon tongue, psaltery,
   and harp, to prepare for the celebration of the name of God. The word
   kvvd, cabod, which I have translated tongue, some have rendered glory;
   but although this is its more common signification, it bears the other
   in the sixteenth psalm, and in numerous places of Scripture. The
   context proves this to be its signification here, David intimating that
   he would celebrate the praises of God both with the voice and with
   instrumental music. He assigns the first place to the heart, the second
   to declaration with the mouth, the third to such accompaniments as
   stimulate to greater ardor in the service. It matters little whether we
   render the verb 'yrh, airah, I will be awaked, or transitively, I will
   awake myself by dawn of day. [345] But one who is really awaked to the
   exercise of praising God, we are here taught will be unremitting in
   every part of the duty.

   9. I will praise thee, O Lord! among the peoples. As the nations and
   peoples are here said to be auditors of the praise which he offered, we
   must infer that David, in the sufferings spoken of throughout the
   psalm, represented Christ. This it is important to observe, as it
   proves that our own state and character are set before us in this psalm
   as in a glass. That the words have reference to Christ's kingdom, we
   have the authority of Paul for concluding, (Romans 15:9,) and, indeed,
   might sufficiently infer in the exercise of an enlightened judgment
   upon the passage. To proclaim the praises of God to such as are deaf,
   would be an absurdity much greater than singing them to the rocks and
   stones; it is therefore evident that the Gentiles are supposed to be
   brought to the knowledge of God when this declaration of his name is
   addressed to them. He touches briefly upon what he designed as the sum
   of his song of praise, when he adds, that the whole world is full of
   the goodness and truth of God. I have already had occasion to observe,
   that the order in which these divine perfections are generally
   mentioned is worthy of attention. It is of his mere goodness that God
   is induced to promise so readily and so liberally. On the other hand,
   his faithfulness is commended to our notice, to convince us that he is
   as constant in fulfilling his promises as he is ready and willing to
   make them. The Psalmist concludes with a prayer that God would arise,
   and not suffer his glory to be obscured, or the audacity of the wicked
   to become intolerable by conniving longer at their impiety. The words,
   however, may be understood in another sense, as a prayer that God would
   hasten the calling of the Gentiles, of which he had already spoken in
   the language of prediction, and illustrate his power by executing not
   only an occasional judgment in Judea for the deliverance of distressed
   innocence, but his mighty judgments over the whole world for the
   subjection of the nations.

   [343] "Ou, me resueilleray." -- Fr. marg. "Or, I will awake."

   [344] This psalm consists of two parts. The preceding verses, which
   contain the first part, express deep distress and extreme danger, and
   are of a plaintive and imploring strain. But here, where the second
   part commences, there is an elegant transition suddenly made to the
   language of exultation and triumph, which continues to the close of the
   psalm.

   [345] Hammond reads, "I will awaken the morning." Dr Geddes, Archbishop
   Secker, Street, and Fry, give a similar version. "The verb 'yrch," says
   Street, "is in the Hiphil conjugation; and therefore transitive; and
   the word hschr is the objective case after it." As to translating schr,
   early, Archbishop Secker says, "schr is not elsewhere used adverbially,
   nor, I believe, with an ellipsis of k;" and he observes, that "I will
   awaken the morning' is more grammatical and poetical." A similar
   thought frequently occurs in poetry. Thus Ovid says, "Non vigil ales
   ibi cristati cantibus oris evocat auroram." "The cock by crowing calls
   not up the morning there." And in Milton's Allegro we meet with the
   following couplet: -- "Oft listening how the hound and horn
   Cheerly rouse the slumbering morn."

   PSALM 58

   The following psalm consists of two parts. In the commencement, David
   vindicates his personal integrity from the calumnies cast upon him by
   his enemies. Having expressed his sense of the grievous injuries which
   they had inflicted, their cruelty and their treachery, he concludes by
   an appeal to the judgment of God, and by praying that they might be
   visited with deserved destruction.

   To the chief musician, Destroy not, Michtam of David.

   Psalm 58:1-5

   1. Do ye indeed speak righteousness? O congregation! do ye judge
   uprightly? O ye sons of men! 2. Yea, rather in heart ye plot
   wickedness; your hands weigh out violence upon the earth. 3. They are
   estranged, being wicked from the womb: they went astray as soon as they
   were born, speaking lies. 4. Their poison is like the poison of a
   serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear: 5. Which
   will not hearken to the voice of the enchanter, charm he never so
   wisely.


   1. Do ye indeed speak righteousness? In putting this question to his
   enemies, by way of challenge, David displays the boldness of conscious
   rectitude. It argues that the justice of our cause is demonstratively
   evident when we venture to appeal to the opposite party himself; for
   were there any ground to question its justice, it would show an absurd
   degree of confidence to challenge the testimony of an adversary. David
   comes forward with the openness of one who was supported by a sense of
   his integrity, and repels, by a declaration forced from their own lips,
   the base charges with which they blackened his character in the
   estimation of such as were simple enough to believe them. "Ye
   yourselves," as if he had said, "can attest my innocence, and yet
   persecute me with groundless calumnies. Are you not ashamed of such
   gross and gratuitous oppression?" It is necessary, however, to
   determine who they were whom David here accuses. He calls them a
   congregation, and again, sons of men The Hebrew word 'lm, elem, which I
   have rendered congregation, some consider to be an epithet applied to
   righteousness, and translate dumb; [346] but this does not express the
   meaning of the Psalmist. Interpreters differ as to what we should
   understand by the term congregation. Some think that he adverts, by way
   of accusation, to the meetings which his enemies held, as is usual with
   those who entertain wicked designs, for the purpose of concerting their
   plans. I rather incline to the opinion of those who conceive that he
   here gives (although only in courtesy) the usual title of honor to the
   counsellors of Saul, who met professedly to consult for the good of the
   nation, but in reality with no other intention than to accomplish his
   destruction. Others read, in the congregation -- a translation which
   gives the same meaning to the passage we have already assigned to it,
   but is not supported by the natural construction of the words. The
   congregation which David addresses is that assembly which Saul
   convened, ostensibly for lawful objects, but really for the oppression
   of the innocent. The term, sons of men, which he immediately afterwards
   applies to them -- taking back, as it were, the title of courtesy
   formerly given -- would seem to be used in contempt of their character,
   being, as they were, rather a band of public robbers than a convention
   of judges. Some, however, may be of opinion, that in employing this
   expression, David had in his eye the universality of the opposition
   which confronted him -- almost the whole people inclining to this
   wicked factions and that he here issues a magnanimous defiance to the
   multitude of his enemies. Meanwhile, the lesson taught us by the
   passage is apparent. Although the whole world be set against the people
   of God they need not fear, so long as they are supported by a sense of
   their integrity, to challenge kings and their counsellors, and the
   promiscuous mob of the people. Should the whole world refuse to hear
   us, we must learn, by the example of David, to rest satisfied with the
   testimony of a good conscience, and with appealing to the tribunal of
   God. Augustine, who had none but the Greek version in his hands, is led
   by this verse into a subtle disquisition upon the point, that the
   judgment of men is usually correct when called to decide upon general
   principles, but fails egregiously in the application of these
   principles to particular cases, [347] through the blinding and warping
   influences of their evil passions. All this may be plausible, and, in
   its own place, useful, but proceeds upon a complete misapprehension of
   the meaning of the passage.

   2. Yea, rather, in heart ye plot wickedness. In the former verse he
   complained of the gross shamelessness manifested in their conduct. Now
   he charges them both with entertaining wickedness in their thoughts,
   and practising it with their hands. I have accordingly translated the
   Hebrew article 'ph, aph, yea, rather -- it being evident that David
   proceeds, after first repelling the calumnies of his enemies, to the
   further step of challenging them with the sins which they had
   themselves committed. The second clause of the verse may be rendered in
   two different ways, ye weigh violence with your hands, or, your hands
   weigh violence; and as the meaning is the same, it is immaterial which
   the reader may adopt. Some think that he uses the figurative
   expression, to weigh, in allusion to the pretense of equity under which
   he was persecuted, as if he were a disturber of the peace, and
   chargeable with treason and contumacy towards the king. In all
   probability, his enemies glossed over their oppression with plausible
   pretences, such as hypocrites are never slow to discover. But the
   Hebrew word phls, phalas, admits of a wider signification, to frame or
   set in order; and nothing more may be meant than that they put into
   shape the sins which they had first conceived in their thoughts. It is
   added, upon the earth, to denote the unbridled license of their
   wickedness, which was done openly, and not in places where concealment
   might have been practiced.

   3. They are estranged, being wicked from the womb. He adduces, in
   aggravation of their character, the circumstance, that they were not
   sinners of recent date, but persons born to commit sin. We see some
   men, otherwise not so depraved in disposition, who are drawn into evil
   courses through levity of mind, or bad example, or the solicitation of
   appetite, or other occasions of a similar kind; but David accuses his
   enemies of being leavened with wickedness from the womb, alleging that
   their treachery and cruelty were born with them. We all come into the
   world stained with sin, possessed, as Adam's posterity, of a nature
   essentially depraved, and incapable, in ourselves, of aiming at
   anything which is good; but there is a secret restraint upon most men
   which prevents them from proceeding all lengths in iniquity. The stain
   of original sin cleaves to the whole humanity without exception; but
   experience proves that some are characterised by modesty and decency of
   outward deportment; that others are wicked, yet, at the same time,
   within bounds of moderation; while a third class are so depraved in
   disposition as to be intolerable members of society. Now, it is this
   excessive wickedness -- too marked to escape detestation even amidst
   the general corruption of mankind -- which David ascribes to his
   enemies. He stigmatises them as monsters of iniquity.

   4. Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf
   adder [348] He prosecutes his description; and, though he might have
   insisted on the fierceness which characterised their opposition, he
   charges them more particularly, here as elsewhere, with the malicious
   virulence of their disposition. Some read, their fury; [349] but this
   does not suit the figure, by which they are here compared to serpents.
   No objection can be drawn to the translation we have adopted from the
   etymology of the word, which is derived from heat. It is well known,
   that while some poisons kill by cold, others consume the vital parts by
   a burning heat. David then asserts of his enemies, in this passage,
   that they were as full of deadly malice as serpents are full of poison.
   The more emphatically to express their consummate subtlety, he compares
   them to deaf serpents, which shut their ears against the voice of the
   charmer -- not the common kind of serpents, but such as are famed for
   their cunning, and are upon their guard against every artifice of that
   description. But is there such a thing, it may be asked, as
   enchantment? If there were not, it might seem absurd and childish to
   draw a comparison from it, unless we suppose David to speak in mere
   accommodation to mistaken, though generally received opinion. [350] He
   would certainly seem, however, to insinuate that serpents can be
   fascinated by enchantment; and I can see no harm in granting it. The
   Marsi in Italy were believed by the ancients to excel in the art. Had
   there been no enchantments practiced, where was the necessity of their
   being forbidden and condemned under the Law? (Deuteronomy 18:11.) I do
   not mean to say that there is an actual method or art by which
   fascination can be effected. It was doubtless done by a mere sleight of
   Satan, [351] whom God has suffered to practice his delusions upon
   unbelieving and ignorant men, although he prevents him from deceiving
   those who have been enlightened by his word and Spirit. But we may
   avoid all occasion for such curious inquiry, by adopting the view
   already referred to, that David here borrows his comparison from a
   popular and prevailing error, and is to be merely supposed as saying,
   that no kind of serpent was imbued with greater craft than his enemies,
   not even the species (if such there were) which guards itself against
   enchantment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [346] "'lm.There is some difficulty in ascertaining the sense of this
   word. Gesenius derives it from 'lm, to be silent: Is justice indeed
   silent? but this breaks the parallelism, which requires tsdq tdvrvn,
   will ye speak righteousness?' in the first line, to correspond with
   mysrym tsphtv, will ye judge uprightness?' In the second. Dathe agrees
   with Bishop Lowth, etc., who propose to point the word 'lm, or plene,
   'lym, judices, O ye judges, or rulers!' See Exodus 22:27; Psalm 82:1.
   But this reading, though it makes a very good sense, receives no
   support from the MSS., or ancient versions. Diodati and De Rossi agree
   with our translators in taking the word in the sense of assembly,
   congregation So Schindler 'lm, collegatio hominum, congregation,
   multitudo coetus, ab 'lm, ligavit, colligavit. This is probably the
   true sense. LXX. Vulg. Aeth. and Ar., seem to have read 'lm, or 'lm."

   generalibus principiis: sed ubi ad hypothesin ventum est, hallucinari,"
   etc. The French translation runs -- "Dispute yci subtilement que les
   hommes ont un jugement droit et entier es principes generaux, mais
   quand ce vient a la particularite, que leur raison defaut," etc.

   [348] The phtn, phethen, rendered adder, is generally supposed by
   interpreters to be the kind of serpent called by the ancients the
   aspic, and to which there are frequent allusions in Scripture.
   Deuteronomy 32:33; Job 20:14, 16; Isaiah 11:8. It is the vtm, boeten,
   of the Arabians, which M. Forskal (Descript Anim p. 15) describes as
   spotted with black and white, about one foot in length, nearly half an
   inch thick, oviparous, and its bite almost instant death; and which is
   called "the aspic" by the literati of Cyprus, though the common people
   give it the name of kouphe, deaf

   [349] This is the reading of the Septuagint, the Vulgate, and of
   Jerome. Sept. "Thumos." Vulg. and Jeremiah "Furor."

   [350] That the serpent tribe may be charmed is a well-attested fact,
   and one of the most curious and interesting in natural history. It is
   often mentioned by the Greek and Roman classics, by Hebrew and Arabic
   writers; to the last of whom the different species of serpents were
   well known. It is also supported by the testimony of many modern
   travelers. Some serpents are delighted with the sounds of vocal and
   instrumental music, and by it may be disarmed of their fury and
   rendered innoxious, (Ecclesiastes 10:11.) In the East it is not
   uncommon to make use of pipes, flutes, whistles, or small drums, to
   draw them from their hiding-places and to subdue their ferocity; and
   when they are tame ones, the charmer makes them dance and keep time
   with the notes of music, twists them round his body, and handles them
   without any harm, although the fangs are not broken or extracted. But
   in some cases the charmer's art fails; and, notwithstanding his
   incantations, the serpent will fasten on the arm, or some other part of
   the body, and inflict, with its poisoned fangs, a deadly wound,
   (Jeremiah 8:17.) In this case it "will not listen to the voice of the
   charmer." It is not necessary to suppose that the "deaf adder" means a
   species of serpent naturally deaf, and which it is impossible for the
   charmer ever to fascinate. Nothing more may be meant but that his
   incantations sometimes fail of success; that some adders are so
   stubborn that the sound of music makes no impression upon them; and
   they are like creatures who are destitute of hearing, or whose ears are
   stopped. The manner in which the "deaf adder stoppeth its ear" is
   described by Lochart to be this: -- "The reptile lays one ear close to
   the ground, and with its tail covers the other, that it cannot hear the
   sound of the music; or it repels the incantation by hissing violently."
   So impenetrable are the wicked here represented to be to persuasion:
   they will not be wrought upon to forsake their wicked courses, and
   gained to the ways of God, by his most persuasive entreaties.

   [351] The power which charmers had over serpents was probably ascribed
   by them to the agency of invisible beings, although it might be the
   natural effect of the music which they used.

   Psalm 58:6-9

   6. Break their teeth, O God! in their mouth: break the jaws of the
   lions. 7. Let them flow away like waters, let them depart: let them
   bend their bow, and let their arrows be as broken. [352] 8. Let him
   vanish like a snail, which melts away; like the untimely birth of a
   woman, which does not see the sun. 9. Before your pots [353] can feel
   the fire of the thorns, a whirlwind shall carry him away, like flesh
   yet raw.


   6. Break their teeth, O God! in their mouth [354] From this part of the
   psalm he assumes the language of imprecation, and solicits the
   vengeance of God, whose peculiar prerogative it is to repel oppression
   and vindicate injured innocence. It is necessary, however, that we
   attend to the manner in which this is done. He does not claim the
   judgment or patronage of God to his cause, until he had, in the first
   place, asserted his integrity, and stated his complaint against the
   malicious conduct of his enemies; for God can never be expected to
   undertake a cause which is unworthy of defense. In the verse before us,
   he prays that God would crush the wicked, and restrain the violence of
   their rage. By their teeth, he would intimate that they resembled wild
   beasts in their desire to rend and destroy the victims of their
   oppression; and this is brought out more clearly in the latter part of
   the verse, where he likens them to lions The comparison denotes the
   fury with which they were bent upon his destruction.

   In the next verse, and in the several succeeding verses, he prosecutes
   the same purpose, employing a variety of apt similitudes. He prays that
   God would make them flow away like waters, that is, swiftly. The
   expression indicates the greatness of his faith. His enemies were
   before his eyes in all the array of their numbers and resources; he saw
   that their power was deeply rooted and firmly established; the whole
   nation was against him, and seemed to rise up before him like a
   hopeless and formidable barrier of rocky mountains. To pray that this
   solid and prodigious opposition should melt down and disappear,
   evidenced no small degree of courage, and the event could only appear
   credible to one who had learnt to exalt the power of God above all
   intervening obstacles. In the comparison which immediately follows, he
   prays that the attempts of his adversaries might be frustrated, the
   meaning of the words being, that their arrows might fall powerless, as
   if broken, when they bent their bow. Actuated as they were by
   implacable cruelty, he requests that God would confound their
   enterprises, and in this we are again called to admire his unshaken
   courage, which could contemplate the formidable preparations of his
   enemies as completely at the disposal of God, and their whole power as
   lying at his feet. Let his example in this particular point be
   considered. Let us not cease to pray, even after the arrows of our
   enemies have been fitted to the string, and destruction might seem
   inevitable.

   8. Let him vanish like a snail, which melts away The two comparisons in
   this verse are introduced with the same design as the first, expressing
   his desire that his enemies might pass away quietly, and prove as
   things in their own nature the most evanescent. He likens them to
   snails, [355] and it might appear ridiculous in David to use such
   contemptible figures when speaking of men who were formidable for their
   strength and influence, did we not reflect that he considered God as
   able in a moment, without the slightest effort, to crush and annihilate
   the mightiest opposition. Their power might be such as encouraged them,
   in their vain-confidence, to extend their schemes into a far distant
   futurity, but he looked upon it with the eye of faith, and saw it
   doomed in the judgment of God to be of short continuance. He perhaps
   alluded to the suddenness with which the wicked rise into power, and
   designed to dash the pride which they are apt to feel from such an easy
   advance to prosperity, by reminding them that their destruction would
   be equally rapid and sudden. There is the same force in the figure
   employed in the end of the verse where they are compared to an
   abortion. If we consider the length of time to which they contemplate
   in their vain-confidence that their life shall extend, [356] they may
   be said to pass out of this world before they have well begun to live,
   and to be dragged back, as it were, from the very goal of existence.

   9. Before your pots can feel the fire of your thorns. Some obscurity
   attaches to this verse, arising partly from the perplexed construction,
   and partly from the words being susceptible of a double meaning. [357]
   Thus the Hebrew word syrvt, siroth, signifies either a pot or a thorn.
   If we adopt the first signification, we must read, before your pots
   feel the fire which has been kindled by thorns; if the second, before
   your thorns grow to a bush, that is, reach their full height and
   thickness. What, following the former sense, we have translated flesh
   yet raw, must be rendered, provided we adopt the other, tender, or not
   yet grown. But the scope of the Psalmist in the passage is sufficiently
   obvious. He refers to the swiftness of that judgment which God would
   execute upon his enemies, and prays that he would carry them away as by
   a whirlwind, either before they arrived at the full growth of their
   strength, like the thorn sprung to the vigorous plant, or before they
   came to maturity and readiness, like flesh which has been boiled in the
   pot. The latter meaning would seem to be the one of which the passage
   is most easily susceptible, that God, in the whirlwind of his anger,
   would carry away the wicked like flesh not yet boiled, which may be
   said scarcely to have felt the heat of the fire.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [352] There is nothing in the original for, "Let their arrows be;" it
   is a supplement made by Calvin in the French version. There is some
   difficulty in the last member of the verse. Many interpreters refer it
   to God, who bends his bow against the ungodly. This agrees with the
   Septuagint, Vulgate, Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic versions. But
   Symmachus and others refer it to ungodly men, who study, indeed, to
   hurt the godly, but without effect. "This seems," says Dathe, "to be
   the most natural connection: in the 6th verse the sacred writer
   addresses God himself in the second person; and there is here described
   the unsuccessful issue of the endeavors of the wicked against the
   righteous." "I am persuaded," says Rogers, "that some word, the name of
   something with which the wicked, perishing under the Divine vengeance,
   were compared, is lost in the Hebrew." -- Book of Psalms in Hebrew,
   volume2, p. 213.

   [353] "Ou, vos espines." -- Fr. marg. "Or, your thorns."

   [354] "Break their teeth in their mouth" is most probably a
   continuation of the metaphorical illustration taken from serpents and
   adders immediately before, whose poison is contained in a bag at the
   bottom of one of their teeth, and who are disarmed by being deprived of
   this tooth which conveys the poison. This the charmer sometimes does
   after he has brought them out of their retreats by music. When the
   serpent makes its appearance, he seizes it by the throat, draws it
   forth, shows its poisoned fangs, and beats them out. To this beating
   out there seems to be here an allusion. "This mention of teeth," says
   Hammond, "fairly introduces that which follows concerning the lion,
   whose doing mischief with that part is more violent and formidable, and
   so signifies the open, riotous invader, the violent and lawless person;
   as the serpent's teeth, the more secret, indiscernible wounds of the
   whisperer or backbiter, which yet are as dangerous and destructive as
   the former, by the smallest puncture killing him on whom they fasten."

   [355] The original word for snail occurs only in this instance in the
   whole Bible. The LXX. render it hosei keros, as wax, and the Syriac and
   Vulgate follow them. But the Chaldee reads "as a reptile," interpreting
   the word as meaning some creeping thing, which affords an eminent
   example of melting, and this seems to apply to the snail, which, in its
   progress from its shell, leaves a slime in its track till it altogether
   melts away and dies. Comp. Job 3:16

   [356] "Si reputamus quantum temporis inani fiducia devorent," etc.
   Literally, "If we consider how much time they devour in their
   vain-confidence," etc. The French version adheres to this translation
   of the mere words. "Si nous regardons combien ils devorent de temps par
   leur vaine confiance." We have hazarded the more free translation given
   in the text, because this seems one of those instances where the
   brevity of the Latin idiom demands explanation, in order that the idea
   may be intelligible in any other language.

   [357] This verse has been deemed one of the most difficult passages in
   the Psalter, and has greatly perplexed commentators. Bishop Horsley
   reads -- "Before your pots feel the bramble,
   In whirlwind and hurricane he shall sweep them away." He supposes that
   the language is proverbial, and that the Psalmist describes the sudden
   eruption of the divine wrath; sudden and violent as the ascension of
   the dry bramble underneath the housewife's pot. Walford reads --
   "Before your cooking vessels feel the fuel;
   Both the green and the dry a whirlwind shall scatter." The passage is
   supposed by this author and others to contain an allusion to the
   manners of the Arabs, who, when they want to cook their food, collect
   bushes and brambles, both green and withered, with which they kindle a
   fire in the open air. But before their culinary vessels are sensibly
   afflicted with the heat, a whirlwind not unfrequently arises and
   scatters the fuel. And this strikingly expresses the sudden and
   premature destruction of the wicked. Fry gives a somewhat different
   explanation. He reads -- "Sooner than your vessels can feel the blazing
   thorn,
   The hot blast shall consume them, as well the green as the dry." And he
   observes, that "sr, or sr, no doubt expresses the action of the hot
   wind of the desert." This wind is eminently destructive, and has not
   unfrequently been known to entomb and destroy whole caravans. Sidi
   Hamet, describing his journey across the great desert to Tombuctoo with
   a caravan consisting of above one thousand men and four thousand
   camels, relates that, "after travelling upwards of a month they were
   attacked by the Shume, the burning blast of the desert, carrying with
   it clouds of sand. They were obliged to lie for two days with their
   faces on the ground, only lifting them occasionally to shake off the
   sand and obtain breath. Three hundred never rose again, and two hundred
   camels also perished." -- (Murray's Discoveries in Africa, volume 1,
   pp. 515, 516.) Estius gives this sense: "Before your thorns shall
   arrive to their full growth into a bush, the rage of a tempest shall
   snatch them away, as it were, in the flower of their age and growing to
   maturity." The words kmv-chy, kemo-chai, which Calvin renders flesh yet
   raw, are used in this sense in Leviticus 13:16, and 1 Samuel 11:15

   Psalm 58:10-11

   10. The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth [358] the vengeance; he
   shall wash his hands in the blood of the wicked. [359] 11. And a man
   shall say, Verily there is a reward [literally fruit [360] ] for the
   righteous; verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth.


   10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance It might
   appear at first sight that the feeling here attributed to the righteous
   is far from being consistent with the mercy which ought to characterise
   them; but we must remember, as I have often observed elsewhere, that
   the affection which David means to impute to them is one of a pure and
   well-regulated kind; and in this case there is nothing absurd in
   supposing that believers, under the influence and guidance of the Holy
   Ghost, should rejoice in witnessing the execution of divine judgments.
   That cruel satisfaction which too many feel when they see their enemies
   destroyed, is the result of the unholy passions of hatred, anger, or
   impatience, inducing an inordinate desire of revenge. So far as
   corruption is suffered to operate in this manner, there can be no right
   or acceptable exercise. On the other hand, when one is led by a holy
   zeal to sympathise with the justness of that vengeance which God may
   have inflicted, his joy will be as pure in beholding the retribution of
   the wicked, as his desire for their conversion and salvation was strong
   and unfeigned. God is not prevented by his mercy from manifesting, upon
   fit occasions, the severity of the judge, when means have been tried in
   vain to bring the sinner to repentance, nor can such an exercise of
   severity be considered as impugning his clemency; and, in a similar
   way, the righteous would anxiously desire the conversion of their
   enemies, and evince much patience under injury, with a view to reclaim
   them to the way of salvation: but when wilful obstinacy has at last
   brought round the hour of retribution, it is only natural that they
   should rejoice to see it inflicted, as proving the interest which God
   feels in their personal safety. It grieves them when God at any time
   seems to connive at the persecutions of their enemies; and how then can
   they fail to feel satisfaction when he awards deserved punishment to
   the transgressor?

   11. So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward. We have
   additional evidence from what is here said of the cause or source of
   it, that the joy attributed to the saints has no admixture of bad
   feeling. It is noticeable from the way in which this verse runs, that
   David would now seem to ascribe to all, without exception, the
   sentiment which before he imputed exclusively to the righteous. But the
   acknowledgement immediately subjoined is one which could only come from
   the saints who have an eye to observe the divine dispensations; and I
   am, therefore, of opinion that they are specially alluded to in the
   expression, And a man shall say, etc At the same time, this mode of
   speech may imply that many, whose minds had been staggered, would be
   established in the faith. The righteous only are intended, but the
   indefinite form of speaking is adopted to denote their numbers. It is
   well known how many there are whose faith is apt to be shaken by
   apparent inequalities and perplexities in the divine administration,
   but who rally courage, and undergo a complete change of views, when the
   arm of God is bared in the manifestation of his judgments. At such a
   time the acknowledgement expressed in this verse is widely and
   extensively adopted, as Isaiah declares,

   "When thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will
   learn righteousness," (Isaiah 26:9.)

   The Hebrew particle 'k, ach, which we have translated verily,
   occasionally denotes simple affirmation, but is generally intensitive,
   and here implies the contrast between that unbelief which we are
   tempted to feel when God has suspended the exercise of his judgments,
   and the confidence with which we are inspired when he executes them.
   Thus the particles which are repeated in the verse imply that men would
   put away that hesitancy which is apt to steal upon their minds when God
   forbears the infliction of the punishment of sin, and, as it were,
   correct themselves for the error into which they had been seduced.
   Nothing tends more to promote godliness than an intimate and assured
   persuasion that the righteous shall never lose their reward. Hence the
   language of Isaiah, "Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well
   with him; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings," (Isaiah 3:10.)
   When righteousness is not rewarded, we are disposed to cherish
   unbelieving fears, and to imagine that God has retired from the
   government of the world, and is indifferent to its concerns. I shall
   have an opportunity of treating this point more at large upon the
   seventy-third psalm.

   There is subjoined the reason why the righteous cannot fail to reap the
   reward of their piety, because God is the judge of the world; it being
   impossible, on the supposition of the world being ruled by the
   providence of God, that he should not, sooner or later, distinguish
   between the good and the evil. He is said more particularly to judge in
   the earth, because men have sometimes profanely alleged that the
   government of God is confined to heaven, and the affairs of this world
   abandoned to blind chance.

   PSALM 59

   The title, which immediately follows, informs us upon what occasion
   this psalm was written, which bears a considerable resemblance to the
   preceding. He begins by insisting upon the injustice of that cruel
   hostility which his enemies showed to him, and which he had done
   nothing to deserve. His complaint is followed up by prayer to God for
   help; and afterwards, as his hopes revive in the exercise of devout
   meditation, he proceeds to prophesy their calamitous destruction. At
   the close, he engages to preserve a grateful remembrance of his
   deliverance, and to praise the goodness of God.

   To the chief musician, Al-taschith, [destroy not,] Michtam of David,
   when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.

   The incident in David's history, here referred to, is one with which we
   are all familiar, (1 Samuel 19:11.) Besieged in his own house by a
   troop of soldiers, and having no opportunity of egress from the city,
   every avenue to which was taken possession of by Saul's guards, it
   seemed impossible that he could escape with his life. He was indebted
   instrumentally for his deliverance to the ingenuity of his wife, but it
   was from the divine goodness that he looked for safety. Michal may have
   contrived the artifice which deceived the soldiers sent by her father,
   but he never could have been saved except through the wonderful
   preservation of God. We are told in the words of the title that his
   house was watched, and this amounts, in the circumstances, to its being
   said that he was shut up to certain destruction; for the emissaries of
   Saul were sent with orders not only for his apprehension, but his
   death.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 59:1-5

   1. Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God! lift me up from the reach of
   them that rise up against me. 2. Deliver me from the workers of
   iniquity, and save me from bloody men. 3. For, lo! they lie in wait for
   my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression,
   nor for my sin, O Jehovah: 4. They run and prepare themselves without
   my fault: awake to hasten for my help, and behold. 5. And thou, O
   Jehovah, God of Hosts! the God of Israel, awake to visit all the
   nations: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.


   1 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God! He insists upon the strength
   and violence of his enemies, with the view of exciting his mind to
   greater fervor in the duty of prayer. These he describes as rising up
   against him, in which expression he alludes not simply to the audacity
   or fierceness of their assaults, but to the eminent superiority of
   power which they possessed; and yet he asks that he may be lifted up on
   high, as it were, above the reach of this over-swelling inundation. His
   language teaches us that we should believe in the ability of God to
   deliver us even upon occasions of emergency, when our enemies have an
   overwhelming advantage. In the verse which follows, while he expresses
   the extremity to which he was reduced, he adverts at the same time to
   the injustice and cruelty of his persecutors. Immediately afterwards,
   he connects the two grounds of his complaint together: on the one hand,
   his complete helplessness under the danger, and, on the other, the
   undeserved nature of the assaults from which he suffered. I have
   already repeatedly observed, that our confidence in our applications to
   a throne of grace will be proportional to the degree in which we are
   conscious of integrity; for we cannot fail to feel greater liberty in
   pleading a cause which, in such a case, is the cause of God himself. He
   is the vindicator of justice, the patron of the righteous cause
   everywhere, and those who oppress the innocent must necessarily rank
   themselves amongst his enemies. David accordingly founds his first plea
   upon his complete destitution of all earthly means of help, exposed as
   he was to plots on every side, and attacked by a formidable conspiracy.
   His second he rests upon a declaration of innocency. It may be true
   that afflictions are sent by God to his people as a chastisement for
   their sins, but, so far as Saul was concerned, David could justly
   exonerate himself from all blame, and takes this occasion of appealing
   to God on behalf of his integrity, which lay under suspicion from the
   base calumnies of men. They might pretend it, but he declares that they
   could charge him with no crime nor fault. Yet, groundless as their
   hostility was, he tells us that they ran, were unremitting in their
   activity, with no other view than to accomplish the ruin of their
   victim.

   4. Awake to hasten for my help, and behold. In using this language, he
   glances at the eagerness with which his enemies, as he had already
   said, were pressing upon him, and states his desire that God would show
   the same haste in extending help as they did in seeking his
   destruction. With the view of conciliating the divine favor, he once
   more calls upon God to be the witness and judge of his cause, adding,
   and behold The expression is one which savours at once of faith and of
   the infirmity of the flesh. In speaking of God, as if his eyes had been
   hitherto shut to the wrongs which he had suffered, and needed now for
   the first time to be opened for the discovery of them, he expresses
   himself according to the weakness of our human apprehension. On the
   other hand, in calling upon God to behold his cause, he shows his faith
   by virtually acknowledging that nothing was hid from his providential
   cognisance. Though David may use language of this description, suited
   to the infirmity of sense, we must not suppose him to have doubted
   before this time that his afflictions, his innocence, and his wrongs,
   were known to God. Now, however, he lays the whole before God for
   examination and decision.

   He prosecutes the same prayer with still greater vehemency in the verse
   which succeeds. He addresses God under new titles, calling him Jehovah,
   God of Hosts, and the God of Israel, the first of which appellations
   denotes the immensity of his power, and the second the special care
   which he exerts over the Church, and over all his people. The manner in
   which the pronoun is introduced, and Thou, etc., is emphatical,
   denoting that it was as impossible for God to lay aside the office of a
   judge as to deny himself, or divest himself of his being. He calls upon
   him to visit all the nations: for although the cause which he now
   submitted was of no such universal concernment, the wider exercise of
   judgment would necessarily include the lesser; and on the supposition
   of heathens and foreigners being subjected to the judgment of God, it
   followed that a still more certain and heavy doom would be awarded to
   enemies within the pale of the Church, who persecuted the saints under
   the guise of brethren, and overthrew those laws which were of divine
   appointment. The opposition which David encountered might not embrace
   all nations; but if these were judicially visited by God, it was absurd
   to imagine that those within the Church would be the only enemies who
   should escape with impunity. In using these words, it is probable also
   that he may have been struggling with a temptation with which he was
   severely assailed, connected with the number of his enemies, for these
   did not consist merely of three or four abandoned individuals. They
   formed a great multitude; and he rises above them all by reflecting
   that God claims it as his prerogative, not only to reduce a few
   refractory persons to submission, but to punish the wickedness of the
   whole world. If the judgments of God extended to the uttermost parts of
   the earth, there was no reason why he should be afraid of his enemies,
   who, however numerous, formed but a small section of the human race. We
   shall shortly see, however, that the expression admits of being applied
   without impropriety to the Israelites, divided, as they were, into so
   many tribes or peoples. In the words which follow, when he deprecates
   the extension of God's mercy to wicked transgressors, we must
   understand him as referring to the reprobate, whose sin was of a
   desperate character. We must also remember, what has been already
   observed, that in such prayers he was not influenced by mere private
   feelings, and these of a rancorous, distempered, and inordinate
   description. Not only did he know well that those of whom he speaks
   with such severity were already doomed to destruction, but he is here
   pleading the common cause of the Church, and this under the influence
   of the pure and well-regulated zeal of the Spirit. He therefore affords
   no precedent to such as resent private injuries by vending curses on
   those who have inflicted them.

   Psalm 59:6-9

   6. They will return at evening; they will make a noise like a dog, and
   go round about the city [361] 7. Behold, they will prate [362] with
   their mouth; swords are in their lips for who (say they) will hear? 8.
   But thou, O Jehovah! shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the
   nations in derision. 9. I will put in trust his strength with thee;
   [363] for God is my fortress.


   6. They will return at evening. He compares his enemies to famished and
   furious dogs which hunger impels to course with endless circuits in
   every direction, and under this figure accuses their insatiable
   fierceness, shown in the ceaseless activity to which they were
   instigated by the desire of mischief. He says that they return in the
   evening, to intimate, not that they rested at other times, but were
   indefatigable in pursuing their evil courses. If they came no speed
   through the day, yet the night would find them at their work. The
   barking of dogs aptly expressed as a figure the formidable nature of
   their assaults.

   In the verse which follows, he describes their fierceness. The
   expression, prating, or belching out with their mouth, denotes that
   they proclaimed their infamous counsels openly, and without affecting
   concealment. The Hebrew word nv, nabang, means, metaphorically, to
   speak, but properly, it signifies to gush out, [364] and here denotes
   more than simply speaking. He would inform us, that not content with
   plotting the destruction of the innocent secretly amongst themselves,
   they published their intentions abroad, and boasted of them.
   Accordingly, when he adds, that swords were in their lips, he means
   that they breathed out slaughter, and that every word they spoke was a
   sword to slay the oppressed. He assigns as the cause of their rushing
   to such excess of wickedness, that they had no reason to apprehend
   disgrace. It may be sufficiently probable, that David adverts here, as
   in many other places, to the gross stupidity of the wicked, who, in
   order to banish fear from their minds, conceive of God as if he were
   asleep in heaven; but I am of opinion that he rather traces the
   security with which they prosecuted their counsels, and openly
   proclaimed them, to the fact, that they had long ere now been in
   possession of the uncontrolled power of inflicting injury. They had
   succeeded so completely in deceiving the people, and rendering David
   odious by their calumnies, that none had the courage to utter a word in
   his defense. Nay, the more atrociously that any man might choose to
   persecute this victim of distress, from no other motive than to secure
   the good graces of the king, the more did he rise in estimation as a
   true friend to the commonwealth.

   8. But thou, O Jehovah! shalt laugh at them. In the face of all this
   opposition, David only rises to greater confidence. When he says that
   God would laugh at his enemies, he employs a figure which is well
   fitted to enhance the power of God, suggesting that, when the wicked
   have perfected their schemes to the uttermost, God can, without any
   effort, and, as it were, in sport, dissipate them all. No sooner does
   God connive at their proceedings, than their pride and insolence take
   occasion to manifest themselves: for they forget that even when he
   seems to have suspended operation, he needs but nod, and his judgments
   shall be executed. David, accordingly, in contempt of his adversaries,
   tells them that God was under no necessity to make extensive
   preparations, but, at the moment when he saw fit to make retribution,
   would, by a mere play of his power, annihilate them all. He in this
   manner conveys a severe rebuke to that blind infatuation which led them
   to boast so intemperately of their own powers, and to imagine that God
   was slumbering in the heavens. In the close of the verse, mention is
   made of all nations, to intimate that though they might equal the whole
   world in numbers, they would prove a mere mockery with all their
   influence and resources. Or the words may be read -- Even As thou hast
   all the nations in derision. One thing is obvious, that David ridicules
   the vain boasting of his enemies, who thought no undertaking too great
   to be accomplished by their numbers.

   9 I will intrust his strength to thee The obscurity of this passage has
   led to a variety of opinions amongst commentators. The most forced
   interpretation which has been proposed is that which supposes a change
   of person in the relative his, as if David, in speaking of himself,
   employed the third person instead of the first, I will intrust my
   strength to thee The Septuagint, and those who adopt this
   interpretation, have probably been led to it by the insufficient
   reason, that in the last verse of the psalm it is said, I will ascribe
   with praises my strength to thee, or, my strength is with thee, I will
   sing, etc. But on coming to that part of the psalm, we will have
   occasion to see that David there, with propriety, asserts of himself
   what he here in another sense asserts of Saul. There can be no doubt,
   therefore, that the relative is to be here understood of Saul. Some
   consider that the first words of the sentence should be read apart from
   the others -- strength is his -- meaning that Saul had the evident
   superiority in strength, so as at the present to be triumphant. Others
   join the two parts of the sentence, and give this explanation: Although
   thou art for the present moment his strength, in so far as thou dost
   sustain and preserve him on the throne, yet I will continue to hope,
   until thou hast raised me to the kingdom, according to thy promise. But
   those seem to come nearest the meaning of the Psalmist who construe the
   words as one continuous sentence -- I will put in trust his strength
   with thee; meaning that, however intemperately Saul might boast of his
   strength, he would rest satisfied in the assurance that there was a
   secret divine providence restraining his actions. We must learn to view
   all men as subordinated in this manner, and to conceive of their
   strength and their enterprises as depending upon the sovereign will of
   God. In my opinion, the following version is the best -- His strength
   is with thee, [365] I will wait. The words are parallel with those in
   the end of the psalm, where there can be no doubt that the nominative
   case is employed, My strength is with thee; I will sing. So far as the
   sense of the passage is concerned, however, it does not signify which
   of the latter interpretations be followed. It is evident that David is
   here enabled, from the eminence of faith, to despise the violent
   opposition of his enemy, convinced that he could do nothing without the
   divine permission. But by taking the two parts of the sentence
   separately, in the way I have suggested, -- His strength is with thee,
   I will wait, -- the meaning is more distinctly brought out. First,
   David, in vindication of that power by which God governs the whole
   world, declares that his enemy was under a secret divine restraint, and
   so entirely dependent for any strength which he possessed upon God,
   that he could not move a finger without his consent. He then adds, that
   he would wait the event, whatsoever it might be, with composure and
   tranquillity. For the word which we have translated, I will intrust,
   may here be taken as signifying I will keep myself, or quietly wait the
   pleasure of the Lord. In this sense we find the word used in the
   conjugation Niphal, Isaiah 7:4. Here it is put in the conjugation Kal,
   but that is no reason why we may not render it, "I will silently wait
   the issue which God may send." It has been well suggested, that David
   may allude to the guards which had been sent to besiege his house, and
   be considered as opposing to this a watch of a very different
   description, which he himself maintained, as he looked out for the
   divine issue with quietness and composure. [366]

   enemies were engaged all the day they were seeking him in vain in more
   distant places; in the evening they came again into the city, and
   continued their search, while their execrations and curses resembled

   [364] Ainsworth reads, "to utter or well out, as from a fountain; belch
   or babble, as Proverbs 15:2, 28, As a fountain casteth out her waters,
   so she casteth out her malice.'" "Le mot Hebrieu signifie se repandre
   en paroles, etc.;" i.e., "The Hebrew word signifies to break out in
   words, and it here denotes the oft repeated and passionate expressions
   which proceed from the mouth of persons actuated by hatred and rage, as
   in Psalm 94:4. To it the word bark answers very well, which is borrowed
   from dogs, and expresses the noise made by these animals; and this word
   is here the more apposite, that David in the preceding verse compares
   his enemies to dogs which incessantly run about and do nothing but
   bark." -- Martin.

   [365] In the Latin edition, from which we now translate, it reads,
   "Fortitude mea ad re." This is evidently a mistake of the printer for
   "fortitudo ejus," and has misled the former English translators. This
   is the more wonderful, as they thus make the Author adopt the very
   transposition of person which he had immediately before rejected. Of
   course, the French version reads, "Sa forte est a toy: je garderay."

   [366] Hammond translates, "His strength I will ward, or avoid, or
   beware, or take heed of at thee." And the amount of his explanation is:
   Saul having sent a party to guard, that is, to besiege the house in
   which David was, in order to kill him, as is mentioned in the title of
   the psalm, David resolves to guard, or look to, or beware of the
   strength of his persecutor, by fleeing to God as his refuge.

   Psalm 59:10-12

   10. The God of my mercy will prevent me: God shall let me see my desire
   upon mine enemies. 11. Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter
   them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord! our shield. 12. The sin
   of their mouth, the words of their lips; let them be taken in their
   pride: and let them speak of cursing and lying.


   10. The God of my mercy will prevent me In the Hebrew, there is the
   affix of the third person, but we have the point which denotes the
   first. [367] The Septuagint has adopted the third person, and Augustine
   too ingeniously, though with a good design, has repeatedly quoted the
   passage against the Pelagians, in proof that the grace of God is
   antecedent to all human merit. In the same manner, he has again and
   again cited the preceding verse, to refute the arrogancy of those who
   boast of the power of free-will. "I will put in trust my strength with
   thee," he says; "that is, men must subject themselves with all modesty
   and humility to God, as having no strength but that with which he
   supplies them." Now, it may be said with great plausibility, that the
   man puts his strength in trust with God, who declares that he has no
   strength but what comes from him, and who depends entirely upon his
   help. The sentiment inculcated is also, without all doubt, a pious and
   instructive one; but we must be ever on our guard against wresting
   Scripture from its natural meaning. The Hebrew word qdm, kidem, means
   no more than to come forward seasonably; and David simply intimates
   that the divine assistance would be promptly and opportunely extended.
   [368] The scope of the words is, that God will interpose at the very
   moment when it is required, however much he may retard or defer his
   assistance. Were it not that we are hurried on by the excessive
   eagerness of our own wishes, we would sufficiently recognize the
   promptness with which God hastens to our help, but our own precipitance
   makes us imagine that he is dilatory. To confirm his faith, he calls
   him the God of his mercy, having often proved him to be merciful; and
   the experience of the past afforded him good hopes of what he might
   expect in the future. The idea of some, that David uses the word in an
   active sense, and praises his own mercy, is poor and unnatural. Its
   passive use is quite common.

   11 Slay them not, lest my people forget David very properly suggests
   this to his own mind, as a consideration which should produce patience.
   We are apt to think, when God has not annihilated our enemies at once,
   that they have escaped out of his hands altogether; and we look upon it
   as properly no punishment, that they should be gradually and slowly
   destroyed. Such being the extravagant desire which almost all, without
   exception, have, to see their enemies at once exterminated, David
   checks himself, and dwells upon the judgment of God to be seen in the
   lesser calamities which overtake the wicked. It is true, that were not
   our eyes blinded, we would behold a more evident display of divine
   retribution in cases where the destruction of the ungodly is sudden;
   but these are so apt to fade away from our remembrance, that he had
   good reason to express his desire that the spectacle might be one
   constantly renewed, and thus our knowledge of the judgments of God be
   more deeply graven upon our hearts. He arms and fortifies himself
   against impatience under delays in the execution of divine judgment, by
   the consideration that God has an express design in them, as, were the
   wicked exterminated in a moment, the remembrance of the event might
   speedily be effaced. There is an indirect censure conveyed to the
   people of Israel for failing to improve the more striking judgments of
   God. But the sin is one too prevalent in the world even at this day.
   Those judgments which are so evident that none can miss to observe them
   without shutting his eyes, we sinfully allow to pass into oblivion; so
   that we need to be brought daily into that theater where we are
   compelled to perceive the divine hand. This we must never forget when
   we see God subjecting his enemies to a gradual process of destruction,
   instead of launching his thunders instantly upon their head. He prays
   that God would make them to wander, as men under poverty and misery,
   who seek in every direction, but in vain, for a remedy to their
   misfortunes. The idea is still more forcibly described in the word
   which follows, make them descend, or, cast them down. He wished that
   they might be dragged from that position of honor which they had
   hitherto occupied, and thrown to the ground, so as to present, in their
   wretchedness and degradation, a constant illustration of the wrath of
   God. The word vchylk, becheylcha, which we have translated, in thy
   power, some render, with thy army, understanding the people of God. But
   it is more probable that David calls to his assistance the power of God
   for the destruction of his enemies, and this because they deemed
   themselves invincible through those worldly resources in which they
   trusted. As a further argument for obtaining his request, he intimates
   in the close of the verse that he was now pleading the cause of the
   whole Church, for he uses the plural number, O God our shield Having
   been chosen king by divine appointment, the safety of the Church stood
   connected with his person. The assault made upon him by his enemies was
   not an assault upon himself merely as a private individual, but upon
   the whole people, whose common welfare God had consulted in making
   choice of him. And this suggested another reason why he should
   patiently submit to see the judgments of God measured out in the manner
   which might best engage their minds in assiduous meditation.

   12 The sin of their mouth, the words of their lips Some interpreters
   read, for, or, on account of the sin of their mouth, [369] supplying
   the causal particle, that the words may be the better connected with
   the preceding verse. And there can be no doubt that the reason is
   stated here why they deserved to be subjected to constant wanderings
   and disquietude. The words as they stand, however, although abrupt and
   elliptical, well express the meaning which David would convey; as if he
   had said, that no lengthened proof was necessary to convict them of
   sin, which plainly showed itself in the mischievous tendency of their
   discourse. Wickedness, he tells us, proceeded from their mouth., They
   vomited out their pride and cruelty. That this is the sense in which we
   are to understand the words, is confirmed by what immediately follows
   -- Let them be taken in their pride. He here points to the source of
   that insolence which led them with such proud and contumelious
   language, and in such a shameless manner, to oppress the innocent. He
   then specifies the sin of their lips, adding, that they spoke words of
   cursing and falsehood By this he means that their mouth was continually
   filled with horrid imprecations, and that they were wholly addicted to
   deceit and to calumniating. [370] Those have mistaken the meaning of
   David who give a passive signification to the word which I have
   translated to speak, and understand him as saying that the wicked would
   be accounted examples of divine vengeance, the plain and notorious
   marks of which were written upon them.

   [367] "We have chsdv, his mercy, with the points chsdy, my mercy, the
   keri being for the one, and the kethib for the other. And, accordingly,
   of the interpreters, some read the one, some the other, both certainly
   meaning the same thing: the Chaldee, the God of my grace, or goodness,
   or mercy;' but the LXX. O Theos mou to eleos autou,' My God his mercy,'
   and so the Latin." -- Hammond Green translates, "My God shall prevent
   me with his loving-kindness."

   [368] Horsley reads, "God shall give me ready help."

   [369] This is the reading adopted by Jerome, and also by Horsley, who
   remarks, that in Jerome's copies the words, "sin" and "discourse," had
   certainly the preposition k prefixed.

   [370] The Syriac translation of the first part of the verse is, "The
   discourse of their mouth is the sin of their lips." That is, whatever
   their lips speak is sin; so many words, so many sins.

   Psalm 59:13-17

   13. Consume, consume them in wrath, that they may not be, and let them
   know unto the ends of the earth that God ruleth in Jacob. Selah. 14.
   And at evening they will return; they will make a noise like a dog, and
   go round about the city. 15. They will wander up and down to eat; [371]
   if they be not satisfied, [372] they will even lodge all night long.
   16. But I will sing of thy power, I will praise thy mercy in the
   morning; [373] for thou hast been my fortress and refuge in the day of
   my trouble. 17. My strength is with thee, I will sing psalms; for God
   is my defence, the God of my mercy.


   13 Consume, consume them in wrath, that they may not be David may seem
   to contradict himself in praying for the utter destruction of his
   enemies, when immediately before he had expressed his desire that they
   might not be exterminated at once. [374] What else could he mean when
   he asks that God would consume them in wrath, but that he would cut
   them off suddenly, and not by a gradual and slower process of
   punishment? But he evidently refers in what he says here to a different
   point of time, and this removes any apparent inconsistency, for he
   prays that when they had been set up for a sufficient period as an
   example, they might eventually be devoted to destruction. It was
   customary with the victorious Roman generals, first to lead the
   captives which had been kept for the day of triumph through the city,
   and afterwards, upon reaching the capital, to give them over to the
   lictors for execution. Now David prays that when God had, in a similar
   manner, reserved his enemies for an interval sufficient to illustrate
   his triumph, he would upon this consign them to summary punishment. The
   two things are not at all inconsistent; first, that the divine
   judgments should be lengthened out through a considerable period, to
   secure their being remembered better, and that then, upon sufficient
   evidence being given to the world of the certainty with which the
   wicked are subjected in the displeasure of God to the slower process of
   destruction, he should in due time bring them forth to final execution,
   the better to awake, by such a demonstration of his power, the minds of
   those who may be more secure than others, or less affected by
   witnessing moderate inflictions of punishment. He adds, accordingly,
   that they may know, even to the ends of the earth, that God ruleth in
   Jacob Some would insert the copulative particle, reading, that they may
   know that God rules in Jacob, and in all the nations of the world, an
   interpretation which I do not approve, and which does violence to the
   sense. The allusion is to the condign nature of the judgment, which
   would be such that the report of it would reach the remotest regions,
   and strike salutary terror into the minds even of their benighted and
   godless inhabitants. He was more especially anxious that God should be
   recognised as ruling in the Church, it being preposterous that the
   place where his throne was erected should present such an aspect of
   confusion as converted his temple into a den of thieves.

   14 And at evening they shall return It is of no consequence whether we
   read the words in the future tense or in the subjunctive, understanding
   it to be a continuance of the preceding prayer. But it seems more
   probable that David, after having brought his requests to a close,
   anticipates the happy issue which he desired. And he makes an apt
   allusion to what he had already said of their insatiable hunger. The
   words which he had formerly used he repeats, but with a different
   application, ironically declaring that they would be ravenous in
   another sense, and that matters would issue otherwise than they had
   looked for. Above he had complained that they made a noise like dogs,
   adverting to the eagerness and fierceness with which they were bent
   upon mischief; now he derides their malicious efforts, and says, that
   after wearying themselves with their endless pursuit all day, they
   would go disappointed of their purpose. He uses no longer the language
   of complaint, but congratulates himself upon the abortive issue of
   their activity. The Hebrew word which I have translated, if not, in the
   close of the fifteenth verse, is by some considered to be the form of
   an oath. But this is an over-refined interpretation. Others would have
   the negation repeated, reading, if they shall not have been satisfied,
   neither shall they lodge for the night But this also is far-fetched.
   The simple and true meaning suggests itself at once, that, although
   they might not be satisfied, they would be forced to lay themselves
   down, and the misery of their hunger would be aggravated, by the
   circumstance that they had passed the whole day in fruitless
   application, and must lie down for the night empty, wearied, and
   unsatisfied. [375]

   16 But I will sing of thy power By this he does not mean merely that he
   would have occasion to sing at some future period, but prepares himself
   presently for the exercise of thanksgiving; and he proceeds to
   acknowledge that his deliverance would be at once an illustrious effect
   of Divine power, and conferred of mere grace. It may be true, that
   David escaped at this time from the hands of his enemies without stir,
   and with secrecy, through the dexterity of his wife; still, by means of
   this artifice, God disappointed the preparations and forces of Saul,
   and may, therefore, with propriety be said to have exerted his power.
   We may suppose, however, that David takes occasion, from this
   particular instance, to look further back, and embrace, in his view,
   the various Divine interpositions which he had experienced.

   17 My strength is with thee, I will sing psalms He expresses still more
   explicitly the truth, that he owed his safety entirely to God. Formerly
   he had said that the strength of his enemy was with God, and now he
   asserts the same thing of his own. The expression, however, which
   admits of two meanings, he elegantly applies to himself in a different
   sense. [376] God has the strength of the wicked in his hands, to curb
   and to restrain it, and to show that any power of which they boast is
   vain and fallacious. His own people, on the other hand, he supports and
   secures, against the possibility of falling, by supplies of strength
   from himself. In the preceding part of the psalm, David had
   congratulated himself upon his safety, by reflecting that Saul was so
   completely under the secret restraint of God's providence as to be
   unable to move a finger without his permission. Now, weak as he was in
   himself, he maintains that he had strength sufficient in the Lord; and
   accordingly adds, that he had good reason to engage in praise, as James
   the inspired apostle exhorts those who are merry to sing psalms, (James
   5:13.) As to the reading which some have adopted, I will ascribe my
   strength with praises unto thee, the reader cannot fail to see that it
   is forced. It is clear that the two clauses must be taken separately,
   as I have already observed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [371] "The literal translation, to eat, i.e., to devour, may be best."
   -- Archbishop Secker. From the great attention which is paid to
   external purity in the East, and in consequence of dogs being reckoned
   unclean, as they were by the Jews under the law, the inhabitants do not
   admit them into their houses, and even carefully avoid touching them in
   their streets, by which they would consider themselves defiled. But
   though not there domesticated as with us, dogs are to be found in great
   numbers, and crowd the streets. They are not attached to any particular
   person or family, nor accounted the property of any one; and though it
   is not uncommon for some of the inhabitants, from motives of
   superstition, to give money weekly or monthly to butchers and bakers to
   feed them at stated times, and though some even leave legacies at their
   death for the same purpose, yet they must necessarily subsist in a
   great measure on what they can seize or steal; and, being very
   numerous, they are perpetually wandering about in large troops seeking
   for something to devour. -- (Harmer's Observations, volume 1, p. 344.)
   To these circumstances the Psalmist clearly alludes in the 14th and
   15th verses, when he compares the behavior of his enemies to that of
   dogs. He repeats what he had said in the 5th verse; but here he intends
   to convey a different idea. "Let them do what they may;" as if he had
   said, "I am safe under the protection of God."

   [372] "C'est, combien qu'ils ne soyent." -- Fr. marg. "That is, though
   they be not satisfied."

   [373] "In the morning. It should seem this hath a relation to Saul's
   servants watching for him in the morning to kill him, (1 Samuel 19:11;)
   meaning, At that time when those people imagine to have me in their
   hands I shall be in safety, and have cause to praise and bless thee for
   my deliverance." -- Annotations on the Bible by English Divines.

   [374] Williams observes, that the Hebrew rendered consume "literally
   means to finish, bring to an end; namely, the banditti. The Psalmist,
   verse 11, prays, Slay them not;' i.e., take not away their lives as
   individuals, but put an end to the conspiracy."

   [375] Street translates, "If they be not satisfied, they spend the
   night in howling;" and observes, that there seems to be a word lost
   after the original verb lvn, lun, which he renders, they spend the
   night; and he supplies h; by the words, in howling The meaning of the
   verb lvm, lun, is ambiguous. It signifies both to continue all night,
   and to growl, or murmur Either sense will be appropriate in this
   passage. The Chaldee and Syriac understand it in the former sense; and
   the Septuagint in the latter.

   [376] "Sed eleganter ambiguam locutionem diverso sensu ponit." -- Lat.
   In the French version, "Mais c'est une bonne rencontre et qui a grace,
   quand il met deux fois un propos ambigu, mais en divers sens."

   PSALM 60

   David, who was now settled upon the throne, and had gained several
   signal victories, tending to confirm him in the kingdom, in this Psalm
   exalts the goodness of God, that he might at once express his
   gratitude, and by conciliating the favor of such as still stood out
   against his interests, unite the community, which had been rent into
   factions. Having first adverted to the clear indications of the Divine
   favor, which proved that God had chosen him to be king, he more
   particularly calls the attention of the faithful to the oracle itself,
   in order to convince them that they could only comply with the mind of
   God, by yielding their consent and approbation to the anointing which
   he had received from Samuel. Prayers also are offered up throughout the
   psalm, urging God to perfect what he had begun.

   To the chief musician upon Shushan-eduth, Michtam [377] of David, to
   teach; when he strove with the Syrians of Mesopotamia, and with the
   Syrians of Zoba, and when Joab returned, and smote of the Edomites in
   the valley of Salt twelve thousand.

   Of the first part of this title I have spoken in another place, and
   shall not insist upon it further than to repeat, that Shushan-eduth,
   the lily of witness, [378] or of beauty, seem to have been the first
   words of some song which was commonly known at the time. It is added,
   to teach; and this, as some have thought, because the psalm was given
   to the Levites, that they might learn it. But others have very properly
   rejected this idea, as we cannot suppose that a title, which is equally
   applicable to all the psalms, would have been here used as a term of
   distinction. More probably it points at a particular instruction or
   doctrine, which would be taught by the following psalm. We may suppose
   that David, who had gained so many decisive victories, but had not the
   satisfaction, as yet, of seeing the kingdom finally settled under him,
   employs the word to denote that he had a special lesson to enforce,
   which was, the duty of all who had hitherto opposed him to put an end
   to factions, and, after such convincing evidences, acknowledge that he
   was their divinely-appointed king. Let experience, at least, as if he
   had said, prove that the sovereignty which I hold meets with the
   approbation of God, crowned, as it is, in the eyes of all, with so many
   tokens of his favor. The psalm is described as being a kind of
   triumphal song for victories obtained over the Syrians and other allied
   nations. As the Jews reckon Mesopotamia, and other countries, to be
   included in Syria, which they call Aram, they are forced subsequently
   to distinguish it into different parts, as here we find Syria Naharim
   put for Mesopotamia, which some of the Latins have named Interamnis,
   (or, between two rivers,) following the Greek etymology; for
   Mesopotamia in Greek means between two rivers, that is, between the
   Tigris and Euphrates. [379] Next, we have Syria Soba mentioned, which
   some have considered upon good grounds to be Sophene, because adjacent
   to the bank of the Euphrates; and David is said (2 Samuel 8:3) to have
   smitten Rehob, king of Soba, as he went to recover his border at the
   river. In the same passage, we read of a third Syria, that of Damascus,
   nearer to Judea, and almost touching upon it. Syria is, in other places
   of Scripture, represented as still more extensive, and has epithets
   attached to it according to the different territories which are meant
   to be pointed out. As David had war with the more adjacent part of
   Syria, and routed the army which had come out from it to the assistance
   of the Ammonites, it may be asked why he speaks only of the inhabitants
   of Mesopotamia and Soba. I think it probable that he specifies the more
   distant nations, as being the most formidable, and as affording a more
   illustrious proof of the Divine favor which accompanied his arms. For
   this reason, he passes over the more neighboring nations, and mentions
   those which were situated at a distance, the terror of which was known
   only by report, and whose overthrow was something unheard of, and
   almost incredible. In the inspired history, two-and-twenty thousand are
   said to have been slain, [380] (1 Chronicles 18:12,) in the title of
   this psalm only twelve thousand; but the apparent inconsistency is
   easily explained. It is Abishai whom the history represents as
   defeating the forces, which are here said to have been overthrown by
   Joab. We are to consider that the army was divided between the two
   brothers. Abishai being inferior in rank and authority, we need not
   wonder that the praise of the victory is ascribed to him who was the
   chief commander, although both had a share in gaining it; as in 1
   Samuel 18:7, David is described as having the whole honor of the
   victory, because he was the individual under whose auspices it had been
   accomplished. It is probable that about half the number mentioned in
   the history fell during the main engagement, and that the rest having
   fled from the field, were put to the sword by Joab in their retreat.

   Psalm 60:1-3

   1. O God! thou hast cast us off; thou hast scattered us; thou hast been
   displeased: O turn thyself to us again! 2. Thou hast made the earth [or
   the land] to tremble; thou hast caused it to open wide: heal the
   breaches thereof; for it shaketh. 3. Thou hast showed thy people hard
   things: thou hast made us drunk with the wine of astonishment. [382]


   1. O God! thou hast cast us off. With the view of exciting both himself
   and others to a more serious consideration of the goodness of God,
   which they presently experienced, he begins the psalm with prayer; and
   a comparison is instituted, designed to show that the government of
   Saul had been under the divine reprobation. He complains of the sad
   confusions into which the nation had been thrown, and prays that God
   would return to it in mercy, and re-establish its affairs. Some have
   thought that David here adverts to his own distressed condition: this
   is not probable. I grant that, before coming to the throne, he
   underwent severe afflictions; but in this place he evidently speaks of
   the whole people as well as himself. The calamities which he describes
   are such as extended to the whole kingdom; and I have not the least
   doubt, therefore, that he is to be considered as drawing a comparison
   which might illustrate the favor of God, as it had been shown so
   remarkably, from the first, to his own government. With this view, he
   deplores the long-continued and heavy disasters which had fallen upon
   the people of God under Saul's administration. It is particularly
   noticeable, that though he had found his own countrymen his worst and
   bitterest foes, now that he sat upon the throne, he forgets all the
   injuries which they had done him, and, mindful only of the situation
   which he occupied, associates himself with the rest of them in his
   addresses to God. The scattered condition of the nation is what he
   insists upon as the main calamity. In consequence of the dispersion of
   Saul's forces, the country lay completely exposed to the incursions of
   enemies; not a man was safe in his own house, and no relief remained
   but in flight or banishment. He next describes the confusions which
   reigned by a metaphor, representing the country as opened, or cleft
   asunder; not that there had been a literal earthquake, but that the
   kingdom, in its rent and shattered condition, presented that calamitous
   aspect which generally follows upon an earthquake. The affairs of Saul
   ceased to prosper from the time that he forsook God; and when he
   perished at last, he left the nation in a state little short of ruin.
   The greatest apprehension must have been felt throughout it; it was
   become the scorn of its enemies, and was ready to submit to any yoke,
   however degrading, which promised tolerable conditions. Such is the
   manner in which David intimates that the divine favor had been
   alienated by Saul, pointing, when he says that God was displeased, at
   the radical source of all the evils which prevailed; and he prays that
   the same physician who had broken would heal.

   3. Thou hast showed thy people hard things He says, first, that the
   nation had been dealt with severely, and then adds a figure which may
   additionally represent the grievousness of its calamities, speaking of
   it as drunk with the wine of stupor or astonishment. Even the Hebraist
   interpreters are not agreed among themselves as to the meaning of trlh,
   tarelah, which I have rendered astonishment. Several of them translate
   it poison. But it is evident that the Psalmist alludes to some kind of
   poisoned drink, which deprives a person of his senses, insinuating that
   the Jews were stupified by their calamities. [383] He would place, in
   short, before their eyes the curse of God, which had pressed upon the
   government of Saul, and induce them to abandon their obstinate attempts
   to maintain the interests of a throne which lay under the divine
   reprobation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [382] The three first verses, which complain of calamities and
   distresses, seem not to correspond to the title of the psalm, from
   which we would naturally expect the expressions of joy and praise for
   the victory obtained. Hare conjectures that these three verses have
   accidentally changed place with Psalm 85:2, 3, 4. Archbishop Secker
   observes, that this conjecture "is bold, but otherwise very ingenious
   and plausible; and this change would make each psalm more consistent,
   and reconcile this psalm to its title very well; for the historical
   books mention no distress in the war to which the title refers." Dr
   Adam Clarke considers this conjecture well founded; but others think
   the apparent discrepancy may be removed by supposing that the psalm was
   written after some of the battles of which mention is made in the
   title, and that the Author does not restrict himself to those events,
   but takes in a wider range, so as to embrace the afflictive condition
   both of Israel and Judah during the latter part of Saul's life, and the
   former years of David's reign.

   [383] It was customary among the Hebrews to make their wine stronger
   and more inebriating by the addition of hotter and more powerful
   ingredients; such as honey, spices, defrutum, (i e., wine inspissated
   by boiling it down to two-thirds or one-half of the quantity,)
   mandrakes, opiates, and other drugs. Such were the stupifying
   ingredients which the celebrated Helen is represented, in Homer's
   Odyssey, as mixing in the bowl, together with the wine, for her guests
   oppressed with grief, to raise their spirits; and such is probably the
   wine to which there is here an allusion. The people were stupified by
   the heavy judgments of God, like a person stupified with wine which had
   been rendered more intoxicating by the deleterious drugs with which it
   had been mingled. This highly poetical language is not unfrequently
   employed to express the divine judgments: as in Isaiah 51:17, 20-22,
   and Jeremiah 25:15, 16. The original word trlh, tarelah, means properly
   trembling, from the verb rl, raal, from which the English word reel is
   perhaps derived. We might therefore read, "the wine of trembling."

   Psalm 60:4-8

   4. Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be
   displayed before the truth. Selah. 5. That thy beloved may be
   delivered, [384] save with thy right hand, and hear me. 6. God hath
   spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice: I will divide Shechem, and mete
   out the valley of Succoth. 7. Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine;
   Ephraim also is mine strength of my head; Judah is my lawgiver. [385]
   8. Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast my shoe: Palestina,
   triumph over me.


   4 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee. Some interpreters
   would change the past tense, and read the words as if they formed a
   continuation of the prayers which precede -- O that thou wouldst give a
   banner to them that fear thee! [386] But it is better to suppose that
   David diverges to the language of congratulation, and, by pointing to
   the change which had taken place, calls attention to the evident
   appearances of the divine favor. He returns thanks to God, in the name
   of all the people, for having raised a standard which might at once
   cheer their hearts, and unite their divided numbers. [387] It is a poor
   and meagre interpretation which some have attached to the words, before
   the truth, that God showed favor to the Jews because he had found them
   true-hearted, and sound in his cause. Those in the higher ranks had, as
   is well known, proved eminently disloyal; the common people had, along
   with their king, broken their divine allegiance: from the highest to
   the lowest in the kingdom all had conspired to overthrow the gracious
   purpose of God. It is evident, then, that David refers to the truth of
   God as having emerged in a signal manner, now that the Church began to
   be restored. This was an event which had not been expected. Indeed, who
   did not imagine, in the desperate circumstances, that God's promises
   had altogether failed? But when David mounted the throne, his truth,
   which had been so long obscured, again shone forth. The advantage which
   ensued extended to the whole nation; but David intimates that God had a
   special respect to his own people, whose deliverance, however few they
   might be in number, he particularly contemplated.

   He next proceeds to address God again in prayer; although, I may
   observe in passing, the words which follow, that thy beloved may be
   delivered, are read by some in connection with the preceding verse. I
   am myself inclined to adopt that construction; for David would seem to
   magnify the illustration which had been given of the divine favor, by
   adverting to the change which had taken place, [388] God having
   inspirited his people so far as to display a banner; where, formerly,
   they were reduced to a state of extremity, from which it seemed
   impossible to escape without a miracle. In the previous verse he calls
   them fearers of the Lord, and now his beloved; implying that, when God
   rewards such as fear and worship him, it is always with a respect to
   his own free love. And prayer is subjoined: for however great may be
   the favors which God has bestowed upon us, modesty and humility will
   teach us always to pray that he would perfect what his goodness has
   begun.

   6. God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice. Hitherto he has
   adverted to the proofs which had come under their own observation, and
   from which they might easily see that God had manifested his favor in a
   manner new, and for many years unprecedented. He had raised the nation
   from a state of deep distress to prosperity, and had changed the aspect
   of affairs so far, that one victory was following another in rapid
   succession. But now he calls their attention to a point of still
   greater importance, the divine promise -- the fact that God had
   previously declared all this with his own mouth. However numerous and
   striking may be the practical demonstrations we receive of the favor of
   God, we can never recognize them, except in connection with his
   previously revealed promise. What follows, although spoken by David as
   of himself individually, may be considered as the language adopted by
   the people generally, of whom he was the political head. Accordingly,
   he enjoins them, provided they were not satisfied with the sensible
   proofs of divine favor, to reflect upon the oracle by which he had been
   made king in terms the most distinct and remarkable. [389] He says that
   God had spoken in his holiness, not by his Holy Spirit, as some, with
   an over-refinement of interpretation, have rendered it, nor by his holy
   place, the sanctuary; [390] for we read of no response having been
   given from it to the prophet Samuel. It is best to retain the term
   holiness, as he adverts to the fact of the truth of the oracle having
   been confirmed, and the constancy and efficacy of the promise having
   been placed beyond all doubt by numerous proof, of a practical kind. As
   no room had been left for question upon the point, he employs this
   epithet to put honor upon the words which had been spoken by Samuel. He
   immediately adds, that this word of God was the chief ground upon which
   he placed his trust. It might be true that he had gained many
   victories, and that these had tended to encourage his heart; but he
   intimates, that no testimony which he had received of this kind gave
   him so much satisfaction as the word. This accords with the general
   experience of the Lord's people. Cheered, as they unquestionably are,
   by every expression of the divine goodness, still faith must ever be
   considered as holding the highest place -- as being that which
   dissipates their worst sorrows, and quickens them even when dead to a
   happiness which is not of this world. Nor does David mean that he
   merely rejoiced himself. He includes, in general, all who feared the
   Lord in that Kingdom. And now he proceeds to give the sum of the
   oracle, which it is observable that he does in such a way as to show,
   in the very narration of it, how firmly he believed in its truth: for
   he speaks of it as something which admitted of no doubt whatsoever, and
   boasts that he would do what God had promised. I will divide Shechem,
   he says, and mete out the valley of Succoth [391] The parts which he
   names are those that were more late of coming into his possession, and
   which would appear to have been yet in the hands of Saul's son, when
   this psalm was written. A severe struggle being necessary for their
   acquisition, he asserts that, though late of being subdued, they would
   certainly be brought under his subjection in due time, as God had
   condescended to engage this by his word. So with Gilead and Manasseh
   [392] As Ephraim was the most populous of all the tribes, he
   appropriately terms it the strength of his head, that is, of his
   dominions. [393] To procure the greater credit to the oracle, by
   showing that it derived a sanction from antiquity, he adds, that Judah
   would be his lawgiver, or chief; which was equivalent to saying, that
   the posterity of Abraham could never prosper unless, in agreeableness
   to the prediction of the patriarch Jacob, they were brought under the
   government of Judah, or of one who was sprung from that tribe. He
   evidently alludes to what is narrated by Moses, (Genesis 49:10,) "The
   scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his
   feet, until Shiloh come." The same word is there used, mchvqq,
   Mechokek, or legislator. It followed, that no government could stand
   which was not resident in the tribe of Judah, this being the decree and
   the good pleasure of God. The words are more appropriate in the mouth
   of the people than of David; and, as already remarked, he does not
   speak in his own name, but in that of the Church at large.

   8 Moab is my wash-pot In proceeding to speak of foreigners, he observes
   a wide distinction between them and his own countrymen. The posterity
   of Abraham he would govern as brethren, and not as slaves; but it was
   allowable for him to exercise greater severities upon the profane and
   the uncircumcised, in order to their being brought under forcible
   subjection. In this he affords no precedent to conquerors who would
   inflict lawless oppression upon nations taken in war; for they want the
   divine warrant and commission which David had, invested as he was not
   only with the authority of a king, but with the character of an avenger
   of the Church, especially of its more implacable enemies, such as had
   thrown off every feeling of humanity, and persisted in harassing a
   people descended from the same stock with themselves. He remarks, in
   contempt of the Moabites, that they would be a vessel in which he
   should wash his feet, the washing of the feet being, as is well known,
   a customary practice in Eastern nations. [394] With the same view he
   speaks of casting his shoe over Edom. This is expressive of reproach,
   and intimates, that as it had once insulted over the chosen people of
   God, so now it should be reduced to servitude. [395] What follows
   concerning Palestina is ambiguous. By some the words are taken
   ironically, as if David would deride the vain boastings of the
   Philistines, who were constantly assaulting him with all the petulance
   which they could command. [396] And the Hebrew verb rv, ruang, though
   it means in general to shout with triumph, signifies also to make a
   tumult, as soldiers when they rush to battle. Others, without supposing
   any ironical allusion, take the words as they stand, and interpret them
   as meaning servile plaudits; that much and obstinately as they hated
   his dominion, they would be forced to hail and applaud him as
   conqueror. Thus in Psalm 18:44, it is said, "The sons of the strangers
   shall feign submission to me." [397]

   [384] "Ou, que tes bien aimez soyont delivrez." -- Fr. marg. "Or, let
   thy beloved be delivered."

   [385] "Ou, gouverneur." -- Fr. marg. "Or, governor."

   [386] Boothroyd gives a translation similar to this, and thinks that
   this is required by the connection. But see note 3, p. 397.

   [387] Hamer has given a very ingenious explanation of this passage,
   derived from the manners of the East. "It seems," says he, "that the
   modern Eastern people have looked upon the giving them a banner as a
   more sure pledge of protection than that given by words.' So Albertus
   Aquensis tell us, that when Jerusalem was taken in 1099, about three
   hundred Saracens got upon the roof of a very lofty building, and
   earnestly begged for quarter, but could not be induced, by any promises
   of safety, to come down, until they had received the banner of Tancred
   [one of the chiefs of the Crusade army] as a pledge of life. It did
   not, indeed, avail them, as that historian observes; for their behavior
   occasioned such indignation that they were destroyed to a man. The
   event showed the faithlessness of these zealots, whom no solemnities
   could bind; but the Saracens surrendering themselves upon the delivery
   of a standard to them, proves in what a strong light they looked upon
   the giving them a banner; since it induced them to trust it when they
   would not trust any promises. Perhaps the delivery of a banner was
   anciently esteemed, in like manner, an obligation to protect, and the
   Psalmist might consider it in this light, when, upon a victory gained
   over the Syrians and Edomites, after the public affairs of Israel had
   been in a bad state, he says, Thou hast showed thy people hard things,
   etc.; thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee.' Though thou
   didst for a time give up thine Israel into the hands of their enemies,
   thou hast now given them an assurance of thy having received them under
   thy protection." -- Observations, volume 3, pp. 496, 497. Harmer
   supposes that our translation, which speaks of a banner displayed, is
   inaccurate; observing, that it is most probable that the Israelites
   anciently used only a spear, properly ornamented to distinguish it from
   a common one -- a supposition which he founds on the fact, that a very
   long spear, covered all over with silver, and having a ball of gold on
   the top, was the standard of the Egyptian princes at the time of the
   Crusade wars, and was carried before their armies. He proposes to read,
   "Thou hast given an ensign or standard [nm, nes] to them that fear
   thee, that it may be lifted up." But Parkhurst considers the radical
   meaning of the Hebrew word nm, nes, to be a banner or ensign, from its
   waving or streaming in the wind; in other words, a streamer See his
   Lexicon on nm. Mant's explanation of the phrase is similar to that of
   Calvin. "In this place," says he, "it may mean no more than that God
   had united his people under one head, and so enabled them to meet their
   enemies by repairing to the standard of their sovereign." "The banner,
   or standard of an army," says Walford, "is the object of constant
   attention to soldiers: so long as it is safe, and elevated, so long
   courage, hope, and energy, are maintained. The poet uses this symbol to
   express his hope that God Himself would be the source of their valor
   and success, in order that the truth, the promise made to David, might
   be accomplished."

   [388] The Latin is here concise -- "Nam in ipsa varietate David
   magnitudinem gratiae commendat." Accordingly, the French version
   amplifies the passage -- "Car David en proposant la diversite et la
   changement d'un temps a l'autre magnifie," etc.

   [389] "Cum praeclaris elogiis." -- Lat. Amplified in the French version
   as follows: -- "l'ornant de titres excellens, et lui faisant des
   promesses authentiques."

   [390] This is the reading of Mudge, Street, Archbishop Secker, and
   Morrison. "Should not the word be read, in his sanctuary? whence the
   divine oracles were issued forth. David, having received a favorable
   answer, perhaps by Urim and Thummim, delivers himself in a strain of
   the fullest confidence of victory over his enemies." -- Dimock.

   [391] Shechem lay in Samaria, and, therefore, by it the whole of
   Samaria may be intended. The valley of Succoth, or booths, received its
   name from Jacob's making booths, and feeding his cattle there. (See
   Genesis 33:17, 18.) It lay beyond the Jordan, and it may be employed to
   designate the whole of that district of country. Though Samaria, and
   the country beyond the Jordan, were now in the hands of the enemy, yet
   David anticipates the time when he would gain complete and absolute
   possession of them, which he expresses by dividing, and meting them
   out. The allusion is to the dividing and measuring out of land; and it
   was a part of the power of a king to distribute his kingdom into cities
   and provinces, and to place judges and magistrates over them.

   [392] Gilead and Manasseh were beyond the Jordan. The tribe of Gad,
   which was in Gilead, was distinguished for its warlike valor.

   [393] This tribe was also distinguished for its valor. (Deuteronomy
   33:17; Psalm 78:9; see also Genesis 48:19.)

   [394] This office of washing the feet was in the East commonly
   performed by slaves, and the meanest of the family, as appears from
   what Abigail said to David when he took her to wife, "Behold, let thine
   handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord," 1
   Samuel. 25:41; and from the fact of our Savior washing his disciples'
   feet, to give them an example of humility, John 13:5. The word nipter,
   used in this last passage, signifies in general a washing pot, and is
   put for the word podoniptron, the term which the Greeks, in strict
   propriety of speech, applied to a vessel for washing the feet. As this
   office was servile, so the vessels employed for this purpose were a
   mean part of household stuff. Gataker and Le Clerc illustrate this text
   from an anecdote related by Herodotus, concerning Amasis, king of
   Egypt, who expressed the meanness of his own origin by comparing
   himself to a pot for washing the feet in, (Herod., Lib. 2, c. 172.)
   When, therefore, it is said, Moab is my washing-pot,' the complete and
   servile subjection of Moab to David is strongly marked. This is
   expressed not by comparing Moab to a slave who performs the lowest
   offices, as presenting to his master the basin for washing his feet,
   but by comparing him to the mean utensil itself. See 2 Samuel 8:2; 1
   Chronicles 18:1, 2, 12, 13

   [395] Edom or Idumea was inhabited by the Edomites, or posterity of
   Edom, that is, Esau, (the elder brother of Jacob,) who, on account of
   his profanity in selling his birthright for a mess of red pottage --
   called in Hebrew Edom -- had this name imposed upon him to the
   perpetual disgrace of himself and his posterity, (Genesis 25:30; 36:8,
   9; Hebrews 12:16.) The expression, "Over Edom will I cast my shoe," has
   been differently explained by interpreters. Some, as Gataker and
   Martin, read, "To Edom will I cast my shoe;" and suppose that the
   reference is to the custom which then prevailed, of the master
   employing his meanest servant to untie, take off, and cleanse his
   shoes, (Matthew 3:11; Luke 3:16;) and that David intimates, that the
   Edomites would become his menial slaves, who would perform to him the
   lowest offices. "And the prophet," observes Martin, "uses the word
   throw, which marks an action done in a passionate and angry manner, in
   allusion to the circumstance that masters, when employing their
   servants with whom they are displeased to take off their shoes, hold
   out their feet to them with violence, as if they would thrust their
   feet against them." The LXX. and Vulgate read, "will extend my shoe."
   And Bishop Horne is of opinion, that the meaning is, "extending his
   shoe," that is to say, putting his feet upon them; and this, it is well
   known, was the manner in which Eastern conquerors were wont to treat
   their captives. But there is another ancient custom to which others
   suppose the passage refers. The ancients were wont to throw their shoes
   and sandals, when soiled with dirt, into some obscure corner before
   they sat down to meat, and many might possibly have some mean place in
   their houses into which they commonly threw them; and, therefore, the
   throwing of the shoe over or on Edom might mean, as Bucer expounds it,
   "Edom will be as the place into which I cast my shoe." But whatever may
   be the precise allusion, the meaning conveyed undoubtedly is, that
   David would make a complete conquest of Edom, that he would reduce it
   to the lowest subjection. And such was actually the case, as we learn
   from 2 Samuel 8:14. "Abu Walid would have nl here to signify a fetter,
   -- I will cast my fetter or chain on him:' and so Kimchi, in his roots;
   though in his comment here he interpret it in the notion of a shoe." --
   Hammond

   [396] "The apostrophe to Philistia is the language of irony and of
   defiance. -- Philistia, triumph thou over me!' as if he had said, Thou
   hast been used to insult and triumph over me; but circumstances are now
   reversed, and it is my turn to shout and triumph over thee.' See Psalm
   108:9." Williams' Cottage Bible.

   [397] "Philistia, be thou glad of me, rather, Philistia, welcome we (as
   thy conqueror) with shouts; a hard task for the vanquished to perform."
   -- Cresswell Bishop Horne reads, "Over Philistia give a shout of
   triumph." Horsley reads, "Over Philistia is my shout of triumph." "I
   take," says he, "htryy for a noun substantive, with the pronoun of the
   first person suffixed."

   who didst not go out with our armies? 11. Give us help from trouble:
   for vain is the help of man. [398] 12. Through God we shall do
   valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.


   9 Who will bring me into the fortified city? Anticipating an objection
   which might be alleged, he proceeds to state that he looked to God for
   the accomplishment of what remained to be done in the capture of the
   fortified places of his enemies, and the consolidation of his
   victories. It might be said, that as a considerable number continued to
   resist his claims, the confident terms which he had used were
   premature. God, however, had pledged his word that every nation which
   set itself in opposition to him would be brought under his power, and
   in the face of remaining difficulties and dangers he advances with
   certainty of success. By the fortified city, [399] some understand
   Rabbah, the capital of the Moabites. Others, with more probability,
   consider that the singular is used for the plural number, and that
   David alludes in general to the different cities under protection of
   which his enemies were determined to stand out. He declares, that the
   same God who had crowned his arms with victory in the open field would
   lead him on to the siege of these cities. With a view to prove his
   legitimate call to the government, he amplifies a second time the marks
   of the divine favor which it had received, by contrasting it with that
   which preceded. "The God," he says, "who had formerly cast us off, and
   abandoned us to unsuccessful warfare, will now lay open before me the
   gates of hostile cities, and enable me to break through all their
   fortifications."

   11 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. Again he
   reverts to the exercise of prayer, or rather is led to it naturally by
   the very confidence of hope, which we have seen that he entertained. He
   expresses his conviction, that should God extend his help, it would be
   sufficient of itself, although no assistance should be received from
   any other quarter. Literally it reads, Give us help from trouble, and
   vain is the help of man "O God," as if he had said, "when pleased to
   put forth thy might, thou needest none to help thee; and when,
   therefore, once assured of an interest in thy favor, there is no reason
   why we should desire the aid of man. All other resources of a worldly
   nature vanish before the brightness of thy power." The copulative in
   the verse, however, has been generally resolved into the causal
   particle, and I have not scrupled to follow the common practice. It
   were well if the sentiment expressed were effectually engraven upon our
   hearts. Why is it almost universally the case with men that they are
   either staggered in their resolution, or buoy themselves up with
   confidences, vain, because not derived from God, but just because they
   have no apprehension of that salvation which he can extend, which is of
   itself sufficient, and without which, any earthly succor is entirely
   ineffectual? In contrasting the help of God with that of man, he
   employs language not strictly correct, for, in reality, there is no
   such thing as a power in man to deliver at all. But, in our ignorance,
   we conceive as if there were various kinds of help in the world, and he
   uses the word in accommodation to our false ideas. God, in
   accomplishing our preservation, may use the agency of man, but he
   reserves it to himself, as his peculiar prerogative, to deliver, and
   will not suffer them to rob him of his glory. The deliverance which
   comes to us in this manner through human agency must properly be
   ascribed to God. All that David meant to assert is, that such
   confidences as are not derived from God are worthless and vain. And to
   confirm this position, he declares in the last verse of the psalm, that
   as, on the one hand, we can do nothing without him, so, on the other,
   we can do all things by his help. Two things are implied in the
   expression, through God we shall do valiantly; [400] first, that if God
   withdraw his favor, any supposed strength which is in man will soon
   fail; and, on the other hand, that those whose sufficiency is derived
   from God only are armed with courage to overcome every difficulty. To
   show that it is no mere half credit which he gives God, he adds, in
   words which ascribe the whole work to him, that it is he who shall
   tread down our enemies Thus, even in our controversy with creatures
   like ourselves, we are not at liberty to share the honor of success
   with God; and must it not be accounted greater sacrilege still when men
   set free will in opposition to divine grace, and speak of their
   concurring equally with God in the matter of procuring eternal
   salvation? Those who arrogate the least fraction of strength to
   themselves apart from God, only ruin themselves through their own
   pride.

   [399] Literally, "the strong city," or "the city of strength." The
   Chaldee makes it Tyre, the capital of Phoenicia. Mudge and others think
   Petra, the capital of Idumea, is meant. Viewed as referring to that
   remarkable city, which was hewn out of the rock, and deemed
   impregnable, (Obadiah, 3d verse,) and with which Burckhardt, Laborde,
   Stephens, and other modern travelers, have made us so minutely
   acquainted; the language of the Psalmist is very appropriate,
   illustrating the strength of his faith, and magnifying the greatness of
   the divine aid. Who will bring me into the fortified city? it is
   impossible for me, by my own strength, or by mere human aid, to occupy
   this stronghold, unless God interpose in my behalf, assist, and prosper
   my attempts.

   [400] Street supposes that this psalm was composed before the battle of
   Helam, which is recorded in 1 Chronicles 19:16, where David beat the
   Syrians of Mesopotamia and the Syrians of Zobah; and, farther, that
   this psalm might have been sung by the armies of Israel when they were
   marching out to that battle, triumphantly commemorating their former
   victories, and avowing their hopes of gaining another by the help of
   the Almighty. On this verse he observes: "it was a constant practice
   among the bravest nations of the Greeks, for the troops to advance to
   battle chanting some kind of song." And, after quoting some lines which
   were sung by the Spartan soldiery, he adds, "The Grecian poet avails
   himself of the love of glory, and the ties of domestic affection, to
   animate his troops; but the Hebrew makes use of the more powerful
   stimulus of religious enthusiasm."

   [381] There is another way in which this difference as to number may be
   reconciled besides that in which Calvin attempts to do it. "If the
   Hebrew numbers here," says Street, "have been ever expressed by letters
   used as numerals, the variation might be accounted for; yv being
   twelve, and ych being eighteen, and many instances being to be found of
   the corruption of ch into v. -- See Dr Kennicott's Dissertation on 1
   Chronicles 11, page 96, where it is plainly shown that many errors in
   numbers have arisen from the numbers having been expressed by letters,
   and one letter having been mistaken for another."

   PSALM 61

   This psalm begins with prayer, or, at any rate, with the brief record
   of a prayer, which David had preferred to God in a season of deep
   distress. It is chiefly occupied, however, with the praises of God,
   expressing his thankfulness for a miraculous deliverance which he had
   experienced from some imminent danger, and for his establishment upon
   the throne.

   To the chief musician upon Neginoth, A Psalm of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 61:1-4

   1. Hear my cry, O God! attend unto my prayer. 2. Prom the end of the
   earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is vexed: thou shalt lead me
   to the rock which is too high for me. [401] 3. For thou hast been my
   hope, a tower of strength from the face of the enemy. 4. I will abide
   in thy tabernacle for ever; I will be safe under the covert of thy
   wings. Selah.


   1. Hear my cry, O God! It is not exactly ascertained at what time this
   psalm was composed; but there seems to be some probability in the
   conjecture, that David had been for a considerable period in possession
   of the throne before he fell into the circumstances of distress which
   are here mentioned. I agree with those who refer it to the time of the
   conspiracy of Absalom; [402] for, had he not been an exile, he could
   not speak, as in the second verse, of crying from the ends of the
   earth. By using the term cry, he would intimate the vehemency of his
   desire; and it is a word which expresses inward fervency of spirit,
   without reference to the fact whether he may have prayed aloud, or in a
   low and subdued tone. The repetition which is employed denotes his
   diligence and perseverance in prayer, and teaches us that we should not
   faint and become discouraged in this exercise, because God may not have
   immediately and openly testified his acceptance of our petitions. There
   can be no question that, by the ends of the earth, he refers to the
   place of his banishment, as being cut off from access to the temple and
   the royal city. By some, indeed, the words have been understood
   figuratively, as meaning, that he prayed from the lowest deeps of
   distress; but I can see no foundation for this. In a subsequent part of
   the psalm, he calls himself King, a title never assumed by him before
   the death of Saul, and from this circumstance we may at once infer,
   that the time referred to was that when he fled in trepidation from the
   fury of his son Absalom, and hid himself in the wilderness of Mahanaim,
   and places of a similarly solitary description. Mount Zion was the
   place where the ark of the covenant had been deposited, and it was the
   seat of royalty; and David, when banished from this, which was the
   principal and most eligible locality, speaks as if he had been driven
   to the uttermost parts of the earth. Living, though he did, under the
   shadows of a legal dispensation, he did not cease to pray, because
   removed to a distance from the temple; and how inexcusable must our
   conduct be, privileged as we are of God, and called to draw near by the
   way which has been opened through the blood of Christ, if we break not
   through every hinderance which Satan presents to our communications
   with heaven? Let those who may have been deprived of the hearing of the
   word, and the dispensation of the sacraments, so as, in a manner, to be
   banished out of the Church, learn from the example of David to
   persevere in crying to God, even under these solitary circumstances. He
   adverts, in what follows, to his grief and anguish. He adds the fact of
   his being shut up from every method of escape, that the grace of God
   might be made more apparent in his deliverance. The Hebrew word tph,
   ataph, which I have translated vexed, means occasionally to cover, or
   involve, which has led some to render the clause, while my heart is
   turned about; that is, tossed hither and thither, or agitated. This is
   a harsh translation. Others read with more propriety, while my heart is
   involved in cares and troubles, or overwhelmed. [403] I have adopted a
   simpler rendering, although I would not be understood as denying the
   metaphor, to which they suppose that there is an allusion. The clause,
   there can be no question, is inserted to intimate that he was not
   prevented by trouble from having recourse to God. Notice was taken
   already of the outward trial to which he was subjected, in distance
   from the sanctuary, and of his rising above this, so as to direct his
   cry to God; and in the words before us, we have his confession that he
   was far from being stoically insensible, being conscious of a severe
   inward struggle with grief and perplexity of mind. It is the duty,
   then, of believers, when oppressed with heaviness and spiritual
   distress, to make only the more strenuous efforts for breaking through
   these obstacles in their approaches to God. His prayer is, that God
   would bring him to that safety from which he seems to be excluded. By a
   rock or citadel, he means, in general, secure protection, from which he
   complains of being shut out, as it was impossible to reach it unless he
   were raised by the hand of God. In looking round him, it seemed as if
   every place of shelter and safety were lifted up above his head and
   rendered inaccessible. He was cut off from all help, and yet, hopeless
   as deliverance appeared, he had no doubt of his safety, should God only
   extend his hand for interposition. This is the plain meaning of the
   passage, when divested of figure, that God was able to rescue him from
   danger, though all other help should be withdrawn, and the whole world
   should stand between him and deliverance; a truth which we would do
   well to consider seriously. In looking for deliverance from God, we
   must beware of yielding to the suggestions of sense; we should remember
   that he does not always work by apparent means, but delivers us when he
   chooses by methods inscrutable to reason. If we attempt to prescribe
   any one particular line of procedure, we do no less than wilfully limit
   his almighty power.

   3. For thou hast been my hope Here we may suppose, either that he calls
   to his remembrance such benefits as he had formerly received, or that
   he congratulates himself upon deliverance which he had presently
   experienced. There is much probability in either supposition. Nothing
   animates our hopes more than the recollection of the past goodness of
   God, and, in the midst of his prayers, we frequently find David
   indulging in reflections of this kind. On the other hand, the remainder
   of the psalm is occupied with returning praise to God for his present
   goodness; and there is no reason why we should not suppose, that these
   words before us form the commencement of the thanksgiving. In that
   case, the Hebrew particle, which we have rendered for or because, may
   be understood rather in an affirmative sense, surely or certainly.

   In the verse which follows, he expresses the confidence which he had
   that he would dwell from this time forth in the sanctuary of the Lord.
   I cannot altogether agree with those who think that David was still in
   his state of exile from his native country when this was written, and
   is merely to be understood as promising to himself the certainty of his
   return. He would seem rather to be rejoicing in restoration already
   obtained, than assuaging his grief by anticipation of it in the future;
   and this will be still more apparent, when we come to consider the
   immediate context. It is noticeable, that now when he was returned from
   his banishment, and established within his own palace, his heart was
   set more upon the worship of God than all the wealth, splendor, and
   pleasures of royalty. We have his testimony in other parts of his
   writings, that in the worst calamities which he endured, he experienced
   nothing which could be compared to the bitterness of being shut out
   from the ordinances of religion; and now he accounts it a higher
   pleasure to lie as a suppliant before the altar, than to sit upon the
   throne of a king. By the words which immediately follow, he shows that
   he did not, like too many uninformed persons, attach a superstitious
   importance to the mere externals of religion, adding, that he found his
   safety under the shadow of God's wings. Ignorant persons might conceive
   of God as necessarily confined to the outward tabernacle, but David
   only improved this symbol of the Divine presence as a means of
   elevating the spiritual exercises of his faith. I would not deny that
   there may be an allusion to the cherubim when he speaks of the shadow
   of God's wings. Only we must remember, that David did not rest in
   carnal ordinances, the elements of the world, [404] but rose by them
   and above them to the spiritual worship of God.

   Psalm 61:5-8

   5. For thou, O God! hast heard my vows: thou hast given inheritance to
   those [405] fearing thy name. 6. Thou shalt add days upon days to the
   king, and his years as generation upon generation. 7. He shalt abide
   before the face of God for ever: prepare mercy and truth; let them keep
   him. 8. So will I sing unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform
   my vows.


   5. For thou, O God! hast heard my vows. He here shows the grounds upon
   which he had spoken of his abiding under the wings of God. The sudden
   joy which he experienced arose from the circumstance of God's having
   heard his prayers, and made light to spring out of darkness. By his
   vows we must understand his prayers, according to a common figure of
   speech by which the part is taken for the whole, having made vows when
   he prayed. In general, he would acknowledge himself indebted for his
   restoration entirely to an interposition of Divine power, and not to
   any dexterity which he had shown in gaining time for the collection of
   his forces, [406] nor to any assistance which he had derived, either
   from the favor of the priests or the exertions of his soldiers. Had the
   letter l, lamed, been prefixed to the Hebrew word yr'y, yirey, which is
   rendered fearing, there would have been no reason left to doubt that
   the words which follow were of the nature of a general assertion, to
   the effect, that God has given the inheritance to those who fear him.
   As it is, they may be construed to mean, that God had given David the
   inheritance of those who fear him. Still I prefer attaching the more
   general sense to the words, and understand them as intimating that God
   never disappoints his servants, but crowns with everlasting happiness
   the struggles and the distresses which may have exercised their faith.
   They convey an implied censure of that unwarrantable confidence which
   is indulged in by the wicked, when favored, through the divine
   forbearance, with any interval of prosperity. The success which
   flatters them is merely imaginary, and speedily vanishes. But
   inheritance -- the word here employed by David -- suggests that the
   people of God enjoy a species of prosperity more solid and enduring;
   their momentary and short-lived troubles having only the effect of
   promoting their eternal welfare. He praises God that those who fear his
   name are not left to the poor privilege of rejoicing for a few days,
   but secured in a permanent heritage of happiness. The truth is one
   which cannot be questioned. The wicked, having no possession by faith
   of the divine benefits which they may happen to share, live on from day
   to day, as it were, upon plunder. It is only such as fear the Lord who
   have the true and legitimate enjoyment of their blessings.

   6. Thou shalt add days upon days to the king etc. [407] David cannot be
   considered as using these words of gratulation with an exclusive
   reference to himself. It is true that he lived to an extreme old age,
   and died full of days, leaving the kingdom in a settled condition, and
   in the hands of his son, who succeeded him; but he did not exceed the
   period of one man's life, and the greater part of it was spent in
   continued dangers and anxieties. There can be no doubt, therefore, that
   the series of years, and even ages, of which he speaks, extends
   prospectively to the coming of Christ, it being the very condition of
   the kingdom, as I have often remarked, that God maintained them as one
   people under one head, or, when scattered, united them again. The same
   succession still subsists in reference to ourselves. Christ must be
   viewed as living in his members to the end of the world. To this Isaiah
   alludes, when he says, "Who shall declare his generation or age?" --
   words in which he predicts that the Church would survive through all
   ages, notwithstanding the incessant danger of destruction to which it
   is exposed through the attacks of its enemies, and the many storms
   assailing it. So here David foretells the uninterrupted succession of
   the kingdom down to the time of Christ.

   7. He shall abide before the face of God for ever. This is only a
   simpler way of expressing what he had said before, I will abide in thy
   tabernacle for ever. He refers to the security and peace which he would
   enjoy under the protection of God, who would effectually preserve his
   life. By the face of God, must be meant the fatherly care and
   providence which he extends to his people. So numerous are the dangers
   which surround us, that we could not stand a single moment, if his eye
   did not watch over our preservation. But the true security for a happy
   life lies in being persuaded that we are under divine government. There
   follows a prayer that God would appoint mercy and truth for preserving
   the king. And this admits of two meanings. As clemency and truth are
   the best safeguards of a kingdom, it would not be altogether
   unreasonable to suppose that David prays here to be endued with these
   dispositions, as a means of establishing his throne. But the other
   meaning is perhaps preferable, that God would gird himself with
   clemency and truth in order to the preservation of the king. The Hebrew
   term mnh, manah, signifies not only to prepare, but to set over, or
   appoint; and he speaks as if the true defense of the kingdom was only
   to be found in the mercy and faithfulness of God. He uses the
   expression prepare, or command, to intimate how easily God can provide
   the means necessary for preserving his people. In the concluding words,
   he expresses his resolution to persevere in the constant celebration of
   the praises of God, with a view to fulfilling the vows which he had
   contracted -- and this again may lead us to remark the agreement which
   ought ever to subsist between the two parts of invocation: for David,
   while he applied to God for help, under the pressure of calamity,
   showed himself uniformly grateful when he had experienced deliverance.

   PSALM 62

   The greater part of this psalm is occupied with meditations, in which
   David encourages himself and others to hope in God, and fortifies his
   mind against the assaults of temptation. And as we are ever prone to be
   drawn away from God by the influence which worldly objects exert over
   our senses, perishing and evanescent as these are, occasion is taken to
   show the folly of this, and bring us to a single and entire dependence
   upon God.

   To the chief musician upon Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.

   The fact being ascertained that there was one of the chief singers who
   bore the name of Jeduthun, some have thought that this psalm was
   committed into his hands to be sung, (1 Chronicles 9:16; 16:38, 41; and
   25:1) In the title to Psalm 39, it is sufficiently probable that the
   allusion is to some musician of that family. But this would not seem to
   be the case here; for the psalm is not said to be given to, but upon
   Jeduthun. This has led to the opinion that it formed the beginning of
   some song commonly known at that time. Still the Hebrew particle l, al,
   which we have rendered upon, means frequently for, to, or before; and
   it will consist with the words to suppose, that this psalm was put into
   the hands of the posterity of Jeduthun. [408]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 62:1-2

   1. Nevertheless, my soul is silent towards God: from him is my
   salvation. 2. Nevertheless, he himself is my rock and my salvation, my
   high tower: I shall not be greatly moved.


   1. Nevertheless, my soul is silent towards God. Should the translation
   I have followed be adopted, the psalm is to be considered as beginning
   abruptly, in the usual style of compositions of an impassioned kind.
   [409] Of this we have an instance in Psalm 73, where the prophet, who
   had been agitated with doubts, as we shall see more particularly
   afterwards, suddenly brings his mind to a fixed decision, and, in the
   way of cutting off all further subject of debate, exclaims, "Yet God is
   good to Israel." And so it is, I conceive, in the psalm before us. We
   know that the Lord's people cannot always reach such a measure of
   composure as to be wholly exempt from distraction. They would wish to
   receive the word of the Lord with submission, and to be dumb under his
   correcting hand; but inordinate affections will take possession of
   their minds, and break in upon that peace which they might otherwise
   attain to in the exercise of faith and resignation. Hence the
   impatience we find in many; an impatience which they give vent to in
   the presence of God, and which is an occasion to themselves of much
   trouble and disquietude. The Hebrew particle 'k, ach, is often used in
   an exclusive sense, and has been rendered by some, only; it is also
   employed in an affirmative sense, and has been rendered truly, or
   certainly. But in order to arrive at its full meaning, we must suppose
   that David felt an inward struggle and opposition, which he found it
   necessary to check. Satan had raised a tumult in his affections, and
   wrought a degree of impatience in his mind, which he now curbs; and he
   expresses his resolution to be silent. [410] The word implies a meek
   and submissive endurance of the cross. It expresses the opposite of
   that heat of spirit which would put us into a posture of resistance to
   God. The silence intended is, in short, that composed submission of the
   believer, in the exercise of which he acquiesces in the promises of
   God, gives place to his word, bows to his sovereignty, and suppresses
   every inward murmur of dissatisfaction. The Hebrew word dvmyh, dumiyah,
   which I have rendered is silent, some consider to be the noun; and it
   is of little consequence which translation we adopt.

   The particle 'k, ach, in the second verse, I would render in the same
   way as in the first. The believer triumphs in one encounter with
   temptation only to enter upon another; and here David, who appeared to
   have emerged from his distress, shows that he had still to struggle
   with remaining difficulties. We meet with the same particle no fewer
   than six times throughout the psalm. This, too, may explain the many
   titles which he applies to God, each of which is to be considered as a
   foil by which he would ward off the attacks of the tempter. The
   expression in the close of the verse, I shall not be greatly moved,
   implies his persuasion that he might be overtaken with afflictions,
   (for he was well aware that he could claim no exemption from the common
   lot of humanity,) but his conviction, at the same time, that these
   would not overwhelm him, through the good help of God. We shall find
   him saying afterwards, in so many words, I shall not fall; perhaps
   because he felt, as he advanced in prayer, that he had greater boldness
   in despising affliction. Or the expressions may be taken as synonymous
   in the two places. The truth itself is unquestionable. The believer may
   be overthrown for a time; but as he is no sooner cast down than he is
   raised up again by God, he cannot properly be said to fall. He is
   supported by the Spirit of God, and is not therefore really prostrated
   and overcome.

   affections being tamed and subdued. With respect to the translation of
   our English Bible, "Truly my soul waiteth upon God," Dr Adam Clarke
   remarks, "I do not think that the original will warrant this
   translation." He reads, "Surely to God only is my soul dumb;" which he
   thus explains: "I am subject to God Almighty. He has a right to lay on
   me what He pleases; and what He lays on me is much less than I deserve;
   therefore am I dumb before God. The Vulgate, and, almost all the
   versions, have understood it in this sense: Nonne Deo subjecta erit
   anima mea? Shall not my soul be subject to God?'" With this agree the
   version and interpretation of Calvin.

   Psalm 62:3-6

   3. How long will ye continue mischief against a man? [411] ye shall be
   slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and a fence which has
   been struck. 4. Yet they consult to cast him down from his elevations:
   they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, and curse inwardly.
   Selah. 5. Nevertheless, my soul, be thou silent before God: for my
   expectation is from him. 6. Nevertheless, he is my rock and my
   salvation: my high tower; I shall not fall.


   3. How long will ye continue mischief? The Hebrew word thvttv,
   tehotethu, [412] which I have translated continue, or lengthen out,
   mischief, is rendered by some, to meditate, or imagine mischief, while
   others suppose an allusion to the putting forth of the tongue in sign
   of mockery. It has been rendered also, to rush upon, or assault. The
   sense of the passage seems to be, How long will ye meditate evil
   against a man, and persist in mischievous devices for accomplishing his
   ruin? He has in view the obstinate malice of his enemies, moving every
   stone for his destruction, and forming new plans daily for effecting
   it. The instruction to be learned from his experience is, that we
   should exercise patience, even when our enemies show unwearied cruelty
   in their attempts to destroy us, and are instigated by the devil to
   incessant artifices for our persecution. We may just advert to the
   meaning of the figure which is subjoined. Some think that the wicked
   are compared to a bowing wall, because it threatens every moment to
   fall to the ground, and they, upon every sin which they commit, tend
   more and more downwards, till they are precipitated into destruction.
   But it would seem as if the allusion were somewhat different. A wall,
   when ill built, bulges out in the center, presenting the appearance of
   nearly twice its actual breadth; but, as it is hollow within, it soon
   falls to ruins. The wicked, in like manner, are dilated with pride, and
   assume, in their consultations, a most formidable appearance; but David
   predicts that they would be brought to unexpected and utter
   destruction, like a wall badly constructed, and hollow in the interior,
   which falls with a sudden crash, and is broken by its own weight into a
   thousand pieces. [413] The word gdr, gader, which I have rendered, a
   fence, means, properly, an enclosure built of slight and insufficient
   materials; [414] and an epithet is added still more to express the
   violence and impetuosity of their fall. The Psalmist, then, would teach
   us that, high as our enemies may appear to stand, and proud and
   swelling as their denunciations may be, they shall be suddenly and
   signally overthrown, like a smitten wall.

   4. Yet they consult to cast him down from his elevation I still would
   interpret the particle 'k, ach, in an adversative sense. David, on the
   one hand, encouraged himself by determining to rest steadfastly upon
   the promise of divine favor; but, upon the other, he had before him the
   machinations of his enemies, characterised by cruelty, audacity, pride,
   and deceit. By all their attempts, as if he had said, they do nothing
   but precipitate their own fall; still such are the frenzy and the fury
   by which they are actuated, that they persist in their intrigues
   against me. He insinuates that their attacks were directed, not so much
   against himself as against God -- agreeably to the picture which is
   given us of impiety by the poets in their fable of the Giants. [415]
   Nothing will satisfy the enemies of God but setting themselves above
   the heavens. David is to be understood as primarily speaking here of
   himself in the third person, but of himself as elevated expressly by
   the divine hand. Accordingly, though we might consider that God is the
   party directly intended, the scope of the words rather intimates that
   they aimed at the overthrow of one whom God had exalted, and desired to
   establish in honor. In thus attempting to thwart his purpose, they were
   really fighting against God. The clause which follows, they delight in
   lies, has reference to the same thing. Refusing to acknowledge his
   divine vocation, they persevered in following such corrupt designs, as
   could only recoil upon them to their own confusion, as the Psalmist
   exclaims,

   "O ye sons of men! how long is my glory made matter of your reproach?
   how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah." -- (Psalm
   4:2)

   Or the expression may denote the hidden and deceitful measures which
   they adopted in their persecution of this saint of God; for it is
   immediately added, that they blessed with their mouth, but cursed
   inwardly Whatever may be the meaning, it is evident that David,
   contemplating all the treachery, intrigues, and wickedness of his
   enemies, supports himself by the single consideration, that his help
   was in God, and that every opposing instrumentality was therefore vain.

   5. Nevertheless, my soul, be thou silent before God. Here there may
   appear to be a slight inconsistency, inasmuch as he encourages himself
   to do what he had already declared himself to have done. His soul was
   silent before God; and where the necessity of this new silence, as if
   still under agitation of spirit? Here it is to be remembered, that our
   minds can never be expected to reach such perfect composure as shall
   preclude every inward feeling of disquietude, but are, at the best, as
   the sea before a light breeze, fluctuating sensibly, though not swollen
   into billows. It is not without a struggle that the saint can compose
   his mind; and we can very well understand how David should enjoin more
   perfect submission upon a spirit which was already submissive, urging
   upon himself farther advancement in this grace of silence, till he had
   mortified every carnal inclination, and thoroughly subjected himself to
   the will of God. How often, besides, will Satan renew the disquietudes
   which seemed to be effectually expelled? Creatures of such instability,
   and liable to be borne away by a thousand different influences, we need
   to be confirmed again and again. I repeat, that there is no reason to
   be surprised though David here calls upon himself a second time to
   preserve that silence before God, which he might already appear to have
   attained; for, amidst the disturbing motions of the flesh, perfect
   composure is what we never reach. The danger is, that when new winds of
   troubles spring up, we lose that inward tranquillity which we enjoyed,
   and hence the necessity of improving the example of David, by
   establishing ourselves in it more and more. He adds the ground of his
   silence. He had no immediate response from God, but he confidently
   hoped in him. My expectation, he says, is from God. Never, as if he had
   said, will he frustrate the patient waiting of his saints; doubtless my
   silence shall meet with its reward; I shall restrain myself, and not
   make that false haste which will only retard my deliverance.

   [411] "Ou, courrez-vous sus l'homme?" -- Fr. marg. "Or, will ye make
   assaults upon a man?"

   [412] Hammond observes, that this verb "is but once used in the
   Scriptures, and so will not be easily interpreted but either by the
   notion which we find put upon it by the ancient interpreters, or else
   by the Arabic use of it." The Chaldee renders it, raise tumults; the
   Syriac, stir up, instigate, incite, or provoke; the Septuagint and
   Vulgate, assail, or rush upon; and the Arabic, use violence or
   injustice Gesenius gives the sense of the Septuagint. Kimchi and Aben
   Ezra read, pravitatis cogitabitis "Abu Walid compares thvttv with the
   Arabic ththtv, with t, not with th, which signifies to multiply words;
   and so he would have it, according to the use of it in that tongue, to
   signify speaking much against, backbiting, defaming, spreading evil
   reports of, lashing out with your tongues against, for hurt. What he
   thus observes of thvttv, with t, not th, may have place also with the
   word, as we have it; for the root with t, th also in Arabic signifies
   mentiri, to lie, and confusion, injustice, violence; which as well
   agree to his sense as that of the root with t." When David says,
   against a man, and uses also the third person in the fourth verse, it
   is of himself that he speaks. "Against a man; i e., against me, a man
   like yourselves, whom common hmnanity obliges you to pity; a single
   man, who is no fit match for you." -- Poole's Annotations

   [413] Isaiah has also made use of this image to express sudden and
   utter destruction, (chapter 30:13.)

   [414] In the East it is common for the inhabitants to enclose their
   vineyards and gardens with hedges, consisting of various kinds of
   shrubs, and particularly such as are armed with spines. They have also
   mounds of earth-walls about their gardens. Rawwolff describes the
   gardens about Jerusalem as surrounded by mud-walls, not above four feet
   high, easily climbed over, and washed down by rain in a very little
   time. Stone-walls are also frequently used. Thus Egmont or Heyman,
   describing the country about Saphet, a celebrated city of Galilee,
   tells us, "The country round it is finely improved, the declivity being
   covered with vines, supported by low walls. -- Harmer's Observations,
   volume 2, pp. 216-219. Doubdan describes some of these in the Holy Land
   as built of loose stones, without any cement to join them. The original
   word probably means some such "fence" as this. Indeed, it always
   appears to denote a wall of stones: sometimes in express
   contradistinction to the hedge, or thorny fence. -- See Parkhurst's
   Lexicon, on gdr

   [415] "Les Poetes profanes ont dit que les Geans delibererent de
   prendre les plus hautes montagnes et les mettans l'une sur l'autre,
   monter jusques au ciel, pour arracher Jupiter de son siege." -- Fr.
   marg. "It was said by the profane poets that the Giants formed a design
   of taking the highest mountains which they could find piling them one
   above another, scaling the heavens, and taking Jupiter by storm."

   Psalm 62:7-10

   7. In God is my salvation and my glory; the rock of my strength, and my
   hope, is in God. 8. Hope in him at all times; ye people, pour out your
   heart before him: God is our hope. Selah. 9. Nevertheless, the sons of
   Adam are vanity, and the children of men [416] a lie [417] when they
   ascend in the scales, they are found together lighter than vanity.
   [418] 10. Trust not in oppression and robbery, and be not vain: if
   riches increase, set not your heart upon them.


   7. In God is my salvation One expression is here heaped upon another
   and this apparently because he wished to rein that infirmity of
   disposition which makes us so prone to slide into wrong exercise. We
   may throw out a passing and occasional acknowledgement, that our only
   help is to be found in God, and yet shortly display our distrust in him
   by busying ourselves in all directions to supplement what we consider
   defective in his aid. The various terms which he employs to express the
   sufficiency of God as a deliverer, may thus be considered as so many
   arguments to constancy, or so many checks which he would apply to the
   waywardness of the carnal heart, ever disposed to depend for support
   upon others rather than God. Such is the manner in which he animates
   his own spirit; and next, we find him addressing himself to others,
   calling upon them to enter upon the same conflict, and reap the same
   victory and triumph. By the people, there seems little doubt that he
   means the Jews. The Gentiles being yet unvisited by the true religion
   and divine revelation, it was only in Judea that God could be the
   object of trust and religious invocation; and it would appear, that by
   distinguishing the chosen people of the Lord from the surrounding
   heathen, he insinuates how disgraceful it would be in them not to
   devote themselves entirely to God, being, as they were, the children of
   Abraham, favored with the discovery of his grace, and specially taken
   under his divine protection. The expression, at all times, means both
   in prosperity and adversity, intimating the blameworthiness of those
   who waver and succumb under every variation in their outward
   circumstances. God tries his children with afflictions, but here they
   are taught by David to abide them with constancy and courage. The
   hypocrites, who are loud in their praises of God so long as prosperity
   shines upon their head, while their heart fails them upon the first
   approach of trial, dishonor his name by placing a most injurious
   limitation to his power. We are bound to put honor upon his name by
   remembering, in our greatest extremities, that to Him belong the issues
   of death. And as we are all too apt at such times to shut up our
   affliction in our own breast -- a circumstance which can only aggravate
   the trouble and imbitter the mind against God, David could not have
   suggested a better expedient than that of disburdening our cares to
   him, and thus, as it were, pouring out our hearts before him. It is
   always found, that when the heart is pressed under a load of distress,
   there is no freedom in prayer. [419] Under trying circumstances, we
   must comfort ourselves by reflecting that God will extend relief,
   provided we just freely roll them over upon his consideration. What the
   Psalmist advises is all the more necessary, considering the mischievous
   tendency which we have naturally to keep our troubles pent up in our
   breasts till they drive us to despair. Usually, indeed, men show much
   anxiety and ingenuity in seeking to escape from the troubles which may
   happen to press upon them; but so long as they shun coming into the
   presence of God, they only involve themselves in a labyrinth of
   difficulties. Not to insist farther upon the words, David is here to be
   considered as exposing that diseased but deeply-rooted principle in our
   nature, which leads us to hide our griefs, and ruminate upon them,
   instead of relieving ourselves at once by pouring out our prayers and
   complaints before God. The consequence is, that we are distracted more
   and more with our distresses, and merge into a state of hopeless
   despondency. In the close of the verse, he says, in reference to the
   people generally, what he had said of himself individually, that their
   safety was to be found only under the divine protection.

   9. Nevertheless, the sons of Adam are vanity. If we take the particle
   'k, ach, affirmatively, as meaning surely or certainly, then this verse
   contains a confirmation of the truth expressed in the preceding verse;
   and David argues by contrast, [420] that as men are lighter than
   vanity, we are shut up to the necessity of placing all our expectation
   upon God. It would agree well, however, with the contrast to suppose,
   that, under an impression of the little effect which the truth he had
   announced was calculated to have upon the people, (ever disposed to
   build upon fallacious hopes,) he exclaims, with a degree of holy
   fervor, Nevertheless, etc. According to this view, he is here
   administering a reproof to the blind infidelity so prevalent amongst
   men, and which leads them to deceive themselves with lying vanities
   rather than trust in the infallible promises of Jehovah. Having had
   occasion to discover such a large amount of vanity in the chosen seed
   of Abraham, he does not scruple to speak of the whole human family in
   general as being abandoned to lying delusions. The adverb ychd, yachad,
   together, intimates that all, without exception, are ready to find an
   occasion of turning aside. Such is the sweeping condemnation passed,
   not upon a few individuals, but upon human nature, declaring men to be
   lighter than vanity; and may we not ask what in this case becomes of
   boasted reason, wisdom, and free-will? It is of no avail to object,
   that believers are delivered from the deceit which is here condemned.
   If they owe their exemption from lying and vanity to the regeneration
   of the Spirit, this is to grant that they were subject to these in
   their natural state. The first man was created by God upright, but drew
   us by his fall into such a depth of corruption, that any light which
   was originally bestowed has been totally obscured. Is it alleged that
   there still remain in man such gifts of God as are not to be despised,
   and as distinguish him from all the other creatures, this is easily
   answered, by remembering, that however great these may be, he is
   tainted by sin, and therefore nothing to be accounted of. It is only
   when allied with the knowledge of God that any of the endowments
   conferred upon us from above can be said to have a real excellency; --
   apart from this, they are vitiated by that contagion of sin which has
   not left a vestige in man of his original integrity. With too much
   justice, then, might David say that all men are vanity and nothingness.

   10 Trust not in oppression and robbery We are here taught that there
   can be no real trusting in God until we put away all those vain
   confidences which prove so many means of turning us away from him. The
   Psalmist bids us remove whatsoever would have this tendency, and purge
   ourselves of every vicious desire that would usurp the place of God in
   our hearts. One or two kinds of sin only are mentioned, but these are
   to be understood as representing a part for the whole, all those vain
   and rival confidences of which we must be divested before we can cleave
   to God with true purpose and sincerity of heart. By oppression and
   robbery may be understood the act itself of abstracting by violence,
   and the thing which has been abstracted. It is obviously the design of
   the passage to warn us against the presumption and hardihood of sin,
   which is so apt to blind the hearts of men, and deceive them into the
   belief that their evil courses are sanctioned by the impunity which is
   extended to them. Interpreters have differed in their construction of
   the words of this verse. Some join to each of the nouns its own verb,
   reading, Trust not in oppression, and be not vain in robbery: if riches
   increase, set not your heart upon them. [421] Others connect the words
   oppression and robbery with the first verb, and make the second to
   stand apart by itself in an indefinite sense. It is of very little
   consequence which of the constructions we adopt, since both express the
   main sentiment; and it is evident that the Psalmist, in condemning the
   infatuated confidence of those who boast in robbery, appropriately
   terms it a mere illusion of the mind, with which they deceive or amuse
   themselves. Having denounced, in the first place, those desires which
   are plainly evil and positively wicked, he proceeds immediately
   afterwards to guard against an inordinate attachment even to such
   riches as may have been honestly acquired. To set the heart upon
   riches, means more than simply to covet the possession of them. It
   implies being carried away by them into a false confidence, or, to use
   an expression of Paul, "Being high-minded." The admonition here given
   is one which daily observation teaches us to be necessary. It is
   uniformly seen that prosperity and abundance engender a haughty spirit,
   leading men at once to be presumptuous in their carriage before God,
   and reckless in inflicting injury upon their fellow-creatures. But,
   indeed, the worst effect to be feared from a blind and ungoverned
   spirit of this kind is, that, in the intoxication of outward greatness,
   we be left to forget how frail we are, and proudly and contumeliously
   to exalt ourselves against God.

   renders the phrase. "Adam," says he, "was the name of the first man
   when formed out of the earth: Ish was his name when united to his wife,
   and they became one flesh. Before, he was the incomplete man; after, he
   was the complete man." The phrases are rendered in our English version,

   unavailing it is to trust in man. If men of low degree and men of high
   degree are put both together in one scale, and vanity in the other, the
   scale of vanity will preponderate.

   Psalm 62:11-12

   11. God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this, that power belongeth
   unto God. 12. Also unto thee, O Lord: belongeth mercy; thou wilt
   certainly render to every man according to his work.


   11 God hath spoken once. The Psalmist considered that the only
   effectual method of abstracting the minds of men from the vain
   delusions in which they are disposed to trust, was bringing them to
   acquiesce implicitly and firmly in the judgment of God. Usually they
   are swayed in different directions, or inclined at least to waver, just
   as they observe things changing in the world; [422] but he brings under
   their notice a surer principle for the regulation of their conduct,
   when he recommends a deferential regard to God's Word. God himself
   "dwells in the light which is inaccessible," (1 Timothy 6:16;) and as
   none can come to him except by faith, the Psalmist calls our attention
   to his word, in which he testifies the truth of his divine and
   righteous government of the world. It is of great consequence that we
   be established in the belief of God's Word, and we are here directed to
   the unerring certainty which belongs to it. The passage admits of two
   interpretations; but the scope of it is plainly this, that God acts
   consistently with himself, and can never swerve from what he has said.
   Many understand David to say that God had spoken once and a second
   time; and that by this explicit and repeated assertion of his power and
   mercy, he had confirmed the truth beyond all possibility of
   contradiction. There is a passage much to the same effect in the
   thirty-third chapter of the book of Job, and fourteenth verse, where
   the same words are used, only the copulative is interposed. If any
   should prefer it, however, I have no objections to the other meaning --
   God has spoken once; twice have I heard this. It agrees with the
   context, and suggests a practical lesson of great importance; for when
   God has once issued his word he never retracts: on the other hand, it
   is our duty to ponder on what he has said, long and deliberately; and
   the meaning of David will then be, that he considered the Word of God
   in the light of a decree, steadfast and irreversible, but that, as
   regarded his exercise in reference to it, he meditated upon it again
   and again, lest the lapse of time might obliterate it from his memory.
   But the simpler and preferable reading would seem to be, that God had
   spoken once and again. There is no force in the ingenious conjecture,
   that allusion may be made to God's having spoken once in the Law, and a
   second time in the Prophets. Nothing more is meant than that the truth
   referred to had been amply confirmed, it being usual to reckon anything
   certain and fixed which has been repeatedly announced. Here, however,
   it must be remembered, that every word which may have issued forth from
   God is to be received with implicit authority, and no countenance given
   to the abominable practice of refusing to receive a doctrine, unless it
   can be supported by two or three texts of Scripture. This has been
   defended by an unprincipled heretic among ourselves, who has attempted
   to subvert the doctrine of a free election, and of a secret providence.
   It was not the intention of David to say that God was tied down to the
   necessity of repeating what he might choose to announce, but simply to
   assert the certainty of a truth which had been declared in clear and
   unambiguous terms. In the context which follows, he exemplifies himself
   that deferential reverence and regard for the word of God which all
   should, but which so few actually do, extend to it.

   We might just put together, in a connected form, the particular
   doctrines which he has singled out for special notice. It is
   essentially necessary, if we would fortify our minds against
   temptation, to have suitably exalted views of the power and mercy of
   God, since nothing will more effectually preserve us in a straight and
   undeviating course, than a firm persuasion that all events are in the
   hand of God, and that he is as merciful as he is mighty. Accordingly,
   David follows up what he had said on the subject of the deference to be
   yielded to the word, by declaring that he had been instructed by it in
   the power and goodness of God. Some understand him to say, that God is
   possessed of power to deliver his people, and of clemency imbuing him
   to exercise it. But he would rather appear to mean, that God is strong
   to put a restraint upon the wicked, and crush their proud and nefarious
   designs, but ever mindful of his goodness in protecting and defending
   his own children. The man who disciplines himself to the contemplation
   of these two attributes, which ought never to be dissociated in our
   minds from the idea of God, is certain to stand erect and immovable
   under the fiercest assaults of temptation; while, on the other hand, by
   losing sight of the all-sufficiency of God, (which we are too apt to
   do,) we lay ourselves open to be overwhelmed in the first encounter.
   The world's opinion of God is, that he sits in heaven an idle and
   unconcerned spectator of events which are passing. Need we wonder, that
   men tremble under every casualty, when they thus believe themselves to
   be the sport of blind chance? There can be no security felt unless we
   satisfy ourselves of the truth of a divine superintendence, and can
   commit our lives and all that we have to the hands of God. The first
   thing which we must look to is his power, that we may have a thorough
   conviction of his being a sure refuge to such as cast themselves upon
   his care. With this there must be conjoined confidence in his mercy, to
   prevent those anxious thoughts which might otherwise rise in our minds.
   These may suggest the doubt -- What though God govern the world? does
   it follow that he will concern himself about such unworthy objects as
   ourselves?

   There is an obvious reason, then, for the Psalmist coupling these two
   things together, his power and his clemency. They are the two wings
   wherewith we fly upwards to heaven; the two pillars on which we rest,
   and may defy the surges of temptation. Does danger, in short, spring up
   from any quarter, then just let us call to remembrance that divine
   power which can bid away all harms, and as this sentiment prevails in
   our minds, our troubles cannot fail to fall prostrate before it. Why
   should we fear -- how can we be afraid, when the God who covers us with
   the shadow of his wings, is the same who rules the universe with his
   nod, holds in secret chains the devil and all the wicked, and
   effectually overrules their designs and intrigues?

   The Psalmist adds, Thou wilt certainly render to every man according to
   his work. And here he brings what he said to bear still more closely
   upon the point which he would establish, declaring that the God who
   governs the world by his providence will judge it in righteousness. The
   expectation of this, duly cherished, will have a happy effect in
   composing our minds, allaying impatience, and checking any disposition
   to resent and retaliate under our injuries. In resting himself and
   others before the great bar of God, he would both encourage his heart
   in the hope of that deliverance which was coming, and teach himself to
   despise the insolent persecution of his enemies, when he considered
   that every man's work was to come into judgment before Him, who can no
   more cease to be Judge than deny himself. We can therefore rest
   assured, however severe our wrongs may be, though wicked men should
   account us the filth and the off-scourings of all things, that God is
   witness to what we suffer, will interpose in due time, and will not
   disappoint our patient expectation. From this, and passages of a
   similar kind, the Papists have argued, in defense of their doctrine,
   that justification and salvation depend upon good works; but I have
   already exposed the fallacy of their reasoning. No sooner is mention
   made of works, than they catch at the expression, as amounting to a
   statement that God rewards men upon the ground of merit. It is with a
   very different design than to encourage any such opinion, that the
   Spirit promises a reward to our works -- it is to animate us in the
   ways of obedience, and not to inflame that impious self-confidence
   which cuts up salvation by the very roots. According to the judgment
   which God forms of the works of the believer, their worth and valuation
   depend, first, upon the free pardon extended to him as a sinner, and by
   which he becomes reconciled to God; and, next, upon the divine
   condescension and indulgence which accepts his services, [423]
   notwithstanding all their imperfections. We know that there is none of
   our works which, in the sight of God, can be accounted perfect or pure,
   and without taint of sin. Any recompense they meet with must therefore
   be traced entirely to his goodness. Since the Scriptures promise a
   reward to the saints, with the sole intention of stimulating their
   minds, and encouraging them in the divine warfare, and not with the
   remotest design of derogating from the mercy of God, it is absurd in
   the Papists to allege that they, in any sense, merit what is bestowed
   upon them. As regards the wicked, none will dispute that the punishment
   awarded to them, as violators of the law, is strictly deserved.

   PSALM 63

   The following psalm cannot so properly be said to consist of prayers as
   of a variety of pious meditations, which comforted the mind of David
   under dangers, anxieties, and troubles of a severe description. It
   contains the vows too which he made to God in the distress occasioned
   by the alarming circumstances in which he was placed.

   A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. [424]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 63:1-4

   1. O God! thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul has thirsted
   for thee, my flesh has longed for thee in [425] a desert and thirsty
   [426] land, where no water is. 2. Thus have I beheld thee in the
   sanctuary, to see thy power and thy glory. 3. Because thy mercy is
   better than life, my lips shall praise thee. 4. Thus will I bless thee
   while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.


   1. O God! thou art my God. The wilderness of Judah, spoken of in the
   title, can be no other than that of Ziph, where David wandered so long
   in a state of concealment. We may rely upon the truth of the record he
   gives us of his exercise when under his trials; and it is apparent that
   he never allowed himself to be so far overcome by them, as to cease
   lifting up his prayers to heaven, and even resting, with a firm and
   constant faith, upon the divine promises. Apt as we are, when assaulted
   by the very slightest trials, to lose the comfort of any knowledge of
   God we may previously have possessed, it is necessary that we should
   notice this, and learn, by his example, to struggle to maintain our
   confidence under the worst troubles that can befall us. He does more
   than simply pray; he sets the Lord before him as his God, that he may
   throw all his cares unhesitatingly upon him, deserted as he was of man,
   and a poor outcast in the waste and howling wilderness. His faith,
   shown in this persuasion of the favor and help of God, had the effect
   of exciting him to constant and vehement prayer for the grace which he
   expected. In saying that his soul thirsted, and his flesh longed, he
   alludes to the destitution and poverty which he lay under in the
   wilderness, and intimates, that though deprived of the ordinary means
   of subsistence, he looked to God as his meat and his drink, directing
   all his desires to him. When he represents his soul as thirsting, and
   his flesh as hungering, we are not to seek for any nice or subtile
   design in the distinction. He means simply that he desired God, both
   with soul and body. For although the body, strictly speaking, is not of
   itself influenced by desire, we know that the feelings of the soul
   intimately and extensively affect it.

   2. Thus in the sanctuary, etc. It is apparent, as already hinted, that
   God was ever in his thoughts, though wandering in the wilderness under
   such circumstances of destitution. The particle thus is emphatic. Even
   when so situated, in a wild and hideous solitude, where the very
   horrors of the place were enough to have distracted his meditations, he
   exercised himself in beholding the power and glory of God, just as if
   he had been in the sanctuary. Formerly, when it was in his power to
   wait upon the tabernacle, he was far from neglecting that part of the
   instituted worship of God. He was well aware that he needed such helps
   to devotion. But now, when shut out, in the providence of God, from any
   such privilege, he shows, by the delight which he took in spiritual
   views of God, that his was not a mind engrossed with the symbols, or
   mere outward ceremonial of religion. He gives evidence how much he had
   profited by the devotional exercises enjoined under that dispensation.
   It is noticeable of ignorant and superstitious persons, that they seem
   full of zeal and fervor so long as they come in contact with the
   ceremonies of religion, while their seriousness evaporates immediately
   upon these being withdrawn. David, on the contrary, when these were
   removed, continued to retain them in his recollection, and rise,
   through their assistance, to fervent aspirations after God. We may
   learn by this, when deprived at any time of the outward means of grace,
   to direct the eye of our faith to God in the worst circumstances, and
   not to forget him whenever the symbols of holy things are taken out of
   our sight. The great truth, for example, of our spiritual regeneration,
   though but once represented to us in baptism, should remain fixed in
   our minds through our whole life, [427] (Titus 3:5; Ephesians 5:26.)
   The mystical union subsisting between Christ and his members should be
   matter of reflection, not only when we sit at the Lord's table, but at
   all other times. Or suppose that the Lord's Supper, and other means of
   advancing our spiritual welfare, were taken from us by an exercise of
   tyrannical power, it does not follow that our minds should ever cease
   to be occupied with the contemplation of God. The expression, So have I
   beheld thee to see, etc., indicates the earnestness with which he was
   intent upon the object, directing his whole meditation to this, that he
   might see the power and glory of God, of which there was a reflection
   in the sanctuary.

   3 Because thy mercy is better than life, etc. I have no objections to
   read the verse in this connected form, though I think that the first
   clause would be better separated, and taken in with the verse
   preceding. David would appear to be giving the reason of his
   earnestness in desiring God. By life is to be understood, in general,
   everything which men use for their own maintenance and defense. When we
   think ourselves well provided otherwise, we feel no disposition to have
   recourse to the mercy of God. That being (to speak so) which we have of
   our own, prevents us from seeing that we live through the mere grace of
   God. [428] As we are too much disposed to trust in aids of a carnal
   kind, and to forget God, the Psalmist here affirms that we should have
   more reliance upon the divine mercy in the midst of death, than upon
   what we are disposed to call, or what may appear to be, life. Another
   interpretation has been given of the words of this verse, but a very
   meagre and feeble one, -- That the mercy of God is better than life
   itself; or, in other words, that the divine favor is preferable to
   every other possession. But the opposition is evidently between that
   state of secure prosperity, in which men are so apt to rest with
   complacency, and the mercy of God, which is the stay of such as are
   ready to sink and perish, and which is the one effectual remedy for
   supplying (if one might use that expression) all defects.

   The word which I have rendered life, being in the plural number in the
   Hebrew, has led Augustine to assign a meaning to the sentence which is
   philosophical and ingenious, but without foundation, as the plural of
   the word is quite commonly used in the singular signification. He
   considered that the term lives was here used in reference to the truth,
   That different men affect different modes of life, some seeking riches,
   and others pleasure; some desiring the luxuries, and some the honors of
   this world, while others are given to their sensual appetites. He
   conceived that there was an opposition stated in the verse between
   these various kinds of life and eternal life, here by a common figure
   of speech called mercy, because it is of grace, and not of merit. But
   it is much more natural to understand the Psalmist as meaning, that it
   was of no consequence how large a share men possess of prosperity, and
   of the means which are generally thought to make life secure, the
   divine mercy being a better foundation of trust than any life fashioned
   out to ourselves, and than all other supports taken together. [429] On
   this account the Lord's people, however severely they may suffer from
   poverty, or the violence of human wrongs, or the languor of desire, or
   hunger and thirst, or the many troubles and anxieties of life, may be
   happy notwithstanding; for it is well with them, in the best sense of
   the term, when God is their friend. Unbelievers, on the other hand,
   must be miserable, even when all the world smiles upon them; for God is
   their enemy, and a curse necessarily attaches to their lot.

   In the words which follow, David expresses his consequent resolution to
   praise God. When we experience his goodness, we are led to open our
   lips in thanksgiving. His intention is intimated still more clearly in
   the succeeding verse, where he says that he will bless God in his life
   There is some difficulty, however, in ascertaining the exact sense of
   the words. When it is said, So will I bless thee, etc., the so may
   refer to the good reason which he had, as just stated, to praise God,
   from having felt how much better it is to live by life communicated
   from God, than to live of and from ourselves. [430] Or the sense may
   be, so, that is, even in this calamitous and afflicted condition: for
   he had already intimated that, amidst the solitude of the wilderness,
   where he wandered, he would still direct his eye to God. The word life,
   again, may refer to his life as having been preserved by divine
   interposition; or the sense of the passage may be, that he would bless
   God through the course of his life. The former meaning conveys the
   fullest matter of instruction, and agrees with the context; he would
   bless God, because, by his goodness, he had been kept alive and in
   safety. The sentiment is similar to that which we find elsewhere,

   "I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord;" --
   (Psalm 118:17)

   and again; --

   "The dead shall not praise the Lord, neither any that go down into
   silence, but we who live will bless the Lord,"
   (Psalm 115:17, 18.)

   In the lifting up of hands, [431] in the second clause of the verse,
   allusion is made to praying and vowing; and he intimates, that besides
   giving thanks to God, he would acquire additional confidence in
   supplication, and be diligent in the exercise of it. Any experience we
   may have of the divine goodness, while it stirs us up to gratitude,
   should, at the same time, strengthen our hopes of the future, and lead
   us confidently to expect that God will perfect the grace which he has
   begun. Some understand by the lifting up of his hands, that he refers
   to praising the Lord. Others, that he speaks of encouraging himself
   from the divine assistance, and boldly encountering his enemies. But I
   prefer the interpretation which has been already given.

   in the classical writers. Parkhurst, considering the hand' to be the
   chief organ or instrument of man's power and operations, and properly
   supposing the word to be thence used very extensively by the Hebrews
   for power, agency, dominion, assistance, and the like, regards the
   lifting up of men's hands in prayer as an emblematical acknowledging of
   the power, and imploring of the assistance of their respective gods. Is
   it not, however, rather the natural and unstudied gesture of earnest
   supplication?" -- Mant.

   Psalm 63:5-8

   5. My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth
   shall praise thee with joyful lips. 6. I shall surely [432] remember
   thee upon my couch: I will meditate upon thee in the night watches,
   [433] 7. Because thou hast been my help: and I will rejoice in the
   shadow of thy wings. 8. My soul has cleaved hard after thee: thy right
   hand will uphold me.


   5. My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow, etc. In accordance with
   what was said in the foregoing verse, David expresses his assured
   persuasion of obtaining a rich and abundant measure of every blessing
   that could call for thanksgiving and praise. At the period of composing
   this psalm, he may have been already in the enjoyment of ease and
   plenty; but there is reason to believe that he cherished the persuasion
   referred to, even when wandering in the wilderness in a state of
   poverty and destitution. If we would evidence a strong faith, we must
   anticipate the divine favor before it has been actually manifested, and
   when there is no present appearance of its forthcoming. From the
   instance here set before us, we must learn to be on our guard against
   despondency, in circumstances when we may see the wicked wallowing and
   rioting in the abundance of the things of this world, while we
   ourselves are left to pine under the want of them. David, in the
   present pressure to which he was exposed, might have given way to
   despair, but he knew that God was able to fill the hungry soul, and
   that he could want for nothing so long as he possessed an interest in
   his favor. It is God's will to try our patience in this life, by
   afflictions of various kinds. Let us bear the wrongs which may be done
   us with meekness, till the time come when all our desires shall be
   abundantly satisfied. It may be proper to observe, that David, when he
   speaks in figurative language of being filled with marrow and fatness,
   does not contemplate that intemperate and excessive indulgence to which
   ungodly men surrender themselves, and by which they brutify their
   minds. He looks forward to that moderate measure of enjoyment which
   would only quicken him to more alacrity in the praises of God.

   6 I shall surely remember thee, etc. It may be read also, when, or, as
   often as I remember thee, I will pray in the night watches. But as the
   Hebrew particle here used is occasionally taken for an adverb of
   affirmation, as well as of time, I have adhered to the commonly
   received translation, In this case, his remembering God is to be
   understood as the same thing with his meditating upon him; and the one
   clause contains just a repetition of the sentiment expressed in the
   other. If the particle be taken in the different sense formerly
   mentioned, the words intimate, that as often as the name of God
   recurred to his mind, he would dwell upon it with pleasure, and speak
   of his goodness. He particularly mentions the night watches, as, when
   retired from the sight of our fellow-creatures, we not only revert to
   what may have given us anxiety, but feel our thoughts drawn out more
   freely to different subjects. We have next the reason assigned for the
   engagement or declaration he has just made, which is, that he owed to
   God his preservation. The experience of the divine goodness should
   dispose us to prayer as well as praise. "I will come into thy house,"
   says the Psalmist in another place, "in the multitude of thy mercy,"
   (Psalm 5:7.) The second part of the seventh verse is expressive of the
   lively hope with which he was animated. He was resolved to rejoice and
   triumph under the shadow of God's wings, as feeling the same peace and
   satisfaction in reliance upon his protection as he could have done had
   no danger existed.

   8 My soul has cleaved hard after thee The Hebrew verb means also to
   apprehend, or follow, especially when in construction with the
   preposition which is here joined to it, and therefore we might very
   properly render the words, -- My soul shall press or follow after thee.
   [434] But even should the other translation be retained, the sense is,
   that David's heart was devoted to God with steadfast perseverance. The
   phrase, after thee, is emphatical, and denotes that he would follow
   with unwearied constancy, long as the way might be, and full of
   hardships, and beset with obstacles, and however sovereignly God might
   himself seem to withdraw his presence. The latter clause of the verse
   may be taken as referring simply to the deliverance which he had
   previously mentioned as having been received. He had good reason to
   persevere, without fainting, in following after God, when he considered
   that he had been preserved in safety, up to this time, by the divine
   hand. But I would understand the words as having a more extensive
   application, and consider that David here speaks of the grace of
   perseverance, which would be bestowed upon him by the Spirit. To say
   that he would cleave to God, with an unwavering purpose, at all
   hazards, might have sounded like the language of vain boasting, had he
   not qualified the assertion by adding, that he would do this in so far
   as he was sustained by the hand of God.

   [432] "Ou, quand," etc. -- Fr. marg. "Or, when I shall remember thee."

   [433] Among the Hebrews the night was divided into portions of three or
   four hours each, which were denominated vigils or watches.

   [434] Dr Adam Clarke renders, "My soul cleaves, or is glued after
   thee." "This phrase," says he, "not only shows the diligence of the
   pursuit, and the nearness of the attainment, but also the fast hold he
   had got of the mercy of his God."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 63:9-11

   9. And they, whilst they seek my soul to destroy it, shall go into the
   lowest parts of the earth. 10. They shall cast him out [435] to the
   edge of the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes. 11. But the king
   [436] , shall rejoice in God; and every one who swears by him shall
   glory: for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.


   9. And they, whilst they seek, etc. Here we find David rising to a more
   assured confidence, and triumphing as if he had already obtained the
   victory. And there is every reason to believe, that though he had
   escaped his difficulties, and was in circumstances of peace and
   prosperity when he wrote this psalm, yet he only expresses what he
   actually felt at the critical period when his life was in such imminent
   danger. He declares his conviction that the enemies who eagerly sought
   his life would be cut off; that God would cast them headlong into
   destruction; and that their very bodies should be left without burial.
   To be the portion of foxes, [437] is the same thing with being left to
   be torn and devoured by the beasts of the field. It is often denounced
   as one judgment which should befall the wicked, that they would perish
   by the sword, and become the prey of wolves and of dogs, without
   privilege of sepulture. This is a fate which the best of men have met
   with in the world, -- for good as well as bad are exposed to the stroke
   of temporal evil; -- but there is this distinction, that God watches
   over the scattered dust of his own children, gathers it again, and will
   suffer nothing of them to perish, whereas, when the wicked are slain,
   and their bones spread on the field, this is only preparatory to their
   everlasting destruction.

   11. But the king will rejoice in God. The deliverance which David
   received had not been extended to him as a private person, but the
   welfare of the whole Church was concerned in it, as that of the body in
   the safety of the head, and there is therefore a propriety in his
   representing all the people of God as rejoicing with him. Nor can we
   fail to admire his holy magnanimity in not scrupling to call himself
   king, overwhelming as the dangers were by which he was surrounded,
   because he laid claim to that honor by faith, though yet denied him in
   actual possession. In saying that he would rejoice in God, he refers to
   the gratitude which he would feel; at the same time, in extolling the
   divine goodness shown to him, he views it as it affected the common
   body of the faithful. [438] As was already remarked, the safety of
   God's chosen people, at that time, was inseparably connected with the
   reign of David and its prosperity -- a figure by which it was the
   divine intention to teach us, that our happiness and glory depend
   entirely upon Christ. By those who swear in the name of the Lord, he
   means in general all his genuine servants. The act of solemnly calling
   upon God to witness and judge what we say, is one part of divine
   worship: hence an oath, by the figure of speech called synecdoche, is
   made to signify the profession of religion in general. We are not to
   imagine from this that God reckons all those to be his servants who
   make mention of his name. Many take it into their lips only to profane
   it by the grossest perjury; others outrage or slight it by entering
   into trifling and unnecessary oaths; and hypocrites are chargeable with
   wickedly abusing it. But those whom David refers to are such as swear
   by the Lord, considerately and with reverence, and whose hearts respond
   to what they declare. This appears more clearly from the contrast which
   follows in the verse, where he opposes those who swear by the name of
   God to those who speak lies, understanding by that term, not only
   treacherous and deceitful men, but men who profane the name of God by
   falsehoods of a sacrilegious kind.

   [435] "ygyrhv," here rendered, they shall cast him out, "from ngr,
   signifies in Hiphil, they shall cause to be poured out, or shall pour
   out The word is ordinarily applied to water, 2 Samuel 14:14;
   Lamentations 3:49. But here, by the immediate mention of the sword, it
   is restrained to the effusion of blood; and being in the third person
   plural, in the active sense, it is, after the Hebrew idiom, to be
   interpreted in the passive sense, They shall pour out by the hand of
   the sword;' i e. They shall be poured out by the sword,' the hand of
   the sword being no more than the edge of the sword." -- Hammond Dr Adam
   Clarke gives the same version: "They shall be poured out by the hand of
   the sword Heb. That is, their life's blood shall be shed either in war,
   or by the hand of justice." But ngr, nagar, also signifies
   metaphorically to give over into one's hands, to give up, as in the
   phrase, hgyr l yry chrv, "to deliver any one up to the sword." See
   Ezekiel 35:5; Jeremiah 18:21. And the Septuagint, Syriac, Vulgate,
   Aethiopic, and Arabic versions, Gesenius and Hare here read, "They
   shall be delivered to the sword." Horsley translates, "They would shed
   it;" and observes, that it signifies "my life; for nphs, which is of
   the doubtful gender, is the antecedent of the masculine suffix hv."

   Ainsworth.

   [437] Under the Hebrew word svl, shual, here rendered fox, was
   comprehended, in common language, the jackal, or Vulpes aureus, golden
   wolf, so called in Latin because its color is a bright yellow; and in
   this sense svl, shual, has been generally interpreted here, because the
   jackal is found in Palestine, and feeds on carrion. Both of these
   circumstances are, however, also applicable to the fox, and, moreover,
   Bochart has made it probable that the specific name of the jackal (the
   thos of the Greeks) in Hebrew was 'y, aye, the howler, being so called
   from the howling cry which he makes particularly at night. The term
   occurs in Isaiah 13:22; 34:14; and Jeremiah 50:39; where 'yym, ayim, is
   rendered, in our version, "the wild beasts of the islands," an
   appellation very vague and indeterminate. At the same time, it is
   highly probable that shual generally refers to the jackal. Several of
   the modern oriental names of this animal, as the Turkish chical, and
   the Persian sciagal, sciachal, or schachal -- whence the English jackal
   -- from their resemblance to the Hebrew word shual, favor this
   supposition; and Dr Shaw, and other travelers, inform us, that while
   jackals are very numerous in Palestine, the common fox is rarely to be
   met with. We shall, therefore, be more correct, under these
   circumstances, in admitting that the jackal of the East is the Hebrew
   shual These animals never go alone, but always associate in packs of
   from fifty to two hundred. They are known to prey on dead bodies; and
   so greedy are they of human carcases, that they dig them out of their
   graves, and devour them, however putrescent They have been seen waiting
   near the grave at the time of a funeral eagerly watching their
   opportunity of digging up the body almost as soon as it was buried. "I
   have known several instances," says a traveler quoted by Merrick, "of
   their attacking and devouring drunken men, whom they have found lying
   on the road, and have heard that they will do the same to men that are
   sick and helpless. I have seen many graves that have been opened by the
   jackals, and parts of the bodies pulled out by them." They visit the
   field of battle to prey upon the dying and the dead, and they follow
   caravans for the same purpose. It is usual with the barbarous nations
   of the East to leave the bodies of their enemies, killed in battle, in
   the field, to be devoured by jackals and other animals. When the
   Psalmist, therefore, says that his enemies would become a portion for
   foxes, the meaning is, that they would be denied the rites of
   sepulture, which was deemed a great calamity, -- that they should be
   left unburied, for jackals and other wild beasts to prey upon and
   devour.

   [424] David was often compelled to flee into the remote deserts which
   lay in the tribe of Judah, to escape the fury of Saul. In tracing his
   steps, when eagerly sought after by this relentless persecutor, we find
   him in the forest of Hareth, and in the wildernesses of Ziph, Maon, and
   Engedi, all in the tribe of Judah. See 1 Samuel 22:5; 23:14, 24, 25;
   24:1; and Joshua 15:55, 62. The only objection which can be made to
   referring the occasion of the composition of this psalm to David's
   persecution by Saul is, that in the 11th verse, David is called king;
   whereas Saul still swayed the scepter over Israel. But, as Calvin
   observes on that verse, David may have called himself by this title to
   express his confident persuasion that God would raise him to the throne
   in fulfillment of his promise; and his followers might call him king
   even during Saul's lifetime, though he was not acknowledged to be
   sovereign by any tribe till after Saul fell at Gilboa. It is, however,
   supposed by some that the psalm was written during the rebellion of his
   son Absalom, when he was under the necessity of quitting Jerusalem, and
   escaping into the wilderness, 2 Samuel 15:23; 16:2; and 17:29.

   PSALM 64

   This psalm expresses the language of complaint and prayer. David, in
   order that he may incline God to compassionate his case, dwells upon
   the injustice and cruelty, the intrigues and deceitfulness of his
   enemies. At the close, his eyes are directed to God, in the
   anticipation of a joyful deliverance from their hands.

   To the chief musician. A Psalm of David.

   Psalm 64:1-6

   1. Hear my voice, O God: in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of
   the enemy. 2. Hide me from the counsel of the wicked; from the assembly
   of the workers of iniquity. 3. For they have whetted their tongue like
   a sword; they have directed [or aimed [439] ] for their arrow a bitter
   word, [or report.] 4. To shoot in secret at the perfect; suddenly will
   they shoot, and not fear. 5. They assure themselves in an evil work,
   they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them? 6.
   They have searched out iniquities, they have accomplished a diligent
   search, [lit. a search searched out,] both the inward part of each of
   them, and the heart, is deep.


   1. Hear my voice, O God! He begins by saying that he prayed earnestly,
   and with vehemence, stating, at the same time, what rendered this
   necessary. The voice is heard in prayer, proportionally to the
   earnestness and ardor which we feel. He condescends upon the
   circumstances of distress in which he was presently placed, and takes
   notice of the dangers to which his life was exposed from enemies, with
   other points fitted to excite the favorable consideration of God. His
   praying that God would protect his life, proves that it must have been
   in danger at this time. In the second verse, he intimates that his
   enemies were numerous; and that, without divine assistance, he would be
   unable to sustain their attacks. Some difficulty attaches to the words,
   from their being susceptible of two meanings. The Hebrew term svd, sod,
   which signifies a secret, is understood by some to refer here to the
   secret plots of the wicked, and by others, to denote their meeting
   together for consultation. In translating it, I have employed a word
   which admits of either interpretation. The term rgst, rigshath, used in
   the second part of the verse, may also be rendered in two ways, as
   meaning either an assembly of men, or noise and uproar. It comes from
   rgs, ragash, a root signifying to make a tumult. This would suggest
   that the word svd, sod, in the former clause, might refer to the
   clandestine plots of the wicked, and rgst, rigshath, in the latter, to
   their open violence; and that David prayed to be protected, on the one
   hand, from the malicious purposes of his enemies, and, on the other,
   from the forcible measures by which they proceeded to put them into
   execution. But the meaning first given, and which I have adopted, seems
   the most simple and natural, That he solicits the compassion of God, by
   complaining of the number that were banded against him. Still his
   language implies that he looked upon the protection of heaven as amply
   sufficient against the greatest combination of adversaries. I may add,
   that there is an implied plea for strengthening his cause in prayer, in
   what he says of the malice and wickedness of those who were opposed to
   him; for the more cruel and unjust the conduct of our enemies may be,
   we have proportionally the better ground to believe that God will
   interpose in our behalf.

   3 For they have whetted their tongue like a sword His enemies, in their
   rage, aimed at nothing less than his life, and yet what he complains
   of, more than all beside, is the poison with which their words were
   imbued. It is probable that he refers to the calumnious reports which
   he knew to be falsely spread to his discredit, and with a view of
   damaging his reputation with the people. Their tongues he likens to
   swords; their bitter and venomous words to arrows. [440] And when he
   adds, that, they shoot against the upright and innocent, he is to be
   considered as contrasting his integrity with their unprincipled
   conduct. It inspired him with confidence in his religious addresses, to
   know that he could exonerate his own conscience from guilt, and that he
   was the object of undeserved attack by worthless and abandoned men. In
   mentioning that they shoot secretly and suddenly, he refers to the
   craft which characterised them. They were not only eagerly bent upon
   mischief, and intent in watching their opportunities, but so expert and
   quick in their movements, as to smite their victim before he could
   suspect danger. When we hear that David, who was a man in every respect
   so much more holy and upright in his conduct than ourselves, suffered
   from groundless aspersions upon his character, we have no reason to be
   surprised that we should be exposed to a similar trial. This comfort,
   at least, we always have, that we can betake ourselves to God, and
   obtain his defense of the upright cause. He takes particular notice of
   another circumstance, that they shot their empoisoned arrows from their
   lips without fear, or shame. This self-secure spirit argued a degree of
   abandoned presumption, in so far as they could persist in obstinately
   pursuing the conduct in which they had been repeatedly detected, and
   renew their desperate attempts, to the disregard of all fear of God or
   worldly shame.

   5 They assure themselves in an evil work. He proceeds to complain of
   the perverse determination with which they pursued their wickedness,
   and of their combinations amongst themselves; remarking, at the same
   time, upon the confidence with which they stirred one another up to the
   most daring acts of iniquity. In this there can be little doubt that
   they were encouraged by the present state of weakness to which David
   was reduced in his circumstances, taking occasion, when they found him
   in poverty and exile, and without means of resistance, to persecute him
   with the greater freedom. Having adverted to them as being beyond hope
   of amendment, and incapable of any impressions of humanity, he speaks
   of their meeting together to plot his destruction; and, in connection
   with this, of the unbounded confidence which they were led to display,
   from a belief that their designs were not seen. It is well known that
   one circumstance which strengthens the false security of the wicked,
   and encourages them to triumph in their crafty policy towards the
   simple and upright in heart, is their thinking that they can cover
   their crimes by such pretexts as they have always at hand. They say,
   Who shall see them? The word lmv, lamo, them, may refer either to the
   workers of iniquity themselves, or to the snares spoken of in the
   preceding clause. The first seems the preferable meaning. They run
   recklessly, and without restraint, in the ways of sin, blinded by their
   pride, and influenced neither by the fear of God nor a sense of shame.

   In the verse which follows, he animadverts severely upon the deceit
   which they practiced. He speaks of their having exhausted all the arts
   of mischief, so as to have left nothing in this department to be
   discovered. The search referred to has relation to the secret methods
   of doing evil. He adds, that their malice was deep. By the inward part
   and the heart, which was deep, he means the hidden devices to which the
   wicked have recourse for concealment. Some, instead of translating the
   words, the inward part of each, etc., give a more indefinite sense to
   'ys, ish, and read, the inward part, and deep heart, of every one, is
   found in them; that is, his enemies contrived to comprise in themselves
   all that men have ever displayed in the shape of craft and subtilty.
   Either rendering may be adopted; for it is evidently David's meaning
   that his enemies practiced secret stratagem as well as open violence,
   to compass his ruin, and showed themselves to be possessed of the
   deepest penetration in discovering dark and unimagined methods of doing
   mischief.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [439] The original word drk, darach, signifies to go, to send out,
   direct, and is used in different senses, according to the objects to
   which it is applied. "But most especially it is used of a bow or
   arrows. If of qst, a bow, then it is to bend it; if of chtsym, arrows,
   then it is not so properly to shoot as to prepare, or direct them. So
   Psalm 58:7, He directeth or prepareth his arrows;' so here, they
   direct, or aim, or make ready their arrows.' Parallel to which is that
   of Jeremiah 9:3, where being applied to the tongue, as to a bow that
   shoots out lying words, as arrows, it must be rendered bend; but here
   applied to words as arrows, direct, and not bend." -- Hammond

   [440] They have directed for their arrow a bitter word There may be, in
   these words, an allusion to the practice of fixing letters on arrows,
   and shooting or directing them where it was designed they should fall
   and be taken up. Thus the Jews say, Shebna and Joab sent letters to
   Sennacherib, acquainting him that all Israel were willing to make peace
   with him; but Hezekiah would not suffer them. Timoxenus and Artabazus
   sent letters to one another in this way at the siege of Potidaea. See
   Gill, in loco The word which they are said to direct as their arrow is
   called mr, mar, bitter, and this probably contains an allusion to
   poisoned arrows. The Chaldee paraphrast has "bending the bow and
   anointing the arrows," plainly intimating a conviction that such an
   allusion is implied. Poisoned arrows appear, from Job 6:4, to have been
   of very ancient use in Arabia. They were also used by many other
   nations in different parts of the world. Homer says of Ulysses, that he
   went to Ephyre, a city of Thessaly, in order to procure deadly poison
   for smearing his deadly-pointed arrows, Odyssey, Lib. 1, 50, 335-345.
   Virgil describes one of his heroes as eminently skillful in anointing
   the dart, and arming its steel with poison, Aen. Lib. 9, 50, 771. And
   Horace mentions the venenatoe sagittoe, the poisoned arrows of the
   ancient Moors in Africa, Lib. 1, Ode 22, 50, 3. Wherever this practice
   has prevailed, the poison employed has been of the most deadly kind,
   the slightest wound being followed by certain and almost instant death.
   This makes the language here strikingly expressive. David compares the
   calumnies his enemies launched against him to poisoned arrows.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 64:7-10

   7. And God shall shoot an arrow at them; suddenly shall they be
   wounded. 8. And they shall make their own tongue to fall upon
   themselves: and all that see them shall flee away. [441] 9. And all men
   shall see, and shall declare the work of God, and shall understand
   [442] what he hath done. 10. The righteous shall be glad in Jehovah,
   and shall hope in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.


   7 And God shall shoot an arrow at them The Psalmist now congratulates
   himself in the confident persuasion that his prayers have not been
   without effect, but already answered. Though there was no appearance of
   God's approaching judgment, he declares that it would suddenly be
   executed; and in this he affords a remarkable proof of his faith. He
   saw the wicked hardening themselves in their prosperity, and presuming
   upon impunity from the divine connivance and forbearance; but instead
   of yielding to discouragement, he was borne up by the belief that God,
   according to his usual mode of procedure with the wicked, would visit
   them at an unexpected moment, when they were flattering themselves with
   having escaped, and indulging in extravagant confidence. It is a
   consideration which should comfort us, when subjected to long-continued
   trial, that God, in delaying to punish the ungodly, does so with the
   express design of afterwards inflicting judgments of a more condign
   description upon them, and when they shall say, "Peace and safety,"
   overwhelming them with sudden destruction, (Jeremiah 8:11 [443] )

   8 And they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves Pursuing
   the same subject, he remarks, that the poison concocted in their secret
   counsels, and which they revealed with their tongues, would prove to
   have a deadly effect upon themselves. The sentiment is the same with
   that expressed elsewhere by another figure, when they are said to be
   caught in their own snares, and to fall into the pit which they have
   digged themselves, (Psalm 57:6.) It is just that Heaven should make the
   mischiefs which they had devised against innocent and upright men to
   recoil upon their own heads. The judgment is one which we see
   repeatedly and daily exemplified before our eyes, and yet we find much
   difficulty in believing that it can take place. We should feel
   ourselves bound the more to impress the truth upon our hearts, that God
   is ever watching, as it were, his opportunity of converting the
   stratagems of the wicked into means just as completely effective of
   their destruction, as if they had intentionally employed them for that
   end. In the close of the verse, to point out the striking severity of
   their punishment, it is said that all who saw them should flee away The
   judgments of God are lifted above out of the sight of an ignorant
   world, and ere it can be roused to fear and dismay, these must be such
   as to bear signal marks indeed of a divine hand.

   9 And all men shall see, and shall declare the work of God. He insists
   more fully upon the good effects which would result from the judgment
   executed in leading such as had formerly overlooked a Divine Providence
   altogether, to catch a spirit of inquiry from the singularity of the
   spectacle; and acquaint themselves with, and speak one to another of a
   subject hitherto entirely new to them. He intimates, that the knowledge
   of what God had so signally wrought would extend far and wide -- for he
   says, all men, etc. The Hebrew verb skl, shachal, employed, admits
   either of the neuter signification, they shall understand, or of the
   active, they shall cause others to understand. But as it is usual with
   David to repeat the same thing twice, perhaps the latter or transitive
   sense is preferable. Another desirable consequence which would flow
   from the deliverance granted is mentioned in the last verse, that it
   would afford matter of joy, hope, and holy triumph to the saints, who
   would be confirmed in expecting the same help from God which he had
   extended to his servant David. Those formerly called the righteous are
   now styled the upright in heart, to teach us, that the only
   righteousness which proves acceptable is that which proceeds from
   inward sincerity. This truth I have insisted upon at large elsewhere.

   PSALM 65

   This psalm is composed both of petition and thanksgiving. It contains a
   prediction of the Gentiles being called to the common faith, but is
   principally occupied with praising God for the fatherly care which he
   exercises over his Church, and the benefits which flow from it. The
   Psalmist prays particularly that God would continue his former kindness
   to the Jewish people. Two instances of the Divine goodness are
   specified, -- the powerful defense extended to their land, and the
   enriching of it with so many blessings.

   To the chief musician, a Psalm of David. [444]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 65:1-3

   1. Praise waiteth [445] for thee, O Lord! in Zion; and unto thee shall
   the vow be performed. 2. O thou that hearest prayer! unto thee shall
   all flesh come. 3. Words of iniquity have prevailed against me: our
   transgressions thou shalt purge them away. [446]


   1 Praise waiteth for thee, O God! in Zion Literally it runs, Praise is
   silent to thee, but the verb dmyh, dumiyah, has been metaphorically
   rendered first, to be at rest, then to wait. The meaning of the
   expression is, that God's goodness to his people is such as to afford
   constantly new matter of praise. It is diffused over the whole world,
   but specially shown to the Church. Besides, others who do not belong to
   the Church of God, however abundantly benefits may be showered upon
   them, see not whence they come, and riot in the blessings which they
   have received without any acknowledgement of them. But the main thing
   meant to be conveyed by the Psalmist is, that thanksgiving is due to
   the Lord for his goodness shown to his Church and people. The second
   clause of the verse is to the same effect, where he says, unto thee
   shall the vow be performed; for while he engages on the part of the
   people to render due acknowledgement, his language implies that there
   would be ever remaining and new grounds of praise.

   With the verse which we have been now considering, that which follows
   stands closely connected, asserting that God hears the prayers of his
   people. This forms a reason why the vow should be paid to him, since
   God never disappoints his worshippers, but crowns their prayers with a
   favorable answer. Thus, what is stated last, is first in the natural
   order of consideration. The title here given to God carries with it a
   truth of great importance, That the answer of our prayers is secured by
   the fact, that in rejecting them he would in a certain sense deny his
   own nature. The Psalmist does not say, that God has heard prayer in
   this or that instance, but gives him the name of the hearer of prayer,
   as what constitutes an abiding part of his glory, so that he might as
   soon deny himself as shut his ear to our petitions. Could we only
   impress this upon our minds, that it is something peculiar to God, and
   inseparable from him, to hear prayer, it would inspire us with
   unfailing confidence. The power of helping us he can never want, so
   that nothing can stand in the way of a successful issue of our
   supplications. What follows in the verse is also well worthy of our
   attention, that all flesh shall come unto God. None could venture into
   his presence without a persuasion of his being open to entreaty; but
   when he anticipates our fears, and comes forward declaring that prayer
   is never offered to him in vain, the door is thrown wide for the
   admission of all. The hypocrite and the ungodly, who pray under the
   constraint of present necessity, are not heard; for they cannot be said
   to come to God, when they have no faith founded upon his word, but a
   mere vague expectation of a chance issue. Before we can approach God
   acceptably in prayer, it is necessary that his promises should be made
   known to us, without which we can have no access to him, as is evident
   from the words of the apostle Paul, (Ephesians 3:12,) where he tells
   us, that all who would come to God must first be endued with such a
   faith in Christ as may animate them wig confidence. From this we may
   infer, that no right rule of prayer is observed in the Papacy, when
   they pray to God in a state of suspense and doubt. Invaluable is the
   privilege which we enjoy by the Gospel, of free access unto God. When
   the Psalmist uses the expression, all flesh, he intimates by these few
   words that the privilege which was now peculiar to the Jews, would be
   extended to all nations. It is a prediction of Christ's future kingdom.

   3 Words of iniquity have prevailed against me [447] He does not
   complain of the people being assailed with calumny, but is to be
   understood as confessing that their sins were the cause of any
   interruption which had taken place in the communication of the divine
   favor to the Jews. The passage is parallel with that,

   "The ear of the Lord is not heavy that it cannot hear, but our
   iniquities have separated betwixt us and him." -- Isaiah 59:1

   David imputes it to his own sins and those of the people, that God, who
   was wont to be liberal in his help, and so gracious and kind in
   inviting their dependence upon him, had withdrawn for a time his divine
   countenance. First, he acknowledges his own personal guilt; afterwards,
   like Daniel 9:5, he joins the whole nation with himself. And this truth
   is introduced by the Psalmist with no design to damp confidence in
   prayer, but rather to remove an obstacle standing in the way of it, as
   none could draw near to God unless convinced that he would hear the
   unworthy. It is probable that the Lord's people were at theft time
   suffering under some token of the divine displeasure, since David seems
   here to struggle with some temptation of this kind. He evidently felt
   that there was a sure remedy at hand, for no sooner has he referred to
   the subject of guilt, than he recognises the prerogative of God to
   pardon and expiate it. The verse before us must be viewed in connection
   with the preceding, and as meaning, that though their iniquities
   merited their being cast out of God's sight, yet they would continue to
   pray, encouraged by his readiness to be reconciled to them. We learn
   from the passage that God will not be entreated of us, unless we humbly
   supplicate the pardon of our sins. On the other hand, we are to believe
   firmly in reconciliation with God being procured through gratuitous
   remission. Should he at any time withdraw his favor, and frown upon us,
   we must learn by David's example to rise to the hope of the expiation
   of our sins. The reason of his using the singular number, in the
   confession which he makes of sin, may be, that as king he represented
   the whole people, or that he intended, like Daniel, to exhort them each
   to an individual and particular examination and confession of his own
   guilt. We know how apt hypocrites are to hide their personal sin, under
   a formal acknowledgement of their share in the general transgression.
   But David, from no affectation of humility, but from deep inward
   conviction, begins with himself, and afterwards includes others in the
   same charge.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [445] In our English version it is also waiteth, and in the margin is
   silent. "Waiteth as a servant, whose duty it is to do what thou
   commandest." -- Boothroyd. "The allusion in this verse is beautiful,
   when we remember that Eastern servants wait in silence, watching their
   lords, waiting for the signs of their will." -- Edwards.

   [446] The Hebrew word here rendered, "Thou shalt purge them away," is
   tkphrm, techapperem; properly, "thou wilt make atonement for them." It
   is from the verb kphr, kaphar, which signifies to cover, to draw over;
   and which in the conjugation pihel, acquired the signification to
   forgive, (as it were to cover an offense,) and to do any act which
   shall be the cause or occasion of forgiveness; and thence, by a further
   process in the flow of ideas, to compensate, to expiate, to propitiate,
   and to accept an expiation." See Dr Pye Smith on The Sacrifice of
   Christ, pp. 339, 340. The covering of the ark was called kphrt,
   kapporeth, Exodus 25:17; in Greek hilasterion, that is, the
   propitiatory or mercy-seat; for upon it the blood of expiation, typical
   of the blood of Christ, was sprinkled on the great day of atonement;
   and from it God revealed his grace and will to his ancient people. The
   name hilasterion, is in Romans 3:25, given by Paul to Christ, who was
   the true propitiation for our sins, 1 John 2:2. The words of the
   Psalmist then, without doubt, have a reference to the expiatory
   sacrifices under the law, and consequently to Him who, "in the end of
   the ages, hath appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself."

   [447] In our English Bible it is, "Iniquities prevail against me;" and
   on the margin, "Words or matters of iniquity," etc. Calvin gives the
   same meaning which is naturally suggested by our English version,
   although from his translating the Hebrew text by words of iniquity, we
   would at first view be apt, to suppose that he would explain them as
   referring to the evil reports, the calumnies and slanders, which
   David's enemies propagated against him to ruin his reputation. Dr Adam
   Clarke understands the words in this sense, and gives a translation
   equivalent to Calvin's "Iniquitous words have prevailed against me,"
   or, "The words of iniquity are strong against me." -- He thinks the
   reading of our English Bible "Is no just rendering of the original;"
   observing, that "this verse has been abused to favor Antinomian
   licentiousness;" and that "the true and correct translation of the
   former clause will prevent this." But we cannot see how the verse, as
   it stands in our English Bible, can with justice be viewed as tending
   to give encouragement to sin, it being no more than the confession of a
   repentant sinner, accompanied with hope in the mercy of God, founded on
   the glad tidings announced in the Gospel, that God is willing to pardon
   the most guilty who believe in his Son, and repent of their sins. The
   old Scottish, version of this verse -- "Iniquities, I must confess,
   Prevail against me do:
   And as for our transgressions.
   Them purge away wilt thou," which this learned author terms "most
   execrable" and "abominable doggerel" -- and at hearing which he
   supposes David would feel chagrin, if such a feeling could affect the
   inhabitants of heaven -- is, it must be admitted, ill expressed,
   feeble, and easily susceptible of an Antinomian sense. But not so, we
   think, the revised version, now in very general use in Scotland, which,
   by the alteration of a single word in the beginning of the third line,
   has made the verse at the same time more correct and more nervous: --
   "But as for our transgressions,
   Them purge away shalt thou:" thus implying at once a deep sense of the
   evil of sin, and a confident reliance on the forgiving mercy of God --
   two subjects on which it is of the highest importance for us to
   entertain just views in drawing near to God in prayer. Dr Morrison
   gives the following rendering: -- "Our iniquities prevail against us;
   But thou art he who blotteth out our transgressions." Horsley's version
   is: -- "The account of iniquities is too great for me:
   Thou shalt expiate our crimes."

   Psalm 65:4-8

   4. Blessed is the man whom thou hast chosen, and hast brought near
   thee; we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of the
   sanctuary of thy palace. 5. Terrible things in righteousness wilt thou
   answer to us, O God of our salvation! the hope of all the ends of the
   earth, and the far of places of the sea. [448] 6. By his strength
   setting fast the mountains, being girded with power. [449] 7. Stilling
   the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the
   nations. 8. They also that dwell in the ends of the earth shall fear at
   thy signs; thou shalt make the outgoings of the evening and morning to
   rejoice.


   4. Blessed is the man whom thou hast chosen Having already acknowledged
   that the people had separated themselves from God by their sins, and
   forfeited all right to be heard, he now takes refuge in the free grace
   of God, which secures the remission of sin amongst other blessings. He
   thus casts an additional light upon what he had said on the point of
   guilt being purged away, by pointing to the cause of God, as being
   favorable to poor sinners, which can only be found in his fatherly love
   leading him to welcome them into his presence, however undeserving.
   That pardon which we daily receive flows from our adoption, and on it
   also are all our prayers founded. How could the sinner venture into the
   sight of God, to obtain reconciliation with him, were he not persuaded
   of his being a Father? In the words before us, David does not speak of
   the grace of God as reaching to the Gentiles, (which he had done in a
   preceding part of the psalm,) but in terms which apply only to the
   times in which he wrote. The Church of God was confined to the Jews,
   and they only were admitted into the sanctuary; whereas now, when the
   distinction has been abolished, and other nations called to the same
   privilege, we are all at liberty to approach him with familiarity.
   Christ is our peace, (Ephesians 2:14,) who has united in one those who
   were far off, and those who were nigh.

   What has been now said may show at once the scope of the Psalmist. The
   Church and chosen people of God being in possession of the promise of
   the remission of sin, he calls those blessed whom God has included
   within that number, and introduced into the enjoyment of such a
   distinguished privilege. His language intimates, that the election did
   not at that time terminate upon all; for he insists upon it as the
   special prerogative of the Jews, that they had been chosen by God in
   preference to the other nations. Were it supposed that man could do
   anything to anticipate the grace of God, the election would cease to be
   with God himself, although the right and power of it are expressly
   ascribed to him. [450] But the Jews had no excellency above others,
   except in the one point of having enjoyed the distinguishing favor of
   God. The middle wall of partition is now broken down, that the Gentiles
   might be called in. It is evident, however, that all are not alike
   called; and observation proves the ignorance of those who will assert
   that the grace of God is extended to all in common, without any choice
   exerted on his part. Can any reason be imagined why God should not call
   all alike, except it be that his sovereign election distinguishes some
   from others? Faith and prayer may be means for procuring us an interest
   in the grace of God; but the source whence it flows is not within but
   without us. [451] There is a blessedness in exercising trust upon God,
   and embracing his promises -- a blessedness experienced when, through
   faith in Christ the Mediator, we apprehend him as our Father, and
   direct our prayers to him in that character; -- but ere this faith and
   prayer can have any existence, it must be supposed that we who are
   estranged from God by nature have been brought near by an exercise of
   his favor. We are near him, not as having anticipated his grace, and
   come to him of ourselves, but because, in his condescension, he has
   stretched out his hand as far as hell itself to reach us. To speak more
   properly, he first elects us, and then testifies his love by calling
   us. It is noticeable, also, that though God separated the seed of
   Abraham to be a peculiar people, entitled as the circumcision to a
   place in his temple, there can be no question that David recognised a
   distinction even amongst those who were Jews, all not having been the
   subjects of God's effectual calling, nor yet properly entitled to a
   place in his temple. The Psalmist alludes, indeed, to the outward
   sanctuary, when he speaks of the Jews as chosen to approach God; but we
   must remember (what was brought under our attention, Psalm 15:1 and
   Psalm 24:3) that all were not real members of the Church who trod the
   court of the temple, but that the great qualifications necessary were
   the pure heart and the clean hands. Accordingly, we must understand by
   those brought near to God, such as present themselves before him in the
   exercise of genuine faith, and not such as merely occupy a place in his
   temple as to outward appearance. But, again, the being chosen, and the
   being called to approach God, are two things mentioned here together,
   to correct any such vain idea as that the sheep of God's flock are
   allowed to wander at will for any length of time, and not brought into
   the fold. [452] This is one way by which our gratuitous adoption is
   evidenced, that we come to the sanctuary under the leading of the Holy
   Spirit.

   The Psalmist insists upon the fruit springing out of the blessed
   privilege of which he had spoken, when he adds, that believers would be
   satisfied with the fullness of his temple. Hypocrites may go there, but
   they return empty and unsatisfied as to any spiritual blessing enjoyed.
   It is noticeable, that the person is changed in this part of the verse,
   and that David associates himself with other believers, preferring to
   speak upon this subject from personal experience. We are not to
   understand that believers are fully replenished with the goodness of
   God at any one moment; it is conveyed to them gradually; but while the
   influences of the Spirit are thus imparted in successive measures, each
   of them is enriched with a present sufficiency, till all be in due time
   advanced to perfection. I might remark here, that while it is true, as
   stated, (Psalm 103:5,) that "God satisfieth our mouth with good
   things," at the same time it is necessary to remember what is said
   elsewhere, "Open thy mouth, and I will fill it." Our contracted desires
   is the reason why we do not receive a more copious supply of blessings
   from God; he sees that we are straitened in ourselves, and accommodates
   the communications of his goodness to the measure of our expectations.
   By specifying particularly the goodness of the sanctuary, the Psalmist
   passes an implied commendation upon the outward helps which God has
   appointed for leading us into the enjoyment of heavenly blessings. In
   these former times God could have directly stretched out his hand from
   heaven to supply the wants of his worshippers, but saw fit to satisfy
   their souls by means of the doctrine of the law, sacrifices, and other
   rites and external aids to piety. Similar are the means which he
   employs in the Church still; and though we are not to rest in these,
   neither must we neglect them.

   5 Terrible things [453] in righteousness wilt thou answer to us He
   proceeds to illustrate, although in a somewhat different form, the same
   point of the blessedness of those who are admitted into the temple of
   God, and nourished in his house. He declares that God would answer his
   people by miracles or fearful signs, displaying his power; as if he had
   said, in deliverances as wonderful as those which he wrought for their
   fathers when they went out of Egypt. It is in no common or ordinary
   manner that God has preserved his Church, but with terrible majesty. It
   is well that this should be known, and the people of God taught to
   sustain their hopes in the most apparently desperate exigencies. The
   Psalmist speaks of the deliverances of God as specially enjoyed by the
   Jewish nation, but adds, that he was the hope of the ends of the earth,
   even to the world's remotest extremities. Hence it follows, that the
   grace of God was to be extended to the Gentiles.

   6. By his strength setting fast the mountains For the sake of
   illustration, he instances the power of God seen in the general fabric
   of the world. In these times it sounded as a new and strange truth to
   say that the Gentiles should be called to the same hope with the Jews.
   To prove that it was not so incredible as they were apt to conceive,
   the Psalmist very properly adverts to the Divine power apparent in all
   parts of the world. He instances the mountains rather than the plains,
   because the immense masses of earth, and the lofty rocks which they
   present, convey a more impressive idea of the Godhead. Interpreters are
   not agreed as to the exact meaning of the verse which follows. Some
   think that the mark of similitude must be supplied before the first
   word of the sentence, and that it is meant to be said that God stills
   the tumults of men when raging in their insolent attempts, as he stills
   the agitations of the sea. Others understand the first part of the
   verse to be a metaphorical declaration of what is plainly stated in the
   close. I would take the words simply as they stand, and consider that
   in the first member of the verse, David adverts to the illustration of
   the divine power which we have in the sea, and in the second to that
   which we have in his operations amongst men. His strength is shown in
   calming the waves and tempestuous swellings of the ocean. It is put
   forth also in quelling tumults which may have been raised by the
   people.

   8 They also that dwell, etc. By the signs referred to, we must
   evidently understand those signal and memorable works of the Lord which
   bear the impress of his glorious hand. It is true, that the minutest
   and meanest objects, whether in the heavens or upon the earth, reflect
   to some extent the glory of God; but the name mentioned emphatically
   applies to miracles, as affording a better display of the divine
   majesty. So striking would be the proofs of God's favor to his Church,
   that, as the Psalmist here intimates to us, they would constrain the
   homage and wonder of the most distant and barbarous nations. In the
   latter part of the verse, if we take the interpretation suggested by
   some, nothing more is meant, than that when the sun rises in the
   morning, men are refreshed by its light; and again, that when the moon
   and stars appear at night, they are relieved from the gloom into which
   they must otherwise have been sunk. Were this interpretation adopted, a
   preposition must be understood; as if it had been said, Thou makest men
   to rejoice on account of, or by the rising of the sun, of the moon, and
   of the stars. But the words, as they stand, convey a sense which is
   sufficiently appropriate without having recourse to any addition. It
   was said, that in consequence of the wonders done by the Lord, fear
   would spread itself over the uttermost parts of the earth; and the same
   thing is now asserted of the joy which they would shed abroad: from the
   rising to the setting sun, men would rejoice in the Lord, as well as
   fear him.

   [448] ym, yam, the sea, is frequently employed to denote the islands
   which are encompassed by the sea, and being here set in opposition to
   "the ends or extreme parts of the earth," that is, the continent, it
   signifies the most remote islands of the world. Accordingly, the
   Chaldee paraphrase is, "And of the islands of the sea which are remote
   from the continent." The concluding part of this verse is evidently
   prophetical of that period when all mankind, when people of every tribe
   and color and clime, shall be blessed with the knowledge of the gospel,
   and worship the only true God.

   [449] From the length and looseness of the garments of the inhabitants
   of the East, in ancient times, it was necessary to bind them close with
   a girdle, when they intended to exert their strength. Hence the
   expression, "girded with strength." Dr Lowth thinks the allusion is to
   the vesture of the Aaronical priesthood. -- Lectures on Sacred Poetry,
   volume 1, pp. 173-175.

   [453] The original word for terrible things "signifies sometimes

   speaking of God, it is said, He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that
   hath done for thee these great and terrible things,' -- great,
   exceeding, wonderful things; and those acts of mercy, and not of
   justice or punishment; and so here it appears to signify, being joined
   with answering us, or granting us, in answer to our prayers, (so nt
   signifies to answer a request, to hear a prayer,) and with in
   righteousness, which frequently imports mercy The LXX. accordingly read
   it thaumastos, wonderful." -- Hammond

   Psalm 65:9-13

   9. Thou hast visited the earth, and watered it; thou hast greatly
   enriched it; the river of God is full of waters: thou wilt prepare
   their corn, for so thou hast provided for it. 10. Thou dost saturate
   its furrows, thou makest the rain to fall into them; thou moistenest it
   with showers; thou blessest the buddings forth of it. 11. Thou crownest
   the year with thy goodness, and thy paths will drop fatness. 12. They
   drop upon the dwellings [454] of the wilderness, and the hills shall be
   girt about with gladness; [455] 13. The pastures are clothed with
   flocks, the valleys are covered with corn; they shout for joy, they
   also sing.


   9. Thou hast visited the earth, and watered it This and the verbs which
   follow denote action continually going forward, and may therefore be
   rendered in the present tense. The exact meaning of the second verb in
   the sentence has been disputed. Some derive it from the verb svq, shuk,
   signifying to desire; and giving this meaning, that God visits the
   earth after it has been made dry and thirsty by long drought. [456]
   Others derive it from the verb sqh, shakah, signifying to give drink.
   This seems the most natural interpretation -- Thou visitest the earth
   by watering it. It suits the connection better, for it follows, thou
   plentifully enrichest it, an expression obviously added by way of
   amplification. Whether the Psalmist speaks of Judea only, or of the
   world at large, is a point as to which different opinions may be held.
   I am disposed myself to think, that although what he says applies to
   the earth generally, he refers more particularly to Judea, as the
   former part of the psalm has been occupied with recounting the kindness
   of God to his own Church and people more especially. This view is
   confirmed by what is added, the stream or river of God is full of water
   Some take the river of God to mean a great or mighty river, [457] but
   such a rendering is harsh and overstrained, and on that supposition,
   rivers, in the plural number, would have been the form of expression
   used. I consider that he singles out the small rivulet of Siloah, [458]
   and sets it in opposition to the natural rivers which enrich other
   countries, intending an allusion to the word of Moses, (Deuteronomy
   11:10,) that the land which the Lord their God should give unto his
   people would not be as the land of Egypt, fertilized by the
   overflowings of the Nile, but a land drinking water of the rain of
   heaven. Or we may suppose that he calls the rain itself metaphorically
   the river of God [459] The words must, at any rate, be restricted to
   Judea, as by the pastures or dwellings of the wilderness, we are also
   to understand the more dry and uncultivated districts, called in
   Scripture "the hill country." But while it is the kindness of God to
   his own people which is here more particularly celebrated as being
   better known, we are bound, in whatever part of the world we live, to
   acknowledge the riches of the Divine goodness seen in the earth's
   fertility and increase. It is not of itself that it brings forth such
   an inexhaustible variety of fruits, but only in so far as it has been
   fitted by God for producing the food of man. Accordingly, there is a
   propriety and force in the form of expression used by the Psalmist when
   he adds, that corn is provided for man, because the earth has been so
   prepared by God; [460] which means, that the reason of that abundance
   with which the earth teems, is its having been expressly formed by God
   in his fatherly care of the great household of mankind, to supply the
   wants of his children.

   10. Thou dost saturate its furrows Some take the verbs as being in the
   optative mood, and construe the words as a prayer. But there can be
   little doubt that David still continues the strain of thanksgiving, and
   praises God for moistening and saturating the earth with rains that it
   may be fitted for producing fruit. By this he would signify to us, that
   the whole order of things in nature shows the fatherly love of God, in
   condescending to care for our daily sustenance. He multiplies his
   expressions when speaking of a part of the divine goodness, which many
   have wickedly and impiously disparaged. It would seem as if the more
   perspicacity men have in observing second causes in nature, they will
   rest in them the more determinedly, instead of ascending by them to
   God. Philosophy ought to lead us upwards to him, the more that it
   penetrates into the mystery of his works; but this is prevented by the
   corruption and ingratitude of our hearts; and as those who pride
   themselves in their acuteness, avert their eye from God to find the
   origin of rain in the air and the elements, it was the more necessary
   to awaken us out of such a spirit.

   11 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness [461] Some read -- Thou
   crownest the year of thy goodness; as if the Psalmist meant that the
   fertile year had a peculiar glory attached to it, and were crowned, so
   to speak, by God. Thus, if there was a more abundant crop or vintage
   than usual, this would be the crown of the year. And it must be granted
   that God does not bless every year alike. Still there is none but what
   is crowned with some measure of excellency; and for that reason it
   would seem best to retain the simpler rendering of the words, and view
   them as meaning that the Divine goodness is apparent in the annual
   returns of the season. The Psalmist further explains what he intended,
   when he adds, that the paths of God dropped fatness, -- using this as a
   metaphorical term for the clouds, upon which God rideth, as upon
   chariots, as we read in Psalm 104:3 [462] The earth derives its
   fruitfulness from the sap or moisture; this comes from the rain, and
   the rain from the clouds. With a singular gracefulness of expression,
   these are therefore represented as dropping fatness, and this because
   they are the paths or vehicles of God; as if he had said, that,
   wherever the Deity walked there flowed down from his feet fruits in
   endless variety and abundance. He amplifies this goodness of God, by
   adding, that his fatness drops even upon the wilder and more
   uncultivated districts. The wilderness is not to be taken here for the
   absolute waste where nothing grows, but for such places as are not so
   well cultivated, where there are few inhabitants, and where,
   notwithstanding, the Divine goodness is even more illustrated than
   elsewhere in dropping down fatness upon the tops of the mountains.
   [463] Notice is next taken of the valleys and level grounds, to show
   that there is no part of the earth overlooked by God, and that the
   riches of his liberality extend over all the world. The variety of its
   manifestation is commended when it is added, that the valleys and lower
   grounds are clothed with flocks, [464] as well as with corn. He
   represents inanimate things as rejoicing, which may be said of them in
   a certain sense, as when we speak of the fields smiling, when they
   refresh our eye with their beauty. It may seem strange, that he should
   first tell us, that they shout for joy, and then add the feebler
   expression, that they sing; interposing, too, the intensative particle,
   'ph, aph, they shout for joy, yea, they also sing The verb, however,
   admits of being taken in the future tense, they shall sing, and this
   denotes a continuation of joy, that they would rejoice, not only one
   year, but through the endless succession of the seasons. I may add,
   what is well known, that in Hebrew the order of expression is
   frequently inverted in this way.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [454] "Ou, pasturages," -- Fr. marg. "Or, pastures."

   [455] "Curiously wrought or embroidered girdles are still, as they were
   of old, an essential part of Eastern finery both to men and women. It
   is in allusion probably to such sumptuous girdles worn particularly on
   joyful occasions, that the Psalmist here represents the hills as girded
   with joy.'" -- Mant.

   [456] This is the sense preferred by Aben Ezra and Kimchi. Thou hast
   visited in mercy; i.e., blessed the earth or land, after thou hast made
   it dry or thirsty; thou hast or dost enrich it greatly; i.e., thou, the
   same God, who hast punished and made thirsty dost again return in
   mercy, enriching the land and restoring plenty to it. Thus it was after
   the three years' famine recorded in 2 Samuel 21:1. But the Septuagint,
   Arabic, Chaldee, and Syriac versions, interpret the word in the sense
   of watering.

   [457] Some think reference is made to the overflowing of the Jordan
   after a long drought.

   [458] This river ran through Jerusalem, the city of God. Bishop Hare,
   following Simeon de Muis, is of opinion that this river is meant.

   [459] "The stream of God, i e., copious rain, according to the Oriental
   idiom." -- Dr Geddes. See p. 7, note 1, of this volume. And without
   supposing this Hebraism, the treasures of water which descend from the
   clouds may, with great poetical beauty, be termed the river of God He
   collects them there by the wonderful process of evaporation, and he
   pours them down. They are entirely in his hand, and absolutely beyond
   the control of man. "The keys of the clouds," say the Jews, "are
   peculiarly kept in God's hand, as the keys of life and resurrection."
   He can employ them as the instruments of his mercy, by pouring down
   from them upon the earth copious and refreshing showers, to promote
   vegetation and produce fruitful seasons; and he can also make them when
   he pleases the instruments of judgment, either by bottling them up, or
   by pouring from them floods of rain, as in the deluge, and when the
   harvest is made a heap in the day of grief and desperate sorrow, Isaiah
   17:11. Horsley, instead of phlg, peleg, in the singular, proposes to
   read phlgvt, pelagoth, in the plural, and translates, "God is he who
   filleth the rivulets with water." "The word phlg," says he, "as
   remarked by "Archbishop Secker, is very rarely used as a noun in the
   singular number. Mr Bates, indeed, takes it to be a noun in Psalm 55:9;
   but his interpretation of that text is very doubtful. In the plural it
   never signifies large rivers, but small brooks and rivulets. We have
   the authority of the Syriac for reading it in the plural."

   [460] In the Septuagint the last clause reads, "Oti houtos he
   hetoimasia," "For thus is the preparation;" that is, the earth was thus
   prepared. In the Syriac it is, "When thou didst found or establish it;"
   and in the Chaldee, "Seeing thou hast so founded it."

   [461] This, say some, was probably the year which followed the three
   years of famine, after Absalom's rebellion.

   [462] Some have imagined that instead of paths we should render cloud;
   but the former reading is more poetical. The original word mglk, paths,
   is derived from gl, round, circular, smooth, because paths are made by
   cart-wheels turning round upon them. Accordingly, Horsley renders it,
   "thy chariot-wheels," and French and Skinner, "the tracts of thy
   chariot-wheels." God is here represented as driving round the earth,
   and from the clouds the paths of his chariot everywhere scattering
   blessings upon mankind. This is an instance of the bold and sublime
   imagery for which the Hebrew poetry is so remarkably distinguished. God
   is elsewhere described as riding on the clouds during a storm of rain
   or thunder, Psalm 18:9, 10, 11. Some read, "thy orbits," and understand
   all the circling seasons of the year, as ruled by the courses of the
   heavenly bodies.

   [463] "By desert or wilderness," observes Dr Shaw, "the reader is not
   always to understand a country altogether barren and unfruitful, but
   such only as is rarely or never sown or cultivated; which, though it
   yields no crops of corn or fruit, yet affords herbage, more or less,
   for the grazing of cattle, with fountains or rills of water, though
   more sparingly interspersed than in other places."

   [464] The phrase, "the pastures are clothed with flocks," cannot be
   regarded as the vulgar language of poetry. It appears peculiarly
   beautiful and appropriate, when we consider the numerous flocks which
   whitened the plains of Syria and Canaan. In the Eastern countries,
   sheep are much more prolific than with us, and they derive their name
   from their great fruitfulness; bringing forth, as they are said to do,
   "thousands and ten thousands in their streets," Psalm 144:13. They,
   therefore, formed no mean part of the wealth of the East.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [444] The title of this psalm does not inform us on what particular
   occasion it was written. Mudge is of opinion that it was "composed by a
   person just come to Jerusalem from some very distant parts, where, upon
   his prayers and vows, he had been signally delivered from the fury of
   the sea, and uproar of the natives; which leads him into a general
   acknowledgement of the Divine Providence which extended itself to the
   end of the earth." It is thought by others to be a thanksgiving to God
   for having graciously sent to the land of Judea a copious rain, after
   it had been previously suffering from the effects of a long-continued
   drought; and that it probably relates to the three years of famine that
   followed some time after the rebellion of Absalom, (2 Samuel 21) which,
   being alleviated by some plenteous showers of rain, called forth this
   hymn of thanksgiving. Dr Morrison supposes that David wrote it for the
   feast of tabernacles, as it seems to contain an expression of public
   thanksgiving for the fruits of the earth, which had been safely
   gathered in. All these, however, are only conjectures. Nor is it
   material for us to know the occasion of its composition, embracing, as
   it does, such general topics as may form a suitable theme for
   contemplation at all times and in all circumstances.

   PSALM 66

   There may have been one deliverance in particular, which the Psalmist
   celebrates here in the name of the Church, but he includes the many and
   various mercies which God had all along conferred upon his chosen
   people. While he takes notice of the divine interposition in their
   behalf, in a crisis of great mercy and distress, he suggests it as
   matter of comfort under trial, that their subjection to the tyranny of
   their enemies had been designed to prove them as silver in the furnace.
   At the close, he would appear to speak of himself individually, and
   adduces it as a proof of his integrity, that God had heard him, for God
   does not grant acceptance to the wicked.

   To the chief musician, the Song of a Psalm. [465]

   Psalm 66:1-4

   1. Shout unto God, all the earth. 2. Sing the honor of his name: make
   glorious his praise. [466] 3. Say unto God, How terrible art thou in
   thy works! in the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies lie [or
   feign submission] unto thee. 4. All the earth shall worship thee, and
   they shall sing unto thee; they shall sing thy name. Selah.


   1. Shout unto God, all the earth The psalm begins with this general
   declaration, which is afterwards reduced to particulars. [467] He
   addresses himself to the whole world, and from this it would seem
   evident, that he predicts the extent to which the kingdom of God should
   reach at the coming of Christ. In the second verse the call is repeated
   with increasing vehemency, to stir up to the praises of God, such as
   might otherwise be remiss in the service. To sing the honor of his
   name, is an expression sufficiently obvious; meaning, that we should
   extol his sacred name in a manner suitable to its dignity, so that it
   may obtain its due and deserved adoration. But the clause which follows
   is rather ambiguous. Some think that it conveys a repetition of the
   same idea contained in other words, and read, set forth the glory of
   his praise. [468] I prefer taking the Hebrew word signifying praise to
   be in the accusative case; rendering the words literally, make a glory
   his praise. And by this I understand him to mean, not as some do, that
   we should glory exclusively in his praises, [469] but simply, that we
   highly exalt his praises, that they may be glorious. The Psalmist is
   not satisfied with our declaring them moderately, and insists that we
   should celebrate his goodness in some measure proportionably to its
   excellence.

   3. Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! Here he proceeds
   to state the grounds why he would have us to praise God. Many content
   themselves with coldly descanting to others of his praises, but with
   the view of awakening and more deeply impressing our hearts, he directs
   us to address ourselves immediately to God. It is when we hold converse
   with him apart, and with no human eye to witness us, that we feel the
   vanity of hypocrisy, and will be likely to utter only what we have well
   and seriously meditated in our hearts. Nothing tends more to beget a
   reverential awe of God upon our spirits than sisting ourselves in his
   presence. What the Psalmist adds is fitted and designed to produce the
   same feeling, that through the greatness of God's power, his enemies
   feign submission to him Are they who would perversely and obstinately
   revolt from his service, forced to humble themselves before him,
   whether they will it or not, how much more, then, ought his own
   children to serve him, who are invited into his presence, by the
   accents of tenderness, instead of being reduced to subjection by
   terror? There is an implied contrast drawn between the voluntary homage
   which they yield, as attracted by the sweet influences of grace, and
   that slavish obedience which is wrung reluctantly from the unbeliever.
   The Hebrew word here used for to lie, signifies to yield such a
   submission as is constrained, and not free or cordial, as Psalm 18:45.
   Neither the words nor the scope favor the other senses which have been
   suggested, as, that his enemies would acknowledge themselves to have
   been deceived in their hopes, or that they would deny having ever
   intended hostilities against him. There are many ways in which
   hypocrites may lie, but nothing more is meant by the Psalmist here,
   than that the power of God is such as to force them into a reluctant
   subjection.

   4. All the earth shall worship thee. The Psalmist had good reason for
   insisting upon this one point again and again. Though all tongues were
   tuned to the praise of God, they never could adequately extol it; and
   yet such are the negligence and the perversity of men, that they will
   scarcely lift one feeble note in celebration of a theme which should
   command their united strength and might. We have another prediction
   here, of a time being to come when God would be worshipped, not only by
   the Jews, a small section of the human family, but by all the nations
   which would be eventually brought under his government. And we are not
   to consider that he refers to such a worship as would be constrained,
   and only not withheld, because resistance might be dangerous, but to
   the sincere homage of the heart -- they shall sing unto thee! they
   shall sing unto thy name Praise is the best of all sacrifices, (as we
   are told, Psalm 50:14, 23) and the true evidence of godliness. [470]

   Psalm 66:5-9

   5. Come and see the works of God; he is terrible in his dealing towards
   the children of men. 6. He turned the sea into dry land; they went
   through the flood on foot; there did we rejoice in him. 7. He ruleth by
   his power over the world; his eyes behold the nations; rebels [471]
   shall not exalt themselves. 8. Bless our God; [472] O ye people! and
   resound the voice of his praise. 9. Who hath brought our souls unto
   life, and hath not suffered our feet to fall.


   5. Come and see the works of God An indirect censure is here passed
   upon that almost universal thoughtlessness which leads men to neglect
   the praises of God. Why is it that they so blindly overlook the
   operations of his hand, but just because they never direct their
   attention seriously to them? We need to be aroused upon this subject.
   The words before us may receive some explanation by referring to a
   parallel passage, Psalm 46:8. But the great scope of them is this, that
   the Psalmist would withdraw men from the vain or positively sinful and
   pernicious pursuits in which they are engaged, and direct their
   thoughts to the works of God. To this he exhorts them, chiding their
   backwardness and negligence. The expression, Come and see, intimates
   that what they blindly overlooked was open to observation; for were it
   otherwise with the works of God, this language would be inappropriate.
   He next points out what those works of God are to which he would have
   our attention directed; in general he would have us look to the method
   in which God governs the human family. This experimental or practical
   kind of knowledge, if I might so call it, is that which makes the
   deepest impression. [473] We find, accordingly, that Paul, (Acts 17:27)
   after speaking of the power of God in general, brings his subject to
   bear upon this one particular point, and calls upon us to descend into
   ourselves if we would discover the proofs of a present God. The last
   clause of the fifth verse I would not interpret with some as meaning
   that God was terrible above the children of men -- superior to them in
   majesty -- but rather that he is terrible towards them, evincing an
   extraordinary providence in their defense and preservation, as we have
   seen noticed, Psalm 40:5. Men need look no further, therefore, than
   themselves, in order to discover the best grounds for reverencing and
   fearing God. The Psalmist passes next from the more general point of
   his providence towards mankind at large, to his special care over his
   own Church, adverting to what he had done for the redemption of his
   chosen people. What he states here must be considered as only one
   illustration of many which he might have touched upon, and as intended
   to remind God's people of the infinite variety of benefits with which
   their first and great deliverance had been followed up and confirmed.
   This appears obvious from what he adds, there we rejoiced in him It is
   impossible that the joy of that deliverance could have extended to him
   or any of the descendants of the ancient Israelites, unless it had
   partaken the nature of a pledge and illustration of the love of God to
   the Church generally. Upon that event he showed himself to be the
   everlasting Savior of his people; so that it proved a common source of
   joy to all the righteous.

   7. He ruleth by his power over the world The Hebrew word vlm, olam,
   which I have translated the world, signifies occasionally an age, or
   eternity; [474] but the first sense seems to agree best with the
   context, and the meaning of the words is, that God is endued with the
   power necessary for wielding the government of the world. What follows
   agrees with this, that his eyes behold the nations Under the law, Judea
   was the proper seat of his kingdom; but his providence always extended
   to the world at large; and the special favor shown to the posterity of
   Abraham, in consideration of the covenant, did not prevent him from
   extending an eye of providential consideration to the surrounding
   nations. As an evidence of his care reaching to the different countries
   round, he takes notice of the judgments which God executed upon the
   wicked and the ungodly. He proves that there was no part of the human
   family which God overlooked, by referring to the fact of the punishment
   of evil-doers. There may be much in the Divine administration of the
   world calculated to perplex our conclusions; but there are always some
   tokens to be seen of his judgments, and these sufficiently clear to
   strike the eye of an acute and attentive observer.

   8 Bless our God, O ye people! Although calling upon all, without
   exception, to praise God, he refers particularly to some Divine
   interposition in behalf of the Church. He would seem to hint that the
   Gentiles were destined, at a future period, to share the favor now
   exclusively enjoyed by God's chosen people. In the meantime, he reminds
   them of the signal and memorable nature of the deliverance granted, by
   calling upon them to spread abroad the fame of it. Though he speaks of
   the Jewish people as having been brought unto life, (an expression
   intended to denote deliverance of a more than ordinary kind,) this
   means that they had been preserved from approaching danger rather than
   recovered from a calamity which had actually overtaken them, It is said
   that their feet had not been suffered to fall, which implies, that,
   through seasonable help which they had received, they had not fallen,
   but stood firm. The Psalmist, however, does not take occasion, from the
   evil having been anticipated and averted, to undervalue it. As they had
   been preserved safe by an interposition of Divine goodness, he speaks
   of this as tantamount to having been brought or restored to life.

   Psalm 66:10-12

   10. For thou, O God! hast proved us, thou hast tried us as silver is
   tried. 11. Thou broughtest us into the net, thou laidest restraint upon
   our loins. 12. Thou hast made man to ride over our heads, [475] we have
   come into fire and water, and thou hast brought us into a fruitful
   place. [476]


   10 For thou, O God! hast proved us We may read, Though thou, O God!
   etc., and then the passage comes in as a qualification of what went
   before, and is brought forward by the Psalmist to enhance the goodness
   of God, who had delivered them from such severe calamities. But there
   is another object which I consider him to have in view, and this is the
   alleviation of the grief of God's people, by setting before them the
   comfort suggested by the words which follow. When visited with
   affliction, it is of great importance that we should consider it as
   coming from God, and as expressly intended for our good. It is in
   reference to this that the Psalmist speaks of their having been proved
   and tried. At the same time, while he adverts to God's trying his
   children with the view of purging away their sin, as dross is expelled
   from the silver by fire, he would intimate, also, that trial had been
   made of their patience. The figure implies that their probation had
   been severe; for silver is cast repeatedly into the furnace. They
   express themselves thankful to God, that, while proved with affliction,
   they had not been destroyed by it; but that their affliction was both
   varied and very severe, appears not only from the metaphor, but from
   the whole context, where they speak of having been cast into the net,
   being reduced to straits, men riding over their heads, and of being
   brought through shipwreck and conflagration. [477] The expression,
   laying a restraint [or chain] upon their loins, is introduced as being
   stronger than the one which goes before. It was not a net of thread
   which had been thrown over them, but rather they had been bound down
   with hard and insolvable fetters. The expression which follows refers
   to men who had shamefully tyrannised over them, and ridden them down as
   cattle. By fire and water are evidently meant complicated afflictions;
   and it is intimated that God had exercised his people with every form
   of calamity. They are the two elements which contribute more than any
   other to sustain human life, but are equally powerful for the
   destruction of it. It is noticeable, that the Psalmist speaks of all
   the cruelties which they had most unjustly suffered from the hands of
   their enemies, as an infliction of Divine punishment; and would guard
   the Lord's people against imagining that God was ignorant of what they
   had endured, or distracted by other things from giving attention to it.
   In their condition, as here described, we have that of the Church
   generally represented to us; and this, that when subjected to
   vicissitudes, and cast out of the fire into the water, by a succession
   of trials, there may at last be felt to be nothing new or strange in
   the event to strike us with alarm. The Hebrew word rvyh, revayah, which
   I have rendered fruitful place, means literally a well-watered land.
   Here it is taken metaphorically for a condition of prosperity, the
   people of God being represented as brought into a pleasant and fertile
   place, where there is abundance of pasturage. The truth conveyed is,
   that God, although he visit his children with temporary chastisements
   of a severe description, will ultimately crown them with joy and
   prosperity. It is a mistake to suppose that the allusion is entirely to
   their being settled in the land of Canaan, [478] for the psalm has not
   merely reference to the troubles which they underwent in the
   wilderness, but to the whole series of distresses to which they were
   subjected at the different periods of their history.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [475] To ride over; signifies to insult or tyrannise over. But here the
   image may be taken from the trampling of war-horses in the day of
   battle. The cavalry, in the field of battle, pay no regard to the
   fallen, the dying, and the dead, but tread promiscuously upon all that
   come in their way, "Thou hast permitted us," says Dr Adam Clarke, "to
   fall under the dominion of our enemies, who have treated us as broken
   infantry are when the cavalry dashes among their disordered ranks,
   treading all under their horses' feet."

   [476] "In planitiem." -- Lat. "En lieu plantureux." -- Fr.

   [477] "Per naufragium et incendium transiisse." The French version
   reads, "Par l'eau et par le feu;" but it is important to retain the
   original more closely, as giving what Calvin considered to be the sense
   of the words in the text. Fire and water, the one of which elements
   consumes, while the other suffocates, is a proverbial expression,
   signifying, as our author afterwards states, extreme danger and
   complicated calamities. "When thou passest through the waters, I will
   be with thee; when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be
   burnt," Isaiah 43:2. See also Psalm 32:6; Ezekiel 16:6, 7; Numbers
   31:23. Those things are said to come into or to pass through the fire,
   which abide the same, without being consumed; and which, like metals,
   lose only thereby their dross.

   [478] Cresswell takes this view. His note on the place is, "Into a
   wealthy place,' literally into an irriguous region, (comp. Judges
   1:15,) i.e., into a fertile country, a land of abundance, the promised
   land: comp. Exodus 3:8."

   Psalm 66:13-16

   13. I will come into thy house with burnt-offerings; I will pay thee my
   vows, 14. Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I
   was in trouble. 15. I will offer unto thee burnt-sacrifices of
   fatlings, with the incense of rams; [479] I will bring bullocks, with
   goats. Selah. 16. Come, hear, I will tell to all them that fear God,
   what he hath done for my soul.


   13 I will come into thy house with burnt offerings Hitherto the
   Psalmist has spoken in the name of the people at large. Now he
   emphatically gives expression to his own private feelings, and calls
   upon them, by his example, to engage individually in the exercises of
   religion, it being impossible that there should be any hearty common
   consent unless each entered seriously upon the service of thanksgiving
   for himself and apart. We are taught that when God at any time succours
   us in our adversity, we do an injustice to his name if we forget to
   celebrate our deliverances with solemn acknowledgements. More is spoken
   of in this passage than thanksgiving. He speaks of vows having been
   contracted by him in his affliction, and these evidenced the constancy
   of his faith. The exhortation of the Apostle James is worthy of our
   special notice --

   "Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry?
   let him sing psalms." (James 5:13)

   How many are there who lavish their hypocritical praises upon God in
   the career of their good fortune, while they are no sooner reduced to
   straits than the fervor of their love is damped, or gives place to the
   violence of fretfulness and impatience. The best evidence of true piety
   is when we sigh to God under the pressure of our afflictions, and show,
   by our prayers, a holy perseverance in faith and patience; while
   afterwards we come forward with the expression of our gratitude. The
   words, which my lips have uttered, are not an unmeaning addition, but
   imply that he had never allowed himself to be so far overcome by grief
   as not to throw his desires into the express form of petition,
   declaring that he cast himself for safety into the hands of God. On the
   subject of vows, I may just shortly repeat the remarks which have been
   given at greater length elsewhere. First, the holy fathers never vowed
   anything to God but what they knew to be sanctioned by his approval.
   Secondly, their sole end in vowing was to evidence their gratitude. The
   Papists, therefore, can find no warrant, from their example, for the
   rash and impious vows which they practice. They obtrude upon God
   whatever chances to come first into their lips; the end which they
   propose to themselves is the farthest removed from the right one; and
   with devilish presumption they engage themselves to things which are
   not allowed them.

   15 I will offer unto thee burnt-sacrifices of fatlings. We must suppose
   the speaker to be either David or one of the more considerable men of
   the nation, for none in humbler circumstances could have offered rich
   sacrifices of this kind. It is probable that David was the author of
   the psalm, and here he signifies his intention to show a kingly
   liberality in his offerings. The reason why God ordered victims to be
   offered as an expression of thanksgiving was, as is well known, to
   teach the people that their praises were polluted by sin, and needed to
   be sanctified from without. However we might propose to ourselves to
   praise the name of God, we could only profane it with our impure lips,
   had not Christ once offered himself up a sacrifice, to sanctify both us
   and our services. (Hebrews 10:7) It is through him, as we learn from
   the apostle, that our praises are accepted. The Psalmist, by way of
   commendation of his burnt-offering, speaks of its incense or sweet
   savor; for although in themselves vile and loathsome, yet the rams and
   other victims, so far as they were figures of Christ, sent up a sweet
   savor unto God. [480] Now that the shadows of the Law have been
   abolished, attentionis called to the true spiritual service. What this
   consists in, is more clearly brought under our notice in the verse
   which follows, where the Psalmist tells us, that he would spread abroad
   the fame of the benefits which he had received from God. Such was the
   end designed, even in the outward ceremonies under the Law, apart from
   which they could only be considered as an empty show. It was this --
   the fact, that they set forth the praises of the divine goodness --
   which formed the very season of the sacrifices, preserving them from
   insipidity. In calling, as he does, upon all the fearers of the Lord,
   the Psalmist teaches us, that if we duly feel the goodness of God, we
   will be inflamed with a desire to publish it abroad, that others may
   have their faith and hope confirmed, by what they hear of it, as well
   as join with us in a united song of praise. He addresses himself to
   none but such as feared the Lord, for they only could appreciate what
   he had to say, and it would have been lost labor to communicate it to
   the hypocritical and ungodly.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [479] Here Calvin, as well as our English Bible, joins incense with
   rams, appearing to mean by incense, offering by fire, the smoke
   produced by the sacrifice. But the burning of incense was a distinct
   offering from that of animal sacrifices; and therefore many critics
   read the verse so as to make incense a distinct offering. Thus Horsley,
   altering the punctuation, translates, "Offerings of fatlings I will
   offer unto thee, with incense;
   "I will sacrifice rams, bullocks, and full-grown goats." This, we
   think, gives an improved view of the passage. It may be here observed,
   that the Hebrews were not allowed to sacrifice other animals than these
   three kinds, rams, bullocks, and goats.

   [480] "Le Prophere loue yci le perfum de son holocauste, combien qu'il
   n'en peust monter au ciel qu' une odeur puante et infecte: mais il faut
   noter que les beliers et autres bestes qu'on sacrifioit flairoyent bon
   devant Dieu, entant que c'estoyent figures de Iesus Christ." -- Fr.

   Psalm 66:17-20

   17. I cried unto him with my mouth, and have extolled him under [or
   with] my tongue. [481] 18. If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord
   will not hear me. 19. But truly God hath heard me; he hath attended to
   the voice of my prayer. 20. Blessed be God! who hath not turned away my
   prayer, and his mercy from me.


   17. I cried unto him with my mouth He proves that he owed his safety to
   Divine interposition, from the circumstance of his having prayed, and
   in consequence, having sensibly experienced his kindness. Answers to
   prayer serve in no small degree to illustrate the goodness of God; and
   confirm our faith in it. In saying that he cried to God with his mouth
   and tongue, these are terms denoting, as we have seen in a previous
   part of the psalm, the vehemency and earnestness with which he prayed.
   Had he not prayed from the heart, he would have been rejected, but he
   makes mention of the tongue also, in token of the ardor of his
   supplications. Some absurdly imagine, that because the expression under
   the tongue is used, the meaning is with the heart Words are said to
   come from under the tongue, because they are formed by the flexion of
   the tongue, as in that passage,

   "The poison of asps is under their lips," (Psalm 140:3)

   The term extol intimates, that we cannot honor God more in our worship,
   than by looking upwards to him for deliverance. The Papists rob him of
   a chief part of his glory, when they direct their prayers to the dead
   or to images, and make such little account of calling upon the name of
   the Lord.

   The Psalmist next lays down the rule, which must be attended to, if we
   would pray properly and acceptably; guarding against that presumptuous
   exercise which overlooks the necessity of faith and penitence. We see
   with what audacity hypocrites and ungodly men associate themselves with
   the Lord's people, in compliance with the general calls of the word to
   engage in prayer. To check this solemn mockery, the Psalmist mentions
   integrity of heart as indispensable. I am aware that the words may be
   considered as an assertion of his own personal uprightness of conduct,
   as we find him frequently vindicating this, by an appeal to the visible
   and practical proofs which God had shown of his favor to him; but his
   main object is evidently to enforce by the example of his own exercise
   the common propriety of drawing near to God with a pure heart. We have
   a parallel scripture in John 9:31, "We know that God heareth not
   sinners." In one sense, he hears none but sinners; for we must all
   conform to the great rule of applying to him for the remission of our
   sins. But while believers make an unreserved confession of guilt before
   God, by this very thing they cease to be sinners, for God pardons them
   in answer to their supplications. We are not to forget the words of
   Paul,

   "Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity," --
   (2 Timothy 2:19)

   Besides, to regard iniquity in the heart does not mean to be conscious
   of sin -- for all the Lord's people must see their sins and be grieved
   for them, and this is rather praiseworthy than condemnable; -- but to
   be bent upon the practice of iniquity. He particularly refers to the
   heart, intimating that not only were his hands clean, in the sense of
   his being innocent before men, but that he could appeal to God in proof
   of his inward integrity. When the heart does not correspond to the
   outward conduct, and harbours any secret evil intent, the fair exterior
   appearance may deceive men; but it is an abomination in the sight of
   God, The Psalmist affirms with emphasis, that his prayers had been
   answered, and we ought to draw the inference that we shall never be
   disappointed, if we seek God in sincerity.

   20 Blessed be God! who hath not turned away my prayer He concludes the
   psalm, as he began it, with thanksgiving, and gives the reason of his
   not having met with a repulse; or, to take the figurative expression
   which he employs, of God's not having turned away his prayer. This was,
   that he had not withdrawn his mercy. For it is entirely of his free
   grace that he is propitious, and that our prayers are not wholly
   ineffectual.
