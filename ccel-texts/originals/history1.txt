PREFACE

   The following history has been compiled from Wesley's Works, the
   British and American Minutes of Conferences, Moore's and Watson's Life
   of the Wesleys, Asbury's Journal, Lee's History of the Methodists, the
   Life of Dr. Coke, Lee's and Garrettson's Memoirs, Abbott's Life, from
   historical notices and anecdotes of Methodism found in the Arminian and
   Methodist Magazines, the Methodist Magazine and Quarterly Review, the
   Christian Advocate and Journal, together with such original anecdotes
   and historical sketches as I have been able to collect from the lips of
   living persons.

   For the facts contained in the Introduction, I am indebted chiefly to
   Bancroft's "History of the Colonization of the United States" -- a work
   of rare merit and of incomparable worth to the student of American
   history -- collating it, however, with others who have written upon the
   same subject. It would have been no less gratifying to me than edifying
   to the reader, had it been in my power to give a more particular
   account of the religious state of the colonies from the beginning to
   about the middle of the eighteenth Century; but the space allowed in a
   short introduction to the history of one denomination of Christians
   would not admit of a more ample detail of general facts in relation to
   that period of our colonial history.

   About sixteen years since I commenced writing a "History of the
   Methodist Episcopal Church," and had actually brought it down to about
   the year 1810; but the whole manuscript was consumed by the disastrous
   fire which destroyed our Book Room and its valuable contents in the
   winter of 1836. Of this casualty I was not apprised until my return
   from the last General Conference, when, on searching my private desk at
   home, where I thought it had been deposited, my manuscript was not to
   be found; and hence the fact was disclosed that it must have been
   consumed, together with some other documents of a similar character, in
   the conflagration of our book depository.

   It was under the impression that my manuscript was in existence that I
   asked and obtained liberty of the General Conference, in 1836, to have
   access to their journals and documents, to enable me to complete my
   design with the greater accuracy and more in detail. Of this privilege,
   however, I have not been able to make any use in the present volume, as
   I can find no journal of the proceedings of any General Conference of
   an earlier date than the year 1800. But should my life and health be
   spared to complete my work by adding a second volume, I trust I shall
   be enabled to enrich it with such extracts from those journals as will
   be found interesting to the general reader, and particularly to those
   to whom the affairs of the church may hereafter be committed.

   This latter period of our history abounds in materials, while that
   embraced in the present volume is, in some respects, comparatively
   barren, as but few of those who were instrumental in planting Methodism
   in this country have left particular records of their labors and
   sufferings, with which the page of history might be enriched. The
   sources, however, whence my information is derived, are of the most
   authentic character; and I trust it will not be devoid of interest and
   instruction to those who take pleasure in surveying the stones of our
   temple, and of comparing its present with its past condition, and of
   anticipating its future prospects and success. But though the materials
   for furnishing a very particular history of the early days of Methodism
   in these United States are comparatively sparse, when viewed in their
   scattered and insulated condition; yet when carefully collected and put
   together in consecutive order, they cannot fail to form an interesting
   and instructive medium of information; and more especially to those
   whose spiritual welfare is identified with this humble branch of the
   church of Jesus Christ. This I have endeavored to do, according to the
   best of my ability, and hope that whatever errors may be detected by
   the candid and critical reader, they will be attributed to their proper
   source, and pointed out with that spirit of friendliness which will
   ensure their correction.

   In speaking of the authorities on which I have relied for information
   in the compilation of this history, I feel it an act of justice to
   refer particularly to Lee's History of the Methodists, and to Bishop
   Asbury's Journal, principally because I think they have not been
   appreciated according to their worth.

   Though, considered as a whole, the Journal of Bishop Asbury is somewhat
   dry and monotonous, on account of its diurnal details of incidents of a
   private character; yet the historian of Methodism will find it a rich
   depository of important facts, illustrative of the rise and progress of
   the work of God in this country; and he will be both delighted and
   astonished at the immense labors and no little sufferings which this
   man of God performed and endured in this holy cause. With a view to do
   justice to his character, I have made Bishop Asbury the principal hero
   of the narrative, borrowing freely from his journals whatever might
   tend to throw light upon the subject and to present fairly and fully
   the active part which he took in the erection of this spiritual
   building. He was the father of Methodism in this country, and, as such,
   deserves a conspicuous place in that temple which his own hands
   contributed so effectually to erect, that his sons in the gospel and
   successors in the ministry may look to him as an exemplar for their
   imitation, and be stimulated and strengthened in their work.

   As to Lee's History, though it might have been more amplified in some
   particulars, and less minute in others, yet I consider it the most
   important narrative we have of early Methodism in these United States,
   and a most valuable textbook for the future historian. Next to Bishop
   Asbury, Mr. Lee traveled the most extensively through the country, and
   took an active and important part in the various transactions of the
   church, both in the Annual and General Conferences, as well as in the
   field of itinerancy, being a preacher of most indefatigable industry
   and steady perseverance. And, what enabled him to state the facts which
   he has recorded in his history with the greatest accuracy, he also kept
   a daily record of his travels, and marked with the eye of a keen and
   attentive observer whatever came within the circle of his observation.
   [1] Hence many parts of his narrative are made up, particularly those
   which relate to Methodism in some of the southern states and in New
   England, from his own knowledge and experience. On him, therefore, I
   have freely drawn for whatever might tend to answer my main design, in
   presenting to the reader a faithful history of the rise and progress of
   the Methodist Episcopal Church in these United States.

   In some instances, however, I have found, in collating them, that the
   printed Minutes and Mr. Lee, particularly in respect to numbers,
   disagree; and in such cases the preference has always been given to the
   public and authorized documents of the church.

   These remarks have been made in reference to these two authors, not
   with a view to disparage in the least degree others who have written
   upon the same subject, but chiefly, as before said, because it is
   believed that their respective merits have not been duly appreciated.
   And though Mr. Lee might have been led from some cause to withhold
   somewhat of that mood of praise which was justly due to Bishop Asbury,
   on account of which the latter was not well pleased with his history,
   yet impartial posterity will do justice to them both; and while is
   awarded to the first historian of American Methodism the merit of
   collecting and recording facts with fidelity, to Bishop Asbury will be
   given the praise of having contributed more largely than any one else
   in this country, and in his day, to the planting, watering, and pruning
   this tree of righteousness, as well as of having left a faithful record
   of such events as furnish the historian with materials for his work. To
   only a small part of this record had Mr. Lee access, as but a small
   portion of the journals was published until some years after his
   history was written; and hence the present history has the advantage of
   its predecessor in being able to incorporate in its pages much valuable
   information unknown to Mr. Lee. It has also enriched its pages with
   matter which, though it might have been in existence, was either beyond
   the reach of the writer, or was not deemed of sufficient importance to
   demand his attention.

   Having thus discharged what I consider an obligation to this greater
   and lesser light of Methodism, both of whom are now doubtlessly
   enjoying together the reward of their labors and sufferings in the
   cause of Christ, I proceed to say, that I hesitated for some time
   whether or not to refer in the margin to every authority I might quote,
   or on whom I might draw for the facts embodied in the history, or
   merely to make a general reference, as is done in the commencement of
   this preface. As such perpetual references would considerably swell the
   body of the work, without adding any thing to the stock of information,
   or to the authenticity of the facts detailed, it was thought most
   advisable to adopt the latter course. In most instances, however, when
   any important matter is introduced into the thread of the narrative, or
   the language of others has been used, due credit has been given by a
   reference to the proper authority. That the blessing of God may
   accompany this effort to trace his providence and grace in his
   watch-care over this branch of his church, and that it may continue to
   be showered abundantly upon his heritage, until his "dominion shall be
   from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the
   earth," the author would unite his fervent prayers with all those who
   love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.

   N. Bangs. New York, July 14, 1838.

   In presenting a history of this denomination of Christians to the
   reader, it seems proper to introduce it by a few historical sketches of
   the first settlements of the country, accompanied with an account of
   the civil and religious state of the people at the time Methodism was
   introduced.

   The discovery of America by Columbus in 1492, [2] awakened a spirit of
   bold and adventurous enterprise in Europe to which the minds of men
   heretofore had been strangers, and gave them an impulse in quite a new
   direction. The impetus thus given to European adventure received a
   fresh impulse by the discovery of the northern continent of the new
   world, by John and Sebastian Cabot, father and son, in 1497, only five
   years after the intrepid Columbus had solved the problem respecting the
   existence of a western hemisphere.

   Within the boundaries of these United States the first permanent
   settlement was made by the Spaniards; for though the Cabots were the
   first to discover the continent, and Columbus the first European who
   set foot on the islands bordering upon the American coast, it is
   manifest that no permanent settlement was made on the continent until
   it was effected by Melendez, who took possession of Florida September
   7, in 1565, in the name of his master, Philip II., king of Spain, and
   on the next day laid the foundation of the town of St. Augustine,
   deriving the name from the saint on whose day he came upon the coast.

   After many ineffectual attempts by Sir Walter Raleigh, a statesman
   uniting in himself the qualities of a philosopher, a Christian, and a
   hero, to found a settlement in Virginia, at a place now within the
   bounds of North Carolina, May 13, 1607, forty-one years after the
   foundation for St. Augustine was laid, the colony was founded at
   Jamestown, on James River; the river and town being named in honor of
   the sovereign, James I. of England, under whose auspices the enterprise
   was planned and executed. In the charter granted to this colony, it was
   stipulated that religion should be established according to the
   doctrines and ritual of the Church of England; and so it continued
   until after the independence of the United States was achieved.

   The next settlement was made by the "pilgrims," who, after a tedious
   voyage, and many perilous escapes, landed on the Plymouth Rock, on
   Monday, December 11, 1620. This was the foundation of the colonies of
   New England; and it was made by a company of bold, independent,
   religious adventurers, who fled from persecution in the old, to seek an
   asylum of religious liberty in the new world.

   From this small beginning the state of Massachusetts dates its origin.
   These pilgrims had imbibed the principles of Congregationalism, and
   hence this system became, in the growth of the colony, the established,
   and, in some respects, the intolerant religion of the land; and, with
   some mitigation in the eternal of its principles, which grew out of the
   improvements of the times and the progress of civil and religious
   liberty, remained so until some time after the revolution had effected
   the independence of these United States.

   In 1623 settlements were established on the banks of the Piscataqua
   River, and Portsmouth and Dover are among the oldest towns in New
   England. These were included in the grant made to those who afterward
   were instrumental in rearing the state of New Hampshire, in which the
   same religious principles predominated that characterized
   Massachusetts.

   In 1634 the colony of Maryland was settled by Mr. Calvert, a descendant
   of Lord Baltimore. May 27th of this year Mr. Calvert founded the
   village of St. Mary's, situated on the river of the same name. Though a
   Roman Catholic, yet, witnessing the intolerant spirit which reigned at
   home, and also pervaded to some extent the colonies in the new world,
   he was careful to provide for the free exercise of religion under his
   chartered rights: and thus a Roman Catholic, adhering to a system of
   religion justly considered the most intolerant of all the modifications
   of Christianity extant, had the honor of exhibiting to the savages and
   settlers of this western world the first example of religious freedom.
   And among all the colonies, none, except that of Rhode Island, were
   more strenuous asserters of civil and religious freedom, as exhibited
   in a truly republican government, than were the first settlers of
   Maryland.

   The next founder of a pure religious republic was Roger Williams. After
   suffering various persecutions from the magistrates of Massachusetts,
   for the bold, Scriptural, and rational manner in which he asserted and
   vindicated the principles of civil and religious liberty, he became a
   voluntary exile from the colony to which he had come to avoid religious
   persecution at home, and, in company with five companions, landed at a
   place in the wilderness which he called, as a pious memento of the
   goodness of God toward him and his fellow exiles, Providence, affirming
   in the fullness of his heart, "I desired it might be for shelter for
   persons distressed in conscience." This happened in June, 1636, was the
   beginning of the colony of Rhode Island, As it was a love of religious
   freedom which led to the settlement of the colony, so it has ever
   continued to be distinguished by this excellent trait of the Christian
   character.

   From the colony of Massachusetts, Connecticut received its first
   emigrants; and, in 1661, under the government of the estimable
   Winthrop, the new settlements of Hartford and New Haven, hitherto
   independent of each other, became united under one charter -- a charter
   which guarantied to them the rights of conscience and the blessings of
   civil liberty. As the settlers of this part of the country were the
   like hardy sons of the puritans with those who built up the Colonies of
   Massachusetts and Rhode Island, so they established for themselves
   similar regulations in respect to religion and morals, distinguished by
   a rigid adherence to the Scriptures, as interpreted and applied by the
   Congregationalists. Though less severe toward other sectarists than
   their elder brethren, yet they were exclusive in their views of church
   order and discipline, and so remained even after the tree of liberty
   had succeeded the pillar of royalty.

   As early as 1615, six years after Hudson entered the noble river which
   bears his name, a settlement was begun by the Dutch on Manhattan
   Island, (now New York,) and probably in the same year at Albany. The
   political and religious disputes with which the states of Holland were
   agitated at that time, very much retarded the progress of the infant
   settlement in this colony. These having in a measure subsided, soon
   after, through the agency of the Dutch West India Company, the work of
   colonization went forward more prosperously, and New York soon took its
   destined place among American colonies, as one of the stars which was
   to illuminate this Western hemisphere. As traffic, not religion, nor
   civil liberty, led to the first settlement of this portion of our
   country, it was not only slow in its progress, but indistinguishable
   for any other religious or civil character than that which pervaded the
   institutions of Holland. They were Protestants of the Calvinistic
   school, and aristocratic in their civil institutions. The progress of
   events, however, introduced various sects into the province, subject to
   those restrictions which the colonial legislature saw fit to impose.

   In 1631 the state of Delaware received its first emigrants from
   Holland, under the guardianship of De Vries, who established themselves
   near the site of Lewistown. These were under the influence of the same
   principles with those who had taken possession of New York. It
   afterward, in the year 1638, received an accession of emigrants from
   Sweden, who formed a settlement near the mouth of Christiana Creek. Of
   the religious state of this colony little is known, only that, when
   they sailed, they were provided with a religious teacher. The
   Reformation, however, had already taken firm hold of Sweden, and hence
   we may presume that Protestantism was early interwoven in their civil
   compact.

   In 1664 New Jersey received a separate and independent colonial
   existence. Before this period it had been claimed both by the Dutch,
   Swedes, and English, and the settlers were from each of these nations,
   most of whom were from the older colonies which had established on the
   continent. The charter by which the people held their rights contained
   the seeds civil and religious liberty, and all claimed the right of
   worshipping God according to the dictates of their consciences. What
   was called "West New Jersey," was first settled by the Quakers, who
   established themselves on the east bank of the Delaware River, and
   founded the town of Burlington in 1677.

   About the year 1660 North Carolina was colonized. It was first peopled
   by some adventurous emigrants from New England and Virginia, by whom,
   however, it was soon abandoned, on account of the rigorous measures
   adopted by the wealthy proprietors, to whom the country was granted by
   King Charles II. Unlike most of the other colonies, this appears to
   have been undertaken by its original proprietors for the sake of
   improving their fortune; but so widely had the seeds of civil and
   religious liberty been sown in the American soil, that it was extremely
   difficult, if indeed not impossible, to plant any colony here, with a
   prospect of success, without the nutriment of rational liberty.
   Accordingly, the proprietors were compelled to yield to the spirit of
   the times, and grant to the settlers of North Carolina the liberty of
   self-government; and, in the language of the historian of those times,
   "the shield of ecclesiastical oppression was swathed in independence."
   Then were they enabled to take a stand among the sister colonies, as
   another star in the bright constellation which began to shed a luster
   in this western hemisphere.

   In 1670 South Carolina was founded, and the first settlement was made
   on the banks of Ashley River, of which, however, nothing now remains to
   mark the spot, except the line of a moat which served for a defense
   against the natives. This colony, resisting the attempts which were
   made by the proprietaries to establish a despotic government, was
   established on the basis of republican liberty, by which the rights of
   conscience were guarantied to the colonists. The first permanent
   settlement was made on a neck of land called Oyster Point, now the city
   of Charleston, in 1673. The principles of religion were early
   incorporated in the civil institutions of South Carolina, granting to
   all sects the liberty of worshipping God in the manner most agreeable
   to themselves, and the colony was enriched by many of those pious and
   persecuted Huguenots, who fled from the intolerance of the bigoted
   Louis XIV., whose troubled conscience played easily into the hands of
   his stern and more bigoted advisers.

   The colony of Pennsylvania was first settled by Quakers, chiefly
   emigrants from West Jersey. But in 1682 William Penn himself arrived in
   the Delaware, and landed at Newcastle, on the western bank of that
   noble river, where he found a company of Swedes, Dutch, and English, to
   welcome his approach. In Chester he found a few of his honest
   followers. In the early part of the month of November he landed at the
   site of Philadelphia; and the next year he formed the grand treaty with
   the Indians beneath the shade of a lofty elm, by which they mutually
   bound themselves in a perpetual covenant of peace and friendship. As
   the emigrants who founded this colony were voluntary exiles from
   religious persecution in England, and were guided by an unconquerable
   love of liberty, they took care to guaranty to all the rights of
   conscience, and to guard, in the most sacred manner, the original
   interests of the aboriginals of the country. And it is due to historic
   truth to say, that William Penn surpassed all his competitors in his
   strict adherence to the terms of the treaty with the Indians, and in
   commanding their respect and confidence. The name which was given to
   the colony, Pennsylvania, (Penn's Woods,) indicated his own right in
   the soil, a right secured by a double purchase, first from his king,
   and secondly from the natives, while the name given to the city
   (Philadelphia, meaning brotherly love) served as a memento of the
   sacred principle which bound them together as a band of brothers. I
   need hardly add that this state has ever been distinguished for its
   stern adherence to those principles of liberty and equality by which it
   was first bound together.

   The colony of Georgia was established in 1733, under the patronage of
   General Oglethorpe, chiefly by members of the Church of England. In
   1736 the colony was visited by the Rev. Messrs. John and Charles
   Wesley, at the request of the trustees and governor of the colony, as
   missionaries to the Cherokee Indians. Here, also, the principles of
   civil and religious freedom were interwoven into their institutions,
   and have since guided their legislature in their civil enactments.

   Settlements were made in Vermont between the years 1744 and 1749. The
   oldest town, Bennington, was chartered in the latter year. In 1777, a
   constitution, plain and simple in its provisions, and the most
   democratic of any of the states in the union in its principles, was
   formed and adopted. Under this instrument the rights of conscience are
   secured alike; to all the citizens of the state, though the original
   settlers were principally of the Congregational order, being emigrants
   from the older New England states. Here, therefore, religious freedom
   is enjoyed without any legal restraint, and all denominations sit
   quietly "under their own vines and fig-trees," enjoying the fruits of
   their industry and the blessings of a gospel ministry.

   This account of the first settlement of our country has been given for
   the purpose of showing the materials out of which our republic was
   gradually framed; and though they were somewhat heterogeneous in their
   character, coming from different states and kingdoms of Europe,
   speaking a variety of languages, habituated to divers laws and usages,
   and professing different forms of Christianity, they were all strongly
   imbued with the principles of civil and religious liberty; and though
   some of the original projectors of the schemes of American colonization
   were actuated by motives of avarice, and the proprietaries of the lands
   were possessed strongly with aristocratic and baronial feelings and
   views, they were resisted by the colonists themselves as adopting
   principles and pursuing measures incompatible with their rights as
   freemen: while most of those who embarked in this grand enterprise were
   led to it from a dread of the persecution to which they were exposed at
   home, and a desire to obtain that liberty of conscience in religious
   matters which God, the Holy Scriptures, and the fitness of things
   proclaim and sanction as the birthright of all rational beings. Hence
   the cheerfulness with which they submitted to the disfranchisement of
   their rights as subjects of their respective governments in their own
   countries, the patience and perseverance with which they bore their
   privations and hardships "as strangers and pilgrims" in the howling
   wilderness," among savages, wolves, and tigers, as well as the facility
   and determination with which they resisted all encroachments upon their
   chartered rights as Christians and freemen, and finally succeeded in
   establishing their independence on a broad, and as we humbly hope, an
   enduring foundation.

   For though these people came from a land where monarchy reigned, and
   aristocracy triumphed over the liberties of the many, and some of them
   from countries where high-toned episcopacy, priding itself in its
   hereditary exclusive powers and privileges, had asserted the divinity
   of its origin; yet neither the monarchy nor the aristocracy, nor yet
   the episcopacy emigrated; neither a monarch, bishop, nor archbishop
   ever trod the North American soil! Enjoying their emoluments at home,
   and living in luxurious indolence on their own ample patrimonies in the
   bosom of their friends, protecting and being protected by each other,
   these hereditary lords of the soil and of the church were content to
   let the people seek an asylum from their oppression where alone they
   could enjoy those blessings for which they in vain sighed, and sought,
   and prayed in their own country. They were the people, therefore, and
   not their oppressive rulers, aided, indeed, in some instances, by a few
   high-minded and philanthropic spirits, who could claim kindred with
   "high blood" who emigrated to these shores. Galled and oppressed at
   home, they fled for refuge to this savage wilderness. And having thus
   fled, and established themselves in little independent communities,
   where they could enjoy the sweets of liberty, they were not to be
   deprived of this, their second life, without a struggle. And though in
   a few instances some of them transcended their original rights by an
   attempt to exclude others from participating in the privileges which
   they justly claimed for themselves, and thus exhibited an inconsistency
   to which human nature is remarkably prone, yet all these things were so
   overruled by a benignant Providence, that they eventuated, in
   conjunction with other causes which were at work simultaneously with
   these, and which lay deeply imbedded in the human heart, in the total
   overthrow of civil and religious despotism in this country, and the
   final establishment of a Scriptural and rational liberty, with which
   generations of men have been blessed, and which shall continue to pour
   its blessings upon generations yet unborn. Yes -- the undying truths
   which were elicited from mind by the settlement of America are destined
   to that immortality which shall live and flourish until time shall be
   no more. For though the fabric which they have contributed to raise
   should, by the folly and wickedness of men, be crumbled to the dust,
   these truths shall never die -- shall never be forgotten; but shall
   live in the page of history, in the song of the poet, and shall flash
   and blazon from the eloquent tongue of the statesman, the jurist, and
   the advocate of Christianity, so long as mind remains free to act. And
   more than all -- that Christianity which is destined to "cover the
   earth as the waters cover the great deep," shall diffuse these sacred
   truths over the wide earth, and transmit them, in all their freshness
   and luster, from generation to generation, until time shall resign its
   records to eternity!

   It cannot be accepted, nor even allowed, that I should attempt any
   thing like a history of the progress of the settlements of our
   continent in this brief introduction. Nothing more, therefore, is
   intended than such a cursory glance at things as is necessary to show
   the state of the country at the time Methodism was planted on these
   shores. A few general remarks, therefore, on the progress of the
   settlements and the general state of society only can be expected.

   It seems from the history of these times that, about the year 1686,
   attempts were made by the governor of New York to reduce all the
   colonies under his sway, and thus to introduce a despotism into the
   new, as hateful to its free-born inhabitants as was the tyranny from
   which they had fled in the old world; but the happy revolution which
   was effected in England in 1688, by the crowning of William, prince of
   Orange, king of Great Britain, was soon felt throughout the American
   colonies; and acting under the influence of this general pulsation of
   liberty, they resisted the tyranny of Andros and his party, proclaimed
   William and Mary, their Protestant sovereigns, and ceased not their
   efforts until they fully regained their chartered rights. Thus the
   spirit of liberty, which emigrated with the pilgrims and their
   compatriots, rose victorious over all opposition, and prepared for
   itself a habitation in these western wilds. At this memorable era,
   Providence had so ordered matters that the colonies hitherto claimed by
   several European powers were all united under the jurisdiction of Great
   Britain. At this time, the number of inhabitants in the several
   provinces is computed to be about 200,000, all imbued with the spirit
   of liberty and many of them actuated by the purest principles of
   Christianity. It is true, that as the number of inhabitants increased,
   and the means of enjoyment were multiplied, vicious indulgence
   corrupted the minds a morals of many; and the spirit of avarice,
   mingling in their councils, led to those infringements upon the rights
   of the aboriginal tribes which tended to provoke and irritate them,
   until acts of barbarous retaliation produced mutual hatred and
   sanguinary conflicts, often to the destruction of whole villages of
   white people, and the extermination of Indian tribes. These bloody
   wars, while they tended to an alienation of affection between the
   colonists and the savages, had a deleterious influence upon the
   interests of pure religion, as they must have awakened an animosity
   toward each other incompatible with that benign religion which breathes
   naught but good will toward mankind.

   It is but justice, however, to remark, that our pilgrim fathers were by
   no means unmindful of the moral and spiritual interests of the
   aborigines of the country. As early as the year 1646 measures were
   adopted by the general court of Massachusetts for the conversion of the
   natives; and the Rev John Eliot, justly styled the apostle to the
   Indians, undertook to carry the benevolent object into execution. Such
   was the success attending his labors, and those who aided and followed
   him, that in the several towns of New England there were, in 1696, no
   less than thirty Indian churches. In later times, namely, in 1744, the
   Indian settlement at the forks of the Delaware was visited by the pious
   and indefatigable Brainerd, whose evangelical labors were blessed to
   the conversion of numbers of these children of the desert. About the
   same time, the Moravians established missions among several of the
   North American Indians; and they have continued them with various
   degrees of success until this day. But though some vestiges of these
   primitive labors remain to the present time, the wars with the natives,
   particularly those with the famous chief King Philip, in 1675 and 1676,
   nearly extinguished the flame of missionary ardor which began to
   enlighten and warm the wigwams of the Indians, and spread a dark gloom
   over those bright prospects which had appeared in this western
   hemisphere; and as these children of the forests gradually receded from
   the sun of civilization into the trackless wilderness, they forgot the
   instructions of the Christian missionary, and plunged deeper and deeper
   into the mire of heathenism. Recent efforts, however, for their
   conversion give the Christian philanthropist hopes of their future
   reclamation to the blessings of Christianity and civilization.

   In respect to the general state of religion and morals in the colonies
   from the memorable revolution alluded to in 1688, it is not possible to
   enter into details, even were authentic documents at hand, in the
   limits allotted to this introduction. In the New England colonies,
   however, the institutions of the gospel were amply provided for by law;
   for those pious pilgrims who first peopled that part of the country,
   secured, by legal enactments, the ministry and ordinances of the gospel
   for every parish in the country; and though, in some instances, at
   particular times, they betrayed an intolerant spirit, particularly in
   Massachusetts, toward the Quakers and other sectarists, they generally
   exemplified a strong attachment to the interests of Christianity,
   preaching and enforcing its truths among the people. While, therefore,
   we may shed a tear over those weaknesses which led to the persecution
   of the Quakers, and those superstitions which dictated the sanguinary
   measures for the extirpation of witchcraft, by the people of
   Massachusetts, we must at the same time admire that inflexibility of
   purpose with which they maintained the institutions of the gospel, and
   the wisdom and zeal they displayed in the Christian education of their
   youth. Churches, school houses, ministers, and teachers were generally
   provided in every town and parish throughout the country. New England,
   therefore, may be considered, in some sense, as the nursery of religion
   and morals in these United States.

   Notwithstanding, however, those provisions in favor of the ordinances
   of Christianity, I believe it may be said, without any unjust
   disparagement of their character, that, at the time Methodism was
   introduced, experimental and practical religion was at a low ebb even
   in the New England provinces. Some portions of the country had, to be
   sure, been visited from time to time with revivals of religion; but it
   is an evidence of the low state of religion and morals to know that
   these had provoked powerful opposition, even from the very
   congregations among whom they commenced. What pious and enlightened
   mind does not feel emotions of sorrow at the recollection of the
   melancholy fact that the Rev. Jonathan Edwards was compelled to leave
   his ministerial charge at Northampton, because he so zealously enforced
   the doctrines and morality of the gospel upon the youth of his
   congregation! He, however, and those who acted with him in his gospel
   labors, were instrumental in reviving experimental godliness to a
   considerable extent in the congregational churches of New England.

   About the same time that these men of God were striving to revive the
   spirit of primitive Christianity in the hearts and lives of the people,
   the country was blessed with the labors of the pious and gifted
   Whitefield. His powerful voice was heard, in accents of evangelical
   warning, instruction, and entreaty, from Georgia, all along the coast,
   in the cities and villages through the New England provinces, to the
   extreme settlements of our northern and eastern frontiers. Nor did he
   speak in vain. The fire of evangelical love was kindled in many hearts
   in the several places which he visited. But he was like a blazing
   comet. Though he burned and blazed as he went, and left a trail of
   gospel light behind him, it did not long continue to shoot forth its
   scintillations. He organized no societies whose influence might be felt
   and diffused on the surrounding population. And though he excited some
   individuals, called in derision by their enemies "New Lights," to
   follow his track, they were "few and far between;" and having no
   concert of action, their lights soon became absorbed in the darkness
   which environed them.

   In Virginia, the oldest colony among the twelve original provinces, the
   English Church had a legal existence, and the clergy were under the
   jurisdiction of the bishop of London; and though other sects were
   tolerated, they were abridged of many of their rights, and were obliged
   to succumb in some respects to the privileged order. It appears,
   however, from the history of these days, that, at the time of which we
   are speaking, pure religion exerted but little influence on the great
   mass of the people, though doubtless there were here and there those
   who sighed in secret for the liberty of God's children, and looked
   forward to better days. A few Presbyterians, and a more numerous
   company of Baptists, were scattered among the people of Virginia, among
   whom we may presume that experimental and practical godliness was more
   generally exemplified than among the members of the established order;
   for, as to the clergy of the latter, it is acknowledged on all hands,
   that, with a very few exceptions, they were far gone from the spirit
   and practice of their original righteousness, as taught in the
   formularies of their church.

   In the middle provinces, comprehending New York, New Jersey, Delaware,
   Pennsylvania, and Maryland, there was a mixture of Churchmen, Dutch
   Reformed, Presbyterians, Baptists, Quakers, Lutherans, Roman Catholics,
   and some minor sects, exercising their peculiarities, and exerting
   various degrees of influence in favor of the general principles of
   Christianity. Among these, particularly the Presbyterians and Dutch
   Reformed, were to be found men of profound learning and fervent piety;
   but their influence was chiefly limited to the bounds of their
   respective congregations, and could not, therefore, extend to the great
   mass of the population. We may hope, however, that among the followers
   of Penn, the descendants of the Huguenots, the insulated societies of
   the Baptists, as well as the others we have enumerated, there were
   found those "who worshipped God in the Spirit, and had no confidence in
   the flesh." Still it must be said, in truth, that experimental and
   practical piety was confined to comparatively few, and that the great
   mass of the people were given up to their sports and plays, living
   without God in the world.

   In respect to the more southern colonies of the Carolinas and Georgia,
   though all sects were tolerated in the free exercise of their religious
   rites and ceremonies, the first settlers being chiefly of the
   established Church of England, their descendants generally cleaved to
   this form of Christianity, and were, like those in Virginia, generally
   immersed in the pleasures of the world. The persecutions endured by
   Messrs. John and Charles Wesley in Georgia, in 1736, are no slight
   proofs of the low state of religion in the colony of Georgia at that
   time. Nor have we any reason to believe that it was in higher repute in
   the Carolinas. And though the subsequent visits of Whitefield had
   awakened a spirit of religious inquiry in many minds in those, as well
   as in other parts of the country, as before stated, it had but an
   isolated influence; and for the want of coadjutors and successors to
   carry forward the work he was instrumental in beginning, by a regular
   organization and concentrated action, its effects had gradually
   disappeared, except in a few individual cases. His name, however, will
   ever be revered by the pious, as the founder of the Orphan House of
   Savannah, the Academy in Philadelphia, and as the instrument of the
   conversion of thousands of souls on this western continent. Had he
   followed in the track of Wesley, and adopted his enlarged views of the
   Divine goodness in the work of redemption by Jesus Christ, instead of
   the narrow views of Calvin respecting unconditional election and
   reprobation -- a doctrine which distinguished the Congregational,
   Presbyterian, Dutch Reformed, and most of the Baptist churches in this
   country -- he had achieved a victory in the name of his divine Master
   much more enduring and beneficial in its effects upon the interests of
   true religion. Let the history of the two men, and the results of their
   labors, decide the truth of this remark. Whitefield was "a burning and
   shining light," but "the people rejoiced in his light" for a short
   season only; while Wesley blazed in the symbolical heavens as a star of
   the first magnitude, collecting around him a cluster of inferior
   luminaries, forming a nebulae around which others have gathered, and
   still continue to gather, emitting various degrees of light and heat in
   the world around them. Whitefield followed Wesley to Savannah; and
   though neither of them continued his labors so as to produce much
   permanent effect, yet while the Orphan House has crumbled to ruins, and
   its decaying vestiges remain as a sorrowful memento of the benevolence
   of its founder, Methodism, as it was framed and fashioned by Wesley,
   has taken deep root in Savannah, and is thriving, under the nursing
   care of his sons in the gospel, throughout the surrounding country.

   These remarks, I trust, will be duly appreciated by the reader, while
   he reflects that at the time of which we are now speaking,
   notwithstanding those pious efforts, pure religion, holiness of heart
   and life, exerted but a feeble and limited influence upon those
   colonies; and that therefore a reformation was loudly called for to
   bring the people under the hallowing influence of the gospel of Jesus
   Christ.

   It will be seen by the foregoing sketch that the general state of
   things in this country about the middle of the eighteenth century, the
   time when the Wesleyan missionaries commenced their evangelical labors,
   was highly favorable to Christian effort. In some of the provinces the
   institutions of religion were established by law; and in all,
   Christianity was received as a revelation from God, and its ministers
   and ordinances were protected by the governments, and many a free
   toleration was allowed to all sects and denominations. And though
   infidelity in various shapes secretly pervaded the minds of many,
   insensibly shaking their faith in the authority of the sacred
   Scriptures, and thereby corrupted their minds and morals; yet
   Christianity, in some form, was the religion of the country -- the
   sacred Scriptures were circulated in the vernacular language of the
   people -- the Sabbath was considered as a holy day, consecrated to
   sacred purposes -- churches had been erected -- schools and colleges
   established -- the ministers of the gospel were settled in most of the
   parishes in the eastern and northern provinces, and in many of the
   middle and southern -- and the great mass of the people, though
   speaking divers languages, professed religion under some of its
   external forms and usages. Under these circumstances, it may be truly
   said, that this was a favorable soil for evangelical missionaries to
   enter upon the culture of, in the hope of returning with "joy, bringing
   their sheaves with them." The general bias was in favor of
   Christianity, so far at least as its external form was concerned; its
   doctrines were generally believed, its ministers honored, and in many
   places its ordinances respected.

   Those missionaries, therefore, who came here, were not in like
   circumstances with those who visit pagan nations. These have to begin
   every thing anew; they must fell the trees of pagan superstition, and
   break up the fallow ground of infidelity, and sow the seeds of
   Christianity often "in stony ground;" and if they are so favored as to
   deposit them "in good ground," it is after a long and laborious
   preparation. But here were a "people prepared for the Lord." "They were
   ripe for the harvest." The missionaries addressed themselves to a
   people generally who already believed their message, or at least
   believed in the authority of the Holy Scriptures, to which they
   appealed for the truth of what they delivered. If they demurred at all,
   it was at those peculiarities by which their conduct, their mode of
   life, their manner of preaching, and some of their doctrines were
   distinguished. What these were, we shall see hereafter. All these
   things were favorable, and promised the happiest results as the fruit
   of their toil.

   Another favorable state of things was, that the colonies were no
   longer, as they had been at some preceding times, subject to different
   European governments, though existing and acting under their separate
   colonial legislatures and local governors; they were all under the
   supreme jurisdiction of Great Britain, and its legislature possessed
   the ultimate control of their affairs, limited only by their respective
   charters. And, in this state of things, as the Wesleyan missionaries
   came from England, they came to their own brethren, preaching "Jesus
   and the resurrection" to their fellow subjects. And, moreover, as the
   principles of liberty had been diffused through these several
   communities, and were guarantied to them in their chartered rights, the
   gospel might "have free course run and be glorified." The missionaries,
   therefore had not to contend either with foreigners, "a people of a
   strange language," who might look upon them as intruders upon their
   soil, or with legal restraints imposed upon the rights of conscience;
   though in some of the provinces they were not allowed, in consequence
   of legal enactments, the full exercise of all their functions as
   ministers of the gospel, yet in others they were, and they could not be
   legally prevented in any from proclaiming the glad tidings of salvation
   in the name of Jesus Christ. This was a state of things hardly to be
   found at that time in any other part of the globe. Thus had God
   prepared the way for the spread of his gospel on this newly discovered
   continent.

   It must not be supposed, however, that all the people in the country
   were professedly religious. Though the above is an accurate account of
   the state of things in general, yet, as before remarked, infidelity had
   insinuated itself into the minds of some, while many others, perhaps
   the great majority, had their religion yet to choose. As experimental
   and practical godliness was not generally enforced upon the
   congregations where the ministry and ordinances of Christianity were
   established, a dry morality, and a lifeless attention to external rites
   and ceremonies among professors of religion, were substituted for that
   fervor of piety and joy in the Holy Ghost by which holy Christians are
   distinguished. This state of things accounts for the general opposition
   which was manifested to the pure doctrines of Christ, particularly to
   justification by faith in Christ, and the witness and fruits of the
   Spirit, when they were proclaimed by the first Methodist preachers.

   But in giving a true and full state of the country, there is another
   thing which must not be forgotten -- I allude to slavery. It is well
   known to all, that, at an early period of our colonial history, the
   slave trade made its way, in all its detestable character, to our
   shores; and at the time of which we are now speaking, notwithstanding
   the resistance made to it, in its first appearance by the colonial
   legislatures, it had become interwoven in nearly every civil compact in
   the country. This had introduced an exotic, uncongenial population into
   our country, not only differing in color from the mass of the people,
   but bowing in servitude to the masters of the soil. It will be found in
   the sequel that the Wesleyan missionaries were among the first, if
   indeed not the very first, who turned their attention especially and
   directly to the spiritual and moral improvement of these people; and it
   is on this account chiefly that this subject is introduced in this
   place. And that it may be clearly understood, it is necessary that we
   should glance at the manner in which slavery was introduced, and
   entailed as a fatal legacy upon many of the inhabitants of these United
   States.

   That slavery existed among all ancient nations, the Jews, the Grecians,
   the Romans, the Africans, and all the barbarous tribes of men, is a
   fact too well known to need proof. Indeed, it is said by one of our
   late historians, that "slavery and the slave trade are older than the
   records of human society." "They are," says he, "found to have existed
   wherever the savage hunter began to assume the habits of pastoral and
   agricultural life; and, with the exception of Australasia, they have
   extended to every portion of the globe. [3]

   The same historian remarks, and quotes Herodotus as authority, --
   "Negro slavery is not an invention of the white man. As Greeks enslaved
   Greeks, as the Hebrew often consented to make the Hebrew his absolute
   lord, as Anglo-Saxons trafficked in Anglo-Saxons, so the Negro race
   enslaved its own brethren. The oldest accounts of the land of the
   Negroes, like the glimmering traditions of Egypt and Phoenicia, of
   Greece and of Rome, bear witness to the existence of domestic slavery,
   and the caravans of dealers in Negro slaves. The oldest Greek historian
   commemorates the traffic. Negro slaves were seen in classic Greece, and
   were known at Rome and in the Roman empire."

   Is it strange, then, that it should find its way to America? But how
   came it here? In modern times the Portuguese, about the year 1441,
   having visited the western coast of Africa, commenced the nefarious
   practice of decoying away the inhabitants for slaves. The practice once
   begun, the cupidity of avarice found means to continue and increase it.
   To make the trade as lucrative as possible, the slavers visited every
   port to which they could have access to make merchandise of the souls
   and bodies of men. This brought them to America. And though at first
   strongly resisted by the colonists, it was sanctioned by the supreme
   authority; and even Elizabeth descended from her royalty to become a
   partner in the traffic, for the sake of sharing the profits. It was in
   1645 that the first cargo of Negro slaves was brought into Boston; and
   though the voice of the Puritans was loudly raised against it as an
   evil to be dreaded and denounced, and ordered them to be "restored at
   the public charge," yet it was afterward permitted, and gradually
   assumed the shape of a regular traffic. It finally spread through all
   the colonies, more particularly the southern, though in Virginia it was
   strenuously resisted, and at first only admitted conditionally, the
   servant standing to his master in the relation of debtor, bound to work
   until he had discharged the obligation he was under to him for the
   price at which he had been purchased. But Negro slavery was ultimately
   riveted on the colonies with all the rigor the laws could enforce. Thus
   did the profits arising from the traffic and the labors of the slave
   combine with the policy of the royal government at home, to sanction a
   practice which has entailed upon our country an evil of such tremendous
   magnitude, as perhaps centuries of the most wise and cautious measures
   may not wholly remove.

   These remarks have been made for the purpose of showing,
    1. That slavery was not at first the fault of the colonists, but of
       the governments of the old world, though it is manifest that having
       been once introduced, its familiarity and its gains at last
       rendered it desirable, and, as they finally came to believe,
       necessary, its necessity being inferred from its utility in a
       pecuniary point of view.
    2. That considering the circumstances under which it originated, it
       was at first more the misfortune than the fault of the American
       people that slavery became interwoven into their civil
       institutions.
    3. For the purpose of showing the actual state of things at the time
       when Methodism set up its banners on these western shores, that the
       evils with which it had to contend, as well as its advantages, may
       be fully known and properly considered.

   Having given this introductory sketch of the first settlements of the
   provinces, and their subsequent progress in civil and religious
   matters, together with a short view of the general state of things
   until about the middle of the 18th century, we will now proceed to the
   main object of this history, which is, to trace the rise and progress
   of Methodism in this country. In doing this, we shall divide the
   subject into the following periods:

   i. From its introduction into the city of New York, in 1766, to the
   first conference in 1773.

   ii. From this period to the organization of the societies into a Church
   in 1784.

   iii. From this time to the first regular general conference in 1792.

   iv. From this to the first delegated general conference in 1812.

   v. From that period until the present time. [1838]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2] The reader is doubtless aware that the first discovery of America
   has been attributed to the Norwegians, by whom Iceland was peopled. It
   seems indeed indisputable, especially from the documents which have
   been recently brought to light by "The Royal Society of Northern
   Antiquarians," that as early as 986 Greenland was discovered by a
   company of Norwegians from Iceland, and a settlement effected there by
   emigrants from that place. And it is equally true, by the same
   authority, that these persons, assisted by some of their countrymen
   from Norway, from the year 1000 and onward to near the close of the
   13th century, discovered various portions of the coast of North
   America, from Nova Scotia along down as far south as the Chesapeake
   Bay, if not even as Florida. It seems also that landings were made at a
   number of places, and a traffic carried on for short seasons with the
   natives. But it is equally certain that no permanent settlements were
   made, nor any right acquired to the soil from the aboriginal
   inhabitants. Whether Columbus had any knowledge of these facts, as some
   contend, or not, it is certain that he struck out a new path for the
   discovery of this western world, inasmuch as the Norwegians came across
   from one of the most northern kingdoms of Europe Iceland, and probably
   never dreamed of a connection between America and the south of Europe
   in the direction taken by Columbus. Nor were there, so far as has been
   discovered, the least traces of civilization on the northern coast of
   America when taken possession of by Europeans in the 16th century. The
   adventures of Columbus, therefore, and his immediate followers, had all
   the characteristics of original enterprise, and of priority in
   discovery, as much so as if the eye of civilized man had never before
   beheld the western continent.

    FROM THE YEAR 1766 TO THE YEAR 1792
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 1

    A a short account of the origin of Methodism in England -- Of the Rev. John
    Wesley -- His parentage, and first labor in the ministry.

   Twenty-seven years had elapsed from the time Mr. Wesley formed the
   first Methodist society in London, when a few Methodist emigrants from
   Ireland formed themselves into a society in the city of New York. But
   before we proceed to detail the circumstances under which this society
   was formed, and the subsequent events in the history of Methodism in
   this country, it seems proper that we should trace its origin in
   England, and more especially notice some particulars in the life and
   labors of that great man of God, the Rev. John Wesley, who was the
   chief instrument in beginning and carrying forward this extensive
   revival of true religion. Without this, any history of Methodism would
   be incomplete.

   The Rev. John Wesley was the second son of Samuel and Susanna Wesley,
   and was born at Epworth, in Lincolnshire, June 17th, 1703, O. S. He
   received his first lessons of instruction from his mother, a woman
   admirably qualified for the right education and training of her
   children. His father was a learned and pious minister of the
   establishment, and his mother was not less strenuously attached than he
   to the doctrines, usages, and formularies of that church. In these
   principles the son was educated, and the impressions made upon his mind
   under the management of the skillful teachings of such a mother, and
   the guidance and example of such a father, were never wholly erased,
   but became the guiding principles, with some few deviations from strict
   conformity to the establishment, of his subsequent life.

   At the age of eleven, in the year 1714, he was dismissed from the
   immediate care of his mother, and placed at the Charter House, under
   the able tuition of Dr. Walker, with whom, on account of his sobriety
   and diligence in his studies, he became a great favorite.

   At the age of sixteen he entered college at Oxford, and soon gave
   evidence, by his progress in his studies, of that acuteness of
   intellect, and sternness of virtue, by which he was afterward so
   eminently distinguished. When about twenty years of age he began to
   think seriously of entering into holy orders; and accordingly, after
   consulting his father and mother, turned his attention to those books
   and studies which were best adapted to give him the needful
   information.

   In September, 1725, he was ordained a deacon, and the following year
   elected fellow of Lincoln College. He took his degree in February,
   1727, and in 1728 was ordained a priest or presbyter in the Church of
   England. In 1729 he attended the meetings of a small society which had
   been formed at Oxford, in which were included his brother Charles and
   Mr. Morgan, for the purpose of assisting each other in their studies,
   and of consulting how they might employ their time to the best
   advantage. The same year he became a tutor in the college, received
   pupils, and presided as moderator in the disputations six times a week.

   It was about this time, the society above named having attracted some
   attention from the regularity of their lives, and their efforts to do
   good to others, that some of the wits at Oxford applied to the members
   the name of Methodists, a name by which John Wesley and his followers
   have ever since been distinguished. Whatever might have suggested this
   name to those who first used it in this application, whether in
   reference to an ancient sect of physicians, or to some Christians so
   called in the early days of the Reformation, it is no small
   recommendation of those who were thus designated at this time, that it
   was applied to them as descriptive of the rigidness with which they
   adhered to method in their studies, the regularity of their deportment,
   and their diligence in visiting the sick and the poor, with a view to
   relieve their wants, and impart to them religious instruction. Happy
   will it be for those who are still designated by the same descriptive
   appellation, if they shall continue to exemplify the same virtues, and
   the same pursuit after intellectual and spiritual improvement. It was
   not long after that the holiness of their lives gained for them a still
   more worthy epithet, namely, The Holy Club, and finally, on account of
   the frequency with which they commemorated the sufferings of their
   divine Master, that of Sacramentarians. These things, however, were so
   far from damping the ardor of their zeal, that they served only to
   reanimate them, with renewed courage, and stimulate them to
   perseverance in the discharge of their duties. In all these works John
   Wesley was the distinguished leader.

   Passing over the events of his life which occurred during the remainder
   of the days he spent at Oxford, in which he continued to be
   characterized by his wisdom in counsel, his attachment to the Church,
   and his charity to the poor and the ignorant, I come to notice his
   missionary voyage to America. In the latter part of the year 1735;
   through the solicitation of General Oglethorpe, and the trustees for
   the new colony of Georgia, he consented to deny himself of the many
   advantages he enjoyed in the seclusion of Oxford, and to embark, in
   company with his brother Charles, on a missionary enterprise for that
   colony. Here they landed on the 6th of February, 1736. Of his fidelity
   in the cause of his Master here, the privations he suffered, and the
   good he was instrumental in doing, I need not speak in this sketch, as
   a full detail of them may be seen in his biography, by Mr. Moore and
   others. After remaining about one year and a half, baffled in his pious
   design of preaching the gospel to the heathen, misrepresented and
   persecuted by those who ought to have been his friends and defenders,
   and seeing no prospect of succeeding in his main design, which was to
   convert the Indians, he took leave of the Georgians, and arrived in
   London February 3, 1738.

   This voyage had its benefits. On his passage over to America, there
   being several Moravians on board, he had frequent opportunities of
   conversing with them, by which he learned "the way of God,"
   particularly the way of justification through faith in Jesus Christ,
   and the necessity and privilege of the witness and fruits of the Holy
   Spirit "more perfectly." On his return to England he renewed his
   acquaintance with some of the Moravian ministers; and after much
   conversation, in which his objections to the above doctrines were fully
   obviated by appeals to Scripture and the experience of God's children,
   he says, "About a quarter before nine," (in the evening,) "while one
   was reading Luther's preface to the Epistle to the Romans, where he was
   describing the change which God works in the heart through faith in
   Christ, I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ,
   Christ alone for salvation: and an assurance was given me that he had
   taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and
   death." About the same time his brother Charles was made a partaker of
   the like blessing.

   Mr. Wesley had, from the time he had been convinced of the necessity of
   justification by faith in Christ, preached the doctrine to the people;
   but now since he was made a partaker of this great blessing, he began
   more earnestly and understandingly to proclaim aloud to sinners the
   "things he had seen and felt." As he had been much edified by the
   conversation of the Moravians, with a view to strengthen himself in the
   faith, he made a journey to Germany, visited Hernhuth, their principle
   settlement, attended their meetings, and had free and full
   conversations with their most eminent men on the subject of
   experimental and practical godliness, by which his mind was much
   enlightened, and his heart established in the doctrine of justification
   by faith, and in the enjoyment of the witness and fruit of the Holy
   Spirit. After thus holding communion with these saints for some time,
   he returned to London in September, 1738.

   Having no other plan of operations than simply to get and communicate
   all the good in his power, after his return from Germany, he began
   preaching more powerfully than ever the grand doctrines of Jesus
   Christ; and so pointed were his appeals to the consciences of the
   unregenerate, and earnest his exhortations to repentance, that the
   "offence of the cross" soon began to manifest itself, and he was given
   to understand that he could no longer preach in this, and then in
   another church. He then, in imitation of his brother Whitefield, went
   into the open fields, and Kensington Commons, and other places, were
   made to echo with the joyful sound of salvation by faith in the name of
   Jesus. Success crowned his efforts. Those who were awakened under his
   searching appeals to a sense of their danger came to him for advice;
   and as their number continually increased, he found it expedient to
   form them into a society; and in 1743 he drew up those rules which have
   continued to be the general rules [4] of the societies, both in Europe
   and America, to this day, with one small exception.

   This was the first regular organization of societies by Mr. Wesley, and
   the formation of classes soon followed. Among those who were converted
   under his ministry, and joined his societies, were some young men "full
   of faith and of the Holy Ghost," to whom it became manifest a
   "dispensation of the gospel was committed;" and though in consequence
   of his strong attachment to the established order of things in his
   church, he submitted with great reluctance to employ them, yet being
   convinced they were called of God to this work, he dare not refuse the
   help thus afforded him by the Head of the church. Hence originated the
   employment of lay-preachers, an irregularity for which Mr. Wesley
   suffered much persecution. As the work increased under his, his
   brother's, and the labors of those preachers, to avoid confusion it
   became necessary to have a more digested plan of proceeding: this gave
   rise to calling the preachers together for conference, the first of
   which was held in London in June, 1744. From this time the work went on
   more rapidly than ever, and it soon spread throughout different parts
   of England and Wales.

   It is by no means necessary, in this sketch of the rise and progress of
   Methodism in Great Britain, to enter into farther details; and even
   thus much has been given that the reader might see the root of that
   tree, the branches of which have since extended over this western
   hemisphere, and become a shelter for so many of the weary sons of
   apostate Adam, "who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set
   before them." Suffice it therefore to say, that Mr. Wesley continued
   his evangelical labors, assisted occasionally by a few pious clergymen
   of the establishment, among whom the most efficient was his brother
   Charles, and afterward Mr. Fletcher, and those whom God raised up from
   among his sons in the gospel, extending their labors to Ireland and
   Scotland, until, in 1766, a way opened for the introduction of this
   same gospel into America. At this time Methodism, under the skilful
   hand of the Wesleys, had received a regular shape, was known as a
   distinct denomination, though still adhering to the Church of England,
   and had adopted such a method of carrying forward its operations as to
   become a compact system, every part of which moved in obedience to him
   who, under God, had brought it into existence. I shall conclude this
   chapter with a few reflections.
    1. It appears that the founder of Methodism was fully qualified for,
       and regularly called to his work.
    2. That the work was eminently the work of God.
    3. That Mr. Wesley was led into it without any previously digested
       plan of his own, but was conducted forward by the indications of
       divine Providence and grace, in the adoption of those measures, and
       the selection of those means, which arose out of the circumstances
       in which he was placed, and, which were evidently sanctioned of God
       for the spiritual good of mankind.
    4. That he was so far from setting out in his career with a view of
       putting himself at the head of a sect, that his only object was to
       do good, to revive primitive Christianity in the church of which he
       was a minister, in conformity to the letter and spirit of its own
       articles of faith and formuluries of devotion. But that being
       opposed and persecuted by the carnal clergy of the establishment,
       as well as by Catholics and dissenters, he was forced either to
       disobey God by relinquishing his work, or to become the leader of a
       distinct sect. He wisely chose the latter, for which thousands will
       bless God in time and eternity.

CHAPTER 2

    From the introduction of Methodism into the city of New York, in 1766, to
    the landing of the first missionaries in 1769.

   The introduction of Methodism into these United States was attended
   with those circumstances which show how great events often result from
   comparatively insignificant causes. Like the entire structure of
   Methodism, it originated without any foresight of man, without any
   previous design in the instruments to bring about such an event, and
   without any of those previously devised plans which generally mark all
   human enterprises. And yet it will doubtlessly mark an era in the
   history of our country, on which its future historians will stop and
   pause, as having a bearing, it is hoped for good, on its destinies. The
   spirit of discontent had already begun to vent itself in low murmurings
   and secret whispers against the supposed wrongs and oppressions of the
   mother country, when Methodism commenced its leavening influence on the
   minds of a few obscure persons in the city of New York. And although it
   formed no part of the design of its disciples to enter into the
   political speculations of the day, nor to intermeddle with the civil
   affairs of the country, yet it is thought that its extensive spread in
   this country, the hallowing influence it has exerted on society in
   uniting in one compact body so many members, through the medium of an
   itinerant ministry, interchanging from north to south, and from east to
   west, has contributed not a little to the union and prosperity of the
   nation.

   Let us, however, hasten to lay before the reader the facts and
   circumstances indicated at the head of this chapter.

   We have already stated, that the first Methodist society was
   established in the city of New York, in the year 1766. This was done by
   a small number of pious emigrants from Ireland, who, previously to
   their removal to this [country], had been members of a Methodist
   society in their own country. Among their number was Mr. Philip Embury,
   a local preacher. Though they had been attached to Wesleyan Methodism
   at home, it appears that, on their arrival here, they came very near
   making "shipwreck of faith and a good conscience." They were strangers
   in a strange land; and not finding any pious acquaintances with whom
   they could associate, they gradually lost their relish for divine
   things, and sunk away into the spirit of the world. In this state of
   lukewarmness and worldly mindedness they were found the next year on
   the arrival of another family from Ireland, among whom was a pious
   "mother in Israel," to whose zeal in the cause of God they were all
   indebted for the revival of the spirit of piety among them. Soon after
   her arrival, she ascertained that those who had preceded her had so far
   departed from their "first love" as to be mingling in the frivolities
   and sinful amusements of life. The knowledge of this painful fact
   aroused her indignation, and with a zeal which deserves commemoration,
   she suddenly entered, the room where they were assembled, seized the
   pack of cards with which they were playing, and threw them into the
   fire. Having thus unceremoniously destroyed their "playthings," she
   addressed herself to them in language of expostulation; and turning to
   Mr. Embury, she said, "You must preach to us, or we shall all go to
   hell together, and God will require our blood at your hands!" This
   pointed appeal had its intended effect, in awaking his attention to the
   perilousness of their condition. Yet, as if to excuse himself from the
   performance of an obvious duty, he tremblingly replied, "I cannot
   preach, for I have neither a house nor congregation." "Preach in your
   own house first, and to our own company," was the reply. Feeling the
   responsibility of his situation, and not being able any longer to
   resist the importunities of his reprover, he consented to comply with
   her request; and accordingly preached his first sermon, "in his own
   hired house," to five persons only. This, it is believed, was the first
   Methodist sermon ever preached in America.

   As they continued to assemble together for mutual edification, so their
   numbers were gradually increased, and they were much comforted and
   strengthened by "exhorting one another daily." They were too few in
   number, however, to attract much public attention, and for some time
   they remained in apparent obscurity. As might be expected, they
   gradually gained more and more notoriety; for the name of WESLEY, as
   well as of METHODIST, was not unknown in this country; and the very
   reproach which was heaped upon him and his followers gave him and them
   a notoriety which otherwise they might never have gained.
   Notwithstanding, therefore, the fewness of their number, and the
   secluded manner in which they held their meetings, they soon found that
   they must either procure a larger place, or preclude many from their
   meetings who were desirous to attend. They accordingly rented a room in
   the neighborhood of larger dimensions, the expense of which was
   defrayed by voluntary contributions. Here they assembled for mutual
   edification, Mr. Embury continuing to lead their devotions, and to
   expound to them the word of God. An event happened about this time
   which tended to bring them more into notice, and to attract a greater
   number of hearers. This was the arrival of Captain Webb, an officer in
   the British army, at that time stationed in Albany, in the state of New
   York. He had been brought to the "knowledge of salvation by the
   remission of sins," under the ministry of Mr. Wesley, in Bristol,
   England, about the year 1765; and though a military character, such was
   his love for immortal souls, that he was constrained to declare unto
   them the loving-kindness of God. This he did, first to his
   fellow-soldiers, and afterward to all who were willing to hear him. His
   first appearance as a stranger among the "little flock" in New York, in
   his military costume, gave them no little uneasiness, as they were
   fearful that he had come to "spy out their liberties," or to interrupt
   them in their meetings; but when they saw him kneel in prayer, and
   otherwise participate with them in their worship, their fears subsided;
   and on forming a more intimate acquaintance, they found that Captain
   Webb had "partaken of like precious faith" with themselves. He was
   accordingly invited to preach. The novelty of his appearance in the
   badges of a military officer excited no little surprise. This, together
   with the energy with which he spoke in the name of the Lord, drew many
   to the place of worship, and the room where they assembled soon became
   too small to accommodate all who wished to hear. But what greatly
   encouraged them in their "work of faith and labor of love" was, that
   sinners were awakened and converted to God, and added to the society.
   These, continuing to walk in the "fellowship of the Holy Ghost," were
   much strengthened and comforted, while others who beheld their godly
   conversation were convinced of the power and excellence of their
   religion.

   To accommodate all who wished to hear, they next hired a rigging loft
   in William Street, and fitted it up for a place of public worship. Here
   they assembled for a considerable time, edified in faith and holiness
   by the labors of Mr. Embury, who was occasionally assisted by Capt.
   Webb. While the society were thus going forward in their work in New
   York, Capt. Webb made excursions upon Long Island, and even went as far
   as Philadelphia, preaching, wherever he could find an opening, the
   gospel of the Son of God, and success attended his labors, many being
   awakened to a sense of their sinfulness through his pointed ministry,
   and brought to the knowledge of the truth. In consequence of the
   accession of numbers to the society, and hearers of the word, the
   rigging loft also became too small, and hence they began to consult
   together on the propriety of building a house of worship.

   But, for the accomplishment of this pious undertaking, many
   difficulties were to be encountered. The members of the society were
   yet few in number and most of them of the poorer class, and of course
   had but a limited acquaintance and influence in the community. For some
   time a painful suspense kept them undetermined which way to act. But
   while all were deliberating on the most suitable means to be adopted to
   accomplish an object so desirable, and even necessary for their
   continued prosperity, an elderly lady, [5] one of the Irish emigrants
   before mentioned, while fervently engaged in prayer for direction in
   this important enterprise, received, with inexpressible sweetness and
   power, this answer -- "I, the Lord, will do it." At the same time a
   plan was presented to her mind, which, on being submitted to the
   society, was generally approved of, and finally adopted. They proceeded
   to issue a subscription paper, waited on the mayor of the city and
   other opulent citizens, to whom they explained their object, and from
   them received such liberal donations as greatly encouraged them to
   proceed in their undertaking. Thus countenanced by their fellow
   citizens, they succeeded in purchasing several lots in John Street, on
   which they erected a house of worship, 80 feet in length and 42 in
   breadth calling it, from respect to the venerable founder of Methodism,
   WESLEY CHAPEL. Such, however, were the municipal relations in the
   province at that time, that they were not allowed to consecrate the
   house exclusively for divine worship; they therefore devoted a small
   portion of it to domestic purposes. This was the first meeting house
   ever erected by a Methodist congregation in America -- and this was
   built in the year 1768, and the first sermon was preached in it October
   30, 1768, by Mr. Embury.

   While this house was in progress, they felt the necessity of procuring
   the services of a more competent preacher. Though Mr. Embury was a
   zealous and good man, yet he had but moderate abilities as a preacher.
   He was obliged, moreover, to work with his own hands to support himself
   and family, and therefore could not devote his labors exclusively to
   the work of the ministry. To supply this deficiency the society wisely
   determined to apply to Mr. Wesley for help; and the following letter,
   signed T. T., will show the general state of the society, and the
   earnestness with which they solicited the requisite aid.

   "New York, 11 April, 1768

   "Rev. and Very Dear Sir, -- I intended writing to you for several weeks
   past; but a few of us had a very material transaction in view. I
   therefore postponed writing until I could give you a particular account
   thereof; this was the purchasing of ground for building a preaching
   house upon, which, by the blessing of God, we have now concluded. But
   before I proceed, I shall give you a short account of the state of
   religion in this city. By the best intelligence I can collect, there
   was little either of the form or power of it until Mr. Whitefield came
   over, thirty years ago; and even after his first and second visits,
   there appeared but little fruit of his labors. But during his visit
   fourteen or fifteen years ago, there was a considerable shaking among
   the dry bones. Divers were savingly converted; and this work was much
   increased in his last journey, about fourteen years since, when his
   words were really like a hammer and like a fire. Most part of the
   adults were stirred up: great numbers pricked to the heart, and, by a
   judgment of charity, several found peace and joy in believing. The
   consequence of this work was, churches were crowded, and subscriptions
   raised for building new ones. Mr. Whitefield's example provoked most of
   the ministers to a much greater degree of earnestness. And by the
   multitudes of people, old and young, rich and poor, flocking to the
   churches, religion became an honorable profession. There was now no
   outward cross to be taken up therein. Nay, a person who could not speak
   about the grace of God, and the new birth, was esteemed unfit for
   genteel company. But in a while, instead of pressing forward, and
   growing in grace, (as he exhorted them,) the generality were pleading
   for the remains of sin and the necessity of being in darkness. They
   esteemed their opinions as the very essentials of Christianity, and
   regarded not holiness, either of heart or life.

   The above appears to me to be a genuine account of the state of
   religion in New York eighteen months ago, when it pleased God to rouse
   up Mr. Embury to employ his talent (which for several years had been
   hid, as it were, in a napkin) by calling sinners to repentance, and
   exhorting believers to let their light shine before men. He spoke at
   first only in his own house. A few were soon collected together and
   joined into a little society, chiefly his own countrymen, Irish
   Germans. In about three months after, brother White and brother Souse,
   from Dublin, joined them. They then rented an empty room in their
   neighborhood, which was in the most infamous street in the city,
   adjoining the barracks. For some time few thought it worth their while
   to hear: but God so ordered it by his providence, that about fourteen
   months ago Captain Webb, barrack-master at Albany, (who was converted
   three years since at Bristol,) found them out, and preached in his
   regimentals. The novelty of a man preaching in a scarlet coat soon
   brought greater numbers to hear than the room could contain. But his
   doctrines were quite new to the hearers; for he told them point-blank,
   that all their knowledge and religion were not worth a rush, unless
   their sins were forgiven, and they had "the witness of God's Spirit
   with theirs that they were the children of God." This strange doctrine,
   with some peculiarities in his person, made him soon taken notice of;
   and obliged the little society to look out for a larger house to preach
   in. They soon found a place that had been built for a rigging house,
   sixty feet in length and eighteen in breadth.

   "About this period Mr. Webb, whose wife's relations lived at Jamaica,
   Long Island, took a house in that neighborhood, and began to preach in
   his own house, and several other places on Long Island. Within six
   months, about twenty-four persons received justifying grace, nearly
   half of them whites, -- the rest Negroes. While Mr. Webb was (to borrow
   his own phrase) felling trees on Long Island,' brother Embury was
   exhorting all who attended on Thursday evenings, and Sundays, morning
   and evening, at the rigging house, to flee from the wrath to come. His
   hearers began to increase, and some gave heed to his report, about the
   time the gracious providence of God brought me safe to New York, after
   a very favorable passage of six weeks from Plymouth. It was the 26th
   day of October last, when I arrived, recommended to a person for
   lodging; I inquired of my host (who was a very religious man) if any
   Methodists were in New York; he answered that there was one Captain
   Webb, a strange sort of man, who lived on Long Island, and who
   sometimes preached at one Embury's, at the rigging house. In a few days
   I found out Embury. I soon found of what spirit he was, and that he was
   personally acquainted with you and your doctrines, and that he had been
   a helper in Ireland. He had formed two classes, one of the men, and the
   other of the women, but had never met the society apart from the
   congregation, although there were six or seven men, and as many women,
   who had a clear sense of their acceptance in the Beloved.

   You will not wonder at my being agreeably surprised in meeting with a
   few here who have been and desire again to be in connection with you.
   God only knows the weight of affliction I felt on leaving my native
   country. But I have reason now to conclude God intended all for my
   good. Ever since I left London, my load has been removed, and I have
   found a cheerfulness in being banished from all near and dear to me,
   and I made a new covenant with my God, that I would go to the utmost
   parts of the earth, provided he would raise up a people with whom I
   might join in his praise. On the great deep I found a more earnest
   desire to be united with the people of God than ever before. I made a
   resolution that God's people should be my people, and their God my God:
   and, bless his holy name, I have since experienced more heartfelt
   happiness than ever thought it possible to have on this side eternity.
   All anxious care about my dear wife and children is taken away. I
   cannot assist them, but I daily and hourly commend them to God in
   prayer, and I know he hears my prayers, by an answer of love in my
   heart. I find power daily to devote myself unto him; and I find power
   also to overcome sin. If any uneasiness at all affects me, it is
   because I can speak so little of so good a God.

   "Mr. Embury lately has been more zealous than formerly; the consequence
   of which is, that he is more lively in preaching; and his gifts as well
   as graces are much increased. Great numbers of serious persons came to
   hear God's word as for their lives; and their numbers increased so fast
   that our house for six weeks past would not contain half the people.

   "We had some consultations how to remedy this inconvenience, and Mr.
   Embury proposed renting a small lot of ground for twenty-one years, and
   to exert our utmost endeavors to build a wooden tabernacle; a piece of
   ground was proposed; the ground rent was agreed for, and the lease was
   to be executed in a few days. We, however, in the meantime, had several
   days for fasting and prayer, for the direction of God and his blessing
   on our proceedings; and Providence opened such a door as we had no
   expectation of. A young man, a sincere Christian and constant hearer,
   though not joined in society, not giving any thing toward this house,
   offered ten pounds to buy a lot of ground, went of his own accord to a
   lady who had two lots to sell, on one of which there is a house that
   rents for eighteen pounds per annum. He found the purchase money of the
   two lots was six hundred pounds, which she was willing should remain in
   the purchasers' possession, on good security. We called once more on
   God for his direction, and resolved to purchase the whole. There are
   eight of us who are joint purchasers: among whom Mr. Webb and Mr.
   Lupton are men of property. I was determined the house should be on the
   sa me footing as the orphan house at Newcastle, and others in England;
   but as we were ignorant how to draw the deeds, we purchased for us and
   our heirs, until a copy of the writing is sent us from England, which
   we desire may be sent by the first opportunity.

   "Before we began to talk of building, the devil and his children were
   very peaceable: but since this affair took place many ministers have
   cursed us in the name of the Lord, and labored with all their might to
   stop their congregations from assisting us. But He that sitteth in the
   highest laughed them to scorn! Many have broken through, and given
   their friendly assistance. We have collected above one hundred pounds
   more than our own contributions; and have reason to hope in the whole
   we shall have two hundred pounds: but the house will cost four hundred
   pounds more, so that unless God is pleased to raise up friends we shall
   yet be at a loss. I believe Mr. Webb and Mr. Lupton will borrow or
   advance two hundred pounds, rather than the building should not go
   forward; but the interest of money here is a great burden -- being
   seven per cent Some of our brethren proposed writing to you for a
   collection in England: but I was averse to this, as I well know our
   friends there are overburdened already. Yet so far I would earnestly
   beg: if you would intimate our circumstances to particular persons of
   ability, perhaps God would open their hearts to assist this infant
   society, and contribute to the first preaching house on the original
   Methodist plan in all America, (excepting Mr. Whitefield's orphan house
   in Georgia:) but I shall write no more on this subject.

   "There is another point far more material, and in which I must
   importune your assistance, not only in my own name, but also in the
   name of the whole society. We want an able and experienced preacher;
   one who has both gifts and grace necessary for the work. God has not,
   indeed, despised the day of small things. There is a real work of grace
   begun in many hearts by the preaching of Mr. Webb and Mr. Embury; but
   although they are both useful, and their hearts in the work, they want
   many qualifications for such an undertaking; and the progress of the
   gospel here depends much upon the qualifications of preachers.

   In regard to a preacher, if possible we must have a man of wisdom, of
   sound faith, and a good disciplinarian: one whose heart and soul are in
   the work; and I doubt not but by the goodness of God such a flame will
   be soon kindled as would never stop until it reached the great South
   Sea. We may make many shifts to evade temporal inconveniences; but,
   cannot purchase such a preacher as I have described. Dear sir, I
   entreat you, for the good of thousands, to use your utmost endeavors to
   send one over. I would advise him to take shipping at Bristol,
   Liverpool, or Dublin, in the month of July, or early in August: by
   embarking at this season he will have fine weather in his passage, and
   probably arrive here in the month of September. He will see before
   winter what progress the gospel has made.

   "With respect to money for the payment of the preachers' passage over,
   if they could not procure it, we would sell our coats and shirts to
   procure it for them.

   "I most earnestly beg an interest in your prayers, and trust you, and
   many of our brethren, will not forget the church in this wilderness.

   "I remain with sincere esteem, Rev. and dear sir,

   "Your very affectionate brother and servant,

   "T. T."

   Mr. Wesley refers to these circumstances in his Works, and says,
   "Tuesday, August 1, our conference began at Leeds. On Thursday, I
   mentioned the case of our brethren in New York. For some years past,
   several of our brethren from England and Ireland, (and some of them
   preachers,) had settled in North America, and had in various places
   formed societies, particularly in Philadelphia and New York. The
   society at New York had lately built a commodious preaching house, and
   now desired our help, being in great want of money, but much more of
   preachers. Two of our preachers, Richard Boardman and Joseph Pillmore,
   willingly offered themselves for the service; by whom we determined to
   send over fifty pounds as a token of our brotherly love." These
   brethren, who were the first regular itinerant Methodist preachers who
   visited this country, landed at Gloucester Point, six miles below
   Philadelphia, October 24, 1769. They immediately entered upon their
   Master's work, Mr. Boardman taking his station in New York, and Mr.
   Pillmore in Philadelphia, occasionally changing with each other, and
   sometimes making short excursions into the country. They found a people
   ripe for the gospel; for in all places whither they went, multitudes
   flocked to hear the word, and many were induced to seek an interest in
   the Lord Jesus Christ.

   Having thus traced the commencement of this work of God in the city of
   New York, where the seeds of Methodism were first planted in American
   soil, we will turn our attention to another part of the Lord's
   vineyard, where similar efforts were made with the like success. About
   the same time that Mr. Embury was laying the foundation for this
   spiritual edifice in New York, and Captain Webb was, to use his own
   language, "felling the trees on Long Island," and some other places,
   Mr. Robert Strawbridge, another local preacher from Ireland, came over
   and settled in Frederick county, in Maryland; and being a pious and
   zealous man, he commenced preaching in his own house, and other private
   houses, the doctrines of Jesus Christ as held and taught by Mr. Wesley.
   His word was attended "with the power and demonstration of the Spirit,"
   and very soon a society was collected of such as "desired to flee the
   wrath to come, and to be saved from their sins." Mr. Strawbridge
   succeeded in building a house of worship, near Pipe Greek, in Maryland,
   called the Log Meeting House, in which he continued for some time to
   preach to the people, and to watch over the society he had formed. The
   following anecdote is related of this good man by Mr. Garrettson: --
   "He came to the house of a gentleman near where I lived to stay all
   night. I had never heard him preach; but as I had a great desire to be
   in company with a person who had caused so much talk in the country, I
   went over and sat and heard him converse until nearly midnight; and
   when I retired it was with these thoughts -- I have never spent a few
   hours so agreeably in my life. He spent most of the time in explaining
   Scripture, and in giving interesting anecdotes; and perhaps one of them
   will do to relate here A congregation came together in a certain place,
   and a gentleman who was hearing thought that the preacher had directed
   his whole sermon to him, and he retired home after the sermon in
   disgust. However, he concluded to hear him once more, and hide himself
   behind the people, so that the preacher should not see him; it was the
   old story -- his character was delineated. He retired dejected; but
   concluded that possibly the preacher saw him, and said, I will try him
   once more;' he did so, and hid himself behind the door. The preacher
   took for his text, And a man shall be as a hiding place, &c.' In the
   midst of the sermon, the preacher cried out, Sinner, come from your
   scouting hole!' The poor fellow came forward, looked the preacher in
   the face, and said, You are a wizard, and the devil is in you; I will
   hear you no more.'"

   Thus was at foundation laid by these two men of God, [Philip Embury and
   Robert Strawbridge] who probably came to America for other purposes
   than that of preaching the gospel, for a permanent work of God in this
   country; and it was the Macedonian cry which was sent to England by
   these people, and more especially those in New York, which moved Mr.
   Wesley to send them, in answer to their petition, the help they so much
   needed.

   the contributions of the people, and I felt, in so doing, an
   inexpressible pleasure." God abundantly rewarded him in after life,

CHAPTER 3

    From the arrival of the first missionaries in 1769 to the first conference
    in 1773.

   We have already seen that Messrs. Boardman and Pillmore, after their
   arrival, entered upon their respective fields of labor with ardor and
   success. After spending some time in Philadelphia, hearing of the
   labors of Mr. Strawbridge in Maryland, Mr. Pillmore paid him a visit,
   and endeavored to strengthen his hands in the Lord. After preaching to
   the people in that part of Maryland, and rejoicing in the good which
   had been effected by the labors of Mr. Strawbridge, he visited some
   parts of Virginia and North Carolina, where he preached with success,
   and formed some societies. Here he also found the people exceedingly
   attentive to the word of God, and manifesting a cordial feeling for
   those who preached it. After laboring a short time in those parts of
   the country, where he was much encouraged at the appearance of things,
   he returned to Philadelphia. The following letter, which he addressed
   to Mr. Wesley, will show the state of things here. The letter is dated,

   "Philadelphia, Oct. 31, 1769.

   "Rev. Sir, -- By the blessing of God we are safely arrived here, after
   a tedious passage of nine weeks. We were not a little surprised to find
   Captain Webb in town, a society of about one hundred members, who
   desire to be in close connection with you. This is the Lord's doings,
   and it is marvellous in our eyes.'

   I have preached several times, and the people flock to hear in
   multitudes. Sunday evening I went out upon the common. I had the stage
   appointed for the horse race for my pulpit, and I think between four
   and five thousand hearers, who heard with attention still as night.
   Blessed be God for field preaching. When I began to talk of preaching
   at 5 o'clock in the morning, the people thought it would not answer in
   America however, I resolved to try, and I had a very good congregation.

   "There seems to be a great and effectual door opening in this country,
   and I hope many souls will be gathered in. The people in general like
   to hear the word, and seem to have ideas of salvation by grace."

   The above letter shows the good effects of Captain Webb's labor's in
   Philadelphia, for it seems he had been instrumental in collecting not
   less than one hundred souls into the society previously to the arrival
   of Mr. Pillmore.

   On coming to New York, Mr. Boardman found the society in a flourishing
   state under the labors of Mr. Embury. Mr. Boardman was a man of
   respectable talents as a preacher, of great simplicity and godly
   sincerity, and he entered upon his evangelical labors with a fair
   prospect of success, the people flocking to hear him with the utmost
   eagerness and attention. At this early stage of their labors in the
   ministry they commenced an interchange with each other, Mr. Pillmore
   coming to New York and Mr. Boardman going to Philadelphia. Having
   entered upon the charge of the society in New York, and making a fair
   trial among the people, on the 24th of April, 1770, he transmitted to
   Mr. Wesley the following account of the state of things in this city:

   "Our house contains about seventeen hundred people. About a third part
   of those who attend get in; the rest are glad to hear without. There
   appears such a willingness in the Americans to hear the word as I never
   saw before. They have no preaching in some parts of the back
   settlements. I doubt not but an effectual door will be opened among
   them. O! may the Most High now give his Son the heathen for his
   inheritance. The number of the blacks that attend the preaching affects
   me much."

   In addition to these two eminent men, who were sent over to this
   country by Mr. Wesley, Mr. Robert Williams, who had been a local
   preacher in England, and Mr. John King, from London, came over, not
   under the direction of Mr. Wesley, but on their own account; the
   former, however, having a permit from him to preach under the direction
   of the missionaries. Mr. Williams labored as a local preacher with
   acceptance among the people; and with considerable success, and so also
   did Mr. King, after being duly examined and licensed by Mr. Pillmore.
   Both of these brethren so demeaned themselves as ministers of the
   gospel, that they were afterward received into the traveling ministry,
   as may be seen by reference to the minutes of conference for the year
   1773.

   From the encouraging representations of the condition and disposition
   of the people in America, which were transmitted to Mr. Wesley, he was
   induced to adopt measures to furnish them with additional help in their
   important work. Accordingly, the next year, 1771, Mr. Francis Asbury
   and Mr. Richard Wright, having volunteered their services, were
   dismissed under the blessing of God for the help of their brethren in
   America. As Mr. Asbury bore such a conspicuous part in the extensive
   revival of pure religion, it seems proper that we should give some
   account of his birth and education, his call to the ministry, and the
   motives which led him to embark in this holy enterprise.

   According to a notice in his journal, vol. ii, p.133, it appears that
   he was born in England, in the parish of Harrodsworth, near the foot of
   Hampstead Bridge, about four miles from Birmingham, in Staffordshire,
   on the 20th or 21st of August, 1745. His parents were people in common
   life, but were remarkable for honesty and industry, so that they
   procured a competency for themselves and family. They had but two
   children; a son and daughter, and the latter dying in infancy, left
   Francis the only son of his mother, and the only child of his parents.
   It seems that they lived in a very dark time and place as respects
   spiritual and divine things.

   He was early sent to school, and though he took delight in learning to
   read, particularly his Bible, yet he met with such cruel treatment from
   his master as to contract such a dread of him, that he preferred almost
   any thing to his school. He accordingly, when about thirteen years of
   age, left the school and went to a trade, in which he continued as an
   apprentice about six years and a half, during which time he was treated
   with great kindness and attention. The following is his own account of
   his conversion, of his call to, and entrance upon, the Christian
   ministry:

   "Soon after I entered on that business, God sent a pious man, not a
   Methodist, into our neighborhood, and my mother invited him to our
   house; by his conversation and prayers I was awakened before I was
   fourteen years of age. It was now easy and pleasing to leave my
   company, and I began to pray morning and evening, being drawn by the
   cords of love, as with the bands of a man. I soon left our blind
   priest, and went to West-Bromwick church: here I heard Ryland,
   Stillingfleet, Talbot, Bagnall, Mansfield, Hawes, and Venn, great
   names, and esteemed gospel ministers. I became very serious, reading a
   great deal -- Whitefield and Cennick's Sermons, and every good book I
   could meet with. It was not long before I began to inquire of my mother
   who, where, what were the Methodists; she gave me a favorable account,
   and directed me to a person that could take me to Wednesbury to hear
   them. I soon found this was not the church -- but it was better. The
   people were so devout -- men and women kneeling down, saying, Amen. --
   Now, behold! they were singing hymns -- sweet sound! Why, strange to
   tell! the preacher had no prayer-book, and yet he prayed wonderfully!
   What was yet more extraordinary, the man took his text, and had no
   sermon-book: thought I, this is wonderful indeed! It is certainly a
   strange way, but the best way. He talked about confidence, assurance,
   &c. -- of which all my flights and hopes fell short. I had no deep
   convictions, nor had I committed any deep known sins. At one sermon,
   some time after, my companion was powerfully wrought on: I was
   exceedingly grieved that I could not weep like him; yet I knew myself
   to be in a state of unbelief. On a certain time, when we were praying
   in my father's barn, I believe the Lord pardoned my sins, and justified
   my soul; but my companions reasoned me out of this belief, saying, Mr.
   Mather said a believer was as happy as if he was in heaven.' I thought
   I was not as happy as I would be there, and gave up my confidence, and
   that for months; yet I was happy; free from guilt and fear, and had
   power over sin, and felt great inward joy. After this we met for
   reading and prayer, and had large and good meetings, and were much
   persecuted, until the persons at whose houses we held them were afraid,
   and they were discontinued. I then held meetings frequently at my
   father's house, exhorting the people there, as also at Sutton-Cofields,
   and several souls professed to find peace through my labors. I met
   class a while at Bromwick Heath, and met in band at Wednesbury. I had
   preached some months before I publicly appeared in the Methodist
   meeting houses; when my labors became more public and extensive, some
   were amazed, not knowing how I had exercised elsewhere. Behold me now a
   local preacher; the humble and willing servant of any and of every
   preacher that called on me by night or by day, being ready, with hasty
   steps, to go far and wide to do good, visiting Derbyshire,
   Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire, and indeed almost every
   place within my reach for the sake of precious souls; preaching,
   generally, three, four, and five times a week, and at the same time
   pursuing my calling. I think when I was between twenty-one and
   twenty-two years of age I gave myself up to God and his work, after
   acting as a local preacher near the space of five years: it is now the
   19th of July, 1792. I have been laboring for God and souls about thirty
   years, or upward.

   "Some time after I had obtained a clear witness of my acceptance with
   God, the Lord showed me, in the heat of youth and youthful blood, the
   evil of my heart: for a short time I enjoyed, as I thought, the pure
   and perfect love of God; but this happy frame did not long continue,
   although at seasons I was greatly blessed. While I was a traveling
   preacher in England, I was much tempted, finding myself exceedingly
   ignorant of almost every thing a minister of the gospel ought to know.
   How I came to America, and the events which have happened since my
   Journal will show."

   In the first volume of his Journal he records the following facts the
   exercises of his mind, and his final determination to visit this
   country:

   "On the 7th of August, 1771, the conference began at Bristol, in
   England. Before this, I had felt for half a year strong intimations in
   my mind that I should visit America; which I laid before the Lord,
   being unwilling to do my own will, or to run before I was sent. During
   this time my trials were very great, which the Lord, I believe,
   permitted to prove and try me, in order to prepare me for future
   usefulness. At the conference it was proposed that some preachers
   should go over to the American continent. I spoke my mind, and made a
   offer of myself. It was accepted by Mr. Wesley and others, who judged
   that I had a call. From Bristol I went home to acquaint my parents with
   my great undertaking, which I opened in as gentle a manner as possible.
   Though it was grievous to flesh and blood, they consented let me go. My
   mother is one of tenderest parents in the world: but I believe she was
   blessed in the present instance with divine assistance to part with me.
   I visited most of my friends in Staffordshire, Warwickshire, and
   Gloucestershire, and felt much life and power among them. Several of
   our meetings were indeed held in the Spirit and life of God. Many of my
   friends were struck with wonder when they heard of my going; but none
   opened their mouths against it, hoping it was of God. Some wished that
   their situation would allow them to go with me.

   "I returned to Bristol in the latter end of August, where Richard
   Wright was waiting for me, to sail in a few days for Philadelphia. When
   I came to Bristol I had not one penny of money: but the Lord soon
   opened the hearts of friends, who supplied me with clothes and ten
   pounds: thus I found by experience that the Lord will provide for those
   who trust in him.

   "On Wednesday, September 2, we set sail from a port near Bristol; and
   having a good wind soon passed the channel. For three days I was very
   ill with the sea-sickness: and no sickness I ever knew was equal to it.
   The captain behaved well to us. On the Lord's day, September 8, brother
   W. preached a sermon on deck, and all the crew gave attention.

   "Thursday 12th. I will set down a few things that lie on my mind.
   Whither am I going? To the new world. What to do? To gain honor? No, if
   I know my own heart. To get money? No, I am going to live to God, and
   to bring others so to do. In America there has been a work of God: some
   moving first among the Friends, but in time it declined: likewise by
   the Presbyterians, but among them also it declined. The people God owns
   in England are the Methodists. The doctrines they preach, and the
   discipline they enforce, are, I believe, the purest of any people now
   in the world. The Lord has greatly blessed these doctrines and this
   discipline in the three kingdoms: they must therefore be pleasing to
   him. If God does not acknowledge me in America, I will soon, return to
   England. I know my views are upright now -- may they never be
   otherwise!"

   They landed in Philadelphia, October 7, 1771, and were most cordially
   received by the people. They immediately repaired to the church, and
   heard a sermon from Mr. Pillmore, whom they found at his station and in
   his work.

   "The people," says Mr. Asbury, "looked on us with pleasure, hardly
   knowing how to show their love sufficiently, bidding us welcome with
   fervent affection; and receiving us as angels of God. O that we may
   walk worthy of the vocation wherewith we are called. When I came near
   the American shore my very heart melted within me: to think from whence
   I came, where I was going, and what I was going about. But I felt my
   mind open to the people, and my tongue loosed to speak. I feel that God
   is here, and find plenty of all I need."

   As the printed minutes extend no farther back than 1773, we have no
   other account of the numbers in society at this time than what is found
   in Mr. Asbury's Journal, vol. iii, p. 109, where he says there were
   "about three hundred in New York, two hundred and fifty in
   Philadelphia, and a few in New Jersey;" but there must have been some
   also in Maryland, as the fruit of the labors of Mr. Strawbridge,
   probably the whole number was not less than six hundred.

   After spending a few days in Philadelphia, delivering his testimony for
   God, Mr. Asbury left there for the city of New York, where he arrived
   on the 12th, of November, and on the 13th preached to the people from 1
   Cor. ii, 2, "I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus
   Christ, and him crucified." "I approved much," says he, "of the spirit
   of the people; they were loving and serious; there appeared also in
   some a love of discipline. Though I was unwilling to go to York so
   soon, I believe it is all well; and I still hope I am in the order of
   God. My friend B." (meaning doubtless Mr. Boardman, the preacher) "is a
   kind, loving, worthy man, truly amiable and entertaining, and of a
   child-like temper." Respecting himself he says, "I purpose to be given
   up to God more and more, day by day."

   It seems that previously to the arrival of Mr. Asbury the preachers had
   confined their labors chiefly to the cities. This plan of operations
   did not suit the enlarged desires of Mr. Asbury. He alludes to this
   circumstance in the following words: "At present I am dissatisfied, and
   judge that we are to be shut up in the cities this winter. My brethren
   seem unwilling to leave the cities, but I think I shall show them the
   way." -- "I am come over with an upright intention, and through the
   grace of God I will make it appear, and am determined that no man shall
   bias me with soft words and fair speeches." -- "Whomsoever I please or
   displease, I will be faithful to God, to the people, and to my own
   soul." This determination I believe he steadily and perseveringly kept
   to the end of his life. And in pursuance of the design he had thus
   formed, he made an excursion to West Farms and to Westchester,
   preaching with great freedom and power the "gospel of the kingdom." He
   spent the winter alternately in the city and country, extending his
   labors to New Rochelle, to Rye, and sometimes visiting Staten Island;
   and he had the unspeakable pleasure of being hailed by the people in
   general as a messenger of God, though sometimes persecuted and opposed
   by the rabble.

   The consequence of thus extending his labors into the country towns and
   villages, was the giving a new and more vigorous impulse to religious
   zeal, and of calling the attention of multitudes to the gospel message,
   who otherwise might never have heard it. This example of Mr. Asbury had
   its effect upon the other preachers, and in the latter part of the year
   some of them visited the provinces of Delaware and Maryland, and
   preached on the western and eastern shore of Maryland. Two private
   members of the society raised up by Mr. Strawbridge, were the first
   Methodists who visited Kent county, on the eastern shore of Maryland.
   They came to one John Randal's, conversed and prayed with the family,
   and left behind them some salutary impressions. This created a desire
   for Methodist preaching; and shortly after, Mr. Strawbridge himself
   paid them a visit, and preached to them the gospel of Christ. He was
   followed by Robert Williams; and in December following, 1772, Mr.
   Asbury went into Kent county. "Before preaching," he says, "one Mr. R.,
   a Church minister, came to me and desired to know who I was, and
   whether I was licensed. I told him who I was. He spoke great swelling
   words, and said he had authority over the people, and was charged with
   the care of their souls. He also said that I could not, and should not
   preach: and if I did, he should proceed against me according to law. I
   let him know that I came to preach, and preach I would; and farther
   asked him if he had authority to bind the consciences of the people, or
   if he was a justice of the peace; and told him I thought he had nothing
   to do with me. He charged me with making a schism. I told him that I
   did not draw the people from the Church, and asked him if his church
   was then open. He then said that I hindered the people from their work.
   I asked him if fairs and horse races did not hinder them; and farther
   told him that I came to help him. He said he had not hired me for an
   assistant, and did not want my help. I told him if there were no
   swearers or other sinners, he was sufficient. But, said he, What do you
   come for? I replied, To turn sinners to God. He said, Cannot I do that
   as well as you? I told him that I had authority from God. He then
   laughed at me, and said, You are a fine fellow indeed! I told him I did
   not do this to invalidate his authority: and also gave him to
   understand that I did not wish to dispute with him; but he said he had
   business with me, and came into the house in a great rage. I began to
   preach, and urged the people to repent and turn from all their
   transgressions, so iniquity should not prove their ruin. After
   preaching the parson went out, and told the people they did wrong in
   coming to hear me, and said I spoke against learning, whereas I only
   spoke to this purpose -- when a man turned from all sin he would adorn
   every character in life, both in church and state."

   This quotation is given as a specimen of the sort of opposition the
   first Methodist preachers had to encounter in that part of the country.
   The clergy in general had but a name to live, while they were dead to
   spiritual and divine things, and were therefore unprepared to receive
   the true messengers of peace and mercy. Through the persevering labors
   of Mr. Asbury and others associated with him, a gracious work was
   commenced on this peninsula, which has terminated in great good to the
   souls of thousands.

   In the month of April of this year Mr. Pillmore, following the example
   of Mr. Asbury, traveled south, through Maryland and Virginia, as far as
   Norfolk, preaching in all places where he could find an opening; and in
   the beginning of 1773 he penetrated into the lower counties of
   Virginia, and thence through North Carolina to Charleston, in South
   Carolina, nor did he stop till he reached Savannah, in Georgia,
   visiting the Orphan House, which had been erected by Mr. Whitefield as
   early as 1740. We have no particular account of these visits, but it is
   presumed that they were rendered a blessing to many. He returned
   northwardly some time the next spring. Mr. Boardman made a tour north
   as far as Boston, where he preached and formed a small society, and
   then returned to his station in New York.

   In the early part of this year Mr. Robert Williams visited Norfolk, in
   Virginia. Without giving any public notice, he stood on the steps of
   the court house and began to sing, which soon collected a number of
   people around him, to whom he preached, not, however, without
   considerable interruption from some disorderly persons. They seemed to
   think, indeed, that the preacher was mad, for as they had not been
   accustomed to hear a minister pronounce the words hell and devil in his
   sermons, from the frequent use Mr. Williams made of these terms they
   concluded he was a wicked, swearing preacher, though in some parts of
   his discourse they thought he preached the gospel. From this first
   impression of the man, no one was inclined to invite him to his house.
   But on hearing him a second time at the same place, they so far altered
   their opinion respecting his sanity that he was invited to their
   houses; and not long after, a society was formed in Norfolk, which has
   continued to this day, gradually increasing in number and usefulness.

   October 10, 1772, Mr. Asbury says he received a letter from Mr. Wesley,
   in which he required a strict attention to the general rules, and also
   appointing him general assistant. To understand this designation it is
   necessary to observe, that Mr. Wesley, being, under God, the founder of
   the societies, was considered the head of the whole body, both in
   Europe and America, and the one having charge of a circuit under him
   was styled his assistant, and those under this assistant were styled
   helpers. In appointing, therefore, Mr. Asbury as general assistant, he
   constituted him the head of all the preachers and societies in America,
   with power to station the preachers, &c., under the general direction
   of Mr. Wesley himself.

   As yet no regular conference of preachers had been convened, but they
   regulated their matters at the quarterly meetings. At one of these
   meetings, which was held Tuesday, December 23, on the western shore of
   Maryland, Mr. Asbury, after preaching on the duties of the ministry,
   says they "proceeded to their temporal business, and considered the
   following propositions:
    1. What are our collections? We found them sufficient to defray our
       expenses.
    2. How are the preachers stationed? It is regretted that, in answering
       this question, Mr. Asbury gives the initials only of the names of
       the preachers who received their stations. He says, "Brother S. (by
       which we suppose he means, Strawbridge,) "and brother O." (who?)
       "in Frederick county," "brother K." (King?) "brother W."
       (Williams?) "and J. R" (who?) "on the other side of the Bay; and
       myself in Baltimore.
    3. Shall we be strict in our society meetings, and not admit
       strangers? Agreed.
    4. Shall we drop preaching in the day-time through the week? Not
       agreed to.
    5. Will the people be contented without our administering the
       sacraments. John King was neuter; brother Strawbridge pleaded much
       for the ordinances, and so did the people, who seemed to be much
       biased by him. I told them I would not agree to it at that time,
       and insisted on our abiding by our rules.
    6. Shall we make collections weekly to pay the preachers' board and
       expenses? This was not agreed to. We then inquired into the moral
       character of the preachers and exhorters."

   Though Mr. Asbury took his station in Baltimore, where he was most
   cordially received by the people, he by no means confined his labors to
   that city, but extended them into the towns and villages in the
   vicinity, everywhere proclaiming in the ears of the people the joyful
   news of salvation by grace, through faith in the Lord Jesus. In
   consequence of thus enlarging the boundaries of their labors -- for the
   other preachers followed the apostolic example set them by Mr. Asbury
   -- the work of God spread among the people, so that considerable
   additions were made to the societies. This, though the numbers were not
   yet taken, appears evident from Mr. Asbury's Journal, where he speaks
   of meeting and regulating the classes in a number of places.

   It was remarked above, that most of the clergy in the southern
   provinces were destitute of experimental godliness; and therefore,
   instead of helping forward the work of God as promoted by the Methodist
   preachers, they either manifested indifference, "caring for none of
   these things," or otherwise set themselves in opposition to it. To
   this, however, there were some honorable exceptions. Among these was
   the Rev. Mr. Jarratt, of Virginia, under whose preaching there had been
   a considerable revival of religion, particularly at a place called
   White Oak. In imitation of Mr. Wesley and his preachers, Mr. Jarratt
   formed those who were awakened to a sense of their danger into a
   society, that they might assist each other in working out their
   salvation. The good effects of these meetings were so apparent, in
   producing "the fruits of good living," that they were encouraged, and
   the revival went on gradually, chiefly under the labors of Mr. Jarratt,
   from 1771 to 1773, spreading from fifty to sixty miles "in the region
   round about."

   In the beginning of the year 1773, Mr. Robert Williams visited
   Petersburg, in Virginia, and preached with success, first in the town,
   and then through various parts of the country. He was a plain, pointed
   preacher, indefatigable in his labors, and many were awakened and
   converted to God through his public and private exhortations; and it is
   said that the name of Robert Williams was long remembered by many who
   were his spiritual children in those parts. He and other Methodist
   preachers who visited Virginia were kindly received by Mr. Jarratt, and
   they greatly assisted each other in promoting the work of the Lord.

   In the meantime Mr. Asbury continued his itinerating labors very
   extensively through the country, devoting all his time and attention to
   the work of the ministry. Nor did he labor in vain. Many sinners were
   brought to the knowledge of the truth, and new societies were
   established in various places.

   Mr. Wesley was considered the father of the societies both in Europe
   and America. To him, therefore, they looked for direction in all
   important matters, and especially for a regular supply of preachers --
   for as yet none had been raised in this country who had entered the
   itinerant ranks. That he might understand the true state of things for
   himself, and thereby be competent to act with the more discretion and
   efficiency, it seems that he had manifested a desire to visit America;
   for Mr. Asbury says, under date of May 6, 1773, "This day a letter from
   Mr. Wesley came to hand, dated March 2, in which he informs me that the
   time for his visiting America is not yet, being detained by the
   building of a new chapel." Soon after this, however, Mr. Asbury was
   cheered by the arrival of two missionaries, Messrs. Thomas Rankin and
   George Shadford. They landed in Philadelphia on the third day of June,
   1773, and immediately entered upon their work. As Mr. Rankin had
   traveled several years longer than Mr. Asbury, Mr. Wesley appointed him
   the general assistant of the societies in America.

    FROM THE FIRST CONFERENCE IN 1773, TO THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH IN 1784
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 1

    From the conference of 1773 to the commencement of the war in 1776

   We have seen that up to this period no regular conference had been
   held, but that the business had been transacted at their quarterly
   meetings. On the arrival of Mr. Rankin with powers to act as general
   assistant, a conference was convened in the city of Philadelphia, July
   4, 1773. This being the first regular conference ever held in America,
   I think it proper to give the entire minutes as they were taken down
   and afterward published.

   "The following queries were proposed to every preacher: --

   "1. Ought not the authority of Mr. Wesley and that conference to extend
   to the preachers and people in America, as well as in Great Britain and
   Ireland?

   Answer Yes.

   2. Ought not the doctrine and discipline of the Methodists, as
   contained in the minutes, to be the sole rule of our conduct, who labor
   in the connection with Mr. Wesley, in America?

   Answer Yes.

   3. If so, does it not follow, that if any preachers deviate from the
   minutes, we can have no fellowship with them till they change their
   conduct?

   Answer Yes.

   The following rules were agreed to by all the preachers present: --
    1. Every preacher who acts in connection with Mr. Wesley and the
       brethren who labor in America, is strictly to avoid administering
       the ordinances of baptism and the Lord's supper.
    2. All the people among whom we labor to be earnestly exhorted to
       attend the Church, and to receive the ordinances there; but in a
       particular manner to press the people in Maryland and Virginia to
       the observance of this minute.
    3. No person or persons to be admitted into our love-feasts oftener
       than twice or thrice, unless they become members; and none to be
       admitted to the society meetings more than thrice.
    4. None of the preachers in America to reprint any of Mr. Wesley's
       books, without his authority (when it can be gotten) and the
       consent of their brethren.
    5. Robert Williams to sell the books he has already printed, but to
       print no more, unless under the above restrictions.
    6. Every preacher who acts as an assistant, to send an account of the
       work once in six months to the general assistant.

   Question 1. How are the preachers stationed?

   Answer New York, Thomas Rankin, to change in four months [with
   Shadford]; Philadelphia, George Shadford, to change four months [with
   Rankin]; New Jersey, John King, William Watters; Baltimore, Francis
   Asbury, Robert Strawbridge, Abraham Whitworth, Joseph Yearbry; Norfolk,
   Richard Wright; Petersburg, Robert Williams.

   Question 2. What numbers are there in the society?

   Answer New York, 180; Philadelphia, 180; New Jersey, 200; Maryland,
   500; Virginia, 100; [Total] 1160; (Preachers 10.)

   It is highly probable that some of the preachers had manifested an
   unwillingness to submit entirely to the authority of Mr. Wesley in all
   matters, and hence the reason and seasonableness of the above minute in
   respect to yielding obedience to his authority. That Mr. Strawbridge
   and some others had evinced a disposition so far to depart from
   Wesleyan Methodism as to administer the ordinances of baptism and the
   Lord's supper, we know; and that it required all the authority of Mr.
   Asbury to restrain them from this practice heretofore, is evident from
   a former quotation from his Journal. To prevent a repetition of this
   disorderly practice, it seems the above prohibitory rule was adopted in
   reference to this subject.

   In the above stations we find the name of William Watters, who was the
   first American preacher who joined the itinerancy, and he continued a
   laborious and successful laborer in his Master's work until the day of
   his death.

   It seems that, notwithstanding the vigilance of Mr. Asbury in
   correcting those abuses which had arisen from the laxity with which
   discipline had been administered, many disorders still existed for
   which an adequate remedy had not been provided. These things had been
   communicated to Mr. Wesley, and he therefore clothed Mr. Rankin with
   powers superior to any which had been vested in his predecessors in
   office, in the faithful exercise of which he set himself to purifying
   the societies from corrupt members, and restoring things to order. It
   was soon found that the discharge of this duty, however painful,
   instead of abridging the influence of ministerial labor, greatly
   extended it, and exerted a most salutary effect upon the societies.
   Speaking of the comfort he derived from the arrival of Mr. Rankin, Mr.
   Asbury says, "Though he will not be admired as a preacher, yet as a
   disciplinarian he will fill his place."

   Having thus adopted the Wesleyan plan of stationing the preachers, and
   each man going to his work in the name of the Lord, the cause of
   reformation began to spread more extensively than heretofore; new
   societies were formed in many places, the circuits were enlarged, and a
   more regular administration of discipline secured. On the eastern shore
   of Maryland, particularly in the county of Kent, there was a
   considerable revival of religion, by which many souls were brought to
   the "knowledge of salvation by the remission of sins." A class was
   formed at New Rochelle, about twenty miles from the city of New York.
   In Baltimore also there was an enlargement of the work, more especially
   at Fell's Point, where they commenced building a house of worship,
   which was the first erected in the city of Baltimore. Though Mr. Asbury
   was appointed to Baltimore, he by no means confined his labor to that
   place, but traveled extensively through various parts of Maryland,
   preaching every day, forming those who had been awakened to a sense of
   their sin and danger into classes, that they might the more easily help
   each other to work out their salvation. In consequence of these labors,
   the work of religion spread among the people.

   In the city of New York, it appears that Mr. Rankin met with some
   opposition in his endeavors to reduce the classes to order and
   regularity; but his steady perseverance overcame the obstacles thrown
   in his way, so that he succeeded in his pious designs. He also, as the
   general assistant, traveled as extensively as practicable, that he
   might take a general oversight of the work, and see that the rules by
   which they professed to be governed were suitably enforced.

   In the beginning of 1774, the foundation of a house of worship was laid
   in Baltimore, known by the name of Light Street church, and another in
   Kent county, about nine miles below Chestertown, called the Kent
   meeting-house. This latter house was not erected without considerable
   opposition. After the frame was prepared for raising, some wicked
   persons came in the night and broke the rafters; but the workmen soon
   repaired the loss, the house was finished, and the work of the Lord
   prospered abundantly.

   1774. On the 25th of May, of this year, the second conference was held
   in the city of Philadelphia. From the minutes it appears that seven
   preachers, namely, William Duke, John Wade, Daniel Ruff, Edward
   Drumgole, Isaac Rollins, Robert Lindsay, and Samuel Spragg were
   admitted on trial; and William Watters, Abraham Whitworth, Joseph
   Yearbry, Philip Gatch, and Philip Ebert were admitted into full
   connection; most of these, it seems, had been raised up in America
   during the past two years, for we find no mention of any of their
   names, except William Watters, Abraham Whitworth, and Joseph Yearbry,
   among the stations the preceding year. This year, it seems, they
   adopted the practice introduced into the conferences by Mr. Wesley and
   which has ever since been followed in this country, namely, that of
   examining the preachers' characters before the conference; for we find
   the following question and answer: -- "Quest. Are there any objections
   to any of the preachers? Answer They were examined one by one."

   The following are the stations and numbers, and the rules which were
   agreed upon.

   New York, Francis Asbury, to change in three months [with Rankin];
   Philadelphia, Thomas Rankin, to change in three months [with Asbury];
   Trenton, William Watters; Greenwich, Philip Ebert; Chester, Daniel
   Ruff, Joseph Yearbry, to change with Wm. Watters and P. Ebert; Kent,
   Abraham Whitworth; Baltimore, George Shadford, Edward Drumgole, Richard
   Webster, Robert Lindsay; Frederick, Philip Gatch, William Duke;
   Norfolk, John King; Brunswick, John Wade, Isaac Rollins, Samuel Spragg.

   All the preachers to change at the end of six months.

   Question 6. What numbers are there in society?

   Answer New York 222; Philadelphia 204; New Jersey 257; Chester 36;
   Baltimore 738; Frederick 175; Norfolk 73; Brunswick 218; Kent 150;
   [Total] 2073; (Preachers 17.)

   This conference agreed to the following particulars: --
    1. Every preacher who is received into full connection is to have the
       use and property of his horse, which any of the circuits may
       furnish him with.
    2. Every preacher to be allowed six pounds Pennsylvania currency per
       quarter, and his traveling charges besides.
    3. For every assistant to make a general collection at Easter, in the
       circuits where they labor; to be applied to the sinking of the
       debts on the houses, and relieving the preachers in want.
    4. Wherever Thomas Rankin spends his time, he is to be assisted by
       those circuits."

   From this, it appears that the number had increased 913, being nearly
   double to what they were the year before; and that they had seven
   additional preachers. This shows the beneficial influence of enforcing
   a Scriptural discipline, and adopting an extended method of preaching
   the gospel by a regular itinerancy.

   In the beginning of this year, Messrs. Boardman and Pillmore left the
   continent for England; the former, who had endeared himself much to the
   people by his indefatigable labors and Christian deportment, never to
   return; the latter, Mr. Pillmore, soon after came back, was admitted
   and ordained as a minister in the Protestant Episcopal Church, in which
   he lived respected and beloved as a useful minister until his death.
   Mr. Boardman lived about eight years after his return to Europe, and
   then died in peace, leaving behind him a name that is "like precious
   ointment poured forth." It seems that Mr. Strawbridge did not continue
   in the regular itinerancy, as we do not find his name in the minutes of
   conference; the probability is, that he became disaffected on account
   of the opposition manifested to his administering the ordinances, to
   which he adhered with great pertinacity.

   The Journal of Mr. Asbury for this year shows the steady manner in
   which he pursued his work. So far from confining himself to the cities
   of New York and Baltimore, in each of which he was stationed for six
   months, he traversed the country between the two places, as well as
   north and south of each; and he everywhere found multitudes who flocked
   to hear the word, and not a few received it with joy, and were formed
   into classes under the general rules. His example provoked others to
   like diligence, though some manifested a reluctance to leave the
   comforts of a city life for the more fatiguing labors of a country
   itinerant. The blessed effects of these labors were soon apparent.
   Among others who contributed largely to the extension of this work, we
   must not forget to record the labors of Robert Williams, of whom Mr.
   Asbury says in his Journal, "He is a singular man, but honest in his
   intentions, and sincerely engaged for the prosperity of the work." In
   the same connection he says, "I met brother W. from Virginia, who gave
   me a great account of the work of God in these parts; five or six
   hundred souls justified by faith, and five or six circuits formed, so
   that we now have fourteen circuits in America, and about twenty-two
   preachers are required to supply them."

   It seems that in the early part of this year, Mr. Williams penetrated
   into Virginia, and finally succeeded in extending the work from
   Petersburgh south, over the Roanoke River, some distance into South
   Carolina; and from the conference three preachers, John King, John
   Wade, and Isaac Rollins, were sent to his help. Toward the close of the
   year, a most remarkable revival of godliness was the effect of their
   united labors, which terminated as above related by Mr. Asbury.

   Such were the indefatigable labors of Mr. Asbury, his constant
   preaching, his exposures by day and night, that he finally sunk under
   them, and was obliged to take to his bed, and submit to medical
   treatment. So feeble was he, that he says, for nine days he was not
   able even to write in his Journal. "My friends," says he, "were very
   kind, and expecting my death, they affectionately lamented over me."
   The Lord, however, blessed the means prescribed for his recovery, so
   that in about three weeks from the time of his confinement, he was able
   to resume those labors in which his soul delighted. The latter part of
   this year he spent in Baltimore and the adjoining settlements, in all
   which places he enjoyed much of the presence of God, and often
   witnessed the displays of his power in the awakening and conversion of
   sinners.

   1775. -- On the 17th of May of this year, the third conference was held
   in the city of Philadelphia. Of this conference, Mr. Asbury says that
   it sat from Wednesday to Friday, "with great harmony and sweetness of
   temper." This record to the good temper exemplified in the conference
   is made with a view to show that, notwithstanding some difficulties had
   occurred between Mr. Rankin and Mr. Asbury, they were not of that
   serious nature which went to interrupt the harmony of their counsels.
   To a difference of judgment between them, Mr. Asbury alludes in several
   places, by which it appears that, in his opinion, Mr. Rankin assumed
   too much authority over the preachers and people.

   In consequence of this assumption of power, Mr. Rankin exposed himself
   to the censures of many of his brethren, and to the remonstrances of
   Mr. Asbury, as it tended, in his opinion, to alienate the affections of
   the people from their preachers. These things laid the foundation for
   those complaints against Mr. Asbury which were transmitted to Mr.
   Wesley, and afterward became the cause of much of that uneasiness which
   will be noticed hereafter. Such errors of judgment may very well exist
   among the best of men, without at all detracting from their moral worth
   or Christian character, and may even be overruled by our heavenly
   Father for the general good of his church. The sternness of character
   manifested by Mr. Rankin, while it sustained him in the rigorous
   exercise of discipline, was not so exactly suited to the genius of the
   American people as was the more gentle yet equally firm disposition of
   Mr. Asbury.

   The numbers returned in society were 3,148, by which it appears that
   the increase had been 1,075. Strong symptoms of a war between the
   colonies and the mother country now began to be manifested in different
   parts of the American settlements, by which the minds of the people
   were much agitated on political subjects; and as all the leading
   Methodist preachers were from England, no little suspicion, however
   groundless, was entertained respecting the purity of their motives.
   That most of these were strongly biased in favor of their mother
   country seems reasonable to suppose; nor are they to be blamed for this
   feeling, when we consider how natural it is for all men to feel an
   attachment for the land of their nativity. These suspicions, however,
   though not yet exemplified in any open acts of hostility, tended in
   some places to circumscribe the usefulness of the preacher, and to make
   those of them who came from England turn their attention toward home.

   Notwithstanding these unpropitious circumstances, the conference
   proceeded in their customary work, passing a resolution to raise a
   yearly collection for general purposes, and making out the stations of
   the preachers, which were now increased to nineteen in number,
   distributed among the several circuits. Among other things which they
   did, was passing the following resolution, which shows their
   apprehensions respecting the political state of the country, and their
   pious concern for the prosperity of the work of God. They appointed "a
   general fast for the prosperity of the work, and for the peace of
   America, on Tuesday the 18th of July."

   This year, Mr. Asbury was appointed to labor in Norfolk, state of
   Virginia, where, he says, he found "about thirty persons in society,
   but they had no class meetings," and were therefore in rather a
   disorderly state. Finding nothing better for a "preaching house than an
   old shattered building, which had formerly been a play-house," after
   laboring a few days alternately in Norfolk and Portsmouth, he persuaded
   the brethren to issue a subscription paper for building a house of
   worship, which, however, went tardily on for the present. As usual, Mr.
   Asbury omitted no opportunity of doing good to the souls of the people;
   and for this purpose he made frequent excursions into the country,
   where he generally found a people willing to hear the word of
   reconciliation. Having been invited to visit Brunswick circuit, where
   the Lord was pouring out his Spirit upon the labors of Mr. Shadford, on
   the 2d of November he arrived there, and says, "God is at work in this
   part of the country, and my soul catches the holy fire." On meeting
   with Mr. Shadford, he says, "My spirit is much united to him, and our
   meeting was like that of David and Jonathan."

   There was indeed a remarkable revival of the work of God in this part
   of the country, chiefly through the instrumentality of Mr. Shadford.
   Trembling and shaking would seize upon sinners under the word, and in
   some instances they were so affected as to fall lifeless upon the floor
   or upon the ground. These were strange appearances in this country, and
   some, of course, looked on with astonishment at these manifest displays
   of the power and grace of God. The consequence of this great and
   extensive revival was an addition to the societies of upward of 1800
   members.

   Mr. Robert Williams, who was among the first Methodist preachers that
   visited Virginia, had married, and located at a place between Norfolk
   and Suffolk, where he ended his days in peace, on the 26th September
   1775. His funeral sermon was preached by Mr. Asbury, who says of him,
   that he "has been a very useful man, and the Lord gave him many seals
   to his ministry. Perhaps no man in America has been an instrument of
   awakening so many souls as God has awakened by him."

   As the revival above spoken of was one of the first of the kind in this
   part of the country, and was, in many respects, very remarkable in its
   character, I think it proper to give here an account of it as I find it
   inserted in Mr. Asbury's Journal. The writer of this account was the
   Rev. Mr. Jarratt, a minister of the English Church, who participated
   largely in that revival, and contributed by his labors to its
   advancement, by favoring the Methodist preachers, and administering the
   ordinances to such as desired them. Had all the clergy of that day
   manifested a kindred spirit, how much more extensively would the work
   have prevailed!

  A BRIEF NARRATIVE OF THE REVIVAL OF RELIGION IN VIRGINIA. IN A LETTER TO A
  FRIEND.

   "Dear Sir, -- You was pleased, when in Virginia, to desire a narrative
   of the work of God in these parts. I shalt give you matter of fact, in
   a plain, artless dress; relating only what I have myself seen and
   heard, and what I have received from men on whose judgment and veracity
   I can fully depend.

   "That you may have a full view of the whole, I shall go back as far as
   my first settlement in this parish. August 29, 1763, I was chosen
   rector of B., in the county of D., in Virginia. Ignorance of the things
   of God, profaneness, and irreligion, then prevailed among all ranks and
   degrees; so that I doubt if even the form of godliness was to be found
   in any one family of this large and populous parish. I was a stranger
   to the people: my doctrines were quite new to them; and were neither
   preached nor believed by any other clergyman, so far as I could learn,
   throughout the province.

   "My first work was to explain the depravity of our nature, our fall in
   Adam, and all the evils consequent thereon; the impossibility of being
   delivered from them by any thing which we could do, an the necessity of
   a living faith, in order to our obtaining help from God. While I
   continued to insist upon these truths, and on the absolute necessity of
   being born again, no small outcry was raised against this way, as well
   as against him that taught it. But, by the help of God, I continued to
   witness the same both to small and great.

   "The common people, however, frequented the church more constantly, and
   in larger numbers than usual. Some were affected at times, so as to
   drop a tear. But still for a year or more, I perceived no lasting
   effect, only a few were not altogether so profane as before. I could
   discover no heartfelt convictions of sin, no deep or lasting impression
   of their lost estate. Indeed, I have reason to believe that some have
   been a good deal alarmed at times; but they were shy of speaking to me
   (thinking it would be presumption) till their convictions wore off.

   "But in the year 1765, the power of God was more sensibly felt by a
   few. These were constrained to apply to me, and inquire, What they must
   do to be saved?' And now I began to preach abroad, as well as in
   private houses; and to meet little companies in the evenings, and
   converse freely on divine things. I believe some were this year
   converted to God, and thenceforth the work of God slowly went on.

   "The next year I became acquainted with Mr. M'R., rector of a
   neighboring parish; and we joined hand in hand in the great work. He
   labored much therein, and not in vain. A remarkable power attended his
   preaching, and many were truly converted to God, not only in his
   parish, but in other parts where he was called to labor.

   "In the years 1770 and 1771, we had a more considerable outpouring of
   the Spirit, at a place in my parish called White Oak. It was here first
   I formed the people into a society, that they might assist and
   strengthen each other. The good effects of this were soon apparent.
   Convictions were deep and lasting; and not only knowledge, but faith,
   and love, and holiness continually increased.

   "In the year 1772, the revival was more considerable, and extended
   itself in some places for fifty or sixty miles around. It increased
   still more in the following year, and several sinners were truly
   converted to God. In spring, 1774, it was more remarkable than ever.
   The word preached was attended with such energy that many were pierced
   to the heart. Tears fell plentifully from the eyes of the hearers, and
   some were constrained to cry out. A goodly number were gathered in this
   year, both in my parish and in many of the neighboring counties. I
   formed several societies out of those which were convinced or
   converted; and I found it a happy means of building up those that had
   believed, and preventing the rest from losing their convictions.

   In the counties of Sussex and Brunswick, the work from the year 1773
   was chiefly carried on by the labors of the people called Methodists.
   The first of them who appeared in these parts was Mr. R. W., who, you
   know, was a plain, artless, indefatigable preacher of the gospel: he
   was greatly blessed in detecting the hypocrite, razing false
   foundations, and stirring believers up to press after a present
   salvation from the remains of sin. He came to my house in the month of
   March, in the year 1773. The next year others of his brethren came, who
   gathered many societies both in this neighborhood, and in other places,
   as far as North Carolina. They now began to ride the circuit, and to
   take care of the societies already formed, which was rendered a happy
   means both of deepening and spreading the work of God.

   I earnestly recommended it to my societies, to pray much for the
   prosperity of Sion, and for a larger outpouring of the Spirit of God.
   They did so, and not in vain. We have had a time of refreshing indeed a
   revival of religion, as great as perhaps ever was known, in country
   places, in so short a time. It began in the latter end of the year
   1775; but was more considerable in January 1776, the beginning of the
   present year. It broke out nearly at the same time, at three places not
   far from each other. Two of these places are in my parish, the other in
   Amelia county, which had for many years been notorious for
   carelessness, profaneness, and immoralities of all kinds. Gaming,
   swearing, drunkenness, and the like, were their delight, while things
   sacred were their scorn and contempt. However, some time last year, one
   of my parish (now a local preacher) appointed some meetings among them,
   and after a while, induced a small number to join in society. And
   though few, if any of them, were then believers, yet this was a means
   of preparing the way of the Lord.

   "As there were few converts in my parish the last year, I was sensible
   a change of preachers was wanting. This has often revived the work of
   God; and so it did at the present time. Last December, one of the
   Methodist preachers, Mr. S., preached several times at the three places
   above mentioned. He confirmed the doctrine I had long preached; and to
   many of them not in vain. And while their ears were opened by novelty,
   God set his word home upon their hearts. Many sinners were powerfully
   convinced, and mercy! mercy! was their cry. In January, the news of
   convictions and conversions were common; and the people of God were
   inspired with new life and vigor by the happiness of others. But in a
   little time they were made strongly sensible that they themselves stood
   in need of a deeper work in their hearts than they had yet experienced.
   And while those were panting and groaning for pardon, these were
   entreating God, with strong cries and tears, to save them from the
   remains of inbred sin, to 'sanctify them throughout in spirit, soul,
   and body;' so to circumcise their hearts,' that they might love God
   with all their hearts,' and serve him with all their strength.

   "During this whole winter, the Spirit of the Lord was poured out in a
   manner we had not seen before. In almost every assembly might be seen
   signal instances of divine power, more especially in the meetings of
   the classes. Here many old stout-hearted sinners felt the force of
   truth, and their eyes were open to discover their guilt and danger. The
   shaking among the dry bones was increased from week to week: nay,
   sometimes ten or twelve have been deeply convinced of sin in one day.
   Some of these were in great distress, and when they were questioned
   concerning the state of their souls, were scarce able to make any reply
   but by weeping and falling on their knees, before all the class, and
   earnestly soliciting the prayers of God's people. And from time to time
   he has answered these petitions, set the captives at liberty, and
   enabled them to praise a pardoning God in the midst of his people.
   Numbers of old and gray-headed, of middle-aged persons, of youth, yea,
   of little children, were the subjects of this work. Several of the
   latter we have seen painfully concerned for the wickedness of their
   lives, and the corruption of their nature. We have instances of this
   sort from eight or nine years old. Some of these children are exceeding
   happy in the love of God; and they speak of the whole process of the
   work of God, of their convictions, the time when, and the manner how
   they obtained deliverance, with such clearness as might convince an
   atheist that this is nothing else but the great power of God.

   Many in these parts, who have long neglected the means of grace, now
   flocked to hear, not only me and the traveling preachers, but also the
   exhorters and leaders. And the Lord showed he is not confined to man;
   for whether there was preaching or not, his power was still sensible
   among the people. And at their meetings for prayer, some have been in
   such distress that they have continued therein for five or six hours.
   And it has been found that these prayer-meetings were singularly useful
   in promoting the work of God.

   "The outpouring of the Spirit which began here, soon extended itself,
   more or less, through most of the circuit, which is regularly attended
   by the traveling preachers, and which takes in a circumference of
   between four and five hundred miles. And the work went on with a
   pleasing progress till the beginning of May, when they held a quarterly
   meeting at B's chapel, in my parish. This stands at the lower line of
   the parish, thirty miles from W.'s chapel, at the upper line of it,
   where the work began. At this meeting one might truly say the windows
   of heaven were opened, and the rain of divine influence poured down for
   more than forty days. The work now became more deep than ever, extended
   wider, and was swifter in its operations. Many were savingly converted
   to God, and in a very short time, not only in my parish, but through
   several parts of Brunswick, Sussex, Prince George, Lunenburg,
   Mecklenburg, and Amelia counties.

   "The second day of the quarterly meeting a love-feast was held. As soon
   as it began, the power of the Lord came down on the assembly like a
   rushing mighty wind; and it seemed as if the whole house was filled
   with the presence of God. A flame kindled and ran from heart to heart.
   Many were deeply convinced of sin; many mourners were filled with
   consolation: and many believers were so overwhelmed with love that they
   could not doubt but God had enabled them to love him with all their
   heart.

   "When the love-feast was ended the doors were opened. Many who had
   stayed without then came in; and beholding the anguish of some, and the
   rejoicing of others, were filled with astonishment; and not long after
   with trembling apprehensions of their own danger. Several of them,
   prostrating themselves before God, cried aloud for mercy. And the
   convictions which then began in many, have terminated in a happy and
   lasting change.

   "The multitudes that attended on this occasion, returning home all
   alive to God, spread the flame through their respective neighborhoods,
   which ran from family to family; so that within four weeks several
   hundreds found the peace of God. And scarce any conversation was to be
   heard throughout the circuit, but concerning the things of God: either
   the complainings of the prisoners, groaning under the spirit of bondage
   unto fear, or the rejoicing of those whom the Spirit of adoption taught
   to cry, Abba, Father.' The unhappy disputes between England and her
   colonies, which just before had engrossed all our conversation, seemed
   now in most companies to be forgot, while things of far greater
   importance lay so near the heart. I have gone into many, and not small
   companies, wherein there did not appear to be one careless soul; and
   the far greater part seemed perfectly happy in a clear sense of the
   love of God.

   One of the doctrines, as you know, which we particularly insist upon,
   is that of a present salvation; a salvation not only from the guilt and
   power, but also from the root of sin; a cleansing from all filthiness
   of flesh and spirit, that we may perfect holiness in the fear of God; a
   going on to perfection, which we sometimes define by loving God with
   all our hearts. Several who had believed were deeply sensible of their
   want of this. I have seen both men and women, who had long been happy
   in a sense of God's pardoning love, as much convicted on account of the
   remains of sin in their hearts, and as much distressed for a total
   deliverance from them, as ever I saw any for justification. Their whole
   cry was,

   O that I now the rest might know, Believe and enter in; Now, Saviour,
   now, the power bestow, And let me cease from sin.'

   And I have been present when they believed that God answered this
   prayer, and bestowed this blessing upon them. I have conversed with
   them several times since, and have found them thoroughly devoted to
   God. They all testify that they have received the gift instantaneously,
   and by simple faith. We have sundry witnesses of this perfect love, who
   are above all suspicion. I have known the men and their communication
   for many years, and have ever found them zealous for the cause of God:
   men of sense and integrity, patterns of piety and humility, whose
   testimony therefore may be depended on.

   "It has been frequently observed, that there never was any remarkable
   revival of religion, but some degree of enthusiasm was mingled with it
   -- some wild fire mixed with the sacred flame. It may be doubted
   whether this is not unavoidable in the nature of things. And
   notwithstanding all the care we have taken, this work has not been
   quite free from it; but it never rose to any considerable height,
   neither was of long continuance. In some meetings there has not been
   that decency and order observed which I could have wished. Some of our
   assemblies resembled the congregation of the Jews at the laying the
   foundation of the second temple in the days of Ezra -- some wept for
   grief, others shouted for joy, so that it was hard to distinguish one
   from the other. So it was here: the mourning and distress were so
   blended with the voice of joy and gladness that it was hard to
   distinguish the one from the other, till the voice of joy prevailed:
   the people shouting with a great shout, so that it might be heard afar
   off.

   "To give you, a fuller insight into this great work of God, I subjoin
   an extract from two or three of my letters.

   "To the Rev. Mr. M'R.

   "May 3, 1776.

   "Rev. and Dear Brother, -- Yesterday I preached at B.'s chapel to a
   crowded and attentive audience. Afterward the Methodists held their
   love-feast: during which as many as pleased rose, one after another,
   and spoke in few words of the goodness of God to their souls. Before
   three had done speaking, (although they spoke but few words,) you might
   see a solemn sense of the presence of God visible on every countenance,
   while tears of sorrow or joy were flowing from many eyes. Several
   testified the consolation they had received: some believed they were
   perfected in love. When the passions of the people were rising too
   high, and breaking through all restraint, the preacher gently checked
   them by giving out a few verses of a hymn. When most of the
   congregation went away, some were so distressed with a sense of their
   sins that they could no be persuaded to leave the place. Some lively
   Christians stayed with them, and continued in prayer for the space of
   two hours, till fifteen mourners were enabled to rejoice in God their
   Saviour. And some careless creatures of the politer sort, who would
   needs go in to see what this strange thing meant, felt an unusual
   power, so that like Saul among the prophets, they fell down on their
   knees, and cried for mercy among the rest. O may they still continue to
   pray, till God has given them another heart!'"

   "May 3, 1776

   "Last night three or four score of my neighbors met together to keep a
   watchnight: at which it is the custom to spend three or four hours in
   religious exercises, and to break up at twelve. Such was the distress
   of those that were convinced of sin that they continued in prayer all
   night, and till two hours after sunrise. Here also fourteen or fifteen
   received a sense of pardon: so that in two days thirty of my own parish
   have been justified, besides others of other parishes.

   "Indeed, I do not take it for granted that all are justified who think
   they are so. Some, I fear, are mistaken. But I shall judge better of
   this when I see the fruits.'"

   "May 7, 1776

   "The work of God still increases among us: I believe, within these
   eight days, more than forty here have been filled with joy and peace in
   believing. Of these I have had an account; but there may be many more.
   And several, who have been justified some time, believe God has blessed
   them with perfect love.

   "I have no doubt but the work now carrying on is genuine: yet there
   were some circumstances attending it which I disliked: such as loud
   outcries, tremblings, fallings, convulsions. But I am better reconciled
   since I read President Edwards on that head, who observes, That
   wherever these most appear, there is always the greatest and the
   deepest work.'

   "There is another thing which has given me much pain: the praying of
   several at one and the same time. Sometimes five or six, or more, have
   been praying all at once, in several parts of the room, for distressed
   persons. Others were speaking by way of exhortation, so that the
   assembly appeared to be all in confusion, and must seem, to one at a
   little distance, more like a drunken rabble than the worshippers of
   God, I was afraid this was not doing all things in decency and order.
   Indeed Dr. Edwards defends this also. But yet I am not satisfied
   concerning it. I had heard of it, but never saw it till Sunday evening.
   But this is a delicate point. It requires much wisdom to allay the
   wild, and not damp the sacred fire.

   "The first appearance of any thing of the kind at my chapel was last
   Saturday night. I was not there, but a young man who studies at my
   house was. He is grave, prudent, and solidly religious, without the
   least tincture of enthusiasm. He met the society there in the
   afternoon, and would have returned home, but that many who were in
   great distress begged him, and some others, to stay and pray with them.
   They continued in prayer the whole night, during which about twelve
   were set at liberty. But, notwithstanding all they could do, there were
   often two, three, or more speaking at one time.

   "I heard of this the next day, when I was at church, and hastened
   thence to the chapel. Some hundreds were assembled there, and were in
   much confusion when I went in. I went into the pulpit and began to
   sing, adding short exhortations and prayers. The confusion ceased:
   several spirits were revived, and some mourners comforted.

   "Since that evening this kind of confusion has never been known in my
   neighborhood. It continued longer in other places; but for some time
   has been totally gone. But as this abated, the work of conviction and
   conversion usually abated too. Yet, blessed be God, it still goes on,
   though not with such rapidity. I have heard but of two or three that
   found peace for three weeks; whereas some time ago seldom a week
   passed, but I could hear of eight or nine; sometimes between twenty and
   thirty at one meeting.

   "I have chiefly spoken of what was done in my parish. But that you may
   know a little of what was done elsewhere, I subjoin an extract from the
   letters of two local preachers, in the county of Sussex.'

   "July 29, 1776

   "Rev Sir, -- With unspeakable pleasure I acquaint you of the glorious
   revival of religion in our parts. It broke out at our last quarterly
   meeting, and has since wonderfully spread throughout the circuit. The
   time seems to be coming when we shall not need to teach every man his
   neighbor to know the Lord: for they daily know him from the least to
   the greatest, from little children to men of fourscore. Above seven
   years have I been exhorting my neighbors; but very few would hear. Now,
   blessed be God, there are few that will not hear. It is no strange
   thing for two or three to find the Lord at a class meeting: and at a
   Sunday meeting, although there was no preacher, ten, fifteen, yea,
   nearly twenty have been converted. At a place near me, thirty have
   found the Lord within eight days. It is common with us for men and
   women to fall down as dead under an exhortation, but many more under
   prayer, perhaps twenty a time. And some that have not fallen to the
   earth have shown the same distress, wringing their hands, smiting their
   breasts, and begging all to pray for them. With these the work is
   generally quick; some getting through in less than a week, some in two
   or three days; some in one, two, or three hours. Nay, we have an
   instance of one that was so indifferent as to leave her brethren at
   prayers and go to bed. But all at once she screamed out under a sense
   of her lost estate, and in less than fifteen minutes rejoiced in God
   her Saviour. And, blessed be God, many of these retain a sense of his
   favor. Many, who a few weeks ago were despisers and scoffers, are now
   happy in the Lord. Many old Christians, who were always full of doubts
   and fears, now walk in the light of his countenance. Some have a clear
   witness in themselves that they have given their whole hearts to God. O
   may God carry on his work among us, until we are all swallowed up in
   love!

   T. S.'

   "Mr. S. lives two-and twenty miles from me: the writer of the following
   letter about thirty.

   "July 29, 1776

   "Rev. Sir, -- On June the 9th, we had a large congregation. I spoke on,
   "No man can serve two masters." Several appeared to be much distressed,
   two women in particular. We spent above an hour in prayer for them, and
   they arose in peace. When we met the class, we suffered all that
   desired it to stay. The leader only put a question or two to each
   member. This was scarce ended, when the fire of God's love was kindled.
   Praises hung on the lips of many; and several cried out, "What must we
   do to be saved?" Thus it swiftly went on; every now and then one rising
   with faith in Jesus. Surely this was one of the days of heaven! Such a
   day I never expected to see in time. While we were met, one I. W. was
   observed to be looking through the crack of the door which being
   opened, he came with it, and, being unable to stand, fell on the floor
   quite helpless. But in two or three hours he rose and praised a
   pardoning God while one of the class who had been justified some time,
   received a blessing greatly superior to any thing he had known before.
   We have reason to believe that, on this day, fifteen were enabled to
   believe in Jesus.

   "Saturday, June 15. -- I was speaking to the class, and one found peace
   to her soul. Sunday 16, I spoke from "This is the victory that
   overcometh the world, even our faith," to four or five hundred people.
   This was also a day of Pentecost. Convictions seized on numbers, who
   wrestled with God till their souls were set at liberty. A young woman
   told me, "She heard that many people fell down, and she would come to
   help them up." This she said in scorn. She came accordingly. The power
   of God soon seized her, and she wanted helping up herself. But it was
   not long before the Spirit of grace helped her, by giving her faith in
   Christ. We believe twenty souls found peace this day. O may we see many
   such days!

   "July 7. -- I spoke to a large congregation. Afterward was going to
   give out a hymn, when one was so powerfully struck that he could not
   hold a joint still, and roared aloud for mercy. I immediately went to
   prayer; the cries of the people all the time greatly increasing. After
   prayer, B. T., lately a great opposer, jumped up, and began to praise
   God, with a countenance so altered, that those who beheld him were
   filled with astonishment. Our meeting continued from twelve at noon
   till twelve at night; during which, God raised up about fifteen more
   witnesses.

   "The Thursday following, six of those who were convinced on Sunday,
   found peace in believing. We hear of many others converted in the
   neighborhood, several of whom were strong opposers; and some
   hoary-headed ones, who had been strict Pharisees from their youth up.

   "Sunday 21. -- We had a large and attentive auditory, and the power of
   the Lord prevailed. The next day I was much tempted to doubt, whether I
   was sent of God to preach or not? I prayed earnestly to the Lord that
   he would satisfy me, and that he would keep all false fire from among
   us. Afterward I preached. While I was speaking, a mother and her
   daughter were so struck with conviction that they trembled every joint;
   but before I concluded, both found peace. Glory be to God.

   "I am, &c., J. D.'

   "God has made examples of several opposers -- examples not of justice,
   but of mercy. Some of them came to the assembly with hearts full of
   rancor against the people of God, so that, had it been in their power,
   they would have dragged them away to prison, if not to death. But
   unexpectedly their stubborn hearts were bowed down, being pierced with
   the arrows of the Almighty. In a moment they were filled with distress
   and anguish, their laughter turned into mourning, and their cursing
   into prayer. And frequently in less than a week their heaviness has
   been turned into joy. Of this sort are several of our most zealous and
   circumspect walkers at this day. A goodly number of these are rich in
   this world; yet they are now brought so low that they are willing to be
   taught by all, and to be the servants of all.

   "A gentleman in this parish, in particular, had much opposed and
   contradicted; he was fully persuaded that all outward appearances,
   either of distress or joy, were mere deceit. But as he was walking to
   his mill, about half a mile from his house, deep conviction fell upon
   him. The terrors of the Lord beset him around about, and distress and
   anguish got hold upon him. When he came to the mill and found no one
   there, he took that opportunity of prostrating himself before God, and
   of pouring out his soul in his presence. As his distress was great, his
   cries were loud, and his prayer importunate. The Lord heard him, and
   set his soul at liberty before he left the place. And the power which
   came upon him was so great, that it seemed as if his whole frame was
   dissolving.

   "Upon the whole, this has been a great, a deep, a swift, an extensively
   glorious work. Both the nature and manner of it have been nearly the
   same, wherever its benign influence reached. Where the greatest work
   was, where the greatest number of souls have been convinced and
   converted to God, there have been the most outcries, tremblings,
   convulsions, and all sorts of external signs. I took all the pains I
   could that these might be kept within bounds, that our good might not
   be evil spoken of. This I did, not by openly inveighing against them in
   the public assembly, but by private advices to local preachers and
   others, as opportunity would permit. This method had its desired
   effect, without putting a sword into the hands of the wicked. Wherever
   the contrary method has been taken, where these things have been
   publicly opposed, when they have been spoken against in promiscuous
   congregations, the effect has always been this: the men of the world
   have been highly gratified, and the children of God deeply wounded. The
   former have plumed themselves as though they were the men who kept
   within due bounds, and those that had made so much ado about religion,'
   were no better than hot-brained enthusiasts. I cannot but think this
   has a great tendency to hinder the work of God. Indeed, if we thought
   that God wrought every thing irresistibly, we should not fear this. But
   we know the contrary: we know that as some things promote, so others
   hinder his work. I grant means should be used to prevent all indecency;
   but they should be used with great caution and tenderness, that the
   cure may be effected, if possible, without damping the work of God.

   "With regard to the inward work, there has been a great variety as to
   the length, and depth, and circumstances of the convictions in
   different persons; but all in general have been at first alarmed with a
   sense of the multitude and heinousness of their sins; with an awful
   view of the wrath of God, and certain destruction, if they persisted
   therein. Hence they betook themselves to prayer, and as time permitted,
   to the use of all other means of grace; although deeply sensible of the
   vileness of their performances, and the total insufficiency of all they
   could do to merit the pardon of one sin, or deserve the favor of God.
   They were next convinced of their unbelief, and that faith in Christ is
   the only condition of justification. They continued thus waiting upon
   the Lord, till he spoke peace to their souls. This he usually did in
   one moment, in a clear and satisfactory manner, so that all their
   griefs and anxieties vanished away, and they were filled with joy and
   peace in believing. Some indeed have had their burdens removed so that
   they felt no condemnation. And yet, they could not say they were
   forgiven. But they could not be satisfied with this. They continued
   instant in prayer till they knew the Lamb of God had taken away their
   sins.

   "Most or these had been suddenly convinced of sin: but with some it was
   otherwise. Without any sense or their guilt, they were brought to use
   the means of grace by mere dint of persuasion: and afterward they were
   brought by degrees to see themselves, and their want of a Saviour. But
   before they found deliverance they have had as deep a sense of their
   helpless misery as others. One in my parish was a remarkable instance
   of this. He was both careless and profane to a great degree; and
   remained quite unconcerned, while many of his companions were sorrowing
   after God, or rejoicing in his love. One of his acquaintance advised
   him to seek the Lord. He said, I see no necessity for it as yet. When I
   do I will seek him as well as others.' His friend persuaded him to try
   for one week, watching against sin, and going by himself every day. He
   did so: and though he was quite stupid when he began, yet before the
   end of the week, he was thoroughly sensible of the load of in, and is
   now happy in God.

   "If you ask, How stands the case with those that have been the subjects
   of the late work?' I have the pleasure to inform you, I have not heard
   of any one apostate yet. It is true, many, since their first joy
   abated, have given way to doubts and fears, have had their confidence
   in God much shaken, and have got into much heaviness. Several have
   passed through this, and are now confirmed in the ways of God. Others
   are in it still; and chiefly those over whom Satan had gained an
   advantage, by hurrying them into irregular warmth, or into expressions
   not well guarded. I have seen some of these in great distress, and just
   ready to cast away hope.

   "I have a great deal upon my hands at present, and have little time
   either to write or read. The difficulties and temptations of the lately
   converted are so many and various, that I am obliged to be in as many
   places as I can for now is the critical hour. A man of zeal, though
   with little knowledge or experience, may be an instrument of converting
   souls. But after they are converted, he will have need of much
   knowledge, much prudence and experience, to provide proper food and
   physic for the several members, according to their state, habit, and
   constitution. This at present seems in a great measure to devolve upon
   me. And though I have been twenty years in the Lord's service, yet I
   find I am quite unequal to the task. However, I will do what I can and
   may the Lord bless my endeavors!

   "The enemy is busy, night and day, in sowing the tares of division
   among the wheat. And in some places he has prevailed so far as to
   plunge some of them in the water. In other places little feuds and
   animosities arise, to grieve the preachers, and damp the spirits of the
   people. On these occasions, they commonly apply to me; and all is well,
   at least for a season. -- When I consider what it is to watch over
   souls, and how much labor and pains it implies, to discharge it in any
   degree, I cannot but cry out with the apostle, Who is sufficient for
   these things!'

   "However, upon the whole, things are in as flourishing a condition, as
   can reasonably be expected, considering what great numbers, of various
   capacities and stations, have been lately added to the societies.

   But after all, a great, part of Virginia is still in a very dark and
   deplorable condition. This province contains sixty-two counties and the
   late work has reached only seven or eight of them. Nor has it been
   universal even in these, but chiefly in the circuit which is regularly
   visited by the preachers. In this alone very many hundreds have in a
   few months been added to the Lord. And some are adding still. May he
   continue to pour out his Spirit upon us, and increase the number of the
   faithful every day!

   "Our highest gratitude is due to our gracious God; for he hath done
   marvellous things! In a short time he hath wrought a great work: and
   let who will speak against it, it is evident, beyond all contradiction,
   that many open and profligate sinners, of all sorts, have been
   effectually changed into pious, uniform ChristiAnswer So that every
   thinking man must allow that God hath been with us of a truth, and that
   his glory dwells in our land.' I am your sincere friend, and brother in
   Christ

   "To Mr. M. R. "D. J., September 10, 1776."

   The following letter, which relates to the same work, was written some
   time after.

   "To The Rev. Mr. Wesley

   "June 24, 1778

   "Rev. and Dear Sir, -- You have the narrative of the Rev. Mr. J. I send
   this as a supplement to it.

   "At our little conference held in Philadelphia, May 1775, Mr. S. was
   appointed assistant for Brunswick circuit, in Virginia. He found there
   about eight hundred joined together, but in a very confused manner.
   Many of them did not understand the nature of meeting in class; and
   many of the classes had no leader. He resolved to begin in good
   earnest; and the preachers with him were like-minded. Their constant
   custom was, as soon as preaching was over, to speak to all the members
   of the society, one by one. If the society was large, one preacher
   spoke to a part, and he that came next, to the rest. By this means they
   learned more of our doctrine and discipline in a year than in double
   the time before. The fruit soon appeared the congregations swiftly
   increased, and many were pricked to the heart. Many that were a little
   affected desired to see the nature of meeting in class: and while one
   was speaking, either to those that were groaning for redemption, or
   those who had found peace with God, these were frequently cut to the
   heart, and sometimes enabled on the spot to praise a pardoning God.
   Nay, sometimes four, five, or six found peace with God before the
   meeting was over.

   "The work of God thus increasing on every side, more preachers were
   soon wanting: and God raised up several young men, who were exceedingly
   useful as local preachers.

   "After Mr. S. had been about eight mouths in the circuit, Mr. J.
   desired his parish might be included in it, that all who chose it might
   have the privilege of meeting in class, and being members of the
   society. He soon saw the salutary effects. Many that had but small
   desires before began to be much alarmed, and labored earnestly after
   eternal life. In a little time numbers were deeply awakened, and many
   tasted of the pardoning love of God. In a few months Mr. J. saw more
   fruit of his labors than he had done for many years. And he went on
   with the preachers hand in hand, both in doctrine and discipline.

   "When Mr. S. took an account of the societies, before he came to the
   conference in 1776, they contained two thousand six hundred and
   sixty-four persons; to whom eighteen hundred were added in one year.
   Above a thousand of these had found peace with God; many of whom
   thirsted for all the mind that was in Christ. And divers believed God
   had circumcised their heart to love him with all their heart, and with
   all their soul.'

   "This revival of religion spread through fourteen counties in Virginia,
   and through Bute and Halifax counties in North Carolina. At the same
   time we had a blessed outpouring of the Spirit in several counties
   bordering upon Maryland.

   "Our conference was held at Baltimore Town, on the 22d of May. Here I
   received a letter from Mr. J., part of which I insert.

   "May 11, 1776

   "I praise God for his goodness, in so plentifully pouring out of his
   Spirit on men, women, and children. I believe threescore, in and near
   my parish, have believed, through grace, since the quarterly meeting.
   Such a work I never saw with my eyes. Sometimes twelve, sometimes
   fifteen, find the Lord at one class-meeting. I am just returned from
   meeting two classes. Much of the power of God was in each. -- My dear
   partner is now happy in God her Saviour. I clap my hands exulting, and
   praise God. Blessed be the Lord, that ever he sent you and your
   brethren into this part of his vineyard! Many children, from eight to
   twelve years old, are now under strong convictions; and some of them
   are savingly converted to God. I was much comforted this morning at the
   W. O. Chapel. The people there are of a truly teachable spirit; those
   particularly who profess to have obtained the pure love of God, They
   are as little children. When you consider how the work is spreading on
   every side, you will readily excuse me from being at your conference.'"

   Such a work as this, perhaps unexampled in the history of these
   provinces, at such a time, when they were upon the eve of a bloody
   contest, was matter of great encouragement to all concerned, as well as
   of lively gratitude to Almighty God. In the course of the summer, Mr.
   Rankin paid a visit to this part of the country. Being somewhat stern
   in his manners, and not accustomed to witness such awful displays of
   the power of God, he made an effort to still the people; and though he
   succeeded, in some measure, while in his presence, yet no sooner had he
   withdrawn from among them, than they broke forth in loud cries for
   mercy, while others shouted aloud the praises of God; and although some
   tincture of enthusiasm appeared among the young converts, in giving
   vent to the joys of their first love, it is evident that in general it
   was a genuine work of God, as was afterward manifested by its fruits.

   The following appears to be Mr. Rankin's own account of these wonderful
   things: --

   "Sunday 30. I was comforted by the sight of my dear brother S. But I
   was weak in body through riding so far in extreme heat, and much
   exercised in mind and did not know how I should be able to go through
   the labor of the day. We went to the chapel at ten, where I had liberty
   of mind and strength of body beyond my expectation. After preaching I
   met the society, and was more relieved both in body and mind. At four
   in the afternoon I preached again, from I set before thee an open door,
   and none can shut it.' I had gone through about two-thirds of my
   discourse, and was bringing the words home to the present now, when
   such power descended that hundreds fell to the ground, and the house
   seemed to shake with the presence of God. The chapel was full of white
   and black, and many were without that could not get in. Look wherever
   we would, we saw nothing but streaming eyes, and faces bathed in tears;
   and heard nothing but groans and strong cries after God and the Lord
   Jesus Christ. My voice was drowned amid the groans and prayers of the
   congregation. I then sat down in the pulpit; and both Mr. S. and I were
   so filled with the divine presence that we could only say, This is none
   other than the house of God! this is the gate of heaven! Husbands were
   inviting their wives to go to heaven, wives their husbands: parents
   their children, and children their parents: brothers their sisters, and
   sisters their brothers. In short, those who were happy in God
   themselves were for bringing all their friends to him in their arms.
   This mighty effusion of the Spirit continued for above an hour: in
   which time many were awakened, some found peace with God, and others
   his pure love. We attempted to speak or sing again and again: but no
   sooner we began than our voices were drowned. It was with much
   difficulty that we at last persuaded the people, as night drew on, to
   retire to their own homes.

   "Tuesday, July 2. I rode with Mr. S. to Mr. J.'s who, with Mrs. I.,
   received us with open arms. I preached the next day, not far from his
   house, to a deeply attentive congregation. Many were much affected at
   the preaching; but far more at the meeting of the society. Mr. J.
   himself was constrained to praise God aloud for his great love to him
   and to his people.

   "Sunday 7. I preached at W.'s chapel, about twenty miles from Mr. J.'s.
   I intended to preach near the house, under the shade of some large
   trees. But the rain made it impracticable. The house was greatly
   crowded, and four or five hundred stood at the doors and windows, and
   listened with unabated attention. I preached from Ezekiel's vision of
   the dry bones: "And there was a great shaking." I was obliged to stop
   again and again, and beg of the people to compose themselves. But they
   could not: some on their knees, and some on their faces, were crying
   mightily to God all the time I was preaching. Hundreds of Negroes were
   among them, with the tears streaming down their faces. The same power
   we found in meeting the society, and many were enabled to rejoice with
   joy unspeakable. In the cool of the evening I preached out of doors,
   and many found an uncommon blessing.

   "Every day the ensuing week I preached to large and attentive
   congregations. Indeed the weather was violently hot, and the fatigue of
   riding, and preaching so often, was great. But God made up all this to
   me by his comfortable presence. Thursday 11, I preached to a large
   congregation at the preaching house near Mr. J.'s. After preaching at
   several places on Friday and Saturday, on Sunday, 14, I came to Mr.
   B.'s, where I preached and met the society. The congregation was, as
   before, abundantly larger than the chapel could contain. And we had
   almost such a day as fourteen days ago: only attended with a more deep
   and solemn work. What a work is God working in this corner of Mr. J.'s
   parish! It seemed as if all the country for nine or ten miles around
   were ready to turn to God.

   "In the evening I rode to Mr. S.'s, and found a whole family fearing
   and loving God. Mr. S., a sensible and judicious man, had been for many
   years a justice of the peace. By hearing the truth as it is in Jesus,
   he and his wife first, and then all his children, had attained that
   peace that passeth all understanding. He observed, How amazing the
   change was which had been lately wrought in the place where he lived!
   That before the Methodists came into these parts, when he was called by
   his office to attend the court, there was nothing but drunkenness,
   cursing, swearing, and fighting most of the time the court sat: whereas
   now nothing is heard but prayer and praise, and conversing about God,
   and the things of God.'

   "Monday 15. I rode toward North Carolina. In every place the
   congregations were large, and received the word with all readiness of
   mind. I know not that I have spent such a week since I came to America.
   I saw everywhere such a simplicity in the people, with such a vehement
   thirst after the word of God, that I frequently preached and continued
   in prayer till I was hardly able to stand. Indeed there was no getting
   away from them while I was able to speak one sentence for God.

   "Sunday 21. I preached at Roanoke chapel, to more than double of what
   the house would contain. In general, the white people were within the
   chapel, and the black people without. The windows being all open, every
   one could hear, and hundreds felt the word of God. Many were bathed in
   tears, and others rejoicing with joy unspeakable. When the society met,
   many could not refrain from praising God aloud. I preached to a large
   company in the afternoon, and concluded the day with prayer and
   thanksgiving.

   "Tuesday 23. I crossed the Roanoke River, and preached at a chapel in
   North Carolina. And I preached every day to very large and deeply
   attentive congregations: although not without much labor and pain,
   through the extreme heat of the weather.

   On Tuesday 30 was our quarterly meeting. I scarce ever remember such a
   season. No chapel or preaching house in Virginia would have contained
   one-third of the congregation. Our friends, knowing this, had contrived
   to shade with boughs of trees a space that would contain two or three
   thousand persons. Under this, wholly screened from the rays of the sun,
   we held our general love-feast. It began between eight and nine on
   Wednesday morning, and continued till noon. Many testified that they
   had redemption in the blood of Jesus, even the forgiveness of sins.'
   And many were enabled to declare that it had cleansed them from all
   sin.' So clear, so full, so strong was their testimony, that while some
   were speaking their experience hundreds were in tears, and others
   vehemently crying to God for pardon or holiness.

   About eight our watch-night began. Mr. J. preached an excellent sermon:
   the rest of the preachers exhorted and prayed with divine energy.
   Surely, for the work wrought on these two days, many will praise God to
   all eternity. T. R."

   We have alluded to he suspicions which had been awakened in the minds
   of some respecting the designs of the English preachers. Mr. Wesley,
   who was ever alive to every thing which would seem to have a bearing
   upon the work of God, foreseeing the difficulties which would be likely
   to arise in America, on account of the approaching hostilities, thus
   addressed them in a letter dated,

   "London, March 1, 1775.

   "My Dear Brethren, -- You were never in your lives in so critical a
   situation as you are at this time. It is your part to be peace-makers:
   to be loving and tender to all; but to addict yourselves to no party.
   In spite of all solicitations, of rough or smooth words, say not one
   word against one or the other side. Keep yourselves pure; do all you
   can to help and soften all; but beware how you adopt another's jar.

   "See that you act in full union with each other: this is of the utmost
   consequence. Not only let there be no bitterness or anger, but no
   shyness or coldness between you. Mark all those that would set one
   against the other. Some such will never be wanting. But give them no
   countenance; rather ferret them out, and drag them into open day."

   This certainly was good and seasonable advice, admirably suited to the
   times.

   We have already alluded to a dissatisfaction expressed by Mr. Asbury of
   the spirit and conduct of Mr. Rankin: and it is certain, from sundry
   notices in his Journal, that he suspected strongly that Mr. R. had
   misrepresented him to Mr. Wesley. What the subject of difference was
   precisely, we cannot tell but it is manifest from the following extract
   of a letter from Mr. Wesley to Mr. Rankin, that the suspicions of Mr.
   Asbury were well founded. In this letter, which is dated May 19, l775,
   he says, "I doubt not but brother Asbury and you will part friends. I
   shall hope to see him at the conference. He is quite an upright man. I
   apprehend he will go through his work more cheerfully when he is within
   a little distance from me." But in a subsequent letter under date of
   July 28, of the same year, we find the following words "I rejoice over
   honest Francis Asbury, and hope he will no more enter into temptation."
   To what temptation Mr. Wesley alludes we know not; but to whatever
   particular allusion is made, we are constrained to believe, from the
   known integrity of heart, and uprightness of deportment ever
   exemplified by Mr. Asbury, there was no just cause for alarm on his
   account; and hence we are confirmed in the opinion before expressed,
   that either Mr. Rankin or some one else, probably from jealousy of the
   growing reputation of Mr. Asbury, had written to his disadvantage, and
   had even advised Mr. Wesley to call him home. It is due to truth, and
   to the character of Mr. Asbury, to say, that whatever representations
   might have been made disparaging to his character, they were without
   foundation, as has been proved by every act of Mr. Asbury's most
   laborious, self-denying, and useful life. And if the difficulties
   between him and Mr. Rankin arose merely from difference of judgment in
   regard to the general plan of procedure, the final result proves that
   the former was in the right; for he lived to outride the storm and to
   triumph over all his enemies, as the issue of his plans and labors.

   1776. On the 24th of May of this year, the annual conference was held
   for the first time in the city of Baltimore. In consequence of the
   great revival of religion above detailed, there had been an increase to
   the societies of one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three, the
   whole number being four thousand nine hundred and twenty-one, and nine
   preachers were admitted on trial. Four new circuits were formed,
   namely, Fairfax, Hanover, Pittsylvania, and Carolina, the former being
   in the state of Virginia, and the latter in North Carolina, places
   which had been blessed with the revival of religion already noticed.
   There were eleven circuits returned on the minutes, and twenty-five
   preachers stationed on them.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 2

    From the commencement of the Revolution in 1776, to its termination in 1783.

   This year forms a memorable era in the history of these United States.
   The sanguinary conflict which had commenced in 1775 now broke forth
   with increased violence, and all hope of reconciliation was prostrated,
   only on condition of an acknowledgment on the part of Great Britain of
   the independence of the United States.

   The fleets of England were in our harbors, and her soldiers were landed
   upon our shores. But what rendered a reconciliation hopeless was, that
   on the 4th of July, 1776, congress had declared the thirteen united
   colonies, which they represented, free and independent states.

   This state of things rendered the situation of many of the Methodist
   preachers peculiarly trying, and more especially those of them who were
   known to be favorable to the British cause. As some of them, not taking
   the very seasonable advice given by Mr. Wesley in the letter above
   inserted, spoke their sentiments freely against the proceedings of
   congress and of the American states, they were subjected to some
   persecutions. And although only four out of the twenty-five preachers
   were from England, yet as these four were leading men, the others were
   suspected of favoring the cause of Britain, and were therefore exposed
   to similar suspicions and treatment. Mr. Asbury, though among the most
   prudent of them all in his speech and conduct, says that on the 20th of
   June he was, "fined, near Baltimore, five pounds for preaching the
   gospel." But though it was with no little difficulty that they were
   able to travel some of the circuits, and obliged entirely to abandon
   others, yet conscious of their Christian integrity, the preachers
   persevered in their labors wherever they could find access to the
   people; and in many places their efforts were crowned with great
   success in the awakening and conversion of sinners; as is manifest from
   the increase of preachers and people before mentioned.

   Among those preachers, raised up in this country, we find on the
   minutes for this year the name of Freeborn Garrettson, whose labors
   afterward contributed so much to the advancement of the cause of Jesus
   Christ in these United States. [6]

   1777. The fifth conference was held this year in the Deer Creek meeting
   house, Harford county, in the state of Maryland. The war at this time
   raged with great violence, so that by the marching and countermarching
   of armies, enlisting of soldiers, frequent skirmishes between the
   contending parties, some of the places, even where religion had
   prevailed to a considerable extent, were not visited at all by the
   preachers. Last year Norfolk in Virginia was abandoned, and this year
   no preacher was stationed in New York; nor do we find this city among
   the stations again until 1783, though there was a small society of
   members still there. The cause of this abandonment of the city for so
   long a time was, that the British troops had it in possession, and had
   converted the meeting house into barracks for the soldiers, so that it
   was not possible to occupy it for preaching regularly, even had a
   preacher been permitted to reside among them. Such are the fatal
   results of war, that scourge of humanity. [7]

   But although these were the disastrous results of the war in some
   places, more particularly in the middle states, yet in others there
   were gracious outpourings of the Spirit, and revivals of the work of
   God, the southern states not being yet so much exposed to the ravages
   of this cruel warfare. In the Brunswick circuit, particularly, as well
   as the two circuits, Sussex and Amelia, which had been recently taken
   from it, and in some parts of North Carolina, the work of God continued
   to spread to a considerable extent. Though, therefore, there was a
   decrease of members on those circuits which were exposed to the
   depredations of contending armies, yet, when they came to the
   conference, they found an increase on the whole of 2047 members and 12
   preachers, making the entire number in society to be 6968, and 36
   preachers -- so mercifully did God own their labors for the salvation
   of souls. It was at this conference that those preachers who came from
   England took into consideration the propriety of returning home; but
   they finally concluded to remain a while longer, as the way seemed not
   yet plain for them to leave their American brethren. It seems, indeed,
   that as early as the month of January preceding, Messrs. Rankin and
   Shadford had seriously meditated on returning to England; for Mr.
   Asbury says, under date of January 22, that he met them at their
   request, and "found them inclined to leave America and embark for
   England. "But," he adds, "I had before resolved not to depart from the
   work on any consideration." About the middle of September, however,
   Messrs. Rankin and Rodda embarked for their native country.

   Notwithstanding the prudent caution given to the preachers by Mr.
   Wesley, in which he advised them not to meddle with the political
   affairs of the country, they did not all abide by it, but some were
   very busy in exciting a spirit of disaffection toward the American
   cause. That they should have felt strongly inclined to favor the cause
   of their king and country is but natural, and might very well be
   pardoned on the score of national partiality; but that any professed
   minister of Jesus Christ should have descended from his high and holy
   calling to mingle with the combatants of that day in their warlike
   measures, is a fault for which Christianity furnishes no apology. This,
   however, was the unhappy case with Mr. Rodda previously to his
   departure for England. While on his circuit he was detected in
   spreading the king's proclamation, and otherwise endeavoring to stir up
   a spirit of opposition to the American government. Fearing, however,
   the resentment of his enemies, by the assistance of some slaves he made
   his escape to the British fleet; and as Philadelphia was then in
   possession of the British army, he was sent thither, and from thence to
   his native land. His departure, therefore, was no cause of regret to
   the Methodists in this country.

   Another circumstance tended not a little to excite a spirit of
   persecution toward the Methodists. A backslider, by the name of
   Chauncey Clowe, succeeded in enlisting about three hundred men for the
   British standard, and before he was detected, was the means of shedding
   blood. He was, however, arrested, and finally hung as a rebel against
   the government. In the course of the examination, it was found that
   only two Methodists were engaged in this plot; and the remarks of
   Governor Rodney, who was friendly to our cause, to those of our enemies
   who had assiduously endeavored to fix upon them the foul mark of
   toryism, put them to silence, and obtained for our friends temporary
   relief.

   What made this war the more distressing was the fact, that in many
   parts of the country the people were divided among themselves in regard
   to the lawfulness or expediency of taking up arms against Great
   Britain. This led to domestic disputes, and not infrequently the father
   was against the son, and the daughter against the mother, and one
   neighbor against another. These things produced an irritation of spirit
   exceedingly unfriendly to the progress of pure religion. But that which
   exposed the Methodist preachers still more to the suspicions of their
   enemies, was the fact, that Mr. Wesley had published a pamphlet
   addressed to the Americans, in which he condemned their conduct, and
   justified the measures of the British cabinet. This well-meant endeavor
   of Mr. Wesley, though it may have had a good effect upon the societies
   under his care in Great Britain, had quite a deleterious influence upon
   the Methodists in this country. As some copies of this pamphlet found
   their way here, they tended to increase the irritation against the
   Methodist preachers, and to expose them to fresh insults. Though Mr.
   Wesley may be commended as a loyalist for his well-meant endeavors to
   convince the Americans that they were wrong in taking up arms against
   his king and country, yet we cannot but believe that he committed an
   error in thus interfering in the political affairs of this country, as
   it manifestly tended to increase the difficulties with which the
   preachers had to contend, without at all mitigating the evils resulting
   from the war which was then raging. Amid all these difficulties,
   however, Mr. Asbury stood his ground knowing that his "record was on
   high, and at his reward was with his God."

   Speaking of the of Mssrs. Rankin and Rodda, he says, "So we are left
   alone. But I leave myself in the hand of God, relying on his good
   providence to direct and protect us, persuaded that nothing will befall
   me but what shall conduce to his glory and my benefit."

   1778. On the 19th of May of this year the sixth conference was in
   Leesburgh, Va., at which time six new circuits were added, namely,
   Berkey, Fluvanna, James City, and Lunenburgh, in Virginia, and Carolina
   circuit in North Carolina was divided into thee, called Roanoke; Tar
   River, and New Hope; and five of the old circuits, on account of the
   war, were left from the minutes; these were New York, Philadelphia,
   Chester, Frederick, and Norfolk. Though there was an increase in the
   number of circuits, yet there was a decrease of 873 members, the whole
   number being 6095; and also of the preachers 29, being 5 less than last
   year.

   In order to insure obedience to the government, and to distinguish
   between friends and enemies, all were called upon to take an oath of
   allegiance to the state authorities in which they resided, and of
   course to abjure allegiance to the crown of Great Britain. To the
   taking this oath many of the preachers had conscientious scruples,
   which exposed them to many vexations, and obliged some of them to leave
   their stations. Mr. George Shadford, whose labors had been so
   abundantly blessed to the awakening and conversion of souls, after
   keeping a day of fasting and prayer in company with Mr. Asbury for
   divine direction, took his departure this year for England, leaving
   behind him the savor of a good name, and many happy souls as seals to
   his ministry.

   As Mr. Asbury could not persuade himself to take the required oath of
   allegiance to the state of Maryland, where he was in the first part of
   this year, he retired to the state of Delaware, where he found an
   asylum in the house of Judge White for nearly twelve months. While the
   storm of war was raging around him, and while all his English brethren
   had forsaken him and the flocks intrusted to their care, he determined
   to wait patiently until the tempest should subside, that he might again
   launch forth upon a calmer sea in quest of immortal souls. But though
   he was thus secluded from the pursuit of his enemies in the house of
   his friend and patron, Thomas White, Esq., he says, that except for
   about two months, when the necessity of the case compelled him,
   contrary to his most ardent wishes, to be silent, it was a "season of
   the most active, most useful, and suffering part of his life." Though
   he could not appear before the congregations on the Sabbath, he was
   wont to leave his retreat in the gloom of the night, and go from house
   to house to enforce the truths of the gospel; and notwithstanding the
   difficulties with which he and others had to contend in those times of
   trouble, they were gradually laying a foundation deep and broad, by
   their labors and sufferings, for that success which Methodism has since
   had in these United States.

   But Mr. Asbury was not the only sufferer on this occasion. Mr. Freeborn
   Garrettson was at that time actively and successfully engaged in
   preaching the gospel in Queen Anne's county, in the state of Maryland.,
   After having paid a visit to Mr. Asbury in his seclusion at Judge
   Whites, where he had an opportunity of preaching to a small company, he
   returned to Queen Anne's and preached. The next day, as he was on his
   way to Kent, be was met by one John Brown, formerly a judge of that
   county, who seized his horse's bridle; and notwithstanding the
   remonstrances of Mr. Garrettson, who assured him that he was on the
   Lord's errand, peaceably engaged in persuading sinners to be reconciled
   to God, Brown alighted from horse, seized a stick, and began beating
   Mr. Garrettson over the head and shoulders, in the meantime calling for
   help. As some were approaching, as he thought with a rope, Brown let go
   the bridle, when Mr. Garrettson gave his horse the whip, and thus
   cleared himself from the grasp of his persecutors. He was, however,
   soon overtaken by his pursuer, who struck at him with all his might,
   when Mr. Garrettson was thrown from his horse with great violence.
   Providentially a lady passed along with a lancet and he was taken to a
   house and bled, by which means he was restored to his senses, of which
   he had been deprived by the blows he had received, and the fall from
   his horse. He then began to exhort his persecutor, who fearing that
   death would ensue, exhibited some sorrow and great trepidation of
   heart, offering to take Mr. Garrettson in his carriage wherever he
   wanted to go. No sooner, however, did he perceive that the patient
   sufferer was likely to recover, than he brought a magistrate, more
   wicked the himself, both of whom, says Mr. Garrettson, "appeared as if
   actuated by the devil." The following is his own account of the
   termination of this affair: --

   "With a stern look the magistrate demanded my name. I told him; and he
   took out his pen and ink, and began to write a mittimus to commit me to
   jail. Pray, sir,' said I, are you a justice of the peace?' He replied
   that he was. Why, then,' said I, do you suffer men to behave in his
   manner? If such persons are not taken notice of, a stranger can with no
   degree of safety travel the road.' You have,' said he, broken the law.'
   How do you know that,' answered I; but suppose I have, is this the way
   to put the law in force against me? I am an inhabitant of this state,
   and have property in it; and, if I mistake not, the law says for the
   first offense, the fine is five pounds; and double for every offense
   after. The grand crime was preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus
   Christ, in which I greatly rejoice. My enemy,' said I, conducted
   himself more like a highwayman than a person enforcing the law in a
   Christian country. Be well assured, this matter will be brought light,'
   said I, in awful eternity.' He dropped his pen, and made no farther
   attempt to send me to prison. By this time, the woman who bled me came,
   with a carriage, and I found myself able to rise from my bed and give
   an exhortation to the magistrate, my persecutor, and others who were
   present."

   From this time Mr. Garrettson went on his way rejoicing in all the
   mighty things which the Lord did by his instrumentality; for he wrought
   wonderfully by his means in the states of Maryland and Delaware,
   through both of which he traveled extensively, And many flocked to hear
   the word.

   Mr. Joseph Hartley also, another traveling preacher, a man of great
   zeal and faithfulness, was apprehended in Queen Anne's county for
   preaching the gospel, who gave bonds and security to appear for trial
   at the next court. Being forbidden to preach, he attended his
   appointments; and after singing and prayer, stood upon his knees and
   exhorted the people, until his enemies said that he might as well
   preach, standing on his feet as on his knees. He went thence to Talbot
   county, where he was seized and committed to jail for "preaching Jesus
   and him crucified." This, however, by no means silenced him. The people
   collecting around the walls of his prison, he preached to them through
   the grates; and so powerfully was the word applied to their hearts,
   that some of them were deeply awakened to a sense of their lost and
   guilty state, and began earnestly to seek the Lord. This induced some
   of the inhabitants to remark that unless Hartley were released from
   prison he would convert the whole town. After keeping him confined for
   some time, he was set at liberty; but such had been the blessed effects
   of his preaching, that a powerful revival followed, which terminated in
   the establishment of a flourishing society in that place.

   In the latter part of this year, Mr. Asbury ventured from his seclusion
   and preached the gospel of the kingdom in various parts of Delaware
   state with such freedom and success, that he remarks, the "gospel meets
   with such indulgence in this free state," that it "will become as the
   garden of the Lord, filled with plants of his own planting." The truth
   of this anticipation has been fully verified.

   1779. -- Previously to the assembling of the conference, mentioned in
   the minutes for this year, the preachers in the more northerly states
   assembled at Judge White's, where Mr. Asbury had retired from the fury
   of his enemies, and there held a conference, with Mr. Asbury at their
   head, who now acted since the departure of Mr. Rankin and the other
   English preachers, by a vote of this conference, as the general
   assistant. Although this was considered as "a preparatory conference,"
   yet if we take into consideration that the one afterward held at the
   Broken Back Church, in Virginia, was held in the absence of the general
   assistant, we shall see good reason for allowing that this, which was
   held under the presidency of Mr. Asbury, was the regular conference,
   and hence their acts and doings are to be considered valid.

   This year was distinguished by considerable troubles in the societies.
   These arose principally from a desire manifested among the people in
   the south to have the ordinances administered to them. That we may
   understand this subject, it is necessary to remark, that the Methodist
   preachers, both in Europe and America, were considered only as
   lay-preachers, having never been separated to the work of the ministry
   by imposition of hands. Mr. Wesley's strong attachment to the
   established Church of England had induced him to oppose every thing
   which tended to a separation from her communion, or to a violation of
   any of her canons or ordinances. Hence, although frequently importuned
   to set apart some of his preachers by imposition of hands to the entire
   work of the ministry, he steadily resisted all such solicitations,
   exhorting his people to go to the Church for the ordinances of baptism
   and the Lord's supper. Mr. Asbury, and those English preachers who had
   been associated with him in this country, had been educated in the
   Wesleyan school, and hence had sternly resisted all attempts to depart,
   in this respect, from the principles and practice of their founder.

   As we have already seen, at an early period of Methodism in America,
   some of the preachers, and, probably through their influence, the
   people too, had manifested a strong desire to deviate from this course
   of conduct, and to have the ordinances among themselves. Mr. Asbury and
   his associates had resisted all such attempts at innovation,
   endeavoring to persuade the people to be content to receive the
   ordinances as they had done, from the hands of their parochial clergy.
   The question was agitated at the Deer Creek Conference, in 1777, where
   Mr. Rankin presided. Here the question was asked, "Shall the preachers
   in America administer the ordinances?" And after a full discussion, it
   was answered, "We will suspend them until the next conference." At the
   next conference, which was held in Leesburgh, Va., May 19, 1778, Mr.
   Asbury not being present on account of ill health, and Mr. Rankin and
   his British brethren having departed for England, Mr. William Watters,
   being the oldest American preacher, was called upon to preside. Here
   the question, "Shall we administer the ordinances?" was again
   discussed, and it was finally decided to "lay it over until the next
   conference."

   This "next conference" was the one we are now considering. Here the
   arguments in favor of administering the ordinances came up with double
   force. The war had separated them from Mr. Wesley; all the English
   preachers, except Mr. Asbury, had returned to England, and nearly all
   the ministers of the establishment, being unfriendly to the American
   cause, had also left their flocks and gone home; and most of those who
   remained were irregular in their lives and not evangelical in their
   preaching. In these circumstances, the children were left unbaptized
   and the people were destitute of the Lord's supper. They furthermore
   said, that as God had made them instrumental in the conversion of the
   souls of the people, so he had given them authority to administer his
   ordinances; and the people were exceedingly desirous "to have it so."

   It was under these views and feelings that the brethren assembled in
   Fluvanna county, Va. on the 18th of May, 1779. Knowing something of the
   disposition which prevailed there on this subject, Mr. Watters was sent
   from the conference which had been held at Judge White's, to endeavor
   to dissuade them from carrying their design into execution. His
   efforts, however, were unavailing; for after deliberating upon the
   subject, they appointed a committee of some of the oldest brethren to
   ordain ministers. The members of this committee first ordained each
   other, and then proceeded to ordain others by imposition of hands.
   Those who were thus ordained, went out preaching and administering the
   ordinances of baptism and the Lord's supper to all who desired them,
   either for themselves or for their children; an thus was a breach made
   between the northern and southern preachers. These men, however, being
   pious and zealous, and withal much favored by the people for complying
   with their wishes, were very successful in their labors; but the
   preachers at the north mourned over them on account of their departure
   from what they very justly considered Wesleyan Methodism.

   In consequence of this temporary division, there were two separate
   minutes taken in 1779, each conference passing its own resolutions, and
   stationing its preachers; but the numbers in society and of preachers
   are set down in the minutes of the Fluvanna conference. From these it
   appears, that, notwithstanding the ravages of the war, the opposition
   and persecution with which some of the preachers had to contend, and
   the dissensions among themselves respecting the ordinances, they had an
   increase of 2482 members and of 20 preachers; so greatly did the word
   God multiply and prevail in those troublesome times.

   At these conferences they passed resolutions that "every exhorter and
   local preacher should go under the direction of the assistants where,
   and only where, they shall appoint -- that they should "meet the
   children once a fortnight, and examine the parents in regard to their
   conduct toward them" -- and after having elected Mr. Asbury as the
   general assistant, they inserted this question and answer:

   "Question How far shall his power extend?

   Answer On hearing every preacher for and against what is in debate, the
   right of determination shall rest with him according to the minutes."
   These resolutions were adopted at the conference held at Judge White's,
   in the state of Delaware. It seems, therefore, that they were not in
   the habit at that time of determining debatable questions by a majority
   of votes; but, in imitation of the practice of Mr. Wesley, after
   hearing all that could be said pro and con, the presiding officer
   decided the point.

   The conference at Fluvanna determined to lengthen the time of trial of
   a preacher from one to two years, which has continued a standing rule
   to this day. They also declared that any preacher who received "money
   by subscription" was "excluded the Methodist connection." As these were
   the only rules which passed that body, except resolving to ordain
   ministers and to administer the ordinances, it is probable that they
   acquiesced in what was done by the other conference, which was held
   under the presidency of Mr. Asbury.

   1780. -- The eighth conference assembled in Baltimore, April 24th of
   this year. That our readers may see the spirit by which they were
   actuated, the following questions and answers are inserted as I find
   them in the printed minutes: --

   Question 7. Ought not all the assistants to see to the settling of all
   the preaching houses by trustees, and order the said trustees to meet
   once in half a year, and keep a register of their proceedings; if there
   are any vacancies choose new trustees, for the better security of the
   houses, and let all the deeds be drawn in substance after that in the
   printed minutes?

   Answer Yes.

   Question 8. Shall all the traveling preachers take a license from every
   conference, importing that they are assistants or helpers in connection
   with us?

   Answer Yes.

   Question 9. Shall brother Asbury sign them in behalf of the conference?

   Answer Yes.

   Question 10. Ought it to be strictly enjoined on all our local
   preachers and exhorters, that no one presume to speak in public without
   taking a note every quarter, (if required,) and be examined by the
   assistant with respect to his life, his qualification, and reception.

   Answer Yes.

   Question 11. Ought not all our preachers to make conscience of rising
   at four, and if not, yet at five: (is it not a shame for a preacher to
   be in bed till six in the morning?)

   Answer Undoubtedly they ought.

   Question 12. Shall we continue in close connection with the Church, and
   press our people to a closer connection with her?

   Answer Yes.

   Question 13. Will this conference grant the privilege to all the
   friendly clergy of the Church of England, at the request or desire of
   the people, to preach or administer the ordinances in our preaching
   houses or chapels?

   Answer Yes.

   Question 14. What provision shall we make for the wives of married
   preachers?

   Answer They shall receive an equivalent with their husbands in
   quarterage, if they stand in need.

   Question 15. Ought not our preachers, if possible, to speak to every
   person one by one in the families where they lodge, before prayer, if
   time will permit; or give a family exhortation after reading a chapter?

   Answer They ought.

   Question 16. Ought not this conference to require those traveling
   preachers who hold slaves, to give promises to set them free?"

   Answer Yes.

   Question 17. Does conference acknowledge that slavery is contrary to
   the law of God, man, and nature, and hurtful to society; contrary to
   the dictates of conscience and pure religion, and doing that which we
   would not others should do to us and ours? -- Do we pass our
   disapprobation on all our friends who keep slaves, and advise their
   freedom?

   Answer Yes.

   Question 18. Shall we recommend our quarterly meetings to be held on
   Saturdays and Sundays when convenient?

   Answer Agreed.

   Question 19. Shall not the Friday following every quarter day be
   appointed as a day of fasting?

   Answer Yes.

   Question 20. Does this whole conference disapprove the step our
   brethren have taken in Virginia? [giving American Methodist ministers
   authority to perform the ordinances of baptism and the Lord's supper --
   DVM]

   Answer Yes.

   Question 21. Do we look upon them no longer as Methodists in connection
   with Mr. Wesley and us till they come back? [8]

   Answer Agreed.

   Question 22. Shall brother Asbury, Garrettson, and Watters attend the
   Virginia conference, and inform them of our proceedings in this, and
   receive their answer?

   Answer Yes.

   Question 23. Do we disapprove of the practice of distilling grain into
   liquor? Shall we disown our friends who will not renounce the practice?

   Answer Yes.

   Question 24. What shall the conference do in case of brother Asbury's
   death or absence?

   Answer Meet once a year, and act according to the minutes.

   Question 25. Ought not the assistant to meet the colored people
   himself, and appoint as helpers in his absence proper white persons,
   and not suffer them to stay late and meet by themselves?

   Answer Yes.

   Question 26. What must be the conditions of our union with our
   Virginian brethren?

   Answer To suspend all their administrations for one year, and all meet
   together in Baltimore.

   On the minute respecting slavery, Mr. Lee, in his History of the
   Methodists, remarks, that "it was going too far, and calculated to
   irritate the minds of our people, and not to convince them of their
   errors." Of this the conferences were subsequently convinced, as they
   found it necessary to relax in their measures against slave-holders,
   without, however, attempting to justify the system of slavery itself.

   By these, minutes, it will also be seen that the preachers of that day
   set their faces against "distilling grain into liquor," determining to
   "disown those who would not renounce the practice."

   From this it may be seen that the Methodist conference set itself
   against the use of alcoholic liquors long before the temperance
   movements, which have so distinguished the present days, and which have
   conferred such lasting blessings upon the community. What a pity there
   should ever have been any relaxation either in the phraseology or
   enforcement of this rule! But that which affected them the most vitally
   was, the resolution respecting their Virginia brethren, who, it should
   he noted, did not convene with the Baltimore conference, but held one
   of their own in Virginia; but as their proceedings are not upon record,
   we cannot say what they did. As, however, this conference forms a very
   important item in the history of Methodism, in which Mr. Asbury took
   such a deep interest and agency, I will give his own account of the
   whole affair, as I find it recorded in his Journal under date of May
   8th, 9th, 10th 1780.

   "We rode to Granger's, fifteen miles, stopped and fed our horses. These
   people are full of the ordinances; we talked and prayed with them, then
   rode on to the Manakin-town ferry, much fatigued with the ride; went to
   friend Smith's, where all the preachers were met. I conducted myself
   with cheerful freedom, but found there was a separation in heart and
   practice. I spoke with my countryman, John Dickins, and found him
   opposed to our continuance in union with the Episcopal Church. Brother
   Watters and Garrettson tried their men, and found them inflexible.

   "Tuesday 9. -- The conference was called: brother Watters, Garrettson,
   and myself stood back, and being afterward joined by brother Dromgoole,
   we were desired to come in, and I was permitted to speak. I read Mr.
   Wesley's thoughts against a separation -- showed my private letters of
   instructions from Mr. Wesley -- set before them the sentiments of the
   Delaware and Baltimore conferences -- read our epistles, and read my
   letter to brother Gatch, and Dickins's letter in answer. After some
   time spent this way, it was proposed to me, if I would get the circuits
   supplied, they would desist; but that I could not do. We went to
   preaching; I spoke on Ruth ii, 4, and spoke as though nothing had been
   the matter among the preachers or people; and we were greatly pleased
   and comforted -- there was some moving among the people. In the
   afternoon we met; the preachers appeared to me to be farther off; there
   had been, I thought, some talking out of door. When we, Asbury,
   Garrettson, Watters and Dromgoole, could not come to a conclusion with
   them we withdrew, and left them to deliberate on the condition I
   offered, which was to suspend the measures they had taken for one year.
   After an hour's conference, we were called to receive their answer,
   which was, they could not submit to the terms of union. I then prepared
   to leave the house, to go to a near neighbor's to lodge, under the
   heaviest cloud I ever felt in America -- O! what I felt! -- nor I
   alone, but the agents on both sides! -- they wept like children, but
   kept their opinions.

   "Wednesday 10. -- I returned to take leave of conference, and to go off
   immediately to the north; but found they were brought to an agreement
   while I had been praying, as with a broken heart, in the house we went
   to lodge at; and brothers Watters and Garrettson had been praying up
   stairs where the conference sat. We heard what they had to say --
   surely the hand of God has been greatly seen in all this: there might
   have been twenty promising preachers, and three thousand people,
   seriously affected by this separation; but the Lord would not suffer
   this -- we then had preaching by brother Watters on, Come thou with us,
   and we will do thee good:' afterward we had a love-feast; preachers and
   people wept, prayed, and talked, so that the spirit of dissension was
   powerfully weakened, and I hoped it would never take again."

   This unhappy affair being thus amicably adjusted, the preachers went to
   their respective fields of labor with renewed courage; and although the
   clouds of war still hung lowering over all the land, and often
   threatened them with showers of persecution, yet those who became
   personally acquainted with them were so thoroughly convinced of the
   purity of their motives and conduct, and some of those being among the
   most influential men in the country, they threw around them the shield
   of their protection. Mr. Asbury being let loose from his confinement,
   traveled extensively through the southern counties of Virginia and some
   parts of North Carolina, exerting all his powers to promote the cause
   of God, and particularly to heal the divisions which had arisen from
   the disputes respecting the ordinances. Though the preachers all agreed
   to suspend their use for the present, yet a few of them being not a
   little pleased with their self-created authority, submitted to the
   measure with great reluctance, and many of the people surrendered their
   supposed privileges not without a struggle. Through his influence,
   however, and that of Mr. Garrettson, and some other influential men of
   peace and union, the breach was finally healed, and peace and love
   reigned throughout their borders.

   Some places, however, were much disturbed and distressed on account of
   the war, which now raged with increased violence. In consequence of the
   continual marching and countermarching of the armies, both of friends
   and enemies, some of the circuits were abandoned, and others but
   partially supplied. And although general protection was extended to the
   preachers, in conformity to the principles of civil and religious
   liberty for which the United States were now contending, yet there were
   not wanting individuals who, from various pretexts, stirred up a spirit
   of persecution against the Methodists. To those who were deeply
   interested in the success of our arms and who were actuated only by the
   blind impulses of human nature in its depraved state, it was provoking
   to find a people in the midst of them led on by a number of active and
   zealous preachers, who were from principle averse to war; for such was
   the case in respect to most of the preachers and people denominated
   Methodists. Add to this the fact, that their first leaders were
   directly from England, some of whom had not concealed their partiality
   for their mother country, and all under a leader who had boldly
   advocated the cause of his government, and denounced the Americans as
   rebels, it is no wonder that any one who wished to raise the wind of
   persecution against a Methodist preacher, need only shout Tory, and his
   wish was accomplished. To this disgraceful practice some resorted, and
   thereby gratified their unreasonable opposition to the men whom they
   inwardly hated on account of the spirited manner in which they rebuked
   them for their wickedness. Among others who suffered in this way, the
   most conspicuous was Mr. F. Garrettson. On the 27th of February of this
   year, after preaching to a numerous and attentive congregation in
   Dorchester county, he was seized by his enemies, and finally committed
   to prison. Though he suffered much in body in consequence of having no
   other bed than the floor, with his saddle bags for his pillow, with two
   large windows open upon him yet he enjoyed great spiritual consolation
   in prayer and meditation, reading and writing, and was not a little
   comforted by the visits and prayers of his friends and pious
   acquaintances.

   Before, however, his trial came on, Mr. Asbury went to the governor of
   Maryland and interceded behalf of Mr. Garrettson; and the governor of
   Delaware state, being a great friend to the Methodists, sent a letter
   of recommendation to the governor of Maryland, who immediately set him
   at liberty. Though the enemies of the cross of Christ in Dorchester
   county were much dissatisfied with his liberation, yet the authority of
   their governor prevailed over their opposition, and Mr. Garrettson
   immediately recommenced his favorite work of preaching the gospel, and
   "the word of the Lord," says he, "spread through all that country, and
   hundreds, both white and black, experienced the love of Jesus," so that
   not far from the very place where he was imprisoned, he soon after
   preached to a congregation of not less than three thousand people, and
   many of his bitterest persecutors were among the happy converts to the
   truth.

   From the minutes of the conference it appears there was a decrease of
   members of seventy-three, and of preachers seven; the number being,
   preachers forty-two, members eight thousand five hundred and four.

   1781. It seems that the conference this year was begun at Choptank, in
   the state of Delaware, April 16, and adjourned to Baltimore, to the
   24th of the same month. The following are assigned as the reasons for
   this measure: -- "To examine those who could not go to Baltimore, and
   to provide supplies for the circuits where the Lord is more immediately
   pouring out his Spirit." With a view to secure greater unanimity of
   sentiment and action, thirty-nine out of fifty-four preachers set their
   names to a paper, expressive of their determination to "preach the old
   Methodist doctrine, and strictly to enforce the discipline as contained
   in the notes, sermons, and minutes published by Mr. Wesley," and "to
   discountenance a separation among either preachers or people."

   They also passed a rule respecting local preachers, forbidding their
   traveling circuits without consulting Mr. Asbury, or the assistant near
   where he resides; also providing that no excluded person should be
   readmitted without giving evidence of repentance; and a third making it
   the duty of preachers to read often the Rules of the Societies, the
   Character of a Methodist, and the Plain Account of Christian
   Perfection.

   This year the following rule was adopted for settling disputes which
   might arise between brethren in their dealings with each other: "Let
   the assistant preacher at quarterly meeting consult with the steward,
   in appointing proper persons to examine into the circumstances, and if
   there be any suspicion of injustice, or inability in the referees, to
   appoint men of more skill and probity, and the parties to abide by
   their decision, or be excluded the society." They likewise appointed
   the first Thursday in June, September, January, and April, as days of
   general fasting.

   For the first time, the following question and answer were recorded: --

   "Question Who desist from traveling this year?

   "Answer John Dickins, Isham Tatum, William Moore, Greenberry Green,
   Daniel Ruff."

   Notwithstanding the ravages of the war, which raged this year with most
   violence in the southern states, the Lord greatly blessed the labors of
   his faithful and devoted servants, particularly in the states of
   Maryland and Delaware, as well as in some parts of Virginia and North
   Carolina; but some of the circuits in these latter places were so
   harassed with hostile armies, that they were not accessible to the
   preachers; and many of the members, though much averse to war, were
   obliged to serve in the American army, by which means some lost their
   lives, others made "shipwreck of faith and a good conscience," and all
   were less or more injured in their religious character and enjoyments.
   Those who were so entirely opposed to war from principle as utterly to
   refuse to fight, were whipped, or fined and imprisoned, and persecuted
   in a variety of ways. And such were the anxieties manifested by the
   people respecting the final issue of the contest, particularly in
   Virginia, where the bloody conflict was renewed this year with
   increased violence, that when they did assemble for divine worship,
   their conversation turned more upon the political situation of the
   country, and the probable results of the war, than upon religion;
   fathers and mothers were anxious for the fate of their sons who were in
   the army, and wives for their husbands.

   But though these things exerted an injurious influence upon
   individuals, and in some places upon whole societies, yet, as a body,
   they prospered, so much so that the increase was not less than two
   thousand and thirty-five, and of preachers twelve.

   Among others who contributed to advance the cause of God was the Rev.
   Mr. Jarratt, before mentioned. He attended the conference, preached to
   the people with great power and acceptance, gave his advice in matters
   of importance, and administered the ordinances of baptism and the
   Lord's supper. Of his services Mr. Asbury makes honorable mention in
   his Journal for this year. After speaking of preaching in his barn he
   says, Mr. Jarratt seemed all life, and I determined to spend himself in
   the work of God, and visit what circuits he could."

   This year has been rendered famous in the annals of our country by the
   capture of the British army under the command of Lord Cornwallis at
   Yorktown, Virginia. This event gave a pleasing hope to the friends of
   peace on both sides of the Atlantic -- and to none more than to the
   Methodists -- that this war, which had so long desolated the continent,
   would soon come to an end; while American patriots hailed this as an
   auspicious event, bringing with it a sure pledge of future prosperity.

   1782. The tenth conference commenced in Ellis's preaching house, Va.,
   April 17, and by adjournment in Baltimore, May 21. This was done to
   accommodate the preachers; but as that held in Baltimore was the
   oldest, nothing that was done in the Virginia conference was considered
   binding, unless sanctioned by this conference.

   Preachers this year, 59; (Preachers last year, 54); Members, 11,785;
   (Members last year, 10,539); Increase in Preachers, 5; Increase in
   Members, 1,246.

   The appointment of Mr. Asbury by Mr. Wesley as general assistant was
   reconfirmed at this conference by a unanimous vote, After passing
   sundry rules for the better regulation of themselves and the people of
   their charge, the following was entered upon the minutes: --

   "The conference acknowledge their obligations to the Rev. Mr. Jarratt,
   for his kind and friendly services to the preachers and people, from
   our first entrance into Virginia, and more particularly for attending
   our conference in Sussex, in public and private; and advise the
   preachers in the south to consult him and take his advice in the
   absence of brother Asbury."

   At this conference they re-resolved to abide by the decision formerly
   made, not to administer the ordinances. To supply this deficiency, Mr.
   Jarratt proffered his services, attended some of their quarterly
   meetings, administered the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's supper,
   and otherwise assisted them in their work of spreading the gospel among
   the people. Hence the above acknowledgment of his services.

   Only two circuits, Lancaster, in Pennsylvania, and South Branch, in
   Virginia, had been added during the past year. Nor do we find any thing
   special in reference to the general state of the societies; but there
   was a considerable outpouring of the Spirit in the northern parts of
   Virginia and in some parts of Maryland. For the first time they
   determined when and where the next conference should be held, namely,
   in Virginia the first Thursday, and in Baltimore the last Wednesday in
   May. Considering the state of the country, the societies in general
   were prosperous, and much united together.

   1783. On the 6th of May the eleventh conference assembled at Ellis'
   preaching house in Virginia, and by adjournment in Baltimore on the
   27th of the same month.

   Preachers this year, 82; (Preachers last year, 59); Members, 13,740;
   (Members last year, 11,789); Increase in Preachers, 23; Increase in
   Members, 1,955.

   We find them at this conference ordering the sum two hundred and sixty
   pounds to be raised for the support of the preachers' wives. The
   following rules were passed on the subject of slavery, and on the
   manufacturing and drinking spirituous liquors: --

   "Question What shall be done with our local preachers who hold slaves
   contrary to the laws which authorize their freedom in any of the United
   States.

   "Answer We will try them another year. In the meantime, let every
   assistant deal faithfully and plainly with every one, and report to the
   next conference. It may be necessary to suspend them.

   "Question Should our friends be permitted to make spirituous liquors,
   sell, and drink them in drams.

   "Answer By no means. We think it wrong in its natural consequences and
   desire all our preachers to teach our people, by precept and example,
   to put away this evil."

   The first Thursdays in July and October were appointed as days of
   thanksgiving "for our public peace, temporal and spiritual prosperity,
   and for the glorious work of God:" and the first Fridays in January and
   April were set apart as days of fasting and prayer.

   After appointing the next conference to be held in the city of
   Baltimore on the fourth Thursday in May, 1784, they ordered that "the
   assistants and those who were to be received into full connection,"
   should attend. This is the first time that we find on record any rule
   respecting who should attend the conference.

   Richard Garrettson, Micaijah Debruler, and Samuel Watson, desisted from
   traveling.

   They could not but be thankful to the great Head of the Church for
   sending peace in their borders, by which means the restraints which had
   been imposed, in many places, upon the preachers were taken off, and
   they were therefore permitted to travel wherever they pleased, and to
   preach the gospel to whomsoever they might find willing to hear it. The
   consequence was that their borders were greatly enlarged on every hand,
   both in the older and new settlements.

   On hearing this glorious news, Mr. Asbury, who, perhaps, had suffered
   as much as any of the preachers for conscience' sake, makes the
   following reflections:

   "April 5, I heard the news that peace was confirmed between England and
   America. I had various exercises of mind on the occasion: it may cause
   great changes to take place among us; some for the better and some for
   the worse. It may make against the work of God. Our preachers will be
   far more likely to settle in the world; and our people, by getting into
   trade and acquiring wealth, may drink into its spirit. Believing the
   report to be true, I took some notice of it while I treated on Acts x,
   36, at brother Clayton's, near Halifax, where they were firing their
   cannon and rejoicing in their way on the occasion."

   These certainly are very chastened exultations in a man who had
   suffered so much from the calamities of war, and must, therefore, have
   enjoyed some bright anticipations from the return of peace; but they
   show with what moderation he received every temporal mercy, lest it
   might, by its abuse, become an occasion of a sinful conformity to the
   spirit and temper of this world.

   The Methodist societies, however, soon began to witness the beneficial
   results from this termination of hostilities, in the enlargement of
   their work, and in the facilities afforded to the preachers to
   itinerate through the country. During the war many had moved from the
   more immediate scene of the conflict to the back settlements, where
   they were destitute of the word and ordinances of religion. On the
   return, of peace, these were visited by the preachers, while the older
   circuits, some of which had been either entirely, or partially
   abandoned during the war, were now regularly supplied; and the
   consequence of these salutary movements was, a more diffusive spread of
   the gospel, and the bringing the societies into greater compactness and
   order under their disciplinary regulations. Hence pure religion greatly
   revived in almost every direction, while several additional laborers
   entered the field of itinerancy. That success attended their labors is
   manifest from the fact that the increase to the numbers in society was,
   as before stated, one thousand nine hundred and fifty-five, and that
   eleven new circuits were taken into the work. These were Caroline and
   Anamessex, in Maryland; Allegheny, Cumberland, and Holstein, in
   Virginia; Guilford, Caswell, Salisbury, Marsh, Bertie, and Pasquotank,
   in North Carolina; Norfolk and New York, which had been left destitute
   in consequence of having been in possession of the British troops, were
   again supplied with preachers.

   The intercourse between England and the United States being restored on
   the return of peace, it was feared that men of exceptionable character
   might be induced to emigrate from that to this country, and endeavor to
   palm themselves upon the people as Methodists or preachers. To prevent
   impositions of this sort, the present conference passed the following
   rule: --

   "We will not receive them," (European Methodists) "without a letter of
   recommendation, the truth of which we have no reason to doubt."

   They were much strengthened in this resolution by receiving, in the
   latter part of this year, the following letter from Mr. Wesley: --

   Bristol, Oct., 1783
    1. Let all of you be determined to abide by the Methodist doctrine and
       discipline, published in the four volumes of Sermons, and the Notes
       upon the New Testament, together with the large minutes of
       conference.
    2. Beware of preachers coming from Great Britain or Ireland without a
       full recommendation from me. Three of our traveling preachers here
       eagerly desired to go to America; but I could not approve of it by
       any means; because I am not satisfied that they thoroughly like
       either our discipline or our doctrine; I think they differ from our
       judgment in one or both. Therefore if these or any others come
       without my recommendation, take care how you receive them.
    3. Neither should you receive any preachers, however recommended, who
       will not be subject to the American conference, and cheerfully
       conform to the minutes both of the American and English
       conferences.
    4. I do not wish our American brethren to receive any who make any
       difficulty on receiving Francis Asbury as the general assistant.

   "Undoubtedly, the greatest danger to the work of God in America is
   likely to arise either from preachers coming from Europe, or from such
   as will arise from among yourselves, speaking perverse things, or
   bringing in among you new doctrines, particularly Calvinian. You should
   guard against this with all possible care, for it is far easier to keep
   them out than to thrust them out.

   "I commend you all to the grace of God, and am your affectionate friend
   and brother,

   "John Wesley."

   It was not to be expected that all who made profession of religion
   should adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour, nor that all who
   professed to be called of God to preach the gospel should stand fast in
   their calling, giving no occasion of offense. Mr. Asbury, in his
   Journal for this year, gives an affecting account of the apostasy and
   sudden death of Isaac Rawlings, who had been employed for eight or ten
   years as a preacher, but who furnished evidence of his instability at
   various times. He finally, after striving in a secret way, to make a
   party for himself, left the connection, and he and his adherents took
   possession of the Forest chapel. He was, however, soon forsaken by his
   followers, and became irregular in his life, lost the confidence of the
   public, and after having spent some hours in writing a defense of
   himself against some scandalous imputations which had been cast upon
   his character, mounted a "mettlesome horse, and had not rode many yards
   before he was thrown to the ground and died on the spot." "I had said,"
   says Mr. Asbury, "I think he cannot stay long, because he did pervert
   the right ways of the Lord."

   1784. -- On the 30th of April, the twelfth conference began at Ellis's
   chapel, in Virginia, and closed at Baltimore on the 28th of May
   following.

   Preachers this year, 83; (Preachers last year, 82); Members, 14,986;
   (Members last year, 13,740); Increase in Preachers, 1; Increase in
   Members, 1,248.

   David Abbott, James Thomas, James Mallory, and John Coleman, desisted
   from traveling; and Henry Medcalf and William Wright had died. This is
   the first time we find an account taken of those who had died, and
   nothing more is said of them than simply to record their deaths.

   Among other things, they passed resolutions to collect money by a
   general yearly subscription in every circuit toward building new
   chapels, and discharging the debts on those already erected -- to carry
   the rule passed last year on slavery into execution, except in Virginia
   -- to improve the singing, by keeping close to Mr. Wesley's tunes and
   hymns -- and to conform to his advice respecting receiving European
   Methodist preachers, as expressed in the preceding letter.

   There was a considerable revival this year in some of the frontier
   settlements, and the prospects of future usefulness were brightening
   every day, the preachers and people feeling the beneficial effects of
   the new government, which had been established after the loss of so
   much blood and treasure.

   Mr. Lee, in his History of the Methodists, informs us that to this time
   they had not printed the minutes, but preserved them only in
   manuscript. They have since, however, been collected and printed; and
   it is from these printed minutes that the principal facts in respect to
   the doings of the conferences have been taken.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [6] As it is my intention to give a condensed account of such preachers
   as were any way eminent for their labors, sufferings, and success, when
   their death is noticed, no more will be said of them in the thread of
   the history than is necessary to a connected account of the work which
   was carried on by their instrumentality.

   [7] It is said, however, in a memoir of the Rev. Mr. Mann, a preacher
   who afterward went to Nova Scotia, that for a considerable time during
   the war, at the request of the trustees and leaders, he held meetings
   in the chapel in New York, until he was relieved by the coming of Mr.
   Spragg, a regular traveling preacher, who came from Philadelphia, after
   the British took possession of that city. Through the labors of those
   men of God a small society was kept together, notwithstanding the
   difficulties with which they had to contend in those troublesome time.

   [8] This refers to a partial separation which took place in Virginia on
   account of the ordinances.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 3

    An account of the organization of the Methodist Episcopal Church, with some
    arguments in its defense.

   We have arrived at a very important period in the history of Methodism
   in this country. And as so much has been said respecting the
   constituting of the Methodist societies here into an independent
   church, I shall, in the first place, give a detail of the facts in the
   case, and, secondly, offer some arguments in defense of the measure.

   I. Hitherto the Methodists, both in Europe and America, had been
   considered as a society within a church -- in Great Britain they
   considered themselves as members of the establishment -- in America as
   members of that denomination to which they might be attached. The
   preachers in both hemispheres, not having been consecrated to their
   work by the imposition of hands, were distinguished as "lay-preachers,"
   and had not, except in the instance heretofore narrated, presumed to
   administer the ordinances of baptism and the Lord's supper. Under these
   circumstances much uneasiness had been manifested both in Europe and
   America, more especially here. But all solicitation, whether from the
   preachers or people, for the establishment of a separate church, had
   been strenuously resisted by Mr. Wesley, as being foreign to his
   primary design, and incompatible with the principles he had avowed from
   the beginning of his ministry. He commenced his ministerial, labor with
   the single intention of reviving evangelical religion in the Church, by
   preaching her doctrines and enforcing her discipline. This was the
   state of things at the time of which we are now speaking.

   As, however, the colonies had now become an independent government, no
   longer under the control of Great Britain, either in civil or
   ecclesiastical matters, Mr. Wesley began to relax from the sternness
   with which he had heretofore resisted the solicitations of the American
   Methodists, and to think seriously of granting their requests; and
   after consulting with his most intimate friends respecting the
   propriety of the measure -- for of its lawfulness he had no doubt -- he
   resolved to grant their request, and adopted means to carry the
   resolution into effect. "At the conference held in Leeds, in 1784, he
   declared his intention of sending Dr. Coke and some other preachers to
   America. Mr. Richard Whatcoat and Mr. Thomas Vasey offered themselves
   as missionaries for that purpose, and were accepted. Before they
   sailed, Mr. Wesley abridged the Common Prayer Book of the Church of
   England, and wrote to Dr. Coke, then in London, desiring him to meet
   him in Bristol, to receive fuller powers, and to bring the Rev. Mr.
   Creighton with him. The doctor and Mr. Creighton accordingly met him in
   Bristol when, with their assistance, he ordained Mr. Richard Whatcoat
   and Mr. Thomas Vasey presbyters for America; and being peculiarly
   attached to every rite of the Church of England, he afterward ordained
   Dr. Coke a superintendent, giving him letters of ordination under his
   hand and seal, and at the same time the following letter, to be printed
   and circulated in America: " [9]

   "Bristol, Sept. 10th, 1784

   To Dr. Coke, Mr. Asbury, and our Brethren in North America:
    1. By a very uncommon train of providences, many of the provinces of
       North America are totally disjoined from the British empire, and
       erected into independent states. The English government has no
       authority over them, either civil or ecclesiastical, any more than
       over the states of Holland. A civil authority is exercised over
       them, partly by the congress, partly by the state assemblies. But
       no one either exercises or claims any ecclesiastical authority at
       all. In this peculiar situation some thousands of the inhabitants
       of these states desire my advice: and in compliance with their
       desire I have drawn up a little sketch.
    2. Lord King's Account of the Primitive Church convinced me, many
       years ago, that bishops and presbyters are the same order, and
       consequently have the same right to ordain. For many years I have
       been importuned from time to time to exercise this right, by
       ordaining part of our traveling preachers. But I have still
       refused, not only for peace' sake, but because I was determined, as
       little as possible to violate the established order of the national
       Church, to which I belonged.
    3. But the case is widely different between England and North America.
       Here there are bishops who have a legal jurisdiction. In America
       there are none, and but few parish ministers: so for some hundred
       miles together there is none either to baptize or to administer the
       Lord's supper. Here, therefore, my scruples are at an end: and I
       conceive myself at full liberty, as I violate no order and invade
       no man's right, by appointing and sending laborers into the
       harvest.
    4. I have accordingly appointed Dr. Coke and Mr. Francis Asbury, to be
       joint superintendents [10] over our brethren in North America. As
       also Richard Whatcoat and Thomas Vasey to act as elders among them,
       by baptizing and ministering the Lord's supper.
    5. If any one will point out a more rational and Scriptural way of
       feeding and guiding those poor sheep in the wilderness, I will
       gladly embrace it. At present I cannot see any better method than
       that I have taken.
    6. It has indeed been proposed to desire the English bishops to ordain
       part of our preachers for America. But to this I object,

    1. I desired the bishop of London to ordain one only; but could not
       prevail:
    2. If they consented, we know the slowness of their proceedings; but
       the matter admits of no delay:
    3. If they would ordain them now, they would likewise expect to govern
       them. And how grievously would this entangle us!
    4. As our American brethren are now totally disentangled both from the
       state and from the English hierarchy, we dare not entangle them
       again; either with the one or the other. They are now at full
       liberty simply to follow the Scriptures and the primitive church.
       And we judge it best that they should stand fast in that liberty
       wherewith God has so strangely made them free. John Wesley."

   The following is the letter of ordination which Mr. Wesley gave to Dr.
   Coke: "To all to whom these presents shall come, John Wesley, late
   Fellow of Lincoln College, in Oxford, Presbyter of the Church of
   England, sendeth greeting:

   "Whereas many of the people in the southern provinces of North America,
   who desire to continue under my care, and still adhere to the doctrine
   and discipline of the Church of England, are greatly distressed for
   want of ministers to administer the sacraments of baptism and the
   Lord's supper, according to the usage of the same Church, and where as
   there does not appear to be any other way of supplying them with
   ministers:

   "Know all men, that I, John Wesley, think myself to providentially
   called at this time to set apart some persons for the work of the
   ministry in America And, therefore, under the protection of Almighty
   God, and with a single eye to his glory, I have this day set apart as a
   superintendent, by the imposition of my hands, and prayer, (being
   assisted by other ordained ministers,) Thomas Coke, Dr. of civil law, a
   presbyter of the Church of England, and a man whom I judge to be well
   qualified for that great work. And I do hereby recommend him to all
   whom it may concern, as a fit person to preside over the flock of
   Christ. In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal, this
   second day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven
   hundred and eighty-four.

   "John Wesley."

   Being thus furnished with the proper credentials, in the month of
   September Dr. Coke, in company with Messrs. Whatcoat and Vasey, set
   sail for America, and landed in the city of New York on the 3d of
   November, 1784. From thence they proceeded through Philadelphia to the
   state of Delaware, where, on the 15th day of the same month, he met Mr.
   Asbury at Barratt's chapel. Mr. Asbury gives the following account of
   this meeting: --

   "Sunday 15. I came to Barratt's chapel. Here, to my great joy, I met
   those dear men of God, Dr. Coke and Richard Whatcoat. We were greatly
   comforted together. The doctor preached on Christ our wisdom,
   righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Having had no
   opportunity of conversing with them before public worship, I was
   greatly surprised to see brother Whatcoat assist by taking the cup in
   the administration of the sacrament. I was shocked when first informed
   of the intention of these my brethren in coming to this country: it may
   be of God. My answer then was, If the preachers unanimously choose me,
   I shall not act in the capacity I have hitherto done by Mr. Wesley's
   appointment. The design of organizing the Methodists into an
   independent Episcopal Church was opened to the preachers present, and
   it was agreed to call a general conference, to meet at Baltimore the
   ensuing Christmas; as also that brother Garrettson go off to Virginia
   to give notice thereof to the brethren in the south."

   According to this arrangement, Mr. Garrettson set off immediately on
   his southern journey, sending letters to those he could not see; and
   Dr. Coke spent the intermediate time in visiting various parts of the
   country and preaching to the people. On Friday the 26th, Mr. Asbury
   says, "I observed this day as a day of fasting and prayer, that I might
   know the will of God in the matter; that is to come before the
   conference. The preachers and people seem to be much pleased with the
   projected plan; I myself am led to think it is of the Lord. I am not
   tickled with the honor to be gained. I see danger in the way. My soul
   waits upon God. O that he may lead us in the way we should go!"

   In conformity with the above arrangement, December 25th, sixty out of
   the eighty-three preachers then in the traveling connection, assembled
   in the city of Baltimore for the conference, in which Dr. Coke
   presided, assisted by Mr. Asbury; and the first act of the conference
   was, by a unanimous vote, to elect Dr. Coke and Francis Asbury as
   general superintendents; for although Mr. Asbury had been appointed to
   that high office by Mr. Wesley, yet he declined acting in that capacity
   independently of the suffrages of his brethren over whom he must
   preside. After his election, being first ordained a deacon, then an
   elder, Mr. Asbury was consecrated by Dr. Coke, assisted by several
   elders, to the office of a superintendent, in the manner set forth in
   the following certificate: --

   "Know all men by these presents, That I, Thomas Coke, Doctor of civil
   law, late of Jesus College, in the university of Oxford, presbyter of
   the Church of England, and superintendent of the Methodist Episcopal
   Church in America; under the protection of Almighty God, and with a
   single eye to his glory; by the imposition of my hands and prayer,
   (being assisted by two ordained elders,) did on the twenty-fifth day of
   this month, December, set apart Francis Asbury for the office of a
   deacon in the aforesaid Methodist Episcopal Church. And also on the
   twenty-sixth day of the said month, did, by the imposition of my hands
   and prayer, (being assisted by the said elders,) set apart the said
   Francis Asbury for the office of elder in the said Methodist Episcopal
   Church. And on this twenty-seventh day of the said month, being the day
   of the date hereof, have, by the imposition of my hands and prayer,
   (being assisted by the said elders,) set apart the said Francis Asbury
   for the office of a superintendent in the said Methodist Episcopal
   Church, a man whom I judge to be well qualified for that great work.
   And I do hereby recommend him to all whom it may concern, as a fit
   person preside over the flock of Christ. In testimony whereof I have
   hereunto set my hand and seal, this 27th day of December, in the year
   of our Lord 1784.

   "Thomas Coke."

   One of the elders who assisted at the consecration of Mr. Asbury, was
   the Rev. Mr. Otterbine, a minister of the German Church. Having enjoyed
   an intimate acquaintance with this pious and evangelical minister of
   Jesus Christ, and having full fellowship with him as a laborious and
   useful servant of God, Mr. Asbury requested that he might be associated
   with Dr. Coke and the other elders in the performance of this solemn
   ceremony.

   The following persons were elected, twelve of whom were consecrated
   elders: Freeborn Garrettson, William Gill, Le Roy Cole, John Hagerty,
   James O. Cromwell, John Tunnel, Nelson Reed, Jeremiah Lambert, Reuben
   Ellis, James O'Kelly, Richard Ivey, Beverly Allen, [11] and Henry
   Willis. Mr. Garrettson and Mr. Cromwell were set apart especially for
   Nova Scotia, to which place they soon after went; and their labors and
   success will be noticed in the proper place. Mr. Lambert was ordained
   for the Island of Antigua, in the West Indies.

   John Dickins, Caleb Boyer, and Ignatus Pigman, were elected deacons.

  II. Having thus given an account of these transactions, we proceed to offer a
  few arguments in their defense. Let it be recollected,

   1. That there was, a loud call for these things. Most of the clergy of
   the English Church, during the revolution, had fled from their flocks;
   and those who remained, with very few exceptions, were fit for any
   thing rather than ministers of the gospel. From the hands of such men
   the Methodists felt unwilling to receive the ordinances. As to the
   Presbyterians and Congregationalists, they would neither baptize the
   children unless at least one of the parents professed faith in their
   doctrines, nor admit them to the communion table unless they became
   members of their church. The Baptists were more rigid still, as they
   could fellowship none unless they had been baptized by immersion. To
   neither of these conditions could the Methodists submit. Besides, by
   these denominations, the Methodists were treated as heretics, on
   account of their opposition to the Calvinistic doctrine of decrees, and
   the final perseverance of the saints. Hence a necessity, originating
   from the state of things in this country, compelled the Methodists
   either to remain without the ordinances, to administer them by
   unconsecrated hands, or to provide for them in the manner they did.
   Those who disclaim all dependence upon the argument derived from the
   necessity of the case, would do well to inquire whether any man can be
   justified in doing an unnecessary work -- a work that might be
   scripturally dispensed with. It appears to the writer, that if there be
   no weight in this argument, then it follows that Mr. Wesley, and those
   who acted with him in this solemn affair were guilty of a work of
   supererogation, and therefore cannot be justified on any principle
   whatever, either of Scripture, reason, or conscience.

   2. Let it be recollected also, that those who consecrated Richard
   Whatcoat and Thomas Vasey, namely, Mr. Wesley, Dr. Coke, and Mr.
   Creighton, were all regular presbyters in the Church of England; and
   that those who laid hands on Dr. Coke, and set him apart as a
   superintendent of the Methodist Episcopal church in America, were also
   presbyters regularly ordained to that office.

   3. It appears manifest from several passages of Scripture, particularly
   Acts xiii, 1, 2, and I Tim. iv, 14 , and the testimonies of the
   primitive fathers of the church, that presbyters and bishops were of
   the same order, and that they originally possessed the power of
   ordination.

   4. The doctrine of uninterrupted succession from the apostles, in a
   third order, by a triple consecration, as distinct from and superior to
   presbyters, has been discarded by many of the most eminent
   ecclesiastical writers, as resting upon no solid foundation, not being
   susceptible of proof from any authentic source.

   5. Mr. Wesley possessed a right over the Methodists which no man else
   did or could possess, because they were his spiritual children, raised
   up under his preaching and superintendence, and hence they justly
   looked to him for a supply of the ordinances of Jesus Christ.

   6. Therefore in exercising the power with which the divine Head of the
   Church had invested him, he invaded no other man's right, nor yet
   assumed that which did not belong to him.

   7. Hence he did not, as the objection which this argument is designed
   to refute supposes, ordain either presbyters or a bishop for the
   English Church, nor for any other church then existing, but simply and
   solely for the Methodist societies in America. And therefore in doing
   this necessary work, he neither acted inconsistently with himself as a
   presbyter of the Church of England, nor incompatible with his frequent
   avowals to remain in that Church, and not to separate from it.

   8. For in fact, in organizing the Methodist Episcopal Church he did not
   separate either from the English or Protestant Episcopal Church; for
   that Church had no jurisdiction here, and the Methodist was organized
   some time before the Protestant Episcopal Church had an existence.
   Hence he acted perfectly consistent with himself, with all his avowals
   of attachment to the Church of England, while he proceeded to organize
   a church here; for while he did this, and thereby established a
   separate and independent church in America, where the English Church
   had no jurisdiction, he and his people in England still remained
   members of the Establishment.

   9. While the Scriptures are silent in respect to the particular form of
   church government which should be established, they certainly allow of
   an Episcopal form, because it is not incompatible with any known
   precept or usage of primitive Christianity.

   10. This is farther manifest from the fact, that the apostles and
   evangelists did exercise a jurisdiction over the entire church,
   presbyters, deacons, and people, though at the same time there is no
   proof that as to order, created such by a third consecration, they were
   higher than the presbyters.

   11. Distinguishing, therefore, between the power of ordination and the
   power of jurisdiction, we may see how an Episcopal government may be
   created by a presbyerial ordination, and hence justify the act of Mr.
   Wesley and his associates in setting apart Dr. Coke to the office of a
   general superintendent.

   These arguments are merely stated here as the grounds on which the
   organization of the Methodist Episcopal Church is justified, referring
   the reader who may wish to see them in detail, with the proofs on which
   they rest for support, to the book recently published, called "An
   Original Church of Christ." In that performance he will see all
   objections met, and I trust fully answered, and the proceedings of Mr.
   Wesley and his co-workers amply vindicated.

   12. Another ground of defense is in the character of those who were
   employed in this transaction. As to the Rev. John Wesley, it is almost
   needless now to say any thing in his commendation. In him were
   concentrated all the elements of a great man and by a conscientious
   improvement of his gifts, having been made a partaker of "like precious
   faith," he was as much distinguished by his goodness as by his
   greatness; but all his other endowments were propelled on by his
   inextinguishable thirst for the salvation of his fellow-men, and fully
   employed, as an evangelist, in the grand cause of Jesus Christ. And
   such were the effects of these labors, that at the time of which we are
   now speaking there were no less than sixty-four thousand one hundred
   and fifty-five members of society, and one hundred and ninety-five
   preachers in Europe; and fourteen thousand nine hundred and
   eighty-eight members, and eighty-three preachers in America; making in
   all seventy-nine thousand one hundred and forty-three members, and two
   hundred and seventy-eight preachers. These had been raised up through
   his instrumentality in the short space of forty-five years, as seals to
   his ministry, and as evidences of his call to the work in which he was
   engaged. Of his call, therefore, and qualification for the work of an
   evangelist, there can be no doubt, any more than there should be of his
   right, as the spiritual father of this numerous family, to provide them
   with all the means of grace.

   And as Dr. Thomas Coke took an active and conspicuous part in the
   organization and establishment of the Methodist Episcopal Church, it
   seems proper that a short account should be given of him in this place.
   He received his education at the university of Oxford, and though in
   his early days he was infected with infidel principles, yet by reading
   the works of Bishop Sherlock, he was convinced of the truth of
   Christianity, and was ordained first a deacon and then a presbyter in
   the Church of England. But like most of the clergy in that day, he was
   a stranger to experimental godliness. Hearing, however, of Mr. Wesley,
   he sought and obtained an interview with that apostolic man, and by him
   was instructed more perfectly in the ways of the Lord. Not long after
   he fully joined himself with Mr. Wesley, was made a partaker of
   justification by faith in Jesus Christ and became an active and zealous
   assistant to the founder of Methodism. For about six years previous to
   his sailing to America, he had given full proof of his zealous
   attachment to the cause of Christ, of his love to Methodist doctrine
   and discipline, and of his entire devotedness to the best interests of
   mankind. This was the man on whom Mr. Wesley fixed to carry the designs
   toward his American brethren into execution. And though it may be said
   that the doctor was somewhat precipitate in some of his movements, yet
   it is certain that he gave evidence of the most ardent piety; of a
   chastened zeal in the cause of God, and of deep devotion to the
   interests of the Redeemer.

   Of the Rev. Mr. Creighton it is enough to say, that he was a regularly
   ordained presbyter of the Church of England, a man of a sound mind and
   of unquestionable piety. He had for several years devoted himself to
   the cause of God in connection with Mr. Wesley.

   These were the men who consecrated first Messrs. Whatcoat and Vasey to
   the office of presbyters, and then these latter assisted in the
   ordination of Dr. Coke to the office of a superintendent over the
   American Methodists.

   Let us now look for a moment at the character of Mr. Asbury, and see if
   he was not fully qualified for the high and holy trust confided to him.
   We have already seen in the preceding chapters the circumstances under
   which he was moved to come to this country as a missionary of the
   cross, the motives by which he was actuated, as well as the manner in
   which he discharged his duties up to the time in which he took upon
   himself the office of a superintendent. By these things it will be
   seen, I think, that he was "not a novice" in the things of God, in
   intellectual endowments, in moral courage, nor yet in that expansive
   benevolence which should characterize a primitive evangelist or bishop.
   He had, indeed, given such "full proof of his ministry," both as
   respects his spiritual and mental qualifications, and his indefatigable
   labors "in word and doctrine," as to insure his election to that high
   office by a unanimous vote of his brethren -- those very brethren too,
   among whom he had labored for about fifteen years. And his subsequent
   life afforded undeniable evidence that their choice had fallen upon the
   right man.

   Now, let those who question the validity of our ordination, and the
   consequent right we have to administer the ordinances, put their finger
   upon any organization of a church since the apostolic days, by any
   number of men, and if they will find stronger marks of a divine call to
   do these things, or a more urgent necessity for them, arising out of
   the circumstances of the times, we will then review our ground, and
   hesitate to pronounce the Methodist Episcopal Church Scriptural and
   apostolical in her orders and ordinances. Its founders, under the
   protection of Almighty God, were all men of learning, of deep
   experience in the things of God, of unquestionable piety, regularly
   consecrated presbyters of the Church; and the leader in this whole,
   affair was the father of the entire family of spiritual children; and
   therefore possessed rights over them which no one else possibly could.

   To all this it may be said "that the people were not consulted." But
   their wishes were already known. They had been expressed over and of
   again; and that their voice was in exact accordance with the
   proceedings of the conference, is demonstrable from numerous
   testimonies.

   Mr. Lee says, "The Methodists were pretty generally pleased at our
   becoming a church, and heartily united together in the plan which the
   conference had adopted; and from that time religion greatly revived."

   Mr. William Watters, the oldest American Methodist preacher, says, in
   his memoirs of himself, "We became, instead of a religious society, a
   separate Church. This gave great satisfaction through all the
   societies."

   The Rev. Ezekiel Cooper, in his Memoir of Bishop Asbury, after stating
   the fact of our having become an independent Church, says, "This step
   met with general approbation both among the preachers and members.
   Perhaps we shall seldom find such unanimity of sentiment upon any
   question of such magnitude."

   Nor has a murmur been heard, except from a few disaffected individuals,
   through all our borders, on account of the measures which were adopted
   at that conference, and the consequences which have resulted fully
   sustain the opinions above expressed. What is meant by these results
   is, not merely making proselytes to the system; for this of itself is
   no evidence either for or against any cause; but the real reformation
   in heart and life of thousands and tens of thousands of immortal souls.
   If, therefore, the turning of sinners "from darkness to light, and from
   the power of Satan to God," may be pleaded in favor of any system of
   operations, then may we say God has fixed the seal of his approbation
   upon the organization of the Methodist Episcopal Church; for it has
   been instrumental of doing this in the most effectual and extensive
   manner in these United States. [12]

   It has been already stated that Mr. Wesley made an abridgment of the
   Book of Common Prayer, as used in the Church of England, and
   recommended that it should be used by the preachers and people in this
   country. This accordingly was done in some of the larger towns and
   cities; but this practice, as well as that of wearing gowns, which the
   superintendents and some of the elders did for a season, was soon laid
   aside, on account of the opposition which was generally manifested
   against it, with the exception of the ordinations and sacramental
   services, which are retained and used at the present time. The
   following articles of religion were adopted at this conference, and
   published: --

  I. Of Faith in the Holy Trinity

   There is but one living and true God, everlasting, without body or
   parts, of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness: the maker and preserver
   of all things, both visible and invisible. And in unity of this Godhead
   there are three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity; -- the
   Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

  II. Of the Word, Or Son of God, who was made very Man

   The Son, who is the Word of the Father, the very and eternal God, of
   one substance with the Father, took man's nature in the womb of the
   blessed virgin; so that two whole and perfect natures, that is to say,
   the Godhead and manhood, were joined together in one person, never to
   be divided, whereof is one Christ, very God and very man, who truly
   suffered, was crucified, dead and buried, to reconcile his Father to
   us, and to be a sacrifice, not only for original guilt but also for
   actual sins of men.

  III. Of the Resurrection of Christ

   Christ did truly rise again from the dead, and took again his body,
   with all things appertaining to the perfection of man's nature,
   wherewith, he ascended into heaven, and there sitteth until he return
   to judge all men at the last day.

  IV. Of the Holy Ghost

   The Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is of one
   substance, majesty, and glory, with the Father and the Son, very and
   eternal God.

  V. Of the sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for Salvation

   Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that
   whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be
   required of any man that it should be believed as an article of faith,
   or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation. In the name of the
   Holy Scripture, we do understand those canonical books of the Old and
   New Testament of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church.

    Of the Names of the Canonical Books

   Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth,
   The First Book of Samuel, The Second Book of Samuel, The First Book of
   Kings, The Second Book of Kings, The First Book of Chronicles, The
   Second Book of Chronicles, The Book of Ezra, The Book of Nehemiah, The
   Book of Esther, The Book of Job, The Psalms, The Proverbs,
   Ecclesiastes, or the Preacher, Cantica, or Songs of Solomon, Four
   Prophets the greater, Twelve Prophets the less:

   All the books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received, we
   do receive and account canonical.

  VI. Of the Old Testament

   The Old Testament is not contrary to the New; for both in the Old and
   New Testament everlasting life is offered to mankind by Christ, who is
   the only mediator between God and man, being both God and man.
   Wherefore they are not to be heard who feign that the old fathers did
   look only for transitory promises. Although the law given from God by
   Moses, as touching ceremonies and rites, doth not bind Christians, nor
   ought the civil precepts thereof of necessity be received in any
   commonwealth; yet, notwithstanding, no Christian whatsoever is free
   from the obedience of the commandments which are called moral.

  VII. Of Original or Birth-Sin

   Original sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians
   do vainly talk,) but it is the corruption of the nature of every man,
   that naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam, whereby man is
   very far gone from original righteousness, and of his own nature
   inclined to evil, and that continually.

  VIII. Of Free Will

   The condition of man after the fall of Adam is such that he cannot turn
   and prepare himself, by his own natural strength and works, to faith,
   and calling upon God; wherefore we have no power to do good works,
   pleasant and acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Christ
   preventing us, that we may have a good will, and working with us when
   we have that good will.

  X. Of the Justification of Man

   We are accounted righteous before God only for the merit of our Lord
   and Saviour, Jesus Christ, by faith, and not for our own works or
   deservings: -- Wherefore, that we are justified by faith only is a most
   wholesome doctrine, and very full of comfort.

  X. Of Good Works

   Although good works, which are the fruits of faith, and follow after
   justification, cannot put away our sins, and endure the severity of
   God's judgment; yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ,
   and spring out of a true and lively faith, insomuch that by them a
   lively faith may be as evidently known as a tree discerned by its
   fruit.

  XI. Of Works of Supererogation

   Voluntary works, besides over and above God's commandments, which they
   call works of supererogation, cannot be taught without arrogancy and
   impiety. For by them men do declare that they do not only render unto
   God as much as they are bound to do, but that they do more for his sake
   than of bounden duty is required: whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye
   have done all that is commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants.

  XII. Of Sin after Justification

   Not every sin willingly committed after justification is the sin
   against the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore, the grant of
   repentance is not to be denied to such as fall into sin after
   justification: after we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart
   from grace given, and fall into sin, and, by the grace of God, rise
   again and amend, our lives. And therefore they are to be condemned who
   say they can no more sin as long as they live here, or deny the place
   of forgiveness to such as truly repent.

  XIII. Of the Church

   The visible church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in
   which the pure word of God is preached, and the sacraments duly
   administered according to Christ's ordinance, in all those things that
   of necessity are requisite to the same.

  XIV. Of Purgatory

   The Romish doctrine concerning purgatory, pardon, worshipping and
   adoration, as well of images as of relics, and also invocation of
   saints is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warrant
   of Scripture, but repugnant to the word of God.

  XV. Of speaking in the Congregation in such a Tongue as the People understand

   It is a thing plainly repugnant to the word of God, and the custom of
   the primitive church, to have public prayer in the church, or to
   minister the sacraments, in a tongue not understood by the people.

  XVI. Of the Sacraments

   Sacraments ordained of Christ are not only badges or tokens of
   Christian men's profession; but rather they are certain signs of grace
   and God's good will toward us, by the which he doth work invisibly in
   us, and doth not only quicken, but also strengthen and confirm our
   faith in him.

   These are two sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the gospel;
   that is to say, baptism and the supper of the Lord.

   Those five commonly called sacraments that is to say, confirmation,
   penance, orders, matrimony, and extreme unction, are not to be counted
   for sacraments of the gospel, being such as have partly grown out of
   the corrupt following of the apostles, and partly are states of life
   allowed in the Scriptures, but yet have not the like nature of baptism
   and the Lord's supper, because they have not any visible sign or
   ceremony ordained of God.

   The sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon, or to be
   carried about; but that we should duly use them. And in such only as
   worthily receive the same they have a wholesome effect or operation:
   but they that receive them unworthily purchase to themselves
   condemnation, as St. Paul saith.

  XVII. Of Baptism

   Baptism is not only a sign of profession, and mark of difference,
   whereby Christians are distinguished from others that are not baptized,
   but it is also a sign of regeneration, or the new birth. The baptism of
   young children is to be retained in the church.

  XVIII. Of the Lord's Supper

   The supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that Christians
   ought to have among themselves one to another, but rather is a
   sacrament of our redemption by Christ's death; insomuch that, to such
   as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the bread which
   we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise the cup of
   blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.

   Transubstantiation, or the change of the substance of bread and wine in
   the supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by holy writ, but is repugnant
   to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a
   sacrament, and hath given occasion to many superstitions.

   The body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten, in the supper, only
   after a heavenly and spiritual manner. And the mean whereby the body of
   Christ is received and eaten in the supper, is faith.

   The sacrament of the Lord's supper was not by Christ's' ordinance
   reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshipped.

  XIX. Of Both Kinds

   The cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the lay people: for both the
   parts of the Lord's supper, by Christ's ordinance and commandment,
   ought to be ministered to all Christians alike.

  XX. Of the one Oblation of Christ, finished upon the Cross

   The offering of Christ once made, is that perfect redemption,
   propitiation and satisfaction for all the sins of the whole world, both
   original and actual; and there is none other satisfaction for sin but
   that alone. Wherefore, the sacrifice of masses, in the which it is
   commonly said that the priest doth offer Christ for the quick and the
   dead, to have remission of pain or guilt, is a blasphemous fable, and
   dangerous deceit.

  XXI. Of the Marriage of Ministers

   The ministers of Christ are not commanded by God's law either to vow
   the estate of single life, or to abstain from marriage: therefore it is
   lawful for them, as for all other Christians, to marry at their own
   discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve best to godliness.

  XXII. Of the Rites and Ceremonies of Churches

   It is not necessary that rites and ceremonies should in all places be
   the same, or exactly alike: for they have been always different, and
   may be changed according to the diversity of countries, times, and
   men's manners, so that nothing be ordained against God's word.
   Whosoever, through his private judgment, willingly and purposely doth
   openly break the rites and ceremonies of the church to which he
   belongs, which are not repugnant to the word of God, and are ordained
   and approved by common authority, ought to be rebuked openly, that
   others may fear to do the like, as one that offendeth against the
   common order of the church, and woundeth the consciences of weak
   brethren.

   Every particular church may ordain, change, or abolish rites and
   ceremonies, so that all things may be done to edification.

  XXIII. Of the Rulers of the United States of America

   The congress, the general assemblies, the governors, and councils of
   state, as the delegates of the people, are the rulers of the United
   States of America, according to the division of power made to them by
   the general act of confederation, and by the constitutions of their
   respective states. And the said states ought not to be subject to any
   foreign jurisdiction.

  XXIV. Of Christian Men's Goods

   The riches and goods of Christians are not common, as touching the
   right, title, and possession of the same, as some do falsely boast.
   Notwithstanding, every man ought, of such things as he possesseth,
   liberally to give alms to the poor, according to his ability.

  XXV. Of a Christian Man's Oath

   As we confess that vain and rash swearing is forbidden Christian men by
   our Lord Jesus Christ, and James his apostle, so we judge that the
   Christian religion doth not prohibit but that a man may swear when the
   magistrate requireth, in a cause of faith and charity, so it be done
   according to the prophet's teaching, in justice, judgment, and truth.

   That the reader may have an entire view of the doings of this
   conference, I think it expedient to give him the rules as they were
   then adopted, noticing, as we proceed in our history, such alterations
   or new rules as have been incorporated into the Discipline from time to
   time. After giving a short account of the rise of Methodism in Europe
   and America in Section I., they proceeded, in Section II., to state

   The Method of holding a Conference, and the Business to be done
   therein.

   It is desired that all things be considered as in the immediate
   presence of God. That every person speak freely whatever is in his
   heart.

   Question 1. How may we best improve our time at the conference?

   Answer
    1. While we are conversing, let us have an especial care to set God
       always before us.
    2. In the intermediate hours, let us redeem all the time we can for
       private exercises.
    3. Therein let us give ourselves to prayer for one another, and for a
       blessing on our labor.

   Question 2. What is the method wherein we usually proceed in a
   conference?

   Answer We inquire --
    1. What preachers are admitted?
    2. Who remain on trial?

   Question 3. Is there any other business to be done in the conference?

   Answer The electing and ordaining of bishops, elders, and deacons.

   After assigning some reasons for the organization which had just been
   accomplished, and the manner in which it had been done, the fourth
   section concludes thus on the manner of constituting a bishop, and of
   his duties and responsibilities: --

   Question 2. How is a bishop to be constituted in future?

   Answer By the election of a majority of the conference, and the laying
   on of the hands of a bishop.

   Question 3. What is his duty?

   Answer To preside as moderator in our conferences; to fix the
   appointments of the preachers for the several circuits; and in the
   intervals of the conference, to change, receive, or suspend preachers,
   as necessity may require to travel through as many circuits as he can,
   and to direct in the spiritual business of the societies; as also to
   ordain bishops, elders, and deacons.

   N.[athan B[angs]. The bishop has obtained liberty, by the suffrage of
   the conference, to ordain local preachers to the office of deacons,
   provided they obtain a testimonial from the society to which they
   belong, and from the stewards of the circuit, signed by three traveling
   preachers, three deacons, and three elders, (one of them being a
   presiding elder;) the names of those nominated being read in the
   conference previous to their ordination.

   Question 4. To whom is the bishop amenable for his conduct?

   Answer To the conference, who have power to expel him for improper
   conduct, if they see it necessary.

   Question 5. If the bishop ceases from traveling at large among the
   people, shall he still exercise his office among us in any degree?

   conference, he shall not hereafter exercise any ministerial function
   whatsoever in our church.

  SECTION VII.

   On the Method of receiving Preachers, and their Duty.

   Question 1. How is a preacher to be received?

   Answer
    1. By the conference.
    2. In the interval of the conference, by the bishop, or an elder,
       until the sitting of the conference.
    3. When his name is not printed in the minutes, he must receive a
       written license from his elder or bishop.

   Question 2. What is the duty of a preacher?

   Answer
    1. To preach.
    2. To meet the societies or classes and bands.
    3. To visit the sick.
    4. To meet the leaders.
    5. To preach in the morning, where he can get hearers.

   N. B. We are fully determined never to drop morning preaching; and to
   preach at five o'clock in the summer, and at six in the winter,
   wherever it is practicable.

   Question 3. Are the preachers to read our liturgy?

   Answer All that have received a written direction for that purpose,
   under the hand of a bishop or elder, may read the liturgy as often as
   they think it expedient.

   Question 4. What are the directions given to a preacher?

   Answer
    1. Be diligent. Never be unemployed; never be triflingly employed.
       Never trifle away time; neither spend any more time at any place
       than is strictly necessary.
    2. Be serious. Let your motto be, holiness to the Lord. Avoid all
       lightness, jesting, and foolish talking.
    3. Converse sparingly and cautiously with women, 1 Timothy v, 2.
    4. Take no step toward marriage without first consulting with your
       brethren.
    5. Believe evil of no one; unless ye see it done, take heed how you
       credit it. Put the best construction on every thing. You know the
       judge is always supposed to be on the prisoner's side.
    6. Speak evil of no one: else your word especially would eat as doth a
       canker. Keep your thoughts within your own breast, till you come to
       the person concerned.
    7. Tell every one under your care what you think wrong in his conduct
       and temper, and that plainly as soon as may be: else it will fester
       in your heart. Make all haste to cast the fire cut of your bosom.
    8. Do not affect the gentleman. A preacher of the gospel is the
       servant of all.
    9. Be ashamed of nothing but sin.
   10. Be punctual. Do every thing exactly at the time. And do not mend
       our rules, but keep them; not for wrath, but conscience' sake; not
       for fear of punishment, but for conscience' sake.
   11. You have nothing to do but to save souls. Therefore spend and be
       spent in this work. And go always not only to those that want, but
       to those that want you most.
   12. Observe. it is not your business to preach so many times, and to
       take care of this or that society only: but to save as many souls
       as you can; to bring as many sinners as you possibly can to
       repentance, and with all your power to build them up in that
       holiness, without which they cannot see the Lord. And remember! a
       Methodist preacher is to mind every point, great and small, in the
       Methodist discipline! Therefore you will need to exercise all the
       sense and grace you have.
   13. Act in all things, not according to your own will, but as a son in
       the gospel. As such, it is your duty to employ your time in the
       manner which we direct: in preaching and visiting from house to
       house: in reading, meditation, and prayer. Above all, if you labor
       with us in the Lord's vineyard, it is needful you should do that
       part of the work which we advise, at those times and places which
       we judge most for his glory.

   Question 5. What method do we use in receiving a preacher at the
   conference?

   Answer After solemn fasting and prayer, every person proposed shall
   then be asked, before the conference, the following directions, (with
   any others which may be thought necessary,) viz. Have you faith in
   Christ? Are you going on to perfection? Do you expect to be made
   perfect in love in this life? Are you groaning after it? Are you
   resolved to devote yourself wholly to God and his work? Do you know the
   rules of the society? Of the bands? Do you keep them? Do you constantly
   attend the sacrament? Have you read the form of discipline? Are you
   willing to conform to it? Have you considered the rules of a preacher;
   especially the first, tenth, and twelfth? Will you keep them for
   conscience' sake? Are you determined to employ all your time in the
   work of God? Will you endeavor not to speak too long or too loud? Will
   you diligently instruct the children in every place? Will you visit
   from house to house? Will you recommend fasting or abstinence, both by
   precept and example? Are you in debt?

   We may then, if he gives satisfaction, receive him as a probationer, by
   giving him the form of discipline, inscribed thus: To A. B. "You think
   it your duty to call sinners to repentance. Make full proof hereof and
   we shall rejoice to receive you as a fellow-laborer." Let him, then,
   carefully read and weigh what is contained therein; that if he has any
   doubt, it may be removed. Observe! Taking on trial is entirely
   different from admitting a preacher. One on trial, may be either
   admitted or rejected, without doing him any wrong; otherwise it would
   be no trial at all. Let every deacon and elder explain this to those
   who are on trial, as well as to those who are in future to be proposed
   for trial.

   After two years' probation, being recommended by the elders and deacons
   present, and examined by the bishop, he may be received into full
   connection, by giving him the form of discipline, inscribed thus: "As
   long as you freely consent to, and earnestly endeavor to walk by these,
   rules, we shall rejoice to acknowledge you as a fellow laborer."

   N. B. Let none who are local, preach or exhort in any of our societies
   without a note of permission from, the deacon: let every local preacher
   or exhorter take care to have this renewed yearly: and let every elder
   insist upon it.

  SECTION VIII.

   Of the Collections that are to be made, and how the Money is to be
   expended

   Question 1. How many collections are to be made in a year?

   Answer
    1. A quarterly collection from the members of the Society to supply
       the preachers; and when that is deficient, a public quarterly
       collection. If there be any overplus, let one-third of it be
       reserved for future deficiencies; one-third be given to the poor in
       general; and one-third applied to the building or improving of our
       churches. If there is money left in the hands of the stewards at
       the close of the year, let it be sent to the conference.
    2. A yearly collection from all our members that are of ability, for
       the building of convenient churches.
    3. A collection at love-feasts, and on sacramental occasions, for the
       poor of our own society.
    4. An annual collection or subscription for the college.
    5. An annual public collection for the contingencies of the
       conference; which shall be applied,
         1. To discharge the deficiencies of those preachers who shall not
            have received their full salary in their circuits; and,
         2. To defray the expenses of our missions to distant parts of the
            continent.

   Question 2. What is the regular annual salary of the bishops, elders,
   deacons, and preachers?

   Answer Twenty-four pounds Pennsylvania currency, and their traveling
   expenses.

   Question 3. What shall be annually allowed the wives of the married
   preachers?

   Answer Twenty-four pounds Pennsylvania currency, if they are in want of
   it.

   N. B. That no ministers or preachers, traveling or local, shall receive
   any support either in money or other provision for their services,
   without the knowledge of the stewards of the circuits, and its being
   properly entered quarterly on the books.

  SECTION IX.

    On Class-Meeting

   Question 1. How may the leaders of classes be rendered more useful?

   Answer
    1. Let each of them be diligently examined concerning his method of
       meeting a class. Let this be done with all possible exactness, at
       least once a quarter. In order to this, take sufficient time.
    2. Let each leader carefully inquire how every soul in his class
       prospers: not only how each person observes the outward rules, but
       how he grows in the knowledge and love of God.
    3. Let the leaders converse with the elder and deacon frequently and
       freely.

   Question 2. Can any thing more be done in order to make the
   class-meetings lively and profitable?

   Answer
    1. Change improper leaders.
    2. Let the leaders frequently meet each other's classes.
    3. Let us observe which leaders are the most useful: and let these
       meet the other classes as often as possible.
    4. See that all the leaders be not only men of sound judgment, but men
       truly devoted to God.

   Question 3. How shall we prevent improper persons from insinuating
   themselves into the society?

   Answer
    1. Give tickets to none until they are recommended by a leader with
       whom they have met at least six months on trial.
    2. Give notes to none but those who are recommended by one you know,
       or until they have met three or four times in a class.
    3. Read the rules to them the first time they meet.

   Question 4. How shall we be more strict in receiving and excluding
   members?

   Answer In large societies we may read the names of those that are
   received and excluded once a quarter.

   Question 5. What shall we do with those members of society who
   willfully and repeatedly neglect to meet their class?

   Answer
    1. Let the elder, deacon, or one of the preachers visit them, whenever
       it is practicable, and explain to them the consequence if they
       continue to neglect, viz. exclusion.
    2. If they do not amend, let the deacon exclude them in the society;
       showing that they are laid aside for a breach of our rules of
       discipline; and not for immoral conduct.

  SECTION X.

    On the Duty of Preachers to God, themselves, and one another

   Question 1. How shall a preacher be qualified for his charge?

   Answer By walking closely with God, and having his work greatly at
   heart: and by understanding and loving discipline, ours in particular.

   Question 2. Do we sufficiently watch over each other?

   Answer We do not. Should we not frequently ask each other, Do you walk
   closely with God? Have you now fellowship with the Father and the Son?
   At what hour do you rise? Do you punctually observe the morning and
   evening hour of retirement, viz. five o'clock? Do you spend the day in
   the manner which the conference advises? Do you converse seriously,
   usefully, and closely? To be more particular: Do you use all the means
   of grace yourself, and enforce the use of them on all other persons?
   They are either instituted or prudential.

   I. The instituted are,
    1. Prayer; private, family, public; consisting of deprecation,
       petition, intercession, and thanksgiving. Do you use each of these?
       Do you forecast daily wherever you are, to secure time for private
       devotion? Do you practice it everywhere? Do you ask everywhere,
       Have you family prayer? Do you ask individuals; Do you use private
       prayer every morning and evening in particular?
    2. Searching the Scriptures, by
         1. Reading; constantly, some part of every day, regularly, all
            the Bible in order: carefully, with Mr. Wesley's notes:
            seriously, with prayer before and after: fruitfully,
            immediately practicing what you learn there?
         2. Meditating: at set times? By rule?
         3. Hearing: every opportunity? with prayer before, and after?
            Have you a Bible always about you?
    3. The Lord's supper: Do you use this at every opportunity? With
       solemn prayer before? With earnest and deliberate self-devotion?
    4. Fasting: Do you use as much abstinence and fasting every week, as
       your health, strength, and labor will permit?
    5. Christian conference: Are you convinced how important and how
       difficult it is to order your conversation aright? Is it always in
       grace, seasoned with salt; meet to minister grace to the hearers?
       Do you not converse too long at a time? Is not an hour commonly
       enough? Would it not be well always to have a determinate end in
       view, and to pray before and after it?

   II. Prudential means we may use, either as Christians, as Methodists,
   as preachers, or as ministers.

   6. As Christians: What particular rules have you is order to grow in
   grace? What arts of holy living?

   7. As Methodists: Do you never miss your class or band?

   8. As preachers: Do you meet every society? also, the leaders and
   bands?

   9. As ministers: Have you thoroughly considered your duty? And do you
   make a conscience of executing every part of it?

   These means may be used without fruit. But there are some means which
   cannot; namely, watching, denying ourselves, taking up our cross,
   exercise of the presence of God.
    1. Do you steadily watch against the world? yourself? your besetting
       sin?
    2. Do you deny yourself every useless pleasure of sense? imagination?
       honor? Are you temperate in all things? instance in food.
         1. Do you use only that kind, and that degree which is best both
            for your body and soul? Do you see the necessity of this?
         2. Do you eat no flesh suppers?
         3. Do you eat no more at each meal than is necessary? Are you not
            heavy or drowsy after dinner?
         4. Do you use only that kind and that degree of drink which is
            best both for your body and soul?
         5. Do you choose and use water for your common drink? and only
            take wine medicinally or sacramentally?
    3. Wherein do you take up your cross daily? Do you cheerfully bear
       your cross (whatever is grievous to nature) as a gift of God, and
       labor to profit thereby?
    4. Do you endeavor to set God always before you? to see his eye
       continually fixed upon you? Never can you use these means but a
       blessing will ensue; and the more you use them, the more will you
       grow in grace.

  SECTION XI.

    On the Necessity of Union among ourselves

   Let us be deeply sensible (from what we have known) of the evil of a
   division in principle, spirit, or practice, and the dreadful
   consequences to ourselves and others. If we are united, what can stand
   before us? if we divide, we shall destroy ourselves, the work of God,
   and the souls of our people.

   Question 1. What can be done in order to a closer union with each
   other?

   Answer
    1. Let us be deeply convinced of the absolute necessity of it.
    2. Pray earnestly for, and speak freely to each other.
    3. When we meet, let us never part without prayer.
    4. Take great care not to despise each other's gifts.
    5. Never speak lightly of each other.
    6. Let us defend each other's character in every thing, so far as is
       consistent with truth.
    7. Labor in honor each to prefer the other before himself.

  SECTION XII.

    Of the Trial of those who think they are moved by the Holy Ghost to Preach

   Question 1. How shall we try those who profess to be moved by the Holy
   Ghost to preach?

   Answer
    1. Let them be asked the following questions, viz. Do they know God as
       a pardoning God? Have they the love of God abiding in them? Do they
       desire and seek nothing but God? And are they holy in all manner of
       conversation?
    2. Have they gifts (as well as grace) for the work? Have they (in some
       tolerable degree) a clear, sound understanding, a right judgment in
       the things of God, a just conception of salvation by faith? And has
       God given them any degree of utterance? Do they speak justly,
       readily, clearly?
    3. Have they fruit? Are any truly convinced of sin, and converted to
       God by their preaching?

   As long as these three marks concur in any one, we believe he is called
   of God to preach. These we receive as sufficient proof that he is moved
   by the holy Ghost.

  SECTION XIII.

    Of the Spirit and Truth of Singing

   Question 1. How shall we guard against formality in singing?

   Answer
    1. By choosing such hymns as are proper for the congregation.
    2. By not singing too much at once; seldom more than five or six
       verses.
    3. By suiting the time to the words.
    4. By often stopping short, and asking the people, "Now!, do you know
       what you said last? Did you speak no more than you felt?"
    5. Do not suffer the people to sing too slow. This naturally tends to
       formality, and is brought in by those who have either very strong
       or very weak voices.
    6. In every large society let them learn to sing; and let them always
       learn our tunes first.
    7. Let the women constantly sing their parts alone. Let no man sing
       with them, unless he understands the notes and sings the bass as it
       is composed in the tunebook.
    8. Introduce no new tune till they are perfect in the old.
    9. Recommend our tune-book; and if you cannot sing yourself, choose a
       person or two at each place to pitch the tune for you.
   10. Exhort every person in the congregation to sing, not one in ten
       only.
   11. Sing no hymns of your own composing.
   12. If a preacher be present, let him alone give out the words.
   13. When the singers would teach a tune to the congregation, they must
       sing only the tenor.

  SECTION XIV.

    Rules by which we should Continue Or Desist from Preaching at any Place

   Question 1. Is it advisable for us to preach in as many places as we
   can, without forming any societies?

   Answer By no means: we have made the trial in various places; and that
   for a considerable time. But all the seed has fallen by the way-side.
   There is scarce any fruit remaining.

   Question 2. Where should we endeavor to preach most?

   Answer
    1. Where there are the greatest number of quiet and willing hearers.
    2. Where there is the most fruit.

   Question 3. Ought we not diligently to observe in what places God is
   pleased at any time to pour out his Spirit more abundantly?

   Answer We ought; and at that time to send more laborers than usual into
   that part of the harvest.

  SECTION XV.

    On the Matter and Manner of Preaching, and other public exercises.

   Question 1. What is the best general method of preaching?

   Answer
    1. To convince:
    2. To offer Christ:
    3. To invite:
    4. To build up: and to do this in some measure in every sermon.

   Question 2. Are there any smaller advices relative to preaching which
   might be of use to us?

   Answer Perhaps these:
    1. Be sure never to disappoint a congregation.
    2. Begin precisely at the time appointed.
    3. Let your whole deportment be serious, weighty, and solemn.
    4. Always suit your subject to your audience.
    5. Choose the plainest text you can.
    6. Take care not to ramble, but keep to your text, and make out what
       you take in hand.
    7. Take care of any thing awkward or affected, either in your gesture,
       phrase, or pronunciation.
    8. Print nothing without the approbation of the conference, and one of
       the bishops.
    9. Do not usually pray extempore above eight or ten minutes (at most)
       without intermission
   10. Frequently read and enlarge upon a portion of Scripture; and let
       young preachers often exhort without taking a text.
   11. Always avail yourself of the great festivals by preaching on the
       occasion.

   Question 3. Have not some of us been led off from practical preaching,
   by what is called preaching Christ?

   Answer The most effectual way of preaching Christ, is to preach him in
   all his offices; and to declare his law, as well as his gospel, both to
   believers and unbelievers. Let us strongly and closely insist upon
   inward and outward holiness in all its branches.

  SECTION XVI.

    Against Antinomianism

   Question 1. What can be done to guard against Antinomianism?

   Answer
    1. Let all the preachers carefully read over Mr. Wesley's and Mr.
       Fletcher's tracts.
    2. Let them frequently and explicitly preach the truth, but not in a
       controversial way. And let them take care to do it in love and
       gentleness: not in bitterness, returning railing for railing.
    3. Answer all the objections of our people as occasion offers: but
       take care to do it in a Christian temper.

   Question 2. Wherein lies our danger of it?

   Answer
    1. With regard to man's faithfulness, our Lord himself hath taught us
       to use the expression; therefore we ought never to be ashamed of
       it. We ought steadily to assert, upon his authority, that if a man
       is not faithful in the unrighteous mammon, God will not give him
       the true riches.
    2. With regard to working for life, which our Lord expressly commands
       us to do. Labor (ergadzesthe) literally, work for the meat that
       endureth to everlasting life. And in fact every believer, till he
       comes to glory, works for as well as from life.
    3. We have received it as a maxim, that "a man is to do nothing in
       order to justification." Nothing can be more false. Whoever desires
       to find favor with God should cease from evil, and learn to do
       well. So God himself teacheth by the Prophet Isaiah. Whoever
       repents, should do works meet for repentance: and if this is not in
       order to find favor, what does he do them for?

   Once more review the whole affair.

   1. Who of us is now accepted of God?

   He that now believes in Christ, with a loving, obedient heart.

   2. But who among those that never heard of Christ?

   He that, according to the light he has, feareth God, and worketh
   righteousness.

   3. Is this the same with, He that is sincere?

   Nearly, if not quite.

   4. Is not this salvation by works?

   Not by the merit of works, but by works as a condition.

   5. The grand objection to one of the preceding propositions is drawn
   from matter of fact. God does in fact justify those who by their own
   confession neither fear God, nor wrought righteousness. Is this an
   exception to the general rule?

   It is a doubt whether God makes any exception at all. But how are we
   sure that the person in question never did fear God and work
   righteousness?

   His own thinking so is no proof; for we know how all that are convinced
   of sin undervalue themselves in every respect.

   Does not talking without proper caution of a justified or sanctified
   state tend to mislead men? almost naturally leading them to trust in
   what was done in one moment? whereas we are every moment pleasing or
   displeasing God, according to our works; according to the whole of our
   present inward tempers and outward behavior.

  SECTION XVII.

    How to provide for the Circuits in the time of Conference, and to preserve
    and increase the Work of God.

   Question What can be done to supply the circuits during the sitting of
   the conference?

   Answer
    1. Let all the appointments stand according to the plan of the circuit
       it.
    2. Engage as many local preachers and exhorters as will supply them;
       and let them be paid for their time in proportion to the salary of
       the traveling preachers.
    3. If preachers and exhorters cannot attend, let some person of
       ability be appointed in every society to sing, pray, and read one
       of Mr. Wesley's sermons.
    4. And if that cannot be done, let there be prayer meetings.
    5. Wherever you can, in large societies, appoint prayer meetings.

   Lastly, let a fast be published at every quarterly meeting for the
   Friday following; and a memorandum of it be written on all the class
   papers. Also be active in dispersing the books among the people.

  SECTION XVIII.

    Of employing our Time profitably when we are not traveling, or engaged in
    public exercises.

   Question 1. What general method of employing our time would you advise
   us to?

   Answer We advise you,
    1. As often as possible to rise at four.
    2. From four to five in the morning, and from five to six in the
       evening, to meditate, pray, and read the Scriptures, with Mr.
       Wesley's Notes, and the closely practical parts of what he has
       published.
    3. From six in the morning till twelve (allowing an hour for
       breakfast) read in order, with much prayer, the Christian library
       and other pious books.

   Question 2. Why is it that the people under our care are not better?

   Answer Other reasons may concur; but the chief is, because we are not
   more knowing and more holy.

   Question 3. But why are we not more knowing?

   Answer Because we are idle. We forget our first rule, "Be diligent.
   Never be unemployed. Never be triflingly employed; neither spend any
   more time at any place than is strictly necessary." I fear there is
   altogether a fault in this matter, and that few of us are clear. Which
   of you spends as many hours a day in God's work as you did formerly in
   man's work? We talk, talk -- or read what comes next to hand. We must,
   absolutely must cure this evil, or betray the cause of God. But how?
    1. Read the most useful books, and that regularly and constantly
    2. Steadily spend all the morning in this employment at least five
       hours in four and twenty. "But I have no taste for reading."
       Contract a taste for it by use, or return to your former
       employment. "But I have no books." Be diligent to spread the books,
       and you will have the use them.

  SECTION XIX.

    On Baptism

   Let every adult person, and the parents of every child to be baptized,
   have the choice either of immersion, sprinkling, or pouring.

   N. B. We will on no account whatever receive a present for
   administering baptism, or the burial of the deed.

  SECTION XX.

    On the Lord's Supper

   Question Are there any directions to be given concerning the
   administration of the Lord's supper?

   Answer
    1. Let those who choose receive it kneeling, and those who do not,
       either standing or sitting.
    2. Let no person that is not a member of our society be admitted to
       the communion, without examination, and some token given by an
       elder or deacon.

  SECTION XXI.

    On unlawful Marriages

   Question 1. Do we observe any evil which has lately prevailed among our
   societies?

   Answer Many of our members have married with unawakened persons. This
   has produced bad effects; they have been either hindered for life, or
   turned back to perdition.

   Question 2. What can be done to put a stop to this?

   Answer
    1. Let every preacher publicly enforce the apostle's caution, "Be ye
       not unequally yoked together with unbelievers."
    2. Let him openly declare whoever does this will be expelled the
       society.
    3. When any such is expelled, let a suitable exhortation be subjoined
    4. Let all be exhorted to take no step in so weighty a matter, without
       advising with the most serious of their brethren.

   Question 3. Ought any woman to marry without the consent of her
   parents?

   Answer In general, she ought not. Yet there may be exceptions. For if;
    1. A woman be under the necessity of marrying. If;
    2. Her parents absolutely refuse to let her marry any Christian; then
       she may, nay, ought to marry without their consent. Yet even then a
       Methodist preacher ought not to be married to her.

  SECTION XXII.

    On Perfection

   Let us strongly and explicitly exhort all believers to go on to
   perfection. That we may all speak the same thing, we ask once for all,
   Shall we defend this perfection, or give it up? We all agree to defend
   it, meaning thereby (as we did from the beginning) salvation from all
   sin, by the love of God and man filling our heart. The Papists say,
   "This cannot be attained till we have been refined by the fire of
   purgatory." Some professors say, "Nay, it will be attained as soon as
   the soul and body part." Others say, "It may be attained before we die:
   a moment after is too late." Is it so or not? we are; all agreed we may
   be saved from all sin, properly so called, before death, i.e., sinful
   tempers; but we cannot always speak or think or act, aright, as
   dwelling in houses of clay. The substance then is settled; but as to
   the circumstances, is the change gradual or instantaneous? It is both
   the one and the other. "But should we in preaching insist both on one
   and the other?" Certainly we should insist on the gradual change; and
   that earnestly and continually. And are there not reasons why we should
   insist on the instantaneous change? If there be such a blessed change
   before death, should we not encourage all believers to expect it? and
   the rather, because constant experience shows the more earnestly they
   expect this, the more swiftly and steadily does the gradual work of God
   go on in their souls; the more careful are they to grow in grace; the
   more zealous of good works, and the more punctual in their attendance
   on all the ordinances of God; (whereas just the contrary effects are
   observed whenever this expectation ceases.) They are saved by hope, by
   this hope of a total change, with a gradually increasing salvation.
   Destroy this hope, and that salvation stands still, or rather decreases
   daily. Therefore whoever will advance the gradual change in believers,
   should strongly insist on the instantaneous.

  SECTION XXIII.

    On Dress

   Question Should we insist on the rules concerning dress?

   Answer By all me Answer This is no time to give any encouragement to
   superfluity of apparel; therefore give no tickets to any till they have
   left off superfluous ornaments. In order to this,
    1. Let every deacon read the thoughts upon dress, at least once a
       year, in every large society.
    2. In visiting the classes be very mild, but very strict.
    3. Allow of no exempt case, not even of a married woman: better one
       suffer than many.
    4. Give no tickets to any that wear high heads, enormous bonnets,
       ruffles, or rings.

  SECTION XXIV.

    On the Privileges granted to serious Persons that are not of the Society

   Question 1. How often shall we permit strangers to be present at the
   meeting of the society?

   Answer At every other meeting of the society in every place, let no
   stranger be admitted. At other times they may; but the same persons not
   above twice or thrice.

   Question 2. How often shall we permit strangers to be present at our
   love-feasts?

   Answer Let them be admitted with the utmost caution; and the same
   person on no account above twice or thrice, unless he become a member.

  SECTION XXV.

    On visiting from house to house; guarding against those Sins that are so
    common to Professors, and enforcing practical Religion

   Question 1. How can we farther assist those under our care?

   Answer By instructing them at their own houses. What unspeakable need
   is there of this? The world says, "The Methodists are no better than
   other people." This is not true in the general. But,
    1. Personal religion, either toward God or man, is too superficial
       among us. We can but just touch on a few particulars. How little
       faith is there among us! how little communion with God! how little
       living in heaven, walking in eternity, deadness to every creature!
       how much love of the world! desire of pleasure, of ease, of getting
       money! how little brotherly love! what continual judging one
       another! what gossiping, evil speaking, tale-bearing! what want of
       moral honesty! To instance only one particular: Who does as he
       would be done by, in buying and selling?
    2. Family religion is wanting in many branches. And what avails public
       preaching alone, though we could preach like angels? We must, yea,
       every traveling preacher must instruct the people from house to
       house. Till this is done, and that in good earnest, the Methodists
       will be no better.

   Our religion is not deep, universal, uniform; but superficial, partial,
   uneven. It will be so till we spend half as much time in this visiting
   as we do now in talking uselessly. Can we find a better method of doing
   this than Mr. Baxter's? If not, let us adopt it without delay. His
   whole tract, entitled, Gildas Salvianus, is well worth a careful
   perusal. Speaking of this visiting from house to house, he says,
   (p.351,)

   "We shall find many hindrances, both in ourselves and the people.
    1. In ourselves, there is much dullness and laziness, so that there
       will be much ado to get us to be faithful in the work.
    2. We have a base, man-pleasing temper, so that we let men perish,
       rather than lose their love; we let them go quietly to hell, lest
       we should offend them.
    3. Some of us have also a foolish bashfulness. We know not how to
       begin, and blush to contradict the devil.
    4. But the greatest hindrance is weakness of faith. Our whole motion
       is weak, because the spring of it is weak.
    5. Lastly, we are unskillful in the work. How few know how to deal
       with men so as to get within them, and suit all our discourse to
       their several conditions and tempers to choose the fittest
       subjects, and follow them with a holy mixture of seriousness,
       terror, love, and meekness!

   But undoubtedly this private application is implied, those solemn words
   of the apostle, "I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ,
   who shall judge the quick and dead at his appearing, preach the word;
   be instant in season, out of season: reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all
   longsuffering."

   O brethren, if we could but set this work on foot in all our societies,
   and prosecute it zealously, what glory would redound to God! If the
   common lukewarmness were banished, and every shop and every house
   busied, in speaking of the word and works of God, surely God would
   dwell in our habitations, and make us his delight.

   And this is absolutely necessary to the welfare of our people, some of
   whom neither repent nor believe to this day. Look around and see how
   many of them are still in apparent danger of damnation. And how can you
   walk, and talk, and be merry with such people, when you know their
   case? Methinks when you look them in the face, you should break forth
   into tears, as the prophet did when he looked upon Hazael, and then set
   on them with the most vehement exhortations. O, for God's sake, and the
   sake of poor souls, bestir yourselves, and spare no pains that may
   conduce to their salvation!

   What cause have we to bleed before the Lord this day, that we have so
   long neglected this good work! If we had but engaged in it sooner, how
   many more might have been brought to Christ! and how much holier and
   happier might we have made our societies before now! and why might we
   not have done it sooner? There are many hindrances: and so there always
   will be; but the greatest hindrance was in ourselves, in our littleness
   of faith and love.

   But it is objected, 1. This will take up so much time, we shall not
   have leisure to follow our studies.

   We answer,
    1. Gaining knowledge is a good thing, but saving soul is a better.
    2. By this very thing you will gain the most excellent knowledge, that
       of God and eternity.
    3. You will have time for gaining other knowledge too. Only sleep not
       more than you need; "and never be idle or triflingly employed."
       But,
    4. If you can do but one, let your studies alone. We ought to throw by
       all the libraries in the world rather than be guilty of the loss of
       one soul.

   It is objected, 2. "The people will not submit to it." If some will
   not, others will; and the success with them will repay all your labor.
   O let us herein follow the example of St. Paul.
    1. For our general business, Serving the Lord with all humility of
       mind.
    2. Our special work, Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock.
    3. Our doctrine, Repentance toward God, and faith in our Lord Jesus
       Christ.
    4. The place, I have taught you publicly, and from house to house.
    5. The object and manner of teaching, I ceased not to warn every one,
       night and day, with tears
    6. His innocence and self-denial herein, I have coveted no man's
       silver or gold.
    7. His patience, Neither count I my life dear unto myself. And, among
       all other motives, let these be ever before our eyes.
         1. The church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
         2. Grievous wolves shall enter in; yea, of yourselves shall men
            arise, speaking perverse things.

   Write this upon your hearts, and it will do you more good than twenty
   years' study. Then you will have no time to spare: you will have work
   enough. Then likewise no preacher will stay with us who is as salt that
   has lost its savor; for to such this employment would be mere drudgery
   and in order to it, you will have need of all the knowledge you can
   procure, and grace you can attain.

   The sum is, Go into every house in course, and teach every one therein,
   young and old, to be Christians inwardly and outwardly; make every
   particular plain to their understandings; fix it in their minds; write
   it on their hearts. In order to this, there must be line upon line,
   precept upon precept. What patience, what love, what knowledge is
   requisite for this? we must needs do this, were it only to avoid
   idleness. Do we not loiter away many hours in every week? each try
   himself: no idleness is consistent with growth in grace. Nay, without
   exactness in redeeming time, you cannot retain the grace you received
   in justification.

   Question 2. Why are we not more holy, why do not we live in eternity?
   walk with God all the day long? Why are we not all devoted to God?
   breathing the whole spirit of missionaries?

   Answer Chiefly because we are enthusiasts; looking for the end without
   using the means. To touch only upon two or three instances: Who of you
   rises at four? or even at five, when he does not preach? Do you know
   the obligation and benefit of fasting or abstinence? How often do you
   practice it? 2. The neglect of this alone is sufficient to account for
   our feebleness and faintness of spirit. We are continually grieving the
   Holy Spirit of God by the habitual neglect of a plain duty. Let us
   amend from this hour.

   Question 3. How shall we guard against Sabbath-breaking, evil speaking,
   unprofitable conversation, lightness, expensiveness or gayety of
   apparel, and contracting debts without due care to discharge them?

   Answer
    1. Let us preach expressly on each of these heads.
    2. Read in every society the sermon on evil speaking.
    3. Let the leaders closely examine and exhort every person to put away
       the accursed thing.
    4. Let the preacher warn every society that none who is guilty herein
       can remain with us.
    5. Extirpate buying or selling goods that have not paid the duty laid
       upon them by government out every society. Let none remain with us
       who will not totally abstain from this evil in every kind and
       degree.
    6. Extirpate bribery, receiving any thing directly or indirectly for
       voting at any election. Show no respect to persons herein, but
       expel all that touch the accursed thing.

   Question 4. What shall we do to prevent scandal when any of our members
   fail in business, or contract debts which they are not able to pay?

   Answer Let the elder or deacon desire two or three judicious members of
   the society to inspect the accounts of the supposed delinquents; and if
   they have behaved dishonestly, or borrowed money without a probability
   of paying, let them be suspended until their credit is restored.

  SECTION XXVI.

    On the Instruction of Children

   Question What shall we do for the rising generation? Let him who is
   zealous for God and the souls of men begin now.

   Answer
    1. Where there are ten children whose parents are in society meet them
       an hour once a week; but where this is impracticable, meet them
       once in two weeks.
    2. Procure our instructions for them, and let all who can read and
       commit them to memory.
    3. Explain and impress them upon their hearts.
    4. Talk with them every time you see any at home.
    5. Pray in earnest for them. Diligently instruct and exhort all
       parents at their own houses.
    6. Let the elders, deacons, and preachers take a list of the names of
       the children; and if any of them be truly awakened, let them be
       admitted into society.
    7. Preach expressly on education: "But I have no gift for this." Pray
       earnestly for the gift, and use means to attain it.

  SECTION XXVII.

    On building Churches, and on the Order to be observed therein

   Question 1. Is any thing advisable in regard to building?

   Answer Let all our churches be built plain and decent; but not more
   expensively than is absolutely unavoidable: otherwise the necessity of
   raising money will make rich men necessary to us. But if so, we must be
   dependent on them, yea, and governed by them. And then farewell to the
   Methodist discipline, if not doctrine too.

   N. B.
    1. That no person shall be eligible as a trustee to any of our
       churches or colleges, nor act as a steward or leader, that is not
       in constant church-communion, and a regular leader or member of a
       class.
    2. That no person that is a trustee shall be ejected while he is in
       joint security for money, unless such relief be given him as is
       demanded, or the person who makes the loan will accept.

   Question 2. Is there any exception to the rule, "Let the men and women
   sit apart?"

   Answer There is no exception. Let them sit apart in all our churches.

   Question 3. But is there not a worse indecency than this, talking in
   the congregation before and after service? How shall this be cured?

   Answer Let all the ministers and preachers join as one man, and enlarge
   on the impropriety of talking before or after service; and strongly
   exhort those that are concerned to do it no more. In three months, if
   we are in earnest, this vile practice will be banished out of every
   Methodist congregation. Let none stop till he has carried his point.

  SECTION XXVIII.

    On raising a general Fund for the Propagation of the gospel

   Question How may we raise a general fund for carrying on the whole work
   of God?

   Answer By a yearly collection, and, if need be, a quarterly one, to be
   raised by every assistant in every principal, congregation in his
   circuit. To this end, he may then read and enlarge upon the following
   hints in every such congregation:

   How shall we send laborers into those parts where they are most of all
   wanted? Many are willing to hear, but not to bear the expense. Nor can
   it as yet be expected of them stay till the word of God has touched
   their hearts, and then they will gladly provide for them that preach
   it. Does it not lie upon us in the meantime to supply their lack of
   service? to raise a general fund, out of which from time to time that
   expense may be defrayed? By this means those who willingly offer
   themselves may travel through every part, whether there are societies
   or not, and stay wherever there is a call, without being burdensome to
   any. Thus may the gospel, in the life and power thereof, be spread from
   sea to sea. Which of you will not rejoice to throw in your mite to
   promote this glorious work?

   Besides this, in carrying on so large a work through the continent,
   there are calls for money in various ways, and we must frequently be at
   considerable expense, or the work must be at a full stop. Many, too,
   are the occasional distresses of our preachers, or their families,
   which require an immediate supply. Otherwise their hands would hang
   down, if they were not constrained to depart from the work.

   "The money contributed will be brought to the ensuing conference.

   "Men and brethren, help! Was there ever a call like this since you
   first heard the gospel sound? Help to relieve your companions in the
   kingdom of Jesus, who are pressed above measure. Bear ye one another's
   burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. Help to send forth able,
   willing laborers into your Lord's harvest so shall ye be assistant in
   saving souls from death, and hiding a multitude of sins. Help to
   propagate the gospel of your salvation to the remotest corners of the
   earth, till the knowledge of our Lord shall cover the land as the
   waters cover the sea. So shall it appear to ourselves and all men that
   we are indeed one body, united by one spirit; so shall the baptized
   heathens be yet again constrained to say, See how these Christians love
   one another.'

  SECTION XXIX.

    Of the Method of raising a Fund for the superannuated Preachers, and the
    Widows and Orphans of Preachers

   Question 1. How can we provide for superannuated preachers, and the
   widows and orphans of preachers?

   Answer
    1. Let every preacher contribute two dollars yearly at the conference.
    2. Let every one when first admitted as a traveling preacher pay
       twenty shillings Pennsylvania currency.
    3. Let the money be lodged in the hands of the presiding elder, or
       lent to the college; and an account thereof kept by the deacon.

   N. B. The application of the money shall rest with the conference.

   4.?Out of this fund let provision be made, first, for the worn-out
   preachers, and then for the widows and children of those that are dead.

   5.?Every worn-out preacher shall receive, if he wants it, not usually
   more than twenty-four pounds annually; Pennsylvania currency.

   6.?Every widow of a preacher shall receive yearly if she wants it,
   during her widowhood, twenty pounds.

   7.?Every child of a preacher shall receive once for all, if he wants
   it, twenty pounds.

   8.?But none shall be entitled to any thing from this fund till he has
   paid fifty shillings.

   9.?Nor any who neglect paying his subscription for three years
   together, unless he be sent by the conference out of these United
   States.

   10.?Let every assistant, as far as possible, bring to the conference
   the contribution of every preacher left behind in his circuit.

  SECTION XXXI.

    On the Printing of Books, and the Application of the Profits arising
    therefrom

   As it has been frequently recommended by the preachers and people that
   such books as are wanted be printed in this country, we therefore
   propose,
    1. That the advice of the conference shall be desired concerning any
       valuable impression, and their consent be obtained before any steps
       be taken for the printing thereof.
    2. That the profits of the books, after all the necessary expenses are
       defrayed, shall be applied, according to the discretion of the
       conference, toward the college, the preachers' fund, the
       deficiencies of preachers' salaries, the distant missions, or the
       debts of our churches.

  SECTION XXXII.

    On bringing to Trial, finding guilty, reproving, suspending, and excluding
    disorderly Persons from Society and Church Privileges

   Question How shall a suspected member be brought to trial?

   Answer Before the society of which he is a member, or a select number
   of them, in the presence of a bishop, elder, deacon, or preacher, in
   the following manner: --

   Let the accused and accuser be brought face to face: if this cannot be
   done, let the next best evidence be procured. If the accused person be
   found guilty and the crime be such as is expressly forbidden by the
   word of God, sufficient to exclude a person from the kingdom of grace
   and glory, and to make him a subject of wrath and hell, let him be
   expelled. If he evade a trial by absenting himself after sufficient
   notice given him, and the circumstances of the accusation be strong and
   presumptive, let him be esteemed as guilty, and accordingly excluded.
   And without evident marks and fruits of repentance, such offenders
   shall be solemnly disowned before the church. Witnesses from without
   shall not be rejected, if a majority believe them to be honest men.

   But in cases of neglect of duties of any kind, imprudent conduct,
   indulging sinful tempers or words, disobedience to the order and
   discipline of the church, -- First, let private reproof be given by a
   leader or preacher; if there be an acknowledgment of the fault and
   proper humiliation, the person may remain on trial. On a second
   offense, a preacher may take one or two faithful friends. On a third
   failure, if the transgression be increased or continued, let it be
   brought before the society, or a select number; if there be no sign of
   humiliation, and the church is dishonored, the offender must be cut
   off. If there be a murmur or complaint that justice is not done, the
   person shall be allowed an appeal to the quarterly meeting, and have
   his case reconsidered before a bishop, presiding elder, or deacon, with
   the preachers, stewards, and leaders who may be present. After such
   forms of trial and expulsion, such persons as are thus excommunicated
   shall have no privileges of society and sacrament in our church,
   without contrition, confession, and proper trial.

   N. B. From this time forward, no person shall be owned as a member of
   our church without six months' trial.

  SECTION XXXIII.

    On the Manner by which immoral ministers and Preachers shall be brought to
    Trial, found guilty, reproved, and suspended in the Intervals of Conference.

   Question 1. What shall be done when an elder, deacon, or preacher is
   under the report of being guilty of some capital crime, expressly
   forbidden in the word of God as an unchristian practice, sufficient to
   exclude a person from the kingdom of grace and glory, and to make him a
   subject of wrath and hell?

   Answer Let the presiding elder call as many ministers to, the trial as
   he shall think fit, at least three, and if possible bring the accused
   and accuser face to face; if the person is clearly convicted, he shall
   be suspended from official services in the church, and not be allowed
   the privileges of a member. But if the accused be a presiding elder,
   the preachers must call in the presiding elder of the neighboring
   district, who is required to attend, and act as judge.

   If the persons cannot be brought face to face, but the supposed
   delinquent flees from trial, it shall he received as a presumptive
   proof of guilt; and out of the mouth of two or three witnesses he shall
   be condemned. Nevertheless, he may then demand a trial face to face, or
   he may appeal to the next conference in that district.

   Question 2. What shall be done in cases of improper tempers, words, or
   actions, or a breach of the articles and discipline of the church?

   Answer The person so offending shall be reprehended by his bishop,
   elder, deacon, or preacher that has the charge of the circuit; or if he
   be a bishop he shall be reprehended by the conference. [13] Should a
   second transgression take place, one, two, or three preachers may be
   called in if not cured then, he shall be tried at the quarterly meeting
   by the elder and preachers present; if still incurable, he shall be
   brought before the conference, and if found guilty and impenitent, he
   shall be expelled from the connection, and his name so returned in the
   Minutes.

   N. B. Any preacher suspended, at a quarterly meeting, from preaching
   shall not resume that employment again but by the order of the
   conference. But it is to be observed that a preacher shall be tried by
   a deacon, a deacon by an elder, an elder by a presiding elder, and a
   presiding elder by the presiding elder of a neighboring district.

  SECTION XXXIV.

    On the Qualification and Duty of Stewards

   Question 1. What are the qualifications necessary for stewards?

   Answer Let them be men of solid piety, that both know and love the
   Methodist doctrine and discipline; and of good natural and acquired
   abilities to transact the temporal business.

   Question 2. What is the duty of stewards?

   Answer To take an exact account of all the money or other provision
   made for and received by any traveling of the preacher in the circuit;
   to make an accurate return of every expenditure of money whether to the
   preacher, the sick or the poor; to seek the needy and distressed in
   order to relieve and comfort them; to inform the preachers of any sick
   or disorderly persons; to tell the preachers what they think wrong in
   them; to attend the quarterly meetings of their circuit; to give
   advice, if asked, in planning the circuit; to attend committees for the
   application of money to churches; to give counsel in matters of
   arbitration; to provide elements for the Lord's supper; to write
   circular letters to the societies in the circuit to be more liberal, if
   need be; as also to let them know the state of the temporalities at the
   last quarterly meeting; to register the marriages and baptisms, and to
   be subject to the bishops, the presiding elder of their district, and
   the elder, deacon, and traveling preachers of their circuit.

   Question 3. What number of stewards are necessary in each circuit .

   Answer Not less than two, nor more than four.

  SECTION XXXV.

    The Nature, Design, and general Rules of the United Societies

    1. Our society is nothing more than "a company of men having the form
       and seeking the power of godliness, united in order to pray
       together, to receive the word of exhortation, and to watch over one
       another in love, that they may help each other to work out their
       salvation."
    2. That it may the more easily be discerned, whether they are indeed
       working out their own salvation, each society is divided into
       smaller companies, called classes, according to their respective
       places of abode. There are about twelve peons in every class; one
       of whom is styled the leader. It is his duty,

   I. To see each person in his class once a week at least, in order
    1. To inquire how their souls prosper;
    2. To advise, reprove, comfort, or exhort, as occasion may require;
    3. To receive what they are willing to give toward the relief of the
       preachers, church, and poor. [14]

   II. To meet the minister and the stewards of the society once a week;
   in order
    1. To inform the minister of any that are sick, or of any that walk
       disorderly, or will not be reproved.
    2. To pay to the stewards what they have received of their several
       classes in the week preceding.
    3. There is one only condition previously required of those who desire
       admission into these societies, a desire to free from the wrath to
       come, i.e., a desire to be saved from their sins: but, wherever
       this is really fixed in the soul, it will be shown by its fruits.
       It is therefore expected of all who continue therein that they
       should continue to evidence their desire of salvation.

   First, By doing no harm, by avoiding evil of every kind; especially
   that which is most generally practiced such as
     * The taking the name of God in vain;
     * The profaning the day of the Lord, either by doing ordinary work
       thereon, or by buying or selling:
     * Drunkenness, buying or selling spirituous liquors, or drinking
       them.
     * The buying or selling the bodies and souls of men, women, or
       children, with an intention to enslave them:
     * Fighting, quarreling, brawling; brother going to law with brother;
       returning evil for evil, or railing for railing, the using many
       words in buying or selling:
     * The buying or selling goods that have not paid the duty;
     * The giving or taking things on usury, i. e., unlawful interest;
     * Uncharitable or unprofitable conversation; particularly speaking
       evil of magistrates or of ministers:
     * Doing to others as we would not they should do unto us:
     * Doing what we know is not for the glory of God: as
     * The putting on of gold and costly apparel:
     * The taking such diversions as cannot be used in the name of the
       Lord Jesus:
     * The singing those songs, or reading those books, which do not tend
       to the knowledge or love of God:
     * Softness and needless self-indulgence:
     * Laying up treasure upon earth:
     * Borrowing without a probability of paying or taking up goods
       without a probability of paying for them.

   4.?It is expected of all who continue in these societies that they
   should continue to evidence their desire of salvation:

   Secondly, By doing good, by being in every kind merciful after their
   power, as they have opportunity, doing good of every possible sort, and
   as far as is possible to all men:
     * To their bodies, of the ability which God giveth, by giving food to
       the hungry, by clothing the naked, by visiting or helping them that
       are sick, or in prison;
     * To their souls, by instructing, reproving, or exhorting all we have
       any intercourse with; trampling under foot that enthusiastic
       doctrine, that "we are not to do good, unless our hearts be free to
       it."
     * By doing good, especially to them that are of the household of
       faith, or groaning so to be; employing them preferably to others,
       buying one of another, (unless you can be served better elsewhere,)
       helping each other in business; and so much the more, because the
       world will love its own, and them only.
     * By all possible diligence and frugality, that the gospel be not
       blamed.
     * By running with patience the race that is set before them, denying
       themselves, and taking up their cross daily; submitting to bear the
       reproach of Christ, to be as the filth and offscouring of the
       world; and looking that men should say all manner of evil of them
       falsely for the Lord's sake.

   5.?It is expected of all who desire to continue in these societies that
   they should continue to evidence their desire of salvation,

   Thirdly, By attending upon all the ordinances of God: such are,
     * The public worship of God;
     * The ministry of the word, either read or expounded;
     * The supper of the Lord;
     * Family and private prayer;
     * Searching the Scriptures; and
     * Fasting or abstinence.

   6.?These are the general rules of our societies; all which we are
   taught of God to observe, even in his written word, which is the only
   rule, and the sufficient rule, both of our faith and practice. And all
   these we know his Spirit writes on every truly awakened heart. If there
   be any among us who observe them not, who habitually break any of them,
   let it be known unto them who watch over that soul as they that must
   give an account. We will admonish him of the error of his ways. We will
   bear with him for a season. But then, if he repent not, he hath no more
   place among us. We have delivered our own souls.

   The following rules concerning slavery, though I cannot find them
   either in the printed Minutes, [15] or in the Discipline which contains
   the above sections, Mr. Lee tells us, are the substance of what the
   conference did in reference to this subject.

   "Every member in our society who has slaves in those states where the
   law admit of freeing them, shall, after notice given him by the
   preacher, within twelve mouths (except in Virginia, and there within
   two years) legally execute and record an instrument, whereby he sets
   free every slave in his possession; those who are from forty to
   forty-five immediately, or at farthest at the age of forty-five; those
   who are between the ages of twenty-five and forty immediately, or
   within the course of five years; those who are between the ages of
   twenty and twenty-five immediately, or at farthest, at the age of
   thirty; those who are under the age of twenty, as soon as they are
   twenty-five at farthest. And every infant immediately on its birth.

   "Every person concerned who will not comply with these rules, shall
   have liberty quietly to withdraw from our society within twelve months
   following the notice being given him as aforesaid. Otherwise the
   assistant shall exclude him in the society.

   "No person holding slaves shall in future be admitted into society, or
   to the Lord's supper, till he previously comply with these rules
   concerning slavery. Those who buy or sell slaves, or give them away,
   unless on purpose to free them, shall be expelled immediately."

   "These rules," says Mr. Lee, "were short-lived." They indeed gave such
   general offense, and were found to be of such difficult execution that
   at the next conference, which was held about six mouths after their
   passage, they were so generally opposed, that we find the following
   minute respecting their suspension: --

   "It is recommended to all our brethren to suspend the execution of the
   minute on slavery till the deliberations of a future conference; and
   that an equal share of time he allowed all our members for
   consideration when the minute shall be put in force." It is then added
   in --

   "N. B. We do hold in the deepest abhorrence the practice of slavery,
   and shall not cease to seek its destruction by all wise and prudent
   means."

   As these rules were modified from time to time, it will not be
   necessary to take any farther notice of them than simply to say, that
   though those who framed them "abhorred the practice of slavery," they
   could not have considered it such a sin "as to exclude a man from the
   kingdom of grace and glory," else they never would, as honest men, have
   suspended their execution, as they did about six months after they were
   passed; nor did they, as some have seemed to suppose, insist on
   immediate and unconditional emancipation: for even the rule itself, had
   it not been suspended, provided only for a gradual emancipation, at
   farthest in five years from a certain age, where circumstances forbade
   it to be done immediately: But finding that even this gradual process
   could not be carried forward without producing a greater evil than it
   was designed to remove, the rule itself, mild and forbearing as it was
   in comparison to measures recently proposed, was suspended at the
   succeeding conference, in favor of those more wise and prudent means
   which the church has ever since used, and is now ready to use, for the
   extirpation of slavery.

   But, as before observed, it will not be necessary to notice the several
   modifications of the rules on slavery from one general conference to
   another until the present time, as they all partake of a similar
   character, intended to record the opposition of the church to the
   system, and to adopt such means to mitigate its evils, and finally, if
   possible, to do it away, as wisdom and prudence should dictate. As the
   rule now stands on the Discipline, it will be noticed at the proper
   time, only remarking here, that the item in the General Rules on
   slavery has remained unaltered to the present time, and is therefore
   expressive of the sense of the Methodist Episcopal Church upon this
   subject without variation.

    FROM THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH IN 1784, TO THE FIRST REGULAR GENERAL
    CONFERENCE IN 1792.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 1

    From the beginning of 1785 to the end of 1786.

   The important transactions we have detailed in the preceding chapter
   were found, upon experiment, to exert a beneficial influence upon the
   interests of true religion. And having closed the session in peace and
   with great unanimity of sentiment, the preachers went to their
   respective fields of labor with renewed courage and with great
   cheerfulness of mind.

   Mr. Freeborn Garrettson and Mr. James O. Cromwell about the middle of
   February took their departure for Nova Scotia; and after enduring many
   perils on the voyage, arrived in safety at their destined sphere of
   labor.

   At the close of the Revolutionary War, some members of the society had
   emigrated to that province of the British empire; and being in a
   destitute state as to religious instruction, they had sent an earnest
   request to Mr. Wesley to be supplied; and Dr. Coke had interested
   himself much in their behalf. Accordingly these brethren volunteered
   their services for this work. On their arrival they were cordially
   received at Halifax, where they landed. Here Mr. Garrettson found a few
   members of the society, some of whom had come from Europe, and some
   from the United States: and during his short continuance in this place,
   he preached several times with great satisfaction.

   Some time before the arrival of these missionaries, Mr. William Black
   had been instrumental in doing much good to the souls of the people by
   preaching in various places, particularly in New Brunswick and Halifax.
   Mr. Black gave the right hand of fellowship to Mr. Garrettson, and he
   entered upon his work in this Country with that zeal by which he had
   been distinguished in the United States, and many sinners were awakened
   and converted to God, and several societies formed.

   Here, however, as elsewhere, opposers of the pure doctrines of Christ
   were found, not only among the openly profane, but also among
   professors of godliness. Mr. Garrettson gives the following account of
   a people here called Allenites, taking their name from Mr. Allen, who
   was their principal leader: --

   "Some of them," says Mr. Garrettson, "seem to have the fear of God; but
   in general they are as deluded a people as I ever saw. Almost all of
   them preach in public. I was conversing with one who seems to be a
   principal person among them. She said she believed death would slay
   more sins for her than were ever destroyed before. As for sin,' said
   she, it cannot hurt me: not even adultery, murder, swearing,
   drunkenness, nor any other sin, can break the union between me and
   Christ.' They have passed judgment upon us, that we are neither
   Christians nor called to preach.

   "Thursday I preached at Mr. Woodworth's to a crowded audience. A little
   before preaching time, two old Calvinists came into my room to have a
   conversation with me before preaching. I understand,' said one of them,
   that you hold with falling from grace: I heard it, but did not know how
   to believe it, and should be glad to know whether you do deny the
   perseverance of the saints.' I answered, I do not, for my desire is
   that they should persevere: I do not hold with man's persevering in
   wickedness, neither do I believe that a man can have grace while he
   lives in sin. Let us take the Bible, and see what is said there. I read
   part of the 15th of John, and parts of several chapters in Hebrews,
   Romans, and Peter. Now, said I, this is the language of many other
   passages. We have no promise for any but such as do persevere to the
   end, and we have had many unhappy instances of men running well for a
   time, and then turning back: read the 18th chapter of Ezekiel. Now what
   harm can there be in enforcing our Lord's, the prophet's, and the
   apostles' exhortation? Very good,' said he. Why should we do it if
   there was no danger? and what harm can there be in the doctrine?
   Suppose you are a Christian, and your neighbor is one also; you believe
   in the unconditional perseverance of saints; he in the conditional:
   who, sir, is the safest? if you are right, surely he cannot fall. I
   never,' said he, 'saw so much in it before.' They stayed to hear the
   sermon, and afterward one said, I never heard these men before, but
   they are better than I thought.'

   "Friday morning I set out for Granville. I had not got far before a man
   came running out. Sir,' said he; I like part of your doctrine well, but
   part I do not like.' What part don't you like? You say, sir, that a
   saint may fall.' Will you answer me one question, said I. Do you know
   that you were ever converted? I do,' said he. Pray tell me how matters
   are at present between God and your soul. Why,' said he, it is a winter
   state.' But, said I, are you not living in open sin against God? He
   paused awhile. I ask, said I, in the fear of God, and desire an answer
   in truth. I confess,' said he, I am living in sin.' And yet you do not
   believe in falling from grace! I believe it because you have fallen.
   This is what you call a winter state! I call it lying in the arms of
   the wicked one; and you may talk as you will about your past
   experience, but I would not give a straw for your chance of heaven, if
   you die in this state. You are reconciling Christ and Belial together.
   O,' said he, I shall be raised up at the last day.' You will, said I;
   but, unless you repent, it will be to be cast into the lake of fire. He
   seemed much affected, and left me.

   "January 19th, I preached opposite Granville, to a number of serious
   hearers, and was invited home to dinner by an old gentleman, who, soon
   after we were seated at table, said, I understand you preach
   perfection.' I do, said I, and have done so for a number of years; and
   shall do so as long as I find the doctrine in the Bible. Why, sir,'
   said he, Paul was not perfect: he complains of a thorn in the side.'
   The heart is the place for sin, said I, and not the side. He then
   mentioned several other passages of Scripture which he thought were
   opposed to holiness of heart, which I explained to him. Pray, said I,
   let us come to the point at once. Do you believe that an unholy
   creature can enter into heaven? No.' Pray, when is sin to be destroyed?
   At death.' You must then hold with death as being part of a saviour, or
   with a purgatory after death, or you must come to perfection on this
   side the grave. He sat amazed, and seemed to give up the argument. We
   rose from the table. I went to prayer; then went on my journey, and
   preached at six o'clock in the court house. When I left the old man, he
   desired me to make his house my home. I left Fletcher's Checks with
   him. Shortly after, I received a few lines from him to this effect: --
   I believe you to be a servant of God. I hope the Lord will bless you,
   and those that sent you here. I want to see you at my house at every
   opportunity. I thank you for the book.'"

   Mr. Garrettson, in another place, gives the following summary of their
   leading absurdities: -- "1. They think they can tell whether a person
   is a Christian at first sight. 2. They say that we are leading people
   blindfolded to hell. 3. They are, they say, as sure of heaven as if
   they were already there, for sin cannot hurt them." "I never met with
   such a people in my life. There are about fifty of them in Liverpool."

   Soon after his arrival, Mr. Garrettson received a letter from Mr.
   Wesley, of which the following is an extract: --

   "I am glad brother Cromwell and you have undertaken that labor of love,
   the visiting Nova Scotia, and doubt not but you act in full concert
   with the little handful who were almost alone till you came. It will be
   the wisest way to make all those who desire to join together thoroughly
   acquainted with the whole Methodist plan, and to accustom them, from
   the very beginning, to the accurate observance of all our rules. Let
   none of them rest in being half Christians. Whatever they do, let them
   do it with their might, and it will be well, as soon as any of them
   find peace with God, to exhort them to go on to perfection. The more
   explicitly and strongly you press all believers to aspire after full
   sanctification as attainable now by simple faith, the more the whole
   work of God will prosper.

   "I do not expect any great matters from the bishop. I doubt his eye is
   not single, and if it be not, he will do little good to you or any one
   else. It may be a comfort to you that you have no need of him: you want
   nothing which he can give.

   "It is a noble proposal of brother Marchington; but; doubt it will not
   take place. You do not know the of the English Methodists. They do not
   roll in money like many of the American Methodists. It is with the
   utmost difficulty that we can raise five or six hundred pounds a year
   to supply our contingent expenses, so that it is entirely impracticable
   to raise five hundred pounds among them to build houses in America. It
   is true, they might do much; but it is a sad observation, they that
   have most money have usually least grace. The peace of God be with all
   your spirits.

   I am your affectionate friend and brother,

   "J. Wesley."

   As the societies in this province did not long remain connected with
   the church in the United States, for we find them on the British
   Minutes for 1787, it is thought most advisable to complete the notice
   of the work there in this place. It appears from the Life of Mr.
   Garrettson that he continued his labors in this province, traveling
   from place to place, and often exposed to many temporal hardships and
   privations, until April 10th, 1787, when he embarked for the United
   States, leaving behind him, as evidences of his fidelity and success in
   his Master's work, about six hundred members in the societies. While in
   this country, Mr. Garrettson says, --

   "I traversed the mountains and valleys, frequently on foot, with my
   knapsack on my back, guided by Indian paths in the wilderness, when it
   was not expedient to take a horse; and I had often to wade through
   morasses half leg deep in mud and water, frequently satisfying my
   hunger with a piece of bread and pork from my knapsack, quenching my
   thirst from a brook, and resting my weary limbs on the leaves of the
   trees. Thanks be to God! he compensated me for all my toil, for many
   precious souls were awakened and converted to God."

   This extract will show the manner in which the early Methodist
   preachers, in imitation of their divine Lord, "went about doing good."

   This year, also, Methodism was introduced into the city of Charleston,
   South Carolina. In the latter part of February, Bishop Asbury, Jesse
   Lee, and Henry Willis set off on a visit to this place. Mr. Willis
   preceded the others, and gave out their appointments; and after
   preaching in sundry places on their way, they arrived in Charleston on
   Saturday, February 26th, and on Sabbath morning Mr. Lee preached in an
   old meeting-house belonging to the Baptists, which had been procured
   for that purpose. While here they lodged with Mr. Edgar Wells, a
   respectable merchant, who, though a man of the world, courteously
   entertained the messengers of the Lord. On their arrival he was
   preparing to attend the theater, but his plans of amusement were
   abandoned, and the worship of God was set up in his family. The
   consequence was, that he became awakened to a sense of his sinfulness,
   and, after a struggle for about ten days, was brought into gospel
   liberty.

   This was the commencement of Methodism in this place; for although Mr.
   Wesley visited Charleston in 1736, and Mr. Pillmore in 1773, their
   visits were but transient, and left no permanent impression upon the
   minds of the people. After preaching a few times, Mr. Lee left the city
   with a view to labor in other places, but Bishop Asbury remained until
   the 9th of March, preaching every evening, and sometimes in the
   morning, to the people, explaining to them "the essential doctrines" of
   Methodism; and he says, "I loved and pitied the people, and left some
   under gracious impressions."

   Though it will be anticipating the chronological order of the history a
   little, I think it best to give the following account, taken chiefly
   from that furnished by the Rev. James O. (now Bishop) Andrew, for the
   Methodist Magazine and Quarterly Review.

   It seems that, on the departure of Bishop Asbury, Mr. Willis was left
   in charge of the work. Being a man of general intelligence, of deep
   piety, and of amiable manners, and devoting himself entirely to his
   work, he made a favorable impression upon many minds, and soon
   succeeded in forming a small society. Being informed that they could no
   longer occupy the old house in which they had hitherto convened, and
   the private house kindly offered them by Mrs. Stoll soon becoming too
   small to contain the increased number of hearers, they began to think
   seriously of building a house of worship, and soon commenced the work.
   While this was in progress they continued their meetings in an
   unfinished house which had been offered them by a friend. This house,
   begun in 1786, and completed in 1787, was situated in Cumberland
   Street, and has been the spiritual birthplace of many souls. Bishop
   Asbury visited the place in 1786, and again in 1787, when he met Dr.
   Coke, who had recently arrived from England. "Here," he says, "we have
   a spacious house prepared for us; and the congregations are crowded and
   solemn."

   Being thus furnished with a convenient house of worship, and the word
   and ordinances of the gospel, the work of God prospered more than it
   had done heretofore. It did not, however, go on without opposition. In
   addition to what arose from the natural enmity of the human heart when
   it comes in contact with the pure doctrines and precepts of
   Christianity, Methodism received a wound in Charleston from one of its
   professed friends and public advocates. In 1787, the Rev. Beverly Allen
   was placed in charge; as an elder, of the society in this place. He was
   a man of great popularity as a preacher, had married into a respectable
   family, and acquired much influence in the community. This unhappy man
   fell from his steadfastness, and in his fall inflicted a wound upon the
   cause from which it did not recover for a long time. This, together
   with the difficulties which arose from the state of slavery as it
   existed in all the southern states, made the situation of a Methodist
   minister extremely unpleasant, especially when it is considered that
   the mistaken but well-meant zeal of Dr. Coke, in his open opposition to
   slavery, tended much to irritate the public mind on that subject. The
   cause, however, gradually gained ground, and was acquiring the public
   confidence, until the year 1791, when the church was convulsed by the
   conduct of the Rev. William Hamett, who formed a division, put himself
   at the head of a party, and fulminated his anathemas at the head of
   Bishop Asbury and others.

   Mr. Hamett, also, unfortunately for the cause against which he arrayed
   himself, was a man of popular talents and gentlemanly manners, and had
   acquired considerable influence in the community, and hence the
   facility with which he accomplished his design. Bishop Asbury, alluding
   to the secession of Mr. Hamett, says, "He had three grand objections to
   us, 1. The American preachers and people insulted him. 2. His name was
   not printed on our minutes. 3. The Nota Bene minute was directed
   against him." "We are considered by him as seceders from Methodism!
   because we do not wear gowns and powder, and because we did not pay
   sufficient respect to Mr. Wesley." This was the pretense; but it is
   manifest that Mr. Hamett, who had recently arrived from the West
   Indies, was not willing to submit to the authority of the conference,
   and to Bishop Asbury.

   The minute to which Mr. Asbury alludes, was in these words: -- "Mark
   well! Our brethren and friends are desired to be more cautious how they
   receive strange preachers, especially to preach; unless their names are
   in the minutes, or they can show a parchment or certificate from a
   presiding elder, or some elder in the district they may say they come
   from." This, however, instead of being directed against Mr. Hamett, who
   was a regular preacher from the European connection, was designed to
   guard the people against those impostors who endeavored to palm
   themselves upon the public as Methodist preachers. The accusations
   which Mr. H. preferred against Bishop Asbury were amply refuted; and
   that apostolic man lived to witness the clouds of reproach thus raised
   against him dispersed by the bright rays from the sun of truth. Mr. H.,
   however, succeeded in establishing himself at the head of a party,
   built him a house of worship in the city of Charleston, and his society
   were distinguished by the name of "Primitive Methodists." Though many
   of his mistaken followers returned afterward to the church they had
   left, and some joined other communions, he remained at the head of a
   small sect until his death, when Trinity Church, as it was called,
   passed into the hands of the Protestant Episcopalians, and finally it
   reverted back, by an amicable arrangement between the parties, to the
   Methodist Episcopal Church, where it remains to the present day. I
   shall not anticipate farther the order of events, but notice other
   particulars in their proper place.

   Mr. Asbury having been elected and consecrated to the office of general
   superintendent, entered immediately upon his great work, traveling from
   place to place, preaching to the people, and making collections for the
   college, which had been recently commenced.

   In mentioning the college, I am reminded of the necessity of giving an
   account of this institution, as it belongs most properly to this period
   of our history. Soon after the arrival of Dr. Coke in 1784, he and Mr.
   Asbury entered into a consultation respecting the expediency of
   establishing a literary institution for the education of the sons of
   our preachers and others who might wish to share in its benefits.
   Bishop Asbury tells us that he desired a school, but as Dr. Coke
   pleaded for a college, the conference, when the subject was submitted
   to them, decided in favor of Dr. Coke's plan, and measures were adopted
   to carry it into effect. As all these things belong to the history of
   the times, and will show the views by which the projectors of this
   institution were actuated, I think it proper to give the whole plan, as
   it was published by the superintendents immediately on the adjournment
   of the Christmas conference.

   "The Plan for erecting a College, intended to advocate religion in
   America, to be presented to the principal members and friends of the
   Methodist Episcopal Church.

   "The college is built at Abingdon in Maryland, on a healthy spot,
   enjoying a fine air and very extensive prospect. It is to receive for
   education and board the sons of the elders and preachers of the
   Methodist Church, poor orphans, and the sons of the subscribers and of
   other friends. It will be expected that all our friends who send their
   children to the college will, if they be able, pay a moderate sum for
   their education and board: the rest will be taught and boarded, and, if
   our finances will allow of it, clothed gratis. The institution is also
   intended for the benefit of our young men who are called to preach,
   that they may receive a measure of that improvement which is highly
   expedient as a preparative for public service. A teacher of the
   languages, with an assistant, will be provided, as also an English
   master, to teach with the utmost propriety both to read and speak the
   English language: nor shall any other branch of literature be omitted
   which may be thought necessary for any of the students. Above all,
   especial care shall be taken that due attention be paid to the religion
   and morals of the children, and to the exclusion of all such as
   continue of an ungovernable temper. The college will be under the
   presidentship of the bishops of our Church for the time being; and is
   to be supported by yearly collections throughout our circuits, and any
   endowments which our friends may think proper to give and bequeath.

   "Three objects of considerable magnitude we have in view in the
   instituting of this college.

   "The first is a provision for the sons of our married ministers and
   preachers.

   "The wisdom and love of God hath now thrust out a large number of
   laborers into his harvest: men who desire nothing on earth but to
   promote the glory of God, by saving their own souls and those that hear
   them. And those to whom they minister spiritual things are willing to
   minister to them of their temporal things; so that they have food to
   eat and raiment to put on, and are content therewith.

   "A competent provision is likewise made for the wives of married
   preachers.

   "Yet one considerable difficulty lies on those that have boys, when
   they grow too big to be under their mother's direction. Having no
   father to govern and instruct them, they are exposed to a thousand
   temptations. To remedy this is one motive that induces us to lay before
   our friends the intent of the college, that these little ones may have
   all the instruction they are capable of, together with all things
   necessary for the body.

   "In this view our college will become one of the noblest charities that
   can be conceived. How reasonable is the institution! Is it fit that the
   children of those who leave wife and all that is dear to save souls
   from death, should want what is needful either for soul or body? Ought
   not we to supply what the parent cannot, because of his labors in the
   gospel? How excellent will be the effect of this institution! The
   preacher, eased of this weight, can the more cheerfully go on in his
   labor. And perhaps many of these children may hereafter fill up the
   place of those that shall rest from their labors.

   "The second object we have in view is the education and support of poor
   orphans; and surely we need not enumerate the many happy consequences
   arising from such a charity. Innumerable blessings concenter in it; not
   only the immediate relief of the objects of our charity, but the
   ability given them, under the providence of God, to provide for
   themselves through the remainder of their lives.

   The last, though not perhaps the least object in view, is the
   establishment of a seminary for the children of our competent friends,
   where learning and religion may go hand in hand; where every advantage
   may be obtained which may promote the prosperity of the present life,
   without endangering the morals and religion of the children through
   those temptations to which they are too much exposed in most of the
   public schools. This is an object of importance indeed: and here all
   the tenderest feelings of the parent's heart range on our side.

   "But the expense of such an undertaking will be very large; and the
   best means we could think of at our late conference to accomplish our
   design was, to desire the assistance of all those in every place who
   wish well to the work of God: who long to see sinners converted to God,
   and the kingdom of Christ set up in all the earth.

   "All who are thus minded, and more especially our own friends who form
   our congregations, have an opportunity now of showing their love to the
   gospel. Now promote, as far as in you lies, one of the noblest
   charities in the world. Now forward, as you are able, one of the most
   excellent designs that ever was set on foot in this country. Do what
   you can to comfort the parents who give up their all for you, and to
   give their children cause to bless you. You will be no poorer for what
   you do on such an occasion. God is a good paymaster. And you know, in
   doing this you lend unto the Lord: in due time he shall repay you.

   "The students will be instructed in English, Latin, Greek, logic,
   rhetoric, history, geography, natural philosophy, and astronomy. To
   these languages and sciences shall be added, when the finances of our
   college will admit of it, the Hebrew, French, and German languages.

   "But our first object shall be, to answer the design of Christian
   education, by forming the minds of the youth, through divine aid, to
   wisdom and holiness; by instilling into their tender minds the
   principles of true religion; speculative, experimental, and practical,
   and training them in the ancient way, that they may be rational,
   Scriptural Christians. For this purpose we shall expect and enjoin it,
   not only on the president and tutors, but also upon our elders,
   deacons, and preachers, to embrace every opportunity of instructing the
   students in the great branches of the Christian religion.

   "And this is one principal reason why we do not admit students
   indiscriminately into our college. For we are persuaded that the
   promiscuous admission of all sorts of youth into a seminary of learning
   is pregnant with many bad consequences. For are the students likely
   (suppose they possessed it) to retain much religion in a college where
   all that offer are admitted, however corrupted already in principle as
   well as practice? And what wonder, when (as too frequently it happens)
   the parents themselves have no more religion than their offspring?

   "For the same reason we have consented to receive children of seven
   years of age, as we wish to have the opportunity of teaching their
   young ideas how to shoot,' and gradually forming their minds, though
   the divine blessing, almost from their infancy, to holiness and
   heavenly wisdom as well as human learning. And we may add, that we are
   thoroughly convinced, with the great Milton, (to whose admirable
   treatise on education we refer you,) that it is highly expedient for
   every youth to begin and finish his education at the same place: that
   nothing can be more irrational and absurd than to break this off in the
   middle, and to begin it again at a different place, and perhaps in a
   quite different manner. And on this account we earnestly desire that
   the parents and others who may be concerned, will maturely consider the
   last observation, and not send their children to our seminary if they
   are not to complete their education there, or at least make some
   considerable proficiency in the languages, and in the arts and
   sciences.

   "It is also our particular desire, that all who shall be educated in
   our college may be kept at the utmost distance, as from vice in
   general, so in particular from softness and effeminacy of manners.

   "We shall therefore inflexibly insist on their rising early in the
   morning; and we are convinced by constant observation and experience,
   that this is of vast importance both to body and mind. It is of
   admirable use either for preserving a good, or improving a bad
   constitution. It is of peculiar service in all nervous complaints, both
   in preventing and in removing them. And by thus strengthening the
   various organs of the body, it enables the mind to put forth its utmost
   exertions.

   "On the same principle we prohibit play in the strongest terms: and in
   this we have the two greatest writers on the subject that perhaps any
   age has produced (Mr. Locke and Mr. Rousseau) of our sentiments for
   though the latter was essentially mistaken in his religious system, yet
   his wisdom in other respects, and extensive genius, are indisputably
   acknowledged. The employments, therefore, which we have chosen for the
   recreation of the students are such as are of greatest public utility,
   agriculture and architecture; studies more especially necessary for a
   new-settled country and of consequence the instructing of our youth in
   all the practical branches of those important arts will be an effectual
   method of rendering them more useful to their country. Agreeably to
   this idea, the greatest statesman that perhaps ever shone in the annals
   of history, Peter, the Russian emperor, who was deservedly styled the
   Great, disdained not to stoop to the employment of a ship carpenter.
   Nor was it rare, during the purest times of the Roman republic, to see
   the conquerors of nations and deliverer, of their country return with
   all simplicity and cheerfulness to the exercise of the plow. In
   conformity to this sentiment, one of the completest poetic pieces of
   antiquity (the Georgic of Virgil is written on the subject of
   husbandry; by the perusal of which, and submission to the above
   regulations, the students may delightfully unite the theory and the
   practice together. We say delightfully, for we do not entertain the
   most distant thought of turning these employments into drudgery or
   slavery, but into pleasing recreations for the mind and body.

   "In teaching the languages, care shall be taken to read those authors,
   and those only, who join together the purity, the strength, and the
   elegance of their several tongues. And the utmost caution shall be used
   that nothing immodest be found in any of our books.

   "But this is not all. We shall take care that our books be not only
   inoffensive but useful; that they contain as much strong sense, and as
   much genuine morality as possible. As far, therefore, as is consistent
   with the foregoing observations, a choice and universal library shall
   be provided for the use of the students.

   "Our annual subscription is intended for the support of the charitable
   part of the institution. We have in the former part of this address
   enlarged so fully on the nature and excellency of the charity, that no
   more need be said. The relieving our traveling ministers and preachers,
   by educating, boarding, and clothing their sons, is a charity of the
   most noble and extensive kind, not only toward the immediate subjects
   of it, but also toward the public in general; enabling those flames of
   fire,' who might otherwise be obliged to confine themselves to an
   exceedingly contracted sphere of action for the support of their
   families, to carry the savor of the gospel to the remotest corners of
   these United States.

   "The four guineas a year for tuition, we are persuaded, cannot be
   lowered, if we give the students that finished education which we are
   determined they shall have. And though our principal object is to
   instruct them in the doctrines, spirit, and practice of Christianity,
   yet we trust that our college will in time send forth men that will be
   blessings to their country in every laudable office and employment of
   life, thereby uniting the two greatest ornaments of intelligent beings,
   which are too often separated, deep learning and genuine religion.

   "The rules and regulations with which you are here presented, have been
   weighed and digested in our conference: but we also submit them to your
   judgment, as we shall be truly thankful for your advice, as well as
   your prayers for the success of the college, even where the
   circumstances of things will not render it expedient to you to favor us
   with your charity. And we shall esteem ourselves happy, if we be
   favored with any new light, whether from the members of our own Church
   or of any other, whereby they may be abridged, enlarged, or in any
   other way improved, that the institution may be as near perfection as
   possible.

   The site selected for the college buildings, which was on a rising
   ground in the town of Abingdon, about twenty-five miles from Baltimore,
   is thus described by Dr. Coke: --

   The situation delights me more than ever. There is not, I believe, a
   point of it, from whence the eye has not a view of at least twenty
   miles; and in some parts the prospect extends even to fifty miles in
   length. The water part forms one of the most beautiful views in the
   United States; the Chesapeake Bay in all its grandeur, with a fine
   navigable river, the Susquehanna, which empties itself into it, lying
   exposed to view through a great extent of country."

   It was on this spot that a noble brick building was erected, one
   hundred and eight feet in length, and forty in breadth; and the house
   was conveniently divided for lodging the students, and for recitation
   rooms, &c. Through the solicitations of Dr. Coke and Bishop Asbury,
   nearly five thousand dollars had been secured by subscriptions and
   donations, when they commenced building; and before the rooms were
   entirely finished a school was opened with a few scholars. On the 8th,
   9th, and 10th days of December, 1787, the college was opened with
   religious exercises, and Bishop Asbury preached a sermon on each day,
   the dedication sermon being delivered on Sabbath, from 2 Kings iv, 40,
   "O, thou man of God, there is death in the pot." Whether the selection
   of this text was ominous or not of the fate of the institution, after
   being in successful operation for about ten years, it was consumed by
   fire. Bishop Asbury makes the following remarks on being notified of
   the destruction of the buildings: --

   "We have now a second and confirmed account that Cokesbury College is
   consumed to ashes, a sacrifice of ten thousand pounds in about ten
   years! The foundation was laid 1785, and it was born December 7, 1795.
   Its enemies may rejoice, and its friends need not mourn. Would any man
   give me ten thousand pounds a year to do and suffer again what I have
   done for that house, I would not do it."

   It seems to have been the opinion of Bishop Asbury, that this
   destruction of the college buildings was an indication of divine
   Providence that it was no part of the duty of the Methodist Episcopal
   Church to engage in founding and raising up colleges. It appears to us,
   however, that on the same principle of reasoning, we should refuse to
   build a church, or a dwelling house, or even to embark in any business,
   which might be injured by the elements. Job's repeated losses were
   permitted to try his patience, and this might have been permitted for a
   similar effect on the church.

   But although Bishop Asbury was dispirited in respect to building
   colleges, Dr. Coke, encouraged by the generosity of a number of wealthy
   friends in the vicinity of Abingdon, who sympathized with the
   sufferers, and also felt a deep interest in the cause of education,
   determined to make another effort. To aid him in his design, a number
   of friends in the city of Baltimore, after consulting together,
   immediately subscribed about four thousand five hundred dollars toward
   erecting a new building on the same premises. Ascertaining, however,
   that there was a large building in Baltimore which would answer the
   purpose, they purchased the premises for the sum of about twenty two
   thousand dollars. The ground and building thus purchased being more
   than was needed for the college, the brethren in Baltimore determined
   to erect a new church on a part of the premises. This was accordingly
   done, and the church and college were fitted up for use, and the
   college was opened with a fair prospect of success, even more promising
   than what had appeared in Cokesbury College; but unhappily a similar
   fate awaited it.

   Through the imprudence of a few boys who had been making a bonfire with
   some shavings in an adjoining house, the flames were communicated to
   the house in which they were assembled, and thence to the church and
   college, which were, after ineffectual attempts to extinguish the
   flames, entirely consumed. Thus were the hopes of the friends of
   education again blasted by the sudden destruction of these buildings,
   by which the Methodists lost not less than forty-four thousand dollars,
   and the cause of learning was abandoned in despair by the Methodist
   Episcopal Church for a number of years. Other denominations, however,
   in the city of Baltimore, sympathized with the Methodists in the loss
   of their church, and offered their churches for them to assemble in
   until they could repair their own. This generous offer was thankfully
   accepted, and they occupied these houses until they succeeded in
   erecting another.

   Having thus traced the commencement and termination of this laudable
   effort to diffuse a knowledge of literature and science among the
   people, we will now return to notice the progress of the general work.
   Immediately after the adjournment of the conference in Baltimore, Dr.
   Coke returned to Europe. The doctor's talents as a preacher, his
   Christian and gentlemanly deportment, and the disinterested zeal he had
   manifested for the welfare of Methodism in these United States, gained
   for him a great reputation among the people generally, and gave him an
   influence of a commanding character; and his enjoyments among his
   brethren would have been unalloyed had be not given offense,
   particularly to the people of Virginia, by his pointed, and, as he
   himself afterward acknowledged, imprudent manner of preaching against
   slavery. He was, however, rescued from the violence of a mob who had
   assembled for the purpose of wreaking their vengeance upon him, by the
   timely and resolute interference of a Christian magistrate and a
   military officer, and Dr. Coke was permitted to pursue his way
   unmolested.

   It seems that heretofore there had been held only one regular
   conference in a year; for though some of the preachers had assembled in
   separate places for the dispatch of their local affairs, the regular
   conference was considered one and indivisible as to all matters of a
   general character; but as the work enlarged, new circuits formed, and
   additional laborers entered the field, and these scattered over such a
   large surface of country, it became inconvenient for all the preachers
   to assemble together in one place; hence this year there were held
   three conferences; one at Green Hills, in North Carolina, April 20th;
   another at Mr. Mason's, Brunswick county, Virginia, May 1st; and
   another at Baltimore on the 1st day of June. But though the business
   was transacted in three separate conferences, their doings appeared in
   the minutes as one because nothing, except the stationing the
   preachers, was considered binding which was done in one conference
   unless approved by all the rest.

   The following seven new circuits were added to the list this year:
   Georgia, in the state of Georgia; Charleston, Georgetown, and Broad
   River, in South Carolina; New River, in North Carolina; Lancaster, in
   Virginia; and St. Mary's, in Maryland. The stations in Nova Scotia,
   before mentioned, and Antigua, in the West Indies, were also returned
   on the minutes. There were very considerable revivals of religion this
   year in the south and north, but the greatest work was on the eastern
   shore of Maryland, and in some parts of New Jersey; so that the
   increase of members was three thousand and twelve, and of preachers
   twenty-one: the whole number of members being eighteen thousand --
   preachers one hundred and four.

   The origin of the presiding elder's office may be traced to this year,
   though those who had charge of several circuits were not so denominated
   in the minutes until 1789. The office originated in this way: at the
   organization of the Church in 1784, but twelve out of the whole number
   of preachers were elected and ordained elders, and hence many of the
   circuits were destitute of any officer who was authorized to administer
   the ordinances, as a deacon could only assist at the celebration of the
   Lord's supper. To remedy this defect, and to supply the people with the
   ordinances regularly, several circuits were linked together, and put
   under the charge of an elder, whose duty it was to visit each circuit
   quarterly, preach to the people, hold love-feasts, and administer the
   sacrament of the Lord's supper.

   As the Church had now become regularly organized, and the several
   offices provided for as they have continued with but little variation
   to the present time, perhaps this may be the most suitable place to
   give a short analysis of the several parts of the entire economy, as
   provided for in the Discipline, that the reader may have the whole
   before him at one view.
    1. There is the society, which includes all the members of the church
       attached to any particular place.
    2. The classes, which originally consisted of about twelve persons in
       each, but unhappily have often increased to from twenty to forty,
       who meet together weekly for mutual edification.
    3. The class leader has charge of a class, and it is his duty to see
       each person in his class once a week, to inquire how their souls
       prosper, and to receive what they are willing to give for the
       support of the church and poor.
    4. The stewards, who are chosen by the quarterly conference, on the
       nomination of the ruling preacher, have charge of all the money
       collected for the support of the ministry, the poor, and for
       sacramental occasions, and disburse it as the Discipline directs.
    5. The trustees have charge of the church property, to hold it in
       trust for the use of the Methodist Episcopal Church. These are
       elected by the people, in those states where the laws so provide,
       in other places as the Discipline directs.
    6. There are the exhorters, who receive their license from the
       quarterly-meeting conference, and have the privilege of holding
       meetings for exhortation and prayer.
    7. A preacher is one that holds a license, and is authorized to
       preach, but not to baptize or administer the Lord's supper. He may
       be either a traveling or local preacher. A local preacher generally
       follows some secular employment for a livelihood, and preaches on
       Sabbath and at other times occasionally, without any temporal
       emolument. A traveling preacher devotes himself entirely to the
       work of the ministry, and is supported by the people among whom he
       labors. All these, after being recommended by the class to which
       each respectively belong, or by a leaders' meeting, receive their
       license from a quarterly meeting conference, signed by a presiding
       elder.
    8. A deacon holds a parchment from a bishop, and is authorized, in
       addition to discharging the duties of a preacher, to solemnize
       matrimony, to bury the dead, to baptize, and to assist the elder in
       administering the Lord's supper. It is his duty also to seek after
       the sick and poor, and administer to their comfort.
    9. An elder, besides doing the duties above enumerated, has full
       authority to administer all the ordinances of God's house. These
       generally, whenever a sufficient number can be had, have the charge
       of circuits, and the administration of the several parts of the
       discipline of the church.
   10. A presiding elder has charge of several circuits, called
       collectively a district. It is his duty to visit each circuit once
       a quarter, to preach, and administer the ordinances, to call
       together the traveling and local preachers, exhorters, stewards,
       and leaders of the circuit for a quarterly conference, and in the
       absence of a bishop, to receive, try, suspend, or expel preachers,
       as the Discipline directs. He is appointed to his charge by the
       bishop.
   11. A bishop is elected by the General Conference, and is amenable to
       that body for his official and moral conduct. It is his duty to
       travel through the work at large, to superintend the spiritual and
       temporal affairs of the Church, to preside in the annual and the
       general conferences, to ordain such as are elected by an annual
       conference to the office of deacons or elders, and to appoint the
       preachers to their stations.
   12. A leaders' meeting is composed of all the class leaders in any one
       circuit or station, in which the preacher in charge presides. Here
       the weekly class collections are paid into the hands of the
       stewards, and inquiry is made into the state of the classes,
       delinquents reported, and the sick and poor inquired after.
   13. A quarterly meeting conference is composed of all the traveling and
       local preachers, exhorters, stewards, and leaders belonging to any
       particular station or circuit, in which the presiding elder
       presides, or in his absence the preacher in charge. Here exhorters
       and local preachers are licensed, and preachers recommended to an
       annual conference to be received into the traveling ministry; and
       likewise appeals are heard from any member of the church, who may
       appeal from the decision of a committee.
   14. An annual conference is composed of all the traveling preachers,
       deacons, and elders within a specified district of country. These
       are executive and judicial bodies, acting under rules prescribed
       the by the General Conference. Here the characters and conduct of
       all the traveling preachers within the bounds of the conference are
       examined yearly; applicants for admission into the traveling
       ministry, if accounted worthy, are received, continued on trial, or
       dropped, as the case may be: appeals from local preachers which may
       be presented, are heard and decided; and those who are eligible to
       deacon's or elder's orders are elected. An annual conference
       possesses original jurisdiction over all its members, and may
       therefore try, acquit, suspend, expel, or locate any of them, as
       the Discipline in such cases provides. For the specific duties of
       an annual conference, see Discipline, p.28.
   15. The General Conference assembles quadrennially, and is composed of
       a certain number of delegates, elected by the annual conferences.
       It has power to revise any part of the Discipline, not prohibited
       by the restrictive regulations, (which will be more particularly
       noticed hereafter,) to elect the book agents and editors, and the
       bishops; to hear and determine appeals of preachers from the
       decisions of annual conferences; to review the acts of those
       conferences generally; to examine into the general administration
       of the bishops for the four preceding years; and, if accused, to
       try, censure, acquit, or condemn a bishop. This is the highest
       judicatory of the Church.
   16. That the reader may have a complete view of our entire economy, so
       far as it was organized at the time of which we now speak, it is
       necessary to notice one more usage, and that is, the holding of
       love-feasts. Those who are acquainted with the history of the
       primitive church, know perfectly well that they had what were
       called Agape, (Agapa,) or feasts of charity, in which they ate and
       drank together, in token of their love and fellowship to and with
       each other, and in which they bound themselves not to betray one
       another into the hands of their enemies. In imitation of these
       primitive feasts of charity, Mr. Wesley established his
       love-feasts, and they have been continued to the present time in
       the Church. Without pretending that every minutia observed in these
       social meetings has an exact archetype in those primitive
       assemblies, it is sufficient that they resemble them in the main
       particulars.

   Here believers only, and those who profess to be seeking redemption in
   the blood of Christ, are admitted, generally on the presentation of a
   printed ticket, which is a certificate of membership in the Church.
   After singing an appropriate hymn, and prayer, a small piece of bread
   and a little water are taken by each person as a token of Christian
   fellowship, and then some time, usually about one hour, is spent for
   each one who chooses to relate his or her experience and enjoyment of
   divine things. A collection is then made for the benefit of the poor,
   when the assembly is dismissed, after singing and prayer, by the
   benediction. These meetings have been found peculiarly profitable to
   the souls of God's people.

   17. There is one other item in the economy of our Church which ought to
   be mentioned in this connection, and that is the salary of the
   ministry, and the mode in which it is raised. At the time of which we
   are now speaking, the allowance of a single traveling preacher was
   sixty-four dollars per annum, and his traveling expenses, and double
   that sum to one who was married. Out of this amount he had to furnish
   himself with clothes, horse, and traveling apparatus, his board being
   included among his traveling or extra expenses.

   This was raised by the voluntary contributions of the people in weekly
   class, and quarterly collections a yearly fifth collection was made in
   all the congregations, and with the small avails arising from the sale
   of books, was brought to the annual conference, and appropriated to
   make up the deficiencies of those who did not receive their full
   allowance on the circuits, and for the widows and worn-out preachers.

   Having given this outline of our economy, the reader will be able to
   understand the meaning of such technical phrases as quarterly, annual,
   and general conference, society and class meeting, love-feasts,
   exhorter, preacher, deacon, elder, and bishop, whenever they occur,
   without further explanation.

   This year, for the first time, the minutes contained, in connection
   with the names of those preachers who had died in the work during the
   preceding year, short sketches of their character. As, however, the
   insertion of these sketches would swell this history beyond its
   destined bulk, the most of them will be abridged, reserving however the
   privilege of extending such as were the most eminent for their labors
   and success in the work. The following record concerning the deaths of
   preachers is found in the minutes of this year: --
    1. Caleb B. Peddicord, a man of sorrows, and like his Master,
       acquainted with grief; but a man dead to the world, and much
       devoted to God.
    2. George Mair, a man of affliction, but of great patience and
       resignation, and of an excellent understanding.

   Samuel Rowe, James Martin, and James Morris, were located; and Le Roy
   Cole was expelled.

   Numbers in Society: Members this year, 18,000, last year 14,988;
   Preachers this year, 104, last year, 83; Increase in Members, 3,612;
   Increase in Preachers, 21.

   1786. There were three conferences held this year; one at Salisbury, in
   North Carolina, on the 21st of February; another at Jones's chapel in
   Virginia, on the 18th of April; and the third at Baltimore, on the 8th
   day of May. Five new circuits were added to the list, namely, Santee
   and Peedee, in North Carolina, Newark in New Jersey, and Kentucky, in
   the state of Kentucky.

   As this is the first mention of Kentucky in our minutes, and as I have
   given a sketch of the first settlements and general condition of the
   thirteen original States, it seems proper to give some account of this,
   and also of the other new states, in the order in which they were
   visited by the Methodist ministry. For though Kentucky was not received
   as a member of the American confederacy [Union] until the year 1792,
   yet as this [1786] was the year it was first entered by a Methodist
   preacher, this seems to be the most suitable time and pace to notice
   these things.

   In 1775, Colonel Daniel Boone, one of the most famous of American
   pioneers, first penetrated into the woods of Kentucky, which was then a
   part of Virginia. His reports of the fertility of the soil, and of the
   facilities for forming settlements, soon induced other hardy
   adventurers from Virginia to join him; and thus a way was opened for
   the cultivation of this wilderness, which, after the war of the
   revolution had closed, was so rapidly settled, that in 1792 it was
   formed into an independent government, and received as one of the
   states of the Union.

   The character of the first settlers, being principally from Virginia,
   partook of that chivalry and hospitality for which the Virginians are
   distinguished, though as to religion and morals much could not be then
   said in their favor. At the time of which we now speak, there were but
   few inhabitants, probably not over twenty thousand, in the whole
   territory, and these were found in scattered groups through the
   country.

   The settlements were first visited by the Baptist preachers; but though
   they exerted some influence among the people in favor of religion, yet
   it appears from the history of those times, that their general neglect
   of the Sabbath, their intermeddling much with politics, and their
   strong bias for Antinomian doctrines, prevented them from doing the
   good they otherwise might have done. In 1784, a Presbyterian minister
   settled at Harrodsburgh, in Mercer county, and in the same year a
   seceder took charge of a congregation in Lexington.

   But, as in many other instances we have mentioned, the pioneers of
   Methodism in this country were some local preachers, who went there for
   the purpose of bettering their worldly condition, at the same time
   carrying their religion with them. The author of Short Sketches of the
   Work of God in the Western Country, from whom much of this account is
   taken, relates, that about this time (1784) a local preacher by the
   name of Tucker, while on his way to that country in company with some
   of his friends and connections, who were removing with him to Kentucky,
   in descending the Ohio River in a boat, was attacked by some hostile
   Indians, and the preacher received a mortal wound, when he fell on his
   knees and died shouting praises to God. Before he fell, however, by his
   bravery and presence of mind he rescued the boat and his companions,
   among whom were several women and children, from destruction.

   This year Messrs. James Haw and Benjamin Ogden were sent to Kentucky;
   and though their labors were blessed in this new country to the souls
   of the people, they both soon after departed from the work, being
   seduced by James O'Kelly and his party.

   At the conference in Virginia a proposal was made for some preachers to
   volunteer their services for the state of Georgia, and several offered
   themselves for this new field of labor. Two of those who offered
   themselves, namely, Thomas Humphries and John Major, were accepted, and
   they went to their work in the name of the Lord, and were made a
   blessing to many. They formed a circuit along the settlements on the
   banks of the Savannah River, around by Little River, including the town
   of Washington. During the year they formed several societies,
   containing, upward of four hundred members -- so greatly did God bless
   their labors. Mr. Major continued in the state of Georgia about two
   years, where he ended his labors and life in great peace.

   Mr. Asbury, as the general superintendent, besides attending the
   conferences, which indeed was but a small part of his labor, traveled
   extensively through the bounds of the work, exposed often to many
   hardships and privations, but everywhere treated by the people of God
   as a messenger of peace and salvation. We find in his Journal for this
   year that he traversed the country from New York through the middle
   states to Virginia, and thence to North and South Carolina, preaching
   generally every day, and meeting the societies. While in Maryland, he
   received information that on Talbot circuit not less than five hundred
   souls had joined the Church, half of whom had professed justifying
   faith, and more than one hundred of the old professors gave evidence of
   enjoying "perfect love." Indeed, the work of God abundantly prospered
   this year in various parts of the country, so that the good effects of
   the late organization were generally felt and acknowledged, and in no
   department more than in the energy diffused through all its members by
   the general superintendency in the hands of such a man as Bishop
   Asbury. His influence was felt throughout the entire work.

   Two preachers had died, namely, --
    1. Jeremiah Lambert, who had been six years in the work, of whom it is
       said, that he was "a man of sound judgment good gifts, of genuine
       piety, and very useful" as a preacher, much esteemed in life and
       lamented in his death.
    2. James Thomas, a pious young man, of good gifts, useful and
       acceptable, blameless in his life, and much resigned in death.
       James Hinton, Edward Drumgole, William Glendenning, and William
       Ringold desisted from traveling.

   As the case of William Glendenning was somewhat singular, a few
   particulars respecting him may not be uninteresting. It seems that when
   a proposal was made for preachers to go to Nova Scotia, he was
   requested to volunteer in this service, to which, as he himself
   acknowledges, he objected with improper warmth, and thereby, as he
   supposed, grieved the Spirit, and soon fell into a state of mental
   darkness, and finally into an alienation of mind. On his being proposed
   for the elder's office, he was rejected, as he says, "because I wanted
   gifts." He then says, "While Mr. Asbury was at prayer, I felt all light
   of divine mercy, as in a moment, take its flight from me. My soul then
   sunk into the depths of misery and despair." After this he wandered
   about from place to place, until, in 1792, he wrote to the conference,
   requesting to be readmitted into the traveling ministry but his request
   was not granted, because it was believed that he labored under mental
   derangement.

   The numbers in society this year stood as follows: (white,) 18,791,
   (colored,) 1,890 -- total, 20,681: last year, 18,000 -- increase,
   2,681. Preachers this year, 117: last year, 104 -- increase, 13.

   It will be perceived from the above that a considerable number of
   colored persons had been received into the Church, and were so returned
   in the minutes of conference. Hence it appears that at an early period
   of the Methodist ministry in this country, it had turned its attention
   to this part of the population. Under the active labors of Dr. Coke,
   missions had already been established in the West Indies which promised
   much success, and 1,000 of the above number were in the Island of
   Antigua. These missions, however, were soon after taken under the care
   of the British conference, and have ever since been prosecuted by the
   Wesleyan Methodists with perseverance and success.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 2

    From 1787 to 1791 inclusive

   Three conferences were held this year; one in Salisbury, in North
   Carolina, on the 17th of March; another at Rough Creek Church, in
   Virginia, April 19th; and the third in Baltimore on the first day of
   May. Ten new circuits were added, namely, one in Georgia, the old
   circuit being divided, the two new ones being called Burke and Augusta:
   Cainhoy and Edisto, in South Carolina; Greenbrier, Bath, and Ohio, in
   Virginia; Clarksburgh, Nollechuckie, and Cumberland; and New Rochelle
   in New York.

   Dr. Coke arrived on the continent just in time to attend the first
   conference in North Carolina, whence he traveled extensively through
   different parts of the country, preaching to large congregations, and
   was very useful in his labors. It seems, however, that when he came to
   the conference in Baltimore, some dissatisfaction was manifested toward
   him, because, while in Europe, he had, as was contended, so far
   transcended his powers as to alter the time and place for the
   conference to meet after they had been fixed by the conference itself.
   This, with some other complaints of a trifling character, drew from Dr.
   Coke, with a view to allay all apprehensions of his American brethren
   hereafter, the following certificate: --

   The Certificate of Dr. Coke to the Conference.

   "I do solemnly engage by this instrument that I never will, by virtue
   of my office, as superintendent of the Methodist Church, during my
   absence from the United States of America, exercise any government
   whatever in said Methodist Church during my absence from the United
   States. And I do also engage, that I will exercise no privilege in the
   said Church when present in the United States, except that of ordaining
   according to the regulations and laws already existing or hereafter to
   be made in said Church, and that of presiding when present in
   conference, and lastly that of traveling at large. Given under my hand
   the second day of May in the year 1787.

   "Thomas Coke.

   "Witnesses: "John Tunnel, "John Hagerty, "Nelson Reed."

   And with a view to guard, as much as possible, against similar
   infringements of their rights in future, the following question and
   answer were entered on the minutes: --

   Question Who are the superintendents of our Church in these United
   States?

   "Answers Thomas Coke (when present in the States) and Francis Asbury."

   These things are recorded because they belong to the history of the
   times, and show the vigilance with which the conference watched over
   their rights. They show likewise the Christian spirit by which Dr. Coke
   was actuated in his intercourse with his American brethren; the respect
   he entertained for Bishop Asbury, his junior in office, in yielding to
   him, on account of his more intimate acquaintance with the preachers
   and people, the power of stationing the preachers; as well as his
   readiness to conciliate all by a frank acknowledgment of his error in
   the assumption of power which did not belong to him -- an act which was
   certainly more meritorious as it involved a greater sacrifice of
   feeling than that of the conference in passing a decree of oblivion for
   what had passed. Dr. Coke was, like all other men, too fallible not to
   err, and too good to persist in an error after being made sensible of
   it.

   At this conference it was proposed that Mr. Freeborn Garrettson be
   elected and ordained a superintendent for the societies in Nova Scotia
   and the West Indies. This was done in compliance with the express
   wishes of Mr. Wesley and Dr. Coke, as well as those of many of the
   preachers in Nova Scotia. To this, however, Mr. Garrettson objected,
   until he might go and visit the brethren for one year, and then, if
   there should be a general wish for him to take the oversight of them in
   the character of a superintendent, he would comply. [16] With this
   proposition Dr. Coke expressed his satisfaction, and there the business
   ended; for, on account of some unexplained reason, Mr. Garrettson,
   contrary to his expectations, was appointed a presiding elder in the
   peninsula, on the eastern shore of Maryland.

   Mr. Wesley also signified his wish to have Mr. Richard Whatcoat
   ordained a joint superintendent with Bishop Asbury; but to this the
   conference objected, assigning, among other reasons, that they feared,
   should he be elected and consecrated, Mr. Wesley would call Bishop
   Asbury home; which shows the high estimation in which he was held by
   his brethren.

   This was the year in which the title of bishop, instead of
   superintendent, was used in the new edition of the Discipline, and has
   ever since been in use to designate that highest officer in the Church.
   Seeing that this change of name, perfectly innocent in itself, has
   given rise to so much controversy, by the fastidiousness of disaffected
   individuals, and those who have sought a pretext to impugn the motives
   of our first bishops and others, it were almost to be wished that it
   had never been taken. The fact, however, may have its use, as it has
   been the occasion of furnishing the friends of the Church with
   arguments in its defense, of which they might otherwise have never
   availed themselves.

   But as many specious objections have been preferred against our Church
   organization, arising partly from this circumstance, and partly from an
   opinion which has been expressed by malignant individuals, that
   fraudulent means were resorted to in order to effect it, I shall here
   state some of these objections, together with such answers as may be
   considered necessary to obviate them.
    1. As to the name itself, it is descriptive, when rightly understood,
       of the same official work as that of superintendent, the latter
       being derived from the Latin super and intendere, to oversee, and
       the former from the German, bishop, and both of the same
       signification with the Greek Episcopos, an overseer. The simple
       name, therefore, is perfectly harmless.
    2. It is objected that Mr. Wesley was opposed to the thing, and
       reproved Bishop Asbury for assuming the title of bishop. To the
       assumption of the title simply, I allow Mr. Wesley was opposed, but
       not to the thing signified by it; for,
         1. He ordained Dr. Coke to this very office; and,
         2. He sent him with a prayer-book prepared by himself, and with
            orders to consecrate Mr. Asbury to this office, with power to
            ordain others, and exercise functions which appertained not to
            a simple presbyter. [17]

   3.?A surreptitious taking of this title is not, in truth, chargeable
   upon either Dr. Coke or Bishop Asbury; for though they affixed it to
   their names in the edition of the Discipline without a formal vote of
   the conference, in 1786, Mr. Lee says, that at the ensuing conference,
   when the subject was submitted to them, a majority of them approved of
   the act, and it was accordingly inserted in the minutes for 1787, in
   the following words: --

   "We have constituted ourselves into an Episcopal Church, under the
   direction of bishops, elders, deacons, and preachers, according to the
   form of ordination annexed to our prayer-book, and the regulations laid
   down in this form of discipline." Hence we find in the minutes for 1788
   this question and answer: --

   Question Who are the bishops for our Church in the United States?

   "Answers Thomas Coke, Francis Asbury."

   Here, therefore, was an open avowal of the whole business in the
   official document of the Church, which all could read and understand.
   There was, therefore, neither secrecy, collusion, nor underhandedness
   of any sort in this transaction.

   The following questions and answers show the deep interest felt for the
   colored population, and for the rising generation: --

   Question 17. What directions shall we give for the promotion of the
   spiritual welfare of the colored people?

   Answers We conjure all our ministers and preachers by the love of God,
   and the salvation of souls, and do require them, by all the authority
   that is invested in us, to leave nothing undone for the spiritual
   benefit and salvation of them, within their respective circuits or
   districts; and for this purpose to embrace every opportunity of
   inquiring into the state of their souls, and to unite in society those
   who appear to have a real desire of fleeing from the wrath to come, to
   meet such in class, and to exercise the whole Methodist discipline
   among them.

   Question 19. Shall any directions be given concerning the
   register-books?

   Answers Let register-books be provided by all the societies that the
   elders and deacons may enter the marriages and baptisms regularly in
   them; and let every such register book be kept in the hands of the
   steward or any other proper person of each society respectively. Let
   one general register-book be also kept in the hands of the general
   steward of every circuit, in which the contents of all the private
   register-books in the circuit may be inserted at convenient times.

   Question 20. What can we do for the rising generation?

   Answers Let the elders, deacons, and helpers class the children of our
   friends in proper classes, as far as it is practicable, meet them as
   often as possible, and commit them, during their absence, to the care
   of proper persons, who may meet them at least weekly; and if any of
   them be truly awakened, let them be admitted into society.

   Hitherto there had been no conference held north of Philadelphia, and,
   since the commencement of the Revolutionary War, north of Baltimore;
   but this year we find Bishop Asbury, in pursuance of his grand design
   of spreading the gospel over these lands, in company with Dr. Coke,
   coming to New York, where he says "the doctor preached with great
   energy and acceptance." He then says, "I rode twenty miles on Long
   Island, to Hempstead harbor, and preached with some liberty in the
   evening. I am now out of the city, and have time to reflect: my soul
   returns to its rest, and to its labor for souls, in which I can live
   more by rule."

   This, indeed, seemed to be the element of his soul, to be in prayer, in
   which he was mighty, and in calling sinners to repentance; and having,
   as above related, visited this part of the country, he turned his face
   toward the south, traversing all the middle states, and everywhere
   sowing the "good seed of the kingdom." In Virginia he passed through
   the east end of the "Dismal Swamp," and thence into North Carolina,
   where he says, "I found we had to go twelve miles by water, and send
   the horses another way. O what a world of swamps, and rivers, and
   islands, we live in here!"

   This year was distinguished by a remarkable revival of religion,
   particularly in the southern parts of Virginia. As Mr. Lee has given a
   very particular account of this revival, the reader will be pleased to
   read it in his own words. It is as follows: --

   "There was a remarkable revival of religion in the town of Petersburgh,
   and many of the inhabitants were savingly converted; and the old
   Christians greatly revived. That town never witnessed before or since
   such wonderful displays of the presence and love of God in the
   salvation of immortal souls. Prayer meetings were frequently held both
   in the town and in the country, and souls were frequently converted at
   those meetings, even when there was no preacher present; for the
   prayers and exhortations of the members were greatly owned of the Lord.

   "The most remarkable work of all was in Sussex and Brunswick circuits,
   where the meetings would frequently continue five or six hours
   together, and sometimes all night.

   "At one quarterly meeting held at Mabry's Chapel in Brunswick circuit,
   on the 25th and 26th of July, the power of God was among the people in
   an extraordinary manner: some hundreds were awakened; and it was
   supposed that above one hundred souls were converted at that meeting,
   which continued for two days, i. e., on Thursday and Friday. Some
   thousands of people attended meeting at that place on that occasion.

   "The next quarterly meeting was held at Jones's Chapel, in Sussex
   county, on Saturday and Sunday, the 27th and 28th of July. This meeting
   was favored with more of the divine presence than any other that had
   been known before. The sight of the mourners was enough to penetrate
   the most careless heart. The divine power was felt among the people
   before the preachers came together. Many of the young converts from the
   quarterly meeting that had been held two days before at Mabry's, had
   come together, and uniting with other Christians in singing and
   praying, the heavenly fire began to kindle, and the flame of love and
   holy zeal was spreading among the people, which caused them to break
   out in loud praises to God. Some when they met would hang on each
   other, or embrace each other in their arms, and weep aloud, and praise
   the Lord with all their might. The sight of those who were thus
   overwhelmed with the love and presence of God, would cause sinners to
   weep and tremble before the Lord.

   "By the time the preachers came within half a mile of the chapel, they
   heard the people shouting and praising God. When they came up they
   found numbers weeping, both in the chapel and in the open air. Some
   were on the ground crying for mercy, and others in ecstasies of joy.

   "The preachers went among the mourners and encouraged them and prayed
   with them. The private Christians did the same. Some were lying and
   struggling as if they were in the agonies of death; others lay as if
   they were dead. Hundreds of the believers were so overcome with the
   power of God that they fell down, and lay helpless on the floor, or on
   the ground; and some of them continued in that helpless condition for a
   considerable time, and were happy in God beyond description. When they
   came to themselves, it was generally with loud praises to God, and with
   tears and expressions enough to melt the hardest heart. The oldest
   saints had never before seen such a time of love, and such displays of
   the power of God.

   "The next day the society met early, in order to receive the Lord's
   supper.

   "While the society was collected in the house, some of the preachers
   went into the woods to preach; and while they were preaching, the power
   of the Lord was felt among the people in such a manner that they roared
   and screamed so loud that the preacher could not be heard, and he was
   compelled to stop. Many scores of both white and black people fell to
   the earth; and some lay in the deepest distress until the evening. Many
   of the wealthy people, both men and women, were seen lying in the dust,
   sweating and rolling on the ground, in their fine broadcloths or silks,
   crying for mercy.

   As night drew on the mourners were collected together. and many of them
   were in the most awful distress, and uttered such doleful lamentations
   that it was frightful to behold them, and enough to affect the most
   stubborn-hearted sinner. But many of these were filled with the peace
   and love of God in a moment, and rising up, would clap their hands and
   praise God aloud. It was then as pleasing as it had before been awful
   to behold them.

   "Many of these people who were happily converted, left their houses and
   came to the meeting with great opposition to the work of God; but were
   struck down in an unexpected manner, and converted in a few hours. So
   mightily did the Lord work, that a great change was wrought in a little
   time.

   "Soon after this, some of the same preachers who had been at the
   quarterly meetings mentioned above, held a meeting at Mr. F. Bonner's,
   ten miles from Petersburgh, where a large concourse of people were
   assembled; and the Lord wrought wonders among them on that day. As many
   as fifty persons professed to get converted at that time before the
   meeting closed. The cries of distressed sinners under conviction, and
   the shouts of happy Christians, were heard afar off. Some that were
   careless spectators in the beginning of the meeting were happily
   converted before the meeting ended, and went home rejoicing in God,
   knowing that he had forgiven their sins.

   "They had another meeting at Jones' Hole Church, about twelve miles
   from Petersburgh; many people assembled. They began to sing and exhort
   each other before the preachers came, and the Lord wrought among them,
   and many were crying for mercy. The preacher began to preach, but it
   was with difficulty that he could keep the people quiet enough to hear
   him at all. The old Christians were all alive to God, and the young
   converts were so happy that they could not well hold their peace, but
   were ready to break out in loud praises to God. They kept in for a
   while; but toward the close of the sermon some of them broke out into
   strains of praise the flame spread immediately through the whole house,
   and hundreds were deeply affected. Some prayed as if they were going to
   take the kingdom by violence: others cried for mercy as if they were
   dropping into eternal misery; and some praised God with all their
   strength, till they dropped down helpless on the floor.

   The poor awakened sinners were wrestling with the Lord for mercy in
   every direction, some on their knees, others lying in the arms of their
   friends, and others stretched on the floor not able to stand, and some
   were convulsed, with every limb as stiff as a stick. In the midst of
   this work several sleepers of the house broke down at once, which made
   a very loud noise; and the floor sank down considerably; but the people
   paid but little or no attention to it, and many of them knew nothing of
   it, for no one was hurt. On that day many souls were brought into the
   liberty of God's children. Sinners were struck with amazement at seeing
   so many of their relations and neighbors converted, and few of them
   were left without some good desires to be converted themselves.

   "The great revival of religion in 1776, which spread extensively
   through the south part of Virginia, exceeded any thing of the kind that
   had ever been known before in that part of the country. But the revival
   this year far exceeded it.

   "It was thought that in the course of that summer there were as many as
   sixteen hundred souls converted in Sussex circuit; in Brunswick circuit
   about eighteen hundred; and in Amelia circuit about eight hundred. In
   these three circuits we had the greatest revival of religion but in
   many other circuits there was a gracious work, and hundreds were
   brought to God in the course of that year. To give a full description
   of that remarkable outpouring of the Spirit would exceed the bounds of
   this history. I have only given a short sketch of a few meetings. There
   were many other meetings not much inferior to those I have noticed. But
   the work was not confined to meetings for preaching; at prayer meetings
   the work prospered and many souls were born again; and the meetings
   often continued all night, without intermission. In class meetings the
   Lord frequently set the mourning souls at liberty. It was common to
   hear of souls being brought to God while at work in their houses or in
   their fields. It was often the case that the people in their
   corn-fields, white people, or black, and sometimes both together, would
   begin to sing, and being affected would begin to pray, and others would
   join with them, and they would continue their cries till some of them
   would find peace to their souls. Some account of this work was
   published in the newspapers at different times, and by that means
   spread all through the United States."

   John Robertson and James Foster located this year.

   Richard Owings had died. In the notice of his death, it is said that he
   was "one of the first local preachers on the continent." Before he
   entered the traveling ministry, which he did about two years before his
   death, he labored much in the back settlements; and, being a plain,
   honest, and good man, was very useful. He died at Leesburgh, Virginia,
   and no doubt rested from his labors.

   The success of this year's labor may be seen in the following account
   of the Numbers in the Church.

   Whites This Year, 21,949, Last Year, 18,791, Increase, 3,158; Colored
   This Year, 3,893, Last Year, 1,890, Increase, 1,003; Total This Year,
   25,842, Last Year, 20,681, Increase 5,161; Preachers This Year, 133,
   Last Year, 117, Increase 16. 1788.

   This year there were seven conferences, as follows: -- Charleston,
   South Carolina, March the 12th; Georgia, on the 9th of April; in
   Holstein, on the 19th of May; Amelia county, Virginia, on the 17th of
   June; in Uniontown, on the 22d of July; in Baltimore, on the 10th of
   September; in Philadelphia, on the 25th of September.

   By the division of some of the old circuits, and the addition of new
   ones, there were added to the list nineteen this year, making in all
   eighty-five; but as the names of the circuits were undergoing changes
   almost every year, and new ones added, it is thought not advisable to
   swell this history with every new name, noticing those only which were
   formed in new parts of the work. Two new circuits were added in North
   Carolina, called Seleuda and Waxsaws, and one in South Carolina, called
   Anson; French-Broad, and West River, in the back settlements, among the
   mountains of Virginia; Buckingham, Gloucester, and Rockingham, below
   the mountains. In Maryland, Annapolis, Harford, and Cecil were formed;
   Bristol and Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania; Dutchess, Shoreham, New City,
   Cambridge, and Lake Champlain, in New York conference.

   This year was also distinguished by very extensive revivals of
   religion, some of the most remarkable of which will be noticed. As may
   be seen by the preceding chapters, the Lord had raised up a number of
   zealous young men, who had entered the field of itinerancy with hearts
   fired and filled with love to God and the souls of men. Several of
   these were placed under the charge of Mr. Garrettson, who was requested
   by Bishop Asbury to penetrate the country north of the city of New
   York, and form as many circuits as he could.

   A great portion of this country was entirely destitute of religious
   instruction, more especially the northern and western parts of New York
   state, and the state of Vermont. There were, to be sure, some small
   scattered congregations of Lutherans, and Dutch Reformed, along the
   banks of the Hudson River, and some Congregationalists and Baptists in
   Vermont. It is manifest, however, that experimental and practical
   religion was at a very low ebb; and in most of the places, particularly
   in the new settlements on the west side of the Hudson River, where not
   even the forms of it were to be found. The following is Mr.
   Garrettson's own account of the manner in which he was led in this holy
   enterprise: --

   "I was very uneasy in my mind, being unacquainted with the country, an
   entire stranger to its inhabitants, there being no Methodist societies
   farther north than Westchester; but I gave myself to earnest prayer for
   direction. I knew that the Lord was with me. In the night season, in a
   dream, it seemed as if the whole country up the North River, as far as
   Lake Champlain, east and west was open to my view.

   "After conference adjourned, I requested the young men to meet me.
   Light seemed so reflected on my path that I gave them directions where
   to begin, and which way to form their circuits. I also appointed a time
   for each quarterly meeting, requested them to take up a collection in
   every place where they preached, and told them I should go up the North
   River to the extreme parts of the work, visiting the towns and cities
   in the way, and on my return, I should visit them all, and hold their
   quarterly meetings. I had no doubt but that the Lord would do wonders,
   for the young men were pious, zealous, and laborious."

   This plan, so wisely conceived, was carried into execution, and the
   result was as anticipated. Many houses and hearts were opened to these
   men of God; and although they suffered some persecution from those who
   understood not their character and motives, God wrought by their hands
   in a wonderful manner, so that in the minutes for the next year upward
   of six hundred were returned as members of the Church on those
   circuits.

   As an instance of the infatuation under which some persons labored
   respecting the character and objects of the Methodist preachers in that
   day, take the following, which is related on the authority of Mr.
   Garrettson: -- A gentleman from Vermont, on his way down the country,
   informed the people that these preachers were spread all over those
   parts through which he had come, and that some one had circulated a
   report, which many, it seems, believed, "that the king of England had
   sent them to disaffect the people toward their own government; and they
   doubted not but they would be instrumental of producing another war."
   Others, however, not quite as sagacious in political science, but
   better versed, as they thought, in theology, gave it, as their opinion,
   that these itinerants were a flying army of the false prophets spoken
   of by our Saviour, who should come in the last days, and deceive, if it
   were possible, the very elect! And then, again, the settled clergy were
   alarmed by an apprehension that they would break up their
   congregations, and thus deprive them of their "livings." These things,
   however, moved not those heralds of mercy from their steadfastness, nor
   turned them aside from their course.

   This year Bishop Asbury crossed the Allegheny Mountains; and as it will
   give the reader a correct perception of the manner in which he
   performed his duties in those days, and the privations to which he and
   his companions were often subjected, as well as the reflections of a
   pious and observant mind, I will give his own account of this journey.

   "Thursday 10. We had to cross the Allegheny Mountain again, at a bad
   passage. Our course lay over mountains and through valleys, and the mud
   and mire was such as might scarcely be expected in December. We came to
   an old forsaken habitation in Tygers' Valley: here our horses grazed
   about while we boiled our meat: midnight brought us up at Jones's,
   after riding forty, or perhaps fifty miles. The old man, our host, was
   kind enough to wake us up at four o'clock in the morning. We journeyed
   on through devious lonely wilds, where no food might he found, except
   what grew in the woods, or was carried with us. We met with two women
   who were going to see their friends, and to attend the quarterly
   meeting at Clarksburg. Near midnight we stopped at A____'s, who hissed
   his dogs at us: but the women were determined to get to quarterly
   meeting, so we went in. Our supper was tea. Brothers Phoebus and Cook
   took to the woods; old ____ gave up his bed to the women. I lay along
   the floor on a few deerskins with the fleas. That night our poor horses
   got no corn; and the next morning they had to swim across the
   Monongahela: after a twenty miles' ride we came to Clarksburg, and man
   and beast were so outdone that it took us ten hours to accomplish it. I
   lodged with Col. Jackson. Our meeting was held in a long close room
   belonging to the Baptists: our use of the house, it seems, gave
   offense. There attended about seven hundred people, to whom I preached
   with freedom; and I believe the Lord's power reached the hearts of
   some. After administering the sacrament, I was well satisfied to take
   my leave. We rode thirty miles to Father Haymond's, after three
   o'clock, Sunday afternoon, and made it nearly eleven before we came in;
   about midnight we went to rest, and rose at five o'clock next morning.
   My mind has been severely tried under the great fatigue endured both by
   myself and horse. O, how glad should I be of a plain, clean plank to
   lie on, as preferable to most of the beds; and where the beds are in a
   bad state, the floors are worse. The gnats are almost as troublesome
   here as the mosquitoes in the lowlands of the seaboard. This country
   will require much work to make it tolerable. The people are, many of
   them, of the boldest cast of adventurers, and with some the decencies
   of civilized society are scarcely regarded, two instances of which I
   myself witnessed. The great landholders who are industrious will soon
   show the effects of the aristocracy of wealth, by lording it over their
   poorer neighbors, and by securing to themselves all the offices of
   profit or honor: on the one hand savage warfare teaches them to be
   cruel; and on the other the preaching of Antinomians poisons them with
   error in doctrine: good moralists they are not, and good Christians
   they cannot be, unless they are better taught."

   What has God wrought in those western wilds since that period! The
   above is given as a specimen of the labors of that great and good man.
   His Journal shows that this year, as usual, he penetrated almost every
   part of the country, old and new -- the cities, towns, and villages,
   not neglecting the remote settlements of the woods; thus setting an
   example to the younger preachers, and to his successors in office, of
   the labors of a primitive evangelist. In all the conferences he
   presided jointly with Dr. Coke, when the latter was present; and then
   he was away, leading on "God's sacramental hosts" to the grand work of
   saving the souls for whom Christ had died.

   The eastern and western shores of Maryland were blessed this year with
   an outpouring of the Spirit, and many were brought to the knowledge of
   the truth. But the most remarkable revival of religion was in the city
   of Baltimore; and as this was somewhat peculiar in those days, in some
   of its characteristics, it may be well to give it a particular notice.

   In imitation of a practice adopted with so much success by Mr. Wesley,
   the preachers in and about Baltimore went into the fields and in the
   market-house on Howard's Hill, every Sabbath in the afternoon, after
   the service in the churches. By this means thousands were brought to
   hear the word of God, who otherwise, in all probability, would never
   have been reached by it. Through this instrumentality a number of
   persons had been awakened and converted before the session of the
   conference in September; and during the conference many more were
   brought from darkness to light.

   On the afternoon of Sabbath the 14th, Bishop Asbury preached in the
   church of the Rev. Mr. Otterbein, with whom he always maintained a
   Christian fellowship; and he remarks, "The Spirit of the Lord came
   among the people, and sinners cried aloud for mercy. Perhaps not less
   than twenty souls found the Lord from that time until Tuesday
   following." The work thus begun went on most rapidly, and in a short
   time there was such a noise among the people, particularly those who
   were smitten with conviction for sin, that many, even of the
   Christians, looked on with astonishment, having never seen things "on
   this wise;" while others, as if frightened at what they saw and heard,
   fled precipitately from the house, some making their escape through the
   windows. This strange scene soon drew multitudes to the church, "to see
   what these things meant," so that not only the house was filled, but
   many stood without in silent astonishment. In a short time some of
   those who were crying for mercy fell helpless upon the floor, or
   swooned away in the arms of their friends. But this scene soon changed.
   "Their mourning was turned to joy," and they arose "filled with all the
   fulness of God," and with joyful lips proclaimed his goodness to their
   souls. This had its happy effects upon the spectators, and the work
   continued to spread among the people, and several students in Cokesbury
   College were subjects of the revival. The consequence of this great
   work was, that about three hundred were added to the Church in the city
   of Baltimore.

   As this work commenced at the conference, many of the preachers
   received a new baptism of the Holy Spirit, and went to their several
   fields of labor "full of faith and the Holy Ghost," and God gave them
   many seals to their ministry.

   Enoch Matson, Adam Cloud, and Thomas S. Chew were entered on the
   minutes as having desisted from traveling, but they were in fact
   expelled for improper conduct. Their names were entered in this way
   probably from tenderness toward them and their friends.

   Caleb Boyer, Samuel Dudley, William Cannan, Joseph Wyatt, Michael
   Ellis, and Ignatius Pigman were returned as having a partial location
   on account of their families; but who, nevertheless, were subject to
   the order of the conference. The following had died since the last
   conference: --
    1. Thomas Curtis, of whom it is said that he was of "upright life,
       successful in his labors, and triumphant in his death." He had been
       seven years in the ministry.
    2. John Major, who was an honest, loving man, and who died as he
       lived, full of faith and the Holy Ghost. He was one of the first
       missionaries that went to the state of Georgia, and was frequently
       called, on account of the tenderness of his feelings, "The weeping
       prophet." He had been ten years in the ministry, and left behind
       him many witnesses to the blamelessness and usefulness of his life.
    3. Woolman Hickson. He is said to have been a young man of promising
       abilities as a preacher, of an upright life and blameless
       conversation; but after traveling seven years he was taken from his
       labors by the consumption, to his eternal reward. His last labors
       were chiefly in the vicinity of New York, and he finally died and
       was buried in that city.
    4. Elijah Ellis. An humble, diligent, and useful man, who, after
       laboring five years in the ministry, chiefly in Lancaster,
       Pennsylvania, died in peace.

   Numbers in the Church: White, This year, 30,809, Last year, 21,949;
   Increase, 8,860; Colored, This year, 6,545, Last year, 3,893; Increase,
   2,652; Total This year, 37,354, Total Last year, 25,842; Increase,
   11,512; Preachers, This year, 166, Last year, 133; Increase, 33.

   This large increase shows the blessed effects of the revivals before
   mentioned, and which exerted an extensive influence upon the
   surrounding population.

   1789. In consequence of the extension of the work in almost every
   direction, for the convenience of the preachers, and that the general
   superintendent might perform his work with greater facility and energy,
   there were eleven conferences this year, as follows: -- March 9th in
   Georgia; March 17th in Charleston, South Carolina; April 11th at
   McKnight's meeting house, on the Yadkin River, North Carolina; April
   18th at Petersburgh, Virginia; April 28th at Leesburgh, Virginia; May
   4th at Baltimore, Maryland; May 9th at Cokesbury, Maryland; May 13th at
   Chestertown; May 18th at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; May 23d at
   Trenton, New Jersey; May 28th in the city of New York. These
   conferences must have been very small, and it is stated that the having
   so many so near together gave dissatisfaction to many of the preachers,
   though it is manifestly impolitic for an annual conference to
   comprehend a very large territory.

   The following new circuits had been formed during the past year: --
   Bush River and Little Peedee, in South Carolina; Pamlico, in North
   Carolina; Greensville and Bottetourt, in Virginia; Baltimore City was
   this year separated from the circuit, and for the first time a preacher
   was stationed in the city; Wilmington and Milford, in Delaware;
   Burlington, in New Jersey; Newburgh, Columbia, Coeyman's Patent, and
   Schenectady, in New York; and Stamford, in Connecticut.

   At the conference of 1787, in consequence of its having been pleaded by
   Dr. Coke that the conference was under obligation to receive Mr.
   Whatcoat for a bishop, because it was the wish of Mr. Wesley, the
   minute which had been adopted in 1784 declaring that "during the
   lifetime of the Rev. John Wesley, we acknowledge ourselves his sons in
   the gospel, ready, in matters of church government, to obey his
   commands," was so far modified as to leave them at liberty to depart
   from his advice whenever they might think it incompatible with their
   rights and privileges as an independent Church. In justification of
   this proceeding it was said that the minute in question was a voluntary
   act of their own, and not a formal contract entered into with Mr.
   Wesley, and therefore without any violation of an agreement, they had a
   right to act in the premises as they thought proper; and more
   especially, as Mr. Wesley was in England, three thousand miles distant,
   he could not judge what was fit and right to be done here as well as
   those who were on the spot, and had actual knowledge of the state of
   things. On this account the resolution was rescinded in 1787, and a
   letter written to Mr. Wesley inviting him to come over and visit his
   American children, that he might more perfectly understand the state of
   things here from actual observation.

   These proceedings were not agreeable to Mr. Wesley, especially as they
   seemed to imply an abjuration of his authority, inasmuch as his name
   was not inserted in the minutes. With a view therefore to remove all
   unpleasantness from his mind, and to give assurance that they intended
   no disrespect to him, nor any renunciation of his general authority,
   the following question and answer were inserted in the minutes for this
   year: --

   "Question Who are the persons that exercise the episcopal office in the
   Methodist Episcopal Church in Europe and America?

   "Answers John Wesley, Thomas Coke, and Francis Asbury, by regular order
   and succession."

   There appears no little ambiguity in this question and answer. Did they
   mean to say that these persons exercised a joint superintendency both
   in Europe and America? Certainly not; for neither Thomas Coke nor
   Francis Asbury exercised any episcopal powers in Europe. What they
   meant to say evidently was this, that Thomas Coke and Francis Asbury
   acted in this country as joint superintendents over the Methodist
   Episcopal Church, while Mr. Wesley exercised a similar power singly in
   Europe, and a general superintendence in America. This is farther
   manifest from the next question and answer, which are in the following
   words: --

   "Question Who have been elected by the unanimous suffrages of the
   General Conference, to superintend the Methodist connection in America?

   "Answers Thomas Coke and Francis Asbury. [18]

   This year was, on several accounts, an important era in these United
   States. The old federal constitution had been found wanting in those
   principles which were essential for an efficient government, and was
   this year superseded by the adoption of that constitution under the
   operation of which the country has ever since so greatly prospered, and
   Gen. Washington had been unanimously elected the first president. It
   was therefore thought advisable by the Methodist conference which sat
   in the city of New York at the time that the first congress assembled
   in the same city under the new constitution, for Bishops Coke and
   Asbury to present a congratulatory address to him as the public organ
   and head of the government. This was accordingly done. And as the
   author of a pamphlet quaintly called the "History and Mystery of
   Methodist Episcopacy," has seen fit to arraign the authors of this
   address before the public, and even to impeach their integrity, it is
   thought to be a duty which we owe to the venerable men who signed the
   address, as well as to the interests of truth, to set this matter in a
   fair point of light.

   The author above mentioned affirmed that the true date of the address
   was 1785; [19] but as it was published under date of May 29, 1789, he
   inferred that for some sinister purpose, Bishops Coke and Asbury had
   altered the date, and thereby practiced a deception upon the public.
   This subject was fully investigated by the late Bishop Emory in his
   "Defence of our Fathers," and all the insinuations and false assertions
   of the above writer fully exposed and refuted. The following letter
   from the Rev. Thomas Morrell, who has recently gone to his reward, to
   the Rev. Ezekiel Cooper, dated Elizabethtown, N. J., August 26, 1827,
   will throw much light on this subject: --

   "With regard to the information you request concerning the address to
   General Washington, I can furnish you with every material circumstance
   respecting it, having acted as a sub-agent in the transaction, and
   having a distinct recollection of the whole business. The history of it
   is, That Mr. Asbury, in the New York conference in 1789, offered for
   the consideration of the conference the following proposal: -- Whether
   it would not be proper for us, as a church, to present a congratulatory
   address to General Washington, who had been lately inaugurated
   president of the United States, in which should he embodied our
   approbation of the constitution, and professing our allegiance to the
   government. The conference unanimously approved, and warmly recommended
   the measure; and appointed the two bishops, Dr. Coke and Mr. Asbury, to
   draw up the address. It was finished that day, and read to the
   conference, who evinced great satisfaction in its recital. Brother
   Dickens and myself were delegated to wait on the president with a copy
   of the address, and request him to appoint a day and hour when he would
   receive the bishops, one of whom was to read it to him, and receive his
   answer. It was concluded that although Dr. Coke was the senior bishop,
   yet not being an American citizen, there would be an impropriety in his
   presenting and reading the address; the duty devolved of course on
   Bishop Asbury. Mr. Dickens and myself waited on the general; and as I
   had some personal acquaintance with him, I was desired to present him
   with the copy, and request his reception of the original by the hands
   of the bishops. The president appointed the fourth succeeding day, at
   twelve o'clock, to receive the bishops. They went at the appointed
   hour, accompanied by Brother Dickens and Thomas Morrell. Mr. Asbury,
   with great self-possession, read the address in an impressive manner.
   The president read his reply with fluency and animation. They
   interchanged their respective addresses; and, after sitting a few
   minutes, we departed. The address and the answer, in a few days, were
   inserted in the public prints; and some of the ministers and members of
   the other churches appeared dissatisfied that the Methodists should
   take the lead. In a few days the other denominations successively
   followed our example.

   "The next week a number of questions were published, in the public
   papers, concerning Dr. Coke's signing the address. Who was he? How came
   he to be a bishop? Who consecrated him? &c., accompanied with several
   strictures on the impropriety of a British subject signing an address
   approving of the government of the United States; charging him with
   duplicity, and that he was an enemy to the independence of America; for
   they affirmed he had written, during our Revolutionary War, an
   inflammatory address to the people of Great Britain, condemning, in
   bitter language, our efforts to obtain our independence and other
   charges tending to depreciate the doctor's character, and bringing him
   into contempt with the people of our country. As I did not believe the
   assertion of the doctor's writing the address above mentioned, I
   applied to a gentleman who was in England at the time, to know the
   truth of the charge; he assured me the doctor had published no such
   sentiments in England during the Revolutionary War, or at any other
   period, or he should have certainly had some knowledge of it. And this
   was the fact; for the doctor had written no such thing. As there was no
   other person in New York, at that time, in our connection, who could
   meet these charges, and satisfactorily answer these queries, I
   undertook the task, and in my weak manner endeavored to rebut the
   charges and answer the questions. A second piece appeared, and a second
   answer was promptly published. No more was written on the subject in
   New York. The doctor afterward gave me his thanks for defending his
   character.

   "Such are the material circumstances that occurred concerning the
   address to General Washington, and his reply: which you are at liberty
   to make use of in any way you think proper, -- and if you judge it
   necessary may put my name to it. Thomas Morrell.'"

   "I certify that the above is a true extract of an original letter of
   the Rev. Thomas Morrell, addressed to me, bearing the above date, and
   now in my possession.

   "Ezekiel Cooper. New York, September 7, 1827.'"

   "To this we add the following copy of a letter from the Rev. Mr.
   Sparks, of Boston, to whom the papers of General Washington have been
   intrusted, for the purpose of making such selections for publication as
   he shall deem proper; in which important work this gentleman is now
   engaged. And for this polite and prompt reply to our inquiries, we here
   tender to Mr. Sparks our most respectful thanks.

   "Boston, September 1, 1827.

   "Dear Sir, -- Your favor of the 26th ultimo has been received, and I am
   happy to be able to furnish you with the information you desire. The
   "date" of the address presented by Bishops Coke and Asbury to General
   Washington is May twenty-ninth, 1789. It is proper to inform you,
   however, that I do not find the original paper on the files, but take
   the date as it is recorded in one of the volumes of "Addresses." It is
   barely possible that there may be a mistake in the record, but not at
   all probable.

   "It is not likely that any address from any quarter was presented to
   Washington in 1785. I have never seen any of that year. He was then a
   private man, wholly employed with his farms.

   "I am, sir, very respectfully, "Your obedient servant,

   "Jared Sparks.

   "Mr. J. Emory.'"

   That the reader may have all the information desirable in reference to
   this subject, I have copied the address itself from the Gazette of the
   United States for June 6, 1789, a file of which is preserved in the New
   York City Library. [20] It is as follows: --

  ADDRESS OF THE BISHOPS OF THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH.

   "To the President of the United States: --

   "Sir, -- We, the bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church, humbly beg
   leave, in the name of our society, collectively, in these United
   States, to express to you the warm feelings of our hearts, and our
   sincere congratulations on your appointment to the presidentship of
   these States. We are conscious, from the signal proofs you have already
   given, that you are a friend of mankind; and under this established
   idea, place as full confidence in your wisdom and integrity for the
   preservation of those civil and religious liberties which have been
   transmitted to us by the providence of God and the glorious revolution,
   as we believe ought to be reposed in man.

   "We have received the most grateful satisfaction from the humble and
   entire dependence on the great Governor of the universe which you have
   repeatedly expressed, acknowledging him the source of every blessing,
   and particularly of the most excellent constitution of these States,
   which is at present the admiration of the world, and may in future
   become its great exemplar for imitation; and hence we enjoy a holy
   expectation, that you will always prove a faithful and impartial patron
   of genuine, vital religion, the grand end of our creation and present
   probationary existence. And we promise you our fervent prayers to the
   throne of grace, that God Almighty may endue you with all the graces
   and gifts of his Holy Spirit, that he may enable you to fill up your
   important station to his glory, the good of his Church, the happiness
   and prosperity of the United States, and the welfare of mankind.

   "Signed in behalf of the Methodist Episcopal Church.

   "Thomas Coke,

   "Francis Asbury.

   "New York, May 29, 1789.'"

   The following is the reply of President Washington: --

   To the Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States
   of America.

   "Gentlemen, -- I return to you individually, and through you to your
   society collectively in the United States, my thanks for the
   demonstrations of affection, and the expressions of joy offered in
   their behalf, on my late appointment. It shall be my endeavor to
   manifest the purity of my inclinations for promoting the happiness of
   mankind, as well as the sincerity of my desires to contribute whatever
   may be in my power toward the civil and religious liberties of the
   American people. In pursuing this line of conduct, I hope, by the
   assistance of divine Providence, not altogether to disappoint the
   confidence which you have been pleased to repose in me.

   "It always affords me satisfaction when I find a concurrence of
   sentiment and practice between all conscientious men, in
   acknowledgments of homage to the great Governor of the universe, and in
   professions of support to a just civil government. After mentioning
   that I trust the people of every denomination, who demean themselves as
   good citizens, will have occasion to be convinced that I shall always
   strive to prove a faithful and impartial patron of genuine vital
   religion -- I must assure you in particular, that I take in the kindest
   part the promise you make of presenting your prayers at the throne of
   grace for me, and that I likewise implore the divine benediction on
   yourselves and your religious community.

   "George Washington.'"

   Though the fact that Dr. Coke signed the above address to Washington
   exposed him to some keen censure from some of his friends in England,
   because they contended that it was incompatible with his duty as a
   subject of the British empire thus to eulogize the American
   constitution and the president of the republic, yet the act itself
   originated from the sincerest sentiments of veneration for the
   excellent Washington; and the spirit which the address breathes is
   evidence of the most genuine piety and patriotism. And whatever may be
   said for or against Dr. Coke on account of the double relation he held
   to the two bodies of Methodists in England and America, no whisper
   could be breathed against the propriety of Bishop Asbury's conduct in
   this affair, as he had become an American citizen, was cordially
   attached to the constitution and government of his adopted country, was
   seeking to promote its best interests, and regarded the newly elected
   president with ardent affection and profound veneration. Nor were the
   expressions of devotedness to the government and its president less the
   sentiments of the conference, and the Methodist people generally, than
   they were of the venerable men who signed it. The high estimation in
   which Bishop Asbury held Washington may be seen from the following
   remarks which he made on hearing of the death of that great man. He was
   then at Charleston, South Carolina, and had just adjourned a conference
   which had been held in that city, January 1800. He says, --

   "Slow moved the northern post on the eve of new year's day, and brought
   the distressing information of the death of Washington, who departed
   this life December 14, 1799.

   "Washington, the calm, intrepid chief, the disinterested friend, first
   father, and temporal saviour of his country under divine protection and
   direction. A universal cloud sat upon the faces of the citizens of
   Charleston -- the pulpits clothed in black -- the bells muffled -- the
   paraded soldiery -- the public oration decreed to be delivered on
   Friday the 14th of this month -- a marble statue to be placed in some
   proper situation, -- these were the expressions of sorrow, and these
   the marks of respect paid by his fellow-citizens to this great man. I
   am disposed to lose sight of all but Washington. Matchless man! At all
   times he acknowledged the providence of God, and never was he ashamed
   of his Redeemer. We believe he died not fearing death. In his will he
   ordered the manumission of his slaves -- a true son of liberty in all
   points."

   I have made this quotation, the sentiments of which seem to have been
   the spontaneous effusion of the writer's heart in respect to this
   universally beloved and respected man, for the purpose of showing that
   the above address was not intended as an unmeaning compliment, merely
   to court the popular favor by a servile fawning at the feet of a great
   man; but that it contained the genuine feelings of the heart, and was
   intended as a tribute of gratitude to God for favoring the American
   people with such a noble monument of his wisdom and goodness in the
   person of this illustrious chief, and in that admirable constitution
   which his hands helped to frame, and which he was now called upon, by
   the unanimous suffrages of a free people, to administer and carry into
   practical effect.

   It was indeed but natural for those who had suffered so many privations
   through a bloody and protracted war, and had since contended with many
   sorts of opposition from malignant foes, and not a little low
   scurrility from the exclusive spirit of sectarian bigotry, to rejoice
   in beholding the adoption of a constitution which guarantied to all
   denominations their rights and privileges equally, and to see this
   constitution committed to the hands of men who had ever manifested an
   impartial regard for each religious sect, and for the inalienable
   rights of all mankind.

   As this year was the beginning of Methodism in New England, perhaps it
   may be proper to give some account of the state of that part of our
   country, that the reader may duly appreciate the difficulties with
   which it had to contend.

   It has already been seen in the introduction that Congregationalism was
   the prevalent system of Christianity established in this portion of the
   country. As the early settlers fled here on account of the persecutions
   which they endured at home, and built themselves up in a separate
   community, their religious and civil regulations were interwoven, so
   that they were made mutually to support each other. Thus churches were
   built, ministers settled and supported, schools and colleges
   established according to law; and a tax was laid upon the people, in
   proportion to their property, to sustain these things in conjunction
   with their civil institutions. In thus providing by law for their own
   support, they took care to guard against the introduction of other
   sects, as far as they consistently could, simply tolerating them in
   holding their meetings, while they were abridged of many of their
   rights. According to these regulations all were born members of the
   Congregation Church, and, when grown maturity, were obliged to pay
   their proportion toward its support, unless they lodged a certificate
   in the office of the town clerk that they had attached themselves to
   some other society.

   But the Ideological creed of the country differed in some important
   particulars from that of the Methodists. I need barely say that the
   Congregationalists of New England were Calvinist: of the highest order,
   and, at that time, excessively rigid in their opposition to Arminian or
   Methodistical doctrines, professing to esteem them as heretical, and
   dangerous to the souls of the people. And, moreover, as there were very
   generally ministers established in every parish -- for the whole
   country was divided into parishes -- they considered it an encroachment
   upon their rights for a stranger to intermeddle with them. This was the
   general state of things in New England. Professing a system of religion
   which had been handed down to them from their Puritan fathers, guarded
   and supported by their laws, and defended too in the pulpit by men in
   general well educated, they wanted not motives to resist the intrusions
   of Methodist itinerants, who could boast little from their human
   learning and science, though they certainly stood high for their piety,
   and were by no means inferior to their fellows in their knowledge of
   divine things.

   But with all these advantages -- and surely they were not few -- "pure
   religion" was not generally pressed upon the people from the pulpit.
   Among the Baptists, some congregations of whom were found scattered
   through the country, experimental religion was enforced, and no doubt
   enjoyed by many. But generally speaking, I believe it may be said that,
   at the time of which we are now speaking, experimental and practical
   religion was at a very low ebb throughout the churches of New England
   and in some portions of the country, particularly in Massachusetts, the
   Unitarian heresy was beginning to show itself in some of the
   congregations, more especially in and about the city of Boston. This
   destructive heresy has since spread itself extensively in
   Massachusetts, has taken possession of Cambridge College, and infected
   most of the churches in Boston and its vicinity.

   This was the general state of things when the Rev. Jesse Lee entered
   this field of labor. [21] It was on the 17th of June, 1789, that he
   preached the first Methodist sermon ever delivered in the state of
   Connecticut, in the town of Norwalk. Such was the state of feeling in
   that country that no house could. be procured for preaching, all being
   afraid to open their houses to the stranger. Mr. Lee, therefore, who
   was not to be intimidated by such discouragements, went into the
   street, began to sing, and then to pray; and this being heard by a few,
   a tolerable congregation soon collected, to whom he preached, no one
   interrupting him. On the 21st of June he preached for the first time in
   the city of New Haven. He proceeded in his work until he formed a
   regular circuit, including the towns of Norwalk, Fairfield, Stratford,
   Milford, Redding, Danbury, and Canaan, with several, intermediate
   places. The manner of his preaching, without notes, the fervency of his
   spirit, as well as the doctrines he delivered, so opposite to the
   Calvinism which they had been accustomed to hear, excited much
   curiosity and drew multitudes to hear him; and some, he says, were
   brought to feel the weight of the truths he uttered. But they were by
   no means mere passive hearers. Priests and people, men, women, and
   children, from their education and habits of life, were fond of
   disputation, and often, after the preaching, would enter into
   controversy with the preacher, and especially upon those points on
   which he differed from the prevalent doctrines of the day. Their
   objections, however, were generally founded upon the erroneous
   representations, drawn by themselves as an inference from what they had
   heard, that the Methodists held to salvation by the merit of good
   works. This they inferred from the denial of the doctrine of
   irresistible grace, unconditional and personal election and
   reprobation, and not because that dogma had ever been asserted; for no
   such doctrine had ever been held or promulgated by Mr. Wesley or any of
   his preachers. Mr. Lee, however, endeavored to avoid, as much as
   possible, all thriftless controversy, by striving to direct their
   attention to the more important inquiry, whether they had ever been
   "born of the Spirit," and whether, as a consequence, they now enjoyed
   "peace with God through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ." The silent
   manner in which these questions were listened to, showed evidently that
   the disputants were more anxious about "lesser matters," than they were
   concerning "the things which accompany salvation."

   The first Methodist society which was formed in Connecticut was in
   Stratford, which was on the 26th day of September, and consisted of
   only three females; but this was a nucleus around which others gathered
   after much labor and toil, and which has since become a large and
   flourishing society. The next class was formed in the town of Redding,
   consisting of a male and female; the former, Aaron Sandford, became a
   local preacher, and continues such to this day, having lived to see his
   children, and many of his grand children, members of the Church, with a
   large and influential society gathered around him; he has a son and a
   son-in-law in the ministry, and I believe one grand son.

   The first Methodist church ever built in New England was on this
   (Stratford) circuit, in the town of Weston. It was called, in honor of
   the first Methodist preacher who penetrated into that part of the
   country, Lee's Chapel. It stood until the year 1813, when it was
   rebuilt; and the writer of this [Nathan Bangs] preached the dedication
   sermon in the new house, on "The glory of this latter house shall be
   greater than the former, saith the Lord of hosts: and in this place
   will I give peace, saith the Lord of hosts," Hag. ii, 9.

   In the month of February, 1790, three preachers, Jacob Brush, George
   Roberts, and Daniel Smith, were sent by Bishop Asbury to the help of
   Mr. Lee. They met him in Dantown, where he was holding a quarterly
   meeting in a house of worship not yet finished -- which was the second
   built in the country. The coming of these brethren was a great comfort
   to Mr. Lee, and they strengthened each other's hands in the Lord.
   During the preaching on Sabbath, the power of the Lord was so
   manifested that many cried aloud for mercy, a thing so unusual in that
   part of the country that some were very much alarmed, and fled from the
   house in consternation, and others who were in the gallery jumped out
   on the ground. In the midst, however, of the confusion occasioned by
   these movements, those who had an experience of divine things rejoiced
   with exceeding great joy.

   Notwithstanding the exterior respect which was paid to religion in this
   "land of steady habits," the coming of the Methodist preachers excited
   no little opposition. They were generally called by the settled clergy,
   "wolves in sheep's clothing," the "false prophets who should come in
   the latter day," &c., and hence the people felt themselves at liberty
   to ridicule and persecute them in a variety of ways. As many in the
   pulpit harangued their people in opposition to those "itinerating
   peddlers of a false doctrine," as they were sometimes called in
   derision, the people caught the spirit, and echoed back upon them the
   opprobrious epithet, mingling with their jeers such unruly conduct as
   often disturbed them in their solemn assemblies. Hence they have been
   known to roll stones into the houses where they were assembled in the
   time of worship, and otherwise interrupt their devotions. These things,
   however, disheartened not these messengers of mercy in their work, nor
   impeded their progress in their endeavors to evangelize the people.

   The writer of this [Nathan Bangs] remembers perfectly well, when but a
   boy, of hearing the remarks which were made by some of the people on
   returning one evening from hearing a Methodist preacher. The wonder was
   whence they came! They finally concluded, as they had come up from the
   south, that they were a set of broken merchants, who, having become
   poor, and being too lazy to work, had taken to this method of preaching
   to procure a livelihood. I have mentioned this circumstance to show the
   ignorance which prevailed among the people generally in respect to the
   character and objects of those primitive Methodist preachers, and as an
   apology for the treatment they met with from the thoughtless and the
   gay. Good impressions, however, were made upon many minds, and Bishop
   Asbury, speaking of the commencement of his work, says, "New England
   stretcheth out the hand to our ministry, and I trust shortly will feel
   its influence. My soul shall praise the Lord."

   The revival noticed as having begun last year in Baltimore and in some
   parts of Maryland, went forward with great rapidity this year; and in
   Baltimore more particularly, Mr. Lee says it exceeded any thing which
   had been witnessed before. Such was the power which attended the word
   preached that some of the greatest revilers of the work were
   constrained to bow to its influence, and to confess that God was indeed
   is the midst of his people. The following is his own account of this
   work: --

   "Some, were two, three, or four hours on their knees; others were
   prostrate on the floor, most earnestly agonizing for mercy, till they
   could rejoice in God their Saviour! "What power! what awe rested on the
   people!

   "Some, after they went home, could not sleep, but wept and prayed all
   night. The next day was such a time as cannot be sufficiently
   described.

   "Early in the morning, a preacher was sent for to visit a young woman
   who was under conviction. He exhorted her to believe in the Lord Jesus,
   and then sung and prayed with her.

   "A considerable number of the members of society were collected to
   supplicate the throne of grace in her behalf. At last the Lord suddenly
   shed abroad his love in her heart, so that she lifted up her voice with
   others in loud praises to God.

   "This was only a small part of that day's work. About ten in the
   morning, a company of mourners assembled together at a private house,
   where the work of conversion began. First one, and then another,
   entered into the liberty of the children of God. The news spread; the
   people collected till the house and street were filled with a crowd of
   believers, and a wondering multitude: and this continued without
   intermission till night. They then repaired to the church, which was
   presently filled, and they continued there until two o'clock the next
   morning before they broke up.

   "Some who came there quite careless, and indeed making derision of the
   whole, were converted before they returned. Many hard-hearted opposers
   were conquered at last, and earnestly sought salvation.

   "At the same time the country circuits throughout Maryland seemed to
   flame with holy love. On the eastern shore there was a powerful work;
   hundreds in different parts were turning to God."

   Dr. Coke arrived again on the continent this year, and after attending
   some of the conferences, traveled extensively through different parts
   of the country, and was made a blessing to many. Speaking of the
   conference which assembled in North Carolina, Bishop Asbury says, "We
   opened our conference, and were blessed with peace and union; our
   brethren from the west met us, and we had weighty matters for
   consideration before us."

   But the glorious work which was breaking forth in every direction was
   much aided by the energetic labors of Bishop Asbury, who traversed
   almost every part of the continent, preaching and setting things in
   order. This year he followed in the track which had been marked out by
   Mr. Garrettson the preceding year, up the North River, through Dutchess
   county, surveying the length and breadth of the land, and in the midst
   of all his labors and bodily sufferings he exclaims, "My soul is so
   filled with God, that it appears as if all sense of pain was suspended
   by the power of faith." Thence he went south, through New Jersey,
   Pennsylvania, and Maryland, and witnessed the glorious revival which
   was going on in Baltimore. Under date of September 8, 1789, he says, --

   "I preached in town and at the Point. The last quarterly meeting was a
   wonder-working time. Fifty or sixty souls were then and there brought
   to God. People were daily praying to God from house to house; some
   crying for mercy, others rejoicing in God, and not a few, day after
   day, joining in society for the benefit of Christian fellowship. Praise
   the Lord, O my soul! I spent some time in visiting from house to house,
   and in begging for the college. The married men and the single men, the
   married women and single women, I met apart, and was comforted. Many of
   the children of the Methodists are the happy subjects of this glorious
   revival. We have more members in Baltimore (town and Point) than in any
   city or town on the continent besides."

   He did not, however, remain long pent up in the city, for under date of
   the 28th of this month we find him at Bush Forest Chapel, in the
   neighborhood of Abingdon, where he makes the following remarks "This
   was one of the first houses that were built for the Methodists in the
   state of Maryland, and one of the first societies was formed here. They
   had been dead for many years; -- of late the Lord has visited the
   neighborhood, and I suppose, from report, fifty souls have been
   converted to God."

   The work of God also extended in many places within the bounds of the
   new district formed last year by Mr. Garrettson. Mr. Philip Embury,
   [22] who had been instrumental in founding the little society in the
   city of New York, after the arrival of the regular preachers in that
   city, moved to Ashgrove, and collected a small society in that place,
   chiefly of emigrants from Ireland. Before the time of which we now
   speak, they had made several attempts to obtain the aid of traveling
   preachers, but did not succeed until 1788, when, in answer to a
   petition to the conference, Mr. Garrettson sent Mr. Lemuel Green to
   their help. He brought the society under disciplinary regulations, and
   likewise extended his labors with good effect into the adjoining
   settlements. Thus this society at Ashgrove may be considered as the
   center of Methodism in all that region of country.

   Long Island also, in the state of New York, was more particularly
   provided for this year. We have already seen that Captain Webb visited
   some towns on this island, as early as 1768, and many sinners were
   awakened under his powerful appeals to their consciences. The political
   troubles, however, which arose out of the War of the Revolution, had a
   most deleterious effect upon the religion and morals of the Long
   Islanders. The British army had the island in possession for several
   years, and many were the skirmishes, after the memorable battle upon
   Brooklyn heights, between the contending forces; and the people were
   perpetually harassed with the depredations committed upon their
   property by both of the belligerents. On the return of peace, however,
   the people began to long for the ordinances of religion, and as early
   as 1784 Mr. Philip Cox was stationed on Long Island; he found a number
   who remembered the preaching of Captain Webb. He was succeeded by the
   Rev. Ezekiel Cooper, whose faithful and able ministry was made a
   blessing to many. Messrs. Thomas Ware, Peter Moriarty, and Robert Cloud
   followed Mr. Cooper, and their evangelical efforts were crowned with
   success. This year, 1789, Messr,. William Phoebus and John Lee were
   stationed here, and Long Island formed a part of the New York district.

   Long Island has become somewhat famous as being the birthplace of Elias
   Hicks, the celebrated Quaker preacher, whose peculiar notions in
   religion, and his zealous manner of propagating them, have been a means
   of dividing that peaceable denomination, and, it is to be feared, of
   poisoning the minds of many with very erroneous views of Christianity.
   These notions, coming so directly in contact with some of the
   fundamental principles of Methodism, particularly as respects the deity
   and atonement of Christ, and the ordinances of baptism and the Lord's
   supper, were no small impediments in the way of those Methodist
   preachers who first labored here. The Lord of the harvest, however, was
   with them, and gave them access to the understandings and consciences
   of the people, so that at this time there were upward of two hundred
   members in the several societies on Long Island.

   That God exercises a particular providence over his people, and grants
   to them blessings in answer to their prayers, is abundantly attested in
   the holy Scriptures, as well as by the experience and testimony of his
   servants, in all ages of his church. Those who affect to question this
   doctrine if they profess faith in divine revelation, would do well to
   remember that they thereby impeach the veracity of the divine promises,
   and render ineffectual even the fervent prayers of the righteous. God
   has said, "Ask, and be given" He also declares that "his ears are open
   and attentive to the prayers of the righteous." And will he not fulfil
   his promise to those who pray in faith? He certainly will -- else his
   promise is vain, and prayer is useless.

   The following narrative respecting the introduction of Methodism into
   Southold, Long Island, strikingly illustrates the truth of the above
   remarks, and evinces that the good hand of the Lord is ever with his
   people. It Is related on the best authority: --

   In 1794, a Mrs. Moore, who had been converted by the instrumentality of
   the Methodists, removed to Southold. Being destitute of a spiritual
   ministry, she united with two other females of a like spirit with
   herself every Monday evening in holding a prayer meeting, in which they
   prayed especially that God would send them a faithful minister. Twice
   they met at the house of a Mr. Vail, who, though not a professor of
   religion, was willing that the meeting should be held in his house, as
   his wife was one of the three, engaged in this pious work. A
   circumstance occurring one evening which caused them to omit their
   social meeting, each one retired to her own house, determined to pour
   out the desire of their souls to God that the primary object of their
   prayers, namely, the gift of a faithful preacher, might be granted
   them. During the exercises of this evening they felt an unusual spirit
   of prayer; but more particularly Mrs. Moore, who continued in strong
   prayer until near midnight, when she received an assurance that God had
   heard them, by the following word being deeply impressed upon her mind:
   -- "I have heard their cry, and am come down to deliver them:" and so
   strong was the conviction upon her mind that she praised God for what
   she believed he would most assuredly do.

   At this very time, Wilson Lee, one of the early Methodist preachers,
   was at New London, Connecticut, and had put his trunk on board of a
   vessel with a view to go to his appointment in New York: Contrary wind
   prevented his departure on the same night in which these pious females
   were praying in their separate apartments on Long Island, for God to
   send them a "shepherd after his own heart," this man of God, detained
   by contrary winds in New London, felt an unusual struggle of mind for
   the salvation of souls, attended with a vivid and powerful impression
   that it was his duty to cross the Sound and go to Long Island.
   Powerful, indeed, was this impression, that though he tried to resist
   it, he at length resolved that if a way opened he would proceed. On
   going to the wharf next morning, he found, to his surprise, a sloop
   ready to sail for Southold, and without farther hesitancy he
   immediately embarked and on landing, in answer to his inquiries, was
   conducted to the house of Mrs. Moore. On seeing him approach the house,
   and recognizing him from his appearance for a Methodist preacher,
   though a total stranger, she ran to the door, and saluted him in the
   following words: -- "Thou blessed of the Lord, come in!" They mutually
   explained the circumstances above narrated, and rejoiced together, "for
   the consolation." A congregation was soon collected, to whom Mr. Lee
   preached with lively satisfaction. God blessed his labors -- a class
   was formed, and from that, period the Methodists continued, with
   various degrees of prosperity, in Southold, and gradually spread
   through the length and breadth of the island.

   Having thus noticed the progress of the work of religion in different
   parts of the country, let us return to the doings of the conference. In
   consequence of the extension of the work on every hand, spreading over
   such a large territory, there were two difficulties which arose in the
   way of proceeding in the manner they had done heretofore.
    1. It was very inconvenient for all the members of the conference to
       assemble together in one place to transact their business. Hence,
       as we have already seen, the bishops had appointed several separate
       conferences for the dispatch of their ordinary affairs.
    2. But any thing which was done in these separate conferences was not
       binding, except simply the ordinations and stationing the
       preachers, unless sanctioned by them all. And as this could rarely
       be expected, constituted as human nature is, it was plainly seen
       that there was danger of their falling to pieces, or of having
       divers administrations. To provide against this evil, and to remedy
       the inconvenience above mentioned, it was determined this year, as
       the best thing which could be devised, to have a council, for the
       reasons and purposes, and with the powers set forth in the
       following questions and answers: --

   Question Whereas the holding of general conferences on this extensive
   continent would be attended with a variety of difficulties, and many
   inconveniences to the work of God; and whereas we judge it expedient
   that a council should be formed of chosen men out of the several
   districts as representatives of the whole connection, to meet at stated
   times; in what manner is this council to be formed, what shall be its
   powers, and what farther regulations shall be made concerning it?

   "Answers

   1st. Our bishops and presiding elders shall be the members of this
   council; provided, that the members who form the council be never fewer
   than nine. And if any unavoidable circumstance prevent the attendance
   of a presiding elder at the council, he shall have authority to send
   another elder out of his own district to represent him; but the elder
   so sent by the absenting presiding elder shall have no seat in the
   council without the approbation of the bishop, or bishops, and
   presiding elders present. And if, after the above-mentioned provisions
   are complied with, any unavoidable circumstance, or any contingencies,
   reduce the number to less than nine, the bishop shall immediately
   summon such elders as do not preside, to complete the number.

   2dly. These shall have authority to mature every thing they shall judge
   expedient.
    1. To preserve the general union:
    2. To render and preserve the external form of worship similar in all
       our societies through the continent:
    3. To preserve the essentials of the Methodist doctrines and
       discipline pure and uncorrupted:
    4. To correct all abuses and disorders: and, lastly, they are
       authorized to mature every thing they may see necessary for the
       good of the church, and for the promoting and improving our
       colleges and plan of education.

   3dly. Provided nevertheless, that nothing shall be received as the
   resolution of the council, unless it be assented to unanimously by the
   council; and nothing so assented to by the council shall be binding in
   any district till it has been agreed upon by a majority of the
   conference which is held for that district.

   4thly. The bishops shall have authority to summon the council to meet
   at such times and places as they shall judge expedient.

   5thly. The first council shall be held at Cokesbury, on the first day
   of next December."

   Mr. Asbury gives the following account of the first meeting of the
   council:--

   "Thursday, December 4. Our council was seated, consisting of the
   following persons, viz.: Richard Ivey, from Georgia; R. Ellis, South
   Carolina; E. Morris, North Carolina; Phil. Bruce, north district of
   Virginia; James O'Kelly, south district of Virginia; L. Green, Ohio;
   Nelson Reid, western shore of Maryland; J. Everett, eastern shore; John
   Dickens, Pennsylvania; J. O. Cromwell, Jersey; and Freeborn Garrettson,
   New York; all our business was done in love and unanimity. The concerns
   of the college were well attended to, as also the printing business. We
   formed some resolutions relative to economy and union, and others
   concerning the funds for the relief of our suffering preachers on the
   frontiers. We rose on the eve of Wednesday following. During our
   sitting, we had preaching every night; some few souls were stirred up,
   and others converted. The prudence of some had stilled the noisy ardor
   of our young people; and it was difficult to rekindle the fire. I
   collected about ?28 for the poor suffering preachers in the west. We
   spent one day in speaking our own experiences, and giving an account of
   the progress and state of the work of God in our several districts; a
   spirit of union pervaded the whole body; producing blessed effects and
   fruits."

   This shows the purity of mind by which those were actuated to whom the
   affairs of the Church were at that time committed. But though the
   preachers generally voted for the plan when it was submitted to them by
   the bishops, dissatisfaction soon sprang up in their minds in reference
   to it, on account of its being dangerous, as they thought, to their
   liberties. It was contended that as the council was composed of the
   bishops and presiding elders, and as the latter were appointed by the
   bishops, and changed at their pleasure, it was virtually concentrating
   all the authority of the Church in the hands of the bishops, and thus
   creating an aristocracy of power incompatible with the rights and
   privileges of the entire body.

   There was, moreover, one clause in the laws which were to control them,
   which went to nullify their proceedings, and frustrate the very design
   for which the council was constituted. It was in these words "Nothing
   unanimously assented to by the council shall be binding in any
   district, till it has been agreed upon by a majority of the conference
   which is held for that district." Such a regulation, every one must
   perceive, tended to a dilution of the body, by introducing dissensions:
   for it could not be expected that so many independent bodies, acting
   separately, should entirely agree in many important particulars. Such,
   accordingly, was the opposition manifested to the organization of this
   council, that it assembled only twice, and therefore it seems
   unnecessary to give a detailed account of its proceedings. But though
   it had but an ephemeral existence, it evinced the necessity more
   strikingly than ever of an organization which should concentrate the
   power of the Church in some body which might exercise it with prudence
   for the general harmony of ministers and people; and this was afterward
   provided for in a General Conference, which should meet once in four
   years, at such time and place as might be agreed upon.

   This year I find the first mention made of a book steward. And as the
   printing and circulating of religious books forms a very important
   feature in the economy of our Church, this seems the most proper place
   to give some account of this establishment.

   Among the means adopted by Mr. Wesley for the diffusion of gospel truth
   and holiness, and for guarding his people against erroneous doctrines,
   was that of printing and circulating books; hence he established a
   press under his own control. Here his own works, and those he extracted
   from others, were printed; and they were distributed by his preachers
   as extensively as possible among the people. Whatever profits might
   arise from the sale of these books were to be appropriated to
   charitable purposes, and to assist in spreading the gospel by means of
   an itinerant ministry. The establishment thus begun by Mr. Wesley, has
   been carried on by the Wesleyan Methodists in England to this day; and
   has been one of the most powerful auxiliaries in promoting the cause of
   Christ by that body of ministers.

   In 1778 Mr. Wesley commenced the publication of the Arminian Magazine,
   a periodical filled with various sorts of information, containing a
   museum of divinity and a great variety of miscellaneous reading. It has
   been continued, greatly enlarged, since his death to this day, now
   called the Wesleyan Methodist Magazine, making in all sixty large
   volumes.

   In the early history of Methodism in this country, the preachers were
   supplied with books from England. But this method of procuring supplies
   became troublesome and expensive, which led to the establishment of a
   similar agency here, for the supply of the people in useful knowledge.
   By a reference to the books of the agency, in the handwriting of John
   Dickens, who was the first book-steward, it appears that the first book
   printed was "A Kempis." This entry is dated August 17, 1789. The first
   volume of the Arminian Magazine was published the same year, also the
   Hymnbook, Saints' Rest, and Primitive Physic.

   I merely notice this here, intending hereafter to devote a chapter to a
   complete history of this institution, its objects, and the influence it
   has exerted on the community.

   Robert Ayers and William Patridge desisted from traveling this year.

   The following preachers had died: --
    1. Henry Bingham, a native of Virginia. He had been four years in the
       ministry, had labored successfully as a pious, humble man, and died
       in peace.
    2. William Gill. He was a native of the state of Delaware, and had
       been in the ministry about twelve years, and stood among the first
       in the conference, both for his experience and knowledge of divine
       things. He was therefore an able preacher, and a deeply devoted man
       of God, inspiring confidence in his wisdom and integrity by all who
       knew him; and in his death religion shone most conspicuously by
       enabling him to die in the triumphs of faith.
    3. John Cooper, who had traveled fifteen years, and was greatly
       beloved by all who knew him, as a pious and holy man. He had been
       the subject of much affliction, but bore it all without murmuring,
       and finally ended his days in peace.
    4. James White, a native of Maryland. He had been about eight years in
       the work of the ministry, was much esteemed as a pious and faithful
       man of God, successful in his work, and resigned in his death.
    5. Francis Spry. He had traveled four years only, was a man of a pious
       life, of sound judgment, a useful preacher, and patient and
       resigned in his death.

   Numbers in the Church: Whites This year, 35,019, Last year, 30,809;
   Increase, 4,210; Colored This year, 8,243, Last year 6,545; Increase,
   1,698; Total This year, 43,262, Last year, 37,354; Increase, 5,908;
   Preachers This year, 196, Last year, 166; Increase, 30.

   1790. The following conferences were held this year: -- February 15th,
   in Charleston, South Carolina; March 2d, in Georgia; April 26th, in
   Kentucky; May 17th, in Holstein; May 24th, in North Carolina; June
   14th, Lane's Church; July 29th, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania; August
   26th, in Leesburgh, Virginia; September 6th, in Baltimore, Maryland;
   September 11th, in Cokesbury, Maryland; September 16th, at Duck Creek;
   September 22d, in Philadelphia; September 28th, in Burlington, New
   Jersey; October 4th, in New York.

   Twenty new circuits were added to the list, as follows: -- Savannah,
   Savannah Town, and Catawba, in the southern part of the work;
   Lexington, Limestone, Madison, Russel, Green, and Lincoln, in the
   western country; Contentney, in the lower part of North Carolina;
   Surry, in the South of Virginia; Stafford and Kanawha, in the northern
   part of the state; South River, in Maryland; Bethel and Randolph, in
   New Jersey; New Haven, Hartford, and Litchfield, in Connecticut; and
   Boston, in Massachusetts.

   We find the following question and answer in the minutes of this year:
   --

   Question What can be done in order to instruct poor children, white and
   black, to read?

   "Answers Let us labor, as the heart and soul of one man, to establish
   Sunday schools in or near the place of public worship. Let persons be
   appointed by the bishops, elders, deacons, or preachers, to teach,
   gratis, all that will attend and have a capacity to learn, from six
   o'clock in the morning till ten, and from two o'clock in the afternoon
   till six, where it does not interfere with public worship. The council
   shall compile a proper schoolbook, to teach them learning and piety.

   This is the first account we have of Sabbath schools in this country;
   and they appear to have been established chiefly for the instruction of
   children, whether white or black, who had not the advantages of day
   schools. It was found, however, on experiment, that it was extremely
   difficult to induce those children to attend the schools, and in a
   short time the teachers, who had tendered their services gratuitously,
   became discouraged, and the schools were discontinued.

   Such schools had been in successful operation in England for several
   years, were warmly patronized by Mr. Wesley, his preachers and people,
   and were exerting a salutary influence on the poorer part of the rising
   generation. In this country, it seems, the Methodists at that time were
   alone in their efforts to introduce this mode of instruction among the
   children and youth of their congregations; and hence, not succeeding
   according to their wishes, prematurely laid it aside. They scarcely
   thought, it is presumed, that this practice would thereafter be so
   generally adopted as it since has been, by Christian denominations, and
   become such an integral part of religious instruction. May it never be
   discontinued, until the whole population of our globe shall become
   imbued with the light and power of Christianity!

   This year was also distinguished by several powerful revivals of
   religion. Speaking of the conference which was held in Charleston,
   South Carolina, Bishop Asbury says, "I have felt fresh springs of
   desire in my soul for a revival of religion. O may the work be
   general;" and then remarks that, after preaching, "extracts from sundry
   letters from New York and Baltimore were read in the congregation, at
   which saints and sinners were affected."

   After the close of the conference he set off on a journey to Kentucky,
   which was then a comparative wilderness. In this tour he crossed the
   Allegheny Mountains, which, in some places, he says, "were rising
   before him like the roof of a house." "Those who wish," he adds, "to
   know how rough it is, may tread in our path. What made it worse to me
   was, that while I was looking to see what had become of my guide, I was
   carried off with full force against a tree that hung across the road
   some distance from the ground, and my head received a very great jar,
   which, however, was lessened by my having on a hat that was strong in
   the crown." After pushing their way rough the wilderness, often having
   to swim the creeks with their horses, sleep in log huts, or encamp in
   the woods, he makes the following entry in his Journal: -- "From
   December 14, 1789, to April 20, 1790, we compute to have traveled two
   thousand five hundred and seventy-eight miles. Hitherto has the Lord
   helped. Glory! glory to our God!" And the reader will recollect that
   neither steamboats nor railroads were in use in those days; but they
   were forced to wend their way through the new settlements in the best
   way they could, chiefly on horseback. As to the preachers who traveled
   this rough and poor country, they had to submit to all manner of
   hardships, so that Bishop Asbury says of them, "I found the poor
   preachers indifferently clad, with emaciated bodies, and subject to
   hard fare; but I hope they are rich in faith."

   That the reader may see the difficulties with which these primitive
   Methodist preachers had to contend, as well as the hardships and
   privations they endured, the following extracts from Bishop Asbury's
   Journal are given: --

   After crossing the Kentucky River he says, --

   "I was strangely outdone for want of sleep, having been greatly
   deprived of it in my journey through the wilderness, which is like
   being at sea in some respects, and in others worse. Our way is over
   mountains, steep hills, deep rivers, and muddy creeks; a thick growth
   of reeds for miles together, and no inhabitants but wild beasts and
   savage men. Sometimes, before I was aware, my ideas would be leading me
   to be looking out ahead for a fence, and I would, without reflection,
   try to recollect the houses we should have lodged at in the wilderness.
   I slept about an hour the first night, and about two the last. We ate
   no regular meal; our bread grew short, and I was very much spent."

   Bishop Asbury stopped at the house of a gentleman whose wife, he says,
   "a tender, gracious soul, was taken a prisoner by the Indians during
   the last war, and carried to Detroit." He then adds, "I saw the graves
   of the slain -- twenty-four in one camp. I learn that they had set no
   guard, and that they were up late playing at cards. A poor woman of the
   company had dreamed three times that the Indians had surprised and
   killed them all: she urged her husband to entreat the people to set a
   guard, but they only abused him and cursed him for his pains. As the
   poor woman was relating her last dream the Indians came upon the camp:
   she and her husband sprang away, one east, the other west, and escaped.
   He afterward came back, and witnessed the carnage. These poor sinners
   appeared to be ripe for destruction. I received another account of the
   death of another wicked wretch who was shot through the heart, although
   he had vaunted with horrid oaths that no Creek Indian could kill him.
   These are some of the melancholy accidents to which the country is
   subject for the present."

   This shows the jeopardy to which those were often exposed who traversed
   this newly settled country in quest of immortal souls, and the
   intrepidity displayed in encountering these "perils by land," by those
   who first penetrated these western wilds as heralds of peace and good
   will. In Lexington, Bishop Asbury met the preachers in conference, the
   business which, he says, they "went through with in great love and
   harmony." They had preaching at "noon and night, souls were converted,
   and the fallen restored. My soul," he adds, "has been blessed among
   these people, and I am exceedingly pleased with them. I would not, for
   the worth of all the place, have been prevented in this visit, having
   no doubt but that it will be for the good of the present and rising
   generation. It is true, such exertions of mind and body are trying; but
   I am supported under it if souls are saved, it is enough."

   At this conference a plan was devised for a district school, and three
   hundred dollars were subscribed, in land and money for its
   establishment. The school afterward went into operation, but for want
   of adequate support was finally discontinued. After visiting some
   places on the west of the mountains, Bishop Asbury set off on his
   return to the Atlantic slates. The following is his own account of the
   manner in which this tedious journey was performed: --

   "Monday 24. We set out on our return through the wilderness with a
   large and helpless company; we had about fifty people, twenty of whom
   were armed, and five of whom might have stood fire. To reserve order
   and harmony, we had articles drawn up for, and signed by our company,
   and I arranged the people for traveling according to the regulations
   agreed upon. Some disaffected gentlemen, who would neither sign nor
   come under discipline, had yet the impudence to murmur when left
   behind. The first night we lodged some miles beyond the hazelpatch. The
   next day we discovered signs of Indians, and some thought they heard
   voices; we therefore thought it best to travel on, and did not encamp
   until three o'clock, halting on the east side of Cumberland River. We
   had gnats enough. We had an alarm, but it turned out to be a false
   alarm. A young gentleman, a Mr. Alexander, behaved exceedingly well;
   but his tender frame was not adequate to the fatigue to be endured, and
   he had well nigh fainted on the road to Cumberland Gap. Brother Massie
   was captain; and finding I had gained authority among the people, I
   acted somewhat in the capacity of an adjutant and quarter-master among
   them. At the foot of the mountain the company separated; the greater
   part went on with me to Powell's River; here we slept on the earth, and
   next day made the Grassy Valley. Several of the company, who were not
   Methodists, expressed their high approbation of our conduct, and most
   affectionately invited us to their houses. The journeys of each day
   were as follows: Monday, forty-five miles; Tuesday, fifty miles;
   Wednesday, sixty miles."

   From this time Bishop Asbury traveled very extensively through the
   several states where Methodist societies had been established, and
   contributed much by his labors to promote the work of God, which was
   extending powerfully in many places, and particularly in some parts of
   New England, under the labors of the Rev. Jesse Lee and his helpers.

   This year Methodism was introduced into the city of Boston. It is true,
   that about eighteen years previous to this time, Mr. Boardman had
   visited Boston, and formed a small society; but as he was not succeeded
   by any minister of the same order, the society gradually diminished,
   and finally became extinct. Mr. Garrettson had also passed through
   Boston, on his way from Nova Scotia, and preached a few sermons in a
   private house; but no society had been formed by him. On the arrival of
   Mr. Lee, no house could be procured for preaching; he therefore went
   upon the Common, stood upon a table, and began to sing and pray. When
   he commenced there were only four persons present; but before he had
   concluded there had collected, as he thought, not less than three
   thousand. The word preached had an effect upon the minds of a few who
   attended, so that on the next Sabbath, at the same place, the number of
   hearers was greatly increased; and a way was thus opened for the
   establishment of a small society in the town of Boston. It is an
   evidence, however, of the determined opposition which was felt here to
   Methodism, that Mr. Lee was in the city for about a week, using every
   means in his power to procure a house to preach in, but was denied in
   every instance in which he made application either publicly or
   privately, and was finally forced either to abandon the place without
   preaching at all, or to go on to the Common. Here, therefore, he set up
   his banner in the name of the Lord, and many have since, though not
   without much hard toiling and many privations, flocked around it.

   While in Boston, Mr. Lee received an invitation from a gentleman in
   Lynn, about ten miles from Boston, for him to visit that place. This
   gentleman, a Mr. Benjamin Johnson, had heard Methodist preaching about
   twenty years before, in one of the southern states. Mr. Lee was,
   therefore, very cordially received, and he soon found himself among "a
   people prepared of the Lord" to embrace the pure doctrines of Jesus
   Christ. After giving an account of a sermon he had delivered at Mr.
   Lye's, at Wood End, he says, --

   "I felt great enlargement of heart, and much of the divine presence,
   while I was warning the people not to be deceived. The presence of God
   was in the assembly, and some of the hearers appeared to be greatly
   lifted up in love and thankfulness. O! that God may continue the
   serious impressions in their minds, till they are brought to the
   knowledge of God. I have not met with a company of people for a long
   time that had so much of the appearance of a Methodist congregation as
   this."

   The word preached in Lynn took such effect that in about two months
   after Mr. Lee first visited the place, February 20, 1791, a society of
   thirty members was formed, and by the month of May following upward of
   seventy had received certificates that they attended Methodist meeting.
   So rapidly did the work progress, that on the 14th of June following,
   they began to build a house of worship; and "the people had such a mind
   to work" that the house was raised on the 21st, and dedicated on the
   26th of the same month. This is said to have been the first Methodist
   church which was built in the state of Massachusetts.

   Many other towns in this state were visited by Mr. Lee in the course of
   this year; in all which, notwithstanding the opposition generally
   manifested by the settled clergy and many of their congregations, he
   found access to the people. Salem, Newburyport, Danvers, Marblehead,
   and Charlestown were severally visited, and regular preaching
   established; and a foundation was thus laid for Methodism in that land
   of the "pilgrim fathers."

   The circuits also in Connecticut were greatly enlarged, and several new
   ones added by those enterprising preachers who followed in the track of
   Mr. Lee. Many amusing and instructive anecdotes might be related
   respecting the manner in which these preachers were received and
   treated in this part of the country. As they did not suppose any man
   could be qualified to preach the gospel without a classical education,
   almost the first question asked by the ministers with whom they came in
   contact would be, whether they had a "liberal education." Mr. Lee was a
   shrewd man, and was seldom at a loss for an answer suited to the
   occasion. He says, in one place, "The woman of the house asked me a few
   questions, and in a little time wanted to know if I had a liberal
   education. I told her I had just education enough to carry me through
   the country." Soon after a similar question was propounded to him by
   one of the principal men of the town, before he would give his consent
   for Mr. Lee to preach in the court house, to whom he replied, "I have
   nothing to boast of; though I have education enough to carry me through
   the country." On another occasion, a young lawyer, with a view to
   puzzle Mr. Lee, addressed him in Latin, to whom he replied in German --
   a language not understood by either the speaker or his friends, who
   were anxiously listening to the conversation. " There," said a
   gentleman who was in the secret of the lawyer's intentions, "the
   preacher has answered you in Hebrew, and therefore he must be a learned
   man." This repartee of Mr. Lee silenced the inquisitiveness of the
   facetious lawyer, and gave the former the decided advantage over his
   antagonist.

   But the most effectual method adopted by the Methodist preachers was,
   when they came in company with those who were fond of disputations, and
   this was very general in New England, to urge upon the people the
   necessity of being soundly converted to God, and of enjoying an
   evidence of their acceptance in his sight, through faith in the Lord
   Jesus. And through, their persevering diligence in this good work, God
   blessed their labors abundantly in various places, so that a foundation
   was laid by their labors and privations for that extensive spread of
   evangelical principles, and piety which we have lived to see in that
   part of our country.

   But the most difficult place to plant the tree of Methodism was in the
   city of Boston. It was a considerable time, as already related, before
   they could procure even a private house to preach in; and when they
   succeeded thus far, such was the general prejudice against them that
   they could not long retain possession of it. At length they succeeded
   in obtaining the use of a school-house, but this was soon after denied
   them. They then rented a chamber in the north end of the town, where
   they continued regularly for a considerable time. A small society had
   been formed on the 13th of July, 1792, and though few in number, and
   generally poor, with a view to obviate the difficulties they had to
   contend with, they undertook to build a house of worship. To aid them
   in this pious design, money was begged for them on the eastern shore of
   Maryland, in the state of Delaware, Philadelphia, and in New York. By
   the aid thus afforded they were encouraged to proceed in their labors;
   and on the 28th day of August, 1795, the corner stone for the first
   Methodist church was laid in Boston. It was a wooden building,
   forty-six feet in length and thirty-six in breadth. At this time there
   were but forty-two members in the Church in Boston, two of whom were
   colored persons. After the opening of this house the congregation very
   considerably increased, especially in the evenings, at which time many,
   who were ashamed to be seen going to a Methodist meeting by daylight,
   would assemble to hear the "strange doctrine," as it was called.

   In Salem, on some of his first visits, Mr. Lee was invited by the
   minister, the Rev. Mr. Hopkins, into his pulpit; but at length he was
   informed by Mr. Hopkins, that though he could not find any particular
   fault with his preaching, yet such was the opposition of some of his
   people, that he thought not prudent to admit Mr. Lee to his pulpit any
   more. Mr. Lee then thanked him for his former kindness, and they parted
   with mutual good will.

   Hitherto I have recorded the names of those who were located, expelled,
   or had died; but as the continuance of these records would swell this
   history beyond reasonable bounds; and as their names, with a brief
   sketch of the characters of those who had died in the work, will be
   found in the minutes of the conferences, it is thought to be
   inexpedient to insert the names of all such, but only those who may
   have been most eminently useful in the cause of God.

   This year eight received a location, and three had departed this life.
   One of these last, John Tunnel, was elected to the office of an elder
   at the Christmas conference in 1784, and was eminently useful as a
   minister of Christ. He had traveled extensively throughout the United
   States, was highly esteemed for the depth and uniformity of his piety,
   his indefatigable labors, and his commanding talents as a preacher. He
   died in great peace near the Sweet Springs, in Virginia, the Church
   deeply lamenting loss of such a devoted and useful servant.

   Numbers in the Church: Whites This year, 45,949, Last year, 35,019,
   Increase 10,930; Colored This year, 11,682, Last year, 8,243, Increase,
   3,439; Total This year, 57,631, Last year, 43,263, Increase, 14,369;
   Preachers This year, 227, Last year, 196, Increase, 31.

   This was by far the largest, increase which had been realized in any
   one year, and shows the happy effects of the revivals we have
   mentioned.

   1791. There were thirteen conferences held this year, at the following
   times and places: -- At Charleston, South Carolina, on the 22d of
   February; in Georgia, on the 16th of February; at Mr. McKnight's, North
   Carolina, on the 2d of April; at Petersburgh, Virginia, on the 20th of
   April; at Hanover, on the 26th of April; in Alexandria, District of
   Columbia, on the 2d of May; in Baltimore, on the 6th of May; at Duck
   Creek, on the 13th of May; in Philadelphia, on the 18th of May; in New
   York, on the 26th of May; in Connecticut, on the 23d of July; in
   Uniontown, on the 28th of July; in Albany, on the 23d of August.

   Ten new circuits were added to the list, namely, Edisto Island, in
   South Carolina; Union, in Virginia; Queen Anne's, in Maryland;
   Northumberland, in Pennsylvania; Otsego and Saratoga, in New York;
   Stockbridge, in Massachusetts; and Kingston, in Upper Canada. Boston
   was exchanged for Lynn in the minutes.

   As this is the first notice we have of a circuit in Canada, it is
   considered expedient to give some account of the state of things in
   that country.

   Though Canada was discovered by the English as early as 1497, yet it
   was first settled by the French in 1608. In 1763, after the capture of
   Quebec by General Wolfe, the whole country passed into the hands of the
   English, and so remains to the present day.

   As this country was first settled by the French, the Roman Catholic
   religion chiefly prevailed there, but more particularly in the lower
   province. After the conquest of the country by the English, the Church
   of England was established by law, though at the same time the Roman
   Catholic Church had all their religious rights and privileges
   guarantied to them by an act of the king and parliament of Great
   Britain. These provisions, however, did not exclude other sects from
   settling among them, and of enjoying their respective peculiarities,
   with the exception of solemnizing the rites of matrimony.

   But while the great majority of the people of Lower Canada were French
   Catholics, the upper province was settled principally by Protestant
   refugees from the United States, disbanded soldiers from the British
   army, and by English, Scotch, and Irish emigrants but at the time of
   which we are now speaking, the country was extremely destitute of the
   word and ordinances of Christianity. For though the English Church had
   a name to live there, but few of her ministers were found among the
   people, and even these few were destitute of the requisite
   qualifications of ministers of the sanctuary. Hence the people
   generally were living in ignorance of God, alike destitute of the
   ordinances of religion for themselves, and the means of education for
   their children.

   In this state of things, Upper Canada was visited by William Losee, a
   member of the New York conference, in the year 1791. He went through
   the wilderness of the western part of the slate of New York, suffering
   numerous privations and hardships, and crossed the lower part of Lake
   Ontario to Kingston. In attempting to form a circuit along the banks of
   the lake and of the bay of Quinte, he found here and there an
   individual who had heard the Methodist preachers in England or in the
   United States. By these he was cordially received; and he succeeded in
   forming a circuit, and establishing a few classes. The next year Darius
   Dunham was sent to Canada. He and brother Losee extended their labors
   from the bay of Quinte down the banks of the river St. Lawrence,
   forming what was called the Oswegotchie circuit; and the next year
   there were returned on the minutes of conference, as the fruit of their
   labors, one hundred and sixty-five members of the Church.

   From this time the work of God went on gradually in Canada, until it
   eventuated in one of the most glorious revivals of religion we have on
   record in these modern days. It will be noticed more particularly in
   the proper place.

   This year, with a view to guard against imposture, the brethren and
   friends were cautioned, in the minutes of conference, to which Mr.
   Hamitt took exceptions, and which has been before quoted, against
   receiving any in the character of Methodist preachers, unless they came
   recommended by the proper authorities of the Church. Perhaps no people
   have been more exposed to impositions of this character than the
   Methodists; by reason of their peculiar organization, and the constant
   habit, at that time especially not much practiced by other
   denominations, of itinerating so extensively through the country, and
   the numerous emigrants from Europe, many of whom, having lost their
   character at home, sought a shelter from their disgrace in America. Yet
   there is no necessity of suffering from these impostors, if the people
   would only examine those who come among them in the character of
   preachers, and ascertain whether or not they are furnished with proper
   credentials.

   This year was also highly favored with the outpourings of the Spirit of
   God in many places. In New England especially many doors were opened,
   and solicitations sent for Methodist preaching, notwithstanding the
   opposition which was manifested to the peculiarities of Methodism. The
   doctrines of universal redemption, conditional election and
   perseverance, and more especially of Christian perfection, were most
   violently opposed by the "standing order" in this country, and the
   preachers were frequently called upon to defend these truths against
   subtle and powerful adversaries. Although they in general endeavored to
   avoid disputations of this character, they were often reluctantly drawn
   into them in the midst of the people, or they must abandon to their
   antagonists what they considered the truths of God. Their doctrines,
   however, gradually gained upon the understandings and affections of
   many of the people, and commended themselves to their approbation by
   the happy effect which they produced in the hearts and lives of such as
   had embraced them.

   Dr. Coke and Bishop Asbury traveled extensively through the southern
   states, and rejoiced together in beholding the prosperity of the work
   of God in many places. We have already seen that the Council had become
   unpopular among the preachers, and that they were obliged, after the
   second year's trial, to abandon it. It seems that, among others who
   were much opposed to committing the affairs of the Church to so few
   hands, James O'Kelly was one of the foremost, and that by letters from
   him Dr. Coke's mind had become influenced against it. Hence Bishop
   Asbury, with whom the Council was a favorite, remarks, "I found the
   doctor had much changed his sentiments since his last visit to this
   continent, and that these impressions still continued. I hope to be
   enabled to give up for peace' sake, and to please all men for their
   good to edification." In this spirit of sacrifice he yielded to the
   general wish for the substitution of a General Conference in the place
   of the Council.

   After traversing the southern and middle states, generally preaching
   every day, Bishop Asbury, for the first time, visited New England this
   year; and the following extracts from his Journal will show how he felt
   on his entrance into this land of the Puritans, and what were his first
   impressions on beholding the state of things here. Under date of June
   4, he says, --

   "I went on to Redding. Surely God will work powerfully among these
   people, and save thousands of them." -- "This country is very hilly and
   open, not unlike that about the Peak of Derbyshire. I feel faith to
   believe that this visit to New England will be blessed to my own soul,
   and to the souls of others. We are now in Connecticut, and never out of
   sight of a house, and sometimes we have a view of many churches and
   steeples, built very neatly of wood." -- "There may have been a praying
   ministry and people here, but I fear they are now spiritually dead, and
   am persuaded that family and private prayer is very little practiced.
   Could these people be brought to constant, fervent prayer, the Lord
   would come down and work wonders among them."

   From this place he traveled through various towns, preaching the
   "gospel of the kingdom" to all who would come and hear, and on the 9th
   came to the pleasant city of New Haven, the Athens of New England. His
   appointment having been published in the newspapers, many came to hear,
   among whom was the president of Yale College, the Rev. Dr. Stiles, and
   several other clergymen. He remarks, that though they heard with
   attention and gravity, yet, after meeting, no one asked him to his
   house; and though he attended the college at the hour of prayer, no one
   gave him an invitation to visit the interior of the college buildings.
   This cold reception, he says, reminded him of the words of Mr.
   Whitefield to Messrs. Boardman and Pillmore, on their arrival in
   America: --

   "Ah," said he, "if ye were Calvinists, ye would take the country before
   ye." "Should Cokesbury or Baltimore," he adds, "ever furnish the
   opportunity, I, in my turn, will requite their behavior by treating
   them as friends, brethren, and gentlemen. The difficulty I met with in
   New Haven for lodging, and for a place to hold meeting, made me feel
   and know the worth of Methodists more than ever."

   From New Haven Bishop Asbury passed on through Middletown to New
   London, and thence to Providence in Rhode Island where he took sweet
   counsel with the Rev. Mr. Snow, a pious Congregational minister, then
   aged about seventy years, who had been brought to the knowledge of the
   truth by the Rev. Mr. Tenant, "whose memory," says the bishop, "I
   revere." Of the people of Providence he makes the following remarks: --

   "They appear to be prudent, active, frugal; cultivating a spirit of
   good family economy; and they are kind to strangers. They have
   frequently had revivals of religion. I had faith to believe the Lord
   would shortly visit them again, and that even we shall have something
   to do in this town.

   From Providence he went on to Boston, where he met with a very cold
   reception, owing to the want of boldness and energy in the few who
   professed to be friends. Such were the discouragements thrown in his
   way in this place that he says, "I have done with Boston until we can
   obtain a lodging, a house to preach in, and some to join us." In Lynn
   he met with a most cordial and welcome reception, and says, which
   indeed is proved to have been prophetic, "Here we shall make a firm
   stand, and from this central point, from Lynn, shall the light of
   Methodism radiate through the state."

   From hence he passed on through Worcester and the intervening towns to
   Hartford, and from thence to Albany, N. Y., where he arrived on the
   20th of July. After a short review of his recent travels in New
   England, and observations upon the religious state of the people, he
   says, --

   "I am led to think the eastern church will find this saying hold true
   in regard to the Methodists, I will provoke you to jealousy by a people
   that were no people; and by a foolish nation will I anger you.' They
   have trodden upon the Quakers, the Episcopalians, the Baptist -- see
   now if the Methodists do not work their way."

   I have been thus particular in following the first tour made by Bishop
   Asbury into New England; that the reader may see with what
   indefatigable industry this man of God fulfilled the high and important
   office he sustained in the Methodist Church, and the influence which
   his labors exerted in the cause of Christ in that part of our country.
   His office was no sinecure, but one of increasing toil and sacrifice,
   and in the exercise of it he gave the most devoted attention to the
   best interests of mankind; nor were his impressions respecting the
   state of things in New England, and his anticipations of the success of
   Methodism among that people, either erroneous or chimerical; for they
   have since been verified by the course of events. From this land, where
   Christianity was interwoven with the civil institutions, have shot
   forth those branches which have since extended even to the far west,
   and are now flourishing in all the freshness of perennial growth in
   those new states and territories.

   This year was distinguished by the death of that eminent man of God and
   founder of Methodism, the Rev. John Wesley. Dr. Coke and Bishop Asbury
   were in Virginia when this melancholy news reached them; and the
   following are the reflections which the latter makes on hearing this
   mournful event: --

   "The solemn news reached our ears that the public papers had announced
   the death of that dear man of God, John Wesley. He died in his own
   house in London, in the eighty-eighth year of his age, after preaching
   the gospel sixty-four years. When we consider his plain and nervous
   writings; his uncommon talent for sermonizing and journalizing; that he
   had such a steady flow of animal spirits; so much of the spirit of
   government in him; knowledge as an observer; his attainments as a
   scholar; his experience as a Christian; I conclude his equal is not to
   be found among all the sons he hath brought up; nor his superior among
   all the sons of Adam he may have left behind. Brother Coke was sunk in
   spirit, and wished to hasten home immediately. For my part,
   notwithstanding my long absence from Mr. Wesley, and a few unpleasant
   expressions in some of the letters the dear old man has written to me,
   occasioned by the misrepresentations of others, I feel the stroke most
   sensibly; and I expect I shall never read his Works without reflecting
   on the loss which the church of God and the world have sustained by his
   death."

   The death of Mr. Wesley, though from his great age it must have been
   generally expected by his friends, was an event mournfully felt
   throughout the Christian church, and more especially through all the
   ranks of Methodism. His character is now so well known that it is
   scarcely necessary to add any thing here to what has already been said
   in the published accounts of this great and good man. As long as pure
   Christianity shall remain, So long will the name of Wesley be held in
   grateful remembrance. For among all those who have been raised up in
   modern days to revive and diffuse abroad the pure principles of the
   gospel, no one shone so conspicuously, nor exerted such a holy and
   extensive influence, as did John Wesley. His writings will speak for
   him, and proclaim him the sound divine, the ripe and finished scholar,
   the deep and sincere Christian, and a man of the most enlarged
   philanthropy, so long as pure Christianity shall be held in esteem,
   while the scribblings of his defamers shall be held in execration by
   all pious and well-informed ChristiAnswers And the society he was
   instrumental in raising up and establishing in Great Britain, as well
   as the Church which was organized under his direction in America, shall
   remain as monuments of his wisdom in devising and executing plans for
   the diffusion of gospel truth and holiness, and for the permanent
   establishment of such associations as be instrumental in transmitting
   these blessings from generation to generation.

   That the Church, in both hemispheres, should mourn the loss of such a
   man is nothing more than what could have been expected, while the fact
   that he had been instrumental in raising up men, as his sons in the
   gospel, competent to carry out, and to continue in operation, the plans
   he had devised for the salvation of the world, evinces the wisdom and
   energy with which he had applied himself to his work. While, therefore,
   his weeping friends stood around his bed, and heard his last dying
   words, "The best of all is, God is with us," they gathered fresh
   courage to trust in the God of his life for a continuance of his
   blessing upon his mourning Church.

   In consequence of this afflictive intelligence, Dr. Coke hastened to
   prepare for his departure from the continent, that he might mingle his
   sorrows with his brethren in Europe over the loss they had sustained in
   the death of Mr. Wesley. On his way he stopped at Baltimore, and on
   Sabbath preached a sermon on the occasion of the death of Mr. Wesley,
   in which he mentioned some things which gave offense to his American
   brethren. His profound sorrow at the loss of Mr. Wesley, though an
   event which, in the ordinary course of nature, must have been
   anticipated as near at hand, and the keen sensibilities of his heart to
   every thing which had the remotest tendency to tarnish the glory of
   that great man, led him to say, in the above sermon, that the act of
   leaving Mr. Wesley's name from the minutes probably hastened his death.

   This circumstance would be hardly worthy of notice, had not some
   persons, more distinguished for their petulance than their candor,
   seized upon it for the purpose of disparaging the character of the
   American conference. In addition to what has already been said in
   reference to this matter, the following particulars may serve to
   vindicate the conduct of the conference, as well as to apologize for
   the precipitancy of Dr. Coke in making the assertion, erroneous in
   itself, in so public a manner -- a fault amply atoned for by the
   sincerity and frankness with which he afterward deported himself toward
   his American brethren. Were the judgments of mankind infallible in all
   cases, we should be saved the necessity of offering apologies for such
   venial instances of human infirmity.

   That we may rightly understand this subject, it is necessary to review
   some of the doings of the conferences of 1784 and 1787. The minute of
   the conference of 1784, already noticed, respecting obeying Mr. Wesley
   during his lifetime, stood unrepealed until 1787, when it was omitted.
   Among other reasons for this omission, one unquestionably was, to
   prevent any one from accusing them, as some had already done, of being
   under the dictation and control of a British subject, who had written
   against the American revolution, and thereby of subjecting themselves
   to the suspicion of disloyalty to their own government; and also to
   remove every apprehension of having Bishop Asbury, whom they so highly
   respected and affectionately loved, taken from among them. This was an
   event the more to be deprecated, as they knew of no one who could fill
   his place. He had grown up with them -- had suffered and sympathized
   with them during a protracted and sanguinary war -- had fully
   identified his interests, his weal or woe, with t heirs and had,
   moreover, become familiar with their character and peculiar
   circumstances, both as American citizens and as Methodist preachers;
   and hence, whatever deference they might have felt for Dr. Coke -- and
   they certainly were not deficient in love and respect for him -- past
   experience convinced them that he did not understand their affairs so
   well as did Bishop Asbury. And that which gave origin to their fears
   that such a dictation as has been supposed might be exercised over
   their affairs, was the fact heretofore alluded to, that in 1787, Dr.
   Coke, at the request of Mr. Wesley, altered the time of holding the
   General Conference, without consulting the American preachers, and also
   requested Mr. Whatcoat to be elected a joint superintendent with Bishop
   Asbury. [23] That Mr. Wesley was dissatisfied with this omission is
   certain, from some expressions in his letters to Bishop Asbury about
   that time, to which the bishop alludes in the above notice of Mr.
   Wesley's death, and which probably led to the famous letter in which
   Bishop Asbury is censured for taking the title of bishop, concerning
   which so much has been said by the enemies of Methodist episcopacy.
   [24]

   As to the minute to which allusion has been made, it was a voluntary
   act of the conference, and not a contract mutually entered into between
   them and Mr. Wesley, and therefore its omission in 1787 was no
   violation of a pledged faith between the parties. But as some of the
   enemies of Bishop Asbury have blamed him in this business, it seems
   proper to give his own version of these acts of the conference, with a
   view to justify himself in reference to this affair. He says, "I never
   approved of that binding minute," alluding to the minute of 1784, in
   which they promised obedience to Mr. Wesley in matters of church
   government: --

   "I did not think it practical expediency to obey Mr. Wesley at three
   thousand miles' distance, in all matters relative to church government;
   neither did brother Whatcoat, nor several others. At the first General
   Conference I was mute and modest when it passed, and I was mute when it
   was expunged. For this Mr. Wesley blamed me, and was displeased that I
   did not rather reject the whole connection, or leave them, if they did
   not comply. But I could not give up the connection so easily, after
   laboring so many years with and for them."

   But although Mr. Wesley suffered a momentary displeasure to arise in
   his mind on account of their rescinding the rule in question, and with
   characteristic plainness expressed his dissatisfaction to Bishop
   Asbury, yet when the thing was fully explained to him, together with
   the motives which prompted them to that act, he became satisfied with
   the uprightness of their conduct, and expressed, only twenty-nine days
   before his death, his unabated attachment to his American brethren, in
   the following letter to the Rev. Ezekiel Cooper: --

   Near London, Feb. 1, 1791.

   "My Dear Brother, -- Those who desire to write, or say any thing to me,
   have no time to lose; for time has shaken me by the hand, and death is
   not far behind. But I have reason to be thankful for the time that is
   past: I felt few of the infirmities of age for fourscore and six years.
   It was not till a year and a half ago that my strength and sight
   failed. And still I am enabled to scrawl a little, and to creep, though
   I cannot run. Probably I should not be able to do so much, did not many
   of you assist me by your prayers. I have given a distinct account of
   the work of God which has been wrought in Britain and Ireland for more
   than half a century. We want some of you to give us a connected
   relation of what our Lord has been doing in America, from the time that
   Richard Boardman accepted the invitation, and left his country to serve
   you. See that you never give place to one thought of separating from
   your brethren in Europe. Lose no opportunity of declaring to all men
   that the Methodists are one people in all the world; and that it is
   their full determination so to continue,

   Though mountains rise, and oceans roll, To sever us in vain.

   To the care of our common Lord, I commit you; and am your affectionate
   friend and brother,

   "John Wesley."

   After reading such an epistle as this, who can doubt of the writer's
   affectionate regard for his American brethren, as well as his strong
   desire for their indissoluble union with their brethren in Europe? --
   Such sentiments were highly worthy the apostolic character which Mr.
   Wesley sustained, as well as the position he occupied as the founder
   and leader of the entire denomination on both sides of the Atlantic --
   standing, as he did, upon the margin of time, with eternity full in his
   view! May it ever be the aim of both families of the Methodists to
   cultivate the spirit herein recommended!

   Having arranged his affairs for his departure to England, on the 14th
   of May, after an affectionate parting with Bishop Asbury and several of
   the preachers who were assembled in Philadelphia, Dr. Coke set sail for
   London, where he arrived in safety after a short and pleasant voyage.
   On his arrival in England, at this eventful crisis in the history of
   Methodism, he found that suspicions had been engendered in the circle
   of his acquaintance respecting the purity of his motives in hastening
   from his work in America. Though his future conduct put to silence all
   such suspicions, yet to a mind alive to every thing which would affect
   his reputation, and thereby wound the holy cause in which he was
   engaged, it was no small trial of his faith and patience to have the
   purity of his motives questioned, or his conduct unjustly censured. In
   the midst of these conflicts, confiding in the integrity of his own
   heart, and relying upon the protection of him who had been a
   never-failing source of consolation to him, both in adversity and
   prosperity, Dr. Coke silently bowed to the inscrutable ways of divine
   Providence, while in the meantime he was cheered by the reception of
   the following friendly and sympathizing letter from Bishop Asbury,
   which, as belonging to the history of the times, and as exemplifying
   the spirit and manner in which the writer employed his time, is given
   entire. It is as follows: --

   "Rev. and Most Dear Sir, -- If yet in time, this brings greeting.
   Rejoice with me that the last has been a year of general blessing to
   the church of God in this wilderness. We humbly hope two thousand souls
   were born of God, one of which is well ascertained in Jersey and York.
   East, west, north, and south, the glory of God spreads.

   "I have served the Church upward of twenty-five years in Europe and
   America. All the property I have gained is two old horses, the constant
   companions of my toil, six if not seven thousand miles every year. When
   we have no ferryboats, they swim the rivers. As to clothing, I am
   nearly the same as at the first: neither have I silver nor gold, nor
   any property. My confidential friends know that I lie not in this
   matter. I am resolved not to claim any property in the Book Concern.
   Increase as it may, it will be sacred to invalid preachers, the
   college, and the schools. I would not have my name mentioned as doing,
   having, being any thing but dust.

   "I soar, indeed, but it is over the tops of the highest mountains we
   have, which may vie with the Alps. I creep sometimes upon my hands and
   knees up the slippery ascent; and to serve the Church, and the
   ministers of it, what I gain is many a reflection from both sides of
   the Atlantic. I have lived long enough to be loved and hated, to be
   admired and feared.

   "If it were not for the suspicions of some, and the pride and ignorance
   of others, I am of opinion I could make provision by collections,
   profits on books, and donations in land, to take two thousand children
   under the best plan or education ever known in this country. The Lord
   begins to smile on our Kingswood school. [25] One promising young man
   is gone forth, another is ready, and several have been under
   awakenings. None so healthy and orderly as our children; and some
   promise great talents for learning. The obstinate and ignorant oppose,
   among preachers and people, while the judicious for good sense and
   piety, in church and state, admire and applaud. I am, with most dutiful
   respect, as ever, your son in the gospel,

   "Francis Asbury."

   This letter shows not only the high sense which Bishop Asbury
   entertained for the character of Dr. Coke, his ardent desire for his
   welfare, and the prosperity of the work of God in the conversion of
   sinners, but also the great interest he took in the cause of education,
   affirming that none but the "obstinate and ignorant" opposed their
   laudable efforts to extend its benefits to the youth of our land; and
   that the judicious in church and state admired and applauded the
   literary institution which they had established. And though Providence
   seemed to frown upon the praiseworthy attempts which they made in the
   case of education, it was never lost sight of by its friends, but, as
   we shall see in the course of our history, finally became an integral
   part of the general system of diffusing the lights of knowledge and
   Christianity among the inhabitants of this western world. That, however
   which cheered their hearts and animated them with fresh courage to
   pursue their way, in the midst of the signals of mourning which were
   hung out as tokens of sorrow for the loss of such a man as John Wesley,
   was the ingathering of souls into the fold of Christ, and the continual
   expansion of their field of gospel labor. While the strife of tongues
   was heard uttering reproach upon their character and conduct, conscious
   of the integrity of their hearts, and the purity of their motive, they
   rejoiced in beholding the right hand of their God stretched out to do
   them good, to sanction the efforts of their hearts and hands. The
   following will show the result of this year's labor: --

   Numbers in the Church: Whites This year, 50,385, Last year, 45,949;
   Increase, 4,436; Colored This year, 12,884, Last year, 11,682;
   Increase, 1,202; [Corrected] Total This year, 63,269, [26] Last year,
   57,631; Increase, 5,638; Preachers This year, 250, Last year, 227;
   Increase 23.

   [16] Mr. Lee assigns other reasons for the nonelection of Mr.
   Garrettson but the above is taken from Mr. G's own account of the
   transaction, in which he corrects the mistake of Mr. Lee.

   [17] See "Defense of our Fathers," and "An Original Church of Christ. "

   [18] See book iii, chap. ii.

   [19] How such an affirmation could have been made by any honest and
   intelligent American appears almost inconceivable, when it is so well
   known that General Washington was at that time, 1785, a private
   gentleman, living on his farm in Virginia, and was not elected
   president of the United States until 1789. The fact is, as stated in
   Mr. Morrell's letter, (which see,) that the address was written at the
   time it stands dated in the address itself, during the session of the
   New York conference in June, 1789, and at the very time the congress
   were assembled, and a few days after Washington had delivered his first
   inaugural address to the representatives of the nation. How could an
   address be presented to President Washington when there was no such
   official personage in existence! The supposition carries such
   self-evident absurdity on its face, that it is a wonder how malignant
   ingenuity itself could have ever hazarded its assertion. Its refutation
   therefore is rendered necessary only from the fact, that such is the
   state of human society that no absurdity is too glaring to gain some
   proselytes.

   [20] There is a trifling error in the date in Dr. Emory's account, as
   he says it was the 3d of June. The true date of the document, May 29,
   1789, it will be perceived, corresponds with the date given to it by
   Mr. Sparks.

   [21] [Transcriber Endnote: See also P. Douglass Gorrie's Sketch of the
   Life of Jesse Lee among our data files -- Livesof.exe, Chapter 11. --
   DVM]

   [22] Mr. Embury continued a faithful follower of Jesus Christ, and a
   diligent laborer in the gospel as a local preacher in the Methodist
   connection, until the year 1775, when he ended his days in peace in the
   above region of country; and his remains were buried about seven miles
   distant from Ashgrove, "in a spot of peculiar beauty in the gorge of
   two romantic hills, on a small elevation surrounded by a lovely
   scenery, and in view of two or three handsome cottages." In 1832, some
   of his surviving friends, moved by a pious respect to the memory of
   this humble and devoted servant of God, and with a view to deposit his
   bones in a burying ground in the midst of his children and friends, had
   them removed from their former resting place, and, with suitable
   religious services, in the presence of a large multitude of people who
   had assembled on the occasion, committed them to the earth in the
   Methodist burying ground in Ashgrove. Over them is placed a marble
   tablet, with the following inscription: --

   PHILIP EMBURY,

   The earliest American minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, Here
   found His last earthly resting place. Precious in the sight of the Lord
   is the death of his saints, &c.
   The remainder of the epitaph need not be copied here. The widow of Mr.
   Embury was afterward married to a member of our Church by the name of
   Lawrence, who settled in Upper Canada, and they were the nucleus of a
   society in the place where they lived, which has continued to flourish
   to the present day.

   [23] Mr. Wesley undoubtedly alludes to this unpleasant affair in his
   Journal, under date of July 26, 1787. He says, "We were agreeably
   surprised with the arrival of Dr. Cake, who came from Philadelphia in
   nine and twenty days, and gave us a pleasing account of the work of God
   in America." -- "I desired all our preachers to meet me and consider
   the state of our brethren in America, who have been terribly frightened
   at their own shadow, as if the English preachers were just going to
   enslave them. I believe that fear is now over, and they are more aware
   of Satan's devices." Their fears, whether groundless or not, were
   removed by the assurance they received from Dr. Coke, that he would not
   again interpose his authority while at a distance from them, in
   altering the time for holding their conferences; or when here, of
   stationing the preachers without the concurrence of Bishop Asbury.

   [24] For the clearing up of all these difficulties, and the vindication
   of Bishop Asbury, see Original Church of Christ, p. 143.

   [25] It is presumed that this alludes to the Cokesbury College, as it
   is not known to the writer that any other seminary or learning, under
   the patronage of the Methodist Episcopal Church, was then in existence.

   [26] There is an error in the printed minutes for this year of 12,884
   in the aggregate number of the whites, which is there stated to be
   63,269. This error originated from adding the number of the colored to
   the whites, and at the same time retaining the number of the colored in
   a separate column.

CHAPTER 3

    An Account of the several Annual Conferences, and of the General Conference
    of 1792.

   There were no less than eighteen annual conferences held this year, the
   particulars of which, however, it seem unnecessary to notice, except
   that the following new circuits were added: Scoperlong and Trent, in
   North Carolina; Highco, in the south; Oconee and Elbert, in Georgia;
   Staten Island and Tioga, in New York; Needham in Massachusetts;
   Providence, in Rhode Island; Cataraqua and Oswegotchie, in Upper
   Canada.

   The above-mentioned eighteen conferences were attended by Bishop Asbury
   in about eight months, during which time he traveled through most of
   the states in the Union, preaching, as usual, almost every day, and
   suffering many hardships: but in the midst of all, he rejoiced in
   beholding the extension of the work of God in many places.

   This year he passed into the state of Tennessee, and preached to the
   people in that newly settled country. And as this is the first account
   we have of the introduction of Methodism into that country, it seems
   proper to give some account of its early settlement.

   The earliest settlements made in Tennessee were about 1770, by
   emigrants from North Carolina and Virginia; and the country was
   considered a part of the former state until the year 1790, when it was
   erected by congress into the "Territory south of Ohio;" and in 1795,
   Tennessee was admitted into the Union as one of the federal states.

   As to the general state of religion and morals at the time the
   Methodist preachers first visited Tennessee, our information is very
   imperfect. It is to be presumed, however, that, as in most new
   countries, the means of grace were within the reach of but few, and
   that those hardy adventurers who first peopled the wilderness of this
   new territory were chiefly actuated by a desire to enlarge their
   earthly possessions, and not, like the pilgrims who first settled New
   England, to insure religious privileges, as these were fully enjoyed at
   home. Some idea, however, may be had, of the general state of society
   from the fact, that the tour of Bishop Asbury through the wilderness
   was in company with a guard, and amid "confused accounts of Indians,"
   who, they feared, would intercept their path; and the following extract
   from his Journal, giving an account of his entrance from Tennessee into
   the state of Kentucky, will show some of the hardships which he and
   others had to undergo while carrying the "glad tidings of salvation"
   into this wilderness, and likewise exhibit some of the honors conferred
   upon this "strutting bishop," as some of his heartless revilers have
   called him. He says, --

   "Wednesday 5. This morning we again swam the river," (namely, Laurel
   River,) "and the west fork thereof. My little horse was ready to fail.
   I was steeped with water up to the waist. About 7 o'clock, with hard
   pushing, we reached the Crab Orchard. How much I have suffered in this
   journey is only known to God and myself. What added much to its
   disagreeableness was the extreme filthiness of the houses."

   Again he says, under date of May 1, --

   "An alarm was spreading of a depredation committed by the Indians on
   the east and west frontiers of the settlements; in the former, report
   says, one man was killed; in the latter, many men, women, and children;
   every thing is in motion. There having been so many about me at
   conference, my rest was much broken I hoped to repair it, and get
   refreshed before I set out to return through the wilderness, but the
   continual arrival of people until midnight, the barking of dogs, and
   other annoyances prevented. Next night we reached Crab Orchard, where
   thirty or forty people were compelled to crowd into one mean house. We
   could get no more rest here than we did in the wilderness. We came the
   old way by Scagg's Creek and Rock Castle, supposing it to be safer, as
   it is a road less frequented, and therefore less liable to be waylaid
   by the savages. My body by this time was well tried. I had a violent
   fever and pain in my head; and I stretched myself on the cold ground,
   and borrowing clothes to keep me warm, by the mercy of God, I slept for
   five hours. Next morning we set off early, and passed beyond Richland
   Creek. Here we were in danger, if anywhere. I could have slept, but was
   afraid. Seeing the drowsiness of the company, I walked the encampment,
   and watched the sentries the whole night. Early next morning we made
   our way to Robinson's Station. We had the best company I ever met with
   -- thirty-six good travelers and a few warriors; but we had a
   packhorse, some old men, and two tired horses." He adds: -- "Through
   infinite mercy we came safe:" and then he exclaims, "Rest, poor house
   of clay from such exertions! Return, O my soul, to thy rest!"

   Let the present race of Methodist preachers and missionaries look at
   this picture, and learn from it how the fields were won by such veteran
   soldiers of the cross.

   Having performed this journey through these newly settled countries, he
   returned to the older states, and attended the several conferences, as
   before stated, preparatory to the General Conference, which met in the
   city of Baltimore.

   At these conferences, two preachers, namely, Beverly Allen [27] and
   Andrew Harpending were expelled from the Church for immoral conduct.
   Thomas Weatherford, Peter Massie, and George Browning had died in
   peace. Fourteen were located The work of God was generally prosperous,
   though the increase was not so large as in some former years, as may be
   seen by the following statement: --

   Numbers in the Church: Whites This year, 52,109, Last year, 50,385;
   Increase 1,724; Colored This year, 13,871, Last year, 12,884; Increase,
   987; Total This year, 65,980, Last year, 63,269; Increase, 2,711;
   Preachers This year, 266, Last year, 250; Increase, 16.

   General Conference of 1792

   As has been seen in the preceding pages, the general affairs of the
   Church had been conducted heretofore chiefly in the several annual
   conferences, which were considered only as so many parts of the whole
   body; for nothing was allowed binding upon all unless it were approved
   of by each and every of these separate conferences. It is true, that
   the Christmas conference of 1784, at which the Church was organized,
   was considered a general conference, because all the preachers were
   invited to attend, for the transaction of the important business then
   and there to be submitted to them; and therefore the acts and doings of
   that conference were considered to be binding upon the whole Church. As
   the work continually increased and spread over such a large and
   extended territory, it was found impracticable for all the preachers to
   assemble annually in one place, without too great a consumption of time
   and expense; and hence the practice which had been adopted of
   appointing several conferences in the same year in different parts of
   the country, for the convenience of both the bishop and the preachers;
   but as one of these conferences could not make laws for all the rest,
   nor yet all the rest for that one without its consent; and as it was
   not likely that so many independent bodies could be brought to
   harmonize in all things pertaining to the welfare of the Church; there
   was danger from this state of things of a dissolution of the body, and
   the establishment of a number of separate and distinct communities,
   acting independently of each other.

   To prevent evils of this character, and to create a center of union to
   the entire body, the council had been instituted; but this unpopular
   measure, not answering the end of its organization, was by general
   consent dissolved, and a General Conference called in its place. This
   was, it seems, agreed upon by the several annual conferences which had
   been held this year.

   This conference assembled in the city of Baltimore on the first day of
   November, 1792, and was composed of all the traveling preachers who had
   been received into full connection. As this was considered the first
   regular General Conference, and as those who composed it came together
   under an expectation that very important matters would be transacted,
   it seems proper to give a particular account of their acts and doings.
   Dr. Coke had returned from Europe, and presided, conjointly with Bishop
   Asbury, over their deliberations.

   As there were no restrictions upon the powers of this conference, the
   entire Discipline of the Church came up for review and revision; but to
   prevent, as far as possible, any improper innovation upon existing
   rules, or the premature adoption of new regulations, they agreed that
   "it shall take two-thirds of all the members of the conference to make
   any new rule, or abolish an old one; but a majority may alter or amend
   any rule."

   They soon had an opportunity to try the strength of this rule in
   preserving them from an innovation upon established usage, in respect
   to the power of stationing the preachers. With a view to keep up the
   itinerancy through the medium of an efficient general superintendency
   it had been established at the Christmas conference, and incorporated
   as a rule of Discipline, that the power of appointing the preachers to
   their several stations should be invested in the bishops. With this
   some had become dissatisfied; and at this conference the Rev. James
   O'Kelly, a very popular preacher in the state of Virginia, who had
   acted as a presiding elder in that district for several years, brought
   forward the following resolution: --

   "After the bishop appoints the preachers at the conference to their
   several circuits, if any one think himself injured by the appointment,
   he shall have liberty to appeal to the conference and state his
   objections; and if the conference approve his objections, the bishop
   shall appoint him to another circuit."

   This resolution elicited a very strong debate, which lasted for about
   three days, and was finally lost by a large majority. This gave great
   dissatisfaction to the mover and some of his particular friends, and
   the next morning he sent a letter to the conference, informing them
   that he could no longer hold his seat among them, because his appeal
   was rejected. With a view to remove his objections, and reconcile him
   to the present order of things, a committee was appointed by the
   conference to confer with Mr. O'Kelly and his partisans; but their
   labors were ineffectual, and they withdrew from the Church, and soon
   began to adopt measures for establishing a separate party.

   During the discussion which arose on the above resolution, as it
   necessarily brought up questions in which the character and conduct of
   Bishop Asbury were deeply involved, with a view to leave the members of
   the conference at full liberty to speak their sentiments without
   restraint, the bishop withdrew from the conference room, and sent them
   the following note: --

   "My Dear Brethren, -- Let my absence give you no pain: Dr. Coke
   presides. I am happily excused from assisting to make laws by which
   myself am to be governed: I have only to obey and execute. I am happy
   in the consideration that I never stationed a preacher through enmity
   or as a punishment. I have acted for the glory of God, and the good of
   the people, and to promote the usefulness of the preachers. Are you
   sure that if you please your selves, that the people will be as fully
   satisfied? They often say, Let us have such a preacher,' and sometimes,
   We will not have such a preacher -- we will sooner pay him to stay at
   home.' Perhaps I must say, His appeal forced him upon you.' I am one --
   ye are many. I am as willing to serve you as ever. I want not to sit in
   any man's way. I scorn to solicit votes. I am a very trembling, poor
   creature, to hear praise or dispraise. Speak your minds freely; but
   remember, you are only making laws for the present time. It may be,
   that as in some other things, so in this: a future day may give you
   further light. I am yours, &c.,

   "Francis Asbury. " [28]

   As the secession of Mr. O'Kelly from the Methodist Episcopal Church was
   the first of any considerable magnitude which had happened, I shall,
   after having completed the account of the doings of the conference,
   endeavor to place it fully before the reader, together with its effects
   upon the Church, as well as upon himself and his party.

   As before said, this conference entered into a full review of the
   doctrine and Discipline of the Church, altering some old, and
   introducing several new regulations, some of the most important of
   which I shall notice. The following was made respecting the selection,
   consecration, and trial of a bishop: --

   "Question How is a bishop to be constituted in future?

   "Answers By the election of the General Conference, and the laying on
   of the hands of three bishops, or at least of one bishop and two
   elders.

   "Question If by death, expulsion, or otherwise, there be no bishop
   remaining in our Church, what shall we do?

   "Answers The General Conference shall elect a bishop, the elders, or
   any three of them, that shall be appointed by the General Conference
   for that purpose, shall ordain him according to our office of
   ordination.

   "Question To whom is the bishop amenable for his conduct?

   "Answers To the General Conference, who have power to expel him for
   improper conduct, if they see it necessary.

   "Question What provision shall be made for the trial of an immoral
   bishop, in the intervals of the General Conference?

   "Answers If the bishop be guilty of immorality, three traveling elders
   shall call upon him, and examine him on the subject; and if the three
   elders verily believe that the bishop is guilty of the crime, they
   shall call to their aid two presiding elders from two districts in the
   neighborhood of that where the crime was committed, each of which
   presiding elder shall bring with him two elders, or an elder and a
   deacon. The above-mentioned nine persons shall form a conference to
   examine into the charges brought against the bishop; and if two-thirds
   of them verily believe him to be guilty of the crime laid to his
   charge, they shall have authority to suspend the bishop until the
   ensuing General Conference."

   Though a number of circuits had been given in charge to an elder, from
   the time of the organization in 1784, yet this had been done chiefly by
   the authority of the general superintendency, without any express
   enactment of the General Conference -- it was a usage which grew out of
   the exigencies of the case, the circumstances of the country, and the
   paucity of ordained ministers. As some had objected to this usage, and
   expressed doubts respecting the authority of the bishop to make such
   appointments, the present conference authorized the appointment of
   presiding elders by the bishop, who should change them at pleasure,
   provided, nevertheless, that he should "not allow an elder to preside
   in the same district more than four years successively;" and he was to
   receive his support out of any surplus money which might be found on a
   circuit, or if there were no surplus, he was to take his proportion
   with the several preachers on his district. For the particular duties
   of a presiding elder, see chap. i, sec. 5, of the Discipline.

   Though temporary provision had been made for the wives of traveling
   preachers, yet until this conference no express rule existed giving
   them a claim upon the funds of the Church. A rule was now passed
   allowing the wife an equal claim with her husband, namely, "sixty-four
   dollars annually," the nominal amount which had been allowed to a
   traveling preacher, besides his traveling expenses.

   It seems that heretofore the preachers had not been in the habit, nor
   was it considered lawful, to receive any thing for performing the
   marriage ceremony; but this prohibition was removed out of the way at
   this conference, by allowing them to receive whatever might be offered
   them by those whom they joined in matrimony.

   The former usage respecting marriage fees, as well as the following
   question and answer, which were adopted at this conference; shows how
   exceedingly scrupulous were our fathers in the church on the subject of
   compensation for preaching the gospel; and if they deserve censure for
   any thing, we might feel disposed to administer a gentle rebuke for
   carrying self-sacrifice to such unreasonable, and, as is thought,
   unscriptural lengths; for it seems to have led the people to believe
   that their ministers should hardly "live by the gospel," or "those
   which wait at the altar should" not be "partakers with the altar."

   "Question What plan shall we pursue in appropriating the money received
   by our traveling ministers for marriage fees?

   "Answers In all the circuits where the preachers do not receive their
   full quarterage, let all such money be given into the hands of the
   stewards, and be equally divided between the traveling preachers of the
   circuit. In all other cases the money shall be disposed of at the
   discretion of the district conferences."

   And at the close of the section the following paragraph was added,
   which, however, has long since ceased to be a rule: --

   "No minister or preacher shall receive any money for deficiencies, or
   on any other account, out of any of our funds or collections, without
   first giving an exact account of all the money, clothes, and other
   presents of every kind, which he has received the preceding year."

   Though this rule was made with the very laudable desire to reduce all
   to as equal a level as possible, and thereby to prevent jealousies
   which might arise from one being more highly honored than another in
   pecuniary matters, it was soon found to have an unfavorable bearing in
   many respects; and as before said, was finally, and with good reason,
   erased from the Discipline.

   With a view to prevent impositions, from unworthy persons obtruding
   themselves into societies where they were not known, the following
   advice was given to all who had the charge of circuits: --

   "To warn all, from time to time, that none are to remove from one
   circuit to another, without a recommendation from a preacher of the
   circuit in these words: -- A. B., the bearer, has been an acceptable
   member in C., and to inform them that without such a certificate they
   will not be received into other societies."

   This is a standing rule in the Discipline.

   The rule respecting the method of settling disputes which might arise
   between brethren "concerning the payment of debts," was adopted at this
   time and afterward modified from time to time, until at the first
   delegated conference, which sat in the city of New York, in 1812, it
   was made as it now stands in the Discipline, chap. i, sec. 9. There can
   be no doubt but that this regulation has had a most happy effect in
   preventing expensive lawsuits and all those litigations in reference to
   matters which engender strife and alienate affection.

   The section regulating the "method by which immoral traveling ministers
   or preachers shall be brought to trial, found guilty, and reproved or
   suspended, in the intervals of the conferences," was considerably
   modified at this conference; but it had been altered and amended from
   one General Conference to another, until 1836, when it was so amended
   as to read as it now stands in the Discipline, chap. i, sec. 18.

   The resolution not to "receive a present for administering baptism, or
   for burying the dead," was passed at this conference; and it remained
   unaltered until 1828, when the words "receive a present" were exchanged
   for "make a charge." See chap. i, sec. 21.

   The twenty-second section of the same chapter, relating to the manner
   of conducting public worship, was incorporated in the Discipline, and
   the twenty-fourth section of the same chapter so modified as to
   discourage the use of fugue tunes, and the attending of singing schools
   not under our direction.

   As provision had been made for supernumerary preachers, the conference
   appended the following explanatory note respecting the character of
   such: --

   "A supernumerary preacher is one so worn out in the itinerant service
   as to be rendered incapable of preaching constantly; but at the same
   time is willing to do any work in the ministry which the conference may
   direct, and his strength will enable him to perform."

   Before the conference adjourned, they passed a resolution to have
   another General Conference at the end of four years, to be convened in
   the city of Baltimore, November 1, 1796, and that it should be composed
   of all the traveling preachers who should be in full connection at the
   time it was to be held.

   It was very manifest from what had taken place at this conference, and
   especially from the temper and conduct of Mr. O'Kelly and his
   partisans, that a spirit of insubordination was abroad, and that a
   division of the body would be likely to result from an improper
   indulgence in speaking against the constituted authorities of the
   Church. To prevent, as far as practicable, the evils naturally
   resulting from the course of conduct to be apprehended from those
   dissentient brethren, and such as they might influence to a spirit of
   opposition, the conference very opportunely passed the following rule:
   --

   If a member of our Church shall be clearly convicted of endeavoring to
   sow dissensions in any of our societies, by inveighing against either
   our doctrine or discipline, such person so offending shall be first
   reproved by the senior preacher of his circuit; and if he afterward
   persist in such pernicious practices, he shall be expelled the
   society."

   This leads us to notice now more particularly the secession of Mr.
   O'Kelly, and the effects it produced upon the cause of religion
   generally in that part of the country where he more especially
   operated, and finally upon himself and his adherents. It has already
   been remarked that Mr. O'Kelly was a very popular preacher, of
   considerable age and standing in the Church, had acquired great
   influence in Virginia, and particularly over the minds of the younger
   preachers in his district.

   The reasons which induced him to withdraw from the Church have been
   before stated. Mr. Lee says, that while he stood and looked at the old
   man as he took his departure from Baltimore, he felt persuaded that he
   would not long be idle, but would endeavor to put himself at the head
   of a party, which, indeed, soon came to pass. Mr. Lee moreover says,
   that a preacher informed him that O'Kelly denied the doctrine of the
   Trinity, as held by us; and that it was his intention to have had
   O'Kelly tried at the conference for preaching false doctrine; and
   therefore he believed that one cause of his leaving the connection was
   a fear of being censured for his anti-Methodistical views in respect to
   this doctrine. However this may be, he soon raised a cry against the
   Church he had left, and poured forth his anathemas more particularly
   upon the head of Bishop Asbury, whose power in stationing the preachers
   he had so violently opposed. To these complaints Bishop Asbury replies,
   in his sententious style as follows: --

   "I bid such adieu, and appeal to the bar of God. I have no time to
   contend, having better work to do. If we lose some children, God will
   give us more. Ah! this is the mercy, the justice of some, who, under
   God, owe their all to me and my tyrants, so called. The Lord judge
   between them and me."

   After Mr. O'Kelly set up for himself, he published a pamphlet, the
   contents of which it is not necessary at this day to recite, which was
   answered by the Rev. Mr. Snethen, in which the bishop is fully
   vindicated from all the aspersions of his enemies.

   Though all the traveling preachers, except one, who withdrew with
   O'Kelly, returned to the Church, yet there were several local
   preachers, and a considerable number of private members, who became
   warmly attached to him, and they made several efforts to organize
   themselves into a church more in conformity to their notions of
   republican principles, until finally they renounced all creeds and
   confessions, and professed to take the New Testament alone for the role
   of their government, claiming the right, of course, to interpret it
   according to their own views of order and propriety; and as party
   politics ran high in Virginia at that time, they took the popular name
   of "Republican Methodists," with James O'Kelly as their head man.

   In the latter part of the year 1793 they began to form societies on a
   plan which should exclude all superiority of one preacher over another,
   and at the same time promised to the people greater liberties than they
   could enjoy among their old brethren. This popular theme took with
   many, by which means hundreds of the people were induced to forsake the
   Methodist Episcopal Church, and to join the standard of revolt, so that
   in some places whole societies were broken up, and others divided and
   thrown into confusion, taking with them some houses of worship, while
   others were voluntarily left by our preachers, to avoid a thriftless
   contention.

   As Mr. O'Kelly lived in the southern part of Virginia, the spirit of
   disaffection spread among some of the societies in North Carolina,
   infecting a number of local preachers, as well as several societies.
   What rendered this separation more destructive in its effects upon the
   interests of pure religion, was the bitterness of spirit with which it
   was conducted, especially in its hostility to bishops, and, as they
   called them, their servile creatures, the presiding elders -- though
   the leader of the party had himself been a presiding elder for several
   years. Such are the inconsistencies of fanaticism, when impelled on by
   personal animosity.

   This spirit, under the guidance of such minds, could not do otherwise
   than produce disastrous results to the interests of true religion.
   Instead of contending against sin and its pernicious effects, the party
   seemed to exhaust all their powers against episcopacy, and those
   debatable points of church government and economy which have always
   elicited less or more of controversy, and which these disputants were
   least of all likely to set at rest. And this controversy had such an
   effect upon the minds of many who were not under the influence of a
   religious principle that they became deeply prejudiced against all
   religion; and thus the secession was doubtless a means of hardening
   them in their iniquity.

   Finding at length that the title already assumed was not likely to
   answer the purpose intended, Mr. O'Kelly published a pamphlet in 1801,
   in which he called his party "The Christian Church." This device,
   however, did not dissolve the charm by which those deluded men were
   induced to follow their leader, until a happy thought led them to
   conclude that by assuming such a title they proscribed all others from
   the Christian character; and thus becoming startled at their own
   exclusiveness, they began to contend among themselves, and then to
   divide and subdivide; until in a few years scarcely a vestige of them
   was to be found in all Virginia. So ended this secession from the
   Methodist Episcopal Church, which began in the obstinate attachment of
   a vain man to his favorite theory, and ended in the entire overthrow of
   his power and popularity, and carried along with it, as is greatly to
   be feared, many to destruction. But what were its effects upon the
   prime leader of the revolt? Though he succeeded for a time to draw off
   disciples after him, and to excite a deep-rooted prejudice against the
   General Conference and Bishop Asbury, he gradually declined in power
   and influence, lost the confidence and affection of the people
   generally, and finally died in comparative obscurity, leaving behind
   him a sad picture of human infirmity, and a melancholy evidence of the
   pernicious effects of cleaving so obstinately to a theory which, right
   or wrong, is condemned as inexpedient by a majority of the good men
   with whom he may be associated. As, however, Bishop Asbury bore such a
   conspicuous part in this controversy, and was made the butt of so many
   abusive epithets, it is pleasant to witness the Christian disposition
   he manifested toward his fallen antagonist near the close of Mr.
   O'Kelly's life. Under date of Friday, August 20, 1802, he says, --

   "Mr. O'Kelly having been taken ill in town," (that is, the town of
   Winchester, Va.,) "I sent two of our brethren, Reed and Wells, to see
   him, by whom I signified to him that if he wished to see me, I would
   wait on him: he desired a visit, which I made him on Monday, August 23.
   We met in peace, asked of each other's welfare, talked of persons and
   things indifferently, prayed, and parted in peace. Not a word was said
   of the troubles of former times. Perhaps this is the last interview we
   shall have upon earth."

   It is to be hoped, therefore, from the manner in which this interview
   was sought and obtained, conducted and ended, that ere death separated
   them, old differences and animosities were forgotten, and that the God
   of mercy extended that mercy to Mr. O'Kelley which they, as is
   presumed, extended to each other, and that he now rests where his
   "iniquities are forgotten and his sins covered."

   It may be proper to remark, however, that it was a long time before the
   societies in Virginia fully recovered from the deleterious effects of
   this secession. The spirits of many were exasperated against each
   other, brotherly love was greatly diminished, and as a consequence
   necessarily resulting from this state of things, the influence of the
   Church upon the public mind was much weakened and circumscribed, and
   the preaching of the gospel under these circumstances was not attended
   with its wonted effects. By a steady perseverance, however, these sad
   results of a pertinacious adherence to a favorite theory gradually
   subsided; and the cause of God, as proposed and advocated by the
   Methodist ministry, has since greatly prospered in that part of the
   country.

   A few remarks will close the present volume.

   Methodism had now existed in this country about thirty-six years, and
   numbered in its communion, including preachers and people, white and
   colored, sixty-six thousand, two hundred and forty-six souls. The
   entire population of the United Stales at that time was about four
   millions; if we allow three minors and others, who attended upon public
   worship among them, to each communicant, the population of the
   Methodist Episcopal Church would amount to about one hundred and
   ninety-eight thousand. According to the this estimation, about
   one-twentieth part of the entire population were brought under
   Methodist influence in the short space of thirty-six years. This, it
   should he remembered, had been effected from nothing, that is, we had
   no church members with whom to begin, except the few solitary emigrants
   from Ireland, as noted in the second chapter of this work.

   In this respect our circumstances were different from all the principal
   denominations in the country. From the very beginning of the
   settlements, the members of the English Church, the Presbyterians,
   Congregationalists, Dutch Reformed, Lutherans, and the Baptists were
   here established, some of them in some of the colonies by law, and in
   others in conformity to the ecclesiastical organizations in the
   respective countries whence they came. They were, therefore, all here
   before us, peaceably enjoying all their immunities, civil and
   religious. Whereas when the Methodists arrived they had to begin every
   thing anew, and to contend with all sorts of opposition, and to work
   their way unaided by any human power, except so far as they were
   favored by those, from time to time, who were convinced of the truth of
   their doctrine, and the Scriptural character of their economy.

   From these facts it is easy to perceive the vast advantages, so far as
   mere human agency is concerned, those denominations possessed over the
   Methodists. Those biases arising from religious habits, from education,
   and from legal protection, were all in their favor. The seminaries of
   learning, high and low, were under their control, and all the civil
   offices were filled by men belonging either to some one of these
   denominations, or from among those who had their religion yet to
   choose, or by such as were biased by infidel principles. And, moreover,
   for a period of eighteen years, which includes just one half the time
   we had had an existence here, the Methodists were but a society, and
   consequently were dependent upon other denominations for the ordinances
   of baptism and the Lord's supper. Yet, under all these disadvantages,
   they prospered abundantly, increased in number and strength, and had
   spread themselves over the length and breadth of the land.

   Now the question which forces itself upon us is, To what were they
   indebted for this unexampled prosperity? It cannot be attributed to the
   influence they possessed over the public mind -- for, in fact, they had
   none, only so far as it was gained in the midst of obloquy and
   opposition, as their doctrine, character, and labors became gradually
   known to the people.

   Neither can it be attributed to their learning or profound knowledge.
   Though their founders were both able and learned, yet the first
   missionaries who came to this country, though men of sound
   understanding and well read in the sacred Scriptures, were by no means
   learned, according to the common acceptation of that word; and as to
   those who were, from time to time, raised up here, some of them hardly
   understood their mother tongue correctly, and but few could boast of
   any thing more than a common English education. While they were men of
   strong common sense and sound judgment, and some of them possessed a
   great flow of natural eloquence, yet, having been taken chiefly from
   the common walks of life, they enjoyed none of those qualifications
   which arise from a classical and scientific course of study. They were,
   however, "mighty in the Scriptures," "full of faith and the Holy
   Ghost," and "needed not that any one should teach them which be the
   first principles of Christ," for they could call "him Christ by the
   Holy Spirit," having received the "witness in themselves that they were
   born of God."

   These facts force us to the conclusion that their prosperity must be
   attributed to the blessing of God upon their labors. They, in fact,
   encountered a host of opposers. The entire religious community, as well
   as the vicious rabble and the infidel part of the community, were
   arrayed against them. The prejudices of education, of sectarianism, of
   the depravity of unregenerate sinners, and the rivalry of
   denominational jealousy, were in hostility to the progress of
   Methodism. Yet, in spite of all this mighty phalanx of opposing forces,
   it won its way among the people, converting thousands to its standard.
   We therefore say again, that its forward course can be accounted for
   only by supposing the sanction of the most high God upon their labors.

   But will God give his sanction to bad men? Surely he will not. Those
   men, therefore, who were engaged in this cause were eminently holy and
   good. They professed to have an experience of divine things upon the
   heart, and to be moved by the Holy Ghost to this work. They spoke
   therefore of the things which they had felt and seen, and God bore
   testimony to their word. Instead of amusing the people with mere
   speculative truths, they addressed themselves directly to the heart,
   aiming, above all other things, to effect a radical reformation there,
   knowing full well that a reformation of life would necessarily follow.
   It was this mode of preaching which gave such success to their efforts,
   and inspired the confidence of those who had an experimental knowledge
   of divine things.

   It has been said that God gave his sanction to their labors. We do not
   wish to be misunderstood upon this subject. We do not infer the
   blessing of God upon the labors of a ministry merely because proselytes
   are made. Mohammed made proselytes to his false religion by the power
   of the sword faster than Jesus Christ did by the power of his miracles
   and the purity of his doctrine. And any impostor, or mere formal
   minister, by the fascinating charms of his eloquence, or the cunning
   artifices to which he will resort, may succeed in proselytizing others
   to his party without at all benefiting their souls, or reforming their
   lives. The mere multiplication of converts to a system is no proof of
   itself that it has the sanction of the God of truth and love.

   We have not, therefore, enumerated the communicants of the Methodist
   Episcopal Church as an evidence, of itself, that its ministry were
   moving in obedience to God's will, and in the order of his providence.
   Though they had been as "numerous as the sands upon the seashore," had
   they been destitute of righteousness, they would be no proof that the
   instruments of their conversion were sent of God.

   But what we insist upon is, that these men preached the pure doctrine
   of Jesus Christ, and that those who were converted by their
   instrumentality were really "brought from darkness to light, and from
   the power of Satan to God" -- that such a reformation of heart and life
   was effected as resulted in a uniform obedience to the commands of God;
   and that those who were brought under the doctrine and disciplinary
   regulations of this Church, brought forth the "fruit of the Spirit,
   love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
   meekness, temperance" -- thus giving evidence that they were indeed
   "born of the Spirit," and enjoyed His witness of their adoption into
   the family of God.

   We speak of them as a body. Though it is not probable that there were
   many hypocrites who came among them -- there being no temptation to
   such to identify themselves with them -- yet there were doubtless some
   such, and others who imposed upon themselves and others; and some who
   apostatized from the faith -- these could not do otherwise than
   reproach the cause they had espoused. But whenever such were
   discovered, if they could not he reclaimed from their wanderings, the
   strict discipline which was enforced cut them off from the communion of
   the faithful; and thus was the Church freed from the responsibility of
   their conduct, and kept pure from their corrupting example. By this
   faithful preaching of the word, and enforcement of discipline, the main
   body was kept in a healthy state, and presented a living example of the
   purity and excellence of their religion. This was a resistless argument
   in their favor.

   Another thing which made them more extensively useful was, their
   itinerating mode of preaching the gospel. Had these ministers confined
   their labors to insulated congregations, as most of the ministers of
   other denominations did, they never could have realized that diffusive
   spread of evangelical religion which actually accompanied their
   efforts. Had John Wesley, instead of going forth into the "highways and
   hedges" to call sinners to repentance, settled himself over a parish,
   Methodism had been either "hid in a corner," or never have had an
   existence. It was his itinerating so largely, and preaching wherever he
   could find access to the people, which gave such efficiency to his
   efforts, and such a wide spread to the gospel by his instrumentality.

   But in this country especially, many parts of which were newly settled,
   and therefore but sparsely populated, had not those preachers carried
   the gospel to the people by traversing the country, they had remained
   destitute of the means of salvation. We may, therefore, attribute the
   success which attended their labors to the blessing of God on an
   itinerant ministry -- on a ministry which went everywhere preaching,
   "not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in the demonstration of
   the Spirit, and with power." This it was which enabled them to "reach
   even beyond themselves," in preaching the gospel of Christ, and of
   gathering thousands of souls into his fold.

   These men devoted themselves entirely and exclusively to this work,
   remembering, as their Discipline admonished them, that it was "not
   their business to preach so many times, and to take care of this or
   that society, but to save as many souls as possible; to bring as many
   sinners as they can to repentance, and with all their power to build
   them up in holiness, "without which they cannot see the Lord." It was
   this diligence in their calling, of being in soul and body devoted to
   it, which enabled them to accomplish so much in so short a time, and
   that, too, in the midst of reproach and opposition.

   It was, indeed, this very devotion, this diligence, these zealous
   efforts in the cause of their divine Master, which provoked much of the
   opposition which they had to encounter. The lukewarm clergy were
   aroused to indignation at seeing themselves rivaled by those whom they
   affected to despise on account of their erratic habits and inferiority
   in point of literature and science. And as these zealous itinerants
   made their pointed appeals to the consciences of sinners, denounced the
   just judgments of God upon hardened offenders, their ire was often
   kindled against those who thus "reproved them in the gate." Wherever
   these flaming messengers of Jesus Christ came, they disturbed the false
   peace of the lukewarm, awakened the conscience of the sleeping sinner,
   and gave him no rest until he surrendered his heart to Christ. They not
   only "preached in the great congregation" "in the city full," but "into
   whatever house they entered," they addressed themselves personally to
   its inmates, urging them to be "reconciled to God;" and they
   accompanied all their efforts by earnest prayer, both public and
   private, that God would sanction their labors by sending upon them the
   energies of the Holy Spirit.

   The doctrines, too, which they principally insisted upon, had a direct
   tendency to produce the desired effect upon the heart and life. While
   they held, in common with other orthodox Christians, to the hereditary
   depravity of the human heart, the deity and atonement of Jesus Christ,
   the necessity of repentance and faith; that which they pressed upon
   their hearers with the greatest earnestness was, the necessity of the
   new birth, and the privilege of their having a knowledge, by the
   internal witness of the Holy Spirit, of the forgiveness of sins,
   through, faith in the blood of Christ; and as a necessary consequence
   of this, and as naturally flowing from it, provided they persevered,
   holiness of heart and life. On this topic they dwelt with an emphasis
   and an earnestness peculiar to themselves. The doctrine itself, though
   held by most orthodox churches, as is manifest from their articles of
   faith and formularies of religion, was allowed to sleep in their books,
   or was not brought before the people with that prominence which its
   importance demands, and with that particularity and definiteness which
   its vitality in the Christian system renders essential to the success
   of the gospel ministry.

   But on this vital point the Methodist ministers bent their whole force.
   If they pressed upon the sinner a sense of his depravity and actual
   guilt, it was to make him feel the necessity of repentance and
   forgiveness. If they presented to him the death of Christ, as the
   meritorious cause of the sinner's salvation, it was to encourage him to
   look to that source for pardon in his blood. If the Holy Spirit was
   spoken of as the helper of our infirmities, and as a leader into all
   truth, it was that he might be claimed by the penitent sinner as the
   sealer of his pardon, and as a witnesser of his "acceptance in the
   Beloved." Thus all the doctrines of the gospel were brought to have a
   bearing on this point, that all who were induced to "seek after God"
   might have no rest until they found "redemption in his blood, even the
   forgiveness of sins."

   By preaching this doctrine everywhere, to all classes of people, making
   it prominent in every sermon, and exhibiting it as the common privilege
   of all penitent sinners to experience, they were blessed of God in
   their labors, and rejoiced over returning prodigals to their Father's
   house.

   From all these facts -- and that they are facts is attested by every
   person who is at all acquainted with our history -- we conclude that
   this work was eminently the work of God. Who will say it was not?
   Whoever does this must also say, that men by mere human effort,
   unassisted by the Holy Spirit, may turn more sinners from the error of
   their ways, and bring them into all holy living, than all the clergy in
   the country beside! Or else they must deny that sinners were thus
   converted from the error of their ways. But to deny this, would be to
   fly in the face of the plainest facts on record -- facts attested by
   thousands of witnesses. And to assert the former, that such a
   reformation may be effected by human persuasion alone, is to deny the
   necessity of the gospel to reform sinners from their sinfulness -- it
   is, in fact, saying that the gospel is a "cunningly devised fable,"
   totally unnecessary for the salvation of a lost world. For if sinners
   may be reformed by means of "enticing words of man's wisdom," then may
   we dispense with the gospel, with the blood of Christ, and the energies
   of the Holy Spirit. But as all orthodox Christians acknowledge the
   indispensable necessity of these to renovate the sinner's heart, and to
   make him holy all manner of conversation, it follows most conclusively,
   that the reformation which accompanied the labors of the Methodist
   ministry was the work of God.

   Hence we have a right to infer that, to insure a continuance of his
   sanction upon our future efforts, all we have to do is to "walk by the
   same rule, and mind the same thing." Thus living and working, the same
   benevolent Being who guided, protected, and so abundantly blessed the
   labors of our fathers in the gospel, will not fail to pour upon us and
   our children the blessings of his salvation.

   [27] The end of this unhappy man reads a fearful lesson to all those
   who presume to trifle with sacred things. In the notice we have taken
   of the rise and progress of Methodism in Charleston, South Carolina, we
   have seen that Mr. Allen brought a great reproach upon the Church in
   that place by his apostasy. What the particular sin was by which he
   thus wounded the cause of God, I am not informed; but from a notice of
   him in Bishop Asbury's Journal, vol. ii, page 184, it appears that in
   the bishop's estimation he had been "going from bad to worse for seven
   or eight years," speaking hard things against the bishop among the
   people, and writing to Mr. Wesley and Dr. Coke, and thereby stirring up
   prejudice in their minds, as is presumed, against Bishop Asbury. On
   this account, says the bishop, "I have had my opinion of him these nine
   years, and gave Dr. Coke my thoughts of him before his ordination." It
   seems he was at length arrested and committed to jail for shooting the
   Marshall of the district, Major Forsyth, through the head while the
   Marshall was attempting to serve a writ upon him. This happened two
   years after his expulsion. Of the particulars of his death I have not
   been able to find any account.

   [28] As this question respecting the power if the bishops to appoint
   the preachers to the stations has frequently been agitated in the
   conference, at a suitable time I shall endeavor to state it fully and
   fairly, with the substance of the argument, for and against it, until
   it was finally set at rest in the year 1828.
