Letter to Veranus

  Formulas of Spiritual Intelligence
  Preface

   Eucherius to his son in Christ, Veranus, greetings.

   I believe that you should study diligently these formulae of spiritual
   knowledge, which I have compiled and which I send you. The following
   knowledge is meant to bring the teaching of the divine scriptures
   easily to mind. Because the letter kills and the spirit gives life [II
   Cor. 3:6], it is indispensable that we enter the interior of spiritual
   discourse with a quickening spirit. We remind ourselves and others
   that, in the future, the whole of scripture will be our [mental] dress;
   the old, as well as the new, will be the means to allegorical
   understanding, because as we read in the Old Testament: I will open my
   mouth in parables; I will speak in old mysteries [Ps. 77(78):2], or
   again, as it is written in the New Testament, Jesus spoke all these
   things in parables to the crowds and without parables he would not
   speak to them [Matt. 13:34]. The heavenly talk of the prophets and the
   apostles is not to be wondered at; it is brought forth by prayer, not
   by the usual way that men write. Much will vanish easily if it is
   gotten readily; great things, which are the true thing, held in the
   interior, will be brought together, that the blessed sayings of God
   will be separated from other writings by their worth and type.

   The entire worth of heavenly mysteries is not known indiscriminately
   and randomly, nor is the sacred set before dogs nor pearls before swine
   [Matt. 7:6], because, in truth, like the silver-plated dove whose
   posterior parts shine with the radiance of gold [Ps. 67(68):14(13)], so
   the divine scriptures first shine like silver but glow like gold in
   their hidden parts. Rightly it is so managed, because the purity of
   eloquence is hidden altogether from the promiscuous eyes of the crowd,
   as if it were covered by a garment of modesty. And so, the divine is
   taken care of by the best stewardship; the scriptures themselves
   protect the heavenly mysteries by cloaking them, just as divinity
   itself works in its own mysterious way. Therefore, when in sacred
   books, one finds the eyes of the Lord, the neck of the Lord, the feet,
   and even the long-reaching arms of the Lord, written of--that God, God
   who is invisible, incomprehensible, eternally the same, should be
   limited in body is far from the universal faith of the church--is
   sought, just as He is disclosed, through the Holy Spirit, in the
   exposition of the image.

   Here, we find the interior of the Lord's temple, here the holy of
   holies. The body, therefore, is the sacred scripture, as it has come
   down to us, as it is in letters, with the soul of moral sense, which is
   uttered in figures of speech, with the spirit of superior
   understanding, which names by analogy. How the pattern is found in the
   three-fold nature of the scriptures! The sanctifying confession of the
   Trinity preserves us through all things so that our spirit, our mind,
   and our body are irreproachably one, in the coming and justice of our
   Lord and God, Jesus Christ, whom we serve [I Thes. 5:23].

   The wisdom of the world divides its philosophy into three parts:
   physics, ethics, and logic, that is, natural, moral, and rational.
   Natural pertains to the causes of nature, which the universe holds;
   moral pertains to truth, which it sees as custom; rational pertains to
   the disputes about elevated things that God, who is the Father of all,
   has proven. Indeed, this differentiation is not dissimilar to our
   three-fold method of teaching, by which the heavenly scriptures are
   taught as philosophy, according to history, according to rhetoric,
   according to analogy, to whose who think otherwise.

   History, for this reason, instills in us the truth of deeds or faith in
   reporting. Rhetoric takes the mind mysteriously back to the correction
   of life. Analogy leads secretly to the heavenly figures. There are
   those who think that allegory is thrown in the fourth place in the
   class of knowledge, and they would confirm this by foreshadowing of
   future deeds in stories. Here, in truth, are many similar examples made
   manifest: the heaven which we contemplate here is close to history; the
   life of the heavenly is close to rhetoric; baptism of water is close to
   allegory; the angels are close to analogy. It is everywhere: and the
   waters above the heavens praise the Lord [Ps. 148:4]. All the
   discipline of our religion emanated from that fountain of increased
   knowledge: they call the first practice in accordance with
   understanding, that is, reality and contemplation. One fullfills his
   real life in the correction of his habits; another steeps himself in
   contemplation of the heavenly and discussion of divine scripture. Real
   knowledge, therefore, is spread from various sources. Contemplation,
   moreover, is derived in two parts, that is, it consists in historical
   discourse and in understanding spiritual knowledge. But now, let us put
   forth the clear formulas of spiritual knowledge, which we have
   promised, putting the usually accepted forms of each name with the
   associated text of divine reading. Let us pray thus to the Lord that He
   will open the closed passages of scripture and that we may offer these,
   by which the hidden may be known to our mind:

   Book I: The Members of the Lord

   Book II: On Heavenly Objects

   Book III: On Earthly Things

   Book IV: On the Animals

   Book V: On the Various Names and Titles

   Book VI: On the Interior Man

   Book VII: On the Useful or the Ordinary

   Book VIII: On the Various Meanings of Words and Names

   Book IX: On Jerusalem and her Enemies

   Book X: On Numbers

   And so, as he who will present a gift to the Lord, let us, therefore,
   explicate now these meanings of names and words, in accordance with
   those which are most justly called allegory.
     __________________________________________________________________

I. The Members of the Lord: Their Names and Significance

   the psalm: they have seen your footsteps, O Lord. [Ps. 67(68):25(24)
   Vulgate]

   The arms of the Lord are a help to his saints; in the psalm: take up
   arms and a shield. [Ps. 34(35):2]

   The protection of the Lord is a shield; in the psalm: O Lord, you have
   crowned us with the shield of your goodwill. [Ps. 5:12]

   The vengeance of the Lord is a spear; in the psalm: hurl your spear and
   put an end to the impious. [Ps. 34(35):3]

   The tension of divine threat is a bow; in the psalm: he has stretched
   his bow and prepared it. [Ps. 7:13(12)]

   The precepts of the Lord or of the Apostles are arrows; in the psalm:
   he has sent his arrows and has scattered them. [Ps. 17(18):15(14)]

   The discourse of the Lord is a vindicating sword; in the apostle: the
   discourse of the Lord is living, and it is as efficacious and
   penetrating as a two-edged sword. [Hebr. 4:12]

   The discourse of the Lord is also a javelin.

   The trumpet of God is the voice of the Lord made manifest; in the
   apostle: in te command and voice of the archangel and in the trumpet of
   God. [I Thess. 4:15]

   The chariot of the Lord, the seat of the Lord, is the four-sided
   gospel; in the psalm: the chariot of the Lord has 20,000 sides. [Ps.
   67(68):18(17)]

   The rod of the Lord is a sign of his rule or of the correction of
   discipline; in the psalm: the rod of equity, the rod of your reign.
   [Ps. 44(45):7(6)]

   The staff of the Lord is the sustaining consolation of God; in the
   psalm: your rod and your staff, they comfort me. [Ps. 22(23):4]

   psalm: with the embers of the desolate. [Ps. 119(120):4 Vulgate]

   Smoke is the beginning of future contrition or of a threat from God; in
   the psalm: smoke rises in his anger. The same in another part: like
   noxious smoke in the eyes, it is vanity. [Ps. 17(18):9(8);
   unidentified]

   Fire is the Holy Spirit; in the acts of the apostles: and fire appeared
   to them in forked tongues and sat above each of them, and they were
   filled with the Holy Spirit. [Acts 2:3-4]
     __________________________________________________________________

II. On Heavenly Objects

   The heavens are the apostles or the saints, the same where the Lord
   dwells; in the psalm: The heavens tell the glory of the Lord. [Ps.
   18(19):2(1)]

   The clouds are the prophets and the saints, which rain the word of the
   Lord; in Isaiah: I shall order the clouds above to rain. [Is. 5:6]

   The thunder is the voice of the evangelists, which sound in the sky; in
   the psalm: The voice of the thunder in the heaven. [Ps. 76(77):19(18)
   Vulgate]

   The lightning is the splendor of the evangelists; in the psalm: Your
   lightning lights the globe of the earth. [Ps. 76(77):19(18)]

   The lightning is the strength of the word of Jesus Christ; in the
   psalm: the lightning multiplied and disturbed them. [Ps. 17(18):15(14)]

   The angelic thrones, like the saints, are themselves the power of Your
   rule; in the psalm: Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever; the same
   in another part about the devil: I place my throne in the north wind.
   [Ps. 44(45):7(6); Is. 14:13]

   The angels and the saints are the seat of the One Who is Above, because
   the Lord sits on them; in the psalm: The Lord sits above the seat of
   His saints. [Ps. 46(47):9(8) Vulgate]

   The sun is Lord Jesus Christ, who shines on the earth; in Solomon:
   therefore, the sun of justice does not shine on us. [Wis. 5:6]

   The moon is the church, which is resplendent in the night of this
   world; in the psalm: He made the moon for its time. [Ps. 103(104):19]

   The stars are the saints and the learned; in Daniel: the learned shall
   burn like the stars, and the angels will shine as well. [Dan. 12:3]

   The clouds are truly the mysteries of God; in the prophet: and the rain
   the clouds of his feet. [Nah. 1:3]

   The mist is the working of the divine mysteries; in the psalm: and the
   mist is beneath His feet. [Ps. 17(18):10(11)]

   The deep is the profundity of the Scriptures; in the psalm: deep calls
   to deep. [Ps. 41(42):8(7)]

   The dew is the word of God, which moistens the land of men; in the
   psalm: like the dew of Hermon which falls on Mount Sion. [Ps.
   132(133):3]

   The rain is the precepts and decrees of the Lord, which water the land,
   that is, men; in the psalm: O Lord, You separated the plentiful rain
   from Your inheritance. [Ps. 67(68):10(9) Vulgate]

   The snow is the great brightness of justice; in the psalm: You will
   wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. [Ps. 50(51):9(7)]

   The hail is the threats of the Lord, which beat the stubborn; in the
   psalm: hail and the coals of fire. The same in another part: and it
   fell into their vineyard like hail. [Ps. 17(18):13(12); Ps. 77(78):47]

   The hoarfrost is abstinence because through it, the passion of the body
   freezes; in the psalm: I am made like a bottle in the frost. [Ps.
   118(119):83]

   The storm is the force of trial and examination; in the psalm: He who
   saves me made me from a weak soul and a storm. [Ps. 54(55):9(8)
   Vulgate]

   The ice is the hardness of sinners; in Solomon: your sin is dissolved
   like ice in clear weather. [Eccl. 3:17]

   The wind is the breath of the saints; in the psalm: He has flown upon
   the wings of the wind. The same in a bad part in Matthew: And the winds
   blew. [Matt. 7:25]

   The north wind is the devil, or bad, faithless men; in the prophet:
   from the north wind, evil broke out above the earth. [Jer. 1:44]

   The right wind is the same as the north wind; in Solomon: a hard wind
   is from the north. Moreover, it is called by the name right because the
   devil himself assumes that name of good, or because of the right would
   be the west, that is, sin, from his point of view. [Prov. 25:23]

   The south wind is the ardor of faith; in the psalm: like a stream in
   the south. [Ps. 125(126):4 Vulgate]

   The empty air is a messenger; in the apostle: thus, I fight, not
   beating the air, that is, not pursuing emptiness. [1 Cor. 9:26]

   The correct time is the ordering of divine will; in the psalm: he made
   the moon in due season. [Ps. 103(104):19 Vulgate]

   Spring is the renewal of life, as baptism is the renewal of life
   through the resurrection; in the psalm: You have made summer and
   spring. [Ps. 73(74):17]

   Summer is the prefiguration of the joy to come; in the psalm: the same
   as above.

   Winter is persecution and tribulation; in the gospel: let your flight
   be neither in winter nor on the Sabbath. [Matt. 24:20]

   The years are sometimes taken for eternity, thus: your years do not run
   short, for the time being and for the brevity of life, and so: you
   shall meditate upon your years, as if they were like a spider's web.

   Day and night are righteousness and iniquity, faith and infidelity,
   prosperity and adversity; in the psalm: The Lord has shown His mercy by
   day and has declared it in the night. [Ps. 41(42):8]

   Light and darkness are thus taken to be like day and night; in the
   epistle of John: he who loves his brother remains in the light;
   however, he who hates his brother is in darkness. [I John 2:10-11]

   The shade is divine protection; in the psalm: take me under the shadow
   of Your wings. [Ps. 16(17):8]

   The five hundredth hour, which they take to mean years, is said to be
   the number of days allotted to the world in this present age; in the
   letter of John: little children, the last days are here. [I John 2:18]

   The east saves greatly; in Luke: the dayspring has come to us from on
   high; and in Zechariah: behold the man, Orient is his name. [Luke 1:78;
   Zech. 6:12]

   The west is the lessening of a better life; in the prophet: our sun has
   set at midday. [Am. 8:9]

   The morning light is the doing of good, or baptism, or resurrection; in
   the psalm: I shall stand before You in the morning, and I shall see
   You. [Ps. 5:3]

   Midday is the clarity of great teaching and great deeds; in Solomon:
   where do you lie at noon? and in the bad part of the psalm: a demon at
   noon, that is, a demon made manifest. [Cant. 1:6; Ps. 90(91):6 Vulgate]
     __________________________________________________________________

III. On Earthly Things

   The earth is man himself; in the gospel: another has fallen into the
   good earth. The same in a bad part about the sinner: you devour the
   earth all the days of your life. [Mark 4:18; Genesis 3:14]

   The dry lands are the flesh of a fruitless man; in Ecclesiastes, to
   work in a dry land with evil and sorrow. [Ecclesiastes 37:3]

   The dust is a sinner or the vanity of the flesh; in the psalm: like the
   dust, which the wind blows about. [Ps. 1:4 Vulgate]

   The mud is the gluttony of sinners; in the psalm: tear me from the mud
   that I not take root; the same in another part of John: he made mud and
   daubed my eyes. [Ps. 68(69):15 Vulgate; John 9:11]

   The mountains are the church of the lord and of the apostles, or of the
   saints, a strength from on high; in the psalm: which descends from Mt.
   Sion. The same in another part from the prophet: May your feet not
   stumble greatly on the misty mountains, that is, heretics. [Ps.
   132(133):3; Jeremiah 13:16]

   The hills are the saints of lesser merit; in the psalm: mountains and
   all hills. The same in a bad part of the Gospel: all the hills and
   mountains shall be humbled. [Ps. 148:9; Luke 3:5]

   The valleys are the humility of a contrite heart; in the psalm: and the
   valley abounds in fruit. and in a bad part of the prophet, the valley
   of the sons of Ennos. [Ps. 64(65):14(13); Jeremiah 19:2]

   The rock is Christ in strength; in the apostle, moreover, the rock was
   Christ. [1 Cor. 10:4]

   The stones likewise are Christ and all the saints; in the psalm, the
   stone which the builders rejected. The same in another part: great is
   God who brought forth the sons of Abraham from stones. [Ps.
   117(118):22; Matt. 3:9]

   The field is this world; in the gospel: the field is this world. [Matt.
   13:38]

   The plains are the saints and the divine scriptures, on which they put
   out fodder for the living; in the psalm: the plains are full of riches.
   The same in a bad part: in the plain of Zoan. [Ps. 64(65):12; Ps.
   77(78):43]

   The pastures are a spiritual dining hall; in the psalm: he has called
   me to the place of pasture. [Ps. 22(23):2]

   The cultivated fields are the saints, who have grown in God; in the
   apostle: the growth is of God. [1 Cor. 3:9]

   God is the farmer: in the Gospel the Lord says: I am the true vine, and
   my Father is the farmer. [John 15:1, Vulgate]

   The furrows are the heart of the saints; in the psalm: the furrows are
   drenched. [Ps. 64(65):11(12)]

   The seed is the divine precept; in the Gospel: a sower went out to sow
   his seed. [Luke 8:5]

   The harvest is the fertility and abundance of the faithful; in the
   Gospel, lift your eyes and see the areas that are white and ready for
   harvest. And in another place: the harvest is the closing of the age
   and angels are the harvesters. [John 4:35; Matt. 13:39]

   The bundles of hay are the fruit of righteousness; in the psalm:
   carrying their bundles of hay. [Ps. 125(126):6]

   The stubble is the ones who are dry and empty of faith; in the apostle:
   bind the hay stubble, and in the prophet: today I am made as if I were
   bound together like hay in the harvest, that is, I have not found
   workers of good anywhere. [1 Cor. 3:12; Micah 7:1]

   The threshing floor is the church; in the Gospel: and he will clean
   your threshing floor. [Matt. 3:12]

   The winnowing fork is the testing of the righteous by God; in the
   Gospel: whose winnowing fork is in his hand. [ibid.]

   The wheat is the saints and the chosen of God; in the Gospel: and he
   will gather his wheat in a storehouse. [ibid.]

   Barley is the letter of the law; in the Gospel: there is one boy, who
   has five loaves of barley bread. [John 6:9]

   The chaff is sinners; in the Gospel: moreover, he burns the chaff in
   unextinguishable fire; and in Jerimiah: the Lord says what is the chaff
   to the wheat? [Matt. 3:12; Jeremiah 23:28]

   The tares are the scandalous, who live badly; in the Gospel: an enemy
   came and planted tares in the midst of the wheat. [Matt. 13:25]

   The vineyard is the church, the people of Israel; in the psalm; you
   have transported your vineyard from Egypt. The same in a bad part: you
   will shun the vineyard of the Sodomites. [Ps. 79(80):9(8); Deut. 32:32]

   The vine is Christ; in the gospel: I am the true vine. The same in
   another part as above in the song of Deuteronomy: you will shun the
   vineyard of the Sodomites. [John 15:1, Deut. 32:32]

   The branches are the apostles and the saints; in the gospel: I am the
   vine, you are the branches. In a bad part of the song of Deuteronomy:
   and their branches from Gommorah. [John 15:5, Deut. 32:32]

   The fruit of the grape is righteousness; in the song of Isaiah: I have
   waited for the grape to ripen. The same in a bad part of Deuteronomy:
   their grape is the grape of hatred. [Is. 5:4, Deut. 32:32]

   The bunch of grapes is the church, the body of Christ; in Numbers:
   because the sons of Israel carried a bunch of grapes from there. [Num.
   13:25]

   The grape harvest is the fulfillment of the age, vindication of the
   people; in the psalm: they will then harvest all who went before them
   in the way. And in Joel: send scythes and harvest your vineyard, for
   the grapes are ripe. [Ps. 79(80):13 Vulgate; Joel 3:13]

   The press is his altar, because there the fruit becomes oblation; in
   the canticle of Isaiah: I dug the winepress in it. And the pressure of
   tribulation is another winepress, in which the faithful are proven; in
   the title of a psalm: in the end in place of winepresses. [Is. 5:2, Ps.
   8:1 Vulgate]

   The hay is the flesh, empty glory; in the prophet: all flesh is hay,
   and all its glory is like the flowering of the hay. [Is. 40:6]

   The grass is joy which profits the soul; in Genesis: he brought forth
   green grass on the earth. The same in a bad part: in the morning let
   the grass wither. [Gen. 1:11, Ps. 89(90):6]

   The flowers are Christk the ideal of righteousness; in the psalm: he is
   just that the palm may flourish. [Ps. 91(92):13(12) Vulgate]

   The lily is Christ, or the angels aflame with righteousness; in
   Solomon: I am the blossom of the field and the lily of the valley.
   [Cant. 2:1]

   The roses are martyrs red with blood; in Solomon, as a rose flourishes
   above a wet stream. [Eccl. 39:17]

   The violets are the confessors in bluish likeness of body; in the Song
   of Songs, the flowers are seen on the earth. [Cant. 2:12]

   The trees are the gentiles; in the psalm: we found it in a plain of
   trees. From these trees two Roman emperors went forth as bears,
   according to the teaching in the figure of Elisha and forty-two years
   after his Ascension into the heavens, they ate the Jewish youths. [Ps.
   131(132):6 Vulgate, IV Kings 2:24 Vulgate]

   The dense darkness is the hidden part of Divine Scripture; in the
   psalm: and he has revealed the hidden things. [Ps. 28(29):9 Vulgate]

   The wood is sinners consigned to the fires; in Ecclesiastes: he who
   splits the wood, tests it. The same in a good part: and he will be as
   the wood that is planted. [Eccl. 9:10; Ps. 1:3]

   The root is the beginning; in the Apostle, because if the root is
   blessed, so are the branches. And in a bad part of the Psalms: and
   [tear] your living root from the earth. [Rom. 11:16; Ps. 51(52):7(5)]

   The tree is a man whose work is fruitful; in the gospel: or make a good
   tree and its good fruit. The same in a bad part: or make a bad tree and
   its bad fruit. The same in this parable, the tree is the will of man,
   rather than being what man himself thinks he will receive. [Matt.
   12:33]

   The branch is succession; in the Apostle: because if the root is
   blessed, the branch is blessed. The same in a bad part of Daniel: cut
   off his branches. [Rom. 11:16, Dan. 4:11]

   The leaves are the preaching of doctrine; in the psalm, and its leaves
   will not fall off. And likewise, the leaves are the clothing and beauty
   with the protection of divine grace. [Ps. 1:3]

   The apple is the fruit of the saints in virtue: in the Song of Songs,
   ans he shall eat the fruit of his own apples. [Cant. 5:1]

   The palm is completion, victory; in the psalm, he is just so that the
   palm may flourish. [Ps. 91(92):13(12)]

   The cedars are men of the highest power; in the psalm: that they may
   grow as the cedars of Lebanon. And in a bad part of the psalm: and the
   Lord breaks the cedars of Lebanon. [Ps. 91(92):13(12), Ps. 28(29):5]

   The olive is the saint abounding in the fruit of mercy; in the psalm, I
   am like a flourishing olive. [Ps. 51(52):10(8)]

   The wild olive is a man abounding in the fruit of gentleness; in the
   Apostle, I am like the fruitful olive. [Rom. 11:24]

   The fig is the synagogue of this age; in the gospel, and the fig tree
   was barren from then on, and in Habakkuk: the fig does not bear fruit.
   [Matt. 21:19, Hab. 3:17]

   The pomegranate is the church of many people who give thanks in
   different ways; in the Song of Songs, sending forth your garden of
   pomegranate with the fruit of the apple. [Cant. 4:13]

   The twig is the sinner, the one weak in faith; in the gospel, he will
   not break the shaken twig. Likewise, a twig is a weak help; in the
   prophet, how do you rely on a staff, itself an Egyptian twig? If he
   will lean upon it, he will be severely shaken, and it will pierce his
   hand. [Matt. 12:20, Is. 36:6]

   The bramble bush is, as is sometimes thought, a prefiguration of the
   Blessed Theotokos, because it is as if he sent forth the salvation of
   human flesh like a rose from a bramble bush, or because the strength of
   divine lightning went through it without consuming it; in Exodus, the
   Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from the middle of the bush and
   he saw that the bush burned and was not consumed. [Ex. 3:2]

   The thorns of the bush are harmful things that keep the soul from
   divine healing; in the gospel, another was killed with thorns. [Luke
   8:7]

   The sting of the thistle is wickness or temptation; in Genesis, it will
   grow thorns and thistles for you. [Gen. 3:18]

   The springs are baptism; in the psalm: as the hart longs for the
   springs of water. [Ps. 41(42):2(1)]

   The water is the testing of people; in the psalm, perhaps the water
   would have swallowed us. The same in a good part of Jeremiah: they have
   forsaken me, the font of living water. And in the prophet: let him who
   thirsts, come to the water, that is, to belief. [Ps. 123(124):4; Jer
   2:13; Is 55:1]

   The stream is the course of persecution; in the psalm: he drinks from
   the stream in the way. The same in a good part: you will give them
   drink from the stream of your will. [Ps. 109(110):7; Ps.Ps.
   35(36):9(8)]

   The rivers are the unfaithful people; in the psalm: by the waters of
   Babylon. The same in a good part: the living waters flow from your
   stomach, that is spiritual grace. [Ps. 136(137); 1, John 7:38]

   The lake is the inferno; in the psalm, they put in the lower lake, that
   is, the place of the inferno, in which sinners alone are held in penal
   custody. [Ps. 87(88):7(6)]

   The sea is the people of this age; in the psalm: here is the sea great
   and wide. [Ps. 103(104):25]

   The fish are the saints; in the gospel: and they dragged a multitude of
   great fishes in their net. The same in a bad part: however, the evil
   are sent out of doors. [John 21:11; Matt. 13:48]

   The billows are temptations; in the psalm: all Your waves and billows
   have gone over me. [Ps. 41(42):8(7)]

   The wave is the same as above; in the song [of Moses]: the waves have
   frozen in the middle of the sea. [Ex. 15:8]

   The islands are our souls in the church of God, which are pounded with
   many temptations and floods; in the psalm: let the many islands
   rejoice. [Ps. 96(97):1]

   The shore is the end of the age; in the gospel: and otherwise they
   choose the good ones sitting on the shore. [Matt. 13:48]

   The sands of the sea are the uncountable multitudes of people; in
   Genesis: and I will multiply your seed as the stars in the sky and as
   the sand, which is at the mouth of the sea. [Gen. 22:17]

IV. On the Animals

   The birds are the saints, because they fly to the higher heart; in the
   gospel: and he made great branches that the birds of the air might live
   in their shade. [Mark 4:32]

   Flying is the death of the saints in God or the knowledge of the
   Scriptures; in the psalm: I shall fly and I shall be at rest. [Ps.
   54(55):7 Vulgate]

   The wings are the two testaments; in Ezekiel: your body will fly with
   two wings of its own. [Ez. 1:23]

   The feathers are the Scriptures; in the psalm: the wings of the silver
   dove. [Ps. 67(68):14(13)]

   The nest is the church, the high peace of the blessed; in the psalm:
   and the turtledove is in its nest where it places its chicks. And
   likewise, a good conscience is a nest, in which the the fetus of good
   thoughts is cherished and it is born in good works, that they may be
   called children afterward; in the psalm: your children are like a new
   olive around your table. [Ps. 83(84):4(3) Vulgate; Ps. 127(128):3]

   The chicks are the saints; in the psalm as above, and in a bad part of
   Solomon: and let the fledgelings of eagles devour him. [Prov. 30:17]

   The eagles are the saints; in the gospel: where a body will be, there
   shall the eagles gather. And in a bad part: Let the fledgelings of
   eagles devour him. [Matt. 24:28 and Prov. 30:17]

   The ostrich is a heretic, or a philosopher, because they do not fly
   with the wings of their wisdom; in Isaiah: and he will be a resting
   place for the dragon and a pasture for the ostrich. [Is. 34:13]

   The pelican is the Lord Jesus Christ in his passion or the holy man
   given to solitude; in the psalm: I have become solitary like a pelican.
   [Ps. 101(102):7 Vulgate]

   The crow is the black of the sinner or of the demons; in Solomon: the
   crows tore him from the valleys. The same in a good part of the Song of
   Songs about the spouse: his hair is that is passing away is black like
   the crow. [Cant. 5:11]

   The partridge is the devil; in the prophet: the partridge has cried, it
   has gathered that which it has not sown. [Jer. 17:11]

   The dove is the Holy Spirit; in the gospel: and I saw the spirit of God
   descending like a dove. The same in another part: in Ephraim, a dove
   without feeling, without a heart. [John 1:32; Hosea 7:11]

   The turtledove is the Holy Spirit or the blessed man or spiritual
   intelligence; in the Song of Songs: the voice of the turtle was heard
   in our land. But then the dove is said to be the Holy Spirit; the
   context of many holy scriptures asserts it: then turtledove is
   understood to be the Holy Spirit in truth, when high scriptures or
   hidden mysteries are brought up. [Cant. 2:12]

   The kite signifies, so I think, rapacity or pride; in the psalm,
   according to the Hebrew: the kite, once away, is at home. [Ps.
   103(104):17 (unknown variant)]

   The hawk, however, is a saint, so I think, seizing the Kingdom of God;
   in Job: is not the hawk plumed in Your wisdom? [Job 39:26]

   The owl is Christ, or the saint who despices infidels; in the psalm: I
   am made like an owl in its dwelling. [Ps. 101(102):7 Vulgate]

   The sparrow sometimes is the Lord or a holy man; in the psalm: indeed
   the sparrow has found itself a home. And it is another sparrow that is
   like a holy man: flying across the mountain like a sparrow. [Ps.
   83(84):4(3); Ps. 10(11):2(1) Vulgate]

   The cock is the Lord, so I think, or a saint: in Solomon: and the cock
   is glad as it walks among the hens. And in Job: who gave the cock
   knowledge? And in another part: and I shall cause you to be carried off
   as domestic poultry is carried away. [Prov. 30:31; Job 38:36; Is. 22:17
   Vulgate]

   The hen is wisdom or the church or the soul; in the gospel: as a hen
   gathers her chicks beneath her wings. [Matt. 23:37]

   Bats are considered portents of the idols of darkness; in the prophet:
   that you may love moles and bats. [Is. 2:20]

   The beetle in the prophet: and the beetle will cry from the wood, so I
   think, this means from the wood of the Lord {the cross}. [Hab. 2:11]

   The locusts are the people; in the gospel: his food, moreover, was
   locusts. [Matt. 3:4]

   The bees are the stamp of virginity or of wisdom; in Solomon: go to the
   bee and learn how to be a worker; and in a bad part of the prophet: and
   the bee which is in Assyria. [Prov. 6:6; Is. 7:18]

   The fly is the devil; in Solomon: the flies of death have exterminated
   the oil of sweetness. [Eccles. 10:1]

   The wild animals are the devil or wild men; in the psalm: You do not
   take the wild beasts into your trust. [Ps. 73(74):19 Vulgate]

   The lion is the Lord: the lion from the tribe of Judah conquers; again
   in another part: let the lion seize my soul at any time. [Apoc. 5:5;
   Ps. 7:3(2)]

   The leopard is the devil, or the untrustworthy sinner in death; in the
   prophet: as an Ethiopian cannot change his skin nor a leopard his
   spots. [Jeremiah 13:23]

   The elephant is a great sinner; in Kings: and they led apes and
   elephants to Solomon. [III(I) Kings 10:22]

   The bear is the devil, or the barbarian leaders; in Kings: two bears
   were brought forth and they ate them. [IV(II)Kings 2:24]

   The stag is Christ, or the saints; as a deer longs for the streams of
   water. [Ps. 41(42):2(1)]

   The wolf is the devil or heretics; in the gospel: the wolves are
   inherently rapacious. The same in a good part: Benjamin, meaning the
   Apostle Paul, is a ravening wolf. [Matt. 7:15; Gen. 49:27]

   The boar is the devil; in the psalm: the boar has driven him from the
   forest. [Ps. 79(80):14(13)]

   The tiger is effeminate arrogance; in the book of Job, according to the
   Hebrews: the tiger dies because it has no prey. [Job 4:11]

   The rhinoceros is strength, either in a good or bad part; in the book
   of Job, according to the Hebrews: whether the rhinoceros wishes to
   serve you. [Job 39:9]

   The one-horned is the unicorn; in the psalm: and my beloved son is like
   a unicorn, that is, of unique power, or unique among the saints, who
   wholly keep the word of God. And in another part: and my humility is
   like the horn of a unicorn. The unicorns having this magnificence or
   one testimony. [Ps. 28(29):6 Vulgate; Ps. 21(22):22 Vulgate]

   The wild ass is a hermit; in Job: who sets the wild ass free? He can,
   and I have said that the tribe of Judah is that wild ass, and as
   follows in the same book: and who has loosed his bonds? The bonds
   likewise are the law. [Job 39:5]

   The fawn is Christ, or the saint because of the multiplicity of his
   graces; in Solomon: my little brother, you are like a little antelope
   or like the fawn of a deer. [Cant. 2:9]

   The antelope is the same as above.

   The rabbit is one who fears God; in the psalm: the rocks are a refuges
   for the hares and the hedgehogs. [Ps. 103(104):18 Vulgate]

   The hedgehog is as above; and the hedgehogs are a weak nation, who make
   their homes among the rocks.

   The fox is a heretic or the devil or a shrewd sinner; in the gospel:
   go, tell that fox. [Luke 13:32]

   The beast is the man of flesh; in the apostle: the man of flesh does
   not see those who are in the spirit of God. [I Cor. 2:14]

   The beasts of burden lack understanding and intelligence; in the psalm:
   and I have become the beasts of burden before you. [Ps. 72(73):23(22)]

   The horse is a holy man; in Habakkuk: he who has risen above your
   horses; and in a bad part: a deceitful horse into safety. [Hab. 3:8;
   Ps. 32(33):17 Vulgate]

   The mule is an irrational man; in the psalm: do not wish to become like
   the horse and the mule who do not understand. [Ps. 31(32):9]

   The ass is the human body or the people of the gentiles; in the gospel:
   and they led an ass and its colt to Jesus and they made him sit on the
   colt. [Matt. 21:7]

   The female ass is a circle of bystanders, or a people who lack
   acquaintance with God; in the gospel: the same as above.

   The camel is the wealth of a burdened age or the deformation of the
   dead; in the gospel: it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye
   of a needle than for the wealthy to enter into the kingdom of the
   heavens. [Matt. 19:24]

   The bulls are the leaders of the people; in the psalm: the fat bulls
   surrounded me. [Ps. 21(22):13(12)]

   The oxen are the apostles, who take on the yoke of Christ, the gospel,
   the ploughshare with which they plow the world; in the psalm: I offer
   to you my oxen with my goats. [Ps. 65(66):15]

   The cows are those full of fleshly faults; in the psalm: among the cows
   of the people. [Ps. 67(68):31(30)]

   The calf is Christ, or the saints; in the psalm: there they shall place
   calves upon Your altar. And in another part: many calves surrounded me,
   here it is poetic license. [Ps. 50(51):21(19); Ps. 21(22):13(12)]

   The pigs are unclean sinners; in the epistle of Peter: the pig is
   washed by rolling in the mud. [II Peter 2:22]

   The rams are the apostles or the leaders of the church; in the psalm:

   rationality than of keenness; in Solomon: feed the animals of your
   flock. [Prov. 27:23]

   The goats are the sinners or the gentiles; in Daniel: behold, a male
   goat among the she-goats came from the west over the face of the whole
   land. The same in a good part: I offer you cows with goats. [Dan. 8:5;
   Ps. 65(66):15]

   The nanny-goats are the just who come from the gentiles; in Solomon:
   your long hair is like a herd of she-goats, which have appeared in
   Gilead. [Cant. 6:4]

   The lambs are Christ, or the apostles, or the saints; in the gospel:
   feed my lambs. [John 21:15]

   The kids are sinners; in the gospel: the kids, however, are on the
   left. [Matt. 25:33]

   The moles are idols, or heretics, who do not see the truth; in Isaiah:
   that you may worship moles and bats. [Is. 2:20]

   The dog is the devil or Judas or a gentile; in the psalm: and my only
   life from the hand of the dog. And in another part in Ecclesiastes: a
   living dog is better than a dead lion. Here they think that the lion is
   the devil, the dog is a true gentile or a man accepting a sinner
   because one can come to faith or repentance, while the other cannot.
   [Ps. 21(22):21 Vulgate; Eccl. 9:4]

   The frogs are demons; in the Apocalypse: and I saw three unclean
   spirits in the form of frogs come from the mouth of a dragon; they were
   the spirits of demons. Frogs are also heretics, who do not cease to
   babble at a meal with vain talkativeness as they dwell in the most vile
   bodily feelings. [Apoc. 16:13-14]

   The ant is prudent and hard-working; in Solomon: go to the ant, o
   sluggard. [Prov. 6:6]

   not kill them, that is either the worm itself or the knowledge of sin.
   [Ps. 21(22):7(6); Is. 66:24]

   The spider is human frailty; in the psalm: you have made his soul to
   wither like a spider. [Ps. 38(39):12 Vulgate]

   The snake is the devil or bad men; in the gospel: snakes are the equals
   of vipers. The same in another part of the gospel: as Moses raised the
   snake in the wilderness. [Matt. 23:33; John 3:14]

   The dragon is the devil, or the overt tormenter; in the psalm: You have
   broken the head of the dragons, You have given him to the people of

V. On the Various Names and Titles

   let not man prevail, here is flesh or the devil. [Gen. 1:27; Ps.
   9:20(19)]

   The man is the spirit, that is, the mind; in the apostle: man is the

   the mind greatly with imagining. [I Cor. 11:3; Gen. 24:16-18]

   The woman is the heart, or the human flesh; in the apostle: the man is

   The bride is the church, which is promised to the divine bridegroom; in
   the song of songs: I came from Lebanon, my bride, I came from Lebanon.

   drink, and be merry, neighbors. [Cant. 5:1]

   Friends are harmony in God; in the gospel: you are my friends. [John
   15:14]

   The old man is the fullfillment of righteousness; in Genesis: and
   Abraham, an old man of many days, died. And in Solomon: I sing that the
   sense of man and the time of old age are a clean life. And in another
   part about Solomon: when he was yet an old man, his heart was
   perverted. [Gen. 25:8; Wisdom 4:8-9; III(I) Kings 11:4]

   Youths are cheerful before God; in the letter of John: I write to you,
   young man, because you are strong and you remain in the word of God and
   you have conquered evil. And in a bad part of the book of Kings about
   Raboham: the council place of the elders is abandoned according to the
   plan of young men. [I John 2:14; III(I) Kings 12-13]

   The child is humble and simple of mind; in the gospel: You have hidden
   this from the wise and prudent and have revealed it to the children.

   The harlot is the heart of a sinner, who has left her heavenly husband,
   that is, Christ, and brings forth adulterous fruit of iniquity from the
   devil; in Jeremiah: you have the face of an adulterous woman. [Jer.
   3:3]

   Workmen are the apostles, or those who proclaim the gospel; in the
   gospel: the harvest is great, but the workers are few. [Matt. 9:37]

   The shepherd is the Lord; in the gospel: I am the good shepherd. The
   same shepherd is the apostle; in the gospel, feed my sheep. [John
   10:11; John 21:17]

   The hired servants are those who serve the Lord not so much from divine
   love as for temporal rewards; in the gospel: how many hired servants at
   my father's have abundant bread! [Luke 15:17]

   The fishermen are the apostles or the doctors; in the gospel: and I
   will make you fishers of men. [Matt. 4:19]

   The doctor is Christ or a teacher; in Solomon: the doctor is a gentle
   man with a heart. And again: the healthy do not need a physician, but
   the unhealthy do. [unknown; Luke 5:31]

   The rich man is faithful, abounding in spiritual good; in the apostle:
   because you have been made rich in all knowledge and in all words. And
   in a bad part of the gospel: woe to you who are rich! [I Cor. 1:5; Luke
   6:24]

   The poor man is humble; in the gospel: and Lazarus was a beggar. The
   same: blessed are the poor in spirit. And in a bad part of the psalm:
   because we have become very much like beggars. [Luke 16:20; Matt. 5:3;
   Ps. 78(79):8]

   The clothed have baptism or integrity of faith; in the gospel: and he
   saw there was a man who was not wearing a wedding garment. [Matt.
   22:11]

   The naked lack a baptismal garment or divine aid; in the apocalypse:
   you, however, are naked and poor. And in a good part of the gospel: and
   having tossed aside his garment, he said, the naked man fled from him,
   that is, naked by an earthly means. [Apoc. 3:17; Mark 14:52]

   The living are upright: in the psalm: I will please the Lord in the
   land of the living. And in another part in Ecclesiastes: and I have
   praised the dead more than the living. [Ps. 114(116):9 Vulgate; Eccl.
   4:2]

   The dead are sinners or infidels; in the gospel: let the dead bury
   their dead. And in a good part: blessed are those who have died in the
   Lord. And the same: you are dead and your life is hidden with Christ in
   God. [Mat. 8:22; Apoc. 14:13; Col. 3:3]

   Corpses are the bodies of the unfaithful; in the prophet: and let me
   fill the valley of Josaphat with the corpses of the dead. The same in
   another part: they have put the corpses of your servants {out for
   food}. [Joel 3:3; Ps. 78(79):2]

   The tomb is the body of a sinner who has a dead soul within while
   alive; in the gospel; because you are like a whitened selpulchre, which
   on the outside they make pleasing to men, but inside it is full of the
   bones of many dead. [Matt. 23:27]
     __________________________________________________________________

VI. On the Interior Man

   The interior man is the rational soul; in the apostle: have in your
   hearts, in the interior man, Christ through faith. [Eph. 3:16]

   His head is Christ; in the apostle: the head of the man is Christ. [I
   Cor. 11:3]

   The crown of the head is the height of righteousness; in Solomon: for
   the crown of your head has received the crown of grace. The same in a
   bad part: the crown of hairs having walked about in their own delights,
   that is, in the height of iniquity. [Prov. 4:9; Ps. 67(68):22(21)]

   The hair is the ornament of righteousness or sense; in the gospel:
   moreover, the hairs of your head are counted. [Matt. 10:30]

   The eyes are the understanding of faith and are simple; in the gospel:
   blessed are your eyes because they have seen. And in a bad part of the
   gospel: if your eye were worthless. [Matt. 13:16; Matt. 6:23]

   The ears are obedience to the faith; in the gospel: and your ears
   because they have heard. [Matt. 13:16]

   The nostrils are the breath of faith and of the strength of the good;
   in Job: and the Holy Spirit is in my nostrils. And in a bad part of
   Job: smoke, that is, the devil, came from his nostrils. [Job 27:3; Job
   41:11]

   The throat is discernment of understanding; in the book of Job: does
   not my throat meditate on wisdom? And in a bad part: my throat has been
   made hoarse. [Job 12:11; Ps. 68(69):4(3)]

   The mouth is conversation itself; in the psalm: the mouth of the
   righteous meditates on wisdom. [Ps. 36(37):30 Vulgate]

   The tongue is the same as above; in the psalm: and his tongue speaks
   righteousness. [Ps. 36(37):30]

   The hand is work; in the psalm: and I have washed my hands among
   innocents. [Ps. 25(26):6]

   The right hand is good works; in the gospel: let your left hand not
   know what your right has done. [Matt. 6:3]

   The left hand is works that are not good; in the gospel: the same as
   above.

   The breast is the mystery of understanding; in the gospel: the disciple
   whom Jesus loved the most reclined on the breast of the Lord. [John
   21:20]

   The stomach is the rational capacity; in Habakkuk: my stomach is
   disturbed within me. [Hab. 3:16]

   The kidneys are the interior sense; in the psalm: my reins teach me at
   night, at all times, and from above. [Ps. 15(16):7 Vulgate]

   The loins are strength of soul; in the apostle: gird the loins of your
   mind. [Eph. 6:14]

   The navel is the center of desire; in Job: and his strength is above
   the navel of the stomach, that is, because the female genitals here
   mean the same as the loins of men. [Job 40:11]

   The fat marrow is divine grace; in the psalm: my soul is filled with
   marrow and fat. The same in a bad part: the marrow is the thickness of
   evil; in the psalm: they have enclosed their marrow. [Ps. 16(17):10
   Vulgate]

   The bones are the firmness of the soul; in the psalm: my bones say,
   Lord, who is like You? And in a bad part of the book of Job: my bones
   are like a tube in the air. [Ps. 34(35):10; Job 40:13]

   The innards are the effect of piety and mercy; in the apostle: anything
   in your innards and compassion. And in another part in the acts of the
   apostles of Judea: his innards were poured out. [Phil. 2:1; Acts 1:18]

   The skin is a sign of mortality; in Genesis: and He made them garments
   of skin. [Gen. 3:21]

   The blood is the work of the flesh; in the psalm: free me from blood, O
   Lord, Lord of my salvation. And in the same: Flesh and blood cannot
   possess the kingdom of God. [Ps. 50(51):16(14); I Cor. 15:50]

   The flesh is the exterior man; in the apostle: my flesh desires against
   my spirit, and my spirit also against my flesh. [Gal. 5:17]

   The knees are a confession of humility; in the song: and now the knees
   of my heart are bent. The knees are also the strength of faith; in the
   prophet: leave me seven thousand men, who not bend their knees to Baal.
   [Eph. 3:14; III(I) Kings 19:18]

   The feet are the course of life and stability of mind, or of faith; in
   the psalm: our feet were standing. And in a bad part in the prophet:
   why do you maim our feet and our necks? and: their swift feet to the
   letting of blood. [Ps. 121(122):2; III(I) Kings 18:21]

   The heel is the deceit of the shrewd; in Genesis: she will herself
   watch out for your head, and you for his heel. And in a bad part: he
   has lifted his heel against me. [Gen. 3:15; John 13:18]

   The footstep is the completion of work; in the psalm: direct my
   footsteps on Your path. [Ps. 16(17):5 Vulgate]

   Footprints are signs of virtues; in the psalm: let my footprints not be
   moved. And in another part of Solomon: and our life, that is, of
   impieties, has passed like the footprint of a ship. [Ps. 16(17):5
   Vulgate; Wisdom 2:3]

   The robe is the clothing of baptism or of faith; in the gospel: quickly
   bring out the first robe. [Luke 15:22]

   A garment of goat hair is a sign of repentance; in the gospel: at times
   they repented in sackcloth and ashes. [Matt. 11:21]

   girded me with joy. [Ps. 29(30):12(11)]

   in preparation for the gospel of peace. [Eph. 6:15]

   of righteousness and the shield of faith and the helmet of salvation
   and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. [Eph. 6:16-17]

VII. On the Useful or the Ordinary

   The bread is Christ or conversation of the Lord; in the gospel: I am
   the living bread. [John 6:41]

   The wine is the same as above; in Solomon: and drink this wine, which I
   have blended for you. [Prov. 9:5]

   Olive oil is mercy or the Holy Spirit; in the psalm: I have anointed
   him with my holy oil. The same in another part: Let not the oil of the
   sinner, that is, admiration, touch my head. [Ps. 88(89):21(20); Ps.
   140(141):5]

   Pork is sin; in the psalm: they are sated with pork. [Ps. 16(17):14
   (unknown variant)]

   Yeast that does not ferment is inquity; in the apostle: in the yeast of
   sincerity and truth. [I Cor. 5:8]

   The best flour is purity of mind and strength of love; in Leviticus: if
   the soul offers a gift of sacrifice to God, let its gift be the finest
   flour. [Lev. 2:1]

   A small baked cake is an oblation of humility; in Genesis: make haste,
   sprinkle three measures of the best flour, and make little cakes. [Gen.
   18:6]

   Milk is sincerity of mind; in the letter of Peter: reasonably long for
   milk, without pain. The same in another part: I gave you milk to drink,
   not food; yet you will not drink it. Here milk is a small amount of
   understanding. [I Peter 2:2; I Cor. 3:2]

   Rennet is insensitivity to life; in the psalm: their heart is like milk
   gone sour. [Ps. 118(119):70 Vulgate]

   Salt is the seasoning of wisdom; in the gospel: you are the salt of the
   earth. [Matt. 5:13]

   Honey is the sweet teaching of God; in the psalm: how much sweeter your
   eloquence is to my throat, O Lord, than honey is in my mouth. The same
   in Solomon: finding honey, eat as much as is enough, lest you vomit in
   overabundance, that is, lest you seek what is too great for you. [Ps.
   118(119):103; Prov. 25:16; Eccl. 3:22]

   Bile is the love of injustice; in the psalm: they gave me bile for
   food. [Ps. 68(69):22(21) Vulgate]

   Vinegar is the roughness of a corrupt mind; in the psalm: and in my
   thrist, they gave me vinegar to drink. [Ps. 68(69):22(21)]

   Pitch is inequity and blackness of offenses: in Solomon: he who touches
   pitch is defiled from it. [Eccl. 13:1]

   Strong drink is the completion of a specific inquity; in the gospel: he
   will not drink wine or strong drink. [Luke 1:15]

   The wine cup is the passion of the Lord; in the psalm: I will take up
   the cup of salvation. [Ps. 115(116):13]

   New wine is the sincerity of the just or the truth or the fire of
   faith; in the psalm: it is mixed fully with wine and new wine. [Ps.
   74(75):9(8) Vulgate]

   The dregs are the last of the righteous; in the psalm: truly his dregs
   are not emptied. [Ps. 74(75):9(8) Vulgate]

   Food is discourse or the will of God; in the gospel: my food is doing
   the will of my Father who sent me. [John 4:34]

   Drink is the same as above; in the psalm: You give them drink of the
   fountain of Your will, that is, of the Holy Spirit. The same in another
   part: the kingdom of God is not food and drink. [Ps. 35(36):9(8)
   Vulgate; Rom. 14:17]

   The granary is the reservoir of the heart; in the canticle of
   Deuteronomy: in fear in the granary. [Deut. 33:16]

   The knapsack is anxiety about the means of living; in the gospel: I
   will not perish in the way. [Matt. 10:10]

   The purse is stored up treasure in God; in the gospel: make your purses
   which shall not grow old. And in another part: let us have a common
   purse, that is, desire {for the Lord}. [Luke 12:33; Prov. 1:14]

   Money is the divine word; in the gospel: therefore, you ought to have
   sent my money out to the exchangers. [Matt. 25:27]

   A pelt of sheepskin is the people; in the psalm: and let him descend as
   rain upon a pelt of sheepskin. [Ps. 71(72):6 Vulgate]

   Linen is spiritual strength or candor; in Exodus: next you will prepare
   tunics of linen for the sons of Aaron. [Ex. 28:40]

   The bottle is the form of the human body; in the gospel: one ought to
   put new wine in new bottles. [Luke 5:38]

   Flour is good work or knowledge; in the gospel: the wife hid it in
   three measures of flour. [Luke 13:21]

   The millstone is conversion of life; in the gospel: two are milling in
   a millstone. The stones of the millstone can mean the two testaments,
   through which with labor the wheat sown with the old instrument is made
   into the flour of the gospel. [Matt. 24:41]

   Here, therefore, the names which occur in the text of the holy readings
   are translated, literally or broadly, with accepted keys, that we may
   articulate them; I allow that many meanings may come out in diversity
   of person, time, and place. Let them be brought out in metaphors
   congruent with places, in accordance with the rules of allegorical
   interpretation. Now then. . . .

   The abyss is to be understood, as we have said above, as the profound
   depth of the scriptures or an infinity of deep water; many springs
   burst forth from the abyss. The righteousness of God is such an
   ineffable abyss: Your righteousness is a great abyss. Hades is also an
   abyss: who, then, has descended into the abyss? That is Christ who
   called forth the dead. The abyss is also the human heart in the
   darkness of sins: the abyss has said: it, that is, wisdom, is not with
   me. [Gen. 7:11; Ps. 35(36):7(5) Vulgate; Rom. 10:7; Job 28:14]

   Fire, as we have mentioned above, is taken as the Holy Spirit. And fire
   as His all-encompassing love, the fire of His flames. Fire is
   tribulation: we have been tried by fire as silver is tried by fire.
   Fire is anger: and I will consume them in the fire of my anger, says
   the Lord. Fire is desire: all are adulterers, their hearts are like an
   oven for baking bread. [Ps. 65(66):10; Ezek. 22:31; Hosea 7:4]

   The shade, as we have indicated, means divine protection; the shade, in
   other cases, means sins: sitting in darkness and shade like the dead.
   Shade, in yet another case, means punishments; in Job: where the shadow
   of death is and no order exists. And such shade is not far from its
   business, which is the shade, thus, death is not far from punishment,
   which brings death. In another case, shade is the enjoyment of sins; in
   Job about the devil: under the shade he sleeps in the secrecy of reeds
   and in wet places and, once more, the outward appearance is a different
   matter, where many in that form mean one thing. [Job 40:16]

   The two testaments, as we have mentioned, may signify two millstones
   because two stones are in a mill. Likewise, the two testaments may
   signify the two Cherubim in Exodus; two animals in Habakkuk; two rocks,
   in Exodus and in the Song of Songs, which Moses and the bride cover
   with a veil; two bronze mountains in Zachariah, from which came teams
   of four, with horses of red, black, white, and other colors, out of the
   hidden shade of the myrtle thicket. [Ex. 25:18; Hab. 3:8; Ex. 17:6;
   Cant. 2:14; Zech. 6:1-4]

   But these, we think, have so many multiple meanings for each name that
   following them is not only a task of great difficulty but even an
   impossibility. Now, therefore, we return to the order and mode of
   interpretation we had interrupted necessarily for a short while.

   Baskets are the apostles; in the gospel: and they put the plentiful
   leftovers in twelve baskets. The same in another part: their hands were
   enslaved in a basket, that is, in servitude and tribulation, which the
   Egyptians had wrought. [Matt. 14:20; Ps. 80(81):7(6) Vulgate]

   The bishop's seat is instruction; in the psalm: let them in the
   bishop's seat of the elders praise him. The same in a bad part: he
   shall not sit in the bishop's seat of plague, that is, in the
   instruction of heretics. [Ps. 106(107):32 Vulgate; Ps. 1:1 Vulgate]

   The stool is the subjection of the humiliated; in the psalm: until I
   place your enemies beneath your feet as a stool. [Ps. 109(110):1]

   The scales are equity, or the power of divine government; in Isaiah:
   and he weighed the mountains and the hills in his scales. [Is. 40:12]

   Ashes are the emptiness of human frailty; in Solomon: what remains but
   earth and ashes? [Eccl. 10:9]

   The jar is lineage; in the psalm: Moab is the jar of my hope, that is,
   Christ according to the flesh was descended from the lineage of Ruth, a
   Moabite. The same in another part: the jar of tribulation has dried up;
   in the prophet: And I have seen an inflamed jar with its face from the
   face of the north wind. [Ps. 59(60):10(8) Vulgate; Matt. 25:7; Jer.
   1:13]

   Lamps are souls aflame with righteousness; in the gospel: and they
   prepared their lamps. [Matt. 25:7]

   Light is the church or the soul; in the gospel: let your loins be
   girded and your light bright. Several times lights are good works;
   therefore, let your light shine, that they might see your good works.
   [Luke 12:35; Matt. 5:16]

   A bushel basket is the human body, or the letter of the law, or the
   people of Judah; in the gospel; no man light a light and puts it under
   a bushel. [Matt. 5:15]

   The candlestick is the church, or the body of the Lord, or the sacred
   scripture; in the prophet: and I saw on the right of the altar two
   burning candlesticks. [Zech. 4:2]

   The table is the altar or the refreshment of the spirit; in the psalm:
   You prepare a table in my sight. [Ps. 22(23):5]

   The keys are the opening of scriptural knowledge; in Luke: woe to you,
   dying in the law, which you take to be the key of knowledge; you will
   not enter by it, and you will be kept from those who do enter. The same
   keys are the virtues of righteousness, mercy, and piety; in the gospel:
   I give you the keys of the heavenly kingdom. [Luke 11:52; Matt. 16:19]

   The bolt is the bar of divine teaching against the impious; in the
   psalm: since he has made the bolts of your door sound. [Ps.
   146(147):13]

   The axe is the prosecution of the perverse; in the psalm: and with a
   two-edged axe, they felled it. [Ps. 73(74):6(5)]

   The two-edged sword is double affliction; in the psalm, the same as
   above.

   The ship is the church; in the gospel: the small ship was tossed by
   waves in the middle of the sea. As is the custom, I have said that man
   is a small ship, that the thoughts which rule men may be termed
   sailors. [Matt. 14:24]

   Nets are public preaching; in the gospel: and send out your nets for a
   catch. [Luke 5:4]

   Beams are grave sins; in the gospel: first pull the beam from your own
   eye. [Matt. 7:5]

   the rod from your brother's eye. [Matt. 7:5]

   The noose is sorrow; in the psalm: they have prepared a noose for my
   feet. [Ps. 56(57):7(6)]

   The ropes are fortune or heredity; in the psalm: they have beaten me
   with splendid ropes. ropes are also sins; woe to you who bear sins or
   long ropes. Also, the ropes of sinners have bound me. [Ps. 15(16):6
   Vulgate; Is. 5:18; Ps. 118(119):61]

   The {potter's} wheel is an orbit or human life; in the psalm: the voice
   of the thunder in the wheel. And in the same: my God, place them on a
   wheel, that is, make them unstable or fickle in their malice. [Ps.
   76(77):19(18) Vulgate; Ps. 82(83):14(13) Vulgate]

   The sponge is the den of inquity of the Jews; in the gospel: they put a
   sponge filled with vinegar and surrounded by hyssop to his mouth. [John
   19:29]

   The ladder is the perfection of the saints; in Genesis: and he saw in
   his sleep a ldder standing above the earth, and the top of the ladder
   touched heaven. The angels of God ascended and descended on the ladder.
   [Gen. 28:12]

   The broom is the cure of superstition through one glory; in the gospel:
   and he, entering, found it unoccupied, since it had been cleaned with a
   broom and made orderly. [Luke 11:25 (Vulgate)]

   The pearl is the gospel teaching or the hope of the kingdom of heaven;
   in the gospel: having found the precious pearl, he went away and sold
   everything which he had and bought the pearl. [Matt. 13:46]

   The ring is a sign of faith; in the gospel: and put a ring on his hand.
   The same about this in the psalm: O Lord, the light of Your face is a
   sign above us. [Luke 15:22, Ps. 4:7 (Vulgate)]

   The cloak is the apparel of praise; in Solomon: she made cloaks for her
   man, that is, vestments, because he would be clothed in the two
   testaments. [Prov. 31:22]

   Gold is the interior knowledge of the scriptures; in the psalm: and his
   {the dove's} back side has an outline of gold. [Ps. 67(68):14(13)]

   Silver is the divine declaration or knowledge of letters and history;
   in the psalm: the declarations of the Lord, pure declarations, are
   silver tried by the fire. [Ps. 11(12):7(6)]

   Precious stones are the apostles, or the saints, or their works of
   virtue themselves; in the Apocalypse: all the foundational walls of the
   city are decorated with precious stones. [Apoc. 21:19]

   Copper is vanity or empty faith; in the apostle: I am made as a gong.
   The same in another part: you have placed my arms that I may bend
   copper. Here, copper is firm and strong. [1 Cor. 13:1; Ps.
   17(18):35(34)]

     __________________________________________________________________

   (unknown variant)]

   my ways known, and You have heard me. [John14:6; Ps. 118(119):26
   Vulgate]

   Broad places are an expanse of seductive vices; in the gospel: the way
   that leads to destruction has a wide, roomy door. [Matt. 7:13]

     __________________________________________________________________

IX. On Jerusalem and her Enemies

   Jerusalem is the church or the soul; in the psalm: praise the Lord,
   Jerusalem. And to be noted: because everyone generally comes together
   in the church, this can also refer to the soul. [Ps. 147:12]

   Zion is the same as above; in the psalm: praise your God, Zion.
   [Ps.147:12]

   The sons of Zion are the sons of the church; in the psalm: let the sons
   of Zion rejoice in the king. [Ps. 149:2]

   The sons of Jerusalem are the same as above.

   The tabernacle is the body of the Lord or the church; in the psalm: his
   tent {tabernacle} is pitched in the sun. [Ps. 18(19):6(4) Vulgate]

   The ark is the flesh of the Lord or the hearts of the saints; in the
   psalm: you are the ark of my sanctification. The same is the church in
   which those who will be saved are hidden; in Genesis: only Noah and
   those with him in the ark remained. [Ps. 131(132):8 Vulgate; Gen. 7:23]

   The stone tablets are two, I think, because of the two testaments or
   because of the two teachings about loving God and neighbor; in Exodus:
   and the Lord said to Moses, "Carve two stone tablets." [Ex. 34:1]

   The law is divine teaching; in the psalm: the law of the Lord is pure.
   [Ps. 18(19):8 Vulgate]

   Handwriting is the record of a sinful man and the devil by the hand of
   inquity; in the apostle: the handwriting of a sinner which was against
   us. [Col. 2:14]

   The agreement is a compact of divine grace with man; in the psalm: I
   did not see them obeying the pact. [Ps. 77(78):57(56) (unknown
   variant)]

   The testament is a confirmation of divine will; in the prophet: and I
   will confirm the testament with the house of Judah. [Jer. 31:31 and
   Heb. 8:8]

   The foreskin is the life of the gentile; in the apostle: another in the
   foreskin was calledd, not to be circumcised, that is, even one from the
   gentiles who came to faith in Christ will not be circumcised in the
   body. [I Cor. 7:18]

   Circumcision is the finishing off of vices; in the apostle: you were
   circumcised with a circumcision not done by hands in the finishing off
   of the flesh of the body. [Col. 2:11]

   The horn is strength or the kingdom; in Kings: and he raised high the
   horm of His Christ. [I Samuel (I Kings) 2:10]

   Purple is the type of those martyred through bloodshed; in Exodus: all,
   who saw with the heart, in the beginning brought to God gold, silver,
   copper, hyacinth, purple, scarlet, goats' hair, and linen. [Ex. 35:5-6]

   Scarlet is the same as above or the ardor of charity or the remembrance
   of the cross; in Exodus: the same as above.

   Linen is the radiance of chastity or continence; in Exodus: the same as
   above.

   Hyacinth is the blue color of the confessors; in Exodus: the same as
   above.

   The ephod is a sign, on the shoulders, of miracles; in Exodus: and they
   made an ephod of gold and hyacinth and purple and scarlet goats' hair
   and complicated linen. [Ex. 39:2]

   The breastplate is a sinner's avowal of reason or is instruction; in

   and they made a long priestly garment; under the buckle the work was
   made entirely of hyacinth. [Ex. 39:20]

   they made a golden girdle and above it wrote, as he had said, in
   letters forming the sacred sign of the Lord, that is, the
   tetragrammaton name of the Lord. [Ex. 39:29]

   The temple is the body of Christ or the saints; in the apostle: for you
   are the temple of the living God. [II Cor. 6:16]

   The altar is the height of faith; in the psalm: then they will place
   calves upon the altar. [Ps. 50(51):21(19) Vulgate]

   Sacrifice is an offering of righteousness; in the psalm: make a
   sacrifice of righteousness. [Ps. 4:6(5)]

   The burnt offering is a complete kindling of faith; in the psalm: I
   will offer to you a fatty burnt offering. [Ps. 65(66):15]

   The sacrificed is Christ or the soul blessed by God; in the apostle: an
   offering and sacrifice to God in the aroma of sweetness. [Ephes. 5:2]

   Myrhh is the sign of mortality; in the psalm: myrhh and aloe and cassia
   from Your vestments. [Ps. 44(45):9(8) Vulgate]

   Salve is the spreading mercy of the name of Christ; in Solomon: your
   name is like salve spread out. [Cant. 1:2]

   The holy of holies is the interior where abide the mysteries of God or
   the kingdom of heaven; in the epistle to the Hebrews: for Jesus came,
   not as a copy of the truth made by a holy hand, but from the heavens
   themselves that the face of God might appear now for us. [Heb. 9:24]

   The sabbath is spiritual rest; in Genesis: and the Lord rested from his
   labors. [Gen. 2:2]

   Lent is the form of this life and its labor; in the gospel: and when he
   had fasted forty days and forty nights. [Matt. 4:2]

   Pascha is the announcement of the Lord's passover; in the gospel:
   before the day of the feast of Passover Jesus, knowing that his hour
   had come and that he would pass from this world to his Father. [John
   13:1]

   The fifty days {between Pascha and Pentecost} are signs of future
   blessedness or release; in Leviticus: therefore, you will count seven
   full weeks from the time of the day at the altar and after that is
   fifty days. [Lev. 23:15-16]

   The jubilee is a the sign of the peace to come; in Leviticus: it is the
   year of release; it will be a sacred sign to us. [Lev. 25:10]

   The city is the church of God or the soul; in the psalm: in the city of
   our God. [Ps. 47(48):2 Vulgate]

   The citizens are the faithful; in the apostle: but you are citizens of
   saints and of the household of God. [Eph. 2:19]

   The walls are the protection of the divine scriptures or of the
   prophets or of the saints; in the psalm: the walls of Jerusalem will be
   built. The same in another part: in my God I shall step across the
   wall. [Ps. 50(51):20(18); Ps. 17(18):30 Vulgate]

   The towers are the apostles or every perfect one; in the psalm: and
   fulness is in Your towers. [Ps. 121(122):7 Vulgate]

   The gates are the sacred scriptures or righteousness or the apostles or
   the angels; in the psalm: and be raised up, ancient gates. The same in
   another part: how wide the gate and spacious the way that leads to
   night. [Ps. 23(24):7; Matt. 7:13]

   The streets are the broad holiness of the saints; in the apocalypse:
   and the streets of the city were gold so pure that they shone like
   glass. [Apoc. 21:21]

   The foundation is Christ or faith; in the apostle: for no one can put
   another foundation besides the one that Christ Jesus has already put in
   place. [I Cor. 3:11]

   The walls are the law or the care of angels; in the song of Isaiah: and
   after I had enclosed the walls and I had annexed the reeds, I planted a
   vineyard. [Is. 5:2 (unknown variant)]

   The house is the soul in which Christ lives or the church; in the
   psalm: let us go to the house of the Lord. [Ps. 121(122):1]

   The upper room is the height of the worthy or of knowledge; in the
   gospel: and he himself will show you a large upper room. [Luke 22:12]

   The door is the opening of faith; in the apostle: the large door was
   open to me that I might see. [I Cor. 16:9]

   The column is the mainstay or support of the spirit; in the apostle:
   James, John, and Cephas (Peter), who are seen to be the columns. [Gal.
   2:9]

   The wall [of a house] is the construction of good works; in the song of
   songs: behold, here past our wall, seeing through the windows. [Cant.
   2:9]

   The windows are the vision or perception of others; as above: seeing
   through the windows; the same in a bad part: death enters through your
   windows. [Cant. 2:9; Jer. 9:21]

   The step is the ascent of the spirit; in the title of the psalms: the
   songs of degrees. [Ps. 119(120):1 Vulgate]

   The floor is humility or the affliction of the spirit as if in a dip in
   the ground; in the psalm: my soul clings to the floor. [Ps. 118(119):25
   Vulgate]

   The lute is good works; in the psalm: a glad lute with a zither. [Ps.
   80(81):3(2) Vulgate]

   The zither is the breast of the devout, in which the nerves are
   virtues, in which is spiritual good; in the psalm: arise, lute and
   zither, that is, the works of faith; or it is about the resurrection of
   the Lord's body with divine strength. [Ps. 107(108):3(2)]

   The ten strings of a ten-stringed lute are the ten precepts or the five
   senses of the exterior man combined with the five of the interior; in
   the psalm: on a ten-stringed lute and a zither with a song. [Ps.
   91(92):4(3) Vulgate]

   A pipe is a man or the one who has gone up to God; in the psalm: praise

   prophet: your voice like a glad trumpet. [Is. 58:1]

   Cymbals are the lips that trust in the Lord or the love of God and the
   love of neighbor; in the psalm: praise Him with loud clanging cymbals.
   [Ps. 150:5]

   Celebration is noise expressed with spiritual fervor; in the psalm:
   praise Him with joyful cymbals. [Ps. 150:5]

   Egypt is this world or the gentiles; in the psalm: ambassadors will
   come from Egypt. [Ps. 67(68):32 Vulgate]

   Ethiopia is the church of the gentiles; in the psalm: let Ethiopia come
   before His hand; and the same in another part of the psalm: You gave
   food to the people of Ethiopia. [Ps. 67(68):32 Vulgate; Ps. 73(74):14
   Vulgate]

   Babylon is the world or Rome; in the apocalypse: and Babylon, great in
   memory, came before God, who gave her a cup of wine, the enormity of
   His anger. [Apoc. 16:19]

   Enemies are the devil or faults; in the psalm: let him not be confused,
   when he talks to his enemies at the gate. [Ps. 126(127):5]

   Thieves are heretics or pseudoprophets; in the gospel: all who come
   before me will have been thieves or robbers. [John 10:8]

   The gentiles are faults; in the Pentatuch: when the Lord, your God, led
   you into the land which you were going to possess by degrees and he
   destroyed many people in front of you. The same in another part: clap
   your hands, all you people. [Deut. 7:1; Ps. 46(47):2(1)]

   A battle is a contest between spiritual iniquity or a fight against
   faults; in the apostle: thus I fight but not like one that beats the
   air. [I Cor. 9:26]

   Peace is harmony between flesh and spirit; in the psalm: ask who in
   Jerusalem are of peace. [Ps. 121(122):6 (unknown variant)]

   Victory is triumph over the devil or over adeversity; in the apostle:
   give thanks to God who gives us victory through our lord Jesus Christ.
   [Ephes. 2:14]

   Wages are the reward of perfect work; in the apostle: I follow to the
   end, to the wages of the heavenly calling of God. [I Cor. 15:57]

   The crown is the wage of eternal glory for righteousness; in the
   apostle: as for the rest the crown of righteousness is laid on me.
   [Phil. 3:14]

   Because the fullness of spiritual perfection leads to the crown,
   rightly he perfects those to whom the crown is the spiritual names. We
   have led then to the difficulty of containing the spiritual names, such
   as these, that they may be drawn out whole, while they themselves sow
   the seeds of meaning in another part.

X. On Numbers

   In truth, we interpret, however briefly, these numbers of perfect
   names. The mystical account of these examples makes them more honored
   among the blessed.

   I. This number refers to the unity of the divinity; in the Pentatuch:
   hear, O Israel, the Lord your God is one. [Deut. 6:4]

   II. [This number refers] to the two testaments; in Kings: and He made
   in Dabir two cherubim in the measure of 10 cubits. [III(I) Kings 6:23]

   III. [This number refers] to the Trinity; in the epistle of John: three
   are those who bear witness: water, blood, and spirit. [I John 5:8]

   IV. [This number refers] to the four evangelists; in Ezekiel: and from
   the middle of them the likeness of four animals. [Ez. 1:5]

   V. [This number refers] to the five books of Moses; in the apostle: I
   wish to speak five words in the church with my mind. [I Cor. 14:19]

   VI. [This number refers] to the sixth day on which the Lord made man
   along with all the animals of the land; in Genesis: let us make man in
   our image and likeness; the same a little later: and it was done,
   evening and morning, the sixth day. [Gen. 1:26; Gen. 1:31]

   VII. [This number refers] to the seventh day on which God rested after
   all that He had done; in Genesis: and he rested on the seventh day from
   the whole work that he had accomplished. [Gen. 2:2]

   VIII. [This number refers] to the day of the Lord's resurrection, that
   is, the eighth day; in the title of a psalm: into the end for the
   eighth [Shemi-nith, the eighth part in Hebrew]. [Ps. 11(12):1 Vulgate]

   IX. [This number refers] to the sacrament because at the ninth hour the
   Lord let loose his Spirit; in the Gospel: about the ninth hour Jesus
   cried out in a loud voice. [Matt. 27:46]

   X. [This number refers] to the decalogue; in the psalm: I will sing to
   you with a ten-stringed lute. [Ps. 143(144):9]

   XII. [This number refers] to the apostles; in the gospel: these are the
   names of the twelve apostles. [Matt. 10:2]

   XIV. [This number refers] to the Lord's vow to the generations; in the
   gospel: from Abraham to David were in all fourteen generations. [Matt.
   1:17]

   XV. [This number refers] to the 15 steps of the temple.

   XVI. [This number refers] to the number of the prophets.

   XXII. [This number refers] to the promise of [the number of] divine
   books, according to the Hebrew alphabet.

   XXIV. [This number refers] to the mystery of the number of elders; in
   the Apocalypse: and on thrones twenty-four elders were sitting. [Apoc.
   4:4]

   XXX. [This number refers] to the fruit of faithful unions; in the
   gospel: and they gave fruit, some a hundredfold and others sixty- and
   thirtyfold. [Matt. 13:8]

   XXXIII. [This number refers] to the mystery of the age to which the
   Lord lived in the flesh; in the apostle, as can be seen from this:
   until we have become, in the unity of faith and in the suffering of the
   Son of God, perfect men in the measure of the age of the fullness of
   Christ. [Ephes. 4:13]

   XL. [This number refers] to the promise of Lent; in the gospel: and he
   was led by the spirit in the desert for forty days. [Luke 4:1-2]

   XLII. [This number refers] to the number of stopovers in the desert or
   to the number of generations from Abraham through the [birth of the]
   Lord Jesus Christ. [cf. Matt. 1]

   L. [This number refers] to the Pentecost; in the acts of the apostles:
   and when the days of Pentecost were completed. [Acts 2:1]

   LX. [This number refers] to the fruit to widows or to the debt to those
   who restrain passion; in the gospel: and another gave fruit sixtyfold.
   [Matt. 13:8]

   LXXII. [This number refers] to the number of elders of Moses or the
   number of disciples whom the Lord chose; in the gospel: after that the
   Lord named 72 others and sent them, before His own face, two by two
   into the whole world. [Luke 10:1]

   C. [This number refers] to the fruit of the martyrs or of the virgins;
   in the gospel: and others gave fruit a hundredfold. [Matt. 13:8]

   We have put forth, therefore, as examples those certain and holy
   numbers. Assuredly, more beyond these exist, and you will find that
   almost all, which are made by the very means of divine reading, are
   sacred.
