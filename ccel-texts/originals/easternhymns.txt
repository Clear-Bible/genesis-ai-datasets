PREFACE

   The generous reception given to a former series of renderings of Hymns
   from the Office Books of the Greek Church [1] by those who are best
   qualified to judge, and the gratifying fact that already no fewer than
   five pieces from that series have secured a place in the revised
   edition of one of our most valued permanent Hymnals, encourage the
   translator to pursue his work in this department of devotional
   literature.

   No apology is needed for this additional volume on a subject too little
   known, the contents of which are an earnest attempt to acquaint our
   people still further with the valuable praise literature of the Eastern
   Church.

   We are still far from realising the unity of the Church of Christ in
   the world, when that section of it which is historically nearest The
   Christ--which joins hands with Him and with His Apostles--is
   practically ignored. Why this should be, let our Christian scholars
   answer. About a year ago the Rev. R. M. Moorsom, of Winchester,
   published his Renderings of Church Hymns, containing, among others,
   twenty translations from the Service Books of the Eastern Church. For
   that valuable addition to our hymnody, the Christian Church in our land
   is under a debt of gratitude to Mr. Moorsom; but he and the very few
   others who have sought to interest the Church in a subject so rich and
   so attractive, have as yet but touched its fringe.

   Of the forty-six pieces in this volume, forty-two appear for the first
   time in English verse. While leaving critics to pass their verdict on
   the value of the work, the translator can yet justly claim to have made
   a substantial addition to our English hymnody from Eastern sources.

   The renderings have all been made from the Service Books, the edition
   used being the one printed at Venice,--with the exception of the
   Triodion, which belongs to the Athens edition.

   To enable any who are interested in the subject, and who may have
   access to the Service Books, to compare the renderings with the
   original text, the title of the book, and the number of the page where
   it can be seen, are given in each case.

   The Introductory chapters on the History, Sacraments, and Worship of
   the Church, are given in the hope that they may be the means of
   removing prejudices and misconceptions, and of awakening some degree of
   interest in the Eastern Church.

   For much of the information contained in these chapters the translator
   is indebted, among other works, to Neale's History of the Holy Eastern
   Church, Stanley's History of the Eastern Church, King's Rites and
   Ceremonies of the Greek Church, and Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the
   Roman Empire. But many of the facts were collected a few years ago
   during a residence in the East.

INTRODUCTION
     __________________________________________________________________

  I

   The Eastern Church is little known in the West, and it would seem that
   there is not much desire on our part to alter that condition of things.
   As the Eastern Hemisphere is separated from the Western by the Ural and
   Carpathian ranges, so is Eastern Christendom separated from Western
   Christendom, and more effectually, by the mountain barriers which our
   ignorance, prejudice, and indifference have set up. But it is well to
   remember the German proverb, Behind the mountains are also people, and
   that the people who are behind those mountains which have been the
   growth of centuries, form nearly one-fourth of the followers of the
   Faith of Christ, or about one hundred million souls.

   The causes which have led to this indifference on the part of the West
   towards the East are many, but there are two which might be mentioned
   as being perhaps the chief.

   (I.) The first of these is the inherent peculiarity of temperament,
   which finds its expression in habits of thought, and modes of action,
   in the East, against which the spirit of the West frets, and for which
   it has neither sympathy nor toleration. The quiet, meditative
   restfulness of the East--its satisfaction with past attainment in the
   matter of Doctrine and Worship, its wistful retrospective gaze upon
   magnificent accomplishment, which the experience of centuries of trial
   has only intensified, are totally alien to the active, speculative,
   hopeful spirit of the West. Attainment is the boast of the East, and in
   that it rests content. Progress, achievement, is the craze of the West.
   Those temperaments, so obviously diverse, have for long parted company.

   (II.) The other is the great Roman Church. Inspired with that spirit
   which commends itself to the Western mind--its activity, its aptitude
   to fit itself to the ever-changing circumstances of the times, its
   progressive spirit, its thirst for achievement--characteristics without
   which it could scarcely have survived amid the crash of falling empire,
   and the chaos of barbaric anarchy which marked its birth--that Church
   for the past nine centuries has obtruded itself upon our attention, and
   claimed, nay demanded, our consideration. It pervades the West, its
   advocates are ubiquitous, its influence is everywhere felt. It was a
   knowledge of that Church and a very real acquaintance with its spirit
   and methods, which enabled the reformers of the sixteenth and
   seventeenth centuries to successfully wage war with it; and we realise
   that, in these days, to retain our freedom we must keep ourselves in
   touch with it, and by full and fresh acquaintance continue armed
   against its persistent aggressiveness. We are out of touch with the
   East, at no point do we come in contact with it; we have nothing to
   fear, though we might have something to hope from it. But we are in the
   West, and whether we will or not the Roman Church is always with us,
   and unceasingly demands our attention. So the Eastern Church fades from
   our view: out of sight it is out of mind, and it is the Roman Church
   that bars our vision.

   But the Eastern Church deserves better at our hands than to be thus
   forgotten. In these days of unrest, when men's minds are unsettled on
   so many questions, a strange, alluring calm pervades our spirit when we
   overtop the barriers and look down upon the peace and quiet of Eastern
   Christendom. There, in all her pristine simplicity and attractiveness,
   as in the golden days of the Empire, as in the fierce conflict of the
   early middle ages when John of Damascus whetted the sword for the
   conflict, so now under the misrule and tyranny of the Turk, she holds
   in quiet restfulness the simple faith committed to her by the Apostles
   and Fathers, the same Church now as then.

   Do we forget that the Fathers of the Eastern Church formulated our
   doctrines, and shaped our Creed, guarding it in every item with jealous
   care? Do we forget that the Churches founded by the apostles in Syria
   and Asia Minor still hold by the apostolic doctrine, and are parts of
   that great Church? Do we forget that the creed framed at Nicea is
   practically our creed, even as it is the creed of the Eastern Church?
   Do we forget that with unbroken succession, from the dawn of
   Christianity down to the present day, the bishops of that Church have
   handed on the torch of truth? We reap the blessings of Eastern fidelity
   to Christian truth, and forget, or ignore, the source whence it came to
   us. The high-sounding pretensions of Rome hide the facts of the case
   from us, and Rome, the first great dissenter from the Catholic Church,
   would not only claim for herself what does not belong to her, but would
   brand as schismatic and heretic all who differ from her in doctrine or
   practice. What modern Christendom would have been, had the Roman schism
   of 1054 never taken place, it is difficult to conceive. The suggestion
   opens up to our minds an alluring prospect, for we cannot forget that
   the revolt of the reformed faith in the sixteenth century was not from
   the faith of the East, but from the Roman Church with its accumulation
   of intolerable abuse.

   Such thoughts should incline us sympathetically towards the Church of
   the East, and enable us to overtop the barriers which have been raised
   by incidents of history and unfounded prejudices and differences of
   temperament, which in no way affect the fact of our indebtedness to
   that Church, and consequently her claim upon our intelligent interest.

   But we are told that, after all, there is little difference between the
   Roman Church and the Greek Church--that the abuses of the one are the
   abuses of the other. That, we shall see shortly, is not the case. And
   we are told, too, that the Greek Church is a dead Church, and without
   missionary zeal. How a Church that has stretched out its hands to the
   farthest east, bestowing the blessings of the Gospel upon Tartar and
   Indian; southward, planting the Cross in Arabia, Persia, and Egypt;
   northward, diffusing light to the limits of Siberia, can be termed a
   non-missionary Church, is difficult to understand. How a Church that
   has fought hand to hand with idolatry, not only in the early ages when
   her spirit was young, but also during the past six centuries under the
   abominable superstition of the Turk, retaining her faith in Christ
   through it all, can be termed a dead Church, does not readily appear.
   No Church has provided more martyrs to the Christian Faith; and even
   during the course of the nineteenth century, in the Lebanon, at
   Damascus, throughout Syria, and in Armenia, men and women have chosen
   death rather than abandon their faith in Christ. If under persistent,
   unceasing persecution--not for generations, but for centuries--a Church
   can hold to its faith and maintain its testimony, the term dead cannot
   be applied to it. When in 1453 the Turk entered Constantinople, the
   history of the Greek empire was closed, but not that of the Church. She
   accepted the change of circumstances; and when her temples were
   despoiled, and her worship profaned, still held to her faith in Christ.
   If missionary zeal has languished, if life is faint in the midst of
   such experiences, is it to be wondered at? The struggle with oppression
   has been long, but now that the Ottoman Empire totters to its fall, the
   prospect brightens, and the Church which has so nobly maintained the
   conflict will doubtless reap her reward when the tyranny, which is
   meanwhile co-extensive with her beneficent sway, has for ever been
   removed.

   Prior to the great schism of 1054, when the See of Rome separated from
   the East, and the Pope excommunicated Michael Cerularius, Patriarch of
   Constantinople, in East and West, Christendom was practically one. The
   causes which led to that separation, which was fraught with momentous
   and far-reaching issues for Christianity, may be briefly referred to.
   They had their beginnings in the far past.

   The building of Constantinople in A.D. 330 by the Emperor Constantine
   on the site of the ancient Byzantium, and the subsequent transference
   of the seat of government to that city, were in reality the prime
   causes leading to that disagreement and alienation, which grew in
   intensity and broadened, till they reached the point of entire
   separation.

   Prior to that event, Byzantium was but one of the many Sees of the
   Eastern Church, but thereafter its rank rose with the rising importance
   of the city, till at the Council of Constantinople, A.D. 381, which
   closed the Arian controversy, the bishop of Constantinople was elevated
   to the second rank after the bishop of Rome, on the ground that
   Constantinople was the New Rome. No pre-eminence of jurisdiction was
   granted at that time, but it came in due course when, at the Council of
   Chalcedon, A.D. 451, the canon of A.D. 381, conferring second rank, was
   confirmed, and a range of jurisdiction granted. Against all this Rome,
   of course, protested emphatically, the Pope excommunicating the
   patriarchs of Constantinople and Alexandria, and for forty years the
   East and West were practically separated. At the end of that term,
   however, excommunication was withdrawn on the acknowledgment of the
   supremacy of Rome; but the estrangement continued and broadened. It was
   aided, on the one hand by the pride of the Greeks who plumed themselves
   on their unbroken succession from the Apostolic Church, their use of
   the language of the Apostles which was little known in the West, their
   introduction of Christianity into the West, and their formulation of
   Christian doctrine; and on the other hand, by the old spirit of Rome,
   which aspired to world-wide dominion both in Church and in State, and
   could ill brook rivalry on the part of the Greeks. The estrangement
   found its completion in 1054, when the addition of the word Filioque to
   the Latin creed, by which the Roman See expressed its belief in the
   doctrine of the double procession of the Holy Ghost--from the Father
   and the Son--a doctrine against which the Greek Church had emphatically
   protested, supplied the ground for a renewal of the quarrel which this
   time resulted in separation complete and final, Pope Leo IX.
   excommunicating the patriarch of Constantinople.

   The responsibility for the great schism undoubtedly lies with Rome, and
   that should be remembered for all time. The introduction of Filioque
   into the Creed was a proceeding by no means called for. Christians
   could quite well have lived and worked together without dogmatising on
   that particular; but a pretext had to be found, and Filioque supplied
   it.

  II

   Prior to the fall of the Empire in the middle of the fifteenth century,
   the Greek Church comprised within her borders, Greece, Illyricum
   (Dalmatia), the islands of the Archipelago; Russia; Asia Minor, Syria,
   and Palestine; Egypt, Nubia, and Abyssinia; Arabia, Persia, and
   Mesopotamia. After that disaster she fell into a dependent condition in
   those territories secured by the Turk. In the eighteenth century Russia
   claimed separation from Constantinople, and has been governed since by
   a Holy Synod; and when the new kingdom of Greece was established in the
   early part of last century, the Church there, in like manner, claimed a
   distinct organisation. Scattered portions of the Church, chiefly in
   Hungary, Servia, Bosnia, Bulgaria, and in Poland, which, while
   following the Greek rite, accepted the supremacy of the Pope, united
   themselves, A.D. 1590, to the Roman See. But those Uniat Greeks, as
   they were termed, after 250 years, returned to the Eastern Church, in
   part associating themselves with the Russian Church, and in part with
   the See of Constantinople. Servia has now its own Metropolitan.

   At the present time, the Eastern Church may be thus grouped--

          I. The Greek Church proper.
          II. The Heretical Churches.
          III. The Russian Church.

   I. The Greek Church comprises those peoples who speak the Greek
   language. Among these are the independent Church of Greece, the
   Apostolic Churches of Asia Minor, and those Uniats in the northern part
   of the Balkan Peninsula who returned to their former allegiance to the
   Patriarch of Constantinople. In this group we may also include the
   independent Church of Servia.

   II. The Heretical Churches are self-supporting Churches in the
   countries in which they are situated. They are termed heretical on
   account of their revolt from the jurisdiction of Constantinople. They
   hold with the rest of the Church to the doctrine of the Nicene creed as
   drawn up at the first two Councils, but reject the decisions of the
   subsequent Councils. They are the Churches in Egypt, Syria, and
   Armenia, and in those countries known as Kurdistan.

   The causes which gave rise to those so-called Heretical Churches are
   not a little interesting, but cannot be gone into here at any length.
   They may, however, be referred to as shewing the relation of the
   Churches of the East to the various Councils.

   The Heretical Churches of the East owe their existence to the actions
   of the General Councils subsequent to the Councils of Nicea and
   Constantinople. At these the doctrines accepted by Orthodox and
   Heretical Churches alike were distinctly expressed. But when to the
   decisions of those Councils there came to be added the decrees of
   succeeding Councils, certain Churches revolted. Those universally
   accepted doctrines were that Christ was consubstantial with the Father
   (homoousios), and that He, the Son of God, became man (enanthropesas).
   It was, however, only when theologians tried to make plain what was
   meant by the latter phrase, that it prickled with disputable points.
   The differences of opinion emerging took two types. One of these so
   thoroughly divided the Divine from the human nature in Christ, as
   almost to destroy altogether any real union. Another insisted on an
   absorption of the human in the Divine, such as would disfigure both,
   and by that absorption create a distinct nature. The former, the
   separation of the natures, became the doctrine of the Churches of
   Chaldea, while the latter was adopted by the Churches of Egypt.

   The Nestorians in like manner accept the decrees of the first two
   Councils, and refuse to entertain the additions made by the latter
   Councils, characterising them as unwarranted alterations of, or
   additions to the findings of the first two Councils. The Monophysites
   accept the addition of Chalcedon and of all the Councils following it.

   The third General Council, that of Ephesus, decreed that the title
   Theotokos (God-bearer) should be applied to the Virgin, and at the
   Council of Chalcedon this was repeated, affirming that Christ was born
   of the Theotokos, according to the manhood; the same Symbol affirming
   that two natures are to be acknowledged in Christ, and that they are
   indivisible and inseparable. Thus it was that the Nestorians repudiated
   the decrees alike of Ephesus and Chalcedon, by repudiating the term
   Theotokos and holding the duality of Christ's nature so as to lose
   sight of the unity of His Person.

   There was nothing for it, therefore, but to separate from the Greek
   Church (orthodox), and in separation from that Church they became most
   extensive and powerful.

   At the Council of Chalcedon, the fourth General Council, the now widely
   acknowledged doctrine in all the Churches of the West, as also in the
   Orthodox Greek Church, was declared, that Christ was to be acknowledged
   in two natures. The Monophysites--those who held by the one nature
   theory--revolted, and gave rise to many sects, and to three
   Churches--the Coptic Church of Egypt, the Abyssinian Church, and the
   Jacobite Church of Syria. [2]

   The Armenian Church is in much the same position; but it has been
   termed even more heretical than the Jacobite, a very erroneous charge
   against a Church which is really orthodox. The Armenian Church is
   separated from the Constantinopolitan by the difference which the
   accidental absence of the Armenian bishop from the Council of Chalcedon
   made: the decisions of which were never understood, and of course never
   formally accepted.

   III. The Russian Church includes the peoples of that great Empire.
   Christianity was first preached in Russia at the close of the tenth
   century, when Prince Vladimir was baptised, A.D. 992. Originally, and
   for many years this Church, subject to the Patriarch of Constantinople,
   as already stated, claimed separate jurisdiction in 1721. The Czar is
   the head of the Church in temporalities, but the Holy governing Synod
   is the spiritual head, and supplies the place of a patriarch.

   Under so many jurisdictions, the Eastern Church is dogmatically one.
   She has no Confession of Faith; no Thirty-nine Articles: the Bible is
   her standard, and the Creed of Nicea her expression of dogma.

   The Athanasian Creed is found in the Service Books of the Church, but
   it is not an acknowledged Symbol; and there it differs from the text
   accepted in the West in the clause relating to the Holy Spirit.

   In common with the Roman Church, the Greek Church has seven Sacraments.
   These are--the Eucharist, Baptism, the Holy Chrism, Penance, Matrimony,
   Unction of the Sick, and Ordination.

   Holy Communion.--In relation to this Sacrament, as indeed to all the
   Sacraments of the Eastern Church, it is necessary to say that, doctrine
   being in an altogether undefined state, an outsider has considerable
   difficulty in realising, in any degree of certainty, what the attitude
   of mind generally of the Church is, or more exactly ought to be. One
   cannot help feeling that without the mental subtleness of the East, and
   the atmosphere and environment of its worship, it is impossible to
   understand, so as to express it, how this Sacrament is viewed. Eastern
   theology has not been systematised, and could not be--such subtleties
   and nice distinctions abound, as would defy systematising.

   And nowhere as in this Sacrament do we feel this difficulty more.
   Transubstantiation as we understand it, and as it is held in the West,
   is nowhere a doctrine of belief in the Eastern Church, although the
   language of the service may seem emphatic, and quite unmistakable.
   Under the operation of the Holy Spirit--not as in the West, after the
   formula of institution (and this is an important difference) the bread
   and wine become the precious Body and the precious Blood of our Lord;
   and when they are partaken of, are as fire and light in us, consuming
   the substance of sin, and burning the tares of our passions. That all
   seems plain enough. But what is the nature of this change? In the
   Western Church the material on the altar--the bread and the wine--are
   actually changed into the Body and the Blood: they are materially no
   longer bread and wine: the bread and wine have disappeared, and the
   Body and Blood of Christ have taken their place. They are, as the term
   expresses it, transubstantiated.

   That is not the view of the Greek Church. The bread and the wine do not
   change their substance: they are bread and wine, nothing more, to the
   end, with this difference, it is a subtle one, doubtless, that the Body
   and Blood of Christ under the operation of the Holy Ghost are there IN
   that bread and wine. There is, if we might so express it,
   Insubstantiation. The materials are not changed, but the Body and Blood
   of Christ are there.

   As a rule, persons go to Holy Communion once a year, shortly after
   confession. The laity communicate in both kinds, and in this particular
   the Eastern Church differs from the Western, which withholds the cup
   from the laity. In other particulars the two Churches differ. The wine
   is mixed twice, not once; the Sacrament is received standing, not
   kneeling; and the bread is ordinary leavened bread, not unleavened. As
   noticed in connection with baptism, infants after that Sacrament
   partake of the cup, and continue to do so till they reach their seventh
   year. At that age they are expected to go to Confession, and thereafter
   they communicate in both kinds.

   There are three methods of communion practised in the Eastern Church,
   (1) Giving the bread first, and thereafter the cup, as is the uniform
   custom in the West. (2) The priest gives the bread, and the deacon
   gives the wine with a spoon. (3) The bread is broken into crumbs, and
   put into the wine, and both are given together in a spoon.

   Before the people separate, the priest distributes the Antidoron. The
   bread of the Eucharist is called the Gift, and the portion which is
   afterwards distributed is for the use of those who have not
   communicated, and is given in place of the gift. It is carried home,
   and may be used by the person himself, or given to any who are sick, or
   who for other reasons were absent from the celebration, and is partaken
   of fasting. The services both before and after Communion are in many
   cases exceedingly beautiful.

   Baptism.--The Eastern Church observes infant baptism, but insists on
   trine immersion--in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
   Holy Ghost. A priest is the celebrant; but in cases of sudden and
   serious illness any orthodox person may perform the rite. In the event,
   however, of the sick person recovering, a priest must fill in and
   complete the office.

   The form of the service is briefly as follows. The child having been
   brought to church, is anointed with oil, which has been blessed for the
   purpose by the priest, on the breast and back, and on the ears, hands,
   and feet. Then follows the profession of the faith in which the child
   is baptized. The water of baptism is thereafter blessed, and the child
   immersed three times.

   The Holy Chrism is the Sacrament of Confirmation in the Eastern Church,
   and it differs considerably from the Western rite. This Sacrament is
   given immediately after baptism, not as in the West when the child has
   come to years of discernment, and in nearly every case by the ordinary
   priest. Oil is again used, the priest anointing the baptised person
   with it, making the sign of the Cross--on the forehead, eyes, nostrils,
   mouth, ears, breast, hands, and feet. Thereafter the child partakes of
   the wine of the Holy Communion.

   Penance.--In the Greek Church Confession has never assumed the
   objectionable features which so largely characterise that Sacrament in
   the Roman Church. It is, as far as it can be made such, a means of
   grace; and when used in a right and proper spirit, helpful to a degree.
   To quote from a catechism of the Russian Church, "Penance is a mystery,
   in which he who confesses his sins is, on the outward declaration of
   the priest, immediately loosed from his sins by Jesus Christ Himself."
   Or in the language of a former Metropolitan of Moscow--"Confession is a
   mystery in which sins are forgiven by God, through the means of the
   priest, to the faithful, when these confess them unreservedly, and
   believe unhesitatingly in the merits of Christ." At the age of seven
   every child is expected to come to Confession and to continue coming
   four times a year ever thereafter.

   When the priest has offered up prayer supplicating the mercy of God,
   the penitent confesses his sins, craving pardon from the just and
   merciful God, and grace to sin no more. The confessor addressing the
   penitent reminds him that he has come to God with his sins, and does
   not confess to man but to God. After he has been dealt with in all
   faithfulness, the priest tells him that he himself is also an unworthy
   sinner, and has no power to forgive sins, but relying on the Word of
   Christ, "Whosesoever sins ye remit," says, "God forgive thee in the
   world that now is, and in that which is to come."

   Penance is prescribed only for mortal sins; for venial sins absolution
   alone is given, the penitent kneeling while being absolved, although
   during confession he sat.

   Matrimony.--The first duty of the priest towards persons contemplating
   marriage is to instruct them in the Ten commandments, the Lord's
   Prayer, and the Creed. Notice of intended marriage is announced in
   church some weeks prior to the event, and the ceremony is carried out
   in church before witnesses.

   The Office for Matrimony has two parts, one dealing with betrothal, and
   the other with the marriage. These may be performed at the same time,
   or separately, as the case may demand.

   Taking the betrothal first. After prayer for blessing upon the persons,
   the priest takes two rings, one of gold and one of silver, and giving
   the ring of gold to the man says, "A., the servant of God, is betrothed
   to B., the handmaid of God, in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
   and of the Holy Ghost, now and ever and to the ages of ages, Amen."
   Afterwards taking the silver ring, and giving it to the woman, he says,
   "B., the handmaid of God," etc. The godfather then changes the rings,
   giving the gold ring to the woman, and the silver ring to the man, an
   expressive act, proclaiming to the bridegroom that he must learn to
   accommodate himself to the weakness of the bride, and that she has now
   become sharer of his goods. Then follows the Coronation, or marriage
   proper. After words of instruction and prayer, the priest takes the
   crowns, and first of all crowns the bridegroom, saying, "A., the
   servant of God, is crowned for B., the handmaid of God, in the name of
   the Father," etc. Then he crowns the bride, using the same formula. The
   words are repeated three times in each case, the sign of the Cross
   being made each time. The crowns are, as a rule, the property of the
   Church, and according to the wealth or poverty of the people are made
   of precious metal or of tin. The priest then takes the common cup and
   gives to the bridegroom first, and then to the bride, to drink. Later,
   the priest removes the crowns, and after prayer the friends come
   forward with their congratulations, the bridegroom and the bride kiss
   each other, and the priest pronounces the dismissal.

   Second and third marriages, while allowed, are not looked upon with
   favour, and the Church shows its disapprobation in several ways. They
   are not crowned, and the words of the service for such marriages have
   subtle allusions to their unworthiness. The priest prays, "Give unto
   them the conversion of the publican, the tears of the harlot, and the
   confession of the thief, that through repentance they may be deemed
   worthy of Thy Heavenly Kingdom." The priest does not present Himself at
   the wedding feast, nor are the parties allowed to partake of the
   Sacraments of the Church for the space of two years. Fourth marriages
   are unlawful.

   Unction of the Sick.--This Sacrament must not be confounded with the
   Sacrament of Extreme Unction of the Roman Church. It has its authority
   in the injunction of the Apostle James--"Is any sick among you? let him
   call for the elders of the Church; and let them pray over him,
   anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord." The oil is consecrated
   for the purpose by seven priests, and the Sacrament is not administered
   unless several priests, usually three, are present. This rule is
   founded on the use of the plural number by St. James. If possible, the
   rite is observed in church, but where that is impossible, in the house.
   According to the Scriptural direction, the priest anoints the sick with
   oil, and prays God to forgive him, and to cure the body and the soul.
   In cases of extreme urgency the Communion is thereafter given to the
   sick.

   Ordination.--This Sacrament, giving as it does a place in the
   succession with apostolic authority, is most jealously guarded. But
   before speaking of Ordination, it may be useful in the first place to
   give some description of the vestments worn in the Greek Church, and
   with which the clergy are robed according to their rank. The origin of
   the vestments in use in the Greek Church certainly affords much
   difficulty. It is more than likely that they present fundamentally the
   dress of the early Greek of comparatively high social standing in
   apostolic times, with certain very important modifications and
   additions.

   We can find no trace of vestments of any kind whatsoever in the
   Apostolic Church. The garments worn by the apostles and their
   companions in work would be the dress of the ordinary Greek of fairly
   high social standing. During the first three centuries, in which
   Christianity suffered so much at the hands of her enemies, we cannot
   think of much alteration on dress taking place in the case of the
   ministers of religion--men had something else to think about. But
   quieter times came, and no doubt the alterations would then be made to
   which we have referred; and we can fancy that in making those
   alterations regard would be had to symbolism, and that garments to
   suggest certain facts and functions would be brought into use. In
   making those modifications and additions there can be little doubt that
   the vestments of the Jewish priesthood with their symbolism would be,
   as far as possible, approximated.

   That those vestments in the early centuries were purely what they now
   are, ecclesiastical vestments, we very much doubt. It is more likely
   that for some time they constituted what we would term the ordinary
   everyday clerical dress.

   The first vestment, and that which is common to every order, is the
   Stoicharion, which corresponds to the Alb in use in the West. It is a
   white tunicle, not now of linen as formerly, but of silk. The
   Epimanikia, or hand-pieces, were formerly made in the shape of the
   sleeves of a surplice, but are now considerably contracted. They hang
   down on each side of the arm, and are drawn close to it by cords which
   are fastened tightly round the wrist. The significance of the vestment
   is not apparent. They are said to represent the cords with which Christ
   was bound before being delivered to Pilate. Formerly, only bishops wore
   the Epimanikia, but now they are worn by all ranks.

   The Orarion, or praying vestment, is peculiar to the deacon. It is
   identical with the Latin Stole, and is thrown over the left shoulder.
   Its significance is obscure, but it has been represented as symbolising
   wings, the ministry of the deacon being angelical. Those three
   vestments constitute the dress of the deacon. The priest has the
   Stoicharion and the Epimanikia, but instead of the Orarion the
   Epitrachelion. This vestment is not unlike the stole, but of a
   different shape. It is not thrown round the neck hanging down the front
   in two pieces. The head of the priest passes through a hole of
   sufficient size, and the vestment hangs in front in one piece. Whether
   it symbolises the easy yoke of Christ we cannot say. The Zone is the
   next article of vestment, and is worn to bind the Stoicharion and the
   Epitrachelion together round the waist.

   The Phaenolion.--This word is translated cloke in I. Tim., iv. 13, and
   as a vestment represents the garment which Paul left at Troas with
   Carpus. It is the Latin Chasuble, but is now much reduced in
   dimensions. Those five vestments constitute the dress of a priest. The
   bishop, in addition to the five just mentioned, with the exception of
   the Phaenolion, for which is substituted the Saccos which represents
   the robe in which Christ was mocked, has two other vestments, making
   seven in all. They are the Omorphiona, or Pall. It is fastened round
   the neck, and is larger than the Latin Dalmatic; and the Epigonation,
   which is a small ornament made of brocade, or some such stiff material,
   and of a diamond shape. It is worn hanging at the right side, and may
   represent the towel with which Christ girded Himself, or if a sword,
   may be typical of the victory of the Church over sin. No doubt the
   latter is the correct interpretation, as the words spoken, when it is
   assumed, would indicate, "Gird Thy sword on Thy thigh, O Thou most
   Mighty."

   The office of Ordination is exceedingly simple and most expressive, and
   varies according to the rank of the candidate. The minor orders are
   those of Reader, Singer, Sub-Deacon, and Deacon. If the candidate be a
   Reader, he is brought to the bishop, who counsels him regarding his
   duties, and laying his hand upon his head prays over him, ordaining him
   to his order. He is then robed in the Stoicharion and a copy of the
   Epistles is put into his hand. If a Singer, he is robed in like manner,
   and a copy of the Psalter is put into his hand. The office for a
   Sub-Deacon is more elaborate, as his rank is higher than that of a
   Reader or a Singer. He is set apart for the exercise of his functions
   with prayer and counsel, and is robed with the Stoicharion and Zone.
   The Order of Deacon is a much more important one in the East than in
   the West. He has duties in connection with the celebration of the
   Eucharist, as we have already seen, which he alone can perform. He is
   vested, in addition to the Stoicharion and Zone, with the Orarion, or
   Stole, which he wears over his left shoulder.

   The higher orders begin with the priest. In his case the Orarion is
   exchanged for the Epitrachelion, and the service is arranged to suit
   the peculiar functions of his order. The additional higher orders
   are--Proto-presbyter, Abbot, Archimandrite, Bishop, and Metropolitan or
   Patriarch. It should be stated that the lower grades are necessary
   steps to the higher ones, and are, as a rule, permanent.

   Unlike the Roman Church, which demands the celibacy of the clergy, the
   Eastern Church requires of all orders of her parochial clergy that they
   should be married prior to ordination. Bishops, who, as a rule, are
   chosen from the monasteries, and are consequently celibates, continue
   in that state, although a married bishop has not been unknown in the
   Eastern Church. The practice is founded on the words of St. Paul to
   Timothy, "A Bishop must be ... the husband of one wife," which they
   take literally, in a sense which we do not attach to them. Before,
   therefore, orders can be conferred, the candidate must be married, and
   if during his incumbency his wife should die, he must give up his
   parochial duties and retire to a monastery. He cannot put himself right
   with this requirement of Church discipline by marrying again, for "A
   bishop must be ... the husband of one wife." If, as we are bound to
   infer from that prohibition, he is deemed the husband of one wife even
   after his wife is dead, it is difficult to understand on what principle
   he is obliged to abandon his duties, seeing that he has fulfilled the
   apostolic requirement. Such is the practice of the Church: he must be
   married once, and his wife must be alive during the whole term of his
   incumbency. We must however bear in mind the objection which the
   Eastern Church has to second marriages generally, which, while not
   prohibited, are stigmatised; and perhaps in this objection is to be
   found the explanation of the general rule.

   One other rank should be mentioned--that of Deaconess or Abbess. It
   ranks above that of Deacon, and was instituted in order to bring
   conventual establishments, over which they are set, directly under
   Episcopal jurisdiction.

   The minor rites, canons, and offices, and special prayers of the
   Eastern Church, are too numerous to be dealt with here. Suffice it to
   say, that there is no event of ecclesiastical importance which has not
   its appropriate rite, and scarcely an experience of life for which some
   provision has not been made in the magnificent services of the Church.

   One office of universal interest, however, we must refer to shortly,
   viz., that for Burial. There are five Burial offices in the
   Euchologion--for a monk, for a priest, for a child, and for laymen
   (two). It may serve our purpose to take the last as a specimen.

   The office begins with the following instruction:--"On the death of one
   of the orthodox, straightway the relatives send for the priest, who,
   when he is come to the house in which the remains lie, assumes the
   Epitrachelion, and burning incense gives the blessing, and the
   relatives, as is usual, say the Trisagion, the Most Holy Trinity, and
   the Lord's Prayer." After certain troparia are sung, and prayer
   offered, the remains are carried to the church and placed in the
   narthex (page 52). The service, which is long and varied, and most
   impressive, is made up of scriptural lessons--Psalm i.; The Beatitudes;
   John v. 24; I. Thess. iv. 13-17; prayers; The Canon of the Dead, which
   contains eight odes written by Theophanes (eighth century), and the
   idiomela of John the Monk--presumably John of Damascus--eight in
   number, the first of which is given in this volume. Towards the close
   of the service, the priest bows down and kisses the corpse, in which
   act he is followed by the relatives and friends present. Then the
   stichera of the last kiss, said to have been written by John of
   Damascus, are sung, followed by the idiomela. After the priest has
   given the prayer of absolution, the body is carried to the grave
   followed by the mourners, the clergy going before chanting the
   Trisagion. When the remains have been laid in the grave, the priest
   takes some earth on a shovel, and scatters it crosswise on the body,
   saying, "The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof, the world and
   they that dwell therein." After the corpse oil has been poured upon the
   remains the grave is covered, while certain troparia are sung. This
   office in certain parts is very striking. The stichera of the last
   kiss, of which a rendering can be seen in Neale's [37]Hymns of the
   Eastern Church, and the idiomela, which follow, being specially
   noteworthy.

   It is deserving of note that the Eastern Church has a special office
   for the burial of little children--an appreciation of the honour
   conferred upon them by Christ in His kingdom, and an acknowledgment of
   the importance of the child-like spirit, as constituting an essential
   qualification on the part of those who would enter that kingdom, very
   beautiful indeed. A rendering of certain stichera from this office is
   included in this volume.

   The following is a typical plan, roughly drawn, of a Greek church.

   Typical plan of a Greek Church

   1. The Bema; 2. The Altar; 3. The Prothesis; 4. The Diaconicon; 5. The
   Iconostasis; 6. Doors; 7. The Ambon; 8. The Nave; 9. The Narthex.

   From this plan it will be seen at a glance that a Greek Church consists
   of four parts: (1) The Bema or Sanctuary, which contains the altar, and
   on either side the Prothesis and the Diaconicon. From the choir the
   Sanctuary is separated by the Iconostasis, which answers to the altar
   rails in a Roman Church. (2) In front of the Iconostasis is the Choir,
   not architecturally separated from the Nave, but occupying the eastern
   end of it. (3) The Nave. (4) The Narthex. In some of the larger
   churches there are two Nartheces--the esonarthex and the exonarthex,
   the latter serving the purpose of an extended porch.

   To look at the arrangement and detail of the church more particularly--

   The (hagion bema) Bema or Sanctuary, for the due celebration of the
   Holy Mysteries, occupies the eastern end of the church. Only priests
   are allowed to enter the Bema, and by them it can be entered only after
   fasting and prayer. The altar which stands in the Bema is built of
   stone, Christ being the Head of the Corner, and the Foundation Stone,
   and is furnished with candles, a copy of the Scriptures, and the Cross.

   The Prothesis, to the north of the Bema, is a small chapel, on the
   table of which the sacred offerings are prepared for the altar. The
   chapel of the Prothesis is separated from the Bema by a wall to which
   entrance is had by a screened doorway.

   The Diaconicon is to the south of the Bema, and contains the sacred
   utensils and vestments. It is of inferior sanctity, but the clergy of
   the lower orders are not allowed to enter it.

   The Iconostasis is the screen which separates the sanctuary from the
   choir, and is so called for the reason that certain icons or pictures
   are depicted on it. It is of panelled wood, sufficiently high to hide
   the interior of the sanctuary from the worshippers. In some cases it is
   simply a curtain of some cloth fabric. It has three doors leading to
   the Prothesis, to the Bema, and to the Diaconicon. On either side of
   the door giving entrance to the Bema are the icons of our Lord and of
   the Virgin Mother--the one to the right and the other to the left.
   Other icons are displayed over the screen, which in many cases is quite
   a work of art.

   In front of the Iconostasis is the choir, and opposite the Holy door
   leading to the Bema is the Ambon, from which the reader recites the
   scriptures, and from which, on special occasions, sermons are
   delivered.

   The Nave is that part of the church designed for the accommodation of
   the male portion of the congregation.

   The Narthex gives accommodation to catechumens and penitents, where the
   Gospels can be heard, but from which the celebration of the Mysteries
   cannot be witnessed. Late comers usually content themselves with a
   place in the Narthex in order not to disturb the service. The Narthex
   is in some cases vaulted, as are also the aisles, so called, over which
   are galleries for the accommodation of the female portion of the
   congregation; where these are awanting, women are accommodated in the
   Narthex, as the division of the sexes during worship is rigidly
   maintained.

   There are no seats in a Greek Church, as the recognised posture during
   worship is standing. In some churches narrow stalls are built in which
   the worshipper can stand, leaning forward, and resting his elbows
   during the long service; and in a church which the writer visited some
   years ago in Constantinople, there were in those stalls narrow ledges
   upon which the knee can be rested. Organs are not used in the services;
   but as the greater part of the service is chanted by the singers, vocal
   music in some cases is carried to great perfection.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The services of the Church are contained in seventeen quarto volumes of
   closely printed matter. Of these, from a Western point of view, the
   most important would seem to be:

   The Euchologion, which contains the offices of S. Chrysostom and S.
   Basil, and those for Baptism, Burial, etc.

   The Triodion and Pentecostarion contain the services for Lent and the
   three Sundays preceding it, and for Pentecost. Those two volumes
   contain the most attractive of all the services of the Church, and
   their hymnody, which includes much of the work of S. John of Damascus,
   is incomparable in the whole range of the service books.

   The Horologion contains the offices for the eight canonical hours.

   The Parakletike or Greater Octoechus, containing the ferial office, is
   also very rich in hymnody.

   The Menaea, of which there are twelve volumes, one for each month of
   the year, contain the services for saints' days. Service books so many
   and so voluminous, obviously cannot be in the hands of the people, but
   it is remarkable to what extent their bulk and intricacies are
   mastered.
     __________________________________________________________________

  VI

   The veneration of saints and relics took its rise on the overthrow of
   paganism at the time of Constantine. It was very natural that those who
   had suffered martyrdom at the hands of pagan persecutors should at that
   time be remembered; and so it came to pass that churches were
   considered honoured above all others which contained the relics of
   those martyrs. The bones of Christ's witnesses were removed from their
   lonely graves, where they had lain long neglected, and were deposited
   under Christian altars. Saint's days were appointed upon which their
   deeds were rehearsed and their lives commemorated. From a veneration of
   the saints it was a short step to their invocation, and what helped the
   Church to take that step was the difficulty felt by men in regarding
   Jesus Christ as being at once God, and the Mediator between God and
   man.

   The chief of saints is the Mother of our Lord after the flesh. The
   title applied to her--Mother of God--is quite intelligible, when we
   recollect the strife of the Arian controversy, and the determination of
   the Church to maintain the eternity of the Son and His equality with
   God.

   Saint worship is not countenanced: saints are venerated and invoked,
   but not worshipped. Ignorant people in the East, even as is the case
   with ignorant and superstitious people in the West, in all Churches,
   fall into divers errors; but the invocation of the saints is quite
   intelligible to the ordinarily instructed minds in the Church, and in
   their view in no way robs the Three One God of the worship and glory
   that are due to Him alone.

   There are no images in Eastern churches. The onslaught of the
   iconoclasts of the ninth century stripped Eastern worship of much that
   beautified and embellished it, but icons, or sacred pictures remained,
   and are held in as profound veneration, as is the image of any saint in
   the Church of the West. The icons are very varied in their
   representations. They represent our Lord and Joseph and Mary; the
   apostles, saints, and martyrs; and some of them depict interesting
   incidents from the scriptures. Prayers are said before them, that a
   devotional spirit may be aroused and sustained by the scene depicted.
   In the commoner churches those icons are in many cases miserable daubs,
   but in some of the larger and wealthier churches, and in many of the
   older buildings where they are executed in mosaic, they are often works
   of the highest art.

   Unlike the Roman Church, the Greek Church claims no infallibility.
   Works of supererogation are not allowed, and there are consequently no
   grants of indulgence or dispensations. The state of the dead is
   final--the souls of the departed passing at once into a state of bliss
   or torment. Purgatory therefore is disallowed, and prayers for the dead
   are but a pious custom, by which the memory of the departed is kept
   fresh.
     __________________________________________________________________

  VII

   From all this, and from what went before, it must be very obvious to
   everyone that more than the Filioque contention separates the Greek
   from the Roman Church. They are diverse in spirit and totally
   irreconcilable in doctrine and practice. They are in reality two
   Churches--have been so from the first, and must to all appearance
   continue so to the end. Nor are we very hopeful that more than a very
   sympathetic interest in the great apostolic Church can ever result from
   an increased knowledge of that Church on the part of the Reformed
   communions of the West--and surely that may be attained; but we must
   look beyond the self-assertive Roman Church, and by earnest enquiry
   seek to acquaint ourselves with its history, doctrine, and practice.
   Such a study will reward us by creating a lasting bond of sympathy with
   that Church, and by broadening our outlook, which has in the past been
   too much confined within the limits of the horizon bounding our own
   communion--a narrowing and pride engendering condition in truth. And
   from the varied contents of the voluminous service books of the Greek
   Church--the work of devoted men in the early centuries, who lived so
   near to the source of our common Christianity--may be culled many
   flowers with which to beautify the temple of God in these latter days.
   A specimen of what those books contain may be seen in the contents of
   this volume.
     __________________________________________________________________

  VIII

   It is a very remarkable fact, and certainly not to our credit, that,
   with the exception of a very few who have made the study a specialty,
   our educated men shew a most unaccountable ignorance of the most
   attractive and valuable material for praise and prayer contained in the
   service books of the Greek Church. We have learning far more than
   enough, and zeal enough for the pursuit of study in other departments,
   but this unworked field lies fallow, and no one thinks it worth his
   while to cultivate it. That the study will reward the student, although
   not in a material sense--for the meaningless prejudice of the great
   mass of our people for what is local, and against the thought of the
   stranger, no matter how beautiful it may be, has still to be reckoned
   with--yet in the highest sense as conferring upon him a new delight,
   there can be no doubt; for after the necessary expenditure of patient
   application, and the passing of the initiatory stages, which in every
   department of study are somewhat trying, the attraction will begin, and
   the subject become positively fascinating. To any one having the
   lyrical gift, and the necessary qualifications for the study of Greek,
   those service books might prove a mine of treasure inexhaustible. In
   the seventeen quarto volumes which contain the Greek Offices, there
   must be material of one kind or another for many thousands of hymns;
   yet when hymnal compilers ask for hymns from the Greek for their
   collections, they are not to be had save in the few renderings made by
   [38]Dr. Neale.

   We have not treated the Latin Church after that fashion. There is not a
   hymn of real merit in the Latin which has not been translated, and in
   not a few cases oftener than once, with the result that the gems of
   Latin hymnody are the valued possession of the Christian Church in all
   English-speaking lands.

   One does not proceed far without making some discoveries which may
   account, to a certain extent, for the neglect of Greek hymnody by those
   men who are best qualified to pursue the study of it. The writers are
   not poets in the true sense, and their language is not Greek as we have
   known it. None of the hymn writers in the service books, or out of
   them, is a poet of more than ordinary merit; although when John of
   Damascus forgets his adversaries, and dispenses with his rhythmical
   peculiarities, and gives forth the utterance of his deep devotional
   nature, he proves himself to be worthy of the title--The greatest of
   Greek Christian Poets.

   The Greek language lived long and died slowly, and the Christian hymn
   writers wrote in its decadence. It was then an instrument that had lost
   its fineness and keenness and polish, not the language of the men whose
   thoughts still charm the world, and who, by its deft use, gained for
   themselves and for their work immortality. It has little of the
   subtlety and suggestiveness of expression, the variety of cadence, and
   the intellectual possibility of the Greek of the classical writers. It
   was a language, moreover, crippled by the introduction of
   ecclesiastical and theological terms and phrases, which stubbornly
   refuse to lend themselves to classical rhythm. Such a language cannot
   be expected to have attraction for men to whom the classical poets are
   a delight.

   But it may be objected that Latin hymnody was also produced when the
   language was in a state of decadence. That is doubtless a statement of
   fact. But here again we are brought face to face with the dominant
   influence and age-long sovereignty of the Roman Church in the West, and
   with the fact that we have derived very largely from her, and to a much
   less appreciable extent from the Eastern Church. The Roman Church, with
   all that she had to give, laid hold of the West, and the Eastern
   Church, lying beyond the mountains, was forgotten.

   The hymns of the Greek Church are still in rhythmical prose--strangely
   oriental in structure--with the exception of those by John of Damascus,
   which are in iambics; and difficulties confront one on every page. What
   lines will reward the work of rendering? Prayer, Gospel, psalm, hymn,
   and exhortation follow each other, and are sometimes strangely
   interlaced. Where does one begin and another end? Then there is
   meaningless repetition which must be passed over, and expressions
   demanding modification. The symbolism is extravagant, and sometimes a
   single hymn is crowded with figures the most grotesque. Sifting and
   pruning are needed before a cento can be formed which would commend
   itself to modern taste.

   But when all has been said, there remains much that is both beautiful
   and attractive. Some of the hymns and fragments are most chaste and
   tender in their simple expression of Gospel truths, which are so
   attractive to all true hearts, no matter by what creed dominated.

   The remarkable simplicity characterising those hymns, constitutes,
   strangely it may seem, no small difficulty for the translator. The mere
   rendering of them into English prose is a comparatively easy task, and
   can be of no value to any one but the specialist; but to take the
   unmeasured lines and cut them to form stanzas, and in the process
   sacrifice nothing of their spirit to the exigencies of rhyme and
   rhythm, is a task by no means easy. But such drawbacks and difficulties
   are by no means insurmountable, and with the growing interest in
   hymnody which characterises our time, it will be strange if, in the
   years to come, the Greek service books are not made to yield their
   tribute to the praise of the Christian Church in the West.

   The hymns of the service books have a variety of characteristics, and
   are distinguished by terms, the meaning of which in some cases being
   extremely vague, and in others to be derived from the subject of the
   hymn, or from its form, or perhaps from the time, place, or manner in
   which it is sung. As we have no corresponding words in our language for
   the greater number of these, it is necessary to retain the original
   terms.

   The Canon is the most elaborate form into which the praise of the
   Church is cast. A canon consists nominally of nine odes, for the reason
   that there are nine scriptural canticles employed at Lauds, viz.--(1)
   The Song of Moses after crossing the Red Sea; (2) The Song of Moses in
   Deut. xxxii.; The Songs of (3) Hannah; (4) Habakkuk; (5) Isaiah; (6)
   Jonah; (7) The Three Children, first part, and (8) second part; (9)
   Mary (the Magnificat), Simeon (Nunc dimittis). But the second ode is
   generally omitted from the canon on account of the denunciations of God
   against Israel which it contains, and the canons of the great fast are
   made up of those rejected odes. As reference is made in each ode to the
   canticle of the same number--e.g., in the sixth ode to Jonah's prayer
   in the whale's belly, a considerable amount of ingenuity has been
   expended to secure that reference. The effect in many cases is somewhat
   grotesque, but it is remarkable with what skill it has, in so many
   cases, been accomplished. The result has been to multiply types to an
   extraordinary extent.

   The Hirmos is the first stanza of the ode. It may, or may not, have a
   connection with the stanzas following, but its function is to give them
   their rhythmical model.

   The Troparion.--Troparia are the stanzas which follow the hirmos. There
   are usually three in a Greek ode, but the number may exceed that. The
   term is no doubt derived from the verb trepo, to turn. The troparia
   turn to the strophes of the hirmos as to a model.

   Scattered over the canon is a variety of verses variously named. The
   Kathisma occurs after the third or sixth ode of the canon. The term is
   applied to the verse for the reason that it may be sung during a pause
   in the service, as the word (kathizo) from which the term is derived
   would indicate.

   The Kontakion occurs after the sixth ode. The term may be traced to
   canticum, or more likely kontos short, but it is of very doubtful
   derivation.

   The Hypacöe, another obscure term, occurs after the third ode.

   The Icos follows the kontakion after the sixth ode.

   Each ode is followed by a Theotokion (theotokos), God-bearing. This is
   a troparion dedicated to the Virgin Mother. In some cases a stanza
   depicting her at the Cross follows, called Staurotheotokion.

   Stichera are a series of verses, in some cases taken from the Psalter.

   Idiomelon.--Unlike the troparion, which follows the model set by the
   hirmos, the idiomelon has no model. Stichera Idiomela are a collection
   of irregular verses.

   Kontakion Automelon, is a hymn modelled on any of the set forms.

   Exaposteilarion is a verse sung between certain psalms. It may have
   taken the place of a more ancient form of verse in which God is prayed
   to send forth His light (Lucerns), or the term may indicate the rule
   that the exaposteilarion is sung by one of the clergy who is sent
   (exaposteilon), from his place among the choir, down to the middle of
   the church, for that purpose.

   Apolutikion, is the prayer preceding the close of the office.

   One prime characteristic of Greek hymnody should be referred to. Unlike
   our English hymn which is intensely subjective--in many cases
   unhealthily so, the Greek hymn is in most cases objective. God, in the
   glory of His majesty, and clothed with His attributes, is held up to
   the worship and adoration of His people. Christ in His person and work
   is set before the mind in a most realistic manner. His birth and its
   accompaniments; His life; the words He spoke and the works He did; His
   passion in all the agony of its detail; the denial of Peter; the
   remorse of Judas; the Crucifixion; the darkness, the terror, the opened
   graves; the penitent thief, the loud cry, the death;--all are depicted
   in plain unmistakeable language. So we have in the hymns of the Greek
   Church a pictorial representation of the history of Redemption which,
   by engaging the mind, appeals ultimately to the heart and its emotions.
   Our self-regarding praise is perhaps inevitable, as being the product
   of the meditative spirit which has its birth and lives in the land of
   the twilight; but the advantages of the objectiveness of Greek hymnody
   are so patent, that its cultivation might be fostered by our hymn
   writers, with advantage to the devotional feeling of our people, and to
   the worship of the Church.

   For messengers of death are spurned;

   The fall of Adam Thou hast raised,

   And Satan's power is overturned.


   III

   We, all unworthy, stand around

   Thy life inspiring grave, and raise

   To Thy great tenderness of heart,

   O Christ our Lord, a hymn of praise;

   For thou gav'st welcome to the Cross,

   Nor thrust the hand of death away,

   That thou, O Lover of our race,

   Mightst give the Resurrection day.


   IV

   Word with the Father in the past,

   Word with the Father aye to reign;

   Mysterious born, to live and die,

   And in His glory rise again.

   O God of life to thee we sing,

   Saviour of our souls, to Thee

   Let hymns from every heart arise,

   And everlasting glory be.

   I

   Now the Lord from earth ascending,

   Seeks the throne of heaven again,

   That the Comforter, descending,

   Might abide with sinful men.


   II

   Clouds His chariots, upwards rising

   Bear Him proudly to the skies;

   Heaven beholds a sight surprising,

   Man above the angels rise.


   III

   Lift your gates ye powers supernal;

   All ye nations come adore;

   For the Christ to realms eternal,

   Goes to dwell forevermore.

   8.7.8.7


   I

   As angel hosts with heavenly songs,

   Before Thy throne adore Thee,

   So would we Lord, in humbler strains,

   Pour out our hearts before Thee.


   II

   Forever blessed be Thy name,

   Thrice Holy, we revere Thee;--

   Shew mercy as Thy people now,

   In fear and hope draw near Thee.


   III

   Thou from eternal ages, God,

   The Heaven of heavens containing;

   Thou Christ our Lord, Thou Spirit good,

   In Trinity remaining.


   IV

   Daring like cherubim on high,

   Who praising stand around Thee,

   We bring the tribute of our hearts,

   And with our praise surround Thee.

   Our hearts to Heaven upraising,

   We, with the angelic host,

   Sing praises to the Father,

   To Son, and Holy Ghost.


   II

   O Uncreated Nature,

   Yet Maker Thou of all,

   Our lips proclaim Thy praises,

   All Holy, Holy, Holy,

   Eternal God art Thou,--

   Hear us in prayer before Thee,

   And send Thy mercy now.

   In slumber Thou hast kept us,

   And now, with morning light,

   Our hearts and minds awaken,

   And give them morn for night.


   V

   And we shall give Thee praises

   Blest Trinity adored;

   For Holy, Holy, Holy,

   The hour when prayer is made,

   And fervently we cry to Thee

   O Undivided Trinity;--

   Holy, Holy, Holy Thou,

   God of Hosts to Whom we bow.


   II

   Even as the Heavenly hosts,--

   But with unworthy lips,--

   Eternal Trinity most strong,

   To Thee we raise victorious song,

   And falling down before Thee now,

   Sing Holy, Holy, Holy Thou.


   III

   Thou Who wast born on earth,

   But still with God remained,

   Accept us Christ our God we pray,

   As with angelic hosts we say,

   Holy, Holy, Holy Thou,

   With Thy mercy bless us now.

   Without the smart of woe?

   What glory lingers fadeless

   II

   All is a fleeting shadow,

   And all a fitful gleam,

   Come friends behold me here,

   Speechless and breathless lying;

   Come with your tears and sighing.


   II

   But yesterday I lived,

   And walked, and spoke with you:

   Come friends, with the last kiss.

   Bid me a long adieu.


   III

   For I shall walk no more

   The wonted paths we trod;

   My voice is stilled, I go

   To speak alone with God.

   The Judge has called me hence,--

   To Whom the wise and great,

   The warrior and the king,

   Are men of one estate.

   Shall final doom recall;

   The life of each lies bare,

   Before the Judge of all.

   For all the good I've done,

   For all the ill and blame,--

   Shall come to me in full,

   That by His saving might,

   I may a dwelling find

   Among the sons of light.

   There love the soul entwines,

   And whispers fan its fragrant flowers.

   Here would I humbly fall,

   Before my God adoring,

   That He may heed the call,

   I bring to Him imploring;

   And open wide the gate,

   Closed by the hand of sin,

   That, with the saints, thus late,

   I yet may enter in;

   And taste the tree of life that grows,

   To heal the smart of mortal woes.

VAIN THE BLISS FROM EARTH THAT SPRINGS

   (From the Burial Office for a Layman)

   alethos mataiotes ta sumpanta
   Euchologion, p. 409

   tr., John Brownlie

   7.7.7.7


   I

   Vain the bliss from earth that springs,--

   Life is but an empty shade;

   All our toil its bounty brings,

   Made of what our dreams are made.


   II

   When with toil the mountain's height

   Lies beneath our weary feet;

   When the goal we kept in sight,

   Yields the victory to the fleet;--


   III

   Fades the landscape from our view,

   Droops the laurel on our brow,

   False the things we thought were true,

   Gone the joys that lured us, now.


   IV

   Ah! the world we gain to lose,

   Ends our triumph with the grave;

   All earth's wealth and power refuse

   What vain hope exulting gave.


   V

   Christ, Thou Lover of our race,

   When the strife of earth is o'er,

   Give our weary souls a place,

   In Thy Kingdom evermore.

HAIL! THE MORN WITH GLADNESS CROWNED

   tr., John Brownlie

   7.8.7.8


   I

   Hail! the morn with gladness crowned,

   Morn of morns, O glad and glorious!

   When the Lord of Life, renowned,

   Brake the bands of death, victorious.


   II

   Hades gazed in dread surprise,

   As the light the darkness sundered;

   Prisoners raised their weary eyes

   Lit with hope, and mutely wondered.


   III

   Wounded was the Victor's brow,

   Where the angry thorns distressed it;

   But the conqueror's laurel now

   Winding, on His forehead rested.


   IV

   Hail! the Man from death arisen.

   Hail! the Christ a Victor glorious.

   Thou hast broken hades' prison,

   Christ, the Son of God, victorious.

CLOSE BESIDE THE HEART THAT LOVES ME

   tr., John Brownlie

   8.7.8.7


   I

   Close beside the heart that loves me

   Would I rest in sorrow's hour,

   With a Father's smile above me,

   And beneath an arm of power.


   II

   Weak and worthless, worn and weary,

   Welcome bids my faith be strong;

   Sorrow's hour is short if dreary,

   Joy shall last through ages long.


   III

   Dark the hour, but comes the morrow,

   Dawn shall waken by and by;

   Light shall gild the clouds of sorrow,

   When the sun is in the sky.


   IV

   Rest, my soul, that love unfailing

   Strengthens in the hour of woe,--

   For the pain thy life assailing

   Found Him when he dwelt below.


   V

   'Tis a heart that knows the sorrow,

   Trust it when the night comes down;--

   Tears shall yield to song to-morrow,

   Night to morn, and cross to crown.

THE TIME SHALL SURELY COME

   tr., John Brownlie

   6.6.8.6


   I

   The time shall surely come,

   The hour is drawing near,

   When in the clouds of heaven the Lord

   To mortals shall appear.


   II

   Not in a lowly garb,

   Shall we the Lord descry,

   But decked in glory like the sun,

   That lights the morning sky.


   III

   Not as in former days,

   To pain and suffering sore,--

   He comes to judge, Who came to save,--

   To reign for evermore.


   IV

   Then, O my soul, awake!

   Put on thy garb of light,

   Look for the dawn that brings the day,

   All glorious and bright.


   V

   Wait, for the hour is nigh;

   Watch, for His coming nears;

   Be thou the faithful servant then,

   When He, thy Lord, appears.

THE TRANSFIGURATION

   tr., John Brownlie

   8.8.8.8


   I

   When glory crowned the mountain top,

   And Christ was decked in garments fair,

   The prophets of the Lord appeared,

   And talked with the Redeemer there.


   II

   "Let us make this our dwelling-place,"

   'Twas thus his followers made request;

   "For it is good to linger here,

   And they who dwell with Thee are blest."


   III

   Then from a cloud a voice was heard,

   While each in terror held his breath,--

   "This is My Own beloved Son,

   Hear ye what the Belovéd saith."


   IV

   Jesus, when Thy glory gilds

   The mount of God whereon we meet,

   May we the voice from Heaven discern,

   And bow expectant at Thy feet.

BEYOND THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN

   tr., John Brownlie

   6.6.8.6


   I

   Beyond the clouds of Heaven,

   The Lord of life ascends;

   Behold Him rise towards the skies,

   Who for our race was given.


   II

   He came to earth Whose grace

   Hath made our vileness clean;

   That we may rise towards the skies,

   And serve before His face.


   III

   He dwelt on earth Who gave

   Himself for sinful man,--

   That we may rise towards the skies,

   Whom he came down to save.


   IV

   We would no longer gaze,

   O Christ, to where Thou art,--

   But, that we rise, towards the skies,

   Do Thou Thy servants raise.

TRIPLE BEAM OF GLORY

   tr., John Brownlie

   6.5.6.5 D


   I

   Triple Beam of glory,

   Through the darkness poured;

   One the Light eternal

   In our blessed Lord:

   Give us in the morning,

   Gladness for the day,--

   All our life adorning,

   Chase the night away.


   II

   Glory of the Father,

   Glory of the Son,

   Glory of the Spirit,

   Blessed Three in One:

   Let Thy beams united--

   Brighter than the sun,

   Lighten men benighted--

   Blessed Three in One.


   III

   Men in darkness sitting

   Scan the eastern skies,--

   Glory of the Father,

   On their night arise.

   Give the morn supernal,

   Give the endless day;--

   Light of light eternal,

   Banish night away.


   IV

   Hearts are dark with sorrow,

   Minds are dull with care,

   Clouds of doubt envelop

   Mankind everywhere.

   Triple Beam of gladness,

   Through the ages poured,

   Give us joy for sadness,--

   Shine upon us, Lord.

O GOD OF LIGHT AND LIFE AND JOY

   tr., John Brownlie

   8.8.6.8.8.6


   I

   O God of Light and Life and Joy,

   Blest Trinity! my soul employ

   While I have power to sing:

   No song too glad to raise to Thee,

   Eternal, glorious Trinity,--

   No gift too rich to bring.


   II

   When darkness brooded o'er the earth,

   At thy command light had its birth,

   And night and darkness fled;

   And still, where hearts are bound in night,

   Thou speak'st the word, "Let there be light,"

   And noontide beams are shed.


   III

   Death held the Christ of God enchained,

   The grave the Lord of Life restrained,

   And eyes were filled with tears;--

   Awoke the morn in eastern skies!

   Behold, the Lord of Life arise!

   Farewell to mortal fears!


   IV

   O joyless still the spirit sighs,

   And fearful looks to ebon skies,

   And stars begin to shine;--

   Lo! overhead the bright array,

   The night is shining as the day,

   When hopes and fears entwine.


   V

   O God of Light and Life and Joy,

   Blest Trinity, my soul employ

   While I have power to sing:

   No song too glad to raise to Thee,

   Eternal, glorious Trinity,

   No gift too rich to bring.

THE MORN IN BEAUTY BREAKS

   tr., John Brownlie

   6.6.6.6.6.6


   I

   The morn in beauty breaks,

   The world to life awakes,

   Up, soul of mine and sing;

   And let the day begun,

   In hours of service run,

   And joy to duty bring.


   II

   The darkness fades away,

   Light ushers in the day,--

   Let there be light for me!

   That round my path no cloud

   Dark folding may enshroud,

   Me in perplexity.


   III

   To Father and to Son,

   To Spirit, Three in One,

   Eternal praise be given:

   Sung by the saints above,

   In songs of fervent love,

   Up in the choirs of heaven.

SEE WHERE THE ORB OF DAY

   tr., John Brownlie

   6.6.8.6.6.6


   I

   See where the orb of day

   In glory sinks to rest,

   The clouds of gold and purple crown

   The mountains of the west;

   And eve in silence brings

   The night on dusky wings.


   II

   It is the hour of peace,

   And hearts to heaven ascend,--

   Come with your burdens and your care,

   To an unchanging Friend;

   And let the passing day,

   Bear all your fears away.


   III

   It is the hour of prayer;

   Let every fault be known;

   Unveil the secrets of the soul,

   And every sin disown;

   The blood for sinners spilt,

   Shall bear away your guilt.


   IV

   It is the hour of praise,

   Let joy the stillness break;

   And every grateful thought of God

   To living song awake;

   And saints in heaven shall bear

   To God your fervent prayer.


   V

   The night in silence falls,--

   O God to Thee be praise!

   And to the Spirit and the Son,

   Throughout the endless days;--

   Eternal Three in One,

   While endless ages run.
