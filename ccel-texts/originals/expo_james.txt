   IT is with great pleasure that the translator offers to the Christian
   public, the second number of Neander's Practical Expositions, believing
   that it will be found no less interesting than the preceding volume on
   the Epistle to the Philippians. It is characterized by the same
   masterly power of development, the same depth and fulness of Christian
   experience. Seed-thoughts crowd every page; and many single passages,
   in sublimity of moral sentiment and beauty of illustration, equal
   anything which Neander has written. As being more strictly practical in
   its character, and elucidating a portion of the Divine word less
   understood, it may be even more generally acceptable and useful than
   the former Exposition. It restores to us, so to speak, one of the lost
   treasures of the church; for no part of the New Testament has been more
   misunderstood and perverted, or suffered more general neglect, than
   this Epistle. Luther rejected it without ceremony, calling it "an
   epistle of straw;" and many more timid minds have been greatly
   perplexed by its apparent contrariety to the doctrines of grace. The
   discussion of its character and claims, hitherto confined to scholars,
   is here presented in a form intelligible and practically useful to
   common Christians.

   By the light of Neander's comprehensive mind, we see in James not the
   opponent of Paul, or of the great doctrine of justification by faith
   alone; but the earnest expounder of that "Law of Liberty," of which
   justification by faith is the chief corner-stone. Paul develops the
   principle; James depicts its results in the life. Paul unfolds the
   great love of God towards us; James points out the tests, whether this
   love has been received into our hearts and become there the vitalizing,
   reigning principle. It is the tree known by its fruit, the enkindled
   light by the light which it imparts, the life within by the outward
   signs of life. In the personality of James, and the character of the
   churches whom he addressed, we find the true key to this Epistle.
   Placed side by side with the Sermon on the Mount, it is seen to be a
   faithful reflection of that divine original; its whole essence and
   intent being comprised in those words of our Saviour, which we have
   prefixed to this volume as its most appropriate motto: "Why call ye me
   Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say!"

   One opinion advanced in the author's introductory remarks, viz., that
   James was not an Apostle, may not gain the assent of all his readers.
   Neander himself formerly held, [1] with many other distinguished
   critics, that this epistle was written by the Apostle James, the son of
   Alpheus and of Mary the sister of our Lord's mother; who, as being the
   near kinsman of the Lord, was in accordance with Jewish usage called
   his brother. The writer may be permitted to suggest that the practical
   inferences, here so skilfully traced, might be drawn, though not indeed
   with equal force, from the author's earlier view. James, as the Lord's
   own brother, or as a near kinsman, must in either case have been
   subject to very similar influences, arising from near earthly
   relationship to Christ. In the exposition itself, there is nothing at
   variance with either supposition. Nor does either view affect what
   Neander so truthfully says of the relations of the mother of Jesus, and
   of the contrast between the earthly and the spiritual; since there
   were, as we have every reason to believe, "brothers of the Lord" in the
   strictest sense.

   To facilitate the use of the translation, the first part has been
   divided into sections with a brief statement of the contents of each,
   for which the translator is responsible. The quotations from the
   Epistle are given in the words of the English version, with the
   author's variations in brackets wherever they are made the basis of his
   view.

   The third and last number of this series, the Exposition of the First
   Epistle of John, was prepared for the press by the author, and has been
   given to the public since his decease. A translation of it will follow
   as soon as practicable.

INTRODUCTION.
     __________________________________________________________________

   ยง 1. Diversities in modes of religious development, and in the
   consequent forms of faith.

   IT is the remark of one of the early Church Fathers, that what Paul
   says of himself,--viz. that he became all things to all men, that he
   might win all to the Gospel,--is true in a still higher degree of Him
   who was in this the Apostle's pattern, of Christ himself. We see it in
   that manifold variety of manner, adapted to all the varieties in human
   character and relations, by which, both in his personal labors on
   earth, and in his spiritual revelations among all nations since his
   ascension, he has drawn men to a saving knowledge of himself. His
   manner, while laboring upon earth, is indeed an image of that invisible
   divine agency extending through all times, in which he evermore reveals
   himself as the same yesterday, to-day, and forever. This diversity
   Christ himself indicates, in those parables in which he describes how
   the kingdom. of God is found; showing at the same time the one thing,
   in which all must finally agree who would become partakers of the
   kingdom of God, and the varieties of way and manner in which they are
   conducted thither. Only those attain. to the kingdom of God who enter
   it by violence. Only those find the treasure hidden in the field, who
   are ready to sell all they have that they may become possessors of that
   field. Only those secure possession of that precious pearl, outshining
   in beauty and splendor all beside, who prize it above all else, and
   shun no pains, no cost to win it for themselves,--esteeming all other
   good as nothing, for the sake of that one highest good, the kingdom of
   God.

   But in order to bring men to this decision of purpose, without which
   none can enter the kingdom of God, they must be acted on in various
   ways suited to their various characters and circumstances. Some are
   like the merchant, who having spared no pains or cost to find precious
   pearls, at length, through this earnest and laborious search, secures
   possession of that richest of all jewels. Such are those, who, impelled
   by longing after some satisfying good, already have sought it long in
   vain. They have found many things which satisfy in part; but in the end
   have learned, that of all these not one can give the spirit full and
   lasting satisfaction. Thus they are ever beginning the search anew,
   till at length, through this ever-renewed effort they attain to that
   one highest good, and find in it the full satisfaction which their
   souls require. Others again, seeking no treasure, come unawares upon
   the field containing it, and find it as it were by accident. Such are
   those, in whom the longing after the highest good, the kingdom of God,
   has not yet been awakened; who are surprised by an unsought gift, which
   imparts to their souls a satisfaction never imagined and never sought.
   The one class, by a gradual progressive development out of a life, in
   which preparative grace had from the first given tokens of its active
   presence, quickening and unfolding by various means the life-germ in
   the higher nature,--had thus been finally drawn into full fellowship
   with the Lord. The other, willing slaves of passions that long
   withstood the divine call, had been drawn at length, as by a power that
   constrained their resisting will, to him whose love seeks the
   deliverance of all.

   Since now the mode of development is so different in the two cases, so
   also will be the form which faith assumes in each. To the one, the new
   state to which he has attained will seem but as the aim and completion
   of that earlier one, which by many progressive steps conducted to and
   ended in it; and that earlier form of life, out of which he passed into
   this new state, will always remain to him a dear and familiar one. To
   the view of the other, the new state will present itself as in direct
   opposition to the old. These two forms of conception are both founded
   in truth; each will, in its peculiar manner, contribute to the glory
   and furtherance of Christianity. The first is especially adapted to
   show, how all that preceded this new state was designed to prepare the
   way for it; and here the change will manifest itself in a less striking
   form. The second is certainly the more thorough and
   profound,--presenting a more complete development of the new life in
   its essential nature, in which it is exalted above all else.

   This diversity and variety, observable in the whole process of
   development through which Christianity has passed, in the entire
   history of the Church, appears also in the earliest stage of that
   process belonging to the apostolic age. But in its later history, we
   often find these differences,--which, as already indicated, should be
   mutually supplemental, serving each to complete the other,--separating
   the one from the other, and assuming the attitude of irreconcilable
   antagonism. The perception of the higher unity is wanting; although he
   who can recognize the One Christ in all his manifestations, partial as
   they may be and obscured by human narrowness of view, will be able even
   from this antagonism to deduce that higher unity. From this source have
   sprung those controversies, which have done so much to destroy rather
   than to edify. On the contrary, the relation of the great Teachers of
   the New Testament to one another, as exhibited to us in their lives and
   writings, enables us to view these manifold forms of conception as
   mutually completive; not excluding one another, but belonging together
   as parts of the same whole,--the One Christ in the broken rays of his
   manifold revelation through various organs.

   It is in this light we are to regard James, the brother of the Lord, as
   forming the counterpart to the great Apostle of the Gentiles. That we
   may be able rightly to understand and apply his Epistle, according to
   the plan adopted in our explanation of Paul's Epistle to the
   Philippians, we must first endeavor to form a distinct idea of his
   whole personality, as exhibited in the circumstances of his personal
   development and in his labors, as well as in this Epistle.
     __________________________________________________________________

   ยง 2. Personal relations and religious development of James.

   In reference to the personality of James, the fact is an important one
   that he did not belong to the number of the Apostles. The Apostles were
   formed out of those disciples, who had attached themselves to the
   Redeemer with minds still undeveloped, and yielding with childlike
   susceptibility wholly to his influence. They had not been previously
   formed in another school, before coming into connection with him. Their
   whole development they had received in intercourse with him; and hence
   they were fitted, in a peculiar manner, to become vessels of his
   all-transforming grace, to receive in themselves a faithful impress of
   his image, and to serve as instruments for the diffusion of his word
   and his spirit through all ages. With Paul it was far otherwise. He
   had, indeed, this in common with the rest of the Apostles, viz. that he
   could bear testimony as an eye-witness to the Risen Christ, and had
   received an immediate, personal impression of him. But he had come to
   Christ, with a well-defined system formed in a wholly different school;
   and hence, in his case, the new man in Christ must present in its
   development the strongest possible contrast with his earlier character.

   Unlike to both of these cases was that of James. He was a brother of
   the Lord according to the flesh. All those passages of the Gospels in
   which "brothers of the Lord" are mentioned, together with Matt. i. 25,
   are most naturally explained on the supposition, that after the birth
   of Jesus Mary bore still other sons. These were the "brothers of the
   Lord," of whom James was one. Inasmuch as marriage and the production
   of offspring, like everything belonging to our nature, was to be
   sanctified through Christ, there is nothing in such a supposition which
   is at all questionable, nothing derogatory to the dignity of the mother
   of Christ, or to his own. If anything offensive is found in it, it is
   owing solely to a mistaken veneration of Mary, and to that false
   ascetic tendency, whose views of the unholiness of the married state,
   and of the superiority of celibacy, are entirely at variance with the
   spirit of Christianity. On the contrary, it is only when thus seen in
   contrast with the usual course of nature, that the birth of Jesus, as
   effected by supernatural agency, appears in its true light and its true
   significance. Christ, as the miraculously begotten son of Mary, then
   appears in contrast with the offspring of Mary according to the laws of
   natural descent; the contrast between the natural and the supernatural
   (as Paul designates it, Gal. iv. 23 and 29), between him that is born
   after the spirit and him that is born after the flesh; the contrast
   which pervades the whole process of development in the kingdom of God.

   James was therefore, in his religious development, distinguished from
   the other preachers of the Gospel, in that it neither proceeded so
   entirely and from its first beginnings from Christ himself as was the
   case with the other Apostles,--nor formed itself out of such a contrast
   between the earlier and the later, as appears in the case of Paul. His
   path of development, originating elsewhere, moved on for a time
   independently beside that circle of influences, which had formed itself
   from and around Christ, and not till a later period became wholly
   united with it.

   Now it might seem, indeed, that one so closely connected with the Lord
   as his own brother, the daily witness of his life and actions, was the
   one fitted above all others to become his disciple; that one so
   pre-eminently favored from the first, must have been in many respects
   in advance of the Apostles themselves. On this view was founded the
   judgment of the common Jewish Christians, that they were bound to exalt
   James above all other preachers of the Gospel, and to pay special
   respect to his authority.

   In the estimation thus formed of him, by the standard of the merely
   external natural relation to Christ, we perceive the intermingling of
   the Jewish spirit in the conception of Christianity,--its opposite
   constituting the true Christian stand-point; as, in general, the
   disposition to the outward and formal in religious things is Jewish,
   while the tendency to the inward and spiritual belongs to the nature of
   Christianity. The internal and external stand not seldom in inverse
   proportion to each other. He who stood in the nearest external
   relations to the revelation of the kingdom of God, to the manifestation
   of the divine in humanity, to the appearance of the Son of God,--might
   inwardly be farthest from it, and so remain if he stopped at the
   external manifestation, if he accustomed himself to see only with the
   bodily eye, and through this habit was hindered from penetrating with
   the eye of the spirit to that which was within. This we see in the
   whole relation of the Jews to the kingdom of God, and to the Messiah
   who proceeded from the midst of this people, destined to prepare the
   way for his manifestation. Christ himself testifies, in opposition to
   this outward Jewish tendency, that the external natural relation is of
   no account; that all depends rather on the inward relation, formed by
   the direction of the mind and heart; that not natural relationship, but
   submission of the soul, can alone bring one into union with him. So on
   one occasion, when he was occupied with his life-work, the preaching of
   the Gospel, among those who listened to his words with eager and
   receptive hearts; he repelled those who would interrupt him on the plea
   that his nearest kindred, his mother and brethren, desired to see him.
   Pointing to the circle of disciples, in whom the seed of the divine
   word was received into the good soil of receptive and retentive hearts,
   he said: "My mother and my brethren are THESE, who hear the word of God
   and do it." (Luke viii. 21, Mark iii. 34, 35.) Thus the essential point
   is not, how one is related to him by natural descent, but how he is in
   spirit related to the divine will revealed by him. Here also belongs
   the incident related Luke xi. 27, 28. A woman, powerfully affected by
   the divine impression of his words, cried out from the midst of the
   listening multitude: "Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the
   breasts which thou hast sucked!" "Yea rather," he replied, implying the
   vanity of this supposed advantage, "blessed are they who hear the word
   of God and keep it!" Prophetic warnings! Not only against that
   externalizing tendency, as shown in the admixture of the old Jewish
   spirit with Christianity,--but against that same spirit as it has
   often, in later times and under other forms, reappeared in the
   Christian Church!

   Thus the very thing, which might seem most favorable to the religious
   development of James, turned to his disadvantage. The saying which
   Christ used in reference to his fellow-townsmen among whom the greater
   part of his life had been spent, and who had been eye-witnesses of his
   progressive development from childhood,--"A prophet is of no honor in
   his own country,"--applies with equal force to the case of James and
   his brothers. For the very reason, that they had from the first been
   eye-witnesses of the human earthly development of the Son of Man, they
   were not able to penetrate beyond the outward human veil. It became to
   them a stone of stumbling. True they afterwards witnessed the
   revelation of the Son of God, both in the inward power of the divine
   life perceptible only to the inwardly awakened sense for the divine,
   and in those proofs of power exhibited in his miracles. Still the
   faith, thus at times awakened, gave way continually to that skepticism
   proceeding from the prejudices of the natural man, who judges only
   after the flesh and by the outward appearance; and thus, during the
   whole earthly life of Christ, they remained in this state of
   vacillation, wavering between faith and unbelief. But when that stone
   of stumbling was taken out of their way, and the Son of God no longer
   stood before their eyes in the earthly veil of the Son of Man; when He,
   who was believed dead, showed himself victorious over death and living
   in divine power, to those whose weak faith required such confirmation;
   it was then, that the decisive and final direction was given to the
   development of the religious life of James (1 Cor. xv. 7). From this
   time forward we see in him the decided, unwavering, zealous witness of
   the faith in that Jesus, as his Messiah, Lord and Saviour, who had been
   his own brother according to the flesh. (James i. 1.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   ยง 3. Stand-point of James as an inspired teacher, and his relation to
   Paul.

   The manner, however, in which he testified of Christ, took its
   character from his previous training and course of life. He, above all
   others, stood on the ground of Jewish piety in the Old Testament forms;
   and had already completely developed himself within this sphere, when
   he was led to that decisive faith in Jesus, as the Messiah promised in
   the Old Testament. From this new point of view, his previous Judaism
   unfolded itself in its true and full import. Christianity now appears
   to him as the true Judaism. The spirit which proceeds from Christ
   explains the forms of the Old Testament, and leads them to their proper
   fulfilment. The position of James is precisely that taken by Christ in
   the Sermon on the Mount; which contains the germ of all that is
   peculiar to the Gospel, without expressly declaring the abrogation of
   the Law; where all is presented under the idea of the kingdom of God,
   and the reference of each particular to the person of Christ, though
   everywhere implied and forming the central point of all, is nowhere
   asserted in words. Hence in the development of the divine
   kingdom,--where as in all the works of God, the works of grace as well
   as of nature, no chasms are allowed but all proceeds by progressive
   steps,--James forms a very important transition-point from the Old to
   the New Testament. Something would be wanting to us, if we had not
   James in the New Testament. And that narrowness of view, which disdains
   to follow patiently this gradual development,--demanding everywhere and
   at once the perfected form,--may find its punishment in the consequent
   incompleteness of its own Christian knowledge. As a means of leading
   pious Jews to faith in the Gospel, this position of James was of
   special use. Just in proportion as it would have been detrimental to a
   Paul, whose mission was the conversion of the heathen nations, was it
   advantageous to James in the sphere of labor assigned to him in
   Palestine, and particularly in Jerusalem among unmixed Jews. Thus
   divine wisdom manifests itself in assigning to each his sphere, his
   peculiar mission in the development of the kingdom of God, adapted to
   his peculiar qualifications. The sole concern is that each rightly
   fulfil his appointed mission, understand and faithfully adhere to his
   prescribed limits; while at the same time he recognizes the divine call
   in him also, to whom as the possessor of other gifts another sphere of
   labor has been assigned,--and is willing to regard their several
   spheres as each the complement of the other. Such was the relation of
   James to Paul.

   James did indeed know, from the first, what the voice of prophecy had
   indicated, of the coming extension of Jehovah's worship among the
   heathen nations, and of their participation in the blessings of the
   divine kingdom,--a glory which belonged to Messianic times,--and also
   that this was to be fulfilled through Christ as the Messiah. But the
   possibility of a worship of Jehovah except in the old legal forms, or
   of a participation in the kingdom. of God in any other way, remained
   hidden from him at first, even after he had attained to a settled faith
   in Jesus as the Messiah. The intimations in the discourses of Christ
   that his word should become the leaven, which, by an indwelling power
   alone and independently of all else, should penetrate the life of
   humanity; in Jews and Gentiles alike leavening all and forming it anew;
   that the new spirit of Christianity should burst asunder and break
   through the forms of legal Judaism; these intimations he did not yet
   understand. This belonged to those things of which Christ said, in his
   parting words to his disciples, that what they could not yet comprehend
   should afterwards be revealed to them by the Holy Spirit. But this
   revelation of the Holy Spirit was not imparted to all at the same time,
   nor in the same way. This too was determined by the different
   stand-points from which they had attained to faith in the Gospel.
   Accordingly, more or less of preparation might be required for leading
   them to that more perfect knowledge; it might be effected more by a
   process of thought inspired and guided by the Holy Spirit, and thus
   enabled to develop and apprehend the whole sum of revealed truth,--or
   it might be more the effect of immediate illumination by the Divine
   Spirit. In the history of the church, we meet with many melancholy
   examples of opposition and estrangement, when the spiritual insight
   attained by one is still withheld from another, and the one thus
   becomes free from the narrow limits in which the other is still
   confined. Even in the apostolic church, this was the source of much
   disunion and division.

   But James was far from that narrow obstinacy of temper, which would not
   allow any stand-point but his own; would permit no opposing facts to
   influence his convictions,--promptly rejecting the truth revealed to
   others because it was not imparted through him, and thus setting bounds
   to the farther development of the kingdom of God. When, at the
   apostolic conference (Acts xv.), the controverted point respecting the
   observance of the Mosaic law was for the first time discussed, and
   Peter and Paul bore testimony to the effects of the Gospel among
   believing Gentiles, who had not submitted to circumcision, nor in any
   other respect to the observance of the Law; these undeniable facts were
   proof enough for James, that through faith in the Saviour, the same
   divine results were produced among the heathen as among believing Jews.
   In this he saw a fulfilment of the Old Testament predictions; and he
   now learned their true aim and import, as he had never understood it
   before. The mild conciliating spirit of James is shown, by the manner
   in which he sought to reconcile the differences between the Jewish and
   Gentile Christians. He could do justice to a stand-point wholly
   different from his own. Believing Gentiles, on the ground of their
   faith merely, were to be admitted to equality with; believing Jews in
   the fellowship of the divine kingdom; only, for the furtherance of
   harmony with believers from among the Jews, they were to conform in
   certain external points, which might also serve to withhold them from
   participation in everything connected with heathen worship. But while
   James recognized the equality of churches consisting of uncircumcised
   Gentiles, and allowed to the preaching of the Gospel among the Gentiles
   its own rights as an independent calling; at the same time remained
   true to his own peculiar stand-point, point, according to which the old
   forms were to be continued as depositories of the new spirit, and the
   Jews were to retain their religious nationality unchanged. Still, as we
   see from the Acts of the Apostles, he was ever the mediator between
   Paul and the zealots among the Jewish Christians, who were prejudiced
   against him. Here too he always conducted in the same spirit of
   mildness and conciliation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   ยง 4. Character and condition of the Churches to whom the Epistle was
   addressed, and nature of the errors against which it was directed.

   In order now to understand and rightly apply the Epistle of James, we
   must endeavor to form a distinct conception of those to whom it was
   addressed, and whose peculiar circumstances he had especially in view.

   We can, indeed, say nothing definite in regard to the region where
   these churches are to be sought. The Epistle itself furnishes only
   general information, sufficient, however, for the practical purposes we
   have now in view. The essential points are these: There were churches
   consisting exclusively of Christians of Jewish origin, in which all the
   practical errors of Judaism were associated with faith in Jesus as the
   Messiah; and in which there were many, who gave little or no evidence
   of the new creation which is the necessary product of that faith.

   That wholly earthly direction of mind, which was often connected with
   false zeal for the honor of God; the insatiable love of gain, and
   consequent divisions from the clashing of selfish interests; these were
   the faults which they had brought with them from their earlier Jewish
   state, into their new Christian relation. The aristocracy of wealth
   held in check the pervading spirit of Christian love, whose office it
   is to repress and triumph over all earthly distinctions. Instead of
   being obliterated by that spirit of love, the distinctions caused by
   the unequal distribution of wealth, were recognized and maintained at
   the expense of that fraternal relation, which should characterize a
   community of Christians. Furthermore, it belonged to the defects of
   this false Jewish spirit, that, instead of regarding piety as a whole,
   proceeding from the inward temper of the heart and embracing the entire
   life; it held only to particular observances of the outward life, in
   which piety should manifest itself,--that tendency to the external in
   religion of which we have spoken. This manifested itself in the great
   value attached to external descent from the theocratic people, to
   circumcision and the works of the Law, making justification dependent
   thereon. This same spirit now passed over to the Jewish Christians; and
   became especially prominent, wherever they had the ascendency in
   opposition to Gentiles and Gentile Christians.

   This tendency was one which, from its very nature, belongs exclusively
   to no age; it was no mere thing of the past, extinguished with Judaism
   once for all, and never to reappear in the Christian church. The
   declaration of the preacher of wisdom is applicable here,--that "what
   has been will be, and there is nothing new under the sun." What we here
   term the Jewish spirit, had not its origin in anything inherent in
   Judaism as a divine institution; but is to be referred rather to the
   nature of the unrenewed man, drawing down the divine to his own level,
   and seeking to appropriate it to himself without renouncing his own
   peculiar nature. Now as the nature of the unrenewed man remains ever
   the same, there must at all times proceed from it this same erroneous
   tendency, which we may characterize as in its spirit and nature Jewish.
   This Jewish spirit shows itself equally, when the unrenewed nature of
   man mingles its disturbing influence with the conception of
   Christianity. It is seen in the disposition to value one's self on the
   ground of descent from a Christian people, or from some particular
   nation distinguished in earlier times for its piety, and on this
   account assigned a more conspicuous place in the history of God's
   kingdom; without considering that if his own life does not correspond
   to the peculiar character and position of such a people, this
   connection, instead of being his glory, will become his condemnation.
   So is it also with pretensions based on a father's pious deeds, without
   any effort to imitate his example. So is it when connection with a
   particular church is made one's only boast, his sole ground of hope,
   and no importance is attached to the practice of genuine Christianity;
   when, in short, in the outward organization of the church, the essence
   of Christianity itself is forgotten. In each and all of these cases, we
   perceive the same practical error of the Jewish spirit. So if we base
   our confidence on a zealous devotion to the external observances of
   Christian worship, attendance upon divine service, the celebration of
   the sacraments, without going beyond the outward form; this is in
   spirit precisely the same, as that Jewish reliance upon circumcision
   and the works of the Law. The name alone is changed; the thing itself
   remains the same. Hence all the arguments and warnings against such a
   tendency, which we find in Paul's Epistles, may be applied with equal
   propriety to these same practical errors in every age of the church,
   although the particular forms of it with which he contended may exist
   no longer.

   It does not appear indeed, in the Epistle of James, that he combats
   this tendency in precisely these forms, as is the case in Paul's
   writings. Yet is the root, the essential tendency, the same. He is
   obliged to instruct his readers in the nature of true
   religion,--wherein that form of religion, of which they made so much
   account, must therefore have been deficient. It is only a different
   form of development which is here treated of; the same radical tendency
   is too obvious to be mistaken. There were two leading forms of this
   tendency. One of these consisted in an undue estimation of outward
   works of the Law. The other exalted the mere knowledge of the Law, of
   the true God and of what pertains to his worship, into the principal
   thing; and on the ground of knowledge merely,--of the mere profession
   of belief, of faith simply as an act of the understanding,--claimed
   superiority over the Gentiles, although the course of life by no means
   corresponded to this knowledge and outward profession. Paul likewise
   combats, in the second chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, this false
   reliance on mere knowledge of the Law. Of the same character was that
   dead learning in the Scriptures, such as Christ condemned in the
   Pharisees, who thought that in them they had eternal life, and yet
   would not be directed by them to him who alone could bestow eternal
   life. The consequence was, that each one was anxious to gain currency
   for his own religious views, to set himself up as a teacher for others,
   without first taking care to mould his own character in conformity with
   divine truth. Hence arose the contests between these would-be teachers;
   another form of that bias to the external and the literal, but
   springing from the same root as those before described,--no less
   capable of co-existing with an ungodly life, and of serving as a
   support for it.

   The question now arises,--does the false idea of faith and the
   over-estimation of mere faith, which James opposes in this Epistle,
   belong also to this same radical tendency; or are we to regard it as
   something different, and derived from another source? Do we find here
   so clear a reference to the Pauline idea of faith, as to make the
   conclusion necessary, that the doctrine of justification by faith, as
   taught by Paul, had been misunderstood and misapplied in these
   churches? Some might have imagined, that they could glory in
   justification solely by faith in the Redeemer, while they continued to
   live in the practice of sin. Against such misunderstanding and
   perversion, Paul himself seeks to guard his doctrine, in many passages
   of the Epistle to the Romans. In later times,--when the doctrine which
   Paul made it his especial object to maintain in opposition to Judaism
   and judaizing teachers, had been re-established in its rights by
   Luther, in opposition to a Jewish spirit which had once more crept into
   the church; there then followed a new service of the letter, a new
   phase of this tendency to outward forms, and again the connection
   between faith and life was rent asunder. Much which James says of this
   tendency in his day, might be applied to this case with equal
   propriety.

   This question, whether James is here contending against a
   misapprehension of the Pauline doctrine, or has no reference whatever
   to it,--is by no means necessarily connected with the question of the
   relation of Paul's teaching to that of James. James might have intended
   to oppose a misunderstanding of Paul's doctrine,--nay, even the
   doctrine itself, if he had first met with it in this erroneous form,
   without previous understanding with Paul in regard to his object; and
   yet a perfect harmony might be shown to exist between the two methods
   of exhibiting truth, each serving as the complement of the other. For
   it may easily happen, when one man has formed,--in accordance with his
   peculiar course of training, and the bearing of the counter-view which
   is before his mind,--his own peculiar mode of conceiving and stating a
   truth; that the very opposition made to it by another, conceiving the
   same truth from a different point of view, may show their essential
   agreement,--what was intended to counteract serving only to explain and
   complete. Thus a representation of Christian truths, even if called
   forth by opposition to the peculiarly Pauline form of doctrine, might
   have found place as a completing link, in that collection of writings
   containing the original pure revelation of Christian truth. Both these
   forms of conception and teaching might constitute parts of the same
   whole, as being mutually completive, in the one revelation of the Holy
   Spirit through different human organs inspired by him. Their relation
   to each other must therefore be especially considered hereafter. [2]

   Now although it is possible that such a form of externalizing, as the
   one we have mentioned, might attach itself to the Pauline doctrine, and
   though, as we have seen, this was afterwards actually the case; the
   question still remains, whether we are justified in assuming this in
   regard to the particular churches brought to our knowledge in this
   Epistle. It was in churches like these, formed among Jews and
   exclusively of Jewish converts, that a perversion of the Pauline
   doctrine was most unlikely to arise; inasmuch as the Pauline standpoint
   was one with which they had nothing in common. The Pauline view of
   faith presupposes the strongly marked distinction between Law and
   Gospel, a doctrinal position opposed to legal righteousness, to the
   merit of one's own works. Opposition to the Jewish tendency to
   externals was the precise ground on which it planted itself; and where
   that tendency prevailed, a perverted form of this view could as little
   gain admission as the view itself.

   But to resume our question: may not this particular error,--the false
   idea of faith and over-estimation of mere faith,--which James opposes,
   be also traced back to the same radical tendency? Let us only compare
   what precedes and what follows the discussion of this topic in the
   second chapter. It is preceded (chap. i.) by a rebuke of those who
   founded an imaginary claim on the mere hearing of the word, on the mere
   knowledge of it, without holding themselves bound to practise it; to
   which is added the rebuke of a mere fancied and seeming service of God.
   What now is this but that very same spirit of reliance on the external,
   which manifests itself in a mere adherence to certain articles of
   faith,--faith in the one true God, the Messiah,--and on this ground
   alone claims to be righteous, without recognizing the demands of this
   faith upon the life? As knowledge and practice are at war with each
   other, so are faith and life. A merely theoretical faith corresponds
   exactly to a merely theoretical knowledge. The same man, who satisfies
   himself with being able to discourse much of the law without obeying
   it, is also the one who makes a boast of his faith, without holding
   himself bound to the practice of that which faith requires. The same
   man who finds the essence of religion in certain external works, and
   claims to be a true worshiper of God merely on the ground of professing
   the true religion, is the one also who claims to be accounted righteous
   through a faith which produces no works. If we turn now to what follows
   (chap. iii.), we find that James is here rebuking those who were ever
   ready to exalt themselves into teachers of others; but who, by teaching
   what they did not practise, made themselves the more liable to
   condemnation. What then is this but that same radical tendency over
   again? And on what ground should we be justified in rending the
   intermediate passage from its connection, and making it refer to
   something else, the explanation of which must be sought elsewhere than
   in this one radical tendency?

   It is true, that in the manner of meeting these errors, which we will
   now further consider, James is distinguished in a peculiar way from
   Paul. It is the more practical man in contrast with the more
   systematic; the man to whose wholly Jewish development, faith in Christ
   was superadded as the crown and completion,--in contrast with him,
   whose faith in Christ took the form of direct opposition to his earlier
   Jewish views, as the centre of a wholly new creation. Hence with James,
   opposition to error takes more the form of single propositions and
   exhortations; with Paul it is a connected view, in which all proceeds
   from one central point. With James the reference to Christ appears only
   as one particular among others, a peculiarity especially objected to
   this Epistle, as if Christ were not to be found in it; while with Paul,
   on the contrary, the chief object is to exalt Christ, who is everywhere
   placed foremost, and is everywhere represented as the centre of the
   whole life, from whom all is derived, to whom all is referred. But yet,
   in these single propositions and admonitions of James, we are able to
   trace the higher unity lying at the basis; and can show that all have
   reference to Christ as the living centre, even though he is not
   expressly named. There may be a form of moral development, which
   receives its true light and its true significance through reference to
   Him as its centre and source, although he is not expressly recognized
   by name; and his name may be often on the lips, while yet the whole
   inward character has formed itself without reference to Him. In this
   light we must now endeavor to understand the controversial and
   admonitory passages of this Epistle.

   The churches to whom it was addressed consisted of rich and poor; and
   undoubtedly the latter were the more numerous class among the
   Christians. We know that the Gospel everywhere, and especially among
   the Jews, found freer entrance with the poor and lowly than among the
   rich and powerful. Not that riches in themselves exclude from the
   kingdom of God, or necessarily form a hindrance to faith in the Gospel.
   When Christ says, that it is easier for a camel to go through a
   needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God, he
   means such as he who gave occasion to these words; those to
   whom,--though perhaps unconsciously,--the earthly is the highest good;
   whose treasure being on earth cannot, therefore, be in heaven; whose
   heart belongs to the earth where their treasure is, and is therefore
   far from that direction towards heaven, without which no one can ever
   share in its blessedness. Indeed he himself adds in the same
   connection, that although the salvation of a rich man is impossible
   with men, i. e. by mere human means, yet with God all is possible. He
   would say by this, that divine help is needful, in order that riches
   may not prove a hindrance to the attainment of the kingdom of God. This
   then is the import of the words; not that riches in themselves are a
   hindrance to this object, but that misdirection of the affections into
   which the rich man more than others is liable to fall. The rich should
   be awakened to a consciousness of this, and should be incited by a
   sense of the difficulties inherent in his case, to apply to God for the
   strength which he needs; that even while in possession of all earthly
   riches, he may still keep his treasure in heaven and his heart directed
   thither. In this Epistle itself we learn what is necessary to the rich
   for this purpose. Yet though riches are not, in themselves, a hindrance
   to participation in the kingdom of God, still it was often the case
   among the Jews, that the rich and mighty forgot in worldly enjoyments
   the higher wants of the inner man; lost the fixed consciousness of
   dependence on Him, whose power confers and disposes all; imagining that
   they possessed all things, they had no room left for the feeling of
   want and of the necessity of deliverance from it. Thus too in the Old
   Testament, the rich, the proud, and the ungodly are often ranked
   together as of one class.

   But every external situation may become, according to one's temper of
   mind, either a help or a hindrance to salvation; and nothing can here
   injure or promote his interests independently of his own will. Thus may
   poverty also,--that physical want which depresses the spiritual nature,
   which prevents the inner man from awaking to self-consciousness, and to
   the feeling of his higher spiritual wants,--prove an obstacle to the
   attainment of the kingdom of God. Poverty, too, has its peculiar
   dangers, and this is not overlooked in this Epistle. In general,
   however, it was the poor and lowly, pining under the oppressions of the
   rich and powerful, and under the pressure of physical want, who most
   readily felt the need of deliverance from spiritual want, from inward
   poverty of soul. On this feeling of physical need, could more easily be
   engrafted that consciousness of the soul's necessities, through which
   they might be conducted to the Saviour. As in their case, there was
   nothing to deceive the soul into a seeming satisfaction of its wants,
   they could the more easily be drawn to that which furnished the true
   satisfaction for all its higher necessities. Moreover, the poor in this
   world could more readily than the rich attain to that poverty of
   spirit, to which, as Christ says, belongs the kingdom of Heaven. Thus
   the Gospel found, among the Jews, a readier reception from the poor
   than from the rich; and on this account, Christians were reproachfully
   called The Poor. We do not mean by this, that all these poor who
   received the Gospel, had been led to it by true poverty of spirit, and
   had thus been prepared to receive, as poor and needy, the true riches
   of the Gospel. Among them too was to be found the influence of that
   carnal mind which prevailed among the Jews,--begetting, not the true
   hope of the heavenward directed spirit, but rather the expectation of a
   recompense for bodily privations in the imagined carnal enjoyments of
   the kingdom of Christ. Now the faith of such, if we choose to call it
   by that name, had its source in the carnal mind of the natural man; and
   hence, the earlier form of this natural man was transferred with them
   out of Judaism into a professed Christianity,--where it was, as we
   shall see, opposed and rebuked by James.

   As the poorer and lower class, the Christians had, as we have
   intimated, much to suffer from the persecution and oppression of the
   powerful and rich; partly on account of their religion, partly for the
   promotion of selfish interests, their religion serving as the pretext.
   The rich who called themselves Christians without being so in truth,
   were infected with the common vice of the rich among the Jews, and
   failed in the exercise of love and even justice towards their poorer
   brethren in the faith. Accordingly, we find in this Epistle words of
   consolation and encouragement for the oppressed and suffering, and of
   rebuke for the rich both within and without the church.

EXPOSITION OF THE EPISTLE.

   Ch. i. 2, 3.] ITS opening words are addressed to the
   Suffering,--exhorting them to steadfastness and submission. "My
   brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations." The
   idea of temptation is a comprehensive one in the Scriptures. By it is
   designated, whatever may become an obstacle or impediment to Christian
   faith and Christian virtue,--prosperity and adversity, the world
   without and the world within; everything which, though it may indeed
   occasion the overthrow of faith and virtue in the conflict, thus puts
   them to the test, and may therefore serve also to confirm and
   strengthen them. In this more general sense it might, in itself
   considered, be understood here. But it is evident from the connection
   that here, as in many other passages, are meant the sufferings by which
   the Christian life is tried. Now to those who sigh under sufferings
   such as we have described, he addresses not merely the exhortation, to
   bear them patiently in the prospect of future glory. Far more than
   this. The feeling of suffering should lose itself in joy. They should
   do nothing but rejoice. How could James say this? It was because with
   him all has reference to what is noblest in man, what constitutes his
   true being, the imperishable, the inner man as it is termed by Paul.
   And knowing that these temptations, rightly used, must serve for the
   improvement of the inner man, and for this purpose were ordained of
   God; he therefore calls upon Christians not to be disquieted, but to
   rejoice in these sufferings, bearing in mind the end which they must
   promote for the children of God. The right improvement of suffering, on
   Christian grounds, is therefore presupposed, as indicated by James in
   the succeeding words: "Knowing that the trial of your faith worketh
   patience." It is here implied, that faith has its appointed process of
   development and purification in this life,--a process consisting in an
   unceasing conflict. Faith is in his view something radically different
   from, and elevated above, every other governing principle in man;
   something endued with an inward divine power; which must, however,
   approve itself in conflict with this opposing power, with all which
   proceeds from the flesh, from the natural man. There are indeed
   manifold trials of faith, and to all these the words of James apply.
   But it is the conflict with external circumstances, which is here
   especially meant. Here then is it to be tested, whether the faith is
   genuine, deep-rooted in the inner life; such an one as, through
   indwelling divine power, is able to overcome the world. The opposite
   case is presented by Christ, in what he says of the stony ground; where
   indeed the seed of the word springs up quickly, but soon withers
   because it has no sap (Luke viii. 6); a conviction which is not a firm
   and deeply rooted one, and in time of temptation vanishes away (v. 13).
   But so long as faith approves itself in this warfare, holds out in the
   conflict with the world, it demonstrates thereby its divine power. The
   test becomes an attestation. From the victorious contest faith comes
   forth with a confirmed constancy, and constancy manifests itself as a
   fruit of faith. It is by this means that the Christian first learns
   what he himself possesses.

   Ch. i. 4, 5.] But James well understood the character of the churches
   whom he addressed; and that among them the idea of faith was liable to
   the perversion of which we have spoken. It is everywhere his aim to
   counteract this one-sided tendency to the particular and the external.
   Hence he adds, that even if faith had thus approved itself as
   steadfast, in these outward conflicts with the world, yet this one
   thing alone would not constitute the Christian life. In manifold
   directions, must faith pervade the entire life, and manifest its power.
   "Let steadfastness," he adds (or as Luther translates it, patience),
   "have its perfect work." Luther understood this of time; it was to
   approve itself as perfect by persevering even to the end. But from the
   connection with what follows, and from the whole connection and course
   of thought in the Epistle, we should rather understand it thus: To the
   faith which has approved itself as steadfast, must correspond all the
   works pertaining to faith, the entire sum of the acts in which faith
   expresses its inward character. But James, in reference to the unity of
   the whole Christian life, designates the entire Christian course, all
   Christian action, as one perfect work,--as must be the case in order to
   correspond to true faith. Thus we can rightly understand what he
   immediately adds: "that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing;"
   implying that with persevering faith connects itself the whole sum of
   the true Christian walk. By completeness is not meant an absolute
   perfection, nowhere to be found in the Christian life on earth; but, as
   often elsewhere in the Scriptures, all which belongs to Christian
   maturity, to what Paul terms Christian manhood,--as by wholeness
   ("entire") is meant the exclusion of whatever would mar the Christian
   life. When he desires that they may be wanting in nothing, he has in
   mind the aggregate of all qualities, powers, and capacities which
   Christianity develops, when its efficacy is fully proved as a leaven
   for the entire nature of man. Hence he subjoins a direction, intended
   to encourage them under the consciousness of any deficiency in this
   respect. He shows them what they must themselves do, if they would
   attain to that also, in which they are still deficient. What he might
   have expressed in wholly general terms, applicable to everything in
   which they might be conscious of deficiency, he applies (with his usual
   preference for the specific over the general idea) to that point
   especially wherein these particular churches might feel, or ought to
   feel, their need. Above all things was needed true wisdom, to give to
   the whole life its proper reference to the kingdom of God. Wisdom, or
   prudence (for which in the original the same word is used,--the
   prudence grounded in wisdom and subservient to it, the prudence of
   wisdom, of Christian love, being alone regarded as genuine) is by our
   Lord himself often held up as the chief object of attainment. But, as
   already remarked, there prevailed in these churches, as a fruit of the
   Jewish spirit, a proneness to a vain show of wisdom, to the
   over-estimation of mere knowledge, the conceit of knowledge and wisdom.
   So much the more did. they need to be admonished, that true wisdom is
   based upon humility; that it is not to be learned in the schools from
   Doctors of the Law; that it can be obtained only from the fountain of
   eternal light. Hence James adds to what he has already said, "If any of
   you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally
   [with simplicity], and upbraideth not: and it shall be given him." Thus
   he counsels them, when they feel the consciousness of their
   deficiencies, to turn to God in prayer. God is designated as he who
   gives with simplicity, i. e. out of pure love, for the mere sake of
   giving,--simplicity being here contrasted with a liberality apportioned
   and limited by self-interest. He is represented as he who reproaches no
   one with his benefits, but who is ever ready still to give, if there
   only exists a susceptibility for his gifts. They should not turn then
   to such teachers as hold back from them a part of the truth, impart to
   them grudgingly, and reproach them with their indebtedness; but to the
   love of a Heavenly Father, who gives without measure and is ever ready
   to give.

   It is prayer, therefore, which James represents as the condition
   required of the believer, in order that he may share in the
   communication from that heavenly fountain. This is the necessary
   relation between impacting and receiving in divine things. God alone
   being the Creator and Bestower, the human spirit can here only hold the
   attitude of a recipient. And this direction of the spirit, in order to
   receive what God is ready to impart, consists in prayer. The direction
   of the soul towards God in the feeling of personal need, and in the
   conviction that God alone can and will satisfy it, the longing towards
   God of the spirit hungering and thirsting after wisdom,--this is
   prayer. To seek the truth from God, and to pray, are one and the same
   thing. The whole life of the spirit, filled with this longing and
   impelled by it towards God, is prayer. So in those words of Christ,--to
   seek, to knock, in order to find the hid treasure, and to pray, are all
   classed together: "Ask and it shall be given you, seek and ye shall
   find, knock and it shall be opened unto you." (Matt. vii. 7.)

   Ch. i. 6-8.] But in addressing churches so ensnared by tendencies to
   the outward in religion, it was all the more necessary to warn them
   against this in respect to prayer; which only then deserves the name,
   when it is tile voice of the spirit itself, breathed from its inmost
   depths; lest they should suppose prayer in words, without that
   direction of the soul to God, to be all that was required. This warning
   is contained in the following words: "But let him ask in faith, nothing
   wavering." Trust in God is here represented as that direction of the
   spirit, from which prayer must proceed. To the eye of faith God must be
   present, as He to whom the prayer is directed. There must be the
   assurance, that he can and will supply the wants uttered before him, in
   order that it may be true prayer, prayer of the heart and not merely of
   the lips. The reason is immediately added, why prayer of the opposite
   character will not be heard. "For he that wavereth is like a wave of
   the sea, driven with the wind and tossed." Thus the steadfast direction
   of the soul to God is essential to prayer. But where there is doubt,
   there this ruling bias of the soul towards God is wanting. When, on the
   one side, the soul feels itself drawn towards God, and trust in Him
   begins to awaken; then on the other, the worldly tendency asserts
   itself, and strives to check the budding emotions of faith and trust.
   Hence the man, who is drawn hither and thither by conflicting
   inclinations, is compared to the wave, driven to and fro by storm and
   flood. James represents such a man as one who is at variance with
   himself, one in whom there exist, as it were, two souls; [3] who is
   unstable in all his ways, fickle-minded, unreliable in all his actions.
   Such is the character of his whole life, and his prayer answers to his
   life. In this it is implied, therefore, that prayer must be in
   consonance with the steadfast direction of the whole life towards God;
   all must originate in one and the same temper of heart.

   But here the question may be asked: How is this faith which is
   essential to prayer, to be obtained? Is one to abstain from prayer,
   because he lacks this measure of faith? But as in the words of our Lord
   above quoted, it is the necessary condition on which every gift of God
   is bestowed, that we knock, that we seek, that we ask of God; most
   surely faith is to be included, which is the gift of God, and always
   represented as something divinely wrought in man. He who is conscious
   of his lack of faith, who desires to believe more, to become stronger
   in faith, must in this also seek of God that wherein he is wanting. As
   that unhappy father in the Gospel narrative, of whom believing
   confidence was required in order to the healing of his son, cried out
   under a sense of the weakness of his faith, "Lord, help my unbelief!";
   so will the feeling of that want of which we are speaking, of that lack
   of faith which stands opposed to true prayer, itself impel to prayer
   for strength to believe. He who is assaulted by doubts will turn his
   back upon doubt,--upon the world which threatens to ensnare his soul in
   unbelief, and will look to God; turning away from doubt, he will give
   himself to prayer. Thus through prayer will faith increase, and the
   strengthened faith will in its turn lend new power, new wings to
   prayer.

   Ch. i. 9-11.] Thus have we seen how James, beginning with the
   exhortation to steadfastness under sufferings, was led on from one
   suggestion to another. Turning now his thoughts to the poor, who
   constituted a majority of these Christians, and who had much to suffer
   from the oppression of the rich, he addresses to them the consoling
   words: "Let the brother of low degree rejoice [glory] in that he is
   exalted." Instead of being cast down by the sense of his poverty, his
   low estate in respect to earthly relations, the Christian should rather
   feel himself raised above them, by the consciousness of an exaltation
   transcending all height of worldly honor; of that divine exaltation
   which is founded in the divine life, in the dignity of the Sons of God.
   This glorying he enjoins, with no occasion to apprehend
   self-exaltation; for the glory here spoken of is not one which man owes
   to his own powers and efforts; it is a dignity bestowed on him by God
   alone. This glorying is, therefore, the very opposite of all pride and
   self-exaltation, and can exist only in connection with true humility.
   But as this dignity is not adjudged to the poor on account of their
   poverty, so are the rich by no means excluded from it by their riches;
   although as we have already shown, these may to many become a hindrance
   in the way of their attaining it. To the rich, too, the way is pointed
   out, by which they may attain to that high dignity. "Let the rich,"
   says James, "glory in that he is made low." That is: by humbling
   himself on account of that which passes with the world as great, he
   attains to the consciousness of that true dignity, which springs only
   from a sense of the nothingness of all earthly greatness. By this
   conviction of the worthlessness of his earthly riches, he is prepared
   to appropriate as his own the true riches, the only true dignity.
   Self-abasement is the path to true exaltation. So long as the rich man
   prides himself upon his wealth, and fancies that therein he possesses
   the true riches, the feeling of necessity for heavenly possessions, for
   true greatness, will not germinate in his heart. This very feeling of
   need, this desire, is the necessary condition of personal
   participation. Thus poor and rich among Christian brethren, must be
   united to each other by the same consciousness of equal dignity. James
   then goes on to picture the vanity of riches, by images drawn from the
   natural scenery of the East. Like the fresh grass, which at morning
   stands in all its flowery splendor, but under the scorching breath of
   the south wind suddenly withers and dies, so will the rich man perish
   in his ways. As he has his treasure only in earthly things, and has
   wholly merged himself in them, to him is transferred what is said of
   the vanity of those possessions, which he has made his all.

   Ch. i. 12-15] But the sufferings of the oppressed Christians are ever
   before the mind of James. Having spoken of these sufferings as trials
   for the verifying of their faith, he now extols as happy the righteous
   who endures temptation; since, by thus approving himself, he would win
   the victor's crown of eternal life, which the n Lord has promised to
   all who love him. But how shall we reconcile with this the warning, not
   to ascribe temptations to God, which James immediately adds? Does he
   not regard God, as having himself ordained these sufferings as a means
   of testing faith? But there are different applications of this term,
   and we must distinguish between outward and inward temptation. The
   difficulties which beset one from without, may serve to awaken in him
   the latent power of the higher life. But they may also show his inward
   weakness,--may become the point of connection for that which stands
   opposed to the divine life. That which might otherwise have been the
   means of attesting, his faith or Christian virtue, through his own
   fault becomes temptation to unbelief or to sin. Thus the outward
   temptation becomes an inward one, and thereby endangers the soul. When
   Christ bids us pray: Lead us not into temptation, this can certainly be
   no other than inward temptation; for his disciples were to be left
   behind, in the midst of those temptations of the world which should
   serve as tests of their faith. The object of the petition must have
   been, that the outward might not become an inward temptation. In like
   manner, James, in his use of the word, passes from one of these related
   ideas to the other.

   But he must have found special reason for this warning in the peculiar
   state of these churches; and the explanation is to be sought in that
   same spirit of externalizing, of which we have already spoken. As this
   spirit shows itself in the conception of what is good, so does it also
   in the conception of sin. At no time have there been wanting grounds of
   excuse for sin; which men have regarded as something cleaving to them
   from without, and have sought its origin in merely external causes,
   instead of tracing it to its inward source in the faulty direction of
   the will. So it would seem that many in these churches excused
   themselves, on the plea that they were in subjection to a higher power,
   which hurried them away into sin. The Almighty, whom no one is able to
   withstand, has plunged them into these temptations. To this James
   replies: "Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God;" for
   as God cannot be tempted by aught that is evil, being elevated above
   all evil, so neither from him can temptation to sin proceed. The Holy
   One can tempt none to sin. He then lays open the fountain of temptation
   in man's own bosom, and describes the process by which the sinful
   tendency gains ground in progressive steps, till its final development
   in outward act. The source of temptation, he represents as lying in
   those desires inherent in every man, by which he is excited and led
   away; which lie in wait for him, as it were, but which he has power to
   withstand. They gain strength only because they are not resisted;
   because he who might subject them to himself, submits himself to them.
   Thus prevailing, thus ripened into fruit, lust bringeth forth sin; and
   sin completed in act is followed by death.

   We are by no means to infer, as is clear from the connection of thought
   in this passage, that these desires are not in their own nature sinful;
   or that the prevailing sinful tendency of the will would not involve
   death, even if it should find no expression in outward act, as though
   all turned on the outward act alone. The thought is this: Evil, from
   the first breaking forth of desire, proceeds on in ascending stages of
   development, until,--overpowering all the opposing influences of the
   higher life,--it is consummated in act. In this consummation in act is
   shown an increased strength of sin; and though man was previously able,
   by overcoming the enticements to sin, to maintain and to reestablish in
   himself the true life; yet now, through sin which has gained the
   victory over him, he falls a prey to death. James, therefore, warns
   them against indulging in such false and delusive ideas, as that God
   can be the author of evil.

   Ch. i. 16, 17.] Having thus directed them to look for the source of
   temptation in themselves alone, and warned them against supposing that
   temptations could come from God; he now further opposes to this
   delusion the thought,--that only whatever is good, whatever is true,
   proceeds from Him. As he is the Father of all material light, so is he
   also the Father of all spiritual light. With him, therefore, can be no
   alternation of light and darkness. From him, the unchangeable fountain
   of light raised above all darkness, nothing which tempts to evil can
   proceed. As light and all that is good, so darkness and all that is
   evil, are uniformly classed together in the Holy Scriptures.

   Ch. i. 18.] From this general thought, James now passes again to its
   application to himself and his readers. To God alone were they indebted
   also for the dawning of the divine light on them, and for the new life
   thereby imparted. "Of his own will begat he us, with the word of truth,
   that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures." We here
   perceive in James, as in Paul, the opposite of the Jewish tendency to
   the outward. He presupposes in the Christian a moral transformation,
   wrought from within. The word of truth, the divine power of the Gospel,
   is that whereby the new higher life has been produced. He too describes
   this as something not consequent upon any human desert; all are
   indebted for it to the will of Him from whom all good proceeds. He too
   characterizes this moral transformation as a new creation. Those in
   whom it was first effected, he describes as the first-born of this
   creation; since from them it should continue to spread, till its final
   completion in a world pervaded and transformed by the divine principle
   of life.

   Ch. i. 19-21.] But it is ever the manner of James to pass at once from
   the general to the particular; a trait originating partly in his own
   personal character, partly from the peculiar practical necessities of
   those to whom he was writing. He knew their disposition to content
   themselves with the general thought, without making an application of
   it to their own life. To incite them to this was his constant aim. He
   therefore proceeds at once to show how the divine word, received into
   the soul as the generative principle of the new creation, must manifest
   itself in the course of life. Neither does this take the form of a mere
   generality in his mind; but he passes directly to the special
   application most opposed to the practical errors of these churches. We
   have already remarked on the propensity among them to assume the office
   of teacher,--the inclination to talk much and to do little; how they
   were thus led to pass judgment lightly upon others, to revile them, and
   how every passion found herein its nourishment. Against this he warns
   them in the words: "Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be
   swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath." One extreme must be
   driven out by the other. There is a self-willed silence, and there is a
   self-willed forwardness to speak. He who is inclined to be too inert
   and passive, to hold his peace when he ought to speak out boldly, must
   be exhorted not to give himself thus wholly to silence, but to be
   willing to speak when duty requires. But James is dealing with those,
   among whom the very opposite fault prevailed; those who lacked the
   sobriety, patience, and humility, to hear before they spoke; and of
   course he must make use of the opposite exhortation. As a warning
   against the temptation to anger, easily furnished by over-hasty
   speaking, he tells them that passion is least of all adapted to effect
   the work of piety. "For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness
   of God." From the particular instance he now returns to the general
   thought with which he started, placing the two in close connection with
   each other. As passion forces man towards the outward, withdrawing him
   from the call, ever-deepening inner life of the spirit, and banishing
   again from the heart that generative principle of the new creation, the
   Word of God, instead of allowing it to penetrate more and more the
   inner spiritual nature: he therefore counsels them to purify themselves
   from all that is evil, all excrescences of the inward life which
   passion nourishes, and in meekness to suffer the word implanted in
   their hearts to take deeper and deeper root therein. So shall they
   attain to the salvation of the soul, through the power of this word
   thus penetrating more and more their entire life. "Wherefore" (namely,
   because anger is in contrariety to the divine righteousness, and is the
   rank soil of every evil thing)--"lay apart all filthiness and
   superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted
   word which is able to save your souls." James, it is true, is
   addressing those in whom the ground of salvation was already laid; but
   he presupposes also, that they can only become partakers of salvation,
   by continuing to build on that foundation, and to yield submission to
   the word which they have once received, that they may experience in
   themselves its purifying and transforming power.

   Ch. i. 22-24.] Having constantly in mind the practical errors under
   which these churches were suffering, he comes back again and again to
   the warning against that delusive tendency to exalt the outward. He
   exhorts them, not to imagine that it is sufficient to have a mere
   knowledge of the word, to be intellectually conversant with it. He
   warns them against the self-deception, that by such a knowledge merely
   they had complied with what he has just said, had really received the
   word into their life, had thus become Christians. The essential point
   is, the practical application of the word to the life. Herein must it
   manifest its efficacy, as a principle which works from within upon the
   outward character, and takes possession of the entire life. He says to
   them: "But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving your
   own selves." He sets this in a clear light by a familiar illustration.
   He compares him who receives the word with the understanding only,
   without applying it to the life, to one who, having seen his image in a
   mirror, goes away and immediately forgets how he looked. Thus he who
   merely busies himself in a superficial way with the divine word, may
   have learned indeed what is the true aspect of his life in relation to
   the divine Law and its demands. A light has dawned upon his mind, as to
   what he is and should be. But turning away again from the divine word,
   hurried along by the current of life and by his own passions, he
   immediately forgets it all like him who just saw his image in the
   mirror, and all is of no avail. "For if any one be a hearer of the word
   and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a
   glass; for he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway
   forgetteth what manner of man he was."

   Ch. i. 25.] With him who thus contents himself with a mere superficial
   study of the word of God, in whom knowledge and practice are at
   variance with each other, James now contrasts one who has looked into
   the depths of the divine Law, and lives in that contemplation. He here
   marks the distinction between the law of the letter, in its nature
   external, and that which Christianity has made the inner law, the law
   of the spirit, received into the inner life. This he calls the perfect
   law, in contrast with the law of Moses viewed only in its externality,
   which as such,--that is, as a law of the letter merely,--can bring
   nothing, to perfection, but leaves everything as it found it. The
   former he calls the law of liberty, inasmuch as it makes him free who
   has received it into his inner life, in contrast with the bondage of
   the letter. To this law one cannot hold the relation of a mere external
   hearer. Whoever has actually received it into himself as the perfect
   law, the law of liberty, is constrained by an inward impulse to
   manifest it in the outward life. "But whoso looketh into the perfect
   law of liberty, and continueth therein, lie being not a forgetful
   hearer, but a doer of the word, this man,"--he adds,--"shall be blessed
   in his deed."

   But how does this accord with Paul's representation, of the
   characteristic difference between the relations established by the Law
   and the Gospel, when he gives as the watchword of the former, "Do this
   and thou shalt live" (who does it, he shall live therein); and of the
   latter, "The just shall live by faith?" There would indeed be a
   contradiction here, if James were speaking of the Law in the same sense
   as Paul,--if he meant that by works of law one could merit salvation.
   But this is far from James' purpose. He is speaking of the Law, as made
   by faith in Christ a living inward principle; of that Law as Christ
   unfolds it in the Sermon on the Mount, and which presupposes and
   includes in itself faith. In this view he may justly say, that one must
   feel himself blessed in the practice of this Law, and in this way alone
   can become a partaker of that blessedness which Christ imparts to the
   believer. It is precisely the same thing as Christ himself says, at the
   close of the Sermon on the Mount: "Whosoever heareth these sayings of
   mine and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his
   house upon a rock." Certainly, to this Paul also would have assented.
   To this certainly corresponded his own manner of teaching,--that only
   he can experience in himself the divine power of faith, can be blessed
   through faith, who furnishes the evidence of it in his life; faith
   being in his view that inward principle, which works from within the
   transformation of the whole life, that faith which works by love; as he
   himself says: "Though I had all faith, so that I could remove
   mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing." (1 Cor. xiii. 2.)

   Ch. i. 26, 27.] James now passes once more from the general to the
   particular, to the special application of what he has just said on this
   principle of active obedience. The case which he presents, as requiring
   special notice, is selected with a view to the peculiar circumstances
   and faults of these churches. Writing to other churches he might have
   selected other examples. "If any man among you seem to be religious,
   and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's
   religion is vain." James takes for his starting-point the Christian
   principle, that religion must embrace the whole life. Hence he calls
   that religion merely imaginary, seeming, unreal, which allows the
   continuance of the moral defects originally predominant in the
   character; as, for example, in the application to these churches, that
   tendency to passionate anger, that want of control over the tongue. Of
   those who continued to live on thus as before, and yet made pretensions
   to religion, James says that they deceived themselves, that their
   religion was vain. Here again, in contrasting with this that religion
   which is genuine, showing itself in the life, he adduces the particular
   acts in which such a religion must manifest itself; in this, too,
   making the selection with special reference to the circumstances of
   these churches. To take the part of the orphan and the widow, to
   protect them against the pride and oppression of the rich,--this is
   pure and genuine religion. "Pure religion and undefiled before God and
   the Father, is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their
   affliction, and to keep themselves unspotted from the world." He thus
   closes again with the general; the injunction, to keep one's self pure
   from all defilement by the world, having reference to the whole
   Christian life. He does not mean that external, often falsely conceived
   opposition to the world, which would hinder the Christian from serving
   as the true salt and the true leaven for the world. This would stand in
   direct contradiction with that course of active labors in the world,
   which James everywhere enjoins in this Epistle. He means that one
   should keep himself inwardly unspotted from the world; that while
   externally acting upon it, he should guard himself against the
   infection of its impurity; that he should remain superior to the world,
   pure from the world whilst acting upon it. There are two things,
   therefore, essential to true religion and inseparable in it: viz.
   conflict against the evil which is in the world, the practical exercise
   of love; and in connection therewith, the keeping oneself inwardly pure
   from all ungodliness that reigns in the world. The former, moreover,
   cannot truly subsist except in connection with the latter.

   Ch. ii. 1.] We have already spoken of the distinction between the large
   numbers of the poor, and the much smaller number of the rich, in these
   churches. Diversities and inequalities of condition, originating in the
   natural organization and relations of society, were not to be clone
   away by Christianity, but rendered less grievous; were to be equalized
   by the common bond of love, and made a ground for the exercise of this
   Christian love. If it be true, (a matter on which we cannot decide with
   certainty) that the first glow of Christian enthusiasm gave rise for
   the time to a proper community of goods; yet was this a state of things
   adapted only to that period, when the new feeling of fellowship with
   each other in the divine life burst forth with a power, which for a
   while swallowed up all individual distinctions. But this could not be
   permanent. The inequalities founded in nature must at length re-appear,
   and the individual and personal be again allowed its just claims. Only
   the feeling should still remain, which united all as one heart and one
   soul; and through the love that cared for the wants of all, made as it
   were a common stock of the possessions of all. But this was now wanting
   in these churches; and the differences of rank and wealth were no
   longer repressed by the consciousness of that higher Christian
   equality. Hence, in opposition to such an unchristian aristocracy,
   James says: "My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ
   the Lord of Glory, with respect of persons." He thus expresses the
   contradiction, between the disposition to estimate the worth of
   believers by such temporal advantages, and faith in Jesus as the Lord
   of Glory! To him who acknowledges Jesus as such, the one dignity of
   belonging to him must seem so great, that all personal advantages of an
   earthly nature must be less than nothing in comparison. His glory, in
   which all believers are called to participate, far outshines all
   earthly splendor.

   Ch. ii. 2-4.] He then proceeds with a more specific application of this
   reproof. "For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring,
   in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man, in vile raiment:
   and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto
   him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou
   there, or sit here under my footstool: are ye not then partial in
   yourselves [at strife with yourselves], and are become judges of evil
   thoughts?" [4] The Greek word which we have translated "at strife with
   yourselves," indicates a state in which solicitude, doubt, conflicting
   thoughts, arise in the soul; as is the case where the simplicity of
   faith is disturbed, and discordant aims, worldly thoughts, take
   precedence of that one sole interest which should be all in all to the
   Christian. Here then are meant, in contrast with the Christian view of
   the equality of all who stand related in Christian fellowship, those
   worldly and foreign views, which give an undeserved deference to one,
   while they deny to another the respect due him as a member of the same
   community. These are the evil thoughts of which he speaks.

   Ch. ii. 5, 6.] He now goes on to show them, from the history of the
   spread of Christianity at this very time, from the living example of
   the present, how entirely such a way of judging is opposed to the
   Christian stand-point. He appeals to the fact, that on the poor
   pre-eminently have been bestowed the highest dignity of the Christian
   calling, the greatest riches in faith, the heirship of the kingdom of
   Heaven. And they despised the poor, whom God had so highly exalted!
   "Hearken, my beloved brethren; Hath not God chosen the poor of this
   world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised
   to them that love him? But ye have despised the poor." We must here
   remark once more, that when James here speaks of the kingdom of God as
   promised to those that love him,--this love of God, in his sense of the
   words, is doubtless to be understood as connected with faith. He means
   Christian love; which presupposes the revelation of the redeeming love
   of God in Christ, and the consciousness of this love received through
   the Holy Spirit.

   Ch. ii. 6, 7.] In contrast with these poor, among whom the calling of
   God pre-eminently found access, he places the rich who oppress the
   Christians, who drag them before the judgment-seat,--if not on account
   of their faith, yet for the sake of extortion,--who blaspheme that holy
   name by which Christians are called. "Do not rich men oppress you, and
   draw you before the judgment-seats? Do they not blaspheme that worthy
   name by which ye are called?" We suppose that by the rich here are
   meant, such of the rich as were opposers of Christianity. James makes
   use of the well-known fact, that while the poor more readily received
   the Gospel, the proudly rich showed themselves the violent enemies of
   Christians and of Christianity. It is possible, indeed, though this
   would be less suited to the intended contrast, that rich men who called
   themselves Christians are meant; who might be said to blaspheme the
   name of Christ, through the scandal which they brought upon it by their
   course of life.

   Ch. ii. 8-13.] He calls on them to consider, how entirely such a course
   is at variance with the essential principle of the divine life,--viz.
   with Love. With him, too, Love is the fulfilling of the Law. "If ye
   fulfil the royal law, according to the Scriptures, Thou shalt love thy
   neighbor as thyself, ye do well. But if ye have respect to persons, ye
   commit sin, and are convinced of the Law as transgressors." But he was
   dealing with persons ensnared on all sides in the outward and formal;
   who, therefore, among the transgressions of the Law (which they could
   not comprehend in its full majesty and strictness) made a difference in
   degree, as measured by an external standard; and who, judging by such a
   standard, might suppose it easy to satisfy the claims of the Law. To
   them such a predominance of the egoistic, as was shown in that
   preference of the rich, and that contempt of the poor, seemed no very
   grievous sin. It was therefore necessary to admonish them that the Law,
   as an expression, in one indivisible whole, of the divine will the
   divine holiness, demands absolute obedience; that only by such an
   obedience can one be justified, and that in every single act of
   transgression the whole Law is broken. "For whosoever shall keep the
   whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For Ile
   that said, Do not commit adultery; said also, Do not kill. Now if thou
   commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of
   the Law." Accordingly in applying this principle, in the sense of
   James, to the special case here spoken of, we must say: He who, in this
   one thing, permits his conduct to be determined by that selfishness
   which is in conflict with the law of love, has thereby violated the
   whole Law. He has violated it in reference to its substance, as the
   expression of the divine will wherein all is of equal dignity; and in
   reference to the ruling motive of his conduct, Self in opposition to
   Love.

   Does James then mean, that in judging of sinful agents and acts no
   differences in degree can be admitted? By no means. It is only
   necessary to distinguish here between the abstract and the concrete,
   according as the question respects the principle itself in the
   unqualified strictness of its demands, or the varying relations which
   human agency bears to it; inasmuch as, while all must acknowledge
   themselves guilty before the Law, there may be gradations in guilt,
   according as the higher nature of man has more or less asserted its own
   freedom and superiority, or as the disturbing element of self may still
   show its predominance. Certainly James could not intend to say that any
   one, even among Christians, wholly meets the demands of the Law. The
   higher his conception of the dignity of the Law, as already shown, and
   the stronger his opposition to the usual standard of merit as
   consisting in particular external acts and observances,--the less could
   such a view be attributed to him. What immediately follows is to the
   same effect. It is assumed that, however different may be the actions
   of men, all appear as guilty in the sight of the Law. But as Christ
   teaches us to pray: Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors; so
   does James exhort, that by exercising gentleness and mercy, in the
   consciousness of still remaining sin, we should show ourselves meet
   subjects of the divine compassion. Christians should speak and act with
   the continual sense of their need of divine mercy; then will meekness
   in speech and action be its spontaneous expression, and mercy triumph
   over strict justice. In this view, therefore, he calls the law by which
   the Christian is judged, a law of liberty. For he is no longer under
   the yoke of a law requiring absolute obedience, which none can render,
   as the condition of salvation; but is connected with a law which is
   fulfilled by the free obedience of love, not of fear,--in the
   consciousness of sins forgiven and confiding reliance on the mercy of
   God. "So speak ye and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of
   liberty. For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath showed no
   mercy, and mercy rejoiceth against judgment."

   Ch. ii. 14-19.] As James everywhere marks the distinction between
   appearance and reality; and opposes those tendencies which make
   appearance pass for reality; as he declares himself against dependence
   on mere knowledge of the law without a corresponding course of life,
   against a pretended piety which does not show itself in works of love;
   so, from the same point of view and with the same connection of ideas,
   does he condemn a faith which fails to show itself in corresponding
   good works. "What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath
   faith, and have not works? can faith save him?" It should be carefully
   noted, that James does not say; if one has faith,--but if he professes
   to have it. He speaks of a merely professed faith, not of that which is
   genuine. Of such a faith, which by its want of good works proves itself
   to be spurious, he declares that salvation is not to be attained by it.
   In the view of Paul also, good works are necessary fruits of true
   faith. One which professed to be such, and yet was wanting in these
   fruits, he would not have regarded as justifying faith, indeed would
   not have allowed it the name of faith. The meaning of James is clear
   from the illustration which follows. Faith without works, he compares
   to that love which never manifests itself in deeds, and is shown only
   in professions. "If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of
   daily food, and one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed
   and filled: notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are
   needful to the body: What doth it profit? Even so faith, if it hath not
   works, is dead being alone [is in itself dead].

   When James says that faith without works is dead, he certainly could
   not mean that works, the mere outward and phenomenal, constitute the
   living element of faith, that through them it becomes a living faith.
   On the contrary, he presupposes that true faith has life in itself, has
   in itself the living principle from which alone works can proceed, and
   that in works it makes itself known. The want of works was to him a
   proof that life was wanting in that faith, and hence he calls it a dead
   faith. He introduces a third person, speaking from James' own point of
   view with him who professes to have faith without works, and proving to
   him that the one cannot exist without the other. "Yea, a man may say,
   Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith without thy works,
   and I will show thee my faith by my works." In this James
   proposes,--for it is he who says this in the person of another,--to one
   who boasts of his faith though he has no works, that he should make the
   trial of showing to him the existence of his faith without the aid of
   works. To James it would be easy, by his works to show the faith which
   animates him, and in the strength of which those works were performed.
   As a proof that such a faith without works is of no value, he adduces
   the faith of evil spirits. Faith in God, in its true sense, can only
   there exist where he is consciously recognized as the highest good,
   where the whole life has reference to him; that faith which includes in
   itself a living fellowship with God,--a practical, not merely
   intellectual faith. With evil spirits, on the contrary, the
   consciousness of dependence on the Almighty and Supreme forces itself
   upon them against their will. They would gladly throw off this
   dependence, but they have not the power. It is something merely
   passive, with which their own free inclination, the self-moved
   submission of the spirit, has nothing to do. It is not a faith of the
   heart, but merely of the intellect; presenting God as in opposition to
   the spirit striving to escape from him,--God the Almighty, only as an
   object of fear to the spirit estranged from him, and unwilling to
   acknowledge him. "Thou believest there is one God; thou doest well: the
   devils also believe, and tremble."

   Ch. ii. 20-24.] By the Jews Abraham was claimed, as the representative
   of the faith in one God in the midst of nations devoted to idolatry;
   and therein was placed (as by others indeed in his circumcision) his
   great significance. James therefore proceeds to show, that the
   significance of this faith did not consist in a passive belief of the
   understanding in one God. It was a devotion of the whole life to God.
   It proved its genuineness by works of self-denial; by his readiness, in
   love to God and reliance upon him, in confiding resignation to his
   will, to deny all natural feelings and make of the object dearest to
   himself an offering to God. He, therefore, who would follow Abraham in
   his faith and by that faith be justified before God, must also attest
   his faith by like works of self-denial. "But wilt thou know, O vain
   man, that faith without works is dead? Was not Abraham our father
   justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?"
   Thus might he say, that faith and works must here have wrought
   together. How wrought together? For the justification of man before
   God? So that Abraham could not appear as one justified before Him,
   until after the works had been performed? Had James intended this, it
   must have been on the supposition, that God can know man only so far as
   he manifests himself in outward acts. He could not therefore have
   recognized him as the omniscient God, who looks into the heart, and
   discerns the inward feeling before it comes to light. Recognizing his
   omniscience, he must have known that to the eye of God, this faith,
   which afterwards showed itself in such works of self-denial, already
   appeared as genuine justifying faith. But speaking from the stand-point
   of human consciousness, taking into account only the outward
   manifestation, he might so express himself; viz. that faith and works
   wrought together for justification. So also when he says, that "by
   works was faith made perfect," he could not mean that works,--the mere
   outward phenomena of faith,--are that which perfects faith itself; but
   only that in them faith shows itself genuine and complete, the
   attestation of faith in the life and conduct. "Seest thou how faith
   wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? And the
   Scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was
   imputed unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of
   God." And in that sense he then says: "Ye see then, how that by works a
   man is justified, and not by faith only."

   Ch. ii. 25, 26.] To the example of Abraham he now adds that of Rahab.
   Here, also, against the false Jewish position, that this heathen woman
   was justified on the ground of passive faith in the One God, he
   declares that this faith was required to approve itself in works, the
   fruits of an inward disposition, contemning for the honor of God all
   worldly considerations. "Likewise also, was not Rahab the harlot
   justified by works, when she received the messengers, and had sent them
   out another way?" He concludes the whole discussion with the words:
   "For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is
   dead also." In this comparison, faith without works answers to the dead
   body without the animating spirit. But it is only because the point of
   comparison is not fully brought out. We cannot suppose him to mean,
   that works answer to the spirit; for the spirit is certainly the
   inward, animating principle. Works, would answer to the activity of the
   living body. He means then: the want of works is proof that the faith
   is a dead one, destitute of the vital principle, and is therefore to be
   compared to a body which is dead.

   Ch. iii. 1, 2.] James then passes to another, and at first view
   apparently quite different topic. But upon nearer inspection, it is
   found to be closely connected with the foregoing. For the very same
   tendency which made a merit of merely knowing and talking of the Law,
   of an empty show of faith without a corresponding life; would also lead
   men to set themselves up as teachers of others, and to have much to say
   in the assemblies of the church, without the inward call to this work.
   "My brethren, be not many masters [be not many of you teachers]." As
   the ground of this warning, he refers to the increased responsibility
   which one draws upon himself, by assuming to be the teacher of others;
   "knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation." The ground of
   the tendency in these churches, to make so light a matter of teaching,
   was that very want of self-examination and self-knowledge, which had so
   much to do with all the faults rebuked by James. Under the influence of
   that superficial moral judgment, which took into account only the
   outward and apparent, they could not rightly estimate the importance of
   words. It was not considered, that speaking itself was an act, and was
   to be judged by a moral standard; and that one may sin, not less by the
   immoral use of speech than by any other act. He bids them beware of
   this danger. He shows how hard it is, to observe the just measure, to
   exercise the proper self-control, in the use of speech; what injury may
   proceed from a single word; and by this he would admonish them, to be
   so much the more conscientious in taking upon themselves the office of
   speaking. He who considered well that responsibility and its danger,
   could not so lightly resolve upon assuming it. Accordingly he says: "If
   any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to
   bridle the whole body." That is: He who on all occasions, exercises
   self-control in the use of words, will also be able to exercise the
   same in all other respects.

   Ch. iii. 3-8.] He then proceeds to show, by many striking examples
   drawn from actual life, what power may reside in things seemingly
   trivial, --how much depends on the government of the tongue. "Behold we
   put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us, and we turn
   about their whole body. Behold also the ships, which though they be so
   great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a
   very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth. Even so the tongue
   is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold how great a
   matter [forest] a little fire kindleth! And the tongue is a
   fire,"--(that is, as a spark can set a whole forest on fire, so may a
   word spoken by the tongue be the occasion of great mischief)--"a world
   of iniquity: so is the tongue amongst our members, that it defileth the
   whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature [life], and it is
   set on fire of hell." By this is meant, that as the tongue is set on
   fire by the flames of hellish passion, so from the tongue does the fire
   spread over the whole course of life. He then shows how vain a thing is
   man's dominion over the natural world, if he, aspiring to rule the
   world, is himself through passion a slave of the world; what a reproach
   it is to man, claiming subjection from all animals, not to be able to
   bridle his own tongue. "For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of
   serpents, and things in the sea, is tamed and hath been tamed of
   mankind. But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of
   deadly poison."

   Ch. iii. 9-12.] The show of piety James opposes in all its forms. Such
   is that pious cant, in which, along with praise to God in words, are
   mingled a hateful censoriousness and bitter denunciation of men, in
   whom God's image is to be honored. James exposes the inherent
   inconsistency of such conduct, which to his view is mere hypocrisy.
   "Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men,
   which are made after the similitude of God. Out of the same mouth
   proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so
   to be. Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and
   bitter? Can. the fig-tree, my brethren, bear olive berries, either a
   vine figs? So can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh." Thus
   does James express the ground-thought of this whole Epistle, viz. that
   all turns on the inward temper from which the whole life takes its
   direction; and nothing could be more remote from that tendency, opposed
   by him at all points, which confines its regard to the merely external,
   to single acts and empty show.

   Ch. iii. 13.] As James has contended against a false faith,
   unaccompanied by works,--so does he, in like manner, against that
   knowledge and wisdom in divine things, which does not make itself known
   by a living activity in a corresponding course of life. He requires of
   all religions knowledge, that it approve itself, as a product of the
   divine life of the spirit, in a course of conduct proceeding from that
   inner life. "Who is a wise man, and endued with knowledge amongst you?
   Let him show out of a good conversation, &c." With this view, he gives
   special prominence to that which stood most opposed to the faults of
   these churches; contrasting with the unbridled passion of those who
   made such account of their knowledge, the spirit of meekness as being
   the mark of genuine wisdom and knowledge: "let him show . . . his works
   with meekness and wisdom."

   Ch. iii. 14-16.] "But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your
   hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth." It is the inward
   temper which, in his view, marks genuine knowledge also, genuine
   wisdom. This must derive its being from above, must be the product of
   the divine life, and through its divine impress must make itself known
   also in the outward life. The opposite proceeds from a principle of the
   natural man, not from that which is divine. For the Holy Scriptures
   often designate, under the name of the Flesh, everything evil, all
   which stands opposed to the Spirit of God, to the divine life. When the
   term is used in this general sense, it includes also the spiritual
   nature of man,--the reason, the soul, in so far as it has not been made
   subject to the Divine Spirit, but claims an independent being, to be
   something in its own right,--independently of God and aside from God,
   and hence in opposition to him. All this is comprehended in the idea of
   the Flesh, in that Biblical sense. It is by no means limited to what we
   call Flesh, sensuality in the narrower sense of the term. From Flesh,
   understood in this more general sense, is distinguished in biblical
   usage that which in the narrower sense is designated as natural, [5]
   --viz. the spiritual nature of man (the reason, the soul) as being
   unlike to God, and conformed to the world. Reason, however highly
   developed and cultivated, remains still within the bounds of the
   natural man. It is of this James speaks; and this with him is the same
   which actuates apostate spirits. "This wisdom descendeth not from
   above, but is earthly, sensual [natural], devilish. For where envying
   and strife is, there is confusion, and every evil work."

   Ch. iii. 17.] He then enters more fully into particulars, and describes
   the traits which characterize genuine wisdom. Ile does this with
   special reference indeed to the false conceit of wisdom among these
   churches, but yet in a manner practically useful for all times. As
   characteristic of the wisdom that comes from above, he names first,
   purity,--i. e. freedom from all worldly stain; then love of peace,--the
   truly wise not being stubbornly attached to his own opinion and
   contentious in support of it; then, that it is gentle, is easily
   persuaded,--i. e. ready to listen to others, willing to be taught, to
   acknowledge what is wrong on its own part, and to adopt the better way.
   All this gives evidence of victory attained over the love of self. The
   wisdom which is from above he farther characterizes, as full of mercy
   and good fruits,--meaning that knowledge and action must go together.
   We have already explained, in connection with a previous passage, [6]
   what James means by being in conflict with oneself. This he now
   excludes from the idea of genuine wisdom. He demands an inward harmony
   of soul, the stability of conviction; that the soul shall not be
   distracted by the discordant views, the mental conflicts of this state
   of unbelief. It is difficult to indicate his meaning in a single word.
   Candor, simplicity, perhaps comes nearest to the idea. Finally, true
   wisdom is without hypocrisy.

   Ch. iii. 18.] In what James has thus far said, his main object has been
   to oppose the contentious spirit of this conceit of wisdom. He now
   brings the opposite trait more prominently forward, by asserting that
   it is only in peace, in unity, that every Christian interest can
   prosper. "And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace, of them that
   make peace." "Fruit of righteousness" may, in biblical usage, be
   variously understood. It may denote either the blessing which
   righteousness brings with it,--fruit for life eternal; or the fruits of
   righteousness in the works which it produces. But though the words are
   true in both senses, the latter seems to be the one intended by
   James,--and his meaning is: the seeds of all that is truly good in
   action, proceeding from righteousness, can only prosper where there is
   peace, and with those whose conduct tends to peace. Where all is
   strife, nothing truly Christian can prosper.

   Ch. iv. 1, 2.] This leads him to speak, in general, of the source of
   the many controversies in these churches. This he finds in those
   insatiable desires which allow no one to be at rest. "From whence come
   wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your lusts,
   that war in your members?" Like Paul, James here presupposes an inward
   conflict in man, the conflict between flesh and spirit. As the power of
   evil is by Paul termed the law in the members, because in the body is
   the outward manifestation of man, and there the dominion of sinful
   desire shows itself; so James, in like manner, speaks of the lusts that
   war in the members. In the case of the unrenewed, the power of the
   sinful desires is opposed only by the activity of man's higher
   spiritual nature, which is too weak, however, to gain the victory over
   the opposing force. This conflict, which leads to no decisive result,
   and leaves man in unreconciled disunion with himself, is described by
   Paul in the seventh chapter of his Epistle to the Romans. It is
   otherwise with the Christian, the regenerated man. In him also this
   conflict is continued, but with this difference,--that in him the
   higher spiritual nature has been strengthened through the divine life
   imparted to him, whereby he is enabled to overcome the opposing sinful
   desires. But he must maintain the conflict in order to gain the
   victory; otherwise, the evil principle gains upon him more and more,
   and may at length succeed in wholly extinguishing the higher life.
   James exhorts to the maintenance of this warfare, and gives warning of
   the danger which threatens him who intermits it, as was the case with
   many in these churches. For there were doubtless many here, as appears
   from the rebukes of James, who called themselves Christians, but were
   yet strangers to the new birth, and stood in just the same relation to
   these two opposite tendencies as those who still belonged wholly to the
   world. Hence James says to them: "Ye covet" (namely earthly goods which
   ye may use in the service of your lusts) "and have not; ye kill, and
   desire to have [ye hate and envy], and cannot obtain."

   In the original of the above passage it is said, "Ye murder." Luther
   has translated it "Ye hate," not without reason so far as respects the
   meaning; for it is hardly possible that James should speak of murder,
   in the proper sense, as so prevalent. But James purposely, without
   doubt, selects the very strongest expressions, in order to designate
   with the utmost precision the nature of that evil, which, whatever may
   be the outward form of manifestation, is still the same. Thus murder
   stands as the climax in the expression of hate and envy. For in the
   very nature of hatred and envy lies the desire, to remove their object
   out of the way. The selfishness which here betrays itself, sees in the
   existence of that object an obstacle to its wishes, from which it would
   gladly be freed. Even if the overt act has not yet been committed, and
   the power of the higher tendency is still too great to allow it, yet
   does it lie in the very nature of the emotion; and the divine word
   reveals to us, in the concealed germ of the heart, the very same thing
   which afterward, when expressed in act, becomes an object of general
   abhorrence. Hence Christ declares in the Sermon on the Mount, in
   opposition to the mere external conception of the Mosaic Law, that
   whosoever is angry with his brother, is in danger of the judgment, i.
   e. of damnation. And the Apostle John says: "Whosoever hateth his
   brother is a murderer."

   Ch. iv. 2, 3.] James now directs them, as he had done at the beginning
   of the Epistle, to the fountain of all good, whence alone they could
   obtain all that was wanting to them, the supply of all their
   necessities. The ground of their unceasing and fruitless efforts, only
   involving them in strife, through the collision of selfish interests,
   he finds in their disposition to do for themselves, that which they
   should seek from God alone in the spirit of humble submission. To their
   neglect of prayer, which alone can procure a blessing on labor, he
   ascribes their vain endeavors and contentions. Such were not wanting
   indeed in these churches, as connected a certain habit of prayer with
   all the other external practices of religion, and proceeding from the
   same temper of heart. But such prayer he characterizes as one which
   could bring no fruit, because it was not the true prayer of the heart,
   and did not proceed from the right disposition of the soul towards God.
   It was merely the expression of earthly desire, seeking to make God
   subservient to itself; for they sought from Him only what they might
   use for the gratification of their lusts. "Ye fight and war, yet ye
   have not, because ye ask not. Ye ask and receive not, because ye ask
   amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts."

   Ch. iv. 4, 5.] He returns continually to the radical evil, the want in
   the soul of the one determining ground-tone in the reference of the
   life. to God; the direction of the whole spirit to the world, in
   connection with many external practices of religion. As in the Old
   Testament, the union of the people with God is represented under the
   image of a marriage, their apostasy from God under that of adultery; so
   James addresses them as adulterers, inasmuch as they claimed to be
   worshipers of God, and yet served only the world. He admonishes them
   that God requires the whole heart, that it cannot be divided between
   God and the world; that either love to God or love to the world must be
   the animating principle; that devotion to the world, as the aim of
   effort, a love of the world which seeks in the world its highest good,
   cannot exist without hostility towards God,--as the Lord himself says:
   Ye cannot serve God and Mammon. "Ye adulterers, and adulteresses, know
   ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever
   therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God." James
   reminds them in general of the declarations of the Holy Scripture,
   which everywhere testifies of the incompatibility of these two radical
   tendencies. "Or," says he to them, "suppose ye that the Scripture saith
   in vain, The Spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy [is a jealous
   spirit]?" This spirit, he would say, can suffer no other to share with
   itself; where it would take up its abode, it excludes the love of the
   world.

   Ch. iv. 6-8.] "But,"--to the above warning he immediately subjoins the
   consolation,--"He giveth more grace;" more, to wit, than that already
   bestowed, provided only that the one radical condition is fulfilled, in
   the entire submission of the heart, in the humbly receptive spirit. He
   reminds them of the passage from the Proverbs: "God resisteth the
   proud, but giveth grace unto the humble." Even if those, to whom his
   Epistle was directed, were not chargeable with the pride of
   unbelief,--they were yet wanting in the ground-tone of humility, the
   abiding sense of dependence on God, the ever-present consciousness that
   they were nothing and could do nothing without God. This want betrayed
   itself in excessive reliance on earthly possessions and human means.
   The prevalence of a worldly spirit always originates in want of
   humility. For this reason James admonishes them, that God withholds his
   gifts and aid from the proud, since the necessary condition on the part
   of the creature for the reception of every communication on the part of
   God, is wanting to them. But where humility is found, there is a
   susceptibility for the communication of all divine grace. He says to
   those, who pleaded in excuse for sin the irresistible temptations of
   Satan, or the withholding of divine grace, that it was their own fault
   if they thus fell. All depended on the direction of their own will. In
   order to resist the Evil One, who has power over no one except by his
   own consent, they needed but to humble themselves before God, to turn
   to Him in the consciousness of dependence. Thus will God impart himself
   to them, and thus will the Evil One be compelled to flee. "Submit
   yourselves therefore to God: resist the Devil and he will flee from
   you. Draw nigh unto God and he will draw nigh unto you."

   Ch. iv. 8-10.] The inward and the outward James comprehends as one.
   Purity of heart from all worldly stains, must show itself in purity of
   the outward conduct. This is expressed by James (who delights to embody
   truth in a specific form) as keeping the hand, the instrument of sin,
   pure from every sinful act; and purity of life, exhibited in the
   external walk, must lead back again to its source, inward purity of
   heart. "Cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purify your hearts, ye
   double-minded" (divided between God and the world). The Greek term
   expresses the idea (which we have already explained [7] ) of a man who
   has as it were two souls; to whom is wanting the true harmony of the
   inner life, which proceeds only from the all-controlling direction of
   the soul to God; of the man who is divided between opposite tendencies
   to God and to the world. Such a spiritual state is in direct
   contrariety with that sanctification of the heart, which James
   requires; it being the very ground of true sanctification, that but one
   soul should dwell in man, that in all things the single animating
   principle should be love to God. It was therefore necessary, first of
   all, to arouse those who were sunk in worldly pleasure to a sense of
   the vanity of such enjoyments, to the wretchedness of their condition.
   A godly sorrow must be awakened in them; the anguish of repentance as a
   ground of true joy,--the joy in God of those who are dead to the world
   and wholly devoted to Him. So Christ says in the Sermon on the Mount,
   with which we find so many points of harmony in this Epistle: Blessed
   are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted. "Be afflicted" (feel
   your wretchedness), "and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned
   to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. Humble yourselves in the sight
   of the Lord, and he shall lift you up."

   Thus James comprehends all in self-abasement before God, as the
   condition of all true exaltation, which comes alone from God; as the
   Saviour has said: Whoso exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that
   humbleth himself shall be exalted. James here speaks of an inward act
   of the spirit, not of one which can become an object of outward
   perception; although this inward act must make itself known in the
   outward form of the whole life. Hence he says,--abasement before God,
   in the eye of God, as that which can take place only between the soul
   and God. Here too the relation is such as man can sustain to God alone,
   not to any created being. He who is conscious to himself of such a
   relation to God, for that very reason will be far from placing himself
   in a similar relation to any human being. As his whole life thus has
   its root in conscious dependence on God, he will thereby be secured
   from every form of bondage to man.

   Ch. iv. 11, 12.] The want of humility showed itself in that proneness
   to judge censoriously of others. Here was a twofold expression of the
   want of humility, in reference to the Law. He who judges thus
   censoriously of others, is far from humbling himself before that holy
   law; from comparing his whole life therewith, and discovering how great
   is the chasm between his life and its demands.

   Hence James says, that such an one makes himself the judge of the Law,
   the lawgiver, instead of applying the Law to himself and acting in
   accordance therewith. Such an one, he says, in speaking against his
   brother speaks against the Law, since he gives the lie to the Law that
   accuses him for judging another. Furthermore, such an one betrays the
   want of self-abasement before God,--inasmuch as he forgets how he
   himself, with him whom he accuses, stands in like dependence on the One
   sole Judge and Arbiter of happiness and misery. He sets himself in the
   place of the Supreme Judge, inasmuch as he presumes to anticipate his
   verdict. "Speak not evil one of another, brethren: he that speaketh
   evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law,
   and judgeth the law; but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of
   the law, but a judge. There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to
   destroy; who art thou that judgest another?"

   Ch. iv. 13-17.] The pride of the worldly spirit, in contrast with the
   nature of genuine humility, was the starting-point with which James
   commenced, and from, which he proceeded to reprove the various forms of
   evil in these churches. In like manner he now brings forward another
   specific case, connected however with the same radical tendency of
   which we have spoken. It was that false reliance upon the Human, which
   leads one to make calculations upon the future, without for a moment
   taking into account the insecurity of human life; to form prospective
   plans of earthly gain, as if one were entirely certain of the future.
   James thought it necessary to admonish those, who were thus absorbed in
   worldly pursuits, of the uncertainty of all human things; that every
   moment of life is dependent on the will of God and his providence. "Go
   to now ye that say, To-day or to-morrow we will go into such a city and
   continue there a year, and buy, and sell, and get gain: whereas ye know
   not what shall be on the morrow: for what is your life? It is even a
   vapor which appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away. For
   that ye ought to say, if the Lord will, we shall live, and do this or
   that." It is plain that in saying this, James did not mean to insist,
   that such a condition should always be expressed in words. For such
   expressions might easily degenerate into a mere form; and the tendency
   of these churches was to turn everything into form. Here again James
   shows his preference of the specific over the general. Instead of the
   general truth, of the uncertainty and dependence of the whole earthly
   life, he uses language adapted to suggest this general thought by its
   application to a particular case. From the particular he now passes
   over again to the general, and assails that false worldly and
   self-reliance in its whole extent. "But now ye glory in your vain
   confidence; all such glorying is evil." In closing this admonition, he
   warns them, that it is not enough to have known the truth here
   expressed; it was necessary,--and herein they chiefly failed,--that the
   known truth should pervade the life and control the conduct. "To him
   that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin."

   Ch. v. 1-6.] James now addresses himself to the rich, wholly immersed.
   in the spirit of the world. "Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for
   your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted and
   your garments moth-eaten: Your gold and silver is cankered, and the
   rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh,
   [as ye have treasured up fire] for the last days." He speaks of riches
   under three specific forms, viz. in the garnered fruits of the field,
   in garments, and in gold and silver. All these, he would say, the rich
   heap up without profit. Their treasures in gold and silver, allowed
   through disuse to consume with rust, will witness against them to their
   condemnation; showing their guilt in suffering to perish unemployed,
   that which they should have used for the benefit of others. The rust
   eats into their own flesh, inasmuch as it is a token of their own
   perishableness and of the judgment that overhangs them; as they,
   instead of gathering durable riches, have treasured up for themselves
   the fire of God's wrath in treasures accumulated for a prey to rust. He
   then describes the oppressions inflicted by the rich (not necessarily
   such as belonged to Christian churches) on the pious poor in humble
   life. "Behold, the hire of the laborers which have reaped down your
   fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and. the cries of
   them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of
   Sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth and been wanton; ye
   have nourished your hearts as in [for] a day of slaughter." That is; as
   one pampers the beast destined for slaughter, so have ye, giving
   yourselves up to the service of your lusts, and revelling in careless
   unconcern, prepared yourselves for the judgment that is hastening on.
   "Ye have condemned and killed the just, and he doth not resist
   you:"--the pious sufferer's patient resignation to God's will, in
   contrast with the pride and presumption of the oppressor.

   Ch. v. 7, 8.] He then turns to the Christian brethren, who had so much
   to suffer from the rich and powerful. He exhorts them to bear with
   patience every wrong, to wait submissively for the coming of the Lord,
   who will redeem his own from all evil, and will show himself the
   righteous judge of all. We must bear in mind, that the time of the
   Lord's coming was then looked for as already near at hand. It was
   natural, in the Apostolic age, so to regard it. Christ himself had not
   chosen to give any information respecting the time of his coming. Nay,
   he had expressly said, that the Father had reserved the decision to
   himself alone (Mark xiii. 32); that even the Son could determine
   nothing respecting it. But still, the longing desire of the Apostolic
   church was directed, with eager haste, to the appearing of the Lord.
   The whole Christian period seemed only as the transition-point to the
   eternal, and thus as something that must soon be passed. As the
   traveller, beholding from afar the object of all his wanderings,
   overlooks the windings of the intervening way, and believes himself
   already near his goal; so it seemed to them, as their eye was fixed on
   that consummation of the whole course of events on earth. It is from
   this point of view that James here speaks. "Be patient therefore,
   brethren, unto the coming of the Lord: behold the husbandman waiteth
   for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it,
   until lie receive the early and latter rain. Be ye also patient;
   stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh."
   James,--who, as already remarked, had all the oriental fondness for
   imagery drawn from natural objects,--here transfers to history the laws
   of gradual development in the phenomena of nature. As the fruits of the
   earth mature only by slow degrees, and the husbandman must wait
   patiently for the early and the latter rain; so there is needed the
   same constancy of patience, while anticipating the final consummation
   of earthly history, in its gradual course of development. Here, too,
   everything has its appointed time; and one must guard against that
   impatient haste, which is unwilling to wait for the successive stages
   of progress, and is eager to reach the end at once.

   Ch. v. 9-11.] He now proceeds to speak of the deportment of Christians
   towards each other, and commends the mutual exercise of long-suffering
   and forbearance. They should not indulge in mutual accusations,
   appealing to God against one another, but leave all to the judgment of
   God. They should not desire, by thus mutually condemning one another,
   to anticipate the Judge who will soon appear. His words remind us of
   our Saviour's admonition in the Sermon on the Mount: Judge not, that ye
   be not judged. "Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be
   condemned: behold the judge standeth before the door." He then sets
   before them the examples of the prophets as models of patience;
   especially the example of Job, in whom, after he had endured every
   trial of his patience, the mercy of God was so gloriously displayed.
   "Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the
   Lord, for an example of suffering affliction and of patience." The
   thought is doubtless this: They have spoken in the name of the Lord,
   and yet have suffered so much,--and that for the Lord's sake. If the
   prophets, so highly honored and speaking in the name of the Lord, have
   endured such suffering, how could we expect a different lot? "Behold we
   count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job,
   and have seen the end of the Lord" (i. e. the end brought about by him,
   the final issue which the Lord granted to all his trials); "that the
   Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy."

   Ch. v. 12.] Then follow particular admonitions and exhortations, all
   which, however, are opposed in spirit to such errors, as were the fruit
   of the leading evil tendencies in these churches. In the Sermon on the
   Mount, Christ has unfolded the whole Law in its spirituality and glory;
   everywhere converting the outward and particular to the inward, to the
   completeness and unity of the inward temper and disposition; at once
   abolishing and fulfilling the Law, abolishing it in the letter and
   fulfilling it in its spirit. Thus to the command: Thou shalt hallow the
   seventh day, is given its higher spiritual import,--Let every day be
   holy to thee. In like manner, the requirement to regard an oath as
   holy, becomes in its true spirit: Let every word be holy to thee, as
   being consecrated to the Lord,--as addressed to him, since he is ever
   before thine eyes. What an oath is to others, shall every word be to
   the Christian. Hence among true Christians, there will be no need of
   oaths; since to each his word is holy, and such is the mutual
   confidence of all, that the word of each is so received among them. So
   should it be in a truly Christian church, in which all are recognized
   as genuine Christians. But in these churches, where the proneness to
   much speaking had naturally led to a careless use of words, there now
   prevailed the Jewish habit of using many asseverations, in order to
   give their words a weight which they had not in themselves. Even if
   they shunned so frequent a use of the name Jehovah, they had other more
   covert forms of oath in its place,--the violation of which, however,
   they made less a matter of conscience. Against this James says
   expressly: "But above all things, my brethren, swear not; neither by
   Heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath. But let your
   yea be yea, and your nay be nay; lest ye fall into condemnation." That
   is, their Yea and Nay should suffice in place of every other form of
   confirmation; for if their word is not in itself sufficient, and
   requires the aid of protestations to procure belief, they bring
   themselves into condemnation.

   Ch. v. 13.] Then follows the general direction, which most of all
   stands opposed to the spirit of worldliness in these churches, to that
   tendency to distinguish between certain acts of religious worship and
   all the rest of life as belonging to the world. Nothing can be more
   opposed to such a tendency than the requirement, that every feeling of
   the Christian, in sorrow and in joy, shall take the form of prayer.
   Thereby are sorrow and joy to be sanctified and ennobled. In suffering,
   the feeling of pain shall be changed to the tone of prayer; from God is
   help to be sought in prayer,--power to sustain suffering and to be
   submissive under it. And joy, too, shall attune the heart to the praise
   of God, to gratitude towards Him to whom we owe every good. Thus shall
   sorrow and joy have this in common,--the direction of the heart towards
   God. And as life is divided between joy and sorrow, the whole life will
   thus become prayer. "Is any among you afflicted, let him pray. Is any
   merry, let him sing psalms."

   Ch. v. 14-18.] Having thus referred everything to prayer as the soul of
   the Christian life, he now makes a specific application of the
   principle to cases of sickness. Here there was need of mutual
   intercession in the name of the Lord. As the Presbyters acted in the
   name of the whole church, and each one as a member of the body felt
   that he needed its sympathy and intercession, and might count upon it;
   individuals should therefore, in cases of sickness, send for the
   Presbyters of the church. These were to offer prayer on their behalf.
   With this was connected a symbolical transaction,--practised indeed in
   many churches of the East, but never prescribed as a general
   usage,--the anointing with oil; of which Christ had sometimes made use
   in the healing of the sick, as an outward sign of healing and
   sanctifying power. If it was the will of the Lord, the sick should be
   restored to bodily health. But, however this might be, he should
   certainly receive spiritual refreshment, the renewed and strengthened
   consciousness of sin forgiven; and this could not but favorably affect
   his bodily state. "Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders
   of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in
   the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and
   the Lord shall raise him up: and if he have committed sins, they shall
   be forgiven him." We see that James ascribes the healing power, not to
   the anointing with oil, but to the prayer of faith. As he regards the
   Presbyters in the light of organs of the church, acting in its name; so
   does he hold all other Christians in such a relation, as members of one
   body, that they should mutually pray for one another in bodily and
   spiritual need; should confess their sins to one another, and pray for
   the forgiveness of each other's sins. He ascribes great efficacy to the
   prayer of fraternal love. "Confess your faults one to another, and pray
   one for another, that ye may be healed,"--whether spiritual and bodily
   healing united is meant, as in the last quoted passage, or merely
   spiritual healing. "The effectual fervent prayer of the righteous man
   availeth much." Of this efficacy of prayer he adduces examples from the
   Old Testament. But the Jewish tendency to externalize everything, led
   them to contemplate these holy men of old only from a distance, and as
   objects of veneration and wonder, not as examples for imitation. James
   therefore reminds them, that these men were frail mortals like
   themselves, and that the power of God can still work through the weak.
   This application was all the more appropriate, inasmuch as
   Christianity, by virtue of the common relation of Priest and Prophet
   belonging to all believers, had made that common to all which under the
   old dispensation had been the gift and prerogative of a few. "Elias was
   man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it
   might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three
   years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain,
   and the earth brought forth her fruit."

   Ch. v. 19, 20.] This exhortation to mutual intercession, in bodily and
   spiritual need, leads to this further admonition,--that they should not
   harshly spurn from them such as, in their religious and moral
   development, may have erred from the right way, but should interest
   themselves in their case and seek to lead them back to the truth: an
   admonition which they specially needed, who were so prone to defame and
   condemn. "Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one
   convert him, let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the
   error of his way, shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a
   multitude of sins." This, then, is in James' view the highest work of
   love,--to rescue the fallen brother from that spiritual death to which
   he is verging. More than to excite in one repentance for a single sin,
   and thereby prepare the way for attaining forgiveness of one sinful
   act,--more than this is the rescue of a soul from a life of sin, and
   the restoration of the new divine principle of life. By this the many
   sins are covered, in which his former course had plunged him. This
   explanation of the words seems most in harmony with the connection.
   But, by the sins here spoken of, might be understood the sins of him
   who thus rescues a brother from death. The meaning would then be: The
   love thus shown in active zeal for the spiritual welfare of another,
   shall cover many sins into which one may have fallen through infirmity
   of the flesh; inasmuch as Love outweighs all else, and above all else
   is adapted to subdue the still remaining evil of the heart. So we are
   taught by the Saviour himself, that to him who loveth much, much shall
   be forgiven. Were this the true meaning of the passage (which, however,
   is contrary to our view), still the covering of one's own sins would
   not be dependent on the success of his efforts for another; for this is
   not placed in the power of man, and he can gain nothing for himself
   thereby, for the very reason that it is something independent of his
   own purpose. It is the zeal of love, laboring for the conversion of
   another,--it is this that hides the multitude of sins!

   Thus closes this Epistle, in that spirit of love which breathes through
   it all, and which everywhere shows itself in the life and labors of
   James!
